Acknowledgements
This book would not exist if not for “Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics” by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus. It is the book I learned
discrete math out of, and taught out of the semester before I began writing
this text. I wanted to maintain the inquiry based feel of their book but
update, expand and rearrange some of the material. Some of the best
exposition and exercises here were graciously donated from this source.
Thanks to Alees Seehausen who co-taught the Discrete Mathematics
course with me in 2015 and helped develop many of the Investigate! activities and other problems currently used in the text. She also offered
many suggestions for improvement of the expository text, for which I am
quite grateful. Thanks also to Katie Morrison, Nate Eldredge and Richard
Grassl (again) for their suggestions after using parts of this text in their
classes.
While odds are that there are still errors and typos in the current
book, there are many fewer thanks to the work of Michelle Morgan over
the summer of 2016.
The book is now available in an interactive online format, and this is
entirely thanks to the work of Rob Beezer, David Farmer, and Alex Jordan
along with the rest of the participants of the pretext-support group.
Finally, a thank you to the numerous students who have pointed out
typos and made suggestions over the years and a thanks in advance to
those who will do so in the future.

Preface
This text aims to give an introduction to select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate for first or second year undergraduate math
majors, especially those who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics. The book began as a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics
course at the University of Northern Colorado. This course serves both as
a survey of the topics in discrete math and as the “bridge” course for math
majors, as UNC does not offer a separate “introduction to proofs” course.
Most students who take the course plan to teach, although there are a
handful of students who will go on to graduate school or study applied
math or computer science. For these students the current text hopefully
is still of interest, but the intent is not to provide a solid mathematical
foundation for computer science, unlike the majority of textbooks on the
subject.
Another difference between this text and most other discrete math
books is that this book is intended to be used in a class taught using
problem oriented or inquiry based methods. When I teach the class, I will
assign sections for reading after first introducing them in class by using
a mix of group work and class discussion on a few interesting problems.
The text is meant to consolidate what we discover in class and serve as a
reference for students as they master the concepts and techniques covered
in the unit. None-the-less, every attempt has been made to make the text
sufficient for self study as well, in a way that hopefully mimics an inquiry
based classroom.
The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of
the students I teach at UNC. The main areas of study are combinatorics,
sequences, logic and proofs, and graph theory, in that order. Induction is
covered at the end of the chapter on sequences. Most discrete books put
logic first as a preliminary, which certainly has its advantages. However,
I wanted to discuss logic and proofs together, and found that doing both
of these before anything else was overwhelming for my students given
that they didn’t yet have context of other problems in the subject. Also,
after spending a couple weeks on proofs, we would hardly use that at
all when covering combinatorics, so much of the progress we made was
quickly lost. Instead, there is a short introduction section on mathematical
statements, which should provide enough common language to discuss
the logical content of combinatorics and sequences.
Depending on the speed of the class, it might be possible to include additional material. In past semesters I have included generating functions
(after sequences) and some basic number theory (either after the logic

vii

viii

and proofs chapter or at the very end of the course). These additional
topics are covered in the last chapter.
While I (currently) believe this selection and order of topics is optimal,
you should feel free to skip around to what interests you. There are
occasionally examples and exercises that rely on earlier material, but I
have tried to keep these to a minimum and usually can either be skipped
or understood without too much additional study. If you are an instructor,
feel free to edit the LATEX or PreTeXt source to fit your needs.
Improvements to the 3rd Edition.
In addition to lots of minor corrections, both to typographical and mathematical errors, this third edition includes a few major improvements,
including:
• More than 100 new exercises, bringing the total to 473. The selection
of which exercises have solutions has also been improved, which
should make the text more useful for instructors who want to assign
homework from the book.
• A new section in on trees in the graph theory chapter.
• Substantial improvement to the exposition in chapter 0, especially
the section on functions.
• The interactive online version of the book has added interactivity.
Currently, many of the exercises are displayed as WeBWorK problems, allowing readers to enter answers to verify they are correct.
The previous editions (2nd edition, released in August 2016, and the
Fall 2015 edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use
those versions due to familiarity.
My hope is to continue improving the book, releasing a new edition
each spring in time for fall adoptions. These new editions will incorporate
additions and corrections suggested by instructors and students who use
the text the previous semesters. Thus I encourage you to send along any
suggestions and comments as you have them.

How to use this book
In addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to
encourage you to interact with the mathematics.
Investigate! activities.
Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very beginning of a
topic) you will find activities designed to get you acquainted with the topic
soon to be discussed. These are similar (sometimes identical) to group
activities I give students to introduce material. You really should spend
some time thinking about, or even working through, these problems
before reading the section. By priming yourself to the types of issues
involved in the material you are about to read, you will better understand
what is to come. There are no solutions provided for these problems, but
don’t worry if you can’t solve them or are not confident in your answers.
My hope is that you will take this frustration with you while you read
the proceeding section. By the time you are done with the section, things
should be much clearer.
Examples.
I have tried to include the “correct” number of examples. For those examples which include problems, full solutions are included. Before reading
the solution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem
is asking. Unlike some textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all
inclusive for problems you will see in the exercises. They should not be
used as a blueprint for solving other problems. Instead, use the examples
to deepen our understanding of the concepts and techniques discussed
in each section. Then use this understanding to solve the exercises at the
end of each section.
Exercises.
You get good at math through practice. Each section concludes with
a small number of exercises meant to solidify concepts and basic skills
presented in that section. At the end of each chapter, a larger collection of
similar exercises is included (as a sort of “chapter review”) which might
bridge material of different sections in that chapter. Many exercise have
a hint or solution (which in the pdf version of the text can be found by
clicking on the exercises number—clicking on the solution number will

ix

x

bring you back to the exercise). Readers are encouraged to try these
exercises before looking at the help.
Both hints and solutions are intended as a way to check your work,
but often what would “count” as a correct solution in a math class would
be quite a bit more. When I teach with this book, I assign exercises
that have solutions as practice and then use them, or similar problems,
on quizzes and exams. There are also problems without solutions to
challenge yourself (or to be assigned as homework).
Interactive Online Version.
For those of you reading this in a pdf or in print, I encourage you to
also check out the interactive online version, which makes navigating the
book a little easier. Additionally, some of the exercises are implemented
as WeBWorK problems, which allow you to check your work without seeing the correct answer immediately. Additional interactivity is planned,
including instructional videos for examples and additional exercises at
the end of sections. These “bonus” features will be added on a rolling
basis, so keep an eye out!

Introduction and Preliminaries
Welcome to Discrete Mathematics. If this is your first time encountering
the subject, you will probably find discrete mathematics quite different
from other math subjects. You might not even know what discrete math
is! Hopefully this short introduction will shed some light on what the
subject is about and what you can expect as you move forward in your
studies.

0.1

What is Discrete Mathematics?

dis·crete / dis’krët.
Adjective: Individually separate and distinct.
Synonyms: separate - detached - distinct - abstract.
Defining discrete mathematics is hard because defining mathematics is hard.
What is mathematics? The study of numbers? In part, but you also
study functions and lines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors
and . . . . Or perhaps you want to say that mathematics is a collection of
tools that allow you to solve problems. What sort of problems? Okay,
those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles, . . . . Whatever your
conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of “discrete”
to it, as defined above. Some math fundamentally deals with stuff that is
individually separate and distinct.
In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set
of numbers (maybe the set of numbers in the range of a function). You
would represent this set as an interval: [0, ∞) is the range of f (x)  x 2
since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater.
This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not
separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and
there are infinitely many more between them which are also in the set.
Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set
would not be an interval. Consider the function which gives the number
of children of each person reading this. What is the range? I’m guessing it
is something like {0, 1, 2, 3}. Maybe 4 is in there too. But certainly there is
nobody reading this that has 1.32419 children. This output set is discrete
because the elements are separate. The inputs to the function also form a
discrete set because each input is an individual person.
One way to get a feel for the subject is to consider the types of problems
you solve in discrete math. Here are a few simple examples:

Investigate!
Note: Throughout the text you will see Investigate! activities like this
one. Answer the questions in these as best you can to give yourself a feel
for what is coming next.
1. The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing
a party for all of his friends. As a way to kick things off,
they decide that everyone should shake hands. Assuming
all 10 people at the party each shake hands with every other
person (but not themselves, obviously) exactly once, how
many handshakes take place?
2. At the warm-up event for Oscar’s All Star Hot Dog Eating
Contest, Al ate one hot dog. Bob then showed him up by
eating three hot dogs. Not to be outdone, Carl ate five.
This continued with each contestant eating two more hot
dogs than the previous contestant. How many hot dogs did
Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat? How many hot
dogs were eaten all together?
3. After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial
chamber. The room is empty except for two large chests.
On each is carved a message (strangely in English):
If this chest is
empty, then the
other chest’s
message is true.

This chest is filled
with treasure or the
other chest contains
deadly scorpions.

You know exactly one of these messages is true. What
should you do?
4. Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they
wanted to build roads directly connecting each pair of towns.
While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long
and as winding as they wished, it was very important that
the roads not intersect with each other (as stop signs had
not yet been invented). Also, tunnels and bridges were not
allowed. Is it possible for each of these towns to build a
road to each of the four other towns without creating any
intersections?

One reason it is difficult to define discrete math is that it is a very
broad description which encapsulates a large number of subjects. In

0.1. What is Discrete Mathematics?

this course we will study four main topics: combinatorics (the theory of
ways things combine; in particular, how to count these ways), sequences,
symbolic logic, and graph theory. However, there are other topics that
belong under the discrete umbrella, including computer science, abstract
algebra, number theory, game theory, probability, and geometry (some
of these, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete
variants).
Ultimately the best way to learn what discrete math is about is to do
it. Let’s get started! Before we can begin answering more complicated
(and fun) problems, we must lay down some foundation. We start by
reviewing mathematical statements, sets, and functions in the framework
of discrete mathematics.

Mathematical Statements

Investigate!
While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three
trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a knight, who always tells
the truth, or a knave, who always lies. The trolls will not let you
pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave.
Each troll makes a single statement:
Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two
knights here.
Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.
Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is
a knight.
Which troll is which?

In order to do mathematics, we must be able to talk and write about
mathematics. Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has
mostly involved finding answers to problems. As we embark towards
more advanced and abstract mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.
Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many
other subjects, and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the
basic building blocks: mathematical statements.

Atomic and Molecular Statements
A statement is any declarative sentence which is either true or false.
A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements,
otherwise it is called molecular.
Example 0.2.1

These are statements (in fact, atomic statements):
• Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.
• The moon is made of cheese.
• 42 is a perfect square.
• Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the
sum of two primes.

0.2. Mathematical Statements

5

• 3 + 7  12
And these are not statements:
• Would you like some cake?
• The sum of two squares.
• 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + 2n + 1.
• Go to your room!
• 3 + x  12
The reason the sentence “3 + x  12” is not a statement is that it
contains a variable. Depending on what x is, the sentence is either true
or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the sentence into a
statement is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be
done by specifying a specific substitution, for example, “3 + x  12 where
x  9,” which is a true statement. Or you could capture the free variable
by quantifying over it, as in, “for all values of x, 3 + x  12,” which is false.
We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.
You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler
(atomic or molecular) ones using logical connectives. For example, this
is a molecular statement:
Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a
perfect square.
Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The
two shorter statements are connected by an “and.” We will consider 5
connectives: “and” (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), “or” (Sam is a
man or Chris is a woman), “if. . . , then. . . ” (if Sam is a man, then Chris is
a woman), “if and only if” (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman),
and “not” (Sam is not a man). The first four are called binary connectives
(because they connect two statements) while “not” is an example of a
unary connective (since it applies to a single statement).
These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must
be either true or false. The absolutely key observation here is that which
truth value the molecular statement achieves is completely determined
by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not
need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are
true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider
propositional variables (sometimes called sentential variables), usually
capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: P, Q, R, S, . . .. We think of
these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only

6

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

two values the variables can achieve: true or false.1 We also have symbols
for the logical connectives: ∧, ∨, →, ↔, ¬.
Logical Connectives.
• P ∧ Q is read “P and Q,” and called a conjunction.
• P ∨ Q is read “P or Q,” and called a disjunction.
• P → Q is read “if P then Q,” and called an implication or
conditional.
• P ↔ Q is read “P if and only if Q,” and called a biconditional.
• ¬P is read “not P,” and called a negation.
The truth value of a statement is determined by the truth value(s) of
its part(s), depending on the connectives:
Truth Conditions for Connectives.
• P ∧ Q is true when both P and Q are true
• P ∨ Q is true when P or Q or both are true.
• P → Q is true when P is false or Q is true or both.
• P ↔ Q is true when P and Q are both true, or both false.
• ¬P is true when P is false.
Note that for us, or is the inclusive or (and not the sometimes used
exclusive or) meaning that P ∨ Q is in fact true when both P and Q are true.
As for the other connectives, “and” behaves as you would expect, as does
negation. The biconditional (if and only if) might seem a little strange,
but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements
are equivalent in that they have the same truth value. This leaves only the
conditional P → Q which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics
than it does in ordinary usage. However, implications are so common and
useful in mathematics, that we must develop fluency with their use, and
as such, they deserve their own subsection.

1In computer programing, we should call such variables Boolean variables.

Implications
Implications.
An implication or conditional is a molecular statement of the form
P→Q
where P and Q are statements. We say that
• P is the hypothesis (or antecedent).
• Q is the conclusion (or consequent).
An implication is true provided P is false or Q is true (or both),
and false otherwise. In particular, the only way for P → Q to be
false is for P to be true and Q to be false.
Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form
conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the Pythagorean Theorem.
Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as “a 2 + b 2  c 2 .” This
is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has
three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any
values of the variables? So 12 + 52  22 ??? How can we fix this? Well, the
equation is true as long as a and b are the legs or a right triangle and c is
the hypotenuse. In other words:
If a and b are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse c,
then a 2 + b 2  c 2 .
This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the
conclusion (“then” part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis
(“if” part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations
when the hypothesis is false.2
Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement,
and therefore is either true or false. The truth value of the implication is
determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage
above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is
false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an
implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is
false.
2However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem, it is also the case that
if a 2 + b 2  c 2 , then a and b are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse c. So we
could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional: “a and b are the legs of a right
triangle with hypotenuse c if and only if a 2 + b 2  c 2 .”

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

Example 0.2.2

Consider the statement:
If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.
This is definitely an implication: P is the statement “Bob gets a 90
on the final,” and Q is the statement “Bob will pass the class.”
Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances
would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90
on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my
statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and
did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The
tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe
he passes the class, maybe he doesn’t. Did I lie in either case? I
think not. In these last two cases, P was false, and the statement
P → Q was true. In the first case, Q was true, and so was P → Q.
So P → Q is true when either P is false or Q is true.
Just to be clear, although we sometimes read P → Q as “P implies Q”,
we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the
statements P and Q. In particular, if you claim that P → Q is false, you
are not saying that P does not imply Q, but rather that P is true and Q is
false.
Example 0.2.3

Decide which of the following statements are true and which are
false. Briefly explain.
1. If 1  1, then most horses have 4 legs.
2. If 0  1, then 1  1.
3. If 8 is a prime number, then the 7624th digit of π is an 8.
4. If the 7624th digit of π is an 8, then 2 + 2  4.
Solution. All four of the statements are true. Remember, the only
way for an implication to be false is for the if part to be true and
the then part to be false.
1. Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true, so
the implication is true. It does not matter that there is no
meaningful connection between the true mathematical fact
and the fact about horses.
2. Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, so the
implication is true.

0.2. Mathematical Statements

3. I have no idea what the 7624th digit of π is, but this does
not matter. Since the hypothesis is false, the implication is
automatically true.
4. Similarly here, regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis,
the conclusion is true, making the implication true.
It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is
true, but in order to prove that it is. Proofs might seem scary (especially
if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are
really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you
understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the
outline for a proof.
Direct Proofs of Implications.
To prove an implication P → Q, it is enough to assume P, and from
it, deduce Q.
Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form
P → Q directly, you must explain why Q is true, but you get to assume P
is true first. After all, you only care about whether Q is true in the case
that P is as well.
There are other techniques to prove statements (implications and others) that we will encounter throughout our studies, and new proof techniques are discovered all the time. Direct proof is the easiest and most
elegant style of proof and has the advantage that such a proof often does
a great job of explaining why the statement is true.
Example 0.2.4

Prove: If two numbers a and b are even, then their sum a + b is
even.
Solution.
Proof. Suppose the numbers a and b are even. This means that
a  2k and b  2 j for some integers k and j. The sum is then
a + b  2k + 2j  2(k + j). Since k + j is an integer, this means that
a + b is even.
qed
Notice that since we get to assume the hypothesis of the implication, we immediately have a place to start. The proof proceeds
essentially by repeatedly asking and answering, “what does that
mean?” Eventually, we conclude that it means the conclusion.

10

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

This sort of argument shows up outside of math as well. If you ever
found yourself starting an argument with “hypothetically, let’s assume
. . . ,” then you have attempted a direct proof of your desired conclusion.
An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements. It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships
between the statements. Here we introduce some common language to
address this question.
Converse and Contrapositive.
• The converse of an implication P → Q is the implication Q →
P. The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original
implication. That is, whether the converse of an implication
is true is independent of the truth of the implication.
• The contrapositive of an implication P → Q is the statement
¬Q → ¬P. An implication and its contrapositive are logically
equivalent (they are either both true or both false).
Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which
have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that
number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it
is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if
a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.
However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true. For
example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: ifa 2 + b 2  c 2 ,
then the triangle with sides a, b, and c is a right triangle. Whenever you
encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask
whether the converse is true.
The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value
as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether
an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.
Example 0.2.5

True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular
deck, then you will have at least three cards all of the same suit. Is
the converse true?
Solution. True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze
because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But
consider the contrapositive: If you don’t have at least three cards all
of the same suit, then you don’t have nine cards. It is easy to see

0.2. Mathematical Statements

11

why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four
suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).
The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit,
then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades
and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an
implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis
is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the
conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).
Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand
implications and their truth values:
Example 0.2.6

Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93% on her final, then she will
get an A in the class. Assuming that what I said is true, what can
you conclude in the following cases:
1. Sue gets a 93% on her final.
2. Sue gets an A in the class.
3. Sue does not get a 93% on her final.
4. Sue does not get an A in the class.
Solution. Note first that whenever P → Q and P are both true
statements, Q must be true as well. For this problem, take P to
mean “Sue gets a 93% on her final” and Q to mean “Sue will get an
A in the class.”
1. We have P → Q and P, so Q follows. Sue gets an A.
2. You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A
because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do
not know that if Sue gets an A, then she gets a 93% on her
final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it
might or might not be true.
3. The contrapositive of the converse of P → Q is ¬P → ¬Q,
which states that if Sue does not get a 93% on the final, then
she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from
the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing.
Sue could have done extra credit.

12

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

4. What would happen if Sue does not get an A but did get a 93%
on the final? Then P would be true and Q would be false.
This makes the implication P → Q false! It must be that
Sue did not get a 93% on the final. Notice now we have the
implication ¬Q → ¬P which is the contrapositive of P → Q.
Since P → Q is assumed to be true, we know ¬Q → ¬P is
true as well.
As we said above, an implication is not logically equivalent to its
converse, but it is possible that both the implication and its converse are
true. In this case, when both P → Q and Q → P are true, we say that
P and Q are equivalent and write P ↔ Q. This is the biconditional we
mentioned earlier.
If and only if.
P ↔ Q is logically equivalent to (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P).
Example: Given an integer n, it is true that n is even if and only
if n 2 is even. That is, if n is even, then n 2 is even, as well as the
converse: if n 2 is even, then n is even.
You can think of “if and only if” statements as having two parts: an
implication and its converse. We might say one is the “if” part, and
the other is the “only if” part. We also sometimes say that “if and only
if” statements have two directions: a forward direction (P → Q) and
a backwards direction (P ← Q, which is really just sloppy notation for
Q → P).
Let’s think a little about which part is which. Is P → Q the “if” part
or the “only if” part? Consider an example.
Example 0.2.7

Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I’m in the shower. We
know this means both that if I sing, then I’m in the shower, and
also the converse, that if I’m in the shower, then I sing. Let P be
the statement, “I sing,” and Q be, “I’m in the shower.” So P → Q
is the statement “if I sing, then I’m in the shower.” Which part of
the if and only if statement is this?
What we are really asking for is the meaning of “I sing if I’m in
the shower” and “I sing only if I’m in the shower.” When is the first
one (the “if” part) false? When I am in the shower but not singing.
That is the same condition on being false as the statement “if I’m
in the shower, then I sing.” So the “if” part is Q → P. On the

0.2. Mathematical Statements

13

other hand, to say, “I sing only if I’m in the shower” is equivalent
to saying “if I sing, then I’m in the shower,” so the “only if” part is
P → Q.
It is not terribly important to know which part is the “if” or “only
if” part, but this does illustrate something very, very important: there are
many ways to state an implication!
Example 0.2.8

Rephrase the implication, “if I dream, then I am asleep” in as many
different ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse.
Solution. The following are all equivalent to the original implication:
1. I am asleep if I dream.
2. I dream only if I am asleep.
3. In order to dream, I must be asleep.
4. To dream, it is necessary that I am asleep.
5. To be asleep, it is sufficient to dream.
6. I am not dreaming unless I am asleep.
The following are equivalent to the converse (if I am asleep, then I
dream):
1. I dream if I am asleep.
2. I am asleep only if I dream.
3. It is necessary that I dream in order to be asleep.
4. It is sufficient that I be asleep in order to dream.
5. If I don’t dream, then I’m not asleep.
Hopefully you agree with the above example. We include the “necessary and sufficient” versions because those are common when discussing
mathematics. In fact, let’s agree once and for all what they mean.

14

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

Necessary and Sufficient.
• “P is necessary for Q” means Q → P.
• “P is sufficient for Q” means P → Q.
• If P is necessary and sufficient for Q, then P ↔ Q.
To be honest, I have trouble with these if I’m not very careful. I find it
helps to keep a standard example for reference.
Example 0.2.9

Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point c, then
it is continuous at c, but that the converse of this statement is not
true (for example, f (x)  |x| at the point 0). Restate this fact using
“necessary and sufficient” language.
Solution. It is true that in order for a function to be differentiable
at a point c, it is necessary for the function to be continuous at c.
However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at c
for it to be continuous at c.
It is true that to be continuous at a point c, it is sufficient that
the function be differentiable at c. However, it is not the case that
being continuous at c is sufficient for a function to be differentiable
at c.
Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also
help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what other facts
would be enough (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is
true.

It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences. For
example, suppose we wanted to claim that if n is prime, then n + 7 is not
prime. This looks like an implication. I would like to write something
like
P(n) → ¬P(n + 7)
where P(n) means “n is prime.” But this is not quite right. For one
thing, because this sentence has a free variable (that is, a variable that we
have not specified anything about), it is not a statement. A sentence that
contains variables is called a predicate.
Now, if we plug in a specific value for n, we do get a statement. In
fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for n, we get a true
implication in this case. What we really want to say is that for all values
of n, if n is prime, then n + 7 is not. We need to quantify the variable.
Although there are many types of quantifiers in English (e.g., many, few,
most, etc.) in mathematics we, for the most part, stick to two: existential
and universal.
Universal and Existential Quantifiers.
The existential quantifier is ∃ and is read “there exists” or “there
is.” For example,
∃x(x < 0)
asserts that there is a number less than 0.
The universal quantifier is ∀ and is read “for all” or “every.” For
example,
∀x(x ≥ 0)
asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.

16

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

As with all mathematical statements, we would like to decide whether
quantified statements are true or false. Consider the statement
∀x∃y(y < x).
You would read this, “for every x there is some y such that y is less than
x.” Is this true? The answer depends on what our domain of discourse
is: when we say “for all” x, do we mean all positive integers or all real
numbers or all elements of some other set? Usually this information is
implied. In discrete mathematics, we almost always quantify over the
natural numbers, 0, 1, 2, . . . , so let’s take that for our domain of discourse
here.
For the statement to be true, we need it to be the case that no matter
what natural number we select, there is always some natural number that
is strictly smaller. Perhaps we could let y be x −1? But here is the problem:
what if x  0? Then y  −1 and that is not a number! (in our domain
of discourse). Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a
number which is less than or equal to all other numbers. In symbols,
∃x∀y(y ≥ x).
To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the negation
was true. Notice how the negation and original statement compare. This
is typical.
Quantifiers and Negation.
¬∀xP(x) is equivalent to ∃x¬P(x).
¬∃xP(x) is equivalent to ∀x¬P(x).
Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier, but
that causes the quantifier to switch type. This should not be surprising: if
not everything has a property, then something doesn’t have that property.
And if there is not something with a property, then everything doesn’t
have that property.
Implicit Quantifiers.
It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics. Sometimes though,
we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention. An example
of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates
with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are
universally quantified.
For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a
rectangle? But how can that be true if it is not a statement? To be a little

0.2. Mathematical Statements

17

more precise, we have two predicates: S(x) standing for “x is a square”
and R(x) standing for “x is a rectangle”. The sentence we are looking at is,
S(x) → R(x).
This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement. But come on! We all
know that we meant to consider the statement,
∀x(S(x) → R(x)),
and this is what our convention tells us to consider.
Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between
a predicate and a statement. For example, we might write, let P(n) be the
statement, “n is prime,” which is technically incorrect. It is implicit that
we mean that we are defining P(n) to be a predicate, which for each n
becomes the statement, n is prime.

Sets

The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies (and really in
all of math) are sets. Much of what follows might be review, but it is
very important that you are fluent in the language of set theory. Most of
the notation we use below is standard, although some might be a little
different than what you have seen before.
For us, a set will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two
examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played The
Doctor on Doctor Who, or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10
inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is a element (or member) of the set,
while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also,
the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they
contain the exact same elements. For example, the set containing all of
the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as
the set of vowels in the word “questionably” (namely, all of them); we do
not care about order or repetitions, just whether the element is in the set
or not.

Notation
We need some notation to make talking about sets easier. Consider,
A  {1, 2, 3}.
This is read, “A is the set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3.” We use
curly braces “{, }” to enclose elements of a set. Some more notation:
a ∈ {a, b, c}.
The symbol “∈” is read “is in” or “is an element of.” Thus the above
means that a is an element of the set containing the letters a, b, and c.
Note that this is a true statement. It would also be true to say that d is not
in that set:
d < {a, b, c}.
Be warned: we write “x ∈ A” when we wish to express that one of the
elements of the set A is x. For example, consider the set,
A  {1, b, {x, y, z}, ∅}.
This is a strange set, to be sure. It contains four elements: the number
1, the letter b, the set {x, y, z}, and the empty set ∅  {}, the set containing
no elements. Is x in A? The answer is no. None of the four elements in
A are the letter x, so we must conclude that x < A. Similarly, consider
the set B  {1, b}. Even though the elements of B are elements of A, we

0.3. Sets

25

cannot say that the set B is one of the elements of A. Therefore B < A.
(Soon we will see that B is a subset of A, but this is different from being an
element of A.)
We have described the sets above by listing their elements. Sometimes
this is hard to do, especially when there are a lot of elements in the set
(perhaps infinitely many). For instance, if we want A to be the set of all
even natural numbers, would could write,
A  {0, 2, 4, 6, . . .},
but this is a little imprecise. A better way would be
A  {x ∈ N : ∃n ∈ N(x  2n)}.
Let’s look at this carefully. First, there are some new symbols to digest:
“N” is the symbol usually used to denote that natural numbers, which
we will take to be the set {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}. Next, the colon, “:”, is read such
that; it separates the elements that are in the set from the condition that
the elements in the set must satisfy. So putting this all together, we would
read the set as, “the set of all x in the natural numbers, such that there
exists some n in the natural numbers for which x is twice n.” In other
words, the set of all natural numbers, that are even. Here is another way
to write the same set.
A  {x ∈ N : x is even}.
Note: Sometimes mathematicians use | or  for the “such that” symbol
instead of the colon. Also, there is a fairly even split between mathematicians about whether 0 is an element of the natural numbers, so be careful
there.
This notation is usually called set builder notation. It tells use how
to build a set by telling us pricisely the condition elements must meet to
gain access (the condition is the logical statement after the “:” symbol).
Reading and comprehending sets written in this way takes practice. Here
are some more examples:
Example 0.3.1

Describe each of the following sets both in words and by listing out
enough elements to see the pattern.
1. {x : x + 3 ∈ N}.
2. {x ∈ N : x + 3 ∈ N}.
3. {x : x ∈ N ∨ −x ∈ N}.

26

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

4. {x : x ∈ N ∧ −x ∈ N}.
Solution.
1. This is the set of all numbers which are 3 less than a natural
number (i.e., that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number). The set could also be written as {−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}
(note that 0 is a natural number, so −3 is in this set because
−3 + 3  0).
2. This is the set of all natural numbers which are 3 less than a
natural number. So here we just have {0, 1, 2, 3 . . .}.
3. This is the set of all integers (positive and negative whole
numbers, written Z). In other words, {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}.
4. Here we want all numbers x such that x and −x are natural
numbers. There is only one: 0. So we have the set {0}.
There is also a subtle variation on set builder notation. While the
condition is generally given after the “such that”, sometimes it is hidden
in the first part. Here is an example.
Example 0.3.2

List a few elements in the sets below and describe them in words.
The set Z is the set of integers; positive and negative whole numbers.
1. A  {x ∈ Z : x 2 ∈ N}
2. B  {x 2 : x ∈ N}
Solution.
1. The set of integers that pass the condition that their square
is a natural number. Well, every integer, when you square it,
gives you a non-negative integer, so a natural number. Thus
A  Z  {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.
2. Here we are looking for the set of all x 2 s where x is a natural
number. So this set is simply the set of perfect squares. B 
{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, . . .}.
Another way we could have written this set, using more
strict set builder notation, would be as B  {x ∈ N : x 
n 2 for some n ∈ N}.

∈

2 ∈ {1, 2, 3} asserts that 2 is an element of the set {1, 2, 3}.

A ⊆ B asserts that A is a subset of B: every element of A is
also an element of B.

×

A × B is the Cartesian product of A and B: the set of all
ordered pairs (a, b) with a ∈ A and b ∈ B.

\

A \ B is A set-minus B: the set containing all elements of A
which are not elements of B.

Relationships Between Sets
We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal: they have
exactly the same elements. Thus, for example,
{1, 2, 3}  {2, 1, 3}.
(Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not
matter.) Also,
{1, 2, 3}  {1, 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1}  {I, II, III}  {1, 2, 3, 1 + 2}
since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive
integers (how we write them doesn’t matter, just what they are).
What about the sets A  {1, 2, 3} and B  {1, 2, 3, 4}? Clearly A , B,
but notice that every element of A is also an element of B. Because of this
we say that A is a subset of B, or in symbols A ⊂ B or A ⊆ B. Both symbols
are read “is a subset of.” The difference is that sometimes we want to say
that A is either equal to or is a subset of B, in which case we use ⊆. This
is analogous to the difference between < and ≤.

Example 0.3.3

Let A  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B  {2, 4, 6}, C  {1, 2, 3} and D  {7, 8, 9}.
Determine which of the following are true, false, or meaningless.
1. A ⊂ B.

4. ∅ ∈ A.

7. 3 ∈ C.

2. B ⊂ A.

5. ∅ ⊂ A.

8. 3 ⊂ C.

3. B ∈ C.

6. A < D.

9. {3} ⊂ C.

Solution.
1. False. For example, 1 ∈ A but 1 < B.
2. True. Every element in B is an element in A.
3. False. The elements in C are 1, 2, and 3. The set B is not equal
to 1, 2, or 3.
4. False. A has exactly 6 elements, and none of them are the
empty set.
5. True. Everything in the empty set (nothing) is also an element
of A. Notice that the empty set is a subset of every set.
6. Meaningless. A set cannot be less than another set.
7. True. 3 is one of the elements of the set C.
8. Meaningless. 3 is not a set, so it cannot be a subset of another
set.
9. True. 3 is the only element of the set {3}, and is an element
of C, so every element in {3} is an element of C.
In the example above, B is a subset of A. You might wonder what
other sets are subsets of A. If you collect all these subsets of A into a new
set, we get a set of sets. We call the set of all subsets of A the power set of
A, and write it P(A).
Example 0.3.4

Let A  {1, 2, 3}. Find P(A).
Solution. P(A) is a set of sets, all of which are subsets of A. So
P(A)  {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.

none of the elements in P(A) are numbers! On the other hand, we
do have {2} ∈ P(A) because {2} ⊆ A.
What does a subset of P(A) look like? Notice that {2} * P(A)
because not everything in {2} is in P(A). But we do have {{2}} ⊆
P(A). The only element of {{2}} is the set {2} which is also an
element of P(A). We could take the collection of all subsets of
P(A) and call that P(P(A)). Or even the power set of that set of
sets of sets.
Another way to compare sets is by their size. Notice that in the example
above, A has 6 elements and B, C, and D all have 3 elements. The size of a
set is called the set’s cardinality . We would write |A|  6, |B|  3, and so
on. For sets that have a finite number of elements, the cardinality of the
set is simply the number of elements in the set. Note that the cardinality
of {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} is 3. We do not count repeats (in fact, {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} is
exactly the same set as {1, 2, 3}). There are sets with infinite cardinality,
such as N, the set of rational numbers (written Q), the set of even natural
numbers, and the set of real numbers (R). It is possible to distinguish
between different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this
text. For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite; if it is finite, the we can
determine its cardinality by counting elements.
Example 0.3.5

1. Find the cardinality of A  {23, 24, . . . , 37, 38}.
2. Find the cardinality of B  {1, {2, 3, 4}, ∅}.
3. If C  {1, 2, 3}, what is the cardinality of P(C)?
Solution.
1. Since 38 − 23  15, we can conclude that the cardinality of the
set is |A|  16 (you need to add one since 23 is included).
2. Here |B|  3. The three elements are the number 1, the set
{2, 3, 4}, and the empty set.
3. We wrote out the elements of the power set P(C) above, and
there are 8 elements (each of which is a set). So |P(C)|  8.
(You might wonder if there is a relationship between |A| and
|P(A)| for all sets A. This is a good question which we will
return to in Chapter 1.)

Operations On Sets
Is it possible to add two sets? Not really, however there is something
similar. If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that
are in either set, then we can take the union of the two sets. Symbolically,
C  A ∪ B,
read, “C is the union of A and B,” means that the elements of C are exactly
the elements which are either an element of A or an element of B (or an
element of both). For example, if A  {1, 2, 3} and B  {2, 3, 4}, then
A ∪ B  {1, 2, 3, 4}.
The other common operation on sets is intersection. We write,
C A∩B
and say, “C is the intersection of A and B,” when the elements in C are
precisely those both in A and in B. So if A  {1, 2, 3} and B  {2, 3, 4},
then A ∩ B  {2, 3}.
Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as
to what “everything” is. Perhaps we are only concerned with natural
numbers. In this case we would say that our universe is N. Sometimes
we denote this universe by U. Given this context, we might wish to
speak of all the elements which are not in a particular set. We say B is the
complement of A, and write,
BA
when B contains every element not contained in A. So, if our universe is
{1, 2, . . . , 9, 10}, and A  {2, 3, 5, 7}, then A  {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}.
Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time. For
example, consider
A ∩ B.
This is the set of all elements which are both elements of A and not
elements of B. What have we done? We’ve started with A and removed
all of the elements which were in B. Another way to write this is the set
difference:
A ∩ B  A \ B.
It is important to remember that these operations (union, intersection,
complement, and difference) on sets produce other sets. Don’t confuse
these with the symbols from the previous section (element of and subset
of). A ∩ B is a set, while A ⊆ B is true or false. This is the same difference
as between 3 + 2 (which is a number) and 3 ≤ 2 (which is false).

32

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

Example 0.3.6

Let A  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B  {2, 4, 6}, C  {1, 2, 3} and D  {7, 8, 9}.
If the universe is U  {1, 2, . . . , 10}, find:
7. (D∩C)∪A ∩ B.
1. A ∪ B.
4. A ∩ D.
2. A ∩ B.

5. B ∪ C.

8. ∅ ∪ C.

3. B ∩ C.

6. A \ B.

9. ∅ ∩ C.

Solution.
1. A ∪ B  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  A since everything in B is already
in A.
2. A ∩ B  {2, 4, 6}  B since everything in B is in A.
3. B ∩ C  {2} as the only element of both B and C is 2.
4. A ∩ D  ∅ since A and D have no common elements.
5. B ∪ C  {5, 7, 8, 9, 10}. First we find that B∪C  {1, 2, 3, 4, 6},
then we take everything not in that set.
6. A \ B  {1, 3, 5} since the elements 1, 3, and 5 are in A but not
in B. This is the same as A ∩ B.
7. (D ∩ C) ∪ A ∩ B  {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The set contains all
elements that are either in D but not in C (i.e., {7, 8, 9}), or
not in both A and B (i.e., {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}).
8. ∅ ∪ C  C since nothing is added by the empty set.
9. ∅ ∩ C  ∅ since nothing can be both in a set and in the empty
set.
Having notation like this is useful. We will often want to add or
remove elements from sets, and our notation allows us to do so precisely.
Example 0.3.7

If A  {1, 2, 3}, then we can describe the set we get by adding
the number 4 as A ∪ {4}. If we want to express the set we get by
removing the number 2 from A we can do so by writing A \ {2}.
Careful though. If you add an element to the set, you get a new
set! So you would have B  A ∪ {4} and then correctly say that B
contains 4, but A does not.

0.3. Sets

33

You might notice that the symbols for union and intersection slightly
resemble the logic symbols for “or” and “and.” This is no accident. What
does it mean for x to be an element of A ∪ B? It means that x is an element
of A or x is an element of B (or both). That is,
x ∈A∪B

⇔

x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B.

x ∈A∩B

⇔

x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B.

x∈A

⇔

¬(x ∈ A).

Similarly,
Also,
which says x is an element of the complement of A if x is not an element
of A.
There is one more way to combine sets which will be useful for us: the
Cartesian product, A × B. This sounds fancy but is nothing you haven’t
seen before. When you graph a function in calculus, you graph it in
the Cartesian plane. This is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers
(x, y). We can do this for any pair of sets, not just the real numbers with
themselves.
Put another way, A × B  {(a, b) : a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}. The first coordinate
comes from the first set and the second coordinate comes from the second
set. Sometimes we will want to take the Cartesian product of a set with
itself, and this is fine: A × A  {(a, b) : a, b ∈ A} (we might also write A2
for this set). Notice that in A × A, we still want all ordered pairs, not just
the ones where the first and second coordinate are the same. We can also
take products of 3 or more sets, getting ordered triples, or quadruples,
and so on.
Example 0.3.8

Let A  {1, 2} and B  {3, 4, 5}. Find A × B and A × A. How many
elements do you expect to be in B × B?
Solution. A × B  {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}.
A × A  A2  {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}.
|B × B|  9. There will be 3 pairs with first coordinate 3, three
more with first coordinate 4, and a final three with first coordinate
5.

Venn Diagrams
There is a very nice visual tool we can use to represent operations on sets.
A Venn diagram displays sets as intersecting circles. We can shade the
region we are talking about when we carry out an operation. We can

34

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

also represent cardinality of a particular set by putting the number in the
corresponding region.

A

A

B

B

C
Each circle represents a set. The rectangle containing the circles represents the universe. To represent combinations of these sets, we shade
the corresponding region. For example, we could draw A ∩ B as:

A

B

Here is a representation of A ∩ B, or equivalently A \ B:

A

B

A more complicated example is (B ∩ C) ∪ (C ∩ A), as seen below.
A

B

C

Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way. We could have started with all of C, then excluded the region
where C and A overlap outside of B. That region is (A ∩ C) ∩ B. So the









above Venn diagram also represents C ∩ (A ∩ C) ∩ B . So using just the
picture, we have determined that
(B ∩ C) ∪ (C ∩ A)  C ∩ (A ∩ C) ∩ B .

Functions

A function is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. We call the
output the image of the input. The set of all inputs for a function is called
the domain. The set of all allowable outputs is called the codomain. We
would write f : X → Y to describe a function with name f , domain X and
codomain Y. This does not tell us which function f is though. To define
the function, we must describe the rule. This is often done by giving a
formula to compute the output for any input (although this is certainly
not the only way to describe the rule).
For example, consider the function f : N → N defined by f (x)  x 2 +3.
Here the domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers).
The rule is: take your input, multiply it by itself and add 3. This works
because we can apply this rule to every natural number (every element of
the domain) and the result is always a natural number (an element of the
codomain). Notice though that not every natural number is actually an
output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.). The set of natural numbers
that are outputs is called the range of the function (in this case, the range
is {3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, . . .}, all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a
perfect square).
The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one
output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule.
What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer
for any particular function.
Example 0.4.1

The following are all examples of functions:
1. f : Z → Z defined by f (n)  3n. The domain and codomain
are both the set of integers. However, the range is only the
set of integer multiples of 3.
2. g : {1, 2, 3} → {a, b, c} defined by g(1)  c, g(2)  a and
g(3)  a. The domain is the set {1, 2, 3}, the codomain is the
set {a, b, c} and the range is the set {a, c}. Note that g(2) and
g(3) are the same element of the codomain. This is okay since
each element in the domain still has only one output.
3. h : {1, 2, 3, 4} → N defined by the table:
x

Here the domain is the finite set {1, 2, 3, 4} and to codomain
is the set of natural numbers, N. At first you might think this

40

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

function is the same as f defined above. It is absolutely not.
Even though the rule is the same, the domain and codomain
are different, so these are two different functions.
Example 0.4.2

Just because you can describe a rule in the same way you would
write a function, does not mean that the rule is a function. The
following are NOT functions.
1. f : N → N defined by f (n)  n2 . The reason this is not a
function is because not every input has an output. Where
does f send 3? The rule says that f (3)  23 , but 32 is not an
element of the codomain.
2. Consider the rule that matches each person to their phone
number. If you think of the set of people as the domain
and the set of phone numbers as the codomain, then this is
not a function, since some people have two phone numbers.
Switching the domain and codomain sets doesn’t help either,
since some phone numbers belong to multiple people (assuming some households still have landlines when you are
reading this).

Describing Functions
It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description.
The function is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists
whether or not anyone ever talks about it. But when we do want to talk
about the function, we need a way to describe it. A particular function
can be described in multiple ways.
Some calculus textbooks talk about the Rule of Four, that every function
can be described in four ways: algebraically (a formula), numerically (a
table), graphically, or in words. In discrete math, we can still use any of
these to describe functions, but we can also be more specific since we are
primarily concerned with functions that have N or a finite subset of N as
their domain.
Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of
the function: plotting the points on the plain. We can do this, and might
get a graph like the following for a function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}.

0.4. Functions

41

It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them
to some curve. There are only three elements in the domain. A curve
would mean that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.
Here is another way to represent that same function:
1

2

3

1

2

3

This shows that the function f sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3: just
follow the arrows.
The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very
helpful in visualizing functions. We will often be working with functions
with finite domains, so this kind of picture is often more useful than a
traditional graph of a function.
Note that for finite domains, finding an algebraic formula that gives
the output for any input is often impossible. Of course we could use a
piecewise defined function, like




x+1




if x  1




x


if x  3

f (x)  x − 1

if x  2 .

This describes exactly the same function as above, but we can all agree is
a ridiculous way of doing so.
Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains,
let’s adopt some notation to describe them. All we need is some clear way
of denoting the image of each element in the domain. In fact, writing a
table of values would work perfectly:
0
3

x
f (x)

1
3

2
2

3
4

1

We simplify this further by writing this as a matrix with each input
directly over its output:
0 1 2 3 4
f 
.
3 3 2 4 1





42

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find
in a linear algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with
these matrices, or row reduce them, for example).
One advantage of the two-line notation over the arrow diagrams is
that it is harder to accidentally define a rule that is not a function using
two-line notation.
Example 0.4.3

Which of the following diagrams represent a function? Let X 
{1, 2, 3, 4} and Y  {a, b, c, d}.

h:X→Y

Solution. f is a function. So is g. There is no problem with an
element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and
there is no problem with a from the codomain being the image of
both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation
to write these as
1 2 3 4
f 
d a c b





1 2 3 4
.
g
d a a b





However, h is NOT a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons.
First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain
has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (a
and c). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a
rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings
are functions:

It might also be helpful to think about how you would write
the two-line notation for h. We would have something like:
h



1

2
3 4
.
a, c? d b



There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than
one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function,
the two-line notation will always “work”.

0.4. Functions

43

We will also be interested in functions with domain N. Here twoline notation is no good, but describing the function algebraically is often
possible. Even tables are a little awkward, since they do not describe the
function completely. For example, consider the function f : N → N given
by the table below.

Have I given you enough entries for you to be able to determine f (6)?
You might guess that f (6)  36, but there is no way for you to know this for
sure. Maybe I am being a jerk and intended f (6)  42. In fact, for every
natural number n, there is a function that agrees with the table above, but
for which f (6)  n.
Okay, suppose I really did mean for f (6)  36, and in fact, for the
rule that you think is governing the function to actually be the rule. Then
I should say what that rule is. f (n)  n 2 . Now there is no confusion
possible.
Giving an explicit formula that calculates the image of any element in
the domain is a great way to describe a function. We will say that these
explicit rules are closed formulas for the function.
There is another very useful way to describe functions whose domain
is N, that rely specifically on the structure of the natural numbers. We can
define a function recursively!
Example 0.4.4

Consider the function f : N → N given by f (0)  0 and f (n + 1) 
f (n) + 2n + 1. Find f (6).
Solution. The rule says that f (6)  f (5) + 11 (we are using 6  n + 1
so n  5). We don’t know what f (5) is though. Well, we know that
f (5)  f (4) + 9. So we need to compute f (4), which will require
knowing f (3), which will require f (2),. . . will it ever end?
Yes! In fact, this process will always end because we have N as
our domain, so there is a least element. And we gave the value of
f (0) explicitly, so we are good. In fact, we might decide to work up
to f (6) instead of working down from f (6):
f (1)  f (0) + 1 

0+11

f (2)  f (1) + 3 

1+34

f (3)  f (2) + 5 

16 + 9  25

It looks that this recursively defined function is the same as the
explicitly defined function f (n)  n 2 . Is it? Later we will prove
that it is.
Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a “real
world” problem, because they describe how the values of the functions
are changing. However, this comes with a price. It is harder to calculate
the image of a single input, since you need to know the images of other
(previous) elements in the domain.
Recursively Defined Functions.
For a function f : N → N, a recursive definition consists of an
initial condition together with a recurrence relation. The initial
condition is the explicitly given value of f (0). The recurrence relation is a formula for f (n + 1) in terms for f (n) (and possibly n
itself).
Example 0.4.5

Give recursive definitions for the functions described below.
1. f : N → N gives the number of snails in your terrarium n
years after you built it, assuming you started with 3 snails
and the number of snails doubles each year.
2. g : N → N gives the number of push-ups you do n days after
you started your push-ups challenge, assuming you could do
7 push-ups on day 0 and you can do 2 more push-ups each
day.
3. h : N → N defined by f (n)  n!. Recall that n!  1 · 2 · 3 · · · · ·
(n − 1) · n is the product of all numbers from 1 through n. We
also define 0!  1.
Solution.
1. The initial condition is f (0)  3. To get f (n + 1) we would
double the number of snails in the terrarium the previous
year, which is given by f (n). Thus f (n + 1)  2 f (n). The
full recursive definition contains both of these, and would be
written,
f (0)  3; f (n + 1)  2 f (n).

0.4. Functions

45

2. We are told that on day 0 you can do 7 push-ups, so f (0)  7.
The number of push-ups you can do on day n + 1 is 2 more
than the number you can do on day n, which is given by f (n).
Thus
f (0)  7; f (n + 1)  f (n) + 2.
3. Here f (0)  1. To get the recurrence relation, think about
how you can get f (n + 1)  (n + 1)! from f (n)  n!. If you
write out both of these as products, you see that (n + 1)! is
just like n! except you have one more term in the product, an
extra n + 1. So we have,
f (0)  1; f (n + 1)  (n + 1) · f (n).

Surjections, Injections, and Bijections
We now turn to investigating special properties functions might or might
not possess.
In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there
are elements of the codomain which are not in the range. When this sort
of the thing does not happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain
is in the range) we say the function is onto or that the function maps the
domain onto the codomain. This terminology should make sense: the
function puts the domain (entirely) on top of the codomain. The fancy
math term for an onto function is a surjection, and we say that an onto
function is a surjective function.

Solution.
1. f is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which
are not in the range. For example, no n ∈ Z gets mapped to
the number 1 (the rule would say that 31 would be sent to 1,
but 13 is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function
is 3Z (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to Z.
2. g is not surjective. There is no x ∈ {1, 2, 3} (the domain) for
which g(x)  b, so b, which is in the codomain, is not in the
range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain
“missing” from the bottom row of the matrix.
3. h is surjective. Every element of the codomain is also in the
range. Nothing in the codomain is missed.
To be a function, a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to
two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen
that the reverse is permissible: a function might assign the same element
of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When
this does not occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is the
image of at most one element of the domain) then we say the function
is one-to-one. Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at
most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain.
One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function
is an injection. We call one-to-one functions injective functions.
In pictures:

Solution.
1. f is injective. Each element in the codomain is assigned to at
most one element from the domain. If x is a multiple of three,
then only x/3 is mapped to x. If x is not a multiple of 3, then
there is no input corresponding to the output x.
2. g is not injective. Both inputs 2 and 3 are assigned the output
a. Notice that there is an element from the codomain that
appears more than once on the bottom row of the matrix.
3. h is injective. Each output is only an output once.
Be careful: “surjective” and “injective” are NOT opposites. You can
see in the two examples above that there are functions which are surjective
but not injective, injective but not surjective, both, or neither. In the case
when a function is both one-to-one and onto (an injection and surjection),
we say the function is a bĳection, or that the function is a bĳective
function.
To illustrate the contrast between these two properties, consider a
more formal definition of each, side by side.
Injective vs Surjective.
A function is injective provided every element of the codomain is
the image of at most one element from the domain.
A function is surjective provided every element of the codomain
is the image of at least one element from the domain.
Notice both properties are determined by what happens to elements of
the codomain: they could be repeated as images or they could be “missed”
(not be images). Injective functions do not have repeats but might or might
not miss elements. Surjective functions do not miss elements, but might

48

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

or might not have repeats. The bĳective functions are those that do not
have repeats and do not miss elements.

Image and Inverse Image
When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element
of the domain (say x) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we
write f (x), which is the image of x). Sometimes we will want to talk about
all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain. It would
also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say y) and talk
about which element or elements (if any) from the domain it is the image
of. We could write “those x in the domain such that f (x)  y,” but this is
a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.
To address the first situation, what we are after is a way to describe
the set of images of elements in some subset of the domain. Suppose
f : X → Y is a function and that A ⊆ X is some subset of the domain
(possibly all of it). We will use the notation f (A) to denote the image of
A under f , namely the set of elements in Y that are the image of elements
from A. That is, f (A)  { f (a) ∈ Y : a ∈ A}.
We can do this in the other direction as well. We might ask which
elements of the domain get mapped to a particular set in the codomain.
Let f : X → Y be a function and suppose B ⊆ Y is a subset of the
codomain. Then we will write f −1 (B) for the inverse image of B under f ,
namely the set of elements in X whose image are elements in B. In other
words, f −1 (B)  {x ∈ X : f (x) ∈ B}.
Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular
element y of in the codomain. The notation above works: f −1 ({ y}) is the
set of all elements in the domain that f sends to y. It makes sense to think
of this as a set: there might not be anything sent to y (if y is not in the
range), in which case f −1 ({ y})  ∅. Or f might send multiple elements
to y (if f is not injective). As a notational convenience, we usually drop
the set braces around the y and write f inf(y) instead for this set.
WARNING: f −1 (y) is not an inverse function! Inverse functions only
exist for bĳections, but f −1 (y) is defined for any function f . The point:
f −1 (y) is a set, not an element of the domain. This is just sloppy notation
for f −1 ({ y}). To help make this distinction, we would call f −1 (y) the
complete inverse image of y under f . It is not the image of y under f −1
(since the function f −1 might not exist).

codomain to which f sends 1 and 2.
f inf({a, b})  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} since these are exactly the elements
that f sends to a and b.
f inf(d)  ∅ since d is not in the range of f .
Example 0.4.9

Consider the function g : Z → Z defined by g(n)  n 2 + 1. Find
g(1) and g({1}). Then find g −1 (1), g −1 (2), and g −1 (3).
Solution. Note that g(1) , g({1}). The first is an element: g(1)  2.
The second is a set: g({1})  {2}.
To find g −1 (1), we need to find all integers n such that n 2 +1  1.
Clearly only 0 works, so g −1 (1)  {0} (note that even though there
is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).
To find g −1 (2), we need to find all n such that n 2 + 1  2. We
see g −1 (2)  {−1, 1}.
Finally, if n 2 + 1  3, then we are looking for an n such that
n 2  2. There are no such integers so g −1 (3)  ∅.
Since f −1 (y) is a set, it makes sense to ask for f −1 (y) , the number of
elements in the domain which map to y.
Example 0.4.10

Find a function f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → N such that f −1 (7)  5.
Solution. There is only one such function. We need five elements
of the domain to map to the number 7 ∈ N. Since there are only
five elements in the domain, all of them must map to 7. So

Function Definitions.
Here is a summary of all the main concepts and definitions we use when
working with functions.
• A function is a rule that assigns each element of a set, called the
domain, to exactly one element of a second set, called the codomain.
• Notation: f : X → Y is our way of saying that the function is called
f , the domain is the set X, and the codomain is the set Y.
• To specify the rule for a function with small domain, use two-line
notation by writing a matrix with each output directly below its
corresponding input, as in:
1 2 3 4
.
f 
2 1 3 1





• f (x)  y means the element x of the domain (input) is assigned to
the element y of the codomain. We say y is an output. Alternatively,
we call y the image of x under f .
• The range is a subset of the codomain. It is the set of all elements
which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the
function. That is, the range is the set of all outputs.
• A function is injective (an injection or one-to-one) if every element
of the codomain is the image of at most one element from the
domain.
• A function is surjective (a surjection or onto) if every element of
the codomain is the image of at least one element from the domain.
• A bĳection is a function which is both an injection and surjection.
In other words, if every element of the codomain is the image of
exactly one element from the domain.
• The image of an element x in the domain is the element y in the
codomain that x is mapped to. That is, the image of x under f is
f (x).
• The complete inverse image of an element y in the codomain, written f −1 (y), is the set of all elements in the domain which are assigned
to y by the function.
• The image of a subset A of the domain is the set f (A)  { f (a) ∈ Y :
a ∈ A}.
• The inverse image of a a subset B of the codomain is the set f −1 (B) 
{x ∈ X : f (x) ∈ B}.

Counting
One of the first things you learn in mathematics is how to count. Now
we want to count large collections of things quickly and precisely. For
example:
• In a group of 10 people, if everyone shakes hands with everyone
else exactly once, how many handshakes took place?
• How many ways can you distribute 10 girl scout cookies to 7 boy
scouts?
• How many anagrams are there of “anagram”?
Before tackling questions like these, let’s look at the basics of counting.

1.1

Additive and Multiplicative Principles

Investigate!
1. A restaurant offers 8 appetizers and 14 entrées. How many
choices do you have if:
(a) you will eat one dish, either an appetizer or an entrée?
(b) you are extra hungry and want to eat both an appetizer
and an entrée?
2. Think about the methods you used to solve question 1. Write
down the rules for these methods.
3. Do your rules work? A standard deck of playing cards has
26 red cards and 12 face cards.
(a) How many ways can you select a card which is either
red or a face card?
(b) How many ways can you select a card which is both
red and a face card?
(c) How many ways can you select two cards so that the
first one is red and the second one is a face card?

1. Counting

Consider this rather simple counting problem: at Red Dogs and
Donuts, there are 14 varieties of donuts, and 16 types of hot dogs. If
you want either a donut or a dog, how many options do you have? This
isn’t too hard, just add 14 and 16. Will that always work? What is important here?
Additive Principle.
The additive principle states that if event A can occur in m ways,
and event B can occur in n disjoint ways, then the event “A or B”
can occur in m + n ways.
It is important that the events be disjoint: i.e., that there is no way for
A and B to both happen at the same time. For example, a standard deck of
52 cards contains 26 red cards and 12 face cards. However, the number of
ways to select a card which is either red or a face card is not 26 + 12  38.
This is because there are 6 cards which are both red and face cards.
Example 1.1.1

How many two letter “words” start with either A or B? (A word
is just a string of letters; it doesn’t have to be English, or even
pronounceable.)
Solution. First, how many two letter words start with A? We just
need to select the second letter, which can be accomplished in 26
ways. So there are 26 words starting with A. There are also 26
words that start with B. To select a word which starts with either A
or B, we can pick the word from the first 26 or the second 26, for a
total of 52 words.
The additive principle also works with more than two events. Say, in
addition to your 14 choices for donuts and 16 for dogs, you would also
consider eating one of 15 waffles? How many choices do you have now?
You would have 14 + 16 + 15  45 options.
Example 1.1.2

How many two letter words start with one of the 5 vowels?
Solution. There are 26 two letter words starting with A, another 26
starting with E, and so on. We will have 5 groups of 26. So we add
26 to itself 5 times. Of course it would be easier to just multiply
5 · 26. We are really using the additive principle again, just using
multiplication as a shortcut.

1.1. Additive and Multiplicative Principles

59

Example 1.1.3

Suppose you are going for some fro-yo. You can pick one of 6
yogurt choices, and one of 4 toppings. How many choices do you
have?
Solution. Break your choices up into disjoint events: A are the
choices with the first topping, B the choices featuring the second
topping, and so on. There are four events; each can occur in 6 ways
(one for each yogurt flavor). The events are disjoint, so the total
number of choices is 6 + 6 + 6 + 6  24.
Note that in both of the previous examples, when using the additive
principle on a bunch of events all the same size, it is quicker to multiply.
This really is the same, and not just because 6 + 6 + 6 + 6  4 · 6. We
can first select the topping in 4 ways (that is, we first select which of the
disjoint events we will take). For each of those first 4 choices, we now
have 6 choices of yogurt. We have:
Multiplicative Principle.
The multiplicative principle states that if event A can occur in m
ways, and each possibility for A allows for exactly n ways for event
B, then the event “A and B” can occur in m · n ways.
The multiplicative principle generalizes to more than two events as
well.
Example 1.1.4

How many license plates can you make out of three letters followed
by three numerical digits?
Solution. Here we have six events: the first letter, the second letter,
the third letter, the first digit, the second digit, and the third digit.
The first three events can each happen in 26 ways; the last three can
each happen in 10 ways. So the total number of license plates will
be 26 · 26 · 26 · 10 · 10 · 10, using the multiplicative principle.
Does this make sense? Think about how we would pick a
license plate. How many choices we would have? First, we need
to pick the first letter. There are 26 choices. Now for each of those,
there are 26 choices for the second letter: 26 second letters with first
letter A, 26 second letters with first letter B, and so on. We add 26

60

1. Counting

to itself 26 times. Or quicker: there are 26 · 26 choices for the first
two letters.
Now for each choice of the first two letters, we have 26 choices
for the third letter. That is, 26 third letters for the first two letters
AA, 26 choices for the third letter after starting AB, and so on. There
are 26 · 26 of these 26 third letter choices, for a total of (26 · 26) · 26
choices for the first three letters. And for each of these 26 · 26 · 26
choices of letters, we have a bunch of choices for the remaining
digits.
In fact, there are going to be exactly 1000 choices for the numbers. We can see this because there are 1000 three-digit numbers
(000 through 999). This is 10 choices for the first digit, 10 for the
second, and 10 for the third. The multiplicative principle says we
multiply: 10 · 10 · 10  1000.
All together, there were 263 choices for the three letters, and 103
choices for the numbers, so we have a total of 263 · 103 choices of
license plates.
Careful: “and” doesn’t mean “times.” For example, how many playing
cards are both red and a face card? Not 26 · 12. The answer is 6, and we
needed to know something about cards to answer that question.
Another caution: how many ways can you select two cards, so that the
first one is a red card and the second one is a face card? This looks more
like the multiplicative principle (you are counting two separate events)
but the answer is not 26 · 12 here either. The problem is that while there
are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the case that for each of
those there are 12 ways to select the second card. If the first card was both
red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second
card.1
Example 1.1.5 Counting functions.

How many functions f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → {a, b, c, d} are there?
Solution. Remember that a function sends each element of the
domain to exactly one element of the codomain. To determine a
function, we just need to specify the image of each element in the
domain. Where can we send 1? There are 4 choices. Where can we
send 2? Again, 4 choices. What we have here is 5 “events” (picking
1To solve this problem, you could break it into two cases. First, count how many ways
there are to select the two cards when the first card is a red non-face card. Second, count
how many ways when the first card is a red face card. Doing so makes the events in each
separate case independent, so the multiplicative principle can be applied.

1.1. Additive and Multiplicative Principles

61

the image of an element in the domain) each of which can happen
in 4 ways (the choices for that image). Thus there are 4·4·4·4·4  45
functions.
This is more than just an example of how we can use the multiplicative principle in a particular counting question. What we have
here is a general interpretation of certain applications of the multiplicative principle using rigorously defined mathematical objects:
functions. Whenever we have a counting question that asks for the
the number of outcomes of a repeated event, we can interpret that
as asking for the number of functions from {1, 2, . . . , n} (where n
is the number of times the event is repeated) to {1, 2, . . . , k} (where
k is the number of ways that event can occur).

Counting With Sets
Do you believe the additive and multiplicative principles? How would
you convince someone they are correct? This is surprisingly difficult.
They seem so simple, so obvious. But why do they work?
To make things clearer, and more mathematically rigorous, we will
use sets. Do not skip this section! It might seem like we are just trying
to give a proof of these principles, but we are doing a lot more. If we
understand the additive and multiplicative principles rigorously, we will
be better at applying them, and knowing when and when not to apply
them at all.
We will look at the additive and multiplicative principles in a slightly
different way. Instead of thinking about event A and event B, we want to
think of a set A and a set B. The sets will contain all the different ways
the event can happen. (It will be helpful to be able to switch back and
forth between these two models when checking that we have counted
correctly.) Here’s what we mean:
Example 1.1.6

Suppose you own 9 shirts and 5 pairs of pants.
1. How many outfits can you make?
2. If today is half-naked-day, and you will wear only a shirt or
only a pair of pants, how many choices do you have?
Solution. By now you should agree that the answer to the first
question is 9 · 5  45 and the answer to the second question is
9 + 5  14. These are the multiplicative and additive principles.

62

1. Counting

There are two events: picking a shirt and picking a pair of pants.
The first event can happen in 9 ways and the second event can
happen in 5 ways. To get both a shirt and a pair of pants, you
multiply. To get just one article of clothing, you add.
Now look at this using sets. There are two sets, call them S and
P. The set S contains all 9 shirts so |S|  9 while |P|  5, since there
are 5 elements in the set P (namely your 5 pairs of pants). What are
we asking in terms of these sets? Well in question 2, we really want
|S ∪ P|, the number of elements in the union of shirts and pants.
This is just |S| + |P| (since there is no overlap; |S ∩ P|  0). Question
1 is slightly more complicated. Your first guess might be to find
|S ∩ P|, but this is not right (there is nothing in the intersection). We
are not asking for how many clothing items are both a shirt and a
pair of pants. Instead, we want one of each. We could think of this
as asking how many pairs (x, y) there are, where x is a shirt and y
is a pair of pants. As we will soon verify, this number is |S| · |P|.
From this example we can see right away how to rephrase our additive
principle in terms of sets:
Additive Principle (with sets).
Given two sets A and B, if A ∩ B  ∅ (that is, if there is no element
in common to both A and B), then
|A ∪ B|  |A| + |B| .
This hardly needs a proof. To find A ∪ B, you take everything in A and
throw in everything in B. Since there is no element in both sets already,
you will have |A| things and add |B| new things to it. This is what adding
does! Of course, we can easily extend this to any number of disjoint sets.
From the example above, we see that in order to investigate the multiplicative principle carefully, we need to consider ordered pairs. We
should define this carefully:
Cartesian Product.
Given sets A and B, we can form the set
A × B  {(x, y) : x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ B}
to be the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) where x is an element of A
and y is an element of B. We call A × B the Cartesian product of A
and B.

1.1. Additive and Multiplicative Principles

63

Example 1.1.7

Let A  {1, 2} and B  {3, 4, 5}. Find A × B.
Solution. We want to find ordered pairs (a, b) where a can be either
1 or 2 and b can be either 3, 4, or 5. A × B is the set of all of these
pairs:
A × B  {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}.
The question is, what is |A × B|? To figure this out, write out A × B.
Let A  {a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . . , a m } and B  {b1 , b2 , b3 , . . . , b n } (so |A|  m and
|B|  n). The set A × B contains all pairs with the first half of the pair
being some a i ∈ A and the second being one of the b j ∈ B. In other words:
A × B  {(a1 , b1 ), (a 1 , b2 ), (a 1 , b3 ), . . . (a 1 , b n ),
(a2 , b1 ), (a 2 , b2 ), (a 2 , b 3 ), . . . , (a 2 , b n ),
(a 3 , b1 ), (a 3 , b2 ), (a 3 , b 3 ), . . . , (a 3 , b n ),
..
.
(a m , b1 ), (a m , b2 ), (a m , b 3 ), . . . , (a m , b n )}.
Notice what we have done here: we made m rows of n pairs, for a total
of m · n pairs.
Each row above is really {a i } × B for some a i ∈ A. That is, we fixed the
A-element. Broken up this way, we have
A × B  ({a 1 } × B) ∪ ({a 2 } × B) ∪ ({a 3 } × B) ∪ · · · ∪ ({a m } × B).
So A × B is really the union of m disjoint sets. Each of those sets has
n elements in them. The total (using the additive principle) is n + n + n +
· · · + n  m · n.
To summarize:
Multiplicative Principle (with sets).
Given two sets A and B, we have |A × B|  |A| · |B|.
Again, we can easily extend this to any number of sets.

While we are thinking about sets, consider what happens to the additive principle when the sets are NOT disjoint. Suppose we want to find
|A ∪ B| and know that |A|  10 and |B|  8. This is not enough information though. We do not know how many of the 8 elements in B are also
elements of A. However, if we also know that |A ∩ B|  6, then we can
say exactly how many elements are in A, and, of those, how many are in
B and how many are not (6 of the 10 elements are in B, so 4 are in A but
not in B). We could fill in a Venn diagram as follows:

A

B
4

6

2

This says there are 6 elements in A ∩ B, 4 elements in A \ B and
2 elements in B \ A. Now these three sets are disjoint, so we can use
the additive principle to find the number of elements in A ∪ B. It is
6 + 4 + 2  12.
This will always work, but drawing a Venn diagram is more than we
need to do. In fact, it would be nice to relate this problem to the case
where A and B are disjoint. Is there one rule we can make that works in
either case?
Here is another way to get the answer to the problem above. Start by
just adding |A| + |B|. This is 10 + 8  18, which would be the answer if
|A ∩ B|  0. We see that we are off by exactly 6, which just so happens to

1.1. Additive and Multiplicative Principles

65

be |A ∩ B|. So perhaps we guess,
|A ∪ B|  |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B| .
This works for this one example. Will it always work? Think about
what we are doing here. We want to know how many things are either in
A or B (or both). We can throw in everything in A, and everything in B.
This would give |A| + |B| many elements. But of course when you actually
take the union, you do not repeat elements that are in both. So far we
have counted every element in A ∩ B exactly twice: once when we put in
the elements from A and once when we included the elements from B.
We correct by subtracting out the number of elements we have counted
twice. So we added them in twice, subtracted once, leaving them counted
only one time.
In other words, we have:
Cardinality of a union (2 sets).
For any finite sets A and B,
|A ∪ B|  |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B| .
We can do something similar with three sets.
Example 1.1.8

An examination in three subjects, Algebra, Biology, and Chemistry,
was taken by 41 students. The following table shows how many
students failed in each single subject and in their various combinations:
Subject: A B C AB AC BC ABC
Failed: 12 5 8
2
6
3
1
How many students failed at least one subject?
Solution. The answer is not 37, even though the sum of the numbers above is 37. For example, while 12 students failed Algebra, 2
of those students also failed Biology, 6 also failed Chemestry, and
1 of those failed all three subjects. In fact, that 1 student who failed
all three subjects is counted a total of 7 times in the total 37. To
clarify things, let us think of the students who failed Algebra as
the elements of the set A, and similarly for sets B and C. The one
student who failed all three subjects is the lone element of the set
A ∩ B ∩ C. Thus, in Venn diagrams:

66

1. Counting

A

B
1

C

Now let’s fill in the other intersections. We know A ∩ B contains
2 elements, but 1 element has already been counted. So we should
put a 1 in the region where A and B intersect (but C does not).
Similarly, we calculate the cardinality of (A ∩ C) \ B, and (B ∩ C) \ A:
A

B

1
5

1

2
C

Next, we determine the numbers which should go in the remaining regions, including outside of all three circles. This last
number is the number of students who did not fail any subject:
A
5
26

B

1

5

1

1
2

0
C

We found 5 goes in the “A only” region because the entire circle
for A needed to have a total of 12, and 7 were already accounted
for. Similarly, we calculate the “B only” region to contain only 1
student and the “C only” region to contain no students.
Thus the number of students who failed at least one class is 15
(the sum of the numbers in each of the eight disjoint regions). The
number of students who passed all three classes is 26: the total
number of students, 41, less the 15 who failed at least one class.
Note that we can also answer other questions. For example, how
many students failed just Chemistry? None. How many passed
Algebra but failed both Biology and Chemistry? This corresponds
to the region inside both B and C but outside of A, containing 2
students.
Could we have solved the problem above in an algebraic way? While
the additive principle generalizes to any number of sets, when we add a
third set here, we must be careful. With two sets, we needed to know the

1.1. Additive and Multiplicative Principles

67

cardinalities of A, B, and A ∩ B in order to find the cardinality of A ∪ B.
With three sets we need more information. There are more ways the sets
can combine. Not surprisingly then, the formula for cardinality of the
union of three non-disjoint sets is more complicated:
Cardinality of a union (3 sets).
For any finite sets A, B, and C,
|A ∪ B ∪ C|  |A|+|B|+|C|−|A ∩ B|−|A ∩ C|−|B ∩ C|+|A ∩ B ∩ C| .
To determine how many elements are in at least one of A, B, or C we
add up all the elements in each of those sets. However, when we do that,
any element in both A and B is counted twice. Also, each element in both
A and C is counted twice, as are elements in B and C, so we take each of
those out of our sum once. But now what about the elements which are
in A ∩ B ∩ C (in all three sets)? We added them in three times, but also
removed them three times. They have not yet been counted. Thus we add
those elements back in at the end.
Returning to our example above, we have |A|  12, |B|  5, |C|  8.
We also have |A ∩ B|  2, |A ∩ C|  6, |B ∩ C|  3, and |A ∩ B ∩ C|  1.
Therefore:
|A ∪ B ∪ C|  12 + 5 + 8 − 2 − 6 − 3 + 1  15.
This is what we got when we solved the problem using Venn diagrams.
This process of adding in, then taking out, then adding back in, and
so on is called the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion, or simply PIE. We will
return to this counting technique later to solve for more complicated
problems (involving more than 3 sets).

Investigate!
In chess, a rook can move only in straight lines (not diagonally).
Fill in each square of the chess board below with the number of
different shortest paths the rook, in the upper left corner, can take
to get to that square. For example, one square is already filled
in. There are six different paths from the rook to the square:
DDRR (down down right right), DRDR, DRRD, RDDR, RDRD
and RRDD.

Here are some apparently different discrete objects we can count:
subsets, bit strings, lattice paths, and binomial coefficients. We will give
an example of each type of counting problem (and say what these things
even are). As we will see, these counting problems are surprisingly
similar.

Subsets
Subsets should be familiar, otherwise read over Section 0.3 again. Suppose
we look at the set A  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. How many subsets of A contain
exactly 3 elements?
First, a simpler question: How many subsets of A are there total? In
other words, what is |P(A)| (the cardinality of the power set of A)? Think
about how we would build a subset. We need to decide, for each of the
elements of A, whether or not to include the element in our subset. So
we need to decide “yes” or “no” for the element 1. And for each choice
we make, we need to decide “yes” or “no” for the element 2. And so on.

1.2. Binomial Coefficients

71

For each of the 5 elements, we have 2 choices. Therefore the number of
subsets is simply 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2  25 (by the multiplicative principle).
Of those 32 subsets, how many have 3 elements? This is not obvious.
Note that we cannot just use the multiplicative principle. Maybe we want
to say we have 2 choices (yes/no) for the first element, 2 choices for the
second, 2 choices for the third, and then only 1 choice for the other two.
But what if we said “no” to one of the first three elements? Then we
would have two choices for the 4th element. What a mess!
Another (bad) idea: we need to pick three elements to be in our subset.
There are 5 elements to choose from. So there are 5 choices for the first
element, and for each of those 4 choices for the second, and then 3 for
the third (last) element. The multiplicative principle would say then that
there are a total of 5 · 4 · 3  60 ways to select the 3-element subset. But this
cannot be correct (60 > 32 for one thing). One of the outcomes we would
get from these choices would be the set {3, 2, 5}, by choosing the element
3 first, then the element 2, then the element 5. Another outcome would
be {5, 2, 3} by choosing the element 5 first, then the element 2, then the
element 3. But these are the same set! We can correct this by dividing:
for each set of three elements, there are 6 outcomes counted among our
60 (since there are 3 choices for which element we list first, 2 for which
we list second, and 1 for which we list last). So we expect there to be 10
3-element subsets of A.
Is this right? Well, we could list out all 10 of them, being very systematic in doing so, to make sure we don’t miss any or list any twice. Or we
could try to count how many subsets of A don’t have 3 elements in them.
How many have no elements? Just 1 (the empty set). How many have 5?
Again, just 1. These are the cases in which we say “no” to all elements,
or “yes” to all elements. Okay, what about the subsets which contain a
single element? There are 5 of these. We must say “yes” to exactly one
element, and there are 5 to choose from. This is also the number of subsets
containing 4 elements. Those are the ones for which we must say “no” to
exactly one element.
So far we have counted 12 of the 32 subsets. We have not yet counted
the subsets with cardinality 2 and with cardinality 3. There are a total of
20 subsets left to split up between these two groups. But the number of
each must be the same! If we say “yes” to exactly two elements, that can be
accomplished in exactly the same number of ways as the number of ways
we can say “no” to exactly two elements. So the number of 2-element
subsets is equal to the number of 3-element subsets. Together there are
20 of these subsets, so 10 each.

1. Counting

Bit Strings
“Bit” is short for “binary digit,” so a bit string is a string of binary digits.
The binary digits are simply the numbers 0 and 1. All of the following
are bit strings:
1001 0 1111 1010101010.
The number of bits (0’s or 1’s) in the string is the length of the string;
the strings above have lengths 4, 1, 4, and 10 respectively. We also can
ask how many of the bits are 1’s. The number of 1’s in a bit string is the
weight of the string; the weights of the above strings are 2, 0, 4, and 5
respectively.
Bit Strings.
• An n-bit string is a bit string of length n. That is, it is a string
containing n symbols, each of which is a bit, either 0 or 1.
• The weight of a bit string is the number of 1’s in it.
• Bn is the set of all n-bit strings.
• Bnk is the set of all n-bit strings of weight k.
For example, the elements of the set B32 are the bit strings 011, 101, and
110. Those are the only strings containing three bits exactly two of which
are 1’s.
The counting questions: How many bit strings have length 5? How
many of those have weight 3? In other words, we are asking for the
cardinalities |B5 | and |B53 |.
To find the number of 5-bit strings is straight forward. We have 5 bits,
and each can either be a 0 or a 1. So there are 2 choices for the first bit, 2
choices for the second, and so on. By the multiplicative principle, there
are 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2  25  32 such strings.
Finding the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3 is harder. Think about
how such a string could start. The first bit must be either a 0 or a 1. In the
first case (the string starts with a 0), we must then decide on four more
bits. To have a total of three 1’s, among those four remaining bits there
must be three 1’s. To count all of these strings, we must include all 4-bit
strings of weight 3. In the second case (the string starts with a 1), we
still have four bits to choose, but now only two of them can be 1’s, so we
should look at all the 4-bit strings of weight 2. So the strings in B53 all have
the form 1B42 (that is, a 1 followed by a string from B42 ) or 0B43 . These two
sets are disjoint, so we can use the additive principle:
|B53 |  |B42 | + |B43 |.

1.2. Binomial Coefficients

73

This is an example of a recurrence relation. We represented one
instance of our counting problem in terms of two simpler instances of the
problem. If only we knew the cardinalities of B42 and B43 . Repeating the
same reasoning,
|B42 |  |B31 | + |B32 |

and

|B43 |  |B32 | + |B33 |.

We can keep going down, but this should be good enough. Both B31
and B32 contain 3 bit strings: we must pick one of the three bits to be a 1
(three ways to do that) or one of the three bits to be a 0 (three ways to do
that). Also, B33 contains just one string: 111. Thus |B42 |  6 and |B43 |  4,
which puts B53 at a total of 10 strings.
But wait —32 and 10 were the answers to the counting questions about
subsets. Coincidence? Not at all. Each bit string can be thought of as a
code for a subset. To represent the subsets of A  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we can
use 5-bit strings, one bit for each element of A. Each bit in the string is
a 0 if its corresponding element of A is not in the subset, and a 1 if the
element of A is in the subset. Remember, deciding the subset amounted
to a sequence of five yes/no votes for the elements of A. Instead of yes,
we put a 1; instead of no, we put a 0.
For example, the bit string 11001 represents the subset {1, 2, 5} since
the first, second and fifth bits are 1’s. The subset {3, 5} would be coded
by the string 00101. What we really have here is a bĳection from P(A) to
B5 .
Now for a subset to contain exactly three elements, the corresponding
bit string must contain exactly three 1’s. In other words, the weight must
be 3. Thus counting the number of 3-element subsets of A is the same as
counting the number 5-bit strings of weight 3.

Lattice Paths
The integer lattice is the set of all points in the Cartesian plane for which
both the x and y coordinates are integers. If you like to draw graphs on
graph paper, the lattice is the set of all the intersections of the grid lines.
A lattice path is one of the shortest possible paths connecting two
points on the lattice, moving only horizontally and vertically. For example, here are three possible lattice paths from the points (0, 0) to (3, 2):
(3,2)

(0,0)

(3,2)

(0,0)

(3,2)

(0,0)

Notice to ensure the path is the shortest possible, each move must be
either to the right or up. Additionally, in this case, note that no matter

74

1. Counting

what path we take, we must make three steps right and two steps up. No
matter what order we make these steps, there will always be 5 steps. Thus
each path has length 5.
The counting question: how many lattice paths are there between
(0, 0) and (3, 2)? We could try to draw all of these, or instead of drawing
them, maybe just list which direction we travel on each of the 5 steps.
One path might be RRUUR, or maybe UURRR, or perhaps RURRU (those
correspond to the three paths drawn above). So how many such strings
of R’s and U’s are there?
Notice that each of these strings must contain 5 symbols. Exactly 3 of
them must be R’s (since our destination is 3 units to the right). This seems
awfully familiar. In fact, what if we used 1’s instead of R’s and 0’s instead
of U’s? Then we would just have 5-bit strings of weight 3. There are 10 of
those, so there are 10 lattice paths from (0,0) to (3,2).
The correspondence between bit strings and lattice paths does not
stop there. Here is another way to count lattice paths. Consider the
lattice shown below:
A

(3,2)
B

(0,0)

Any lattice path from (0,0) to (3,2) must pass through exactly one of A
and B. The point A is 4 steps away from (0,0) and two of them are towards
the right. The number of lattice paths to A is the same as the number of
4-bit strings of weight 2, namely 6. The point B is 4 steps away from (0,0),
but now 3 of them are towards the right. So the number of paths to point
B is the same as the number of 4-bit strings of weight 3, namely 4. So
the total number of paths to (3,2) is just 6 + 4. This is the same way we
calculated the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3. The point: the exact
same recurrence relation exists for bit strings and for lattice paths.

Binomial Coefficients
Binomial coefficients are the coefficients in the expanded version of a
binomial, such as (x + y)5 . What happens when we multiply such a
binomial out? We will expand (x + y)n for various values of n. Each of
these are done by multiplying everything out (i.e., FOIL-ing) and then
collecting like terms.
(x + y)1  x + y
(x + y)2  x 2 + 2x y + y 2
(x + y)3  x 3 + 3x 2 y + 3x y 2 + y 3

1.2. Binomial Coefficients

75

(x + y)4  x 4 + 4x 3 y + 6x 2 y 2 + 4x y 3 + y 4 .
In fact, there is a quicker way to expand the above binomials. For
example, consider the next one, (x + y)5 . What we are really doing is
multiplying out,
(x + y)(x + y)(x + y)(x + y)(x + y).
If that looks daunting, go back to the case of (x + y)3  (x + y)(x +
y)(x + y). Why do we only have one x 3 and y 3 but three x 2 y and x y 2
terms? Every time we distribute over an (x + y) we create two copies of
what is left, one multiplied by x, the other multiplied by y. To get x 3 , we
need to pick the “multiplied by x” side every time (we don’t have any y’s
in the term). This will only happen once. On the other hand, to get x 2 y
we need to select the x side twice and the y side once. In other words, we
need to pick one of the three (x + y) terms to “contribute” their y.
Similarly, in the expansion of (x + y)5 , there will be only one x 5 term
and one y 5 term. This is because to get an x 5 , we need to use the x term
in each of the copies of the binomial (x + y), and similarly for y 5 . What
about x 4 y? To get terms like this, we need to use four x’s and one y, so
we need exactly one of the five binomials to contribute a y. There are 5
choices for this, so there are 5 ways to get x 4 y, so the coefficient of x 4 y is
5. This is also the coefficient for x y 4 for the same (but opposite) reason:
there are 5 ways to pick which of the 5 binomials contribute the single x.
So far we have
(x + y)5  x 5 + 5x 4 y + ? x 3 y 2 + ? x 2 y 3 + 5x y 4 + y 5 .
We still need the coefficients of x 3 y 2 and x 2 y 3 . In both cases, we need
to pick exactly 3 of the 5 binomials to contribute one variable, the other
two to contribute the other. Wait. This sounds familiar. We have 5 things,
each can be one of two things, and we need a total of 3 of one of them.
That’s just like taking 5 bits and making sure exactly 3 of them are 1’s.
So the coefficient of x 3 y 2 (and also x 2 y 3 ) will be exactly the same as the
number of bit strings of length 5 and weight 3, which we found earlier to
be 10. So we have:
(x + y)5  x 5 + 5x 4 y + 10x 3 y 2 + 10x 2 y 3 + 5x y 4 + y 5 .
These numbers we keep seeing over and over again. They are the
number of subsets of a particular size, the number of bit strings of a
particular weight, the number of lattice paths, and the coefficients of
these binomial products. We will call them
binomial coefficients. We
n
even have a special symbol for them: k .

The last bullet point is usually taken as the definition of nk . Out of n

this. Each of our counting problems above can be viewed in this way:



• How many subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} contain exactly 3 elements? We
must choose 3 of the 5 elements to be in our subset. There are 53

ways to do this, so there are 53 such subsets.
• How many bit strings have length 5 and weight 3? We must choose
3 of the 5 bits to be 1’s. There are 53 ways to do this, so there are 53
such bit strings.
• How many lattice paths are there from (0,0) to (3,2)? We must choose
3 of the 5 steps to be towards the right. There are 53 ways to do this,

so there are 53 such lattice paths.
• What is the coefficient of x 3 y 2 in the expansion of (x + y)5 ? We must
choose
3 of the 5 copies of the binomial to contribute
an x. There
5
5
are 3 ways to do this, so the coefficient is 3 .
It should be clear that in each case above, we have the right answer.
All we had to do is phrase the question correctly and it became obvious
that 53 is correct. However, this does not tell us that the answer
is in fact
n
10 in each case. We will eventually find a formula for k , but for now,
look back at how we arrived at the answer 10 in our counting problems
above. It all came down to bit strings, and we have a recurrence relation
for bit strings:
n−1
|Bnk |  |Bn−1
k−1 | + |Bk |.

1.2. Binomial Coefficients

77

Remember, this is because we can start the bit string with either a 1 or
a 0. In both cases, we have n − 1 more bits to pick. The strings starting
with 1 must contain k − 1 more 1’s, while the strings starting with 0 still
need k more 1’s.

because
 0  1 for all n since there is only one way to pick 0 of n objects
and nn  1 since there is one way to select all n out of n objects. Using
the recurrence relation, and the fact that the sides of the triangle are 1’s,

we can easily replace all the entries above with the correct values of nk .
Doing so gives us Pascal’s triangle.

A permutation is a (possible) rearrangement of objects. For example,
there are 6 permutations of the letters a, b, c:
abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.
We know that we have them all listed above —there are 3 choices for
which letter we put first, then 2 choices for which letter comes next, which
leaves only 1 choice for the last letter. The multiplicative principle says
we multiply 3 · 2 · 1.
Example 1.3.1

How many permutations are there of the letters a, b, c, d, e, f ?
Solution. We do NOT want to try to list all of these out. However,
if we did, we would need to pick a letter to write down first. There
are 6 choices for that letter. For each choice of first letter, there are
5 choices for the second letter (we cannot repeat the first letter; we
are rearranging letters and only have one of each), and for each of
those, there are 4 choices for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2
choices for the fifth and finally only 1 choice for the last letter. So
there are 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1  720 permutations of the 6 letters.

1. Counting

A piece of notation is helpful here: n!, read “n factorial”, is the product
of all positive integers less than or equal to n (for reasons of convenience,
we also define 0! to be 1). So the number of permutation of 6 letters, as
seen in the previous example is 6!  6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1. This generalizes:
Permutations of n elements.
There are n!  n · (n − 1) · (n − 2) · · · · · 2 · 1 permutations of n (distinct)
elements.
Example 1.3.2 Counting Bijective Functions.

How many functions f : {1, 2, . . . , 8} → {1, 2, . . . , 8} are bĳective?
Solution. Remember what it means for a function to be bĳective:
each element in the codomain must be the image of exactly one
element of the domain. Using two-line notation, we could write
one of these bĳections as
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
.
f 
3 1 5 8 7 6 2 4





What we are really doing is just rearranging the elements of the
codomain, so we are creating a permutation of 8 elements. In fact,
“permutation” is another term used to describe bĳective functions
from a finite set to itself.
If you believe this, then you see the answer must be 8!  8 · 7 ·
· · · · 1  40320. You can see this directly as well: for each element
of the domain, we must pick a distinct element of the codomain to
map to. There are 8 choices for where to send 1, then 7 choices for
where to send 2, and so on. We multiply using the multiplicative
principle.
Sometimes we do not want to permute all of the letters/numbers/
elements we are given.
Example 1.3.3

How many 4 letter “words” can you make from the letters a through
f, with no repeated letters?
Solution. This is just like the problem of permuting 4 letters, only
now we have more choices for each letter. For the first letter, there
are 6 choices. For each of those, there are 5 choices for the second
letter. Then there are 4 choices for the third letter, and 3 choices for
the last letter. The total number of words is 6 · 5 · 4 · 3  360. This is

1.3. Combinations and Permutations

83

not 6! because we never multiplied by 2 and 1. We could start with
6! and then cancel the 2 and 1, and thus write 6!
2! .
In general, we can ask how many permutations exist of k objects
choosing those objects from a larger collection of n objects. (In the example
above, k  4, and n  6.) We write this number P(n, k) and sometimes
call it a k-permutation of n elements. From the example above, we see
that to compute P(n, k) we must apply the multiplicative principle to k
numbers, starting with n and counting backwards. For example
P(10, 4)  10 · 9 · 8 · 7.
Notice again that P(10, 4) starts out looking like 10!, but we stop after
7. We can formally account for this “stopping” by dividing away the part
of the factorial we do not want:
P(10, 4) 

10 · 9 · 8 · 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 10!

.
6·5·4·3·2·1
6!

Careful: The factorial in the denominator is not 4! but rather (10 − 4)!.
k-permutations of n elements.
P(n, k) is the number of k-permutations of n elements, the number
of ways to arrange k objects chosen from n distinct objects.
P(n, k) 

n!
 n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − (k − 1)).
(n − k)!

n!
Note that when n  k, we have P(n, n)  (n−n)!
 n! (since we defined
0! to be 1). This makes sense —we already know n! gives the number of
permutations of all n objects.

Example 1.3.4 Counting injective functions.

How many functions f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} are injective?
Solution. Note that it doesn’t make sense to ask for the number
of bĳections here, as there are none (because the codomain is larger
than the domain, there are no surjections). But for a function to be
injective, we just can’t use an element of the codomain more than
once.
We need to pick an element from the codomain to be the image
of 1. There are 8 choices. Then we need to pick one of the remaining
7 elements to be the image of 2. Finally, one of the remaining 6

84

1. Counting

elements must be the image of 3. So the total number of functions
is 8 · 7 · 6  P(8, 3).
What this demonstrates in general is that the number of injections f : A → B, where |A|  k and |B|  n, is P(n, k).
Here is another way to find the number of k-permutations of n elements: first select which k elements will be in the permutation, then
count how many ways there are to arrange them. Once you have selected
the k objects, we know there are k! ways to arrange (permute) them. But
how do you select k objects from the n? You have
n objects, and you
n
need to choose k of them. You can do that in k ways. Then for each
choice of those k elements, we can permute them in k! ways. Using the
multiplicative principle, we get another formula for P(n, k):
P(n, k) 

 

n
· k!.
k

Now since we have a closed formula for P(n, k) already, we can substitute that in:
 
n
n!

· k!.
k
(n − k)!
If we divide both sides by k! we get a closed formula for

We say P(n, k) counts permutations, and nk counts combinations. The
formulas for
 each are very similar, there is just an extra
 k! in the denominator of nk . That extra k! accounts for the fact that nk does not distinguish
between the different orders that the k objects can appear in. We are just
selecting (or choosing) the k objects, not arranging them. Perhaps “combination” is a misleading label. We don’t mean it like a combination lock
(where the order would definitely matter). Perhaps a better metaphor
is a combination of flavors — you just need to decide which flavors to
combine, not the order in which to combine them.
To further illustrate the connection between combinations and permutations, we close with an example.



1.3. Combinations and Permutations

Example 1.3.5

You decide to have a dinner party. Even though you are incredibly
popular and have 14 different friends, you only have enough chairs
to invite 6 of them.
1. How many choices do you have for which 6 friends to invite?
2. What if you need to decide not only which friends to invite
but also where to seat them along your long table? How
many choices do you have then?
Solution.
1. You must simply choose
6 friends from a group of 14. This
14
can be done in 6 ways. We can find this number either by
14!
using Pascal’s triangle or the closed formula: 8!·6!
 3003.
2. Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends
chosen from a group of 14. So the answer is P(14, 6), which
can be calculated as 14!
8!  2162160.
Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions: how many injective functions
are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends (the
functions are injective because you can’t have a single chair
go to two of your friends).
How are these
numbers related? Notice that P(14, 6) is much

.
This
makes sense. 14
larger than 14
6
6 picks 6 friends, but P(14, 6)
arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them. In fact, we can say
exactly how much larger P(14, 6) is. In both counting problems we
choose 6 out of 14 friends. For the first one, we stop there, at 3003
ways. But for the second counting problem, each of those 3003
choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly 6! ways. So now we
have 3003 · 6! choices and that is exactly 2162160.
Alternatively, look at the first problem another way. We want
to select 6 out of 14 friends, but we do not care about the order they
are selected in. To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this:
14 · 13 · 12 · 11 · 10 · 9.
This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first
guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong
(in fact, that product is exactly 2162160  P(14, 6)). It distinguishes

85

86

1. Counting

between the different orders in which we could invite the guests.
To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different
arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as
just one outcome). There are precisely 6! ways to arrange 6 guests,
so the correct answer to the first question is
14 · 13 · 12 · 11 · 10 · 9
.
6!
Note that another way to write this is
14!
.
8! · 6!
which is what we had originally.

1. Counting

There are lots of patterns hidden away in the triangle, enough to fill a
reasonably sized book. Here are just a few of the most obvious ones:
1. The entries on the border of the triangle are all 1.
2. Any entry not on the border is the sum of the two entries above it.
3. The triangle is symmetric. In any row, entries on the left side are
mirrored on the right side.
4. The sum of all entries on a given row is a power of 2. (You should
check this!)
We would like to state these observations in a more precise way, and
then prove that they are correct. Now each entry in Pascal’s triangle is

in fact a binomial coefficient. The 1 on the very top of the triangle is 00 .
The next row (which
 we will
 call row 1, even though it is not the top-most
row) consists of 10 and 11 . Row 4 (the row 1, 4, 6, 4, 1) consists of the
binomial coefficients

This is certainly a valid proof, but also is entirely useless. Even if you
understand the proof perfectly, it does not tell you
 why the identity is true.
A better approach would be to explain what nk means and then say why
 n−1
that is also what n−1
means. Let’s see how this works for the four
k−1 + k
identities we observed above.
Example 1.4.2

Explain why

n
0

 1 and

n
n

 1.

Solution. What do these binomial coefficients tell us? Well, n0
gives the number of ways to select 0 objects from a collection of n
objects. There is only one
way to do this, namely
to not select any
n
n
of the objects. Thus 0  1. Similarly, n gives the number of
ways to select n objects from a collection of n objects.
There is only
n
one way to do this: select all n objects.
Thus n  1.

Alternatively, we know that n0 is the number of n-bit strings
with weight 0. There is only one such string, the string of all 0’s.



92

1. Counting

So n0  1. Similarly nn is the number of n-bit strings with weight
n. There is only one string with this property, the string of all 1’s.
Another way: n0 gives the number of subsets of a set of size
n containing
0 elements. There is only one such subset, the empty
n
set. n gives the number of subsets containing n elements. The
only such subset is the original set (of all elements).





Example 1.4.3

Explain why

n
k



n−1
k−1

+

n−1
k .

Solution. The easiest way to see this is to consider bit strings. nk
is the number of bit strings of length n containing k 1’s. Of all of
these strings, some start with a 1 and the rest start with a 0. First
consider all the bit strings which start with a 1. After the 1, there
must be n − 1 more bits (to get the total length up to n) and exactly
k − 1 of them must be 1’s (as we already have one, and we need
k total).
How many strings are there like that? There are exactly
n−1
such
bit strings, so of all the length n bit strings containing
k−1

n−1
k 1’s, k−1 of them start with a 1. Similarly, there are n−1
which
k
start with a 0 (we still need
n
−
1
bits
and
now
k
of
them
must
be
n−1
1’s). Since there are k bit strings containing n − 1 bits with k
1’s, that is the number of length
bitstrings with k 1’s which start
 n n−1
+
with a 0. Therefore nk  n−1
k−1
k .
Another way: consider the question, how many ways can you
select k pizza toppings from a menu containing n choices? One
way to do this is just nk . Another way to answer the same question
is to first decide whether or not you want anchovies. If you do
want anchovies, you still need to pick k − 1 toppings, now from
just n − 1 choices. That can be done in n−1
k−1 ways. If you do not
want anchovies, then you still need to select k toppings
 from n − 1
choices (the anchovies are out). You can do that in n−1
k ways. Since
the choices with anchovies are disjoint
the choices without
 n−1from

anchovies, the total choices are n−1
+
.
But
wait. We answered
k−1
k
the same question intwo different
ways, so the two answers must

n−1
be the same. Thus nk  n−1
+
k−1
k .
You can also explain (prove) this identity by counting subsets,
or even lattice paths.



1.4. Combinatorial Proofs

Example 1.4.4

Prove the binomial identity

n
k

n 
n−k .



Solution. Why is this true? nk counts the number of ways to
n
select k things from n choices. On the other hand, n−k
counts the
number of ways to select n − k things from n choices. Are these
really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the n − k things
you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose
n
n − k things to exclude from n choices. Clearly this is n−k
as well
(it doesn’t matter whether you include or exclude the things once
you have chosen them). And if you exclude n − k things, then you
are including the other k things. So the set of outcomes should be
the same.
Let’s try the pizza counting example like we did above. How
many ways are there to pick k toppings from a list of n choices? On
the one hand, the answer is simply nk . Alternatively, you could
make a list of all the toppings you don’t want. To end up with a
pizza containing exactly k toppings, you
need to pick n −k toppings
n 
to not put on the pizza. You have n−k choices for the toppings you
don’t want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with k toppings,
in fact all the ways to get a pizza
k toppings. Thus these two
 with
n 
answers must be the same: nk  n−k
.
You can also prove (explain) this identity using bit strings,
sub
sets, or lattice paths. The bit string argument is nice: nk counts the
number of bit strings of length n with k 1’s. This is also the number
of bit string of length n with k 0’s (just replace each 1 with a 0 and
each 0 with a 1). But if a string of length
n has k 0’s, it must have
n 
n − k 1’s. And there are exactly n−k
strings of length n with n − k
1’s.

If a pizza joint offers n toppings, how many pizzas can you build
using any number of toppings from no toppings to all toppings,
using each topping at most once?
On one hand, the answer is 2n . For each topping you can say
“yes” or “no,” so you have two choices for each topping.
On the other hand, divide the possible pizzas into disjoint
groups: the pizzas with no toppings, the pizzas with one top-

ping, the pizzas with two toppings, etc. If we want no toppings,
there is only one pizza like that (the empty pizza,
if you will) but
n
it would be better to think of that number as 0 since we choose 0
of the n toppings. How many pizzas
have 1 topping? We need to
n
choose 1 of the n toppings, so 1 . We have:

Again, we could have proved the identity using subsets, bit
strings, or lattice paths (although the lattice path argument is a
little tricky).
Hopefully this gives some idea of how explanatory proofs of binomial
identities can go. It is worth pointing out that more traditional proofs can
also be beautiful.2 For example, consider the following rather slick proof
of the last identity.
Expand the binomial (x + y)n :

More Proofs
The explanatory proofs given in the above examples are typically called
combinatorial proofs. In general, to give a combinatorial proof for a
binomial identity, say A  B you do the following:
1. Find a counting problem you will be able to answer in two ways.
2. Explain why one answer to the counting problem is A.
3. Explain why the other answer to the counting problem is B.
Since both A and B are the answers to the same question, we must
have A  B.
The tricky thing is coming up with the question. This is not always
obvious, but it gets easier the more counting problems you solve. You will
start to recognize types of answers as the answers to types of questions.
More often what will happen is you will be solving a counting problem
and happen to think up two different ways of finding the answer. Now
you have a binomial identity and the proof is right there. The proof is the
problem you just solved together with your two solutions.
For example, consider this counting question:
How many 10-letter words use exactly four A’s, three B’s, two
C’s and one D?
Let’s try to solve this problem. We have 10 spots for letters to go. Four
of those need to be A’s. We can pick the four A-spots in 10
4 ways. Now
where can we put the B’s? Well there
are
only
6
spots
left,
we
need to pick
6
3 of them. This can be done in 3 ways. The two C’s need to go in two

of the 3 remaining spots, so we have 32 ways of doing that. That leaves

just one spot of the D, but we could write that 1 choice as 11 . Thus the
answer is:
    
10 6 3 1
.
4 3 2 1
But why stop there? We can find the answer another way too. First
let’s decide where to put the one D:
we have 10 spots, we need to choose
1
10
9
of them, so this can be done in 1 ways. Next, choose one of the 2 ways
to place the two C’s. We now have
 7 spots left, and three of them need
to be filled with B’s. There are 73 ways to do this. Finally the A’s can be

placed in 44 (that is, only one) ways. So another answer to the question is

Solution. To give a combinatorial proof we need to think up a
question we can answer in two ways: one way needs to give the
left-hand-side of the identity, the other way needs to be the righthand-side of the identity. Our clue to what question to ask comes
from the right-hand side: n+2
3 counts the number of ways to select
3 things from a group of n + 2 things. Let’s name those things
1, 2, 3, . . . , n + 2. In other words, we want to find 3-element subsets
of those numbers (since order should not matter, subsets are exactly
the right thing to think about). We will have to be a bit clever
to explain why the left-hand-side also gives the number of these
subsets. Here’s the proof.
Proof. Consider the question “How many 3-element subsets are
there of the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , n + 2}?” We answer this in two ways:
Answer 1: We must select 3 elements
from the collection of n +2
n+2
elements. This can be done in 3 ways.
Answer 2: Break this problem up into cases by what the middle
number in the subset is. Say each subset is {a, b, c} written in
increasing order. We count the number of subsets for each distinct
value of b. The smallest possible value of b is 2, and the largest is
n + 1.
When b  2, there are 1 · n subsets: 1 choice for a and n choices
(3 through n + 2) for c.
When b  3, there are 2 · (n − 1) subsets: 2 choices for a and
n − 1 choices for c.
When b  4, there are 3 · (n − 2) subsets: 3 choices for a and
n − 2 choices for c.
And so on. When b  n + 1, there are n choices for a and only
1 choice for c, so n · 1 subsets.
Therefore the total number of subsets is
1n + 2(n − 1) + 3(n − 2) + · · · + (n − 1)2 + n1.

1.4. Combinatorial Proofs

Since Answer 1 and Answer 2 are answers to the same question,
they must be equal. Therefore

Solution. We will give two different proofs of this fact. The first
will be very similar to the previous example (counting subsets).
The second proof is a little slicker, using lattice paths.
Proof. Consider the question: “How many pizzas can you make
using n toppings when there are 2n toppings to choose from?”
Answer 1: There are 2n toppings, from which you must choose
n. This can be done in 2n
n ways.
Answer 2: Divide the toppings into two groups of n toppings
(perhaps n meats and n veggies). Any choice of n toppings must
include some number from the first group and some number from
the second group. Consider each possible number of meat toppings
separately:
 
0 meats: n0 nn , since you need to choose 0 of the n meats and
n of the n veggies.
 n 
1 meat: n1 n−1
, since you need 1 of n meats so n − 1 of n
veggies.
 n 
2 meats: n2 n−2
. Choose 2 meats and the remaining n − 2
toppings from the n veggies.
 
And so on. The last case is n meats, which can be done in nn n0
ways.
Thus the total number of pizzas possible is

For an alternative proof, we use lattice paths. This is reasonable
to consider because the right-hand side of the identity reminds us
of the number of paths from (0, 0) to (n, n).
Proof. Consider the question: How many lattice paths are there
from (0, 0) to (n, n)?
Answer 1: We must travel 2n steps,
and n of them must be in
2n 
the up direction. Thus there are n paths.
Answer 2: Note that any path from (0, 0) to (n, n) must cross
the line x + y  n. That is, any path must pass through exactly one
of the points: (0, n), (1, n − 1), (2, n − 2), . . . , (n, 0). For example,
this is what happens in the case n  4:
(0,4)

(4,4)
(1,3)
(2,2)
(3,1)
(4,0)

(0,0)

x+y4

How many paths pass through (0, n)? To get to that point, you
must
travel n units, and 0 of them are to the right, so there are
n
ways
to get to (0, n). From (0,
n) to (n, n) takes n steps, and 0
0
n
of them are up. So there
 are 0 ways to get from (0, n) to (n, n).
Therefore there are n0 n0 paths from (0, 0) to (n, n) through the
point (0, n).

What about through (1, n −1). There are n1 paths to get there
(n steps, 1 to the right) and n1 paths
 to
 complete the journey to
(n, n) (n steps, 1 up). So there are n1 n1 paths from (0, 0) to (n, n)
through (1, n − 1).
In general, to get to (n, n) through the
point (k, n − k) we have
n
n
k paths to the midpoint and then k paths from the midpoint

1.4. Combinatorial Proofs

99

to (n, n). So there are nk nk paths from (0, 0) to (n, n) through
(k, n − k).
All together then the total paths from (0, 0) to (n, n) passing
through exactly one of these midpoints is

Consider the following counting problem:
You have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids. How many ways can you
do this?
Take a moment to think about how you might solve this problem. You
may assume that it is acceptable to give a kid no cookies. Also, the cookies
are all identical and the order in which you give out the cookies does not
matter.
Before solving the problem, here is a wrong answer: You might guess
that the answer should be 47 because for each of the 7 cookies, there are 4
choices of kids to which you can give the cookie. This is reasonable, but
wrong. To see why, consider a few possible outcomes: we could assign
the first six cookies to kid A, and the seventh cookie to kid B. Another
outcome would assign the first cookie to kid B and the six remaining
cookies to kid A. Both outcomes are included in the 47 answer. But for

104

1. Counting

our counting problem, both outcomes are really the same – kid A gets six
cookies and kid B gets one cookie.
What do outcomes actually look like? How can we represent them?
One approach would be to write an outcome as a string of four numbers
like this:
3112,
which represent the outcome in which the first kid gets 3 cookies, the
second and third kid each get 1 cookie, and the fourth kid gets 2 cookies.
Represented this way, the order in which the numbers occur matters. 1312
is a different outcome, because the first kid gets a one cookie instead of
3. Each number in the string can be any integer between 0 and 7. But the
answer is not 74 . We need the sum of the numbers to be 7.
Another way we might represent outcomes is to write a string of seven
letters:
ABAADCD,
which represents that the first cookie goes to kid A, the second cookie
goes to kid B, the third and fourth cookies go to kid A, and so on. In fact,
this outcome is identical to the previous one—A gets 3 cookies, B and C
get 1 each and D gets 2. Each of the seven letters in the string can be any
of the 4 possible letters (one for each kid), but the number of such strings
is not 47 , because here order does not matter. In fact, another way to write
the same outcome is
AAABCDD.
This will be the preferred representation of the outcome. Since we can
write the letters in any order, we might as well write them in alphabetical
order for the purposes of counting. So we will write all the A’s first, then
all the B’s, and so on.
Now think about how you could specify such an outcome. All we
really need to do is say when to switch from one letter to the next. In
terms of cookies, we need to say after how many cookies do we stop giving
cookies to the first kid and start giving cookies to the second kid. And
then after how many do we switch to the third kid? And after how many
do we switch to the fourth? So yet another way to represent an outcome
is like this:
∗ ∗ ∗| ∗ | ∗ | ∗ ∗.
Three cookies go to the first kid, then we switch and give one cookie to
the second kid, then switch, one to the third kid, switch, two to the fourth
kid. Notice that we need 7 stars and 3 bars – one star for each cookie, and
one bar for each switch between kids, so one fewer bars than there are
kids (we don’t need to switch after the last kid – we are done).
Why have we done all of this? Simple: to count the number of ways
to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids, all we need to do is count how many

1.5. Stars and Bars

105

stars and bars charts there are. But a stars and bars chart is just a string of
symbols, some stars and some bars. If instead of stars and bars we would
use 0’s and 1’s, it would just be a bit string. We know how to count those.
Before we get too excited, we should make sure that really any string of
(in our case) 7 stars and 3 bars corresponds to a different way to distribute
cookies to kids. In particular consider a string like this:
| ∗ ∗ ∗ || ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗.
Does that correspond to a cookie distribution? Yes. It represents the
distribution in which kid A gets 0 cookies (because we switch to kid B
before any stars), kid B gets three cookies (three stars before the next
bar), kid C gets 0 cookies (no stars before the next bar) and kid D gets
the remaining 4 cookies. No matter how the stars and bars are arranged,
we can distribute cookies in that way. Also, given any way to distribute
cookies, we can represent that with a stars and bars chart. For example,
the distribution in which kid A gets 6 cookies and kid B gets 1 cookie has
the following chart:
∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ | ∗ ||.
After all that work we are finally ready to count. Each way to distribute
cookies corresponds to a stars and bars chart with 7 stars and 3 bars. So
there are 10 symbols, and we must choose 3 of them to be bars. Thus:
There are

10
ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids.
3

 

While we are at it, we can also answer a related question: how many
ways are there to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids so that each kid gets at
least one cookie? What can you say about the corresponding stars and
bars charts? The charts must start and end with at least one star (so that
kids A and D) get cookies, and also no two bars can be adjacent (so that
kids B and C are not skipped). One way to assure this is to place bars only
in the spaces between the stars. With 7 stars, there are 6 spots between the
stars, so we must choose 3 of those 6 spots to fill with bars. Thus there
are 63 ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids giving at least one cookie to
each kid.
Another (and more general) way to approach this modified problem
is to first give each kid one cookie. Now the remaining 3 cookies can be
distributed to the 4 kids without restrictions. So we have 3 stars and 3
bars for a total of
6 symbols, 3 of which must be bars. So again we see
6
that there are 3 ways to distribute the cookies.
Stars and bars can be used in counting problems other than kids and
cookies. Here are a few examples:

106

1. Counting

Example 1.5.1

Your favorite mathematical ice-cream parlor offers 10 flavors. How
many milkshakes could you create using exactly 6, not necessarily
distinct scoops? The order you add the flavors does not matter
(they will be blended up anyway) but you are allowed repeats.
So one possible shake is triple chocolate, double cherry, and mint
chocolate chip.
Solution. We get six scoops, each of which could be one of ten
possible flavors. Represent each scoop as a star. Think of going
down the counter one flavor at a time: you see vanilla first, and
skip to the next, chocolate. You say yes to chocolate three times
(use three stars), then switch to the next flavor. You keep skipping
until you get to cherry, which you say yes to twice. Another switch
and you are at mint chocolate chip. You say yes once. Then you
keep switching until you get past the last flavor, never saying yes
again (since you already have said yes six times). There are ten
flavors to choose from, so we must switch from considering one
flavor to the next nine times. These are the nine bars.
Now that we are confident that we have the right number of
stars and bars, we answer the question simply: there are 6 stars
and 9 bars, so 15 symbols. We need to pick
 9 of them to be bars, so
the number of milkshakes possible is 15
9 .
Example 1.5.2

How many 7 digit phone numbers are there in which the digits
are non-increasing? That is, every digit is less than or equal to the
previous one.
Solution. We need to decide on 7 digits so we will use 7 stars. The
bars will represent a switch from each possible single digit number
down to the next smaller one. So the phone number 866-5221 is
represented by the stars and bars chart
| ∗ || ∗ ∗| ∗ ||| ∗ ∗| ∗ |.
There are 10 choices for each digit (0-9) so we must switch
between choices 9 times. We have
 7 stars and 9 bars, so the total
number of phone numbers is 16
9 .

x 1 + x 2 + x 3 + x4 + x 5  13.
(An integer solution to an equation is a solution in which the
unknown must have an integer value.)
1. where x i ≥ 0 for each x i ?
2. where x i > 0 for each x i ?
3. where x i ≥ 2 for each x i ?
Solution. This problem is just like giving 13 cookies to 5 kids. We
need to say how many of the 13 units go to each of the 5 variables.
In other words, we have 13 stars and 4 bars (the bars are like the
“+” signs in the equation).
1. If x i can be 0 or greater, we are in the standard case with no
restrictions. So 13 stars and 4 bars can be arranged in 17
4
ways.
2. Now each variable must be at least 1. So give one unit to each
variable to satisfy that restriction. Now there are
 8 stars left,
and still 4 bars, so the number of solutions is 12
4 .
3. Now each variable must be 2 or greater. So before any counting, give each variable 2 units. We now have 3 remaining
stars and 4 bars, so there are 74 solutions.
Counting with Functions.
Many of the counting problems in this section might at first appear to be
examples of counting functions. After all, when we try to count the number
of ways to distribute cookies to kids, we are assigning each cookie to a
kid, just like you assign elements of the domain of a function to elements
in the codomain. However, the number of ways to assign 7 cookies to 4

108

1. Counting

kids is 10
7  120, while the number of functions f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} →
{a, b, c, d} is 47  16384. What is going on here?
When we count functions, we consider the following two functions,
for example, to be different:



1 2 3 4 5 6 7
f 
a b c c c c c





1 2 3 4 5 6 7
g
.
b a c c c c c





But these two functions would correspond to the same cookie distribution:
kids a and b each get one cookie, kid c gets the rest (and none for kid d).
The point: elements of the domain are distinguished, cookies are
indistinguishable. This is analogous to the distinction between permutations (like counting functions) and combinations (not).

Stars and bars allows us to count the number of ways to distribute
10 cookies to 3 kids and natural number solutions to x + y + z  11, for
example. A relatively easy modification allows us to put a lower bound
restriction on these problems: perhaps each kid must get at least two
cookies or x, y, z ≥ 2. This was done by first assigning each kid (or
variable) 2 cookies (or units) and then distributing the rest using stars
and bars.
What if we wanted an upper bound restriction? For example, we might
insist that no kid gets more than 4 cookies or that x, y, z ≤ 4. It turns out
this is considerably harder, but still possible. The idea is to count all the
distributions and then remove those that violate the condition. In other
words, we must count the number of ways to distribute 11 cookies to 3
kids in which one or more of the kids gets more than 4 cookies. For any
particular kid, this is not a problem; we do this using stars and bars. But

112

1. Counting

how to combine the number of ways for kid A, or B or C? We must use
the PIE.
The Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion (PIE) gives a method for finding
the cardinality of the union of not necessarily disjoint sets. We saw in
Section 1.1 how this works with three sets. To find how many things
are in one or more of the sets A, B, and C, we should just add up the
number of things in each of these sets. However, if there is any overlap
among the sets, those elements are counted multiple times. So we subtract
the things in each intersection of a pair of sets. But doing this removes
elements which are in all three sets once too often, so we need to add it
back in. In terms of cardinality of sets, we have
|A ∪ B ∪ C|  |A| + |B| + |C| − |A ∩ B| − |A ∩ C| − |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.
Example 1.6.1

Three kids, Alberto, Bernadette, and Carlos, decide to share 11
cookies. They wonder how many ways they could split the cookies
up provided that none of them receive more than 4 cookies (someone receiving no cookies is for some reason acceptable to these
kids).
Solution. Without
the “no more than 4” restriction, the answer
13
would be 2 , using 11 stars and 2 bars (separating the three kids).
Now count the number of ways that one or more of the kids violates
the condition, i.e., gets at least 4 cookies.
Let A be the set of outcomes in which Alberto gets more than
4 cookies. Let B be the set of outcomes in which Bernadette gets
more than 4 cookies. Let C be the set of outcomes in which Carlos
gets more than 4 cookies. We then are looking (for the sake of
subtraction) for the size of the set A ∪ B ∪ C. Using PIE, we must
find the sizes of |A|, |B|, |C|, |A ∩ B| and so on. Here is what we
find.
• |A|  82 . First give Alberto 5 cookies, then distribute the
remaining 6 to the three kids without restrictions, using 6
stars and 2 bars.



• |B|  82 . Just like above, only now Bernadette gets 5 cookies
at the start.



• |C| 

2 .

Carlos gets 5 cookies first.

• |A ∩ B|  32 . Give Alberto and Bernadette 5 cookies each,
leaving 1 (star) to distribute to the three kids (2 bars).

• |A ∩ C| 

Thus the answer to the original question is 13
2 −75  78−75  3.
This makes sense now that we see it. The only way to ensure that no
kid gets more than 4 cookies is to give two kids 4 cookies and one
kid 3; there are three choices for which kid that should be. We could
have found the answer much quicker through this observation, but
the point of the example is to illustrate that PIE works!



For four or more sets, we do not write down a formula for PIE. Instead,
we just think of the principle: add up all the elements in single sets, then
subtract out things you counted twice (elements in the intersection of a
pair of sets), then add back in elements you removed too often (elements
in the intersection of groups of three sets), then take back out elements
you added back in too often (elements in the intersection of groups of four
sets), then add back in, take back out, add back in, etc. This would be very
difficult if it wasn’t for the fact that in these problems, all the cardinalities
of the single sets are equal, as are all the cardinalities of the intersections
of two sets, and that of three sets, and so on. Thus we can group all of
these together and multiply by how many different combinations of 1, 2,
3, . . . sets there are.
Example 1.6.2

How many ways can you distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids so that no
kid gets more than 2 cookies?
Solution. There are 13
3 ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids
(using 10 stars and 3 bars). We will subtract all the outcomes in
which a kid gets 3 or more cookies. How many outcomes are there
like that? We can force kid A to eat 3 or more cookies by giving him
3 cookies before we start. Doing so reduces the problem to one in
which we have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids without any restrictions.
In that case, we have 7 stars (the 7 remaining cookies) and 3 bars
(one less
 than the number of kids) so we can distribute the cookies
in 10
3 ways. Of course we could choose any one of the 4 kids to



114

1. Counting

give too many cookies, so it would appear that there are 41 10
3
ways to distribute the cookies giving too many to one kid. But in
fact, we have over counted.
We must get rid of the outcomes
in which two kids have too

many cookies. There are 42 ways to select 2 kids to give extra
cookies. It takes 6 cookies to do this, leaving only 4 cookies. So we
have 4 stars and still 3 bars. The remaining
4 cookies can thus be
7
4
distributed in 3 ways (for each of the 2 choices of which 2 kids
to over-feed).
But now we have removed too much. We must add back in all
the ways to give too many cookies to three kids. This uses 9 cookies,
leaving only 1 to distribute
to the 4 kids using stars and bars, which

can be done in 43 ways. We must consider this outcome for every

possible choice of which three kids we over-feed, and there are 43
ways of selecting that set of 3 kids.
Next we would subtract all the ways to give four kids too many
cookies, but in this case, that number is 0.
All together we get that the number of ways to distribute 10
cookies to 4 kids without giving any kid more than 2 cookies is:

but since PIE works, this equality must hold.
Just so you don’t think that these problems always have easier solutions, consider the following example.
Example 1.6.3

Earlier (Example 1.5.3) we counted the number of solutions to the
equation
x 1 + x 2 + x3 + x 4 + x 5  13,

1.6. Advanced Counting Using PIE

115

where x i ≥ 0 for each x i .
How many of those solutions have 0 ≤ x i ≤ 3 for each x i ?
Solution. We must subtract off the number of solutions in which
one or more of the variables has a value greater than 3. We will need
to use PIE because counting the number of solutions for which each
of the five variables separately are greater than 3 counts solutions
multiple times. Here is what we get:
• Total solutions:

17
4 .

• Solutions where x 1 > 3: 13
4 . Give x 1 4 units first, then
distribute the remaining 9 units to the 5 variables.



• Solutions where x 1 > 3 and x 2 > 3: 94 . After you give 4
units to x 1 and another 4 to x 2 , you only have 5 units left to
distribute.



• Solutions where x 1 > 3, x 2 > 3 and x3 > 3:

5
4 .

• Solutions where x 1 > 3, x 2 > 3, x 3 > 3, and x 4 > 3: 0.
We also need to account for the fact that we could choose any
of the five variables in the place of x 1 above (so there will be 51
outcomes
like this), any pair of variables in the place of x 1 and

x2 ( 52 outcomes) and so on. It is because of this that the double
counting occurs, so we need to use PIE. All together we have that

The advanced use of PIE has applications beyond stars and bars. A
derangement of n elements {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} is a permutation in which no

116

1. Counting

element is fixed. For example, there are 6 permutations of the three
elements {1, 2, 3}:
123 132 213 231 312 321.
but most of these have one or more elements fixed: 123 has all three
elements fixed since all three elements are in their original positions, 132
has the first element fixed (1 is in its original first position), and so on. In
fact, the only derangements of three elements are
231 and 312.
If we go up to 4 elements, there are 24 permutations (because we
have 4 choices for the first element, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices
for the third leaving only 1 choice for the last). How many of these are
derangements? If you list out all 24 permutations and eliminate those
which are not derangements, you will be left with just 9 derangements.
Let’s see how we can get that number using PIE.
Example 1.6.4

How many derangements are there of 4 elements?
Solution. We count all permutations, and subtract those which are
not derangements. There are 4!  24 permutations of 4 elements.
Now for a permutation to not be a derangement,
at least one of the

4 elements must be fixed. There are 41 choices for which single
element we fix. Once fixed, we need to find a permutation of the
other three elements. There are 3! permutations on 3 elements.
But now we have counted too many non-derangements, so we
must subtract those permutations which fix two elements. There
are 42 choices for which two elements we fix, and then for each
pair, 2! permutations of the remaining elements. But this subtracts
too
many, so add back in permutations
which fix 3 elements, all
4

them.
Finally
subtract
the

(recall 0!  1)

which fix all four elements. All together we get that the number of

Of course we can use a similar formula to count the derangements
of any number of elements. However, the more elements we have, the

Example 1.6.5

Five gentlemen attend a party, leaving their hats at the door. At the
end of the party, they hastily grab hats on their way out. How many
different ways could this happen so that none of the gentlemen
leave with his own hat?
Solution. We are counting derangements on 5 elements. There are
5! ways for the gentlemen to grab hats in any order—but many of
these permutations will result in someone getting their own hat.
So we subtract all the ways in which one or more of the men get
their own hat. In other words, we subtract the non-derangements.
Doing so requires PIE. Thus the answer is:

We have seen throughout this chapter that many counting questions
can be rephrased as questions about counting functions with certain properties. This is reasonable since many counting questions can be thought

118

1. Counting

of as counting the number of ways to assign elements from one set to
elements of another.
Example 1.6.6

You decide to give away your video game collection so as to better
spend your time studying advanced mathematics. How many ways
can you do this, provided:
1. You want to distribute your 3 different PS4 games among 5
friends, so that no friend gets more than one game?
2. You want to distribute your 8 different 3DS games among 5
friends?
3. You want to distribute your 8 different SNES games among 5
friends, so that each friend gets at least one game?
In each case, model the counting question as a function counting
question.
Solution.
1. We must use the three games (call them 1, 2, 3) as the domain
and the 5 friends (a,b,c,d,e) as the codomain (otherwise the
function would not be defined for the whole domain when
a friend didn’t get any game). So how many functions are
there with domain {1, 2, 3} and codomain {a, b, c, d, e}? The
answer to this is 53  125, since we can assign any of 5 elements to be the image of 1, any of 5 elements to be the image
of 2 and any of 5 elements to be the image of 3.
But this is not the correct answer to our counting problem,


1 2 3
because one of these functions is f 
; one friend
a a a
can get more than one game. What we really need to do is
count injective functions. This gives P(5, 3)  60 functions,
which is the answer to our counting question.
2. Again, we need to use the 8 games as the domain and the 5
friends as the codomain. We are counting all functions, so
the number of ways to distribute the games is 58 .
3. This question is harder. Use the games as the domain and
friends as the codomain (the reverse would not give a function). To ensure that every friend gets at least one game means
that every element of the codomain is in the range. In other
words, we are looking for surjective functions. How do you
count those??

1.6. Advanced Counting Using PIE

119

In Example 1.1.5 we saw how to count all functions (using the multiplicative principle) and in Example 1.3.4 we learned how to count injective functions (using permutations). Surjective functions are not as easily
counted (unless the size of the domain is smaller than the codomain, in
which case there are none).
The idea is to count the functions which are not surjective, and then
subtract that from the total number of functions. This works very well
when the codomain has two elements in it:
Example 1.6.7

How many functions f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → {a, b} are surjective?
Solution. There are 25 functions all together, two choices for where
to send each of the 5 elements of the domain. Now of these, the
functions which are not surjective must exclude one or more elements of the codomain from the range. So first, consider functions
for which a is not in the range. This can only happen one way: everything gets sent to b. Alternatively, we could exclude b from the
range. Then everything gets sent to a, so there is only one function
like this. These are the only ways in which a function could not
be surjective (no function excludes both a and b from the range) so
there are exactly 25 − 2 surjective functions.
When there are three elements in the codomain, there are now three
choices for a single element to exclude from the range. Additionally, we
could pick pairs of two elements to exclude from the range, and we must
make sure we don’t over count these. It’s PIE time!
Example 1.6.8

How many functions f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → {a, b, c} are surjective?
Solution. Again start with the total number of functions: 35 (as
each of the five elements of the domain can go to any of three
elements of the codomain). Now we count the functions which are
not surjective.
Start by excluding a from the range. Then we have two choices
(b or c) for where to send each of the five elements of the domain.
Thus there are 25 functions which exclude a from the range. Similarly, there are 25 functions which exclude b, and another 25 which
exclude c. Now have we counted all functions which are not surjective? Yes, but in fact, we have counted some multiple times. For
example, the function which sends everything to c was one of the 25
functions we counted when we excluded a from the range, and also

120

1. Counting

one of the 25 functions we counted when we excluded b from the
range. We must subtract out all the functions which specifically
exclude two elements from the range. There is 1 function when
we exclude a and b (everything goes to c), one function when we
exclude a and c, and one function when we exclude b and c.
We are using PIE: to count the functions which are not surjective, we added up the functions which exclude a, b, and c separately,
then subtracted the functions which exclude pairs of elements. We
would then add back in the functions which exclude groups of
three elements, except that there are no such functions. We find
that the number of functions which are not surjective is
25 + 25 + 25 − 1 − 1 − 1 + 0.
Perhaps a more descriptive way to write this is
3 5

since each of the 25 ’s was the result of choosing 1 of the 3 elements
of the codomain to exclude from the range, each of the three 15 ’s
was the result of choosing 2 of the 3 elements of the codomain to
exclude. Writing 15 instead of 1 makes sense too: we have 1 choice
of where to send each of the 5 elements of the domain.
Now we can finally count the number of surjective functions:

You might worry that to count surjective functions when the codomain
is larger than 3 elements would be too tedious. We need to use PIE but
with more than 3 sets the formula for PIE is very long. However, we have
lucked out. As we saw in the example above, the number of functions
which exclude a single element from the range is the same no matter
which single element is excluded. Similarly, the number of functions
which exclude a pair of elements will be the same for every pair. With
larger codomains, we will see the same behavior with groups of 3, 4, and
more elements excluded. So instead of adding/subtracting each of these,
we can simply add or subtract all of them at once, if you know how many
there are. This works just like it did in for the other types of counting
questions in this section, only now the size of the various combinations of
sets is a number raised to a power, as opposed to a binomial coefficient or
factorial. Here’s what happens with 4 and 5 elements in the codomain.

1.6. Advanced Counting Using PIE

Example 1.6.9

1. How many functions f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → {a, b, c, d} are surjective?
2. How many functions f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} → {a, b, c, d, e} are
surjective?
Solution.
1. There are 45 functions all together; we will subtract the functions which are not surjective. We could exclude any one of
the four elements of the codomain, and doing so will leave
us with 35 functions for each excluded element. This counts
too many so we subtract the functions which exclude two
of the four elements of the codomain, each pair giving 25
functions. But this excludes too many, so we add back in
the functions which exclude three of the four elements of
the codomain, each triple giving 15 function. There are 41

groups of functions excluding a single element, 42 groups

of functions excluding a pair of elements, and 43 groups of
functions excluding a triple of elements. This means that the
number of functions which are not surjective is:

We took the total number of functions 55 and subtracted all
that were not surjective. There were 51 ways to select a single
element from the codomain to exclude from the range, and
for each there were 45 functions. But this double counts, so
we use PIE and subtract functions
excluding two elements
5
from the range: there are 2 choices for the two elements to
exclude, and for each pair, 35 functions. This takes out too

122

1. Counting

many functions, so we add back in functions which exclude
3 elements from the range: 53 choices for which three to
exclude, and then 25 functions for each choice of elements.
Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4
elements for each of the 54 choices of 4 elements.
If you happen to calculate this number precisely, you will get
120 surjections. That happens to also be the value of 5!. This
might seem like an amazing coincidence until you realize that
every surjective function f : X → Y with |X|  |Y| finite must
necessarily be a bĳection. The number of bĳections is always
|X|! in this case. What we have here is a combinatorial proof of
the following identity:

We have seen that counting surjective functions is another nice example of the advanced use of the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion. Also,
counting injective functions turns out to be equivalent to permutations,
and counting all functions has a solution akin to those counting problems
where order matters but repeats are allowed (like counting the number
of words you can make from a given set of letters).
These are not just a few more examples of the techniques we have
developed in this chapter. Quite the opposite: everything we have learned
in this chapter are examples of counting functions!
Example 1.6.10

How many 5-letter words can you make using the eight letters a
through h? How many contain no repeated letters?
Solution. By now it should be no surprise that there are 85 words,
and P(8, 5) words without repeated letters. The new piece here is
that we are actually counting functions. For the first problem, we
are counting all functions from {1, 2, . . . , 5} to {a, b, . . . , h}. The
numbers in the domain represent the position of the letter in the
word, the codomain represents the letter that could be assigned to
that position. If we ask for no repeated letters, we are asking for
injective functions.
If A and B are any sets with |A|  5 and |B|  8, then the
number of functions f : A → B is 85 and the number of injections
is P(8, 5). So if you can represent your counting problem as a
function counting problem, most of the work is done.

1.6. Advanced Counting Using PIE

123

Example 1.6.11

How many subsets are there of {1, 2, . . . , 9}? How many 9-bit
strings are there (of any weight)?
Solution. We saw in Section 1.2 that the answer to both these
questions is 29 , as we can say yes or no (or 0 or 1) to each of the 9
elements in the set (positions in the bit-string). But 29 also looks
like the answer you get from counting functions. In fact, if you
count all functions f : A → B with |A|  9 and |B|  2, this is
exactly what you get.
This makes sense! Let A  {1, 2, . . . , 9} and B  { y, n}. We
are assigning each element of the set either a yes or a no. Or in
the language of bit-strings, we would take the 9 positions in the bit
string as our domain and the set {0, 1} as the codomain.
So far we have not used a function as a model for binomial coefficients
(combinations). Think for a moment about the relationship
between
9
combinations and permutations, say specifically 3 and P(9, 3). We do
have a function model for P(9, 3). This is the number of injective functions
from a set of size 3 (say {1, 2, 3} to a set of size 9 (say {1, 2, . . . , 9}) since
there are 9 choices for where to send the first element of the domain, then
only 8 choices for the second, and 7 choices for the third. For example,
the function might look like this:
f (1)  5

f (2)  8

f (3)  4.

This is a different function from:
f (1)  4

f (2)  5

f (3)  8.

Now P(9, 3) counts these as different outcomes correctly, but 93 will
count these
(among others) as just one outcome. In fact, in terms of func9
tions 3 just counts the number of different ranges possible of injective
functions. This should not be a surprise since binomial coefficients counts
subsets, and the range is a possible subset of the codomain.3
While it is possible to interpret combinations as functions, perhaps
the better advice is to instead use combinations (or stars and bars) when
functions are not quite the right way to interpret the counting question.



3A more mathematically sophisticated interpretation of combinations is that we are
defining two injective functions to be equivalent if they have the same range, and then
counting the number of equivalence classes under this notion of equivalence.

With all the different counting techniques we have mastered in this
last chapter, it might be difficult to know when to apply which technique.
Indeed, it is very easy to get mixed up and use the wrong counting method
for a given problem. You get better with practice. As you practice you
start to notice some trends that can help you distinguish between types
of counting problems. Here are some suggestions that you might find
helpful when deciding how to tackle a counting problem and checking
whether your solution is correct.
• Remember that you are counting the number of items in some list
of outcomes. Write down part of this list. Write down an element in
the middle of the list – how are you deciding whether your element

128

1. Counting

really is in the list. Could you get this element more than once using
your proposed answer?
• If generating an element on the list involves selecting something (for
example, picking a letter or picking a position to put a letter, etc),
can the things you select be repeated? Remember, permutations
and combinations select objects from a set without repeats.
• Does order matter? Be careful here and be sure you know what
your answer really means. We usually say that order matters when
you get different outcomes when the same objects are selected in
different orders. Combinations and “Stars & Bars” are used when
order does not matter.
• There are four possibilities when it comes to order and repeats. If
order matters and repeats are allowed, the answer will look like n k .
If order matters and repeats are not allowed, we have P(n, k). If
order doesn’t matter and repeats are allowed, use stars and
 bars. If
order doesn’t matter and repeats are not allowed, use nk . But be
careful: this only applies when you are selecting things, and you
should make sure you know exactly what you are selecting before
determining which case you are in.
• Think about how you would represent your counting problem in
terms of sets or functions. We know how to count different sorts of
sets and different types of functions.
• As we saw with combinatorial proofs, you can often solve a counting problem in more than one way. Do that, and compare your
numerical answers. If they don’t match, something is amiss.
While we have covered many counting techniques, we have really
only scratched the surface of the large subject of enumerative combinatorics.
There are mathematicians doing original research in this area even as you
read this. Counting can be really hard.
In the next chapter, we will approach counting questions from a very
different direction, and in doing so, answer infinitely many counting
questions at the same time. We will create sequences of answers to related
questions.

Investigate!
There is a monastery in Hanoi, as the legend goes, with a great
hall containing three tall pillars. Resting on the first pillar are 64
giant disks (or washers), all different sizes, stacked from largest
to smallest. The monks are charged with the following task: they
must move the entire stack of disks to the third pillar. However,
due to the size of the disks, the monks cannot move more than
one at a time. Each disk must be placed on one of the pillars
before the next disk is moved. And because the disks are so
heavy and fragile, the monks may never place a larger disk on top
of a smaller disk. When the monks finally complete their task,
the world shall come to an end. Your task: figure out how long
before we need to start worrying about the end of the world.

This puzzle is called the Tower of Hanoi. You are tasked with finding
the minimum number of moves to complete the puzzle. This certainly
sounds like a counting problem. Perhaps you have an answer? If not,
what else could we try?
The answer depends on the number of disks you need to move. In
fact, we could answer the puzzle first for 1 disk, then 2, then 3 and so on.
If we list out all of the answers for each number of disks, we will get a
sequence of numbers. The nth term in the sequence is the answer to the
question, “what is the smallest number of moves required to complete
the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with n disks?” You might wonder why we
would create such a sequence instead of just answering the question. By
looking at how the sequence of numbers grows, we gain insight into the
problem. It is easy to count the number of moves required for a small
number of disks. We can then look for a pattern among the first few terms
135

of the sequence. Hopefully this will suggest a method for finding the nth
term of the sequence, which is the answer to our question. Of course we
will also need to verify that our suspected pattern is correct, and that this
correct pattern really does give us the nth term we think it does, but it is
impossible to prove that your formula is correct without having a formula
to start with.
Sequences are also interesting mathematical objects to study in their
own right. Let’s see why.

Describing Sequences

Investigate!
You have a large collection of 1 × 1 squares and 1 × 2 dominoes.
You want to arrange these to make a 1 × 15 strip. How many ways
can you do this?
1. Start by collecting data. How many length 1 × 1 strips can
you make? How many 1 × 2 strips? How many 1 × 3 strips?
And so on.
2. How are the 1 × 3 and 1 × 4 strips related to the 1 × 5 strips?
3. How many 1 × 15 strips can you make?
4. What if I asked you to find the number of 1 × 1000 strips?
Would the method you used to calculate the number fo 1×15
strips be helpful?

A sequence is simply an ordered list of numbers. For example, here
is a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . . This is different from the set N because,
while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural
numbers, in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers
come in. For this reason, when we use variables to represent terms in a
sequence they will look like this:
a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . .
To refer to the entire sequence at once, we will write (a n )n∈N or (a n )n≥0 , or
sometimes if we are being sloppy, just (a n ) (in which case we assume we
start the sequence with a 0 ).
We might replace the a with another letter, and sometimes we omit
a 0 , starting with a1 , in which case we would use (a n )n≥1 to refer to the

2.1. Describing Sequences

137

sequence as a whole. The numbers in the subscripts are called indices
(the plural of index).
While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers, it
is really a type of function. Specifically, the sequence (a n )n≥0 is a function
with domain N where a n is the image of the natural number n. Later we
will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated
functions in algebra or calculus. We can shift a sequence up or down,
add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence. These are
done exactly as you would for functions.
That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind
is helpful, we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.
Example 2.1.1

Can you find the next term in the following sequences?
1. 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, . . .
2. 3, −3, 3, −3, 3, . . .
3. 1, 5, 2, 10, 3, 15, . . .
4. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . .
5. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . .
6. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . .
7. 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . .
8. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, . . .
9. 3, 2, 1, 0, −1, . . .
10. 1, 1, 2, 6, . . .
Solution. No you cannot. You might guess that the next terms are:
1. 7

4. 64

7. 28

2. −3

5. 49

8. 17

3. 4

6. 34

9. −2

10. 24

In fact, those are the next terms of the sequences I had in mind
when I made up the example, but there is no way to be sure they
are correct.
Still, we will often do this. Given the first few terms of a sequence, we can ask what the pattern in the sequence suggests the
next terms are.

138

2. Sequences

Given that no number of initial terms in a sequence is enough to say
for certain which sequence we are dealing with, we need to find another
way to specify a sequence. We consider two ways to do this:
Closed formula.
A closed formula for a sequence (a n )n∈N is a formula for a n using a
fixed finite number of operations on n. This is what you normally
think of as a formula in n, just as if you were defining a function in
terms of n (because that is exactly what you are doing).
Recursive definition.
A recursive definition (sometimes called an inductive definition)
for a sequence (a n )n∈N consists of a recurrence relation : an equation relating a term of the sequence to previous terms (terms with
smaller index) and an initial condition: a list of a few terms of
the sequence (one less than the number of terms in the recurrence
relation).
It is easier to understand what is going on here with an example:
Example 2.1.2

Here are a few closed formulas for sequences:
• an  n2.
• an 

n(n + 1)
.
2


• an 

√ n
1+ 5
2

−



√  −n
1+ 5

.

Note in each formula, if you are given n, you can calculate a n
directly: just plug in n. For example, to find a 3 in the second
3(3+1)
sequence, just compute a 3  2  6.
Here are a few recursive definitions for sequences:
• a n  2a n−1 with a 0  1.
• a n  2a n−1 with a 0  27.
• a n  a n−1 + a n−2 with a 0  0 and a 1  1.
In these formulas, if you are given n, you cannot calculate a n
directly, you first need to find a n−1 (or a n−1 and a n−2 ). In the second
sequence, to find a 3 you would take 2a 2 , but to find a 2  2a1 we
would need to know a 1  2a 0 . We do know this, so we could trace

2.1. Describing Sequences

139

back through these equations to find a 1  54, a 2  108 and finally
a 3  216.
You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions
for sequences. After all, it is harder to find a n with a recursive definition
than with a closed formula. This is true, but it is also harder to find a
closed formula for a sequence than it is to find a recursive definition. So to
find a useful closed formula, we might first find the recursive definition,
then use that to find the closed formula.
This is not to say that recursive definitions aren’t useful in finding a n .
You can always calculate a n given a recursive definition, it might just take
a while.
Example 2.1.3

Find a 6 in the sequence defined by a n  2a n−1 − a n−2 with a0  3
and a 1  4.
Solution. We know that a 6  2a 5 − a4 . So to find a 6 we need to find
a 5 and a 4 . Well
a 5  2a 4 − a 3

and

a 4  2a 3 − a 2 ,

so if we can only find a 3 and a 2 we would be set. Of course
a 3  2a 2 − a 1

and

a2  2a 1 − a 0 ,

so we only need to find a1 and a0 . But we are given these. Thus
a0  3
a1  4
a2  2 · 4 − 3  5
a3  2 · 5 − 4  6
a4  2 · 6 − 5  7
a5  2 · 7 − 6  8
a 6  2 · 8 − 7  9.
Note that now we can guess a closed formula for the nth term
of the sequence: a n  n + 3. To be sure this will always work, we
could plug in this formula into the recurrence relation:
2a n−1 − a n−2  2((n − 1) + 3) − ((n − 2) + 3)
 2n + 4 − n − 1
 n + 3  an .

140

2. Sequences

That is not quite enough though, since there can be multiple
closed formulas that satisfy the same recurrence relation; we must
also check that our closed formula agrees on the initial terms of the
sequence. Since a 0  0 + 3  3 and a 1  1 + 3  4 are the correct
initial conditions, we can now conclude we have the correct closed
formula.
Finding closed formulas, or even recursive definitions, for sequences
is not trivial. There is no one method for doing this. Just as in evaluating
integrals or solving differential equations, it is useful to have a bag of
tricks you can apply, but sometimes there is no easy answer.
One useful method is to relate a given sequence to another sequence
for which we already know the closed formula. To do this, we need a
few “known sequences” to compare mystery sequences to. Here are a
few that are good to know. We will verify the formulas for these in the
coming sections.
Common Sequences.
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . .
The square numbers. The sequence (s n )n≥1 has closed formula s n  n 2
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . .
The triangular numbers. The sequence (Tn )n≥1 has closed
n(n+1)
formula Tn  2 .
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . .
The powers of 2. The sequence (a n )n≥0 with closed formula
a n  2n .
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . .
The Fibonacci numbers (or Fibonacci sequence), defined
recursively by Fn  Fn−1 + Fn−2 with F1  F2  1
Example 2.1.4

Use the formulas Tn  2 and a n  2n to find closed formulas
that agree with the following sequences. Assume each first term
corresponds to n  0.
n(n+1)

1. (b n ): 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, . . ..
2. (c n ): 3, 5, 9, 17, 33, . . ..

2.1. Describing Sequences

141

3. (d n ): 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, . . ..
4. (e n ): 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, . . ..
5. ( f n ): 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . ..
6. (g n ) 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, . . ..
7. (h n ): 6, 10, 18, 34, 66, . . ..
8. ( jn ): 15, 33, 57, 87, 123, . . ..
Solution. We wish to compare these sequences to the triangular
numbers (0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . .), when we start with n  0, and
the powers of 2: (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .).
1. (1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, . . .). Note that if subtract 1 from each
term, we get the sequence (Tn ). So we have b n  Tn + 1.
n(n+1)
Therefore a closed formula is b n  2 + 1. A quick check
of the first few n confirms we have it right.
2. (3, 5, 9, 17, 33, . . .). Each term in this sequence is one more
than a power of 2, so we might guess the closed formula is
c n  a n +1  2n +1. If we try this though, we get c0  20 +1  2
and c1  21 + 1  3. We are off because the indices are shifted.
What we really want is c n  a n+1 + 1 giving c n  2n+1 + 1.
3. (0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, . . .). Notice that all these terms are even.
What happens if we factor out a 2? We get (Tn )! More
precisely, we find that d n /2  Tn , so this sequence has closed
formula d n  n(n + 1).
4. (3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, . . .). These are all triangular numbers.
However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead
of as our third term. So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into
the formula for Tn , we would be set. Therefore the closed
(n+2)(n+3)
(where n + 3 came from (n + 2) + 1).
formula is e n 
2
Thinking about sequences as functions, we are doing a horizontal shift by 2: e n  Tn+2 which would cause the graph to
shift 2 units to the left.
5. (0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . .). Try adding 1 to each term and we get
powers of 2. You might guess this because each term is a
little more than twice the previous term (the powers of 2 are
exactly twice the previous term). Closed formula: f n  2n − 1.
6. (3, 6, 12, 24, 48, . . .). These numbers are also doubling each
time, but are also all multiples of 3. Dividing each by 3 gives
1, 2, 4, 8, . . . . Aha. We get the closed formula g n  3 · 2n .

142

2. Sequences

7. (6, 10, 18, 34, 66, . . .). To get from one term to the next, we
almost double each term. So maybe we can relate this back
to 2n . Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2. So we get
h n  2n+2 + 2 (the n + 2 is because the first term is 2 more than
22 , not 20 ). Alternatively, we could have related this sequence
to the second sequence in this example: starting with 3, 5, 9,
17, . . . we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that
sequence. That sequence had closed formula c n  2n+1 + 1.
Our sequence here would be twice this, so h n  2(2n + 1),
which is the same as we got before.
8. (15, 33, 57, 87, 123, . . .). Try dividing each term by 3. That
gives the sequence 5, 11, 19, 29, 41, . . .. Now add 1 to each
term: 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, . . ., which is (d n ) in this example, except
starting with 6 instead of 0. So let’s start with the formula
d n  n(n + 1). To start with the 6, we shift: (n + 2)(n + 3).
But this is one too many, so subtract 1: (n + 2)(n + 3) − 1.
That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3. So we want
jn  3((n + 2)(n + 3) − 1).
Partial sums.
Some sequences naturally arise as the sum of terms of another sequence.
Example 2.1.5

Sam keeps track of how many push-ups she does each day of her
“do lots of push-ups challenge.” Let (a n )n≥1 be the sequence that
describes the number of push-ups done on the nth day of the
challenge. The sequence starts
3, 5, 6, 10, 9, 0, 12, . . . .
Describe a sequence (b n )n≥1 that describes the total number of
push-ups done by Sam after the nth day.
Solution. We can find the terms of this sequence easily enough.
3, 8, 14, 24, 33, 33, 45, . . . .
Here b1 is just a 1 , but then
b2  3 + 5  a1 + a2 ,
b3  3 + 5 + 6  a1 + a2 + a3 ,

2.1. Describing Sequences

143

and so on.
There are a few ways we might describe b n in general. We could
do so recursively as,
b n  b n−1 + a n ,
since the total number of push-ups done after n days will be the
number done after n − 1 days, plus the number done on day n.
For something closer to a closed formula, we could write
b n  a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + a n ,
or the same thing using summation notation:
bn 

n
Õ

ai .

i1

However, note that these are not really closed formulas since even if
we had a formula for a n , we would still have an increasing number
of computations to do as n increases.
Given any sequence (a n )n∈N , we can always form a new sequence
(b n )n∈N by
b n  a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + a n .
Since the terms of (b n ) are the sums of the initial part of the sequence (a n )
ways call (b n ) the sequence of partial sums of (a n ). Soon we will see that
it is sometimes possible to find a closed formula for (b n ) from the closed
formula for (a n ).
To simplify writing out these sums, we will often use notation like
n
Õ

a k . This means add up the a k ’s where k changes from 1 to n.

cross (no lines are parallel) and no three lines cross at the same point.

16. A ternary string is a sequence of 0’s, 1’s and 2’s. Just like a bit string,
but with three symbols.
Let’s call a ternary string good provided it never contains a 2 followed immediately by a 0. Let G n be the number of good strings of
length n. For example, G1  3, and G2  8 (since of the 9 ternary
strings of length 2, only one is not good).

We now turn to the question of finding closed formulas for particular
types of sequences.
Arithmetic Sequences.
If the terms of a sequence differ by a constant, we say the sequence
is arithmetic. If the initial term (a 0 ) of the sequence is a and the
common difference is d, then we have,
Recursive definition: a n  a n−1 + d with a 0  a.
Closed formula: a n  a + dn.
How do we know this? For the recursive definition, we need to specify
a 0 . Then we need to express a n in terms of a n−1 . If we call the first term a,
then a 0  a. For the recurrence relation, by the definition of an arithmetic
sequence, the difference between successive terms is some constant, say
d. So a n − a n−1  d, or in other words,
a0  a

a n  a n−1 + d.

2.2. Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences

149

To find a closed formula, first write out the sequence in general:
a0  a
a1  a0 + d  a + d
a 2  a 1 + d  a + d + d  a + 2d
a 3  a 2 + d  a + 2d + d  a + 3d
..
.
We see that to find the nth term, we need to start with a and then add
d a bunch of times. In fact, add it n times. Thus a n  a + dn.
Example 2.2.1

Find recursive definitions and closed formulas for the arithmetic
sequences below. Assume the first term listed is a 0 .
1. 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, . . ..
2. 50, 43, 36, 29, . . ..
Solution. First we should check that these sequences really are
arithmetic by taking differences of successive terms. Doing so will
reveal the common difference d.
1. 5 − 2  3, 8 − 5  3, etc. To get from each term to the next,
we add three, so d  3. The recursive definition is therefore
a n  a n−1 + 3 with a 0  2. The closed formula is a n  2 + 3n.
2. Here the common difference is −7, since we add −7 to 50
to get 43, and so on. Thus we have a recursive definition of
a n  a n−1 − 7 with a 0  50. The closed formula is a n  50 − 7n.
What about sequences like 2, 6, 18, 54, . . .? This is not arithmetic because the difference between terms is not constant. However, the ratio
between successive terms is constant. We call such sequences geometric.
The recursive definition for the geometric sequence with initial term
a and common ratio r is a n  a n−1 · r; a 0  a. To get the next term we
multiply the previous term by r. We can find the closed formula like we
did for the arithmetic progression. Write
a0  a
a1  a0 · r
a2  a1 · r  a0 · r · r  a0 · r 2

150

2. Sequences

..
.
We must multiply the first term a by r a number of times, n times to be
precise. We get a n  a · r n .
Geometric Sequences.
A sequence is called geometric if the ratio between successive terms
is constant. Suppose the initial term a 0 is a and the common ratio
is r. Then we have,
Recursive definition: a n  ra n−1 with a 0  a.
Closed formula: a n  a · r n .
Example 2.2.2

Find the recursive and closed formula for the geometric sequences
below. Again, the first term listed is a 0 .
1. 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, . . .
2. 27, 9, 3, 1, 1/3, . . .
Solution. Start by checking that these sequences really are geometric by dividing each term by its previous term. If this ratio really is
constant, we will have found r.
1. 6/3  2, 12/6  2, 24/12  2, etc. Yes, to get from any term to
the next, we multiply by r  2. So the recursive definition is
a n  2a n−1 with a 0  3. The closed formula is a n  3 · 2n .
2. The common ratio is r  1/3. So the sequence has recursive
definition a n  31 a n−1 with a 0  27 and closed formula a n 
n
27 · 31 .
In the examples and formulas above, we assumed that the initial term
was a 0 . If your sequence starts with a 1 , you can easily find the term that
would have been a 0 and use that in the formula. For example, if we want
a formula for the sequence 2, 5, 8, . . . and insist that 2  a 1 , then we can
find a 0  −1 (since the sequence is arithmetic with common difference 3,
we have a 0 + 3  a 1 ). Then the closed formula will be a n  −1 + 3n.
Remark 2.2.3 If you look at other textbooks or online, you might find
that their closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences differ
from ours. Specifically, you might find the formulas a n  a + (n − 1)d
(arithmetic) and a n  a · r n−1 (geometric). Which is correct? Both! In our
case, we take a to be a 0 . If instead we had a 1 as our initial term, we would
get the (slightly more complicated) formulas you find elsewhere.

Look at the sequence (Tn )n≥1 which starts 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, . . .. These are
called the triangular numbers since they represent the number of dots in
an equilateral triangle (think of how you arrange 10 bowling pins: a row
of 4 plus a row of 3 plus a row of 2 and a row of 1).

T1  1

T2  3

T3  6

T4  10

Is this sequence arithmetic? No, since 3 − 1  2 and 6 − 3  3 , 2, so
there is no common difference. Is the sequence geometric? No. 3/1  3
but 6/3  2, so there is no common ratio. What to do?
Notice that the differences between terms do form an arithmetic sequence: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .. This means that the nth term of the sequence (Tn )
is the sum of the first n terms in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .. We say that

152

2. Sequences

(Tn ) is the sequence of partial sums of the sequence 1, 2, 3, . . . (partial
sums because we are not taking the sum of all infinitely many terms).
This should become clearer if we write the triangular numbers like
this:
11
31+2
61+2+3
10  1 + 2 + 3 + 4
..
..
.
.
Tn  1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n.
If we know how to add up the terms of an arithmetic sequence, we
could find a closed formula for a sequence whose differences are the
terms of that arithmetic sequence. Consider how we could find the sum
of the first 100 positive integers (that is, T100 ). Instead of adding them in
order, we regroup and add 1 + 100  101. The next pair to combine is
2 + 99  101. Then 3 + 98  101. Keep going. This gives 50 pairs which
each add up to 101, so T100  101 · 50  5050.1
n(n+1)
In general, using this same sort of regrouping, we find that Tn  2 .

Incidentally, this is exactly the same as n+1
2 , which makes sense if you
think of the triangular numbers as counting the number of handshakes
that take place at a party with n + 1 people: the first person shakes n
hands, the next shakes an additional n − 1 hands and so on.
The point of all of this is that some sequences, while not arithmetic
or geometric, can be interpreted as the sequence of partial sums of arithmetic and geometric sequences. Luckily there are methods we can use to
compute these sums quickly.
Summing Arithmetic Sequences: Reverse and Add
Here is a technique that allows us to quickly find the sum of an arithmetic
sequence.
Example 2.2.4

Find the sum: 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + · · · + 470.
Solution. The idea is to mimic how we found the formula for
triangular numbers. If we add the first and last terms, we get 472.
1This insight is usually attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, who discovered it as a child when his unpleasant elementary teacher
thought he would keep the class busy by requiring them to compute the lengthy sum.

2.2. Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences

153

The second term and second-to-last term also add up to 472. To
keep track of everything, we might express this as follows. Call the
sum S. Then,
S

2S 

470
2
472

To find 2S then we add 472 to itself a number of times. What
number? We need to decide how many terms (summands) are in
the sum. Since the terms form an arithmetic sequence, the nth term
in the sum (counting 2 as the 0th term) can be expressed as 2 + 3n.
If 2 + 3n  470 then n  156. So n ranges from 0 to 156, giving 157
terms in the sum. This is the number of 472’s in the sum for 2S.
Thus
2S  157 · 472  74104.
It is now easy to find S:
S  74104/2  37052.
This will work for the sum of any arithmetic sequence. Call the sum
S. Reverse and add. This produces a single number added to itself many
times. Find the number of times. Multiply. Divide by 2. Done.
Example 2.2.5

Find a closed formula for 6 + 10 + 14 + · · · + (4n − 2).
Solution. Again, we have a sum of an arithmetic sequence. How
many terms are in the sequence? Clearly each term in the sequence
has the form 4k − 2 (as evidenced by the last term). For which
values of k though? To get 6, k  2. To get 4n − 2 take k  n. So to
find the number of terms, we must count the number of integers in
the range 2, 3, . . . , n. This is n − 1. (There are n numbers from 1 to
n, so one less if we start with 2.)
Now reverse and add:
+

S
S
2S 

4n − 2
4n + 4

4n − 6

+···+
+···+
+···+

4n − 6
10
4n + 4

+
+
+

4n − 2
6
4n + 4

Since there are n − 1 terms, we get
2S  (n − 1)(4n + 4)

so

S

(n − 1)(4n + 4)
.

154

2. Sequences

Besides finding sums, we can use this technique to find closed formulas for sequences we recognize as sequences of partial sums.
Example 2.2.6

Use partial sums to find a closed formula for (a n )n≥0 which starts
2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37, . . . . . .
Solution. First, if you look at the differences between terms, you get
a sequence of differences: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, . . ., which is an arithmetic
sequence. Written another way:
a0  2
a1  2 + 1
a2  2 + 1 + 4
a3  2 + 1 + 4 + 7
and so on. We can write the general term of (a n ) in terms of the
arithmetic sequence as follows:
a n  2 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + · · · + (1 + 3(n − 1))
(we use 1 + 3(n − 1) instead of 1 + 3n to get the indices to line up
correctly; for a 3 we add up to 7, which is 1 + 3(3 − 1)).
We can reverse and add, but the initial 2 does not fit our pattern.
This just means we need to keep the 2 out of the reverse part:
+

2 + 3(n − 1)

+···+
+···+
+···+

1 + 3(n − 1)
1
2 + 3(n − 1)

Not counting the first term (the 4) there are n summands of
2 + 3(n − 1)  3n − 1 so the right-hand side becomes 4 + (3n − 1)n.
Finally, solving for a n we get
an 

4 + (3n − 1)n
.

Just to be sure, we check a0 

Summing Geometric Sequences: Multiply, Shift and Subtract
To find the sum of a geometric sequence, we cannot just reverse and add.
Do you see why? The reason we got the same term added to itself many
times is because there was a constant difference. So as we added that
difference in one direction, we subtracted the difference going the other

2.2. Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences

155

way, leaving a constant total. For geometric sums, we have a different
technique.
Example 2.2.7

What is 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + · · · + 12288?
Solution. Multiply each term by 2, the common ratio. You get
2S  6 + 12 + 24 + · · · + 24576. Now subtract: 2S − S  −3 + 24576 
24573. Since 2S − S  S, we have our answer.
To better see what happened in the above example, try writing it this
way:
3+

S
2S 
−S 

−

6 + 12 + 24 + · · · + 12288
6 + 12 + 24 + · · · + 12288
0+0+0+···+0

3+

+24576
−24576

Then divide both sides by −1 and we have the same result for S. The
idea is, by multiplying the sum by the common ratio, each term becomes
the next term. We shift over the sum to get the subtraction to mostly
cancel out, leaving just the first term and new last term.
Example 2.2.8

Find a closed formula for S(n)  2 + 10 + 50 + · · · + 2 · 5n .
Solution. The common ratio is 5. So we have
−

Thus S 

Even though this might seem like a new technique, you have probably
used it before.
Example 2.2.9

Express 0.464646 . . . as a fraction.
Solution. Let N  0.46464646 . . .. Consider 0.01N. We get:

So N  99
. What have we done? We viewed the repeating decimal 0.464646 . . . as a sum of the geometric sequence 0.46, 0.0046, 0.000046, . . .
The common ratio is 0.01. The only real difference is that we are
now computing an infinite geometric sum, we do not have the extra
“last” term to consider. Really, this is the result of taking a limit as
you would in calculus when you compute infinite geometric sums.

So far we have seen methods for finding the closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences. Since we know how to compute the
sum of the first n terms of arithmetic and geometric sequences, we can
compute the closed formulas for sequences which have an arithmetic (or
geometric) sequence of differences between terms. But what if we consider a sequence which is the sum of the first n terms of a sequence which
is itself the sum of an arithmetic sequence?
Before we get too carried away, let’s consider an example: How many
squares (of all sizes) are there on a chessboard? A chessboard consists of
64 squares, but we also want to consider squares of longer side length.
Even though we are only considering an 8 × 8 board, there is already a
lot to count. So instead, let us build a sequence: the first term will be the
number of squares on a 1 × 1 board, the second term will be the number
of squares on a 2 × 2 board, and so on. After a little thought, we arrive at
the sequence
1, 5, 14, 30, 55, . . . .
This sequence is not arithmetic (or geometric for that matter), but
perhaps it’s sequence of differences is. For differences we get
4, 9, 16, 25, . . . .
Not a huge surprise: one way to count the number of squares in a 4 × 4
chessboard is to notice that there are 16 squares with side length 1, 9 with
side length 2, 4 with side length 3 and 1 with side length 4. So the original
sequence is just the sum of squares. Now this sequence of differences
is not arithmetic since it’s sequence of differences (the differences of the
differences of the original sequence) is not constant. In fact, this sequence
of second differences is
5, 7, 9, . . . ,
which is an arithmetic sequence (with constant difference 2). Notice
that our original sequence had third differences (that is, differences of
differences of differences of the original) constant. We will call such a

2.3. Polynomial Fitting

161

sequence ∆3 -constant. The sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . has second differences
constant, so it will be a ∆2 -constant sequence. In general, we will say a
sequence is a ∆k -constant sequence if the kth differences are constant.
Example 2.3.1

Which of the following sequences are ∆k -constant for some value
of k?
1. 2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37, . . ..
2. 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, . . ..
3. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, . . ..
Solution.
1. This is the sequence from Example 2.2.6, in which we found a
closed formula by recognizing the sequence as the sequence
of partial sums of an arithmetic sequence. Indeed, the sequence of first differences is 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, . . ., which itself has
differences 3, 3, 3, 3, . . .. Thus 2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37, . . . is a ∆2 constant sequence.
2. These are the perfect cubes. The sequence of first differences
is 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, . . .; the sequence of second differences is
12, 18, 24, 30, . . .; the sequence of third differences is constant:
6, 6, 6, . . .. Thus the perfect cubes are a ∆3 -constant sequence.
3. If we take first differences we get 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .. Wait, what?
That’s the sequence we started with. So taking second differences will give us the same sequence again. No matter how
many times we repeat this we will always have the same sequence, which in particular means no finite number of differences will be constant. Thus this sequence is not ∆k -constant
for any k.
The ∆0 -constant sequences are themselves constant, so a closed formula for them is easy to compute (it’s just the constant). The ∆1 -constant
sequences are arithmetic and we have a method for finding closed formulas for them as well. Every ∆2 -constant sequence is the sum of an
arithmetic sequence so we can find formulas for these as well. But notice that the format of the closed formula for a ∆2 -constant sequence is
always quadratic. For example, the square numbers are ∆2 -constant with
closed formula a n  n 2 . The triangular numbers (also ∆2 -constant) have
n(n+1)
closed formula a n  2 , which when multiplied out gives you an n 2

term as well. It appears that every time we increase the complexity of the
sequence, that is, increase the number of differences before we get constants, we also increase the degree of the polynomial used for the closed
formula. We go from constant to linear to quadratic. The sequence of
differences between terms tells us something about the rate of growth of
the sequence. If a sequence is growing at a constant rate, then the formula
for the sequence will be linear. If the sequence is growing at a rate which
itself is growing at a constant rate, then the formula is quadratic. You
have seen this elsewhere: if a function has a constant second derivative
(rate of change) then the function must be quadratic.
This works in general:
Finite Differences.
The closed formula for a sequence will be a degree k polynomial
if and only if the sequence is ∆k -constant (i.e., the kth sequence of
differences is constant).
This tells us that the sequence of numbers of squares on a chessboard,
1, 5, 14, 30, 55, . . ., which we saw to be ∆3 -constant, will have a cubic (degree 3 polynomial) for its closed formula.
Now once we know what format the closed formula for a sequence
will take, it is much easier to actually find the closed formula. In the case
that the closed formula is a degree k polynomial, we just need k + 1 data
points to “fit” the polynomial to the data.
Example 2.3.2

Find a formula for the sequence 3, 7, 14, 24, . . .. Assume a 1  3.
Solution. First, check to see if the formula has constant differences
at some level. The sequence of first differences is 4, 7, 10, . . . which
is arithmetic, so the sequence of second differences is constant. The
sequence is ∆2 -constant, so the formula for a n will be a degree 2
polynomial. That is, we know that for some constants a, b, and c,
a n  an 2 + bn + c.
Now to find a, b, and c. First, it would be nice to know what
a 0 is, since plugging in n  0 simplifies the above formula greatly.
In this case, a 0  2 (work backwards from the sequence of constant
differences). Thus
a 0  2  a · 02 + b · 0 + c,
so c  2. Now plug in n  1 and n  2. We get
a1  3  a + b + 2

2.3. Polynomial Fitting

163

a 2  7  a4 + b2 + 2.
At this point we have two (linear) equations and two unknowns,
so we can solve the system for a and b (using substitution or
elimination or even matrices). We find a  32 and b  −1
2 , so
a n  32 n 2 − 12 n + 2.
Example 2.3.3

Find a closed formula for the number of squares on an n × n chessboard.
Solution. We have seen that the sequence 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, . . . is ∆3 constant, so we are looking for a degree 3 polynomial. That is,
a n  an 3 + bn 2 + cn + d.
We can find d if we know what a 0 is. Working backwards from
the third differences, we find a 0  0 (unsurprisingly, since there are
no squares on a 0 × 0 chessboard). Thus d  0. Now plug in n  1,
n  2, and n  3:
1 a + b + c
5 8a + 4b + 2c
14 27a + 9b + 3c.
If we solve this system of equations we get a  31 , b  12 and
c  61 . Therefore the number of squares on an n × n chessboard is
a n  31 n 3 + 12 n 2 + 16 n  61 n(n + 1)(2n + 1).
Note: Since the squares-on-a-chessboard problem is really asking for
the sum of squares, we now have a nice formula for

Not all sequences will have polynomials as their closed formula. We
can use the theory of finite differences to identify these.

2. Sequences

3. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . .
Solution.
1. As we saw in Example 2.3.1, this sequence is not ∆k -constant
for any k. Therefore the closed formula for the sequence is
not a polynomial. In fact, we know the closed formula is
a n  2n , which grows faster than any polynomial (so is not a
polynomial).
2. The sequence of first differences is 7, 43, 133, 301, 571, . . .. The
second differences are: 36, 90, 168, 270, . . .. Third difference:
54, 78, 102, . . .. Fourth differences: 24, 24, . . .. As far as we can
tell, this sequence of differences is constant so the sequence
is ∆4 -constant and as such the closed formula is a degree 4
polynomial.
3. This is the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence of first differences is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . ., the sequence of second differences
are 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 . . .. We notice that after the first few terms,
we get the original sequence back. So there will never be
constant differences, so the closed formula for the Fibonacci
sequence is not a polynomial.

Attempt the above activity before proceeding

We have seen that it is often easier to find recursive definitions than
closed formulas. Lucky for us, there are a few techniques for converting
recursive definitions to closed formulas. Doing so is called solving a
recurrence relation. Recall that the recurrence relation is a recursive
definition without the initial conditions. For example, the recurrence
relation for the Fibonacci sequence is Fn  Fn−1 + Fn−2 . (This, together
with the initial conditions F0  0 and F1  1 give the entire recursive
definition for the sequence.)
Example 2.4.1

Find a recurrence relation and initial conditions for 1, 5, 17, 53, 161, 485 . . ..
Solution. Finding the recurrence relation would be easier if we had
some context for the problem (like the Tower of Hanoi, for example). Alas, we have only the sequence. Remember, the recurrence
relation tells you how to get from previous terms to future terms.
What is going on here? We could look at the differences between
terms: 4, 12, 36, 108, . . .. Notice that these are growing by a factor
of 3. Is the original sequence as well? 1 · 3  3, 5 · 3  15, 17 · 3  51
and so on. It appears that we always end up with 2 less than the
next term. Aha!
So a n  3a n−1 + 2 is our recurrence relation and the initial
condition is a 0  1.
We are going to try to solve these recurrence relations. By this we mean
something very similar to solving differential equations: we want to find
a function of n (a closed formula) which satisfies the recurrence relation,

168

2. Sequences

as well as the initial condition.2 Just like for differential equations, finding
a solution might be tricky, but checking that the solution is correct is easy.
Example 2.4.2

Check that a n  2n + 1 is a solution to the recurrence relation
a n  2a n−1 − 1 with a1  3.
Solution. First, it is easy to check the initial condition: a 1 should
be 21 + 1 according to our closed formula. Indeed, 21 + 1  3, which
is what we want. To check that our proposed solution satisfies the
recurrence relation, try plugging it in.
2a n−1 − 1  2(2n−1 + 1) − 1
 2n + 2 − 1
 2n + 1
 an .
That’s what our recurrence relation says! We have a solution.
Sometimes we can be clever and solve a recurrence relation by inspection. We generate the sequence using the recurrence relation and keep
track of what we are doing so that we can see how to jump to finding just
the a n term. Here are two examples of how you might do that.
Telescoping refers to the phenomenon when many terms in a large
sum cancel out - so the sum “telescopes.” For example:
(2 − 1) + (3 − 2) + (4 − 3) + · · · + (100 − 99) + (101 − 100)  −1 + 101
because every third term looks like: 2 + −2  0, and then 3 + −3  0 and
so on.
We can use this behavior to solve recurrence relations. Here is an
example.
Example 2.4.3

Solve the recurrence relation a n  a n−1 + n with initial term a 0  4.
Solution. To get a feel for the recurrence relation, write out the
first few terms of the sequence: 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19, . . .. Look at the
difference between terms. a 1 − a 0  1 and a 2 − a 1  2 and so on.
The key thing here is that the difference between terms is n. We
can write this explicitly: a n − a n−1  n. Of course, we could have
2Recurrence relations are sometimes called difference equations since they can describe
the difference between terms and this highlights the relation to differential equations
further.

2.4. Solving Recurrence Relations

arrived at this conclusion directly from the recurrence relation by
subtracting a n−1 from both sides.
Now use this equation over and over again, changing n each
time:
a1 − a0  1
a2 − a1  2
a3 − a2  3
..
..
.
.
a n − a n−1  n.
Add all these equations together. On the right-hand side, we
get the sum 1+2+3+· · ·+n. We already know this can be simplified
n(n+1)
to 2 . What happens on the left-hand side? We get
(a 1 − a 0 ) + (a 2 − a1 ) + (a3 − a 2 ) + · · · (a n−1 − a n−2 ) + (a n − a n−1 ).
This sum telescopes. We are left with only the −a 0 from the
first equation and the a n from the last equation. Putting this all
n(n+1)
n(n+1)
together we have −a 0 + a n  2 or a n  2 + a 0 . But we know
that a 0  4. So the solution to the recurrence relation, subject to the
initial condition is
n(n + 1)
an 
+ 4.
2
(Now that we know that, we should notice that the sequence is
the result of adding 4 to each of the triangular numbers.)
The above example shows a way to solve recurrence relations of the
Í
form a n  a n−1 + f (n) where nk1 f (k) has a known closed formula. If
you rewrite the recurrence relation as a n − a n−1  f (n), and then add up
all the different equations with n ranging between 1 and n, the left-hand
Í
side will always give you a n − a 0 . The right-hand side will be nk1 f (k),
which is why we need to know the closed formula for that sum.
However, telescoping will not help us with a recursion such as a n 
3a n−1 +2 since the left-hand side will not telescope. You will have −3a n−1 ’s
but only one a n−1 . However, we can still be clever if we use iteration.
We have already seen an example of iteration when we found the
closed formula for arithmetic and geometric sequences. The idea is, we
iterate the process of finding the next term, starting with the known initial
condition, up until we have a n . Then we simplify. In the arithmetic
sequence example, we simplified by multiplying d by the number of times

170

2. Sequences

we add it to a when we get to a n , to get from a n  a + d + d + d + · · · + d
to a n  a + dn.
To see how this works, let’s go through the same example we used for
telescoping, but this time use iteration.
Example 2.4.4

Use iteration to solve the recurrence relation a n  a n−1 + n with
a 0  4.
Solution. Again, start by writing down the recurrence relation
when n  1. This time, don’t subtract the a n−1 terms to the other
side:
a 1  a 0 + 1.
get

Now a2  a 1 + 2, but we know what a 1 is. By substitution, we
a 2  (a 0 + 1) + 2.
Now go to a 3  a 2 + 3, using our known value of a 2 :
a 3  ((a 0 + 1) + 2) + 3.

We notice a pattern. Each time, we take the previous term and
add the current index. So
a n  ((((a 0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + · · · + n − 1) + n.
Regrouping terms, we notice that a n is just a 0 plus the sum of
the integers from 1 to n. So, since a 0  4,
an  4 +

n(n + 1)
.
2

Of course in this case we still needed to know formula for the sum of
1, . . . , n. Let’s try iteration with a sequence for which telescoping doesn’t
work.
Example 2.4.5

Solve the recurrence relation a n  3a n−1 + 2 subject to a 0  1.
Solution. Again, we iterate the recurrence relation, building up to
the index n.
a 1  3a 0 + 2
a 2  3(a 1 ) + 2  3(3a 0 + 2) + 2

a n  3(a n−1 ) + 2  3(3(3(3 · · · (3a 0 + 2) + 2) + 2) · · · + 2) + 2.
It is difficult to see what is happening here because we have to
distribute all those 3’s. Let’s try again, this time simplifying a bit
as we go.
a 1  3a 0 + 2
a 2  3(a 1 ) + 2  3(3a 0 + 2) + 2  32 a 0 + 2 · 3 + 2
a 3  3[a 2 ] + 2  3[32 a0 + 2 · 3 + 2] + 2  33 a 0 + 2 · 32 + 2 · 3 + 2

 3n a 0 + 2 · 3n−1 + 2 · 3n−2 + · · · + 2 · 3 + 2.
Now we simplify. a 0  1, so we have 3n + hstuffi. Note that all
the other terms have a 2 in them. In fact, we have a geometric sum
with first term 2 and common ratio 3. We have seen how to simplify
n
2 + 2 · 3 + 2 · 32 + · · · + 2 · 3n−1 . We get 2−2·3
which simplifies to
−2
3n − 1. Putting this together with the first 3n term gives our closed
formula:
a n  2 · 3n − 1.
Iteration can be messy, but when the recurrence relation only refers
to one previous term (and maybe some function of n) it can work well.
However, trying to iterate a recurrence relation such as a n  2a n−1 + 3a n−2
will be way too complicated. We would need to keep track of two sets
of previous terms, each of which were expressed by two previous terms,
and so on. The length of the formula would grow exponentially (double
each time, in fact). Luckily there happens to be a method for solving
recurrence relations which works very well on relations like this.

The Characteristic Root Technique
Suppose we want to solve a recurrence relation expressed as a combination
of the two previous terms, such as a n  a n−1 + 6a n−2 . In other words, we
want to find a function of n which satisfies a n − a n−1 − 6a n−2  0. Now
iteration is too complicated, but think just for a second what would happen
if we did iterate. In each step, we would, among other things, multiply a
previous iteration by 6. So our closed formula would include 6 multiplied

172

2. Sequences

some number of times. Thus it is reasonable to guess the solution will
contain parts that look geometric. Perhaps the solution will take the form
r n for some constant r.
The nice thing is, we know how to check whether a formula is actually
a solution to a recurrence relation: plug it in. What happens if we plug
in r n into the recursion above? We get
r n − r n−1 − 6r n−2  0.
Now solve for r:

r n−2 (r 2 − r − 6)  0,

so by factoring, r  −2 or r  3 (or r  0, although this does not help
us). This tells us that a n  (−2)n is a solution to the recurrence relation,
as is a n  3n . Which one is correct? They both are, unless we specify
initial conditions. Notice we could also have a n  (−2)n + 3n . Or a n 
7(−2)n + 4 · 3n . In fact, for any a and b, a n  a(−2)n + b3n is a solution (try
plugging this into the recurrence relation). To find the values of a and b,
use the initial conditions.
This points us in the direction of a more general technique for solving
recurrence relations. Notice we will always be able to factor out the r n−2
as we did above. So we really only care about the other part. We call this
other part the characteristic equation for the recurrence relation. We are
interested in finding the roots of the characteristic equation, which are
called (surprise) the characteristic roots.
Characteristic Roots.
Given a recurrence relation a n +αa n−1 +βa n−2  0, the characteristic
polynomial is
x 2 + αx + β
giving the characteristic equation:
x 2 + αx + β  0.
If r1 and r2 are two distinct roots of the characteristic polynomial
(i.e, solutions to the characteristic equation), then the solution to the
recurrence relation is
a n  ar1n + br2n ,
where a and b are constants determined by the initial conditions.

2.4. Solving Recurrence Relations

Example 2.4.6

Solve the recurrence relation a n  7a n−1 − 10a n−2 with a0  2 and
a 1  3.
Solution. Rewrite the recurrence relation a n − 7a n−1 + 10a n−2  0.
Now form the characteristic equation:
x 2 − 7x + 10  0
and solve for x:

(x − 2)(x − 5)  0

so x  2 and x  5 are the characteristic roots. We therefore know
that the solution to the recurrence relation will have the form
a n  a2n + b5n .
To find a and b, plug in n  0 and n  1 to get a system of two
equations with two unknowns:
2  a20 + b50  a + b
3  a21 + b51  2a + 5b

Perhaps the most famous recurrence relation is Fn  Fn−1 +Fn−2 , which
together with the initial conditions F0  0 and F1  1 defines the Fibonacci
sequence. But notice that this is precisely the type of recurrence relation
on which we can use the characteristic root technique. When you do, the
only thing that changes is that the characteristic equation does not factor,
so you need to use the quadratic formula to find the characteristic roots.
In fact, doing so gives the third most famous irrational number, ϕ, the
golden ratio.
Before leaving the characteristic root technique, we should think about
what might happen when you solve the characteristic equation. We have
an example above in which the characteristic polynomial has two distinct
roots. These roots can be integers, or perhaps irrational numbers (requiring the quadratic formula to find them). In these cases, we know what
the solution to the recurrence relation looks like.
However, it is possible for the characteristic polynomial to have only
one root. This can happen if the characteristic polynomial factors as

174

2. Sequences

(x − r)2 . It is still the case that r n would be a solution to the recurrence
relation, but we won’t be able to find solutions for all initial conditions
using the general form a n  ar1n + br2n , since we can’t distinguish between
r1n and r2n . We are in luck though:
Characteristic Root Technique for Repeated Roots.
Suppose the recurrence relation a n  αa n−1 + βa n−2 has a characteristic polynomial with only one root r. Then the solution to the
recurrence relation is
a n  ar n + bnr n
where a and b are constants determined by the initial conditions.
Notice the extra n in bnr n . This allows us to solve for the constants a
and b from the initial conditions.
Example 2.4.7

Solve the recurrence relation a n  6a n−1 − 9a n−2 with initial conditions a 0  1 and a 1  4.
Solution. The characteristic polynomial is x 2 − 6x + 9. We solve
the characteristic equation
x 2 − 6x + 9  0
by factoring:

(x − 3)2  0

so x  3 is the only characteristic root. Therefore we know that the
solution to the recurrence relation has the form
a n  a3n + bn3n
for some constants a and b. Now use the initial conditions:
a 0  1  a30 + b · 0 · 30  a
a 1  4  a · 3 + b · 1 · 3  3a + 3b.
Since a  1, we find that b 

2.4. Solving Recurrence Relations

Although we will not consider examples more complicated than these,
this characteristic root technique can be applied to much more complicated recurrence relations. For example, a n  2a n−1 + a n−2 − 3a n−3 has
characteristic polynomial x 3 − 2x 2 − x + 3. Assuming you see how to factor
such a degree 3 (or more) polynomial you can easily find the characteristic
roots and as such solve the recurrence relation (the solution would look
like a n  ar1n + br2n + cr3n if there were 3 distinct roots). It is also possible
that the characteristics roots are complex numbers.
However, the characteristic root technique is only useful for solving
recurrence relations in a particular form: a n is given as a linear combination of some number of previous terms. These recurrence relations
are called linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The “homogeneous” refers to the fact that there is no additional
term in the recurrence relation other than a multiple of a j terms. For
example, a n  2a n−1 + 1 is non-homogeneous because of the additional constant 1. There are general methods of solving such things, but we will not
consider them here, other than through the use of telescoping or iteration
described above.

Induction

Mathematical induction is a proof technique, not unlike direct proof or
proof by contradiction or combinatorial proof.3 In other words, induction
is a style of argument we use to convince ourselves and others that a mathematical statement is always true. Many mathematical statements can be
proved by simply explaining what they mean. Others are very difficult to
prove—in fact, there are relatively simple mathematical statements which
nobody yet knows how to prove. To facilitate the discovery of proofs, it is
important to be familiar with some standard styles of arguments. Induction is one such style. Let’s start with an example:

Stamps
Investigate!
You need to mail a package, but don’t yet know how much postage
you will need. You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5cent stamps. Which amounts of postage can you make exactly
using these stamps? Which amounts are impossible to make?

!

Attempt the above activity before proceeding

!

Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some amounts
of postage, and then figured out whether you could make that amount
using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps. Perhaps you did this in order: can
you make 1 cent of postage? Can you make 2 cents? 3 cents? And so on. If
this is what you did, you were actually answering a sequence of questions.
We have methods for dealing with sequences. Let’s see if that helps.
Actually, we will not make a sequence of questions, but rather a sequence of statements. Let P(n) be the statement “you can make n cents
of postage using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps.” Since for each value of n,
P(n) is a statement, it is either true or false. So if we form the sequence of
statements
P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), . . . ,
the sequence will consist of T’s (for true) and F’s (for false). In our
particular case the sequence starts
F, F, F, F, T, F, F, T, F, T, F, F, T, . . .
because P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) are all false (you cannot make 1, 2, 3, or 4
cents of postage) but P(5) is true (use one 5-cent stamp), and so on.
Let’s think a bit about how we could find the value of P(n) for some
specific n (the “value” will be either T or F). How did we find the value of
3You might or might not be familiar with these yet. We will consider these in Chapter 3.

178

2. Sequences

the nth term of a sequence of numbers? How did we find a n ? There were
two ways we could do this: either there was a closed formula for a n , so
we could plug in n into the formula and get our output value, or we had a
recursive definition for the sequence, so we could use the previous terms
of the sequence to compute the nth term. When dealing with sequences
of statements, we could use either of these techniques as well. Maybe
there is a way to use n itself to determine whether we can make n cents of
postage. That would be something like a closed formula. Or instead we
could use the previous terms in the sequence (of statements) to determine
whether we can make n cents of postage. That is, if we know the value
of P(n − 1), can we get from that to the value of P(n)? That would be
something like a recursive definition for the sequence. Remember, finding
recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed
formulas. The same is true here.
Suppose I told you that P(43) was true (it is). Can you determine from
this fact the value of P(44) (whether it true or false)? Yes you can. Even if
we don’t know how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent
stamps, we do know that there was some way to do it. What if that way
used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)? We could replace
those three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps (making 16 cents). The
total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way to make 44 cents, so
P(44) is true. Of course, we assumed that we had at least three 5-cent
stamps. What if we didn’t? Then we must have at least three 8-cent
stamps (making 24 cents). If we replace those three 8-cent stamps with
five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have bumped up our
total by 1 cent so we can make 44 cents, so P(44) is true.
Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents, just that we can,
on the basis that we can make 43 cents. How do we know we can make
43 cents? Perhaps because we know we can make 42 cents, which we
know we can do because we know we can make 41 cents, and so on.
It’s a recursion! As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence,
we must specify our initial value. In this case, the initial value is “P(1) is
false.” That’s not good, since our recurrence relation just says that P(k + 1)
is true if P(k) is also true. We need to start the process with a true P(k).
So instead, we might want to use “P(28) is true” as the initial condition.
Putting this all together we arrive at the following fact: it is possible
to (exactly) make any amount of postage greater than 27 cents using just
5-cent and 8-cent stamps.4 In other words, P(k) is true for any k ≥ 28. To
prove this, we could do the following:
1. Demonstrate that P(28) is true.
4This is not claiming that there are no amounts less than 27 cents which can also be
made.

2.5. Induction

179

2. Prove that if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is true (for any k ≥ 28).
Suppose we have done this. Then we know that the 28th term of the
sequence above is a T (using step 1, the initial condition or base case), and
that every term after the 28th is T also (using step 2, the recursive part or
inductive case). Here is what the proof would actually look like.
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement “it is possible to make exactly n cents of
postage using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.” We will show P(n) is true for all
n ≥ 28.
First, we show that P(28) is true: 28  4 · 5 + 1 · 8, so we can make 28
cents using four 5-cent stamps and one 8-cent stamp.
Now suppose P(k) is true for some arbitrary k ≥ 28. Then it is possible
to make k cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. Note that since k ≥ 28, it
cannot be that we use fewer than three 5-cent stamps and fewer than three
8-cent stamps: using two of each would give only 26 cents. Now if we
have made k cents using at least three 5-cent stamps, replace three 5-cent
stamps by two 8-cent stamps. This replaces 15 cents of postage with 16
cents, moving from a total of k cents to k + 1 cents. Thus P(k + 1) is true.
On the other hand, if we have made k cents using at least three 8-cent
stamps, then we can replace three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps,
moving from 24 cents to 25 cents, giving a total of k + 1 cents of postage.
So in this case as well P(k + 1) is true.
Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for
all n ≥ 28.

Formalizing Proofs
What we did in the stamp example above works for many types of problems. Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about
all natural numbers, or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first
case (like 28 in the example above), and in some other situations too. In
particular, induction should be used when there is some way to go from
one case to the next – when you can see how to always “do one more.”
This is a big idea. Thinking about a problem inductively can give
new insight into the problem. For example, to really understand the
stamp problem, you should think about how any amount of postage
(greater than 28 cents) can be made (this is non-inductive reasoning) and
also how the ways in which postage can be made changes as the amount
increases (inductive reasoning). When you are asked to provide a proof
by induction, you are being asked to think about the problem dynamically;
how does increasing n change the problem?
But there is another side to proofs by induction as well. In mathematics, it is not enough to understand a problem, you must also be able
to communicate the problem to others. Like any discipline, mathematics

180

2. Sequences

has standard language and style, allowing mathematicians to share their
ideas efficiently. Proofs by induction have a certain formal style, and being able to write in this style is important. It allows us to keep our ideas
organized and might even help us with formulating a proof.
Here is the general structure of a proof by mathematical induction:
Induction Proof Structure.
Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: “Let
P(n) be the statement. . . ” To prove that P(n) is true for all n ≥ 0,
you must prove two facts:
1. Base case: Prove that P(0) is true. You do this directly. This is
often easy.
2. Inductive case: Prove that P(k) → P(k + 1) for all k ≥ 0. That
is, prove that for any k ≥ 0 if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is
true as well. This is the proof of an if . . . then . . . statement,
so you can assume P(k) is true (P(k) is called the inductive
hypothesis). You must then explain why P(k + 1) is also true,
given that assumption.
Assuming you are successful on both parts above, you can conclude, “Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, the
statement P(n) is true for all n ≥ 0.”
Sometimes the statement P(n) will only be true for values of n ≥ 4,
for example, or some other value. In such cases, replace all the 0’s above
with 4’s (or the other value).
The other advantage of formalizing inductive proofs is it allows us
to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid. Why does
induction work? Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their
edges. We want to argue that in a minute, all the dominoes will have
fallen down. For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino.
That is the base case. It will also have to be that the dominoes are close
enough together that when any particular domino falls, it will cause the
next domino to fall. That is the inductive case. If both of these conditions
are met, you push the first domino over and each domino will cause the
next to fall, then all the dominoes will fall.
Induction is powerful! Think how much easier it is to knock over
dominoes when you don’t have to push over each domino yourself. You
just start the chain reaction, and the rely on the relative nearness of the
dominoes to take care of the rest.
Think about our study of sequences. It is easier to find recursive
definitions for sequences than closed formulas. Going from one case to
the next is easier than going directly to a particular case. That is what is

2.5. Induction

181

so great about induction. Instead of going directly to the (arbitrary) case
for n, we just need to say how to get from one case to the next.
When you are asked to prove a statement by mathematical induction,
you should first think about why the statement is true, using inductive
reasoning. Explain why induction is the right thing to do, and roughly
why the inductive case will work. Then, sit down and write out a careful,
formal proof using the structure above.

Examples
Here are some examples of proof by mathematical induction.
Example 2.5.1

Prove for each natural number n ≥ 1 that 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n 

n(n+1)
2 .

Solution. First, let’s think inductively about this equation. In fact,
we know this is true for other reasons (reverse and add comes to
mind). But why might induction be applicable? The left-hand side
adds up the numbers from 1 to n. If we know how to do that,
adding just one more term (n + 1) would not be that hard. For
example, if n  100, suppose we know that the sum of the first 100
numbers is 5050 (so 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 100  5050, which is true). Now
to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just
add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We
would have 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 100 + 101  5050 + 101  5151. In fact,
it would always be easy to add just one more term. This is why we
should use induction.
Now the formal proof:
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  2 . We will
show that P(n) is true for all natural numbers n ≥ 1.
1(1+1)
Base case: P(1) is the statement 1  2 which is clearly true.
Inductive case: Let k ≥ 1 be a natural number. Assume (for
k(k+1)
induction) that P(k) is true. That means 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k  2 .
We will prove that P(k + 1) is true as well. That is, we must prove
(k+1)(k+2)
that 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k + (k + 1) 
. To prove this equation,
2
start by adding k + 1 to both sides of the inductive hypothesis:
n(n+1)

1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k + (k + 1) 

k(k + 1)
+ (k + 1).
2

Now, simplifying the right side we get:
k(k + 1)
k(k + 1) 2(k + 1)
+k+1

(k + 2)(k + 1)

.



Thus P(k + 1) is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction P(n) is true for all natural numbers n ≥ 1.
qed
Note that in the part of the proof in which we proved P(k+1) from P(k),
we used the equation P(k). This was the inductive hypothesis. Seeing
how to use the inductive hypotheses is usually straight forward when
proving a fact about a sum like this. In other proofs, it can be less obvious
where it fits in.
Example 2.5.2

Prove that for all n ∈ N, 6n − 1 is a multiple of 5.
Solution. Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem. What does increasing n do? Let’s try with a few examples.
If n  1, then yes, 61 − 1  5 is a multiple of 5. What does incrementing n to 2 look like? We get 62 − 1  35, which again is
a multiple of 5. Next, n  3: but instead of just finding 63 − 1,
what did the increase in n do? We will still subtract 1, but now
we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are
multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6
(because 62 − 1 is a multiple of 5, so 62 is one more than a multiple
of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5
look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when
you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in
any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if
you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.
The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still
get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple
of 5. Now the formal proof:
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement, “6n − 1 is a multiple of 5.” We will
prove that P(n) is true for all n ∈ N.
Base case: P(0) is true: 60 − 1  0 which is a multiple of 5.
Inductive case: Let k be an arbitrary natural number. Assume,
for induction, that P(k) is true. That is, 6k − 1 is a multiple of 5.
Then 6k − 1  5j for some integer j. This means that 6k  5j + 1.
Multiply both sides by 6:
6k+1  6(5 j + 1)  30j + 6.

2.5. Induction

183

But we want to know about 6k+1 − 1, so subtract 1 from both
sides:
6k+1 − 1  30j + 5.
Of course 30j + 5  5(6j + 1), so is a multiple of 5.
Therefore 6k+1 − 1 is a multiple of 5, or in other words, P(k + 1)
is true. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction P(n) is
true for all n ∈ N.
qed
We had to be a little bit clever (i.e., use some algebra) to locate the
− 1 inside of 6k+1 − 1 before we could apply the inductive hypothesis.
This is what can make inductive proofs challenging.
In the two examples above, we started with n  1 or n  0. We can
start later if we need to.
6k

Example 2.5.3

Prove that n 2 < 2n for all integers n ≥ 5.
Solution. First, the idea of the argument. What happens when
we increase n by 1? On the left-hand side, we increase the base
of the square and go to the next square number. On the righthand side, we increase the power of 2. This means we double the
number. So the question is, how does doubling a number relate
to increasing to the next square? Think about what the difference
of two consecutive squares looks like. We have (n + 1)2 − n 2 . This
factors:
(n + 1)2 − n 2  (n + 1 − n)(n + 1 + n)  2n + 1.
But doubling the right-hand side increases it by 2n , since 2n+1 
2n + 2n . When n is large enough, 2n > 2n + 1.
What we are saying here is that each time n increases, the lefthand side grows by less than the right-hand side. So if the left-hand
side starts smaller (as it does when n  5), it will never catch up.
Now the formal proof:
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement n 2 < 2n . We will prove P(n) is true
for all integers n ≥ 5.
Base case: P(5) is the statement 52 < 25 . Since 52  25 and
5
2  32, we see that P(5) is indeed true.
Inductive case: Let k ≥ 5 be an arbitrary integer. Assume, for
induction, that P(k) is true. That is, assume k 2 < 2k . We will prove
that P(k + 1) is true, i.e., (k + 1)2 < 2k+1 . To prove such an inequality,

184

2. Sequences

start with the left-hand side and work towards the right-hand side:
(k + 1)2  k 2 + 2k + 1
< 2k + 2k + 1
< 2k + 2k

. . . by the inductive hypothesis.
. . . since 2k + 1 < 2k for k ≥ 5.

 2k+1 .
Following the equalities and inequalities through, we get (k +
1)2 < 2k+1 , in other words, P(k + 1). Therefore by the principle of
mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 5.
qed
The previous example might remind you of the racetrack principle from
calculus, which says that if f (a) < g(a), and f 0(x) < g 0(x) for x > a, then
f (x) < g(x) for x > a. Same idea: the larger function is increasing at a
faster rate than the smaller function, so the larger function will stay larger.
In discrete math, we don’t have derivatives, so we look at differences. Thus
induction is the way to go.
Warning:.
With great power, comes great responsibility. Induction isn’t magic. It
seems very powerful to be able to assume P(k) is true. After all, we are
trying to prove P(n) is true and the only difference is in the variable: k vs.
n. Are we assuming that what we want to prove is true? Not really. We
assume P(k) is true only for the sake of proving that P(k + 1) is true.
Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction. Consider this incorrect “proof” that every Canadian has the same
eye color: Let P(n) be the statement that any n Canadians have the same
eye color. P(1) is true, since everyone has the same eye color as themselves. Now assume P(k) is true. That is, assume that in any group of k
Canadians, everyone has the same eye color. Now consider an arbitrary
group of k + 1 Canadians. The first k of these must all have the same
eye color, since P(k) is true. Also, the last k of these must have the same
eye color, since P(k) is true. So in fact, everyone the group must have the
same eye color. Thus P(k + 1) is true. So by the principle of mathematical
induction, P(n) is true for all n.
Clearly something went wrong. The problem is that the proof that
P(k) implies P(k + 1) assumes that k ≥ 2. We have only shown P(1) is
true. In fact, P(2) is false.

Strong Induction
Investigate!
Start with a square piece of paper. You want to cut this square
into smaller squares, leaving no waste (every piece of paper you
end up with must be a square). Obviously it is possible to cut
the square into 4 squares. You can also cut it into 9 squares. It
turns out you can cut the square into 7 squares (although not all
the same size). What other numbers of squares could you end up
with?

Attempt the above activity before proceeding

Sometimes, to prove that P(k + 1) is true, it would be helpful to know
that P(k) and P(k − 1) and P(k − 2) are all true. Consider the following
puzzle:
You have a rectangular chocolate bar, made up of n identical
squares of chocolate. You can take such a bar and break it
along any row or column. How many times will you have to
break the bar to reduce it to n single chocolate squares?
At first, this question might seem impossible. Perhaps I meant to ask for
the smallest number of breaks needed? Let’s investigate.
Start with some small cases. If n  2, you must have a 1 × 2 rectangle,
which can be reduced to single pieces in one break. With n  3, we must
have a 1 × 3 bar, which requires two breaks: the first break creates a single
square and a 1 × 2 bar, which we know takes one (more) break.
What about n  4? Now we could have a 2 × 2 bar, or a 1 × 4 bar. In
the first case, break the bar into two 2 × 2 bars, each which require one
more break (that’s a total of three breaks required). If we started with a
1 × 4 bar, we have choices for our first break. We could break the bar in
half, creating two 1 × 2 bars, or we could break off a single square, leaving
a 1 × 3 bar. But either way, we still need two more breaks, giving a total
of three.
It is starting to look like no matter how we break the bar (and no
matter how the n squares are arranged into a rectangle), we will always
have the same number of breaks required. It also looks like that number
is one less than n:
Conjecture 2.5.4 Given a n-square rectangular chocolate bar, it always takes
n − 1 breaks to reduce the bar to single squares.
It makes sense to prove this by induction because after breaking the bar
once, you are left with smaller chocolate bars. Reducing to smaller cases is
what induction is all about. We can inductively assume we already know

186

2. Sequences

how to deal with these smaller bars. The problem is, if we are trying to
prove the inductive case about a (k + 1)-square bar, we don’t know that
after the first break the remaining bar will have k squares. So we really
need to assume that our conjecture is true for all cases less than k + 1.
Is it valid to make this stronger assumption? Remember, in induction
we are attempting to prove that P(n) is true for all n. What if that were
not the case? Then there would be some first n 0 for which P(n0 ) was
false. Since n 0 is the first counterexample, we know that P(n) is true for
all n < n 0 . Now we proceed to prove that P(n 0 ) is actually true, based on
the assumption that P(n) is true for all smaller n.
This is quite an advantage: we now have a stronger inductive hypothesis. We can assume that P(1), P(2), P(3), . . . P(k) is true, just to show
that P(k + 1) is true. Previously, we just assumed P(k) for this purpose.
It is slightly easier if we change our variables for strong induction.
Here is what the formal proof would look like:
Strong Induction Proof Structure.
Again, start by saying what you want to prove: “Let P(n) be the
statement. . . ” Then establish two facts:
1. Base case: Prove that P(0) is true.
2. Inductive case: Assume P(k) is true for all k < n. Prove that
P(n) is true.
Conclude, “therefore, by strong induction, P(n) is true for all n > 0.”
Of course, it is acceptable to replace 0 with a larger base case if needed.5
Let’s prove our conjecture about the chocolate bar puzzle:
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement, “it takes n −1 breaks to reduce a n-square
chocolate bar to single squares.”
Base case: Consider P(2). The squares must be arranged into a 1 × 2
rectangle, and we require 2 − 1  1 breaks to reduce this to single squares.
Inductive case: Fix an arbitrary n ≥ 2 and assume P(k) is true for all
k < n. Consider a n-square rectangular chocolate bar. Break the bar once
along any row or column. This results in two chocolate bars, say of sizes a
and b. That is, we have an a-square rectangular chocolate bar, a b-square
rectangular chocolate bar, and a + b  n.
We also know that a < n and b < n, so by our inductive hypothesis,
P(a) and P(b) are true. To reduce the a-sqaure bar to single squares takes
a −1 breaks; to reduce the b-square bar to single squares takes b −1 breaks.
5Technically, strong induction does not require you to prove a separate base case. This
is because when proving the inductive case, you must show that P(0) is true, assuming
P(k) is true for all k < 0. But this is not any help so you end up proving P(0) anyway. To
be on the safe side, we will always include the base case separately.

2.5. Induction

187

Doing this results in our original bar being reduced to single squares. All
together it took the initial break, plus the a − 1 and b − 1 breaks, for a total
of 1 + a − 1 + b − 1  a + b − 1  n − 1 breaks. Thus P(n) is true.
Therefore, by strong induction, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 2.

Here is a more mathematically relevant example:
Example 2.5.5

Prove that any natural number greater than 1 is either prime or can
be written as the product of primes.
Solution. First, the idea: if we take some number n, maybe it is
prime. If so, we are done. If not, then it is composite, so it is the
product of two smaller numbers. Each of these factors is smaller
than n (but at least 2), so we can repeat the argument with these
numbers. We have reduced to a smaller case.
Now the formal proof:
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement, “n is either prime or can be written
as the product of primes.” We will prove P(n) is true for all n ≥ 2.
Base case: P(2) is true because 2 is indeed prime.
Inductive case: assume P(k) is true for all k < n. We want to
show that P(n) is true. That is, we want to show that n is either
prime or is the product of primes. If n is prime, we are done. If
not, then n has more than 2 divisors, so we can write n  m1 · m2 ,
with m 1 and m2 less than n (and greater than 1). By the inductive
hypothesis, m 1 and m2 are each either prime or can be written as
the product of primes. In either case, we have that n is written as
the product of primes.
Thus by the strong induction, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 2.
qed
Whether you use regular induction or strong induction depends on the
statement you want to prove. If you wanted to be safe, you could always
use strong induction. It really is stronger, so can accomplish everything
“weak” induction can. That said, using regular induction is often easier
since there is only one place you can use the induction hypothesis. There
is also something to be said for elegance in proofs. If you can prove a
statement using simpler tools, it is nice to do so.
As a final contrast between the two forms of induction, consider once
more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to
increase postage by one cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with
two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps). We
could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we
could show five base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32
cents (we would actually say how each of these is made). Now assume

188

2. Sequences

that it is possible to make k cents of postage for all k < n as long as k ≥ 28.
As long as n > 32, this means in particular we can make k  n − 5 cents.
Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make n cents.

for all values of n (besides of course that the thing it is claiming to

Proof. Let P(n) be the statement that n + 3  n + 7. We will prove
that P(n) is true for all n ∈ N. Assume, for induction that P(k) is true.
That is, k + 3  k + 7. We must show that P(k + 1) is true. Now since
k + 3  k + 7, add 1 to both sides. This gives k + 3 + 1  k + 7 + 1.
Regrouping (k + 1) + 3  (k + 1) + 7. But this is simply P(k + 1). Thus
by the principle of mathematical induction P(n) is true for all n ∈ N.

proof.
14. Find the flaw in the following “proof” of the “fact” that n < 100 for
every n ∈ N.
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement n < 100. We will prove P(n) is true
for all n ∈ N. First we establish the base case: when n  0, P(n) is
true, because 0 < 100. Now for the inductive step, assume P(k) is
true. That is, k < 100. Now if k < 100, then k is some number, like 80.
Of course 80+1  81 which is still less than 100. So k +1 < 100 as well.
But this is what P(k +1) claims, so we have shown that P(k) → P(k +1).

Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all
n ∈ N.

15. While the above proof does not work (it better not since the statement
it is trying to prove is false!) we can prove something similar. Prove
that there is a strictly increasing sequence a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . . of numbers
(not necessarily integers) such that a n < 100 for all n ∈ N. (By strictly
increasing we mean a n < a n+1 for all n. So each term must be larger
than the last.)
16. What is wrong with the following “proof” of the “fact” that for all
n ∈ N, the number n 2 + n is odd?
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement “n 2 + n is odd.” We will prove that
P(n) is true for all n ∈ N. Suppose for induction that P(k) is true,
that is, that k 2 + k is odd. Now consider the statement P(k + 1). Now
(k + 1)2 + (k + 1)  k 2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1  k 2 + k + 2k + 2. By the inductive
hypothesis, k 2 + k is odd, and of course 2k + 2 is even. An odd plus
an even is always odd, so therefore (k + 1)2 + (k + 1) is odd. Therefore
by the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all n ∈ N.

17. Now give a valid proof (by induction, even though you might be able
to do so without using induction) of the statement, “for all n ∈ N, the

make the induction argument work.

In this chapter we explored sequences and mathematical induction.
At first these might not seem entirely related, but there is a link: recursive
reasoning. When we have many cases (maybe infinitely many), it is often
easier to describe a particular case by saying how it relates to other cases,
instead of describing it absolutely. For sequences, we can describe the
nth term in the sequence by saying how it is related to the previous term.
When showing a statement involving the variable n is true for all values
of n, we can describe why the case for n  k is true on the basis of why
the case for n  k − 1 is true.
While thinking of problems recursively is often easer than thinking of
them absolutely (at least after you get used to thinking in this way), our
ultimate goal is to move beyond this recursive description. For sequences,
we want to find closed formulas for the nth term of the sequence. For proofs,
we want to know the statement is actually true for a particular n (not only
under the assumption that the statement is true for the previous value
of n). In this chapter we saw some methods for moving from recursive
descriptions to absolute descriptions.
• If the terms of a sequence increase by a constant difference or constant ratio (these are both recursive descriptions), then the sequences
are arithmetic or geometric, respectively, and we have closed formulas for each of these based on the initial terms and common
difference or ratio.
• If the terms of a sequence increase at a polynomial rate (that is, if the
differences between terms form a sequence with a polynomial closed

194

2. Sequences

formula), then the sequence is itself given by a polynomial closed
formula (of degree one more than the sequence of differences).
• If the terms of a sequence increase at an exponential rate, then we
expect the closed formula for the sequence to be exponential. These
sequences often have relatively nice recursive formulas, and the
characteristic root technique allows us to find the closed formula for
these sequences.
• If we want to prove that a statement is true for all values of n (greater
than some first small value), and we can describe why the statement
being true for n  k implies the statement is true for n  k + 1, then
the principle of mathematical induction gives us that the statement is
true for all values of n (greater than the base case).
Throughout the chapter we tried to understand why these facts listed
above are true. In part, that is what proofs, by induction or not, attempt
to accomplish: they explain why mathematical truths are in fact truths.
As we develop our ability to reason about mathematics, it is a good idea
to make sure that the methods of our reasoning are sound. The branch of
mathematics that deals with deciding whether reasoning is good or not
is mathematical logic, the subject of the next chapter.

Symbolic Logic and Proofs
Logic is the study of consequence. Given a few mathematical statements
or facts, we would like to be able to draw some conclusions. For example, if I told you that a particular real-valued function was continuous
on the interval [0, 1], and f (0)  −1 and f (1)  5, can we conclude that
there is some point between [0, 1] where the graph of the function crosses
the x-axis? Yes, we can, thanks to the Intermediate Value Theorem from
Calculus. Can we conclude that there is exactly one point? No. Whenever we find an “answer” in math, we really have a (perhaps hidden)
argument. Mathematics is really about proving general statements (like
the Intermediate Value Theorem), and this too is done via an argument,
usually called a proof. We start with some given conditions, the premises
of our argument, and from these we find a consequence of interest, our
conclusion.
The problem is, as you no doubt know from arguing with friends, not
all arguments are good arguments. A “bad” argument is one in which
the conclusion does not follow from the premises, i.e., the conclusion is
not a consequence of the premises. Logic is the study of what makes an
argument good or bad. In other words, logic aims to determine in which
cases a conclusion is, or is not, a consequence of a set of premises.
By the way, “argument” is actually a technical term in math (and
philosophy, another discipline which studies logic):
Arguments.
An argument is a set of statements, one of which is called the
conclusion and the rest of which are called premises. An argument
is said to be valid if the conclusion must be true whenever the
premises are all true. An argument is invalid if it is not valid; it
is possible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion to be
false.
For example, consider the following two arguments:

∴

∴

If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie.
Edith eats her vegetables.
Edith gets a cookie.
Florence must eat her vegetables in order to get a cookie.
Florence eats her vegetables.
Florence gets a cookie.
197

198

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

(The symbol “ ∴ ” means “therefore”)
Are these arguments valid? Hopefully you agree that the first one is
but the second one is not. Logic tells us why by analyzing the structure
of the statements in the argument. Notice the two arguments above look
almost identical. Edith and Florence both eat their vegetables. In both
cases there is a connection between the eating of vegetables and cookies.
But we claim that it is valid to conclude that Edith gets a cookie, but not
that Florence does. The difference must be in the connection between
eating vegetables and getting cookies. We need to be skilled at reading
and comprehending these sentences. Do the two sentences mean the
same thing? Unfortunately, in everyday language we are often sloppy,
and you might be tempted to say they are equivalent. But notice that just
because Florence must eat her vegetables, we have not said that doing so
would be enough (she might also need to clean her room, for example). In
everyday (non-mathematical) practice, you might be tempted to say this
“other direction” is implied. In mathematics, we never get that luxury.
Before proceeding, it might be a good idea to quickly review Section 0.2
where we first encountered statements and the various forms they can
take. The goal now is to see what mathematical tools we can develop to
better analyze these, and then to see how this helps read and write proofs.

A proposition is simply a statement. Propositional logic studies the
ways statements can interact with each other. It is important to remember
that propositional logic does not really care about the content of the
statements. For example, in terms of propositional logic, the claims, “if
the moon is made of cheese then basketballs are round,” and “if spiders
have eight legs then Sam walks with a limp” are exactly the same. They
are both implications: statements of the form, P → Q.

Truth Tables
Here’s a question about playing Monopoly:
If you get more doubles than any other player then you will
lose, or if you lose then you must have bought the most properties.
True or false? We will answer this question, and won’t need to know
anything about Monopoly. Instead we will look at the logical form of the
statement.
We need to decide when the statement (P → Q) ∨ (Q → R) is true.
Using the definitions of the connectives in Section 0.2, we see that for this
to be true, either P → Q must be true or Q → R must be true (or both).
Those are true if either P is false or Q is true (in the first case) and Q is false
or R is true (in the second case). So—yeah, it gets kind of messy. Luckily,
we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities. Enter truth
tables. The idea is this: on each row, we list a possible combination of T’s
and F’s (for true and false) for each of the sentential variables, and then
mark down whether the statement in question is true or false in that case.
We do this for every possible combination of T’s and F’s. Then we can
clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false. For complicated
statements, we will first fill in values for each part of the statement, as a
way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.
Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the
truth values of its parts and how they are connected, all you really need
to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives. Here they
are:

The truth table for negation looks like this:

¬P

None of these truth tables should come as a surprise; they are all just
restating the definitions of the connectives. Let’s try another one.

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

Example 3.1.1

Make a truth table for the statement ¬P ∨ Q.
Solution. Note that this statement is not ¬(P ∨ Q), the negation
belongs to P alone. Here is the truth table:
P

T
F

¬P

¬P ∨ Q

We added a column for ¬P to make filling out the last column
easier. The entries in the ¬P column were determined by the entries
in the P column. Then to fill in the final column, look only at the
column for Q and the column for ¬P and use the rule for ∨.
Now let’s answer our question about monopoly:
Example 3.1.2

Analyze the statement, “if you get more doubles than any other
player you will lose, or that if you lose you must have bought the
most properties,” using truth tables.
Solution. Represent the statement in symbols as (P → Q) ∨ (Q →
R), where P is the statement “you get more doubles than any other
player,” Q is the statement “you will lose,” and R is the statement
“you must have bought the most properties.” Now make a truth
table.
The truth table needs to contain 8 rows in order to account for
every possible combination of truth and falsity among the three
statements. Here is the full truth table:

The first three columns are simply a systematic listing of all
possible combinations of T and F for the three statements (do you
see how you would list the 16 possible combinations for four statements?). The next two columns are determined by the values of P,
Q, and R and the definition of implication. Then, the last column
is determined by the values in the previous two columns and the
definition of ∨. It is this final column we care about.
Notice that in each of the eight possible cases, the statement in
question is true. So our statement about monopoly is true (regardless of how many properties you own, how many doubles you roll,
or whether you win or lose).
The statement about monopoly is an example of a tautology, a statement which is true on the basis of its logical form alone. Tautologies are
always true but they don’t tell us much about the world. No knowledge
about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true.
In fact, it is equally true that “If the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is
still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.”

Logical Equivalence
You might have noticed in Example 3.1.1 that the final column in the
truth table for ¬P ∨ Q is identical to the final column in the truth table for
P → Q:
P
T
T
F
F

Q
T
F
T
F

P→Q
T
F
T
T

¬P ∨ Q
T
F
T

This says that no matter what P and Q are, the statements ¬P ∨ Q and
P → Q either both true or both false. We therefore say these statements
are logically equivalent.
Logical Equivalence.
Two (molecular) statements P and Q are logically equivalent provided P is true precisely when Q is true. That is, P and Q have
the same truth value under any assignment of truth values to their
atomic parts.
To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can
make a truth table for each and check whether the columns for the
two statements are identical.

202

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

Recognizing two statements as logically equivalent can be very helpful. Rephrasing a mathematical statement can often lend insight into
what it is saying, or how to prove or refute it. By using truth tables we can
systematically verify that two statements are indeed logically equivalent.
Example 3.1.3

Are the statements, “it will not rain or snow” and “it will not rain
and it will not snow” logically equivalent?
Solution. We want to know whether ¬(P∨Q) is logically equivalent
to ¬P ∧ ¬Q. Make a truth table which includes both statements:
P
T
T
F
F

Q
T
F
T
F

¬(P ∨ Q)
F
F
F
T

¬P ∧ ¬Q
F
F
F
T

Since in every row the truth values for the two statements are
equal, the two statements are logically equivalent.
Notice that this example gives us a way to “distribute” a negation
over a disjunction (an “or”). We have a similar rule for distributing over
conjunctions (“and”s):
De Morgan’s Laws.
¬(P ∧ Q) is logically equivalent to ¬P ∨ ¬Q.
¬(P ∨ Q) is logically equivalent to ¬P ∧ ¬Q.
This suggests there might be a sort of “algebra” you could apply to
statements (okay, there is: it is called Boolean algebra) to transform one
statement into another. We can start collecting useful examples of logical
equivalence, and apply them in succession to a statement, instead of
writing out a complicated truth table.
De Morgan’s laws do not do not directly help us with implications,
but as we saw above, every implication can be written as a disjunction:
Implications are Disjuctions.
P → Q is logically equivalent to ¬P ∨ Q.
Example: “If a number is a multiple of 4, then it is even” is
equivalent to, “a number is not a multiple of 4 or (else) it is even.”

3.1. Propositional Logic

203

With this and De Morgan’s laws, you can take any statement and
simplify it to the point where negations are only being applied to atomic
propositions. Well, actually not, because you could get multiple negations
stacked up. But this can be easily dealt with:
Double Negation.
¬¬P is logically equivalent to P.
Example: “It is not the case that c is not odd” means “c is odd.”

far.

Let’s see how we can apply the equivalences we have encountered so

Example 3.1.4

Prove that the statements ¬(P → Q) and P ∧ ¬Q are logically
equivalent without using truth tables.
Solution. We want to start with one of the statements, and transform it into the other through a sequence of logically equivalent
statements. Start with ¬(P → Q). We can rewrite the implication
as a disjunction this is logically equivalent to
¬(¬P ∨ Q).
Now apply DeMorgan’s law to get
¬¬P ∧ ¬Q.
Finally, use double negation to arrive at P ∧ ¬Q
Notice that the above example illustrates that the negation of an implication is NOT an implication: it is a conjunction! We saw this before,
in Section 0.2, but it is so important and useful, it warants a second blue
box here:
Negation of an Implication.
The negation of an implication is a conjuction:
¬(P → Q) is logically equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q.
That is, the only way for an implication to be false is for the hypothesis to be true AND the conclusion to be false.
To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can use
truth tables or a sequence of logically equivalent replacements. The truth

204

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

table method, although cumbersome, has the advantage that it can verify
that two statements are NOT logically equivalent.
Example 3.1.5

Are the statements (P ∨ Q) → R and (P → R) ∨ (Q → R) logically
equivalent?
Solution. Note that while we could start rewriting these statements
with logically equivalent replacements in the hopes of transforming
one into another, we will never be sure that our failure is due to
their lack of logical equivalence rather than our lack of imagination.
So instead, let’s make a truth table:
P
T
T
T
T
F
F
F

Q
T
T
F

T

T
F
T
F
T
F
T
T

(P → R) ∨ (Q → R)
T
F
T
T
T
T
T
T

Look at the fourth (or sixth) row. In this case, (P → R)∨(Q → R)
is true, but (P ∨ Q) → R is false. Therefore the statements are not
logically equivalent.
While we don’t have logical equivalence, it is the case that whenever (P ∨ Q) → R is true, so is (P → R) ∨ (Q → R). This tells us
that we can deduce (P → R) ∨ (Q → R) from (P ∨ Q) → R, just not
the reverse direction.

Deductions
Investigate!
Holmes owns two suits: one black and one tweed. He always
wears either a tweed suit or sandals. Whenever he wears his
tweed suit and a purple shirt, he chooses to not wear a tie. He
never wears the tweed suit unless he is also wearing either a
purple shirt or sandals. Whenever he wears sandals, he also
wears a purple shirt. Yesterday, Holmes wore a bow tie. What
else did he wear?

3.1. Propositional Logic

205

Earlier we claimed that the following was a valid argument:
If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie. Edith
ate her vegetables. Therefore Edith gets a cookie.
How do we know this is valid? Let’s look at the form of the statements.
Let P denote “Edith eats her vegetables” and Q denote “Edith can have a
cookie.” The logical form of the argument is then:
P→Q
P
Q

∴

This is an example of a deduction rule, an argument form which is
always valid. This one is a particularly famous rule called modus ponens.
Are you convinced that it is a valid deduction rule? If not, consider the
following truth table:
P
T
T
F
F

Q
T
F
T
F

P→Q
T
F
T
T

This is just the truth table for P → Q, but what matters here is that
all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth
table. Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must
be true given that the premises are true. The premises in this case are
P → Q and P. Which rows of the truth table correspond to both of these
being true? P is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row
has P → Q true as well. And lo-and-behold, in this one case, Q is also
true. So if P → Q and P are both true, we see that Q must be true as well.
Here are a few more examples.
Example 3.1.6

Show that

∴

P→Q
¬P → Q
Q

is a valid deduction rule.
Solution. We make a truth table which contains all the lines of the
argument form:

(we include a column for ¬P just as a step to help getting the
column for ¬P → Q).
Now look at all the rows for which both P → Q and ¬P → Q
are true. This happens only in rows 1 and 3. Hey! In those rows Q
is true as well, so the argument form is valid (it is a valid deduction
rule).
Example 3.1.7

Decide whether

Look at the second to last row. Here all three premises of the
argument are true, but the conclusion is false. Thus this is not a
valid deduction rule.
While we have the truth table in front of us, look at rows 1,
3, and 5. These are the only rows in which all of the statements
statements P → R, Q → R, and P ∨ Q are true. It also happens
that R is true in these rows as well. Thus we have discovered a new
deduction rule we know is valid:

3.1. Propositional Logic

Beyond Propositions
As we saw in Section 0.2, not every statement can be analyzed using
logical connectives alone. For example, we might want to work with the
statement:
All primes greater than 2 are odd.
To write this statement symbolically, we must use quantifiers. We can
translate as follows:
∀x((P(x) ∧ x > 2) → O(x)).
In this case, we are using P(x) to denote “x is prime” and O(x) to denote
“x is odd.” These are not propositions, since their truth value depends
on the input x. Better to think of P and O as denoting properties of their
input. The technical term for these is predicates and when we study them
in logic, we need to use predicate logic.
It is important to stress that predicate logic extends propositional logic
(much in the way quantum mechanics extends classical mechanics). You
will notice that our statement above still used the (propositional) logical connectives. Everything that we learned about logical equivalence
and deductions still applies. However, predicate logic allows us to analyze statements at a higher resolution, digging down into the individual
propositions P, Q, etc.
A full treatment of predicate logic is beyond the scope of this text.
One reason is that there is no systematic procedure for deciding whether
two statements in predicate logic are logically equivalent (i.e., there is no
analogue to truth tables here). Rather, we end with a two examples of
logical equivalence and deduction, to pique your interest.
Example 3.1.8

Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number. We can translate this into symbols as
¬∃x∀y(x ≤ y)

208

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

(literally, “it is not true that there is a number x such that for all
numbers y, x is less than or equal to y”).
However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers: we
can pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier
type (between universal and existential). So the statement above
should be logically equivalent to
∀x∃y(y < x).
Notice that y < x is the negation of x ≤ y. This literally says, “for
every number x there is a number y which is smaller than x.” We
see that this is another way to make our original claim.
Example 3.1.9

Can you switch the order of quantifiers? For example, consider the
two statements:
and

∀x∃yP(x, y)

∃y∀xP(x, y).

Are these logically equivalent?
Solution. These statements are NOT logically equivalent. To see
this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate P(x, y)
which makes one of the statements true and the other false.
Let P(x, y) be the predicate x < y. It is true, in the natural
numbers, that for all x there is some y greater than that x (since
there are infinitely many numbers). However, there is not a natural
number y which is greater than every number x. Thus it is possible
for ∀x∃yP(x, y) to be true while ∃y∀xP(x, y) is false.
We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some y for
which every x satisfies P(x, y), then certainly for every x there is
some y which satisfies P(x, y). The first is saying we can find one
y that works for every x. The second allows different y’s to work
for different x’s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the
same y that work for every x. In other words, while we don’t have
logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid
deduction rule:

∴

∃y∀xP(x, y)
∀x∃yP(x, y)

Put yet another way, this says that the single statement
∃y∀xP(x, y) → ∀x∃yP(x, y)

3.1. Propositional Logic

209

is always true. This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve
that term for necessary truths in propositional logic. A statement
in predicate logic that is necessarily true gets the more prestigious
designation of a law of logic (or sometimes logically valid, but
that is less fun).

Decide which of the following are valid proofs of the following
statement:
If ab is an even number, then a or b is even.
1. Suppose a and b are odd. That is, a  2k + 1 and b  2m + 1
for some integers k and m. Then
ab  (2k + 1)(2m + 1)
 4km + 2k + 2m + 1
 2(2km + k + m) + 1.
Therefore ab is odd.
2. Assume that a or b is even - say it is a (the case where b is
even is identical). That is, a  2k for some integer k. Then
ab  (2k)b
 2(kb).
Thus ab is even.
3. Suppose that ab is even but a and b are both odd. Namely,
ab  2n, a  2k + 1 and b  2j + 1 for some integers n, k,
and j. Then
2n  (2k + 1)(2j + 1)
2n  4k j + 2k + 2 j + 1
n  2k j + k + j + 0.5.
But since 2k j + k + j is an integer, this says that the integer
n is equal to a non-integer, which is impossible.
4. Let ab be an even number, say ab  2n, and a be an odd
number, say a  2k + 1.
ab  (2k + 1)b
2n  2kb + b
2n − 2kb  b
2(n − kb)  b.

Therefore b must be even.

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

Anyone who doesn’t believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly
has not tried to write proofs. Finding a way to convince the world that
a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and
can often be quite challenging. There is not a guaranteed path to success
in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German
mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes.
Centuries later, we still don’t have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that “Goldbach’s Conjecture” holds for all numbers less
than 4 × 1018 , which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).
Writing proofs is a bit of an art. Like any art, to be truly great at it, you
need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique.
Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the
proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct
arguments. A good place to start might be to study a classic.
Theorem 3.2.1 There are infinitely many primes.
Proof. Suppose this were not the case. That is, suppose there are only
finitely many primes. Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it p.
Consider the number
N  p! + 1  (p · (p − 1) · · · · 3 · 2 · 1) + 1.
Now N is certainly larger than p. Also, N is not divisible by any
number less than or equal to p, since every number less than or equal to
p divides p!. Thus the prime factorization of N contains prime numbers
(possibly just N itself) all greater than p. So p is not the largest prime, a
contradiction. Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
qed
This proof is an example of a proof by contradiction, one of the standard
styles of mathematical proof. First and foremost, the proof is an argument. It contains sequence of statements, the last being the conclusion
which follows from the previous statements. The argument is valid so
the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. Let’s go through the
proof line by line.
1. Suppose there are only finitely many primes. [this is a premise. Note
the use of “suppose.”]
2. There must be a largest prime, call it p. [follows from line 1, by the
definition of “finitely many.”]
3. Let N  p! + 1. [basically just notation, although this is the inspired part
of the proof; looking at p! + 1 is the key insight.]
4. N is larger than p. [by the definition of p!]

3.2. Proofs

215

5. N is not divisible by any number less than or equal to p. [by definition,
p! is divisible by each number less than or equal to p, so p! + 1 is not.]
6. The prime factorization of N contains prime numbers greater than
p. [since N is divisible by each prime number in the prime factorization of
N, and by line 5.]
7. Therefore p is not the largest prime. [by line 6, N is divisible by a prime
larger than p.]
8. This is a contradiction. [from line 2 and line 7: the largest prime is p
and there is a prime larger than p.]
9. Therefore there are infinitely many primes. [from line 1 and line 8:
our only premise lead to a contradiction, so the premise is false.]
We should say a bit more about the last line. Up through line 8, we have
a valid argument with the premise “there are only finitely many primes”
and the conclusion “there is a prime larger than the largest prime.” This
is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines. So if the
premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. However, the conclusion is NOT true. The only way out: the premise must be false.
The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really
understand what is going on. Whenever you come across a proof in a
textbook, you really should make sure you understand what each line is
saying and why it is true. Additionally, it is equally important to understand the overall structure of the proof. This is where using tools from
logic is helpful. Luckily there are a relatively small number of standard
proof styles that keep showing up again and again. Being familiar with
these can help understand proof, as well as give ideas of how to write
your own.

Direct Proof
The simplest (from a logic perspective) style of proof is a direct proof.
Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation
of what everything means. Direct proofs are especially useful when
proving implications. The general format to prove P → Q is this:
Assume P. Explain, explain, . . . , explain. Therefore Q.
Often we want to prove universal statements, perhaps of the form ∀x(P(x) →
Q(x)). Again, we will want to assume P(x) is true and deduce Q(x). But
what about the x? We want this to work for all x. We accomplish this by
fixing x to be an arbitrary element (of the sort we are interested in).
Here are a few examples. First, we will set up the proof structure for
a direct proof, then fill in the details.

216

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

Example 3.2.2

Prove: For all integers n, if n is even, then n 2 is even.
Solution. The format of the proof will be this: Let n be an arbitrary
integer. Assume that n is even. Explain explain explain. Therefore
n 2 is even.
To fill in the details, we will basically just explain what it means
for n to be even, and then see what that means for n 2 . Here is a
complete proof.
Proof. Let n be an arbitrary integer. Suppose n is even. Then n  2k
for some integer k. Now n 2  (2k)2  4k 2  2(2k 2 ). Since 2k 2 is an
integer, n 2 is even.
qed

Example 3.2.3

Prove: For all integers a, b, and c, if a|b and b|c then a|c. (Here x| y,
read “x divides y” means that y is a multiple of x, i.e., that x will
divide into y without remainder).
Solution. Even before we know what the divides symbol means,
we can set up a direct proof for this statement. It will go something
like this: Let a, b, and c be arbitrary integers. Assume that a|b and
b|c. Dot dot dot. Therefore a|c.
How do we connect the dots? We say what our hypothesis (a|b
and b|c) really means and why this gives us what the conclusion
(a|c) really means. Another way to say that a|b is to say that b  ka
for some integer k (that is, that b is a multiple of a). What are we
going for? That c  la, for some integer l (because we want c to be
a multiple of a). Here is the complete proof.
Proof. Let a, b, and c be integers. Assume that a|b and b|c. In other
words, b is a multiple of a and c is a multiple of b. So there are
integers k and j such that b  ka and c  jb. Combining these
(through substitution) we get that c  jka. But jk is an integer, so
this says that c is a multiple of a. Therefore a|c.
qed

Proof by Contrapositive
Recall that an implication P → Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P. There are plenty of examples of statements which
are hard to prove directly, but whose contrapositive can easily be proved
directly. This is all that proof by contrapositive does. It gives a direct

3.2. Proofs

217

proof of the contrapositive of the implication. This is enough because the
contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.
The skeleton of the proof of P → Q by contrapositive will always look
roughly like this:
Assume ¬Q. Explain, explain, . . . explain. Therefore ¬P.
As before, if there are variables and quantifiers, we set them to be arbitrary
elements of our domain. Here are two examples:
Example 3.2.4

Is the statement “for all integers n, if n 2 is even, then n is even”
true?
Solution. This is the converse of the statement we proved above
using a direct proof. From trying a few examples, this statement
definitely appears to be true. So let’s prove it.
A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary n and assuming that n 2 is even. But it is not at all clear
how this would allow us to conclude anything about n. Just because n 2  2k does not in itself suggest how we could write n as a
multiple of 2.
Try something else: write the contrapositive of the statement.
We get, for all integers n, if n is odd then n 2 is odd. This looks
much more promising. Our proof will look something like this:
Let n be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that n is not even. This
means that . . . . In other words . . . . But this is the same as saying
. . . . Therefore n 2 is not even.
Now we fill in the details:
Proof. We will prove the contrapositive. Let n be an arbitrary
integer. Suppose that n is not even, and thus odd. Then n  2k + 1
for some integer k. Now n 2  (2k +1)2  4k 2 +4k +1  2(2k 2 +2k)+1.
Since 2k 2 + 2k is an integer, we see that n 2 is odd and therefore not
even.
qed
Example 3.2.5

Prove: for all integers a and b, if a + b is odd, then a is odd or b is
odd.
Solution. The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be
hard to separate a and b from knowing something about a + b. On
the other hand, if we know something about a and b separately,
then combining them might give us information about a + b. The

218

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

contrapositive of the statement we are trying to prove is: for all
integers a and b, if a and b are even, then a + b is even. Thus our
proof will have the following format:
Let a and b be integers. Assume that a and b are both even. la
la la. Therefore a + b is even.
Here is a complete proof:
Proof. Let a and b be integers. Assume that a and b are even. Then
a  2k and b  2l for some integers k and l. Now a + b  2k + 2l 
2(k +1). Since k + l is an integer, we see that a + b is even, completing
the proof.
qed
Note that our assumption that a and b are even is really the
negation of a or b is odd. We used De Morgan’s law here.
We have seen how to prove some statements in the form of implications: either directly or by contrapositive. Some statements are not
written as implications to begin with.
Example 3.2.6

Consider the following statement: for every prime number p, either
p  2 or p is odd. We can rephrase this: for every prime number p,
if p , 2, then p is odd. Now try to prove it.
Solution.
Proof. Let p be an arbitrary prime number. Assume p is not odd.
So p is divisible by 2. Since p is prime, it must have exactly two
divisors, and it has 2 as a divisor, so p must be divisible by only 1 and
2. Therefore p  2. This completes the proof (by contrapositive).
qed

Proof by Contradiction
There might be statements
which really cannot be rephrased as implica√
tions. For example, “ 2 is irrational.” In this case, it is hard to know
where to start. What can we assume? Well, say we want to prove the
statement P. What if we could prove that ¬P → Q where Q was false? If
this implication is true, and Q is false, what can we say about ¬P? It must
be false as well, which makes P true!
This is why proof by contradiction works. If we can prove that ¬P
leads to a contradiction, then the only conclusion is that ¬P is false, so P
is true. That’s what we wanted to prove. In other words, if it is impossible
for P to be false, P must be true.
Here are three examples of proofs by contradiction:

3.2. Proofs

219

Example 3.2.7

√
Prove that 2 is irrational.
Solution.
√
Proof. Suppose not. Then 2 is equal to a fraction ba . Without loss
of generality, assume ba is in lowest terms (otherwise reduce the
fraction). So,
a2
2 2
b
2b 2  a 2 .
Thus a 2 is even, and as such a is even. So a  2k for some integer
k, and a 2  4k 2 . We then have,
2b 2  4k 2
b 2  2k 2 .
Thus b 2 is even, and as such b is even. Since a is also even,
√
we see that ba is not in lowest terms, a contradiction. Thus 2 is
irrational.
qed
Example 3.2.8

Prove: There are no integers x and y such that x 2  4y + 2.
Solution.
Proof. We proceed by contradiction. So suppose there are integers
x and y such that x 2  4y + 2  2(2y + 1). So x 2 is even. We have
seen that this implies that x is even. So x  2k for some integer
k. Then x 2  4k 2 . This in turn gives 2k 2  (2y + 1). But 2k 2 is
even, and 2y + 1 is odd, so these cannot be equal. Thus we have a
contradiction, so there must not be any integers x and y such that
x 2  4y + 2.
qed

Example 3.2.9

The Pigeonhole Principle: If more than n pigeons fly into n pigeon
holes, then at least one pigeon hole will contain at least two pigeons.
Prove this!

220

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

Solution.
Proof. Suppose, contrary to stipulation, that each of the pigeon
holes contain at most one pigeon. Then at most, there will be n
pigeons. But we assumed that there are more than n pigeons, so
this is impossible. Thus there must be a pigeonhole with more than
one pigeon.
qed
While we phrased this proof as a proof by contradiction, we
could have also used a proof by contrapositive since our contradiction was simply the negation of the hypothesis. Sometimes this
will happen, in which case you can use either style of proof. There
are examples however where the contradiction occurs “far away”
from the original statement.

Proof by (counter) Example
It is almost NEVER okay to prove a statement with just an example.
Certainly none of the statements proved above can be proved through an
example. This is because in each of those cases we are trying to prove that
something holds of all integers. We claim that n 2 being even implies that
n is even, no matter what integer n we pick. Showing that this works for
n  4 is not even close to enough.
This cannot be stressed enough. If you are trying to prove a statement
of the form ∀xP(x), you absolutely CANNOT prove this with an example.1
However, existential statements can be proven this way. If we want to
prove that there is an integer n such that n 2 − n + 41 is not prime, all we
need to do is find one. This might seem like a silly thing to want to prove
until you try a few values for n.

So far we have gotten only primes. You might be tempted to conjecture,
“For all positive integers n, the number n 2 − n + 41 is prime.” If you
wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by
contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough
to give even 7 examples. In fact, we can prove this conjecture is false by
proving its negation: “There is a positive integer n such that n 2 − n + 41 is
not prime.” Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that
there does indeed exist such a number.
In fact, we can quickly see that n  41 will give 412 which is certainly
not prime. You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture
1This is not to say that looking at examples is a waste of time. Doing so will often give
you an idea of how to write a proof. But the examples do not belong in the proof.

3.2. Proofs

221

that n 2 − n + 41 is always prime. Since so many statements in mathematics
are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that
a statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample.
Example 3.2.10

Above we proved, “for all integers a and b, if a + b is odd, then a is
odd or b is odd.” Is the converse true?
Solution. The converse is the statement, “for all integers a and b,
if a is odd or b is odd, then a + b is odd.” This is false! How do
we prove it is false? We need to prove the negation of the converse.
Let’s look at the symbols. The converse is
∀a∀b((O(a) ∨ O(b)) → O(a + b)).
We want to prove the negation:
¬∀a∀b((O(a) ∨ O(b)) → O(a + b)).
Simplify using the rules from the previous sections:
∃a∃b((O(a) ∨ O(b)) ∧ ¬O(a + b)).
As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from ∀
to ∃. We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which
is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.
Now we know what to do. To prove that the converse is false
we need to find two integers a and b so that a is odd or b is odd,
but a + b is not odd (so even). That’s easy: 1 and 3. (remember,
“or” means one or the other or both). Both of these are odd, but
1 + 3  4 is not odd.

Proof by Cases
We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we haven’t
even mentioned induction or combinatorial proofs here), but instead we
will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases. The idea is
to prove that P is true by proving that Q → P and ¬Q → P for some
statement Q. So no matter what, whether or not Q is true, we know that
P is true. In fact, we could generalize this. Suppose we want to prove P.
We know that at least one of the statements Q1 , Q2 , . . . , Q n is true. If we
can show that Q 1 → P and Q2 → P and so on all the way to Q n → P,

222

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

then we can conclude P. The key thing is that we want to be sure that one
of our cases (the Q i ’s) must be true no matter what.
If that last paragraph was confusing, perhaps an example will make
things better.
Example 3.2.11

Prove: For any integer n, the number (n 3 − n) is even.
Solution. It is hard to know where to start this, because we don’t
know much of anything about n. We might be able to prove that
n 3 −n is even if we knew that n was even. In fact, we could probably
prove that n 3 − n was even if n was odd. But since n must either
be even or odd, this will be enough. Here’s the proof.
Proof. We consider two cases: if n is even or if n is odd.
Case 1: n is even. Then n  2k for some integer k. This give
n 3 − n  8k 3 − 2k
 2(4k 2 − k),
and since 4k 2 − k is an integer, this says that n 3 − n is even.
Case 2: n is odd. Then n  2k + 1 for some integer k. This gives
n 3 − n  (2k + 1)3 − (2k + 1)
 8k 3 + 6k 2 + 6k + 1 − 2k − 1
 2(4k 3 + 3k 2 + 2k),
and since 4k 3 + 3k 2 + 2k is an integer, we see that n 3 − n is even
again.
Since n 3 − n is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that n 3 − n
is indeed always even.

Chapter Summary

We have considered logic both as its own sub-discipline of mathematics,
and as a means to help us better understand and write proofs. In either
view, we noticed that mathematical statements have a particular logical
form, and analyzing that form can help make sense of the statement.
At the most basic level, a statement might combine simpler statements
using logical connectives. We often make use of variables, and quantify over
those variables. How to resolve the truth or falsity of a statement based
on these connectives and quantifiers is what logic is all about. From this,
we can decide whether two statements are logically equivalent or if one
or more statements (logically) imply another.
When writing proofs (in any area of mathematics) our goal is to explain
why a mathematical statement is true. Thus it is vital that our argument
implies the truth of the statement. To be sure of this, we first must know
what it means for the statement to be true, as well as ensure that the
statements that make up the proof correctly imply the conclusion. A firm
understanding of logic is required to check whether a proof is correct.
There is, however, another reason that understanding logic can be
helpful. Understanding the logical structure of a statement often gives
clues as how to write a proof of the statement.
This is not to say that writing proofs is always straight forward. Consider again the Goldbach conjecture:
Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum
of two primes.
We are not going to try to prove the statement here, but we can at least say
what a proof might look like, based on the logical form of the statement.
Perhaps we should write the statement in an equivalent way which better
highlights the quantifiers and connectives:
For all integers n, if n is even and greater than 2, then there
exists integers p and q such that p and q are prime and n  p+q.
What would a direct proof look like? Since the statement starts with a
universal quantifier, we would start by, ``Let n be an arbitrary integer."
The rest of the statement is an implication. In a direct proof we assume
the “if” part, so the next line would be, “Assume n is greater than 2 and is
even.” I have no idea what comes next, but eventually, we would need to
find two prime numbers p and q (depending on n) and explain how we
know that n  p + q.
Or maybe we try a proof by contradiction. To do this, we first assume
the negation of the statement we want to prove. What is the negation?
From what we have studied we should be able to see that it is,

228

3. Symbolic Logic and Proofs

There is an integer n such that n is even and greater than 2, but
for all integers p and q, either p or q is not prime or n , p + q.
Could this statement be true? A proof by contradiction would start by
assuming it was and eventually conclude with a contradiction, proving
that our assumption of truth was incorrect. And if you can find such a
contradiction, you will have proved the most famous open problem in
mathematics. Good luck.

11. You come across four trolls playing bridge. They declare:
Troll 1: All trolls here see at least one knave.
Troll 2: I see at least one troll that sees only knaves.
Troll 3: Some trolls are scared of goats.
Troll 4: All trolls are scared of goats.
Are there any trolls that are not scared of goats? Recall, of course,
that all trolls are either knights (who always tell the truth) or knaves
(who always lie).

Graph Theory
Investigate!
In the time of Euler, in the town of Königsberg in Prussia, there
was a river containing two islands. The islands were connected
to the banks of the river by seven bridges (as seen below). The
bridges were very beautiful, and on their days off, townspeople
would spend time walking over the bridges. As time passed, a
question arose: was it possible to plan a walk so that you cross
each bridge once and only once? Euler was able to answer this
question. Are you?

Graph Theory is a relatively new area of mathematics, first studied by
the super famous mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1735. Since then it
has blossomed in to a powerful tool used in nearly every branch of science
and is currently an active area of mathematics research.
The problem above, known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, is the
problem that originally inspired graph theory. Consider a “different”
problem: Below is a drawing of four dots connected by some lines. Is
it possible to trace over each line once and only once (without lifting up
your pencil, starting and ending on a dot)?

There is an obvious connection between these two problems. Any
path in the dot and line drawing corresponds exactly to a path over the
bridges of Königsberg.

231

4. Graph Theory

Pictures like the dot and line drawing are called graphs. Graphs are
made up of a collection of dots called vertices and lines connecting those
dots called edges. When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say
they are adjacent. The nice thing about looking at graphs instead of
pictures of rivers, islands and bridges is that we now have a mathematical
object to study. We have distilled the “important” parts of the bridge
picture for the purposes of the problem. It does not matter how big
the islands are, what the bridges are made out of, if the river contains
alligators, etc. All that matters is which land masses are connected to
which other land masses, and how many times.
We will return to the question of finding paths through graphs later.
But first, here are a few other situations you can represent with graphs:
Example 4.0.1

Al, Bob, Cam, Dan, and Euler are all members of the social networking website Facebook. The site allows members to be “friends”
with each other. It turns out that Al and Cam are friends, as are Bob
and Dan. Euler is friends with everyone. Represent this situation
with a graph.
Solution. Each person will be represented by a vertex and each
friendship will be represented by an edge. That is, two vertices will
be adjacent (there will be an edge between them) if and only if the
people represented by those vertices are friends.

Example 4.0.2

Each of three houses must be connected to each of three utilities.
Is it possible to do this without any of the utility lines crossing?
Solution. We will answer this question later. For now, notice how
we would ask this question in the context of graph theory. We
are really asking whether it is possible to redraw the graph below
without any edges crossing (except at vertices). Think of the top
row as the houses, bottom row as the utilities.

Before we start studying graphs, we need to agree upon what a graph
is. While we almost always think of graphs as pictures (dots connected
by lines) this is fairly ambiguous. Do the lines need to be straight? Does
it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are? Can there be
two lines connecting the same pair of dots? Can one line connect three
dots?
The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete
and rigorous definitions. Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is
incredibly important. The definition is the agreed upon starting point
from which all truths in mathematics proceed. Is there a graph with no
edges? We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.
We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also
must agree with our intuition for the objects we are studying. It needs to
be useful: we could define a graph to be a six legged mammal, but that

234

4. Graph Theory

would not let us solve any problems about bridges. Instead, here is the
(now) standard definition of a graph.
Graph Definition.
A graph is an ordered pair G  (V, E) consisting of a nonempty set
V (called the vertices) and a set E (called the edges) of two-element
subsets of V.
Strange. Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines. From
the definition, a graph could be
({a, b, c, d}, {{a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d}}).
Here we have a graph with four vertices (the letters a, b, c, d) and five
edges (the pairs {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d})).
Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process. That
is why we often draw a representation of these sets. We put a dot down
for each vertex, and connect two dots with a line precisely when those
two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges. Thus
one way to draw the graph described above is this:

a

b

c

d

However we could also have drawn the graph differently. For example
either of these:
a

d

c

b

a

b

c

d

We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be “the
same.” Actually, given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets
equal? Are the edge sets equal? We know what it means for sets to be
equal, and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets.
Example 4.1.1

Are the graphs below equal?
G1  ({a, b, c}, {{a, b}, {b, c}});

G2  ({a, b, c}, {{a, c}, {c, b}}).

Solution. No. Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which
is a good start. Also, both graphs have two edges. In the first graph,
we have edges {a, b} and {b, c}, while in the second graph we have

4.1. Definitions

235

edges {a, c} and {c, b}. Now we do have {b, c}  {c, b}, so that is
not the problem. The issue is that {a, b} , {a, c}. Since the edge
sets of the two graphs are not equal (as sets), the graphs are not
equal (as graphs).
Even if two graphs are not equal, they might be basically the same. The
graphs in the previous example could be drawn like this:

G1

G2

a

a

c

b

c

b

Graphs that are basically the same (but perhaps not equal) are called
isomorphic. We will give a precise definition of this term after a quick
example:
Example 4.1.2

Consider the graphs:
whe re and;
whe re and.
Are these graphs the same?
Solution. The two graphs are NOT equal. It is enough to notice
that V1 , V2 since a ∈ V1 but a < V2 . However, both of these
graphs consist of three vertices with edges connecting every pair
of vertices. We can draw them as follows:
a

b

u

c

v

w

Clearly we want to say these graphs are basically the same, so
while they are not equal, they will be isomorphic. We can rename
the vertices of one graph and get the second graph as the result.
Intuitively, graphs are isomorphic if they are basically the same, or
better yet, if they are the same except for the names of the vertices. To
make the concept of renaming vertices precise, we give the following
definitions:

236

4. Graph Theory

Isomorphic Graphs.
An isomorphism between two graphs G1 and G2 is a bĳection
f : V1 → V2 between the vertices of the graphs such that {a, b} is
an edge in G1 if and only if { f (a), f (b)} is an edge in G2 .
Two graphs are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between
them. In this case we write G1  G2 .
An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices. It
must be a bĳection so every vertex gets a new name. These newly named
vertices must be connected by edges precisely when they were connected
by edges with their old names.
Example 4.1.3

Decide whether the graphs G1  {V1 , E1 } and G2  {V2 , E2 } are
equal or isomorphic.
V1  {a, b, c, d}, E1  {{a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {c, d}}
V2  {a, b, c, d}, E2  {{a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {c, d}}
Solution. The graphs are NOT equal, since {a, d} ∈ E1 but {a, d} <
E2 . However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and same number of edges, they might be isomorphic (this is
not enough in most cases, but it is a good start).
We can try to build an isomorphism. How about we say f (a) 
b, f (b)  c, f (c)  d and f (d)  a. This is definitely a bĳection, but
to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make
sure it respects the edge relation. In G1 , vertices a and b are connected
by an edge. In G2 , f (a)  b and f (b)  c are connected by an edge.
So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges. The edge
{a, c} in G1 corresponds to { f (a), f (c)}  {b, d}, but here we have
a problem. There is no edge between b and d in G2 . Thus f is NOT
an isomorphism.
Not all hope is lost, however. Just because f is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all. We can
try again. At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to
see how they should match up.
G1 :

a

d

G2 :
b

c

a

d

b

c

Alternatively, notice that in G1 , the vertex a is adjacent to every
other vertex. In G2 , there is also a vertex with this property: c. So

4.1. Definitions

237

build the bĳection g : V1 → V2 by defining g(a)  c to start with.
Next, where should we send b? In G1 , the vertex b is only adjacent
to vertex a. There is exactly one vertex like this in G2 , namely d.
So let g(b)  d. As for the last two, in this example, we have a free
choice: let g(c)  b and g(d)  a (switching these would be fine as
well).
We should check that this really is an isomorphism. It is definitely a bĳection. We must make sure that the edges are respected.
The four edges in G1 are
{a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {c, d}.
Under the proposed isomorphism these become
{ g(a), g(b)}, { g(a), g(c)}, { g(a), g(d)}, { g(c), g(d)}
{c, d}, {c, b}, {c, a}, {b, a},
which are precisely the edges in G2 . Thus g is an isomorphism, so
G1  G2
Sometimes we will talk about a graph with a special name (like K n or
the Peterson graph) or perhaps draw a graph without any labels. In this
case we are really referring to all graphs isomorphic to any copy of that
particular graph. A collection of isomorphic graphs is often called an
isomorphism class. 1
There are other relationships between graphs that we care about, other
than equality and being isomorphic. For example, compare the following
pair of graphs:

These are definitely not isomorphic, but notice that the graph on the
right looks like it might be part of the graph on the left, especially if we
draw it like this:

1This is not unlike geometry, where we might have more than one copy of a particular
triangle. There instead of isomorphic we say congruent.

238

4. Graph Theory

We would like to say that the smaller graph is a subgraph of the larger.
We should give a careful definition of this. In fact, there are two
reasonable notions for what a subgraph should mean.
Subgraphs.
We say that G0  (V 0 , E0) is a subgraph of G  (V, E), and write
G0 ⊆ G, provided V 0 ⊆ V and E0 ⊆ E.
We say that G0  (V 0 , E0) is an induced subgraph of G  (V, E)
provided V 0 ⊆ V and every edge in E whose vertices are still in V 0
is also an edge in E0.
Notice that every induced subgraph is also an ordinary subgraph,
but not conversely. Think of a subgraph as the result of deleting some
vertices and edges from the larger graph. For the subgraph to be an
induced subgraph, we can still delete vertices, but now we only delete
those edges that included the deleted vertices.
Example 4.1.4

Consider the graphs:
f

f
e

d
a

b

G1

d

d
c

a

f

b

G2

c

a

d
b

G3

c

a

b

c

G4

Here both G2 and G3 are subgraphs of G1 . But only G2 is an
induced subgraph. Every edge in G1 that connects vertices in G2 is
also an edge in G2 . In G3 , the edge {a, b} is in E1 but not E3 , even
though vertices a and b are in V3 .
The graph G4 is NOT a subgraph of G1 , even though it looks
like all we did is remove vertex e. The reason is that in E4 we have
the edge {c, f } but this is not an element of E1 , so we don’t have
the required E4 ⊆ E1 .
Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs
we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to itself. Graphs like
these are sometimes called simple, although we will just call them graphs.
This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of
2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn’t make sense to
say a set contains an element more than once. So no pair of vertices can
be connected by an edge more than once. Also, since each edge must be

4.1. Definitions

239

a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to
itself by an edge.
That said, there are times we want to consider double (or more) edges
and single edge loops. For example, the “graph” we drew for the Bridges
of Königsberg problem had double edges because there really are two
bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore. We will call
these objects multigraphs. This is a good name: a multiset is a set in
which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.
The graphs above are also connected: you can get from any vertex to
any other vertex by following some path of edges. A graph that is not
connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together.
For example, the following graph is NOT connected because there is no
path from a to b:

a

b

Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add
all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called complete. That is, a
graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since
a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which
other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of
vertices. We give these a special name: K n is the complete graph on n
vertices.
Each vertex in K n is adjacent to n −1 other vertices. We call the number
of edges emanating from a given vertex the degree of that vertex. So every
vertex in K n has degree n − 1. How many edges does K n have? One might
think the answer should be n(n − 1), since we count n − 1 edges n times
(once for each vertex). However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we
counted every edge exactly twice. Thus
 there are n(n − 1)/2 edges in K n .
Alternatively, we can say there are n2 edges, since to draw an edge we
must choose 2 of the n vertices.
In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we
can find the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices will
always be twice the number of edges, since each edge adds to the degree of
two vertices. Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices
in any graph must be even!
This is our first example of a general result about all graphs. It seems
innocent enough, but we will use it to prove all sorts of other statements.
So let’s give it a name and state it formally.

240

4. Graph Theory

Lemma 4.1.5 Handshake Lemma. In any graph, the sum of the degrees of
vertices in the graph is always twice the number of edges.
The handshake lemma2 is sometimes called the degree sum formula,
and can be written symbolically as

Õ

d(v)  2e.

v∈V

Here we are using the notation d(v) for the degree of the vertex v.
One use for the lemma is to actually find the number of edges in a
graph. To do this, you must be given the degree sequence for the graph
(or be able to find it from other information). This is a list of every degree
of every vertex in the graph, generally written in non-increasing order.
Example 4.1.6

How many vertices and edges must a graph have if its degree
sequence is
(4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1)?
Solution. The number of vertices is easy to find: it is the number
of degrees in the sequence: 7. To find the number of edges, we
compute the degree sum:
4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1  20,
so the number of edges is half this: 10.
The handshake lemma also tells use what is not possible.
Example 4.1.7

At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by
shaking hands. Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands
with exactly 7 people at the seminar?
Solution. It seems like this should be possible. Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with. But this cannot
happen. We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have
each vertex have degree 7. If such a graph existed, the sum of the
degrees of the vertices would be 9 · 7  63. This would be twice the
number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with 31.5 edges.
That is impossible. Thus at least one (in fact an odd number) of the
2A lemma is a mathematical statement that is primarily of importance in that it is used
to establish other results.

4.1. Definitions

241

mathematicians must have shaken hands with an even number of
people at the seminar.
We can generalize the previous example to get the following proposition.3
Proposition 4.1.8 In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be
even.
Proof. Suppose there were a graph with an odd number of vertices with
odd degree. Then the sum of the degrees in the graph would be odd,
which is impossible, by the handshake lemma.
qed
We will consider further applications of the handshake lemma in the
exercises.
One final definition: we say a graph is bipartite if the vertices can be
divided into two sets, A and B, with no two vertices in A adjacent and no
two vertices in B adjacent. The vertices in A can be adjacent to some or
all of the vertices in B. If each vertex in A is adjacent to all the vertices in
B, then the graph is a complete bipartite graph, and gets a special name:
K m,n , where |A|  m and |B|  n. The graph in the houses and utilities
puzzle is K 3,3 .
Named Graphs.
Some graphs are used more than others, and get special names.
Kn

The complete graph on n vertices.

K m,n

The complete bipartite graph with sets of m and n vertices.

The cycle on n vertices, just one big loop.

The path on n + 1 vertices (so n edges), just one long path.

4. Graph Theory

Graph Theory Definitions.
There are a lot of definitions to keep track of in graph theory. Here is a
glossary of the terms we have already used and will soon encounter.
Graph

A collection of vertices, some of which are connected by edges.
More precisely, a pair of sets V and E where V is a set of vertices
and E is a set of 2-element subsets of V.

Adjacent
Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge. Two
edges are adjacent if they share a vertex.
Bipartite graph
A graph for which it is possible to divide the vertices into two
disjoint sets such that there are no edges between any two vertices
in the same set.
Complete bipartite graph
A bipartite graph for which every vertex in the first set is adjacent
to every vertex in the second set.
Complete graph
A graph in which every pair of vertices is adjacent.
Connected
A graph is connected if there is a path from any vertex to any other
vertex.
Chromatic number
The minimum number of colors required in a proper vertex coloring of the graph.
Cycle

A path (see below) that starts and stops at the same vertex, but
contains no other repeated vertices.

Degree of a vertex
The number of edges incident to a vertex.
Euler path
A walk which uses each edge exactly once.
Euler circuit
An Euler path which starts and stops at the same vertex.
Multigraph
A multigraph is just like a graph but can contain multiple edges
between two vertices as well as single edge loops (that is an edge
from a vertex to itself).

4.1. Definitions

243

Path A path is a walk that doesn’t repeat any vertices (or edges) except
perhaps the first and last. If a path starts and ends at the same
vertex, it is called a cycle.
Planar

A graph which can be drawn (in the plane) without any edges
crossing.

Subgraph
We say that H is a subgraph of G if every vertex and edge of H is
also a vertex or edge of G. We say H is an induced subgraph of G
if every vertex of H is a vertex of G and each pair of vertices in H
are adjacent in H if and only if they are adjacent in G.
Tree

A connected graph with no cycles. (If we remove the requirement
that the graph is connected, the graph is called a forest.) The
vertices in a tree with degree 1 are called leaves.

Vertex coloring
An assignment of colors to each of the vertices of a graph. A vertex
coloring is proper if adjacent vertices are always colored differently.
Walk A sequence of vertices such that consecutive vertices (in the sequence) are adjacent (in the graph). A walk in which no edge is
repeated is called a trail, and a trail in which no vertex is repeated
(except possibly the first and last) is called a path.

13. A graph is a way of representing the relationships between elements
in a set: an edge between the vertices x and y tells us that x is related

One very useful and common approach to studying graph theory
is to restrict your focus to graphs of a particular kind. For example,
you could try to really understand just complete graphs or just bipartite
graphs, instead of trying to understand all graphs in general. That is
what we are going to do now, looking at trees. Hopefully by the end of
this section we will have a better understanding of this class of graph, and
also understand why it is important enough to warrant its own section.
Definition of a Tree.
A tree is a connected graph containing no cycles.4
A forest is a graph containing no cycles. Note that this means
that a connected forest is a tree.
Does the definition above agree with your intuition for what graphs
we should call trees? Try thinking of examples of trees and make sure
they satisfy the definition. One thing to keep in mind is that while the
trees we study in graph theory are related to trees you might see in other
subjects, the correspondence is not exact. For instance, in anthropology,
you might study family trees, like the one below,
4Sometimes this is stated as “a tree is an acyclic connected graph;” “acyclic” is just a
fancy word for “containing no cycles.”

So far so good, but while your grandparents are (probably) not bloodrelatives, if we go back far enough, it is likely that they did have some
common ancestor. If you trace the tree back from you to that common
ancestor, then down through your other grandparent, you would have a
cycle, and thus the graph would not be a tree.
You might also have seen something called a decision tree (such as the
algorithm for deciding whether a series converges or diverges). Sometimes these too contain cycles, as the decision for one node might lead
you back to a previous step.
Both the examples of trees above also have another feature worth
mentioning: there is a clear order to the vertices in the tree. In general,
there is no reason for a tree to have this added structure, although we can
impose such a structure by considering rooted trees, where we simply
designate one vertex as the root. We will consider such trees in more
detail later in this section.

Properties of Trees
We wish to really understand trees. This means we should discover
properties of trees; what makes them special and what is special about
them.
A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Is there anything else we
can say? It would be nice to have other equivalent conditions for a graph
to be a tree. That is, we would like to know whether there are any graph
theoretic properties that all trees have, and perhaps even that only trees
have.
To get a feel for the sorts of things we can say, we will consider three
propositions about trees. These will also illustrate important proof techniques that apply to graphs in general, and happen to be a little easier for
trees.
Our first proposition gives an alternate definition for a tree. That is, it
gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be a tree.
Proposition 4.2.1 A graph T is a tree if and only if between every pair of distinct
vertices of T there is a unique path.

4.2. Trees

249

Proof. This is an “if and only if” statement, so we must prove two implications. We start by proving that if T is a tree, then between every pair of
distinct vertices there is a unique path.
Assume T is a tree, and let u and v be distinct vertices (if T only has
one vertex, then the conclusion is satisfied automatically). We must show
two things to show that there is a unique path between u and v: that there
is a path, and that there is not more than one path. The first of these is
automatic, since T is a tree, it is connected, so there is a path between any
pair of vertices.
To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between
u and v, and get a contradiction. The two paths might start out the same,
but since they are different, there is some first vertex u 0 after which the
two paths diverge. However, since the two paths both end and v, there
is some first vertex after u 0 that they have in common, call it v 0. Now
consider the two paths from u 0 to v 0. Taken together, these form a cycle,
which contradicts our assumption that T is a tree.
Now we consider the converse: if between every pair of distinct vertices of T there is a unique path, then T is a tree. So assume the hypothesis:
between every pair of distinct vertices of T there is a unique path. To prove
that T is a tree, we must show it is connected and contains no cycles.
The first half of this is easy: T is connected, because there is a path
between every pair of vertices. To show that T has no cycles, we assume
it does, for the sake of contradiction. Let u and v be two distinct vertices
in a cycle of T. Since we can get from u to v by going clockwise or
counterclockwise around the cycle, there are two paths from u and v,
contradicting our assumption.
We have established both directions so we have completed the proof.
qed
Read the proof above very carefully. Notice that both directions had
two parts: the existence of paths, and the uniqueness of paths (which
related to the fact that there were no cycles). In this case, these two parts
were really separate. In fact, if we just considered graphs with no cycles
(a forest), then we could still do the parts of the proof that explore the
uniqueness of paths between vertices, even if there might not exist paths
between vertices.
This observation allows us to state the following corollary:5
Corollary 4.2.2 A graph F is a forest if and only if between any pair of vertices
in F there is at most one path.
We do not give a proof of the corollary (it is, after all, supposed to
follow directly from the proposition) but for practice, you are asked to
5A corollary is another sort of provable statement, like a proposition or theorem, but
one that follows direction from another already established statement, or its proof.

250

4. Graph Theory

give a careful proof in the exercises. When you do so, try to use proof by
contrapositive instead of proof by contradiction.
Our second proposition tells us that all trees have leaves: vertices of
degree one.
Proposition 4.2.3 Any tree with at least two vertices has at least two vertices of
degree one.
Proof. We give a proof by contradiction. Let T be a tree with at least
two vertices, and suppose, contrary to stipulation, that there are not two
vertices of degree one.
Let P be a path in T of longest possible length. Let u and v be the
endpoints of the path. Since T does not have two vertices of degree one,
at least one of these must have degree two or higher. Say that it is u. We
know that u is adjacent to a vertex in the path P, but now it must also be
adjacent to another vertex, call it u 0.
Where is u 0? It cannot be a vertex of P, because if it was, there would
be two distinct paths from u to u 0: the edge between them, and the first
part of P (up to u 0). But u 0 also cannot be outside of P, for if it was, there
would be a path from u 0 to v that was longer than P, which has longest
possible length.
This contradiction proves that there must be at least two vertices of
degree one. In fact, we can say a little more: u and v must both have
degree one.
qed
The proposition is quite useful when proving statements about trees,
because we often prove statements about trees by induction. To do so, we
need to reduce a given tree to a smaller tree (so we can apply the inductive
hypothesis). Getting rid of a vertex of degree one is an obvious choice,
and now we know there is always one to get rid of.
To illustrate how induction is used on trees, we will consider the
relationship between the number of vertices and number of edges in
trees. Is there a tree with exactly 7 vertices and 7 edges? Try to draw one.
Could a tree with 7 vertices have only 5 edges? There is a good reason
that these seem impossible to draw.
Proposition 4.2.4 Let T be a tree with v vertices and e edges. Then e  v − 1.
Proof. We will give a proof by induction on the number of vertices in the
tree. That is, we will prove that every tree with v vertices has exactly v − 1
edges, and then use induction to show this is true for all v ≥ 1.
For the base case, consider all trees with v  1 vertices. There is only
one such tree: the graph with a single isolated vertex. This graph has
e  0 edges, so we see that e  v − 1 as needed.
Now for the inductive case, fix k ≥ 1 and assume that all trees with
v  k vertices have exactly e  k − 1 edges. Now consider an arbitrary tree
T with v  k + 1 vertices. By Proposition 4.2.3, T has a vertex v 0 of degree

4.2. Trees

251

one. Let T 0 be the tree resulting from removing v 0 from T (together with
its incident edge). Since we removed a leaf, T 0 is still a tree (the unique
paths between pairs of vertices in T 0 are the same as the unique paths
between them in T).
Now T 0 has k vertices, so by the inductive hypothesis, has k − 1 edges.
What can we say about T? Well, it has one more edge than T 0, so it has
k edges. But this is exactly what we wanted: v  k + 1, e  k so indeed
e  v − 1. This completes the inductive case, and the proof.
qed
There is a very important feature of this induction proof that is worth
noting. Induction makes sense for proofs about graphs because we can
think of graphs as growing into larger graphs. However, this does NOT
work. It would not be correct to start with a tree with k vertices, and then
add a new vertex and edge to get a tree with k + 1 vertices, and note that
the number of edges also grew by one. Why is this bad? Because how do
you know that every tree with k + 1 vertices is the result of adding a vertex
to your arbitrary starting tree? You don’t!
The point is that whenever you give an induction proof that a statement about graphs that holds for all graphs with v vertices, you must
start with an arbitrary graph with v + 1 vertices, then reduce that graph to
a graph with v vertices, to which you can apply your inductive hypothesis.

Rooted Trees
So far, we have thought of trees only as a particular kind of graph. However, it is often useful to add additional structure to trees to help solve
problems. Data is often structured like a tree. This book, for example,
has a tree structure: draw a vertex for the book itself. Then draw vertices
for each chapter, connected to the book vertex. Under each chapter, draw
a vertex for each section, connecting it to the chapter it belongs to. The
graph will not have any cycles; it will be a tree. But a tree with clear
hierarchy which is not present if we don’t identify the book vertex as the
“top”.
As soon as one vertex of a tree is designated as the root, then every
other vertex on the tree can be characterized by its position relative to the
root. This works because there is a unique path between any two vertices
in a tree. So from any vertex, we can travel back to the root in exactly one
way. This also allows us to describe how distinct vertices in a rooted tree
are related.
If two vertices are adjacent, then we say one of them is the parent of
the other, which is called the child of the parent. Of the two, the parent is
the vertex that is closer to the root. Thus the root of a tree is a parent, but
is not the child of any vertex (and is unique in this respect: all non-root
vertices have exactly one parent).

252

4. Graph Theory

Not surprisingly, the child of a child of a vertex is called the grandchild
of the vertex (and it is the grandparent). More in general, we say that a
vertex v is a descendent of a vertex u provided u is a vertex on the path
from v to the root. Then we would call u an ancestor of v.
For most trees (in fact, all except paths with one end the root), there
will be pairs of vertices neither of which is a descendant of the other. We
might call these cousins or siblings. In fact, vertices u and v are called
siblings provided they have the same parent. Note that siblings are never
adjacent (do you see why?).
Example 4.2.5

Consider the tree below.
b
a

c
d

f
e

h
i

g

If we designate vertex f as the root, then e, h, and i are the
children of f , and are siblings of each other. Among the other
things we cay say are that a is a child of c, and a descendant of
f . The vertex g is a descendant of f , in fact, is a grandchild of f .
Vertices g and d are siblings, since they have the common parent e.
Notice how this changes if we pick a different vertex for the
root. If a is the root, then its lone child is c, which also has only
one child, namely e. We would then have f the child of e (instead
of the other way around), and f is the descendant of a, instead of
the ancestor. f and g are now siblings.
All of this flowery language helps us describe how to navigate through
a tree. Traversing a tree, visiting each vertex in some order, is a key step
in many algorithms. Even if the tree is not rooted, we can always form a
rooted tree by picking any vertex as the root. Here is an example of why
doing so can be helpful.
Example 4.2.6

Explain why every tree is a bipartite graph.
Solution. To show that a graph is bipartite, we must divide the
vertices into two sets A and B so that no two vertices in the same
set are adjacent. Here is an algorithm that does just this.
Designate any vertex as the root. Put this vertex in set A. Now
put all of the children of the root in set B. None of these children

4.2. Trees

253

are adjacent (they are siblings), so we are good so far. Now put
into A every child of every vertex in B (i.e., every grandchild of the
root). Keep going until all vertices have been assigned one of the
sets, alternating between A and B every “generation.” That is, a
vertex is in set B if and only if it is the child of a vertex in set A.
The key to how we partitioned the tree in the example was to know
which vertex to assign to a set next. We chose to visit all vertices in the
same generation before any vertices of the next generation. This is usually
called a breadth first search (we say “search” because you often traverse
a tree looking for vertices with certain properties).
In contrast, we could also have partitioned the tree in a different order.
Start with the root, put it in A. Then look for one child of the root to put in
B. Then find a child of that vertex, into A, and then find its child, into B,
and so on. When you get to a vertex with no children, retreat to its parent
and see if the parent has any other children. So we travel as far from the
root as fast as possible, then backtrack until we can move forward again.
This is called depth first search.
These algorithmic explanations can serve as a proof that every tree
is bipartite, although care needs to be spent to prove that the algorithms
are correct. Another approach to prove that all trees are bipartite, using
induction, is requested in the exercises.

Spanning Trees
One of the advantages of trees is that they give us a few simple ways to
travel through the vertices. If a connected graph is not a tree, then we can
still use these traversal algorithms if we identify a subgraph that is a tree.
First we should consider if this even makes sense. Given any connected
graph G, will there always be a subgraph that is a tree? Well, that is
actually too easy: you could just take a single edge of G. If we want to
use this subgraph to tell us how to visit all vertices, then we want our
subgraph to include all of the vertices. We call such a tree a spanning
tree. It turns out that every connected graph has one (and usually many).
Spanning tree.
Given a connected graph G, a spanning tree of G is a subgraph of
G which is a tree and includes all the vertices of G.
Every connected graph has a spanning tree.
How do we know? We can give an algorithm for finding a spanning
tree! Start with a connected graph G. If there is no cycle, then G is already
a tree and we are done. If there is a cycle, let e be any edge in that cycle

254

4. Graph Theory

and consider the new graph G1  G − e (i.e., the graph you get by deleting
e). This tree is still connected since e belonged to a cycle, there were at
least two paths between its incident vertices. Now repeat: if G1 has no
cycles, we are done, otherwise define G2 to be G1 − e1 , where e1 is an edge
in a cycle in G1 . Keep going. This process must eventually stop, since
there are only a finite number of edges to remove. The result will be a
tree, and since we never removed any vertex, a spanning tree.
This is by no means the only algorithm for finding a spanning tree.
You could have started with the empty graph and added edges that belong
to G as long as adding them would not create a cycle. You have some
choices as to which edges you add first: you could always add an edge
adjacent to edges you have already added (after the first one, of course),
or add them using some other order. Which spanning tree you end up
with depends on these choices.
Example 4.2.7

Find two different spanning trees of the graph,

Solution. Here are two spanning trees.

Although we will not consider this in detail, these algorithms are
usually applied to weighted graphs. Here every edge has some weight
or cost assigned to it. The goal is to find a spanning tree that has the
smallest possible combined weight. Such a tree is called a minimum
spanning tree. Finding the minimum spanning tree uses basically the
same algorithms as we described above, but when picking an edge to
add, you always pick the smallest (or when removing an edge, you always
remove the largest).6

6If you add the smallest edge adjacent to edges you have already added, you are doing
Prim’s algorithm. If you add the smallest edge in the entire graph, you are following
Kruskal’s algorithm.

Planar Graphs

Investigate!
When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing, it is called planar. When a planar graph is drawn in this way,
it divides the plane into regions called faces.
1. Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same
number of vertices, edges, and faces.
2. Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same
number of vertices and edges, but a different number of
faces.

!

Attempt the above activity before proceeding

!

When is it possible to draw a graph so that none of the edges cross? If
this is possible, we say the graph is planar (since you can draw it on the
plane).
Notice that the definition of planar includes the phrase “it is possible
to.” This means that even if a graph does not look like it is planar, it still
might be. Perhaps you can redraw it in a way in which no edges cross.
For example, this is a planar graph:

That is because we can redraw it like this:

The graphs are the same, so if one is planar, the other must be too.
However, the original drawing of the graph was not a planar representation of the graph.
When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing, the edges
and vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions. We will call
each region a face. The graph above has 3 faces (yes, we do include the
“outside” region as a face). The number of faces does not change no
matter how you draw the graph (as long as you do so without the edges

4.3. Planar Graphs

259

crossing), so it makes sense to ascribe the number of faces as a property
of the planar graph.
WARNING: you can only count faces when the graph is drawn in a
planar way. For example, consider these two representations of the same
graph:

If you try to count faces using the graph on the left, you might say
there are 5 faces (including the outside). But drawing the graph with a
planar representation shows that in fact there are only 4 faces.
There is a connection between the number of vertices (v), the number
of edges (e) and the number of faces ( f ) in any connected planar graph.
This relationship is called Euler’s formula.
Euler’s Formula for Planar Graphs.
For any (connected) planar graph with v vertices, e edges and f
faces, we have
v − e + f  2.
Why is Euler’s formula true? One way to convince yourself of its
validity is to draw a planar graph step by step. Start with the graph P2 :

Any connected graph (besides just a single isolated vertex) must contain this subgraph. Now build up to your graph by adding edges and
vertices. Each step will consist of either adding a new vertex connected
by a new edge to part of your graph (so creating a new “spike”) or by
connecting two vertices already in the graph with a new edge (completing
a circuit).

What do these “moves” do? When adding the spike, the number of
edges increases by 1, the number of vertices increases by one, and the
number of faces remains the same. But this means that v − e + f does not

260

4. Graph Theory

change. Completing a circuit adds one edge, adds one face, and keeps
the number of vertices the same. So again, v − e + f does not change.
Since we can build any graph using a combination of these two moves,
and doing so never changes the quantity v − e + f , that quantity will be
the same for all graphs. But notice that our starting graph P2 has v  2,
e  1 and f  1, so v − e + f  2. This argument is essentially a proof by
induction. A good exercise would be to rewrite it as a formal induction
proof.

Non-planar Graphs
Investigate!
For the complete graphs K n , we would like to be able to say
something about the number of vertices, edges, and (if the graph
is planar) faces. Let’s first consider K 3 :
1. How many vertices does K3 have? How many edges?
2. If K 3 is planar, how many faces should it have?
Repeat parts (1) and (2) for K4 , K 5 , and K 23 .
What about complete bipartite graphs? How many vertices,
edges, and faces (if it were planar) does K 7,4 have? For which
values of m and n are K n and K m,n planar?

!

Attempt the above activity before proceeding

!

Not all graphs are planar. If there are too many edges and too few
vertices, then some of the edges will need to intersect. The smallest graph
where this happens is K 5 .

If you try to redraw this without edges crossing, you quickly get into
trouble. There seems to be one edge too many. In fact, we can prove that
no matter how you draw it, K 5 will always have edges crossing.
Theorem 4.3.1 K5 is not planar.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. So assume that K 5 is planar. Then the
graph must satisfy Euler’s formula for planar graphs. K 5 has 5 vertices
and 10 edges, so we get
5 − 10 + f  2,

4.3. Planar Graphs

261

which says that if the graph is drawn without any edges crossing, there
would be f  7 faces.
Now consider how many edges surround each face. Each face must
be surrounded by at least 3 edges. Let B be the total number of boundaries
around all the faces in the graph. Thus we have that 3 f ≤ B. But also
B  2e, since each edge is used as a boundary exactly twice. Putting this
together we get
3 f ≤ 2e.
But this is impossible, since we have already determined that f  7
and e  10, and 21 6≤ 20. This is a contradiction so in fact K 5 is not planar.
qed
The other simplest graph which is not planar is K 3,3

Proving that K3,3 is not planar answers the houses and utilities puzzle:
it is not possible to connect each of three houses to each of three utilities
without the lines crossing.
Theorem 4.3.2 K 3,3 is not planar.
Proof. Again, we proceed by contradiction. Suppose K 3,3 were planar.
Then by Euler’s formula there will be 5 faces, since v  6, e  9, and
6 − 9 + f  2.
How many boundaries surround these 5 faces? Let B be this number.
Since each edge is used as a boundary twice, we have B  2e. Also, B ≥ 4 f
since each face is surrounded by 4 or more boundaries. We know this is
true because K 3,3 is bipartite, so does not contain any 3-edge cycles. Thus
4 f ≤ 2e.
But this would say that 20 ≤ 18, which is clearly false. Thus K 3,3 is not
planar.
qed
Note the similarities and differences in these proofs. Both are proofs
by contradiction, and both start with using Euler’s formula to derive the
(supposed) number of faces in the graph. Then we find a relationship
between the number of faces and the number of edges based on how
many edges surround each face. This is the only difference. In the proof
for K 5 , we got 3 f ≤ 2e and for K3,3 we go 4 f ≤ 2e. The coefficient of f
is the key. It is the smallest number of edges which could surround any
face. If some number of edges surround a face, then these edges form a
cycle. So that number is the size of the smallest cycle in the graph.
In general, if we let g be the size of the smallest cycle in a graph (g
stands for girth, which is the technical term for this) then for any planar

graph we have g f ≤ 2e. When this disagrees with Euler’s formula, we
know for sure that the graph cannot be planar.

Polyhedra
Investigate!
A cube is an example of a convex polyhedron. It contains 6
identical squares for its faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. The cube
is a regular polyhedron (also known as a Platonic solid) because
each face is an identical regular polygon and each vertex joins an
equal number of faces.
There are exactly four other regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron with 4, 8, 12
and 20 faces respectively. How many vertices and edges do each
of these have?

Another area of mathematics where you might have heard the terms
“vertex,” “edge,” and “face” is geometry. A polyhedron is a geometric
solid made up of flat polygonal faces joined at edges and vertices. We
are especially interested in convex polyhedra, which means that any line
segment connecting two points on the interior of the polyhedron must be
entirely contained inside the polyhedron.7
Notice that since 8 − 12 + 6  2, the vertices, edges and faces of a
cube satisfy Euler’s formula for planar graphs. This is not a coincidence.
We can represent a cube as a planar graph by projecting the vertices and
edges onto the plane. One such projection looks like this:

In fact, every convex polyhedron can be projected onto the plane without edges crossing. Think of placing the polyhedron inside a sphere, with
a light at the center of the sphere. The edges and vertices of the polyhedron cast a shadow onto the interior of the sphere. You can then cut a hole
in the sphere in the middle of one of the projected faces and “stretch” the

must be less than 180 deg.

4.3. Planar Graphs

263

sphere to lie down flat on the plane. The face that was punctured becomes
the “outside” face of the planar graph.
The point is, we can apply what we know about graphs (in particular
planar graphs) to convex polyhedra. Since every convex polyhedron can
be represented as a planar graph, we see that Euler’s formula for planar
graphs holds for all convex polyhedra as well. We also can apply the same
sort of reasoning we use for graphs in other contexts to convex polyhedra.
For example, we know that there is no convex polyhedron with 11 vertices
all of degree 3, as this would make 33/2 edges.
Example 4.3.3

Is there a convex polyhedron consisting of three triangles and six
pentagons? What about three triangles, six pentagons and five
heptagons (7-sided polygons)?
Solution. How many edges would such polyhedra have? For the
first proposed polyhedron, the triangles would contribute a total
of 9 edges, and the pentagons would contribute 30. However, this
counts each edge twice (as each edge borders exactly two faces),
giving 39/2 edges, an impossibility. There is no such polyhedron.
The second polyhedron does not have this obstacle. The extra
35 edges contributed by the heptagons give a total of 74/2 = 37
edges. So far so good. Now how many vertices does this supposed
polyhedron have? We can use Euler’s formula. There are 14 faces,
so we have v − 37 + 14  2 or equivalently v  25. But now use the
vertices to count the edges again. Each vertex must have degree
at least three (that is, each vertex joins at least three faces since the
interior angle of all the polygons must be less that 180◦ ), so the sum
of the degrees of vertices is at least 75. Since the sum of the degrees
must be exactly twice the number of edges, this says that there are
strictly more than 37 edges. Again, there is no such polyhedron.
To conclude this application of planar graphs, consider the regular
polyhedra. We claimed there are only five. How do we know this is true?
We can prove it using graph theory.
Theorem 4.3.4 There are exactly five regular polyhedra.
Proof. Recall that all the faces of a regular polyhedron are identical regular
polygons, and that each vertex has the same degree. Consider four cases,
depending on the type of regular polygon.
Case 1: Each face is a triangle. Let f be the number of faces. There
are then 3 f /2 edges. Using Euler’s formula we have v − 3 f /2 + f  2 so
v  2 + f /2. Now each vertex has the same degree, say k. So the number

264

of edges is also kv/2. Putting this together gives
k(2 + f /2)
3f

,

e
which says

k

6f
.
4+ f
6f

Both k and f must be positive integers. Note that 4+ f is an increasing
function for positive f , bounded above by a horizontal asymptote at f  6.
Thus the only possible values for k are 3, 4, and 5. Each of these are
possible. To get k  3, we need f  4 (this is the tetrahedron). For k  4
we take f  8 (the octahedron). For k  5 take f  20 (the icosahedron).
Thus there are exactly three regular polyhedra with triangles for faces.
Case 2: Each face is a square. Now we have e  4 f /2  2 f . Using
Euler’s formula we get v  2 + f , and counting edges using the degree k
of each vertex gives us
k(2 + f )
.
e  2f 
2
Solving for k gives
k

4f
8f

.
2+ f
4+2f

This is again an increasing function, but this time the horizontal
asymptote is at k  4, so the only possible value that k could take is
3. This produces 6 faces, and we have a cube. There is only one regular
polyhedron with square faces.
Case 3: Each face is a pentagon. We perform the same calculation as
above, this time getting e  5 f /2 so v  2 + 3 f /2. Then
e

k(2 + 3 f /2)

so

4+3f

Now the horizontal asymptote is at 10
3 . This is less than 4, so we can
only hope of making k  3. We can do so by using 12 pentagons, getting
the dodecahedron. This is the only regular polyhedron with pentagons
as faces.
Case 4: Each face is an n-gon with n ≥ 6. Following the same procedure as above, we deduce that

which will be increasing to a horizontal asymptote of n−2

this asymptote is at k  3. Any larger value of n will give an even smaller
asymptote. Therefore no regular polyhedra exist with faces larger than
pentagons.a

This is an infinite planar graph; each

Coloring

Investigate!
Mapmakers in the fictional land of Euleria have drawn the borders
of the various dukedoms of the land. To make the map pretty,
they wish to color each region. Adjacent regions must be colored
differently, but it is perfectly fine to color two distant regions with
the same color. What is the fewest colors the mapmakers can use
and still accomplish this task?

!

Attempt the above activity before proceeding

!

Perhaps the most famous graph theory problem is how to color maps.
Given any map of countries, states, counties, etc., how many
colors are needed to color each region on the map so that
neighboring regions are colored differently?
Actual map makers usually use around seven colors. For one thing, they
require watery regions to be a specific color, and with a lot of colors it is
easier to find a permissible coloring. We want to know whether there is a
smaller palette that will work for any map.
How is this related to graph theory? Well, if we place a vertex in the
center of each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two
vertices if their states share a border, we get a graph. Coloring regions
on the map corresponds to coloring the vertices of the graph. Since
neighboring regions cannot be colored the same, our graph cannot have
vertices colored the same when those vertices are adjacent.

268

4. Graph Theory

In general, given any graph G, a coloring of the vertices is called (not
surprisingly) a vertex coloring. If the vertex coloring has the property
that adjacent vertices are colored differently, then the coloring is called
proper. Every graph has a proper vertex coloring. For example, you could
color every vertex with a different color. But often you can do better. The
smallest number of colors needed to get a proper vertex coloring is called
the chromatic number of the graph, written χ(G) .
Example 4.4.1

Find the chromatic number of the graphs below.

Solution. The graph on the left is K6 . The only way to properly
color the graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Thus the chromatic
number is 6.
The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors
(Red, Blue, and Green). For example:

B
G
R

R
B

G

There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there
are three vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle). Thus the
chromatic number is 3.
The graph on the right is just K 2,3 . As with all bipartite graphs,
this graph has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top
row red and the vertices on the bottom row blue.
It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can
get. It should not come as a surprise that K n has chromatic number n.
So how could there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring
question? If the chromatic number of graph can be arbitrarily large, then
it seems like there would be no upper bound to the number of colors
needed for any map. But there is.
The key observation is that while it is true that for any number n,
there is a graph with chromatic number n, only some graphs arrive as
representations of maps. If you convert a map to a graph, the edges

4.4. Coloring

269

between vertices correspond to borders between the countries. So you
should be able to connect vertices in such a way where the edges do not
cross. In other words, the graphs representing maps are all planar!
So the question is, what is the largest chromatic number of any planar
graph? The answer is the best known theorem of graph theory:
Theorem 4.4.2 The Four Color Theorem. If G is a planar graph, then the
chromatic number of G is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly
colored with 4 or fewer colors.
We will not prove this theorem. Really. Even though the theorem is
easy to state and understand, the proof is not. In fact, there is currently no
“easy” known proof of the theorem. The current best proof still requires
powerful computers to check an unavoidable set of 633 reducible configurations. The idea is that every graph must contain one of these reducible
configurations (this fact also needs to be checked by a computer) and that
reducible configurations can, in fact, be colored in 4 or fewer colors.

4. Graph Theory

Cartography is certainly not the only application of graph coloring.
There are plenty of situations in which you might wish partition the
objects in question so that related objects are not in the same set. For
example, you might wish to store chemicals safely. To avoid explosions,
certain pairs of chemicals should not be stored in the same room. By
coloring a graph (with vertices representing chemicals and edges representing potential negative interactions), you can determine the smallest
number of rooms needed to store the chemicals.
Here is a further example:
Example 4.4.3

Radio stations broadcast their signal at certain frequencies. However, there are a limited number of frequencies to choose from, so
nationwide many stations use the same frequency. This works because the stations are far enough apart that their signals will not
interfere; no one radio could pick them up at the same time.
Suppose 10 new radio stations are to be set up in a currently
unpopulated (by radio stations) region. The radio stations that are
close enough to each other to cause interference are recorded in the
table below. What is the fewest number of frequencies the stations
could use.

Solution. Represent the problem as a graph with vertices as the
stations and edges when two stations are close enough to cause
interference. We are looking for the chromatic number of the graph.
Vertices that are colored identically represent stations that can have
the same frequency.
This graph has chromatic number 5. A proper 5-coloring is
shown on the right. Notice that the graph contains a copy of the
complete graph K 5 so no fewer than 5 colors can be used.

In the example above, the chromatic number was 5, but this is not a
counterexample to the Four Color Theorem, since the graph representing
the radio stations is not planar. It would be nice to have some quick way to
find the chromatic number of a (possibly non-planar) graph. It turns out
nobody knows whether an efficient algorithm for computing chromatic
numbers exists.
While we might not be able to find the exact chromatic number of
graph easily, we can often give a reasonable range for the chromatic number. In other words, we can give upper and lower bounds for chromatic
number.
This is actually not very difficult: for every graph G, the chromatic
number of G is at least 1 and at most the number of vertices of G.
What? You want better bounds on the chromatic number? Well you
are in luck.
A clique in a graph is a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent.
In other words, a clique of size n is just a copy of the complete graph K n .
We define the clique number of a graph to be the largest n for which the
graph contains a clique of size n. Any clique of size n cannot be colored
with fewer than n colors, so we have a nice lower bound:
Theorem 4.4.4 The chromatic number of a graph G is at least the clique number
of G.
There are times when the chromatic number of G is equal to the clique
number. These graphs have a special name; they are called perfect. If you
know that a graph is perfect, then finding the chromatic number is simply
a matter of searching for the largest clique.8 However, not all graphs are
perfect.
For an upper bound, we can improve on “the number of vertices” by
looking to the degrees of vertices. Let ∆(G) be the largest degree of any
vertex in the graph G. One reasonable guess for an upper bound on the
chromatic number is χ(G) ≤ ∆(G) + 1. Why is this reasonable? Starting
8There are special classes of graphs which can be proved to be perfect. One such
class is the set of chordal graphs, which have the property that every cycle in the graph
contains a chord—an edge between two vertices in of the cycle which are not adjacent in
the cycle.

272

4. Graph Theory

with any vertex, it together with all of its neighbors can always be colored
in ∆(G)+1 colors, since at most we are talking about ∆(G)+1 vertices in this
set. Now fan out! At any point, if you consider an already colored vertex,
some of its neighbors might be colored, some might not. But no matter
what, that vertex and its neighbors could all be colored distinctly, since
there are at most ∆(G) neighbors, plus the one vertex being considered.
In fact, there are examples of graphs for which χ(G)  ∆(G) + 1. For
any n, the complete graph K n has chromatic number n, but ∆(K n )  n − 1
(since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Additionally, any odd
cycle will have chromatic number 3, but the degree of every vertex in a
cycle is 2. It turns out that these are the only two types of examples where
we get equality, a result known as Brooks’ Theorem.
Theorem 4.4.5 Brooks’ Theorem. Any graph G satisfies χ(G) ≤ ∆(G),
unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case χ(G)  ∆(G) + 1.
The proof of this theorem is just complicated enough that we will not
present it here (although you are asked to prove a special case in the
exercises). The adventurous reader is encouraged to find a book on graph
theory for suggestions on how to prove the theorem.

Coloring Edges
The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we
could also ask about coloring edges. Just like with vertex coloring, we
might insist that edges that are adjacent must be colored differently. Here,
we are thinking of two edges as being adjacent if they are incident to the
same vertex. The least number of colors required to properly color the
edges of a graph G is called the chromatic index of G, written χ0(G) .
Example 4.4.6

Six friends decide to spend the afternoon playing chess. Everyone
will play everyone else once. They have plenty of chess sets but
nobody wants to play more than one game at a time. Games will
last an hour (thanks to their handy chess clocks). How many hours
will the tournament last?
Solution. Represent each player with a vertex and put an edge
between two players if they will play each other. In this case, we
get the graph K 6 :

4.4. Coloring

273

We must color the edges; each color represents a different hour.
Since different edges incident to the same vertex will be colored
differently, no player will be playing two different games (edges) at
the same time. Thus we need to know the chromatic index of K 6 .
Notice that for sure χ0(K6 ) ≥ 5, since there is a vertex of degree 5.
It turns out 5 colors is enough (go find such a coloring). Therefore
the friends will play for 5 hours.
Interestingly, if one of the friends in the above example left, the remaining 5 chess-letes would still need 5 hours: the chromatic index of K5
is also 5.
In general, what can we say about chromatic index? Certainly χ0(G) ≥
∆(G). But how much higher could it be? Only a little higher.
Theorem 4.4.7 Vizing’s Theorem.
χ0(G) is either ∆(G) or ∆(G) + 1.

For any graph G, the chromatic index

At first this theorem makes it seem like chromatic index might not be
very interesting. However, deciding which case a graph is in is not always
easy. Graphs for which χ0(G)  ∆(G) are called class 1, while the others
are called class 2. Bipartite graphs always satisfy χ0(G)  ∆(G), so are
class 1 (this was proved by König in 1916, decades before Vizing proved
his theorem in 1964). In 1965 Vizing proved that all planar graphs with
∆(G) ≥ 8 are of class 1, but this does not hold for all planar graphs with
2 ≤ ∆(G) ≤ 5. Vizing conjectured that all planar graphs with ∆(G)  6
or ∆(G)  7 are class 1; the ∆(G)  7 case was proved in 2001 by Sanders
and Zhao; the ∆(G)  6 case is still open.
Ramsey Theory.
There is another interesting way we might consider coloring edges, quite
different from what we have discussed so far. What if we colored every
edge of a graph either red or blue. Can we do so without, say, creating a
monochromatic triangle (i.e., an all red or all blue triangle)? Certainly for
some graphs the answer is yes. Try doing so for K 4 . What about K5 ? K 6 ?
How far can we go?
The problem above is not too difficult and is a fun exercise. We could
extend the question in a variety of ways. What if we had three colors?
What if we were trying to avoid other graphs. Suprisingly, very little is
known about these questions. For example, we know that you need to go
up to K 17 in order to force a monochromatic triangle using three colors,
but nobody knows how big you need to go with more colors. Similarly,
we know that using two colors K 18 is the smallest graph that forces a
monochromatic copy of K4 , but the best we have to force a monochromatic

Euler Paths and Circuits

Investigate!
An Euler path, in a graph or multigraph, is a walk through the
graph which uses every edge exactly once. An Euler circuit is an
Euler path which starts and stops at the same vertex. Our goal is
to find a quick way to check whether a graph (or multigraph) has
an Euler path or circuit.

If we start at a vertex and trace along edges to get to other vertices, we
create a walk through the graph. More precisely, a walk in a graph is a
sequence of vertices such that every vertex in the sequence is adjacent to
the vertices before and after it in the sequence. If the walk travels along
every edge exactly once, then the walk is called an Euler path (or Euler
walk). If, in addition, the starting and ending vertices are the same (so
you trace along every edge exactly once and end up where you started),

278

4. Graph Theory

then the walk is called an Euler circuit (or Euler tour). Of course if a
graph is not connected, there is no hope of finding such a path or circuit.
For the rest of this section, assume all the graphs discussed are connected.
The bridges of Königsberg problem is really a question about the
existence of Euler paths. There will be a route that crosses every bridge
exactly once if and only if the graph below has an Euler path:

This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible
walk that does not reuse edges, and in doing so convince ourselves that
there is no Euler path (let alone an Euler circuit). On small graphs which
do have an Euler path, it is usually not difficult to find one. Our goal is
to find a quick way to check whether a graph has an Euler path or circuit,
even if the graph is quite large.
One way to guarantee that a graph does not have an Euler circuit is to
include a “spike,” a vertex of degree 1.
a

The vertex a has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit, you
see that you will get stuck at the vertex. It is a dead end. That is, unless
you start there. But then there is no way to return, so there is no hope
of finding an Euler circuit. There is however an Euler path. It starts at
the vertex a, then loops around the triangle. You will end at the vertex of
degree 3.
You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any
odd degree. If you start at such a vertex, you will not be able to end
there (after traversing every edge exactly once). After using one edge to
leave the starting vertex, you will be left with an even number of edges
emanating from the vertex. Half of these could be used for returning to
the vertex, the other half for leaving. So you return, then leave. Return,
then leave. The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one
by leaving the vertex. On the other hand, if you have a vertex with odd
degree that you do not start a path at, then you will eventually get stuck
at that vertex. The path will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to
arrive and leave again. Eventually all but one of these edges will be used
up, leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none to leave again.
What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler path and two vertices
with odd degree, then the Euler path must start at one of the odd degree
vertices and end at the other. In such a situation, every other vertex must

4.5. Euler Paths and Circuits

279

have an even degree since we need an equal number of edges to get to
those vertices as to leave them. How could we have an Euler circuit? The
graph could not have any odd degree vertex as an Euler path would have
to start there or end there, but not both. Thus for a graph to have an Euler
circuit, all vertices must have even degree.
The converse is also true: if all the vertices of a graph have even degree,
then the graph has an Euler circuit, and if there are exactly two vertices
with odd degree, the graph has an Euler path. To prove this is a little
tricky, but the basic idea is that you will never get stuck because there is
an “outbound” edge for every “inbound” edge at every vertex. If you try
to make an Euler path and miss some edges, you will always be able to
“splice in” a circuit using the edges you previously missed.
Euler Paths and Circuits.
• A graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the degree of every
vertex is even.
• A graph has an Euler path if and only if there are at most two
vertices with odd degree.
Since the bridges of Königsberg graph has all four vertices with odd
degree, there is no Euler path through the graph. Thus there is no way
for the townspeople to cross every bridge exactly once.

Hamilton Paths
Suppose you wanted to tour Königsberg in such a way that you visit each
land mass (the two islands and both banks) exactly once. This can be
done. In graph theory terms, we are asking whether there is a path which
visits every vertex exactly once. Such a path is called a Hamilton path (or
Hamiltonian path). We could also consider Hamilton cycles, which are
Hamliton paths which start and stop at the same vertex.
Example 4.5.1

Determine whether the graphs below have a Hamilton path.

Solution. The graph on the left has a Hamilton path (many different
ones, actually), as shown here:

280

4. Graph Theory

The graph on the right does not have a Hamilton path. You
would need to visit each of the “outside” vertices, but as soon as
you visit one, you get stuck. Note that this graph does not have
an Euler path, although there are graphs with Euler paths but no
Hamilton paths.
It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs
often have more edges than vertices, so there are fewer requirements to
be met. However, nobody knows whether this is true. There is no known
simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path. For small graphs
this is not a problem, but as the size of the graph grows, it gets harder and
harder to check wither there is a Hamilton path. In fact, this is an example
of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to
solve; it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete.

Matching in Bipartite Graphs

Investigate!
Given a bipartite graph, a matching is a subset of the edges for
which every vertex belongs to exactly one of the edges. Our goal
in this activity is to discover some criterion for when a bipartite
graph has a matching.
Does the graph below contain a matching? If so, find one.

Not all bipartite graphs have matchings. Draw as many fundamentally different examples of bipartite graphs which do NOT
have matchings. Your goal is to find all the possible obstructions
to a graph having a perfect matching. Write down the necessary
conditions for a graph to have a matching (that is, fill in the blank:
If a graph has a matching, then
). Then ask yourself whether
, then the
these conditions are sufficient (is it true that if

We conclude with one more example of a graph theory problem to
illustrate the variety and vastness of the subject.
Suppose you have a bipartite graph G. This will consist of two sets of
vertices A and B with some edges connecting some vertices of A to some
vertices in B (but of course, no edges between two vertices both in A or
both in B). A matching of A is a subset of the edges for which each vertex
of A belongs to exactly one edge of the subset, and no vertex in B belongs
to more than one edge in the subset. In practice we will assume that
|A|  |B| (the two sets have the same number of vertices) so this says that
every vertex in the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the matching.9
Some context might make this easier to understand. Think of the
vertices in A as representing students in a class, and the vertices in B as
representing presentation topics. We put an edge from a vertex a ∈ A to a
vertex b ∈ B if student a would like to present on topic b. Of course, some
students would want to present on more than one topic, so their vertex
would have degree greater than 1. As the teacher, you want to assign each
9Note: what we are calling a matching is sometimes called a perfect matching or complete
matching. This is because in it interesting to look at non-perfect matchings as well. We
will call those partial matchings.

284

4. Graph Theory

student their own unique topic. Thus you want to find a matching of A:
you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up
with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students.10
The question is: when does a bipartite graph contain a matching of A?
To begin to answer this question, consider what could prevent the graph
from containing a matching. This will not necessarily tell us a condition
when the graph does have a matching, but at least it is a start.
One way G could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in A not
adjacent to any vertex in B (so having degree 0). What else? What if
two students both like the same one topic, and no others? Then after
assigning that one topic to the first student, there is nothing left for the
second student to like, so it is very much as if the second student has
degree 0. Or what if three students like only two topics between them.
Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this down to the
previous case of two students liking only one topic. We can continue this
way with more and more students.
It should be clear at this point that if there is every a group of n
students who as a group like n − 1 or fewer topics, then no matching is
possible. This is true for any value of n, and any group of n students.
To make this more graph-theoretic, say you have a set S ⊆ A of vertices.
Define N(S) to be the set of all the neighbors of vertices in S. That is,
N(S) contains all the vertices (in B) which are adjacent to at least one of
the vertices in S. (In the student/topic graph, N(S) is the set of topics
liked by the students of S.) Our discussion above can be summarized as
follows:
Matching Condition.
If a bipartite graph G  {A, B} has a matching of A, then
|N(S)| ≥ |S|
for all S ⊆ A.
Is the converse true? Suppose G satisfies the matching condition
|N(S)| ≥ |S| for all S ⊆ A (every set of vertices has at least as many neighbors than vertices in the set). Does that mean that there is a matching?
10The standard example for matchings used to be the marriage problem in which A
consisted of the men in the town, B the women, and an edge represented a marriage
that was agreeable to both parties. A matching then represented a way for the town
elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed. We have chosen a more
progressive context for the sake of political correctness.

4.6. Matching in Bipartite Graphs

285

Surprisingly, yes. The obvious necessary condition is also sufficient.11
This is a theorem first proved by Philip Hall in 1935.12
Theorem 4.6.1 Hall’s Marriage Theorem. Let G be a bipartite graph with
sets A and B. Then G has a matching of A if and only if
|N(S)| ≥ |S|
for all S ⊆ A.
There are quite a few different proofs of this theorem – a quick internet
search will get you started.
In addition to its application to marriage and student presentation
topics, matchings have applications all over the place. We conclude with
one such example.
Example 4.6.2

Suppose you deal 52 regular playing cards into 13 piles of 4 cards
each. Prove that you can always select one card from each pile to
get one of each of the 13 card values Ace, 2, 3, . . . , 10, Jack, Queen,
and King.
Solution. Doing this directly would be difficult, but we can use the
matching condition to help. Construct a graph G with 13 vertices
in the set A, each representing one of the 13 card values, and 13
vertices in the set B, each representing one of the 13 piles. Draw an
edge between a vertex a ∈ A to a vertex b ∈ B if a card with value
a is in the pile b. Notice that we are just looking for a matching of
A; each value needs to be found in the piles exactly once.
We will have a matching if the matching condition holds. Given
any set of card values (a set S ⊆ A) we must show that |N(S)| ≥ |S|.
That is, the number of piles that contain those values is at least the
number of different values. But what if it wasn’t? Say |S|  k. If
|N(S)| < k, then we would have fewer than 4k different cards in
those piles (since each pile contains 4 cards). But there are 4k cards
with the k different values, so at least one of these cards must be in
another pile, a contradiction. Thus the matching condition holds,
so there is a matching, as required.
11This happens often in graph theory. If you can avoid the obvious counterexamples,
you often get what you want.
12There is also an infinite version of the theorem which was proved by Marshal Hall,
Jr. The name is a coincidence though as the two Halls are not related.

A bipartite graph that doesn’t have a matching might still have a
partial matching. By this we mean a set of edges for which no vertex
belongs to more than one edge (but possibly belongs to none). Every
bipartite graph (with at least one edge) has a partial matching, so we
can look for the largest partial matching in a graph.
Your “friend” claims that she has found the largest partial matching for the graph below (her matching is in bold). She explains that
no other edge can be added, because all the edges not used in her
partial matching are connected to matched vertices. Is she correct?

3.

One way you might check to see whether a partial matching is maximal is to construct an alternating path. This is a sequence of adjacent
edges, which alternate between edges in the matching and edges not
in the matching (no edge can be used more than once). If an alternating path starts and stops with an edge not in the matching, then it is
called an augmenting path.
(a) Find the largest possible alternating path for the partial matching of your friend’s graph. Is it an augmenting path? How
would this help you find a larger matching?

matching the largest one that exists in the graph?

We say that a set of vertices A ⊆ V is a vertex cover if every edge of the
graph is incident to a vertex in the cover (so a vertex cover covers the

that uses the fewest possible number of vertices.

to get a minimal vertex cover? Will your method always work?

Chapter Summary

Hopefully this chapter has given you some sense for the wide variety of
graph theory topics as well as why these studies are interesting. There
are many more interesting areas to consider and the list is increasing all
the time; graph theory is an active area of mathematical research.
One reason graph theory is such a rich area of study is that it deals
with such a fundamental concept: any pair of objects can either be related
or not related. What the objects are and what “related” means varies on
context, and this leads to many applications of graph theory to science
and other areas of math. The objects can be countries, and two countries
can be related if they share a border. The objects could be land masses
which are related if there is a bridge between them. The objects could be
websites which are related if there is a link from one to the other. Or we
can be completely abstract: the objects are vertices which are related if
their is an edge between them.
What question we ask about the graph depends on the application,
but often leads to deeper, general and abstract questions worth studying
in their own right. Here is a short summary of the types of questions we
have considered:
• Can the graph be drawn in the plane without edges crossing? If so,
how many regions does this drawing divide the plane into?
• Is it possible to color the vertices of the graph so that related vertices
have different colors using a small number of colors? How many
colors are needed?
• Is it possible to trace over every edge of a graph exactly once without
lifting up your pencil? What other sorts of “paths” might a graph
posses?
• Can you find subgraphs with certain properties? For example, when
does a (bipartite) graph contain a subgraph in which all vertices are
only related to one other vertex?
Not surprisingly, these questions are often related to each other. For
example, the chromatic number of a graph cannot be greater than 4 when
the graph is planar. Whether the graph has an Euler path depends on how
many vertices each vertex is adjacent to (and whether those numbers are

290

always even or not). Even the existence of matchings in bipartite graphs
can be proved using paths.

Generating Functions

There is an extremely powerful tool in discrete mathematics used to manipulate sequences called the generating function. The idea is this: instead of an infinite sequence (for example: 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, . . .) we look at a
single function which encodes the sequence. But not a function which
gives the nth term as output. Instead, a function whose power series (like
from calculus) “displays” the terms of the sequence. So for example, we
would look at the power series 2+3x +5x 2 +8x 3 +12x 4 +· · · which displays
the sequence 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, . . . as coefficients.
An infinite power series is simply an infinite sum of terms of the form
c n x n were c n is some constant. So we might write a power series like this:
∞
Õ

ck x k .

k0

or expanded like this
c0 + c1 x + c2 x 2 + c3 x 3 + c4 x 4 + c5 x 5 + · · · .
When viewed in the context of generating functions, we call such
a power series a generating series. The generating series generates the
sequence
c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 , c5 , . . . .
In other words, the sequence generated by a generating series is simply
the sequence of coefficients of the infinite polynomial.
Example 5.1.1

What sequence is represented by the generating series 3 + 8x 2 +
5
x 3 + x7 + 100x 6 + · · ·?

Solution. We just read off the coefficients of each x n term. So
a 0  3 since the coefficient of x 0 is 3 (x 0  1 so this is the constant
term). What is a 1 ? It is NOT 8, since 8 is the coefficient of x 2 , so 8
is the term a 2 of the sequence. To find a 1 we need to look for the
coefficient of x 1 which in this case is 0. So a 1  0. Continuing, we

295

296

have a 2  8, a 3  1, a 4  0, and a 5  71 . So we have the sequence
1
3, 0, 8, 1, , 100, . . . .
7
Note that when discussing generating functions, we always start
our sequence with a 0 .
Now you might very naturally ask why we would do such a thing.
One reason is that encoding a sequence with a power series helps us
keep track of which term is which in the sequence. For example, if we
write the sequence 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, . . . , 24, 41, . . . it is impossible to determine
which term 24 is (even if we agreed that the first term was supposed to be
a 0 ). However, if we wrote the generating series instead, we would have
1+3x +4x 2 +6x 3 +9x 4 +· · ·+24x 17 +41x 18 +· · ·. Now it is clear that 24 is the
17th term of the sequence (that is, a 17  24). Of course to get this benefit
we could have displayed our sequence in any number of ways, perhaps
1 0 3 1 4 2 6 3 9 4 · · · 24 17 41 18 · · ·, but we do not do this. The reason is
that the generating series looks like an ordinary power series (although
we are interpreting it differently) so we can do things with it that we
ordinarily do with power series such as write down what it converges to.
2
For example, from calculus we know that the power series 1 + x + x2 +
x4
xn
x3
x
x
6 + 24 + · · · + n! + · · · converges to the function e . So we can use e as
a way of talking about the sequence of coefficients of the power series for
e x . When we write down a nice compact function which has an infinite
power series that we view as a generating series, then we call that function
a generating function. In this example, we would say
1
1 1 1
1, 1, , , , . . . , , . . . has generating function e x .

Building Generating Functions
The e x example is very specific. We have a rather odd sequence, and
the only reason we know its generating function is because we happen
to know the Taylor series for e x . Our goal now is to gather some tools to
build the generating function of a particular given sequence.
Let’s see what the generating functions are for some very simple sequences. The simplest of all: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . . What does the generating
series look like? It is simply 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + · · ·. Now, can we find a
closed formula for this power series? Yes! This particular series is really
just a geometric series with common ratio x. So if we use our “multiply,

5.1. Generating Functions

S  1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · ·
−xS 

x + x2 + x3 + x4 + · · ·

(1 − x)S  1
Therefore we see that
1 + x + x2 + x3 · · · 

1
.
1−x

You might remember from calculus that this is only true on the interval
of convergence for the power series, in this case when |x| < 1. That is true
for us, but we don’t care. We are never going to plug anything in for x, so
as long as there is some value of x for which the generating function and
generating series agree, we are happy. And in this case we are happy.
1, 1, 1, . . ..
The generating function for 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . is

1
1−x

Let’s use this basic generating function to find generating functions
for more sequences. What if we replace x by −x. We get
1
 1 − x + x 2 − x 3 + · · · which generates 1, −1, 1, −1, . . . .
1+x
If we replace x by 3x we get
1
 1 + 3x + 9x 2 + 27x 3 + · · · which generates 1, 3, 9, 27, . . . .
1 − 3x
1
By replacing the x in 1−x
we can get generating functions for a variety
of sequences, but not all. For example, you cannot plug in anything for
x to get the generating function for 2, 2, 2, 2, . . .. However, we are not
lost yet. Notice that each term of 2, 2, 2, 2, . . . is the result of multiplying
the terms of 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . by the constant 2. So multiply the generating
function by 2 as well.

 2 + 2x + 2x 2 + 2x 3 + · · · which generates 2, 2, 2, 2, . . . .
1−x
Similarly, to find the generating function for the sequence 3, 9, 27, 81, . . .,
we note that this sequence is the result of multiplying each term of
1, 3, 9, 27, . . . by 3. Since we have the generating function for 1, 3, 9, 27, . . .
we can say
3
 3 · 1 + 3 · 3x + 3 · 9x 2 + 3 · 27x 3 + · · · which generates 3, 9, 27, 81, . . . .

5. Additional Topics

What about the sequence 2, 4, 10, 28, 82, . . .? Here the terms are always
1 more than powers of 3. That is, we have added the sequences 1, 1, 1, 1, . . .
and 1, 3, 9, 27, . . . term by term. Therefore we can get a generating function
by adding the respective generating functions:
2 + 4x + 10x 2 + 28x 3 + · · ·  (1 + 1) + (1 + 3)x + (1 + 9)x 2 + (1 + 27)x 3 + · · ·

function by x 2 we get

How could we get 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, . . .? Start with the previous sequence
and shift it over by 1. But how do you do this? To see how shifting works,
let’s first try to get the generating function for the sequence 0, 1, 3, 9, 27, . . ..
1
 1 + 3x + 9x 2 + 27x 3 + · · ·. To get the zero out front,
We know that 1−3x
we need the generating series to look like x + 3x 2 + 9x 3 + 27x 4 + · · · (so
there is no constant term). Multiplying by x has this effect. So the
x
generating function for 0, 1, 3, 9, 27, . . . is 1−3x
. This will also work to get
the generating function for 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, . . .:

is the generating series for 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .. This says

Differencing
1
using multipliWe have seen how to find generating functions from 1−x
cation (by a constant or by x), substitution, addition, and differentiation.
To use each of these, you must notice a way to transform the sequence
1, 1, 1, 1, 1 . . . into your desired sequence. This is not always easy. It is also
not really the way we have analyzed sequences. One thing we have considered often is the sequence of differences between terms of a sequence.
This will turn out to be helpful in finding generating functions as well.
The sequence of differences is often simpler than the original sequence.
So if we know a generating function for the differences, we would like to
use this to find a generating function for the original sequence.
For example, consider the sequence 2, 4, 10, 28, 82, . . .. How could we
move to the sequence of first differences: 2, 6, 18, 54, . . .? We want to
subtract 2 from the 4, 4 from the 10, 10 from the 28, and so on. So if we
subtract (term by term) the sequence 0, 2, 4, 10, 28, . . . from 2, 4, 10, 28 . . .,
we will be set. We can get the generating function for 0, 2, 4, 10, 28, . . .
from the generating function for 2, 4, 10, 28 . . . by multiplying by x. Use
A to represent the generating function for 2, 4, 10, 28, 82, . . . Then:

A  2 + 4x + 10x 2 + 28x 3 + 82x 4 + · · ·
−

xA  0 + 2x + 4x 2 + 10x 3 + 28x 4 + 82x 5 + · · ·

(1 − x)A  2 + 2x + 6x 2 + 18x 3 + 54x 4 + · · ·
While we don’t get exactly the sequence of differences, we do get
something close. In this particular case, we already know the generating
function A (we found it in the previous section) but most of the time we
will use this differencing technique to find A: if we have the generating
function for the sequence of differences, we can then solve for A.
Example 5.1.2

Find a generating function for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, . . ..
Solution. Notice that the sequence of differences is constant. We
know how to find the generating function for any constant sequence. So denote the generating function for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . by A.
We have

(1 − x)A  1 + 2x + 2x 2 + 2x 3 + 2x 4 + · · ·

Now solve for A:

1 − x (1 − x)2 (1 − x)2

Does this makes sense? Before we simplified the two fractions into one, we were adding the generating function for the
sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . to the generating function for the sequence
1
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . . (remember (1−x)
2 generates 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . ., multiplying by 2x shifts it over, putting the zero out front, and doubles
each term). If we add these term by term, we get the correct sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, . . ..
Now that we have a generating function for the odd numbers, we can
use that to find the generating function for the squares:
Example 5.1.3

Find the generating function for 1, 4, 9, 16, . . .. Note we take 1  a 0 .
Solution. Again we call the generating function for the sequence
A. Using differencing:
A  1 + 4x + 9x 2 + 16x 3 + · · ·
−

xA  0 + x + 4x 2 + 9x 3 + 16x 4 + · · ·

we have A 

In each of the examples above, we found the difference between consecutive terms which gave us a sequence of differences for which we
knew a generating function. We can generalize this to more complicated

5.1. Generating Functions

relationships between terms of the sequence. For example, if we know
that the sequence satisfies the recurrence relation a n  3a n−1 − 2a n−2 ? In
other words, if we take a term of the sequence and subtract 3 times the
previous term and then add 2 times the term before that, we get 0 (since
a n − 3a n−1 + 2a n−2  0). That will hold for all but the first two terms of
the sequence. So after the first two terms, the sequence of results of these
calculations would be a sequence of 0’s, for which we definitely know a
generating function.
Example 5.1.4

The sequence 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, . . . satisfies the recurrence relation
a n  3a n−1 − 2a n−2 . Find the generating function for the sequence.
Solution. Call the generating function for the sequence A. We have
A  1 + 3x + 7x 2 + 15x 3 + 31x 4 + · · · + a n x n + · · ·
−3xA  0 − 3x − 9x 2 − 21x 3 − 45x 4 − · · · − 3a n−1 x n − · · ·
+ 2x 2 A  0 + 0x + 2x 2 + 6x 3 + 14x 4 + · · · + 2a n−2 x n + · · ·
(1 − 3x + 2x 2 )A  1
We multiplied A by −3x which shifts every term over one spot
and multiplies them by −3. On the third line, we multiplied A by
2x 2 , which shifted every term over two spots and multiplied them
by 2. When we add up the corresponding terms, we are taking
each term, subtracting 3 times the previous term, and adding 2
times the term before that. This will happen for each term after
a 1 because a n − 3a n−1 + 2a n−2  0. In general, we might have two
terms from the beginning of the generating series, although in this
case the second term happens to be 0 as well.
Now we just need to solve for A:
A

1 − 3x + 2x 2

Multiplication and Partial Sums
What happens to the sequences when you multiply two generating functions? Let’s see: A  a 0 + a 1 x + a 2 x 2 + · · · and B  b 0 + b1 x + b2 x 2 + · · ·.
To multiply A and B, we need to do a lot of distributing (infinite FOIL?)
but keep in mind we will group like terms and only need to write down
the first few terms to see the pattern. The constant term is a 0 b0 . The
coefficient of x is a0 b1 + a 1 b 0 . And so on. We get:
AB  a 0 b0 +(a 0 b 1 +a 1 b0 )x+(a 0 b2 +a 1 b1 +a 2 b 0 )x 2 +(a 0 b3 +a 1 b2 +a 2 b 1 +a 3 b 0 )x 3 +· · · .

5. Additional Topics

Example 5.1.5

“Multiply” the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . by the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . ..
Solution. The new constant term is just 1 · 1. The next term will be
1 · 2 + 2 · 1  4. The next term: 1 · 4 + 2 · 2 + 3 · 1  11. One more:
1 · 8 + 2 · 4 + 3 · 2 + 4 · 1  28. The resulting sequence is
1, 4, 11, 28, 57, . . . .
Since the generating function for 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . is
generating function for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . is
generating function for 1, 4, 11, 28, 57, . . . is

1
1−2x ,

1
(1−x)2

and the

we have that the

1
(1−x)2 (1−2x)

Consider the special case when you multiply a sequence by 1, 1, 1, . . ..
For example, multiply 1, 1, 1, . . . by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . .. The first term is 1·1  1.
Then 1 · 2 + 1 · 1  3. Then 1 · 3 + 1 · 2 + 1 · 1  6. The next term will be 10. We
are getting the triangular numbers. More precisely, we get the sequence
of partial sums of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .. In terms of generating functions, we
1
1
(generating 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 . . .) and multiply it by (1−x)
take 1−x
2 (generating

1
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .) and this give (1−x)
3 . This should not be a surprise as we
found the same generating function for the triangular numbers earlier.
The point is, if you need to find a generating function for the sum of
the first n terms of a particular sequence, and you know the generating
1
. To go back from
function for that sequence, you can multiply it by 1−x
the sequence of partial sums to the original sequence, you look at the
sequence of differences. When you get the sequence of differences you
1
end up multiplying by 1 − x, or equivalently, dividing by 1−x
. Multiplying
1
1
by 1−x gives partial sums, dividing by 1−x gives differences.

Solving Recurrence Relations with Generating Functions
We conclude with an example of one of the many reasons studying generating functions is helpful. We can use generating functions to solve
recurrence relations.
Example 5.1.6

Solve the recurrence relation a n  3a n−1 − 2a n−2 with initial conditions a0  1 and a 1  3.
Solution. We saw in an example above that this recurrence relation
gives the sequence 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, . . . which has generating func1
tion
. We did this by calling the generating function A
1 − 3x + 2x 2

5.1. Generating Functions

303

and then computing A − 3xA + 2x 2 A which was just 1, since every
other term canceled out.
But how does knowing the generating function help us? First,
break up the generating function into two simpler ones. For this,
we can use partial fraction decomposition. Start by factoring the
denominator:
1
1

.
2
(1 − x)(1 − 2x)
1 − 3x + 2x
Partial fraction decomposition tells us that we can write this
faction as the sum of two fractions (we decompose the given fraction):
1
a
b

+
(1 − x)(1 − 2x) 1 − x 1 − 2x

for some constants a and b.

To find a and b we add the two decomposed fractions using a
common denominator. This gives
a(1 − 2x) + b(1 − x)
1

.
(1 − x)(1 − 2x)
(1 − x)(1 − 2x)
so

1  a(1 − 2x) + b(1 − x).

This must be true for all values of x. If x  1, then the equation
becomes 1  −a so a  −1. When x  12 we get 1  b/2 so b  2.
This tells us that we can decompose the fraction like this:
1
−1
2

+
.
(1 − x)(1 − 2x) 1 − x 1 − 2x
This completes the partial fraction decomposition. Notice that
these two fractions are generating functions we know. In fact, we
should be able to expand each of them.
−1
 −1−x−x 2 −x 3 −x 4 −· · · which generates −1, −1, −1, −1, −1, . . . .
1−x
2
 2+4x+8x 2 +16x 3 +32x 4 +· · · which generates 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . . .
1 − 2x
We can give a closed formula for the nth term of each of these
sequences. The first is just a n  −1. The second is a n  2n+1 .
The sequence we are interested in is just the sum of these, so the
solution to the recurrence relation is
a n  2n+1 − 1.

Introduction to Number Theory

We have used the natural numbers to solve problems. This was the right
set of numbers to work with in discrete mathematics because we always
dealt with a whole number of things. The natural numbers have been a
tool. Let’s take a moment now to inspect that tool. What mathematical
discoveries can we make about the natural numbers themselves?
This is the main question of number theory: a huge, ancient, complex,
and above all, beautiful branch of mathematics. Historically, number
theory was known as the Queen of Mathematics and was very much a
branch of pure mathematics, studied for its own sake instead of as a means
to understanding real world applications. This has changed in recent
years however, as applications of number theory have been unearthed.
Probably the most well known example of this is RSA cryptography, one
of the methods used in encrypt data on the internet. It is number theory
that makes this possible.
What sorts of questions belong to the realm of number theory? Here
is a motivating example. Recall in our study of induction, we asked:
Which amounts of postage can be made exactly using just
5-cent and 8-cent stamps?
We were able to prove that any amount greater than 27 cents could be
made. You might wonder what would happen if we changed the denomination of the stamps. What if we instead had 4- and 9-cent stamps?
Would there be some amount after which all amounts would be possible?
Well, again, we could replace two 4-cent stamps with a 9-cent stamp, or
three 9-cent stamps with seven 4-cent stamps. In each case we can create
one more cent of postage. Using this as the inductive case would allow us
to prove that any amount of postage greater than 23 cents can be made.
What if we had 2-cent and 4-cent stamps. Here it looks less promising.
If we take some number of 2-cent stamps and some number of 4-cent
stamps, what can we say about the total? Could it ever be odd? Doesn’t
look like it.
Why does 5 and 8 work, 4 and 9 work, but 2 and 4 not work? What is it
about these numbers? If I gave you a pair of numbers, could you tell me
right away if they would work or not? We will answer these questions,
and more, after first investigating some simpler properties of numbers
themselves.

Divisibility
It is easy to add and multiply natural numbers. If we extend our focus to
all integers, then subtraction is also easy (we need the negative numbers

308

5. Additional Topics

so we can subtract any number from any other number, even larger from
smaller). Division is the first operation that presents a challenge. If we
wanted to extend our set of numbers so any division would be possible
(maybe excluding division by 0) we would need to look at the rational
numbers (the set of all numbers which can be written as fractions). This
would be going too far, so we will refuse this option.
In fact, it is a good thing that not every number can be divided by other
numbers. This helps us understand the structure of the natural numbers
and opens the door to many interesting questions and applications.
If given numbers a and b, it is possible that a ÷ b gives a whole number.
In this case, we say that b divides a, in symbols, we write b | a. If this
holds, then b is a divisor or factor of a, and a is a multiple of b. In other
words, if b | a, then a  bk for some integer k (this is saying a is some
multiple of b).
The Divisibility Relation.
Given integers m and n, we say “m divides n” and write
m|n
provided n ÷ m is an integer. Thus the following assertions mean
the same thing:
1. m | n
2. n  mk for some integer k
3. m is a factor (or divisor) of n
4. n is a multiple of m.
Notice that m | n is a statement. It is either true or false. On the other
hand, n ÷ m or n/m is some number. If we want to claim that n/m is not
an integer, so m does not divide n, then we can write m - n.
Example 5.2.1

Decide whether each of the statements below are true or false.
1. 4 | 20
4. 5 | 0
7. −3 | 12
2. 20 | 4

5. 7 | 7

8. 8 | 12

3. 0 | 5

6. 1 | 37

9. 1642 | 136299

Solution.

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

309

1. True. 4 “goes into” 20 five times without remainder. In other
words, 20 ÷ 4  5, an integer. We could also justify this by
saying that 20 is a multiple of 4: 20  4 · 5.
2. False. While 20 is a multiple of 4, it is false that 4 is a multiple
of 20.
3. False. 5 ÷ 0 is not even defined, let alone an integer.
4. True. In fact, x | 0 is true for all x. This is because 0 is a
multiple of every number: 0  x · 0.
5. True. In fact, x | x is true for all x.
6. True. 1 divides every number (other than 0).
7. True. Negative numbers work just fine for the divisibility
relation. Here 12  −3 · 4. It is also true that 3 | −12 and that
−3 | −12.
8. False. Both 8 and 12 are divisible by 4, but this does not mean
that 12 is divisible by 8.
9. False. See below.
This last example raises a question: how might one decide whether
m | n? Of course, if you had a trusted calculator, you could ask it for the
value of n ÷ m. If it spits out anything other than an integer, you know
m - n. This seems a little like cheating though: we don’t have division, so
should we really use division to check divisibility?
While we don’t really know how to divide, we do know how to multiply. We might try multiplying m by larger and larger numbers until we
get close to n. How close? Well, we want to be sure that if we multiply m
by the next larger integer, we go over n.
For example, let’s try this to decide whether 1642 | 136299. Start
finding multiples of 1642:
1642 · 2  3284
bit:

1642 · 3  4926

1642 · 4  6568

···.

All of these are well less than 136299. I suppose we can jump ahead a
1642 · 50  82100

1642 · 80  131360

1642 · 85  139570.

Ah, so we need to look somewhere between 80 and 85. Try 83:
1642 · 83  136286.
Is this the best we can do? How far are we from our desired 136299?
If we subtract, we get 136299 − 136286  13. So we know we cannot go up

310

5. Additional Topics

to 84, that will be too much. In other words, we have found that
136299  83 · 1642 + 13.
Since 13 < 1642, we can now safely say that 1642 - 136299.
It turns out that the process we went through above can be repeated
for any pair of numbers. We can always write the number a as some
multiple of the number b plus some remainder. We know this because we
know about division with remainder from elementary school. This is just a
way of saying it using multiplication. Due to the procedural nature that
can be used to find the remainder, this fact is usually called the division
algorithm:
The Division Algorithm.
Given any two integers a and b, we can always find an integer q
such that
a  qb + r
where r is an integer satisfying 0 ≤ r < |b|
The idea is that we can always take a large enough multiple of b so
that the remainder r is as small as possible. We do allow the possibility
of r  0, in which case we have b | a.

Remainder Classes
The division algorithm tells us that there are only b possible remainders
when dividing by b. If we fix this divisor, we can group integers by the
remainder. Each group is called a remainder class modulo b (or sometimes
residue class).
Example 5.2.2

Describe the remainder classes modulo 5.
Solution. We want to classify numbers by what their remainder
would be when divided by 5. From the division algorithm, we
know there will be exactly 5 remainder classes, because there are
only 5 choices for what r could be (0 ≤ r < 5).
First consider r  0. Here we are looking for all the numbers
divisible by 5 since a  5q + 0. In other words, the multiples of 5.
We get the infinite set
{. . . , −15, −10, −5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, . . .}.

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

311

Notice we also include negative integers.
Next consider r  1. Which integers, when divided by 5, have
remainder 1? Well, certainly 1, does, as does 6, and 11. Negatives?
Here we must be careful: −6 does NOT have remainder 1. We can
write −6  −2 · 5 + 4 or −6  −1 · 5 − 1, but only one of these is a
“correct” instance of the division algorithm: r  4 since we need r
to be non-negative. So in fact, to get r  1, we would have −4, or
−9, etc. Thus we get the remainder class
{. . . , −14, −9, −4, 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, . . .}.
There are three more to go. The remainder classes for 2, 3, and
4 are, respectively
{. . . , −13, −8, −3, 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, . . .}
{. . . , −12, −7, −2, 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, . . .}
{. . . , −11, −6, −1, 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, . . .}.
Note that in the example above, every integer is in exactly one remainder class. The technical way to say this is that the remainder classes
modulo b form a partition of the integers.1 The most important fact about
partitions, is that it is possible to define an equivalence relation from a partition: this is a relationship between pairs of numbers which acts in all
the important ways like the “equals” relationship.2
All fun technical language aside, the idea is really simple. If two
numbers belong to the same remainder class, then in some way, they are
the same. That is, they are the same up to division by b. In the case where
b  5 above, the numbers 8 and 23, while not the same number, are the
same when it comes to dividing by 5, because both have remainder 3.
It matters what the divisor is: 8 and 23 are the same up to division by
5, but not up to division by 7, since 8 has remainder of 1 when divided by
7 while 23 has a remainder of 2.
With all this in mind, let’s introduce some notation. We want to say
that 8 and 23 are basically the same, even though they are not equal. It
would be wrong to say 8  23. Instead, we write 8 ≡ 23. But this is
not always true. It works if we are thinking division by 5, so we need to
denote that somehow. What we will actually write is this:
8 ≡ 23 (mod 5)
1It is possible to develop a mathematical theory of partitions, prove statements about
all partitions in general and then apply those observations to our case here.
2Again, there is a mathematical theory of equivalence relations which applies in many
more instances than the one we look at here.

312

5. Additional Topics

which is read, “8 is congruent to 23 modulo 5” (or just “mod 5”). Of
course then we could observe that
8 . 23 (mod 7).
Congruence Modulo n.
We say a is congruent to b modulo n, and write,
a≡b

(mod n)

provided a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. In
other words, provided a and b belong to the same remainder class
modulo n.
Many books define congruence modulo n slightly differently. They
say that a ≡ b (mod n) if and only if n | a − b. In other words, two
numbers are congruent modulo n, if their difference is a multiple of n.
So which definition is correct? Turns out, it doesn’t matter: they are
equivalent.
To see why, consider two numbers a and b which are congruent modulo n. Then a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. We
have
a  q1 n + r
b  q 2 n + r.
Here the two r’s really are the same. Consider what we get when we
take the difference of a and b:
a − b  q1 n + r − (q2 n + r)  q1 n − q 2 n  (q 1 − q2 )n.
So a − b is a multiple of n, or equivalently, n | a − b.
On the other hand, if we assume first that n | a − b, so a − b  kn, then
consider what happens if we divide each term by n. Dividing a by n will
leave some remainder, as will dividing b by n. However, dividing kn by
n will leave 0 remainder. So the remainders on the left-hand side must
cancel out. That is, the remainders must be the same.
Thus we have:
Congruence and Divisibility.
For any integers a, b, and n, we have
a≡b

(mod n)

if and only if

n | a − b.

It will also be useful to switch back and forth between congruences
and regular equations. The above fact helps with this. We know that
a ≡ b (mod n) if and only if n | a − b, if and only if a − b  kn for some

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

313

integer k. Rearranging that equation, we get a  b + kn. In other words,
if a and b are congruent modulo n, then a is b more than some multiple
of n. This conforms with our earlier observation that all the numbers in a
particular remainder class are the same amount larger than the multiples
of n.
Congruence and Equality.
For any integers a, b, and n, we have
a≡b

if and only if

(mod n)

a  b+kn for some integer k.

Properties of Congruence
We said earlier that congruence modulo n behaves, in many important
ways, the same way equality does. Specifically, we could prove that congruence modulo n is an equivalence relation, which would require checking
the following three facts:
Congruence Modulo n is an Equivalence Relation.
Given any integers a, b, and c, and any positive integer n, the
following hold:
1. a ≡ a (mod n).
2. If a ≡ b (mod n) then b ≡ a (mod n).
3. If a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n).
In other words, congruence modulo n is reflexive, symmetric,
and transitive, so is an equivalence relation.
You should take a minute to convince yourself that each of the properties above actually hold of congruence. Try explaining each using both
the remainder and divisibility definitions.
Next, consider how congruence behaves when doing basic arithmetic.
We already know that if you subtract two congruent numbers, the result
will be congruent to 0 (be a multiple of n). What if we add something
congruent to 1 to something congruent to 2? Will we get something
congruent to 3?
Congruence and Arithmetic.
Suppose a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n). Then the following
hold:

314

5. Additional Topics

1. a + c ≡ b + d (mod n).
2. a − c ≡ b − d (mod n).
3. ac ≡ bd (mod n).
The above facts might be written a little strangely, but the idea is
simple. If we have a true congruence, and we add the same thing to both
sides, the result is still a true congruence. This sounds like we are saying:
If a ≡ b (mod n) then a + c ≡ b + c (mod n).
Of course this is true as well, it is the special case where c  d. But
what we have works in more generality. Think of congruence as being
“basically equal.” If we have two numbers which are basically equal, and
we add basically the same thing to both sides, the result will be basically
equal.
This seems reasonable. Is it really true? Let’s prove the first fact:
Proof. Suppose a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n). That means a  b + kn
and c  d + jn for integers k and j. Add these equations:
a + c  b + d + kn + jn.
But kn + jn  (k + j)n, which is just a multiple of n. So a + c 
b + d + (j + k)n, or in other words, a + c ≡ b + d (mod n)
qed
The other two facts can be proved in a similar way.
One of the important consequences of these facts about congruences,
is that we can basically replace any number in a congruence with any
other number it is congruent to. Here are some examples to see how (and
why) that works:
Example 5.2.3

Find the remainder of 3491 divided by 9.
Solution. We could do long division, but there is another way.
We want to find x such that x ≡ 3491 (mod 9). Now 3491 
3000 + 400 + 90 + 1. Of course 90 ≡ 0 (mod 9), so we can replace the
90 in the sum with 0. Why is this okay? We are actually subtracting
the “same” thing from both sides:
x ≡ 3000 + 400 + 90 + 1

(mod 9)

− 0 ≡ 90 (mod 9)
x ≡ 3000 + 400 + 0 + 1 (mod 9).

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

315

Next, note that 400  4 · 100, and 100 ≡ 1 (mod 9) (since 9 | 99).
So we can in fact replace the 400 with simply a 4. Again, we are
appealing to our claim that we can replace congruent elements,
but we are really appealing to property 3 about the arithmetic of
congruence: we know 100 ≡ 1 (mod 9), so if we multiply both
sides by 4, we get 400 ≡ 4 (mod 9).
Similarly, we can replace 3000 with 3, since 1000  1 + 999 ≡ 1
(mod 9). So our original congruence becomes
x ≡ 3 + 4 + 0 + 1 (mod 9)
x ≡ 8 (mod 9).
Therefore 3491 divided by 9 has remainder 8.
The above example should convince you that the well known divisibility test for 9 is true: the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by
9 if and only if the original number is divisible by 9. In fact, we now
know something more: any number is congruent to the sum of its digits,
modulo 9.3
Let’s try another:
Example 5.2.4

Find the remainder when 3123 is divided by 7.
Solution. Of course, we are working with congruence because we
want to find the smallest positive x such that x ≡ 3123 (mod 7).
Now first write 3123  (33 )41 . We have:
3123  2741 ≡ 641

(mod 7),

since 27 ≡ 6 (mod 7). Notice further that 62  36 is congruent to 1
modulo 7. Thus we can simplify further:
641  6 · (62 )20 ≡ 6 · 120

(mod 7).

But 120  1, so we are done:
3123 ≡ 6 (mod 7).
3This works for 3 as well, but definitely not for any modulus in general.

316

5. Additional Topics

In the above example, we are using the fact that if a ≡ b (mod n), then
a p ≡ b p (mod n). This is just applying property 3 a bunch of times.
So far we have seen how to add, subtract and multiply with congruences. What about division? There is a reason we have waited to discuss
it. It turns out that we cannot simply divide. In other words, even if
ad ≡ bd (mod n), we do not know that a ≡ b (mod n). Consider, for
example:
18 ≡ 42 (mod 8).
This is true. Now 18 and 42 are both divisible by 6. However,
3 . 7 (mod 8).
While this doesn’t work, note that 3 ≡ 7 (mod 4). We cannot divide 8
by 6, but we can divide 8 by the greatest common factor of 8 and 6. Will
this always happen?
Suppose ad ≡ bd (mod n). In other words, we have ad  bd + kn for
some integer k. Of course ad is divisible by d, as is bd. So kn must also
be divisible by d. Now if n and d have no common factors (other than 1),
then we must have d | k. But in general, if we try to divide kn by d, we
don’t know that we will get an integer multiple of n. Some of the n might
get divided as well. To be safe, let’s divide as much of n as we can. Take
the largest factor of both d and n, and cancel that out from n. The rest of
the factors of d will come from k, no problem.
We will call the largest factor of both d and n the gcd(d, n), for greatest
common divisor. In our example above, gcd(6, 8)  2 since the greatest
divisor common to 6 and 8 is 2.
Congruence and Division.
n
Suppose ad ≡ bd (mod n). Then a ≡ b (mod gcd(d,n)
).
If d and n have no common factors then gcd(d, n)  1, so a ≡ b
(mod n).

Example 5.2.5

Simplify the following congruences using division: (a) 24 ≡ 39
(mod 5) and (b) 24 ≡ 39 (mod 15).
Solution. (a) Both 24 and 39 are divisible by 3, and 3 and 5 have
no common factors, so we get
8 ≡ 13 (mod 5).
(b) Again, we can divide by 3. However, doing so blindly gives
us 8 ≡ 13 (mod 15) which is no longer true. Instead, we must also
divide the modulus 15 by the greatest common factor of 3 and 15,

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

317

which is 3. Again we get
8 ≡ 13 (mod 5).

Solving Congruences
Now that we have some algebraic rules to govern congruence relations,
we can attempt to solve for an unknown in a congruence. For example, is
there a value of x that satisfies,
3x + 2 ≡ 4

(mod 5),

and if so, what is it?
In this example, since the modulus is small, we could simply try every
possible value for x. There are really only 5 to consider, since any integer
that satisfied the congruence could be replaced with any other integer it
was congruent to modulo 5. Here, when x  4 we get 3x + 2  14 which
is indeed congruent to 4 modulo 5. This means that x  9 and x  14 and
x  19 and so on will each also be a solution because as we saw above,
replacing any number in a congruence with a congruent number does not
change the truth of the congruence.
So in this example, simply compute 3x+2 for values of x ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
This gives 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 respectively, for which only 14 is congruent
to 4.
Let’s also see how you could solve this using our rules for the algebra
of congruences. Such an approach would be much simpler than the trial
and error tactic if the modulus was larger. First, we know we can subtract
2 from both sides:
3x ≡ 2 (mod 5).
Then to divide both sides by 3, we first add 0 to both sides. Of course,
on the right-hand side, we want that 0 to be a 10 (yes, 10 really is 0 since
they are congruent modulo 5). This gives,
3x ≡ 12 (mod 5).
Now divide both sides by 3. Since gcd(3, 5)  1, we do not need to
change the modulus:
x ≡ 4 (mod 5).
Notice that this in fact gives the general solution: not only can x  4,
but x can be any number which is congruent to 4. We can leave it like
this, or write “x  4 + 5k for any integer k.”

318

5. Additional Topics

Example 5.2.6

Solve the following congruences for x.
1. 7x ≡ 12 (mod 13).
2. 84x − 38 ≡ 79 (mod 15).
3. 20x ≡ 23 (mod 14).
Solution.
1. All we need to do here is divide both sides by 7. We add 13
to the right-hand side repeatedly until we get a multiple of 7
(adding 13 is the same as adding 0, so this is legal). We get
25, 38, 51, 64, 77 – got it. So we have:
7x ≡ 12 (mod 13)
7x ≡ 77 (mod 13)
x ≡ 11 (mod 13).
2. Here, since we have numbers larger than the modulus, we can
reduce them prior to applying any algebra. We have 84 ≡ 9,
38 ≡ 8 and 79 ≡ 4. Thus,
84x − 38 ≡ 79 (mod 15)
9x − 8 ≡ 4 (mod 15)
9x ≡ 12 (mod 15)
9x ≡ 72 (mod 15).
We got the 72 by adding 0 ≡ 60 (mod 15) to both sides of
the congruence. Now divide both sides by 9. However, since
gcd(9, 15)  3, we must divide the modulus by 3 as well:
x ≡ 8 (mod 5).
So the solutions are those values which are congruent to 8,
or equivalently 3, modulo 5. This means that in some sense
there are 3 solutions modulo 15: 3, 8, and 13. We can write
the solution:
x ≡ 3 (mod 15); x ≡ 8

(mod 15); x ≡ 13 (mod 15).

3. First, reduce modulo 14:
20x ≡ 23 (mod 14)

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

319

6x ≡ 9 (mod 14).
We could now divide both sides by 3, or try to increase 9 by a
multiple of 14 to get a multiple of 6. If we divide by 3, we get,
2x ≡ 3 (mod 14).
Now try adding multiples of 14 to 3, in hopes of getting a
number we can divide by 2. This will not work! Every time
we add 14 to the right side, the result will still be odd. We
will never get an even number, so we will never be able to
divide by 2. Thus there are no solutions to the congruence.
The last congruence above illustrates the way in which congruences
might not have solutions. We could have seen this immediately in fact.
Look at the original congruence:
20x ≡ 23 (mod 14).
If we write this as an equation, we get
20x  23 + 14k,
or equivalently 20x − 14k  23. We can easily see there will be no solution
to this equation in integers. The left-hand side will always be even, but the
right-hand side is odd. A similar problem would occur if the right-hand
side was divisible by any number the left-hand side was not.
So in general, given the congruence
ax ≡ b

(mod n),

if a and n are divisible by a number which b is not divisible by, then there
will be no solutions. In fact, we really only need to check one divisor of
a and n: the greatest common divisor. Thus, a more compact way to say
this is:
Congruences with no solutions.
If gcd(a, n) - b, then ax ≡ b (mod n) has no solutions.

Solving Linear Diophantine Equations
Discrete math deals with whole numbers of things. So when we want to
solve equations, we usually are looking for integer solutions. Equations
which are intended to only have integer solutions were first studied by in
the third century by the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria,

320

and as such are called Diophantine equations. Probably the most famous
example of a Diophantine equation is a 2 + b 2  c 2 . The integer solutions to this equation are called Pythagorean triples. In general, solving
Diophantine equations is hard (in fact, there is provably no general algorithm for deciding whether a Diophantine equation has a solution, a
result known as Matiyasevich’s Theorem). We will restrict our focus to
linear Diophantine equations, which are considerably easier to work with.
Diophantine Equations.
An equation in two or more variables is called a Diophantine equation if only integers solutions are of interest. A linear Diophantine
equation takes the form a 1 x1 + a 2 x x + · · · + a n x n  b for constants
a 1 , . . . , a n , b.
A solution to a Diophantine equation is a solution to the equation consisting only of integers.
We have the tools we need to solve linear Diophantine equations. We
will consider, as a main example, the equation
51x + 87y  123.
The general strategy will be to convert the equation to a congruence,
then solve that congruence.4 Let’s work this particular example to see
how this might go.
First, check if perhaps there are no solutions because a divisor of 51
and 87 is not a divisor of 123. Really, we just need to check whether
gcd(51, 87) | 123. This greatest common divisor is 3, and yes 3 | 123. At
this point, we might as well factor out this greatest common divisor. So
instead, we will solve:
17x + 29y  41.
Now observe that if there are going to be solutions, then for those
values of x and y, the two sides of the equation must have the same
remainder as each other, no matter what we divide by. In particular, if we
divide both sides by 17, we must get the same remainder. Thus we can
safely write
17x + 29y ≡ 41 (mod 17).
We choose 17 because 17x will have remainder 0. This will allow us to
reduce the congruence to just one variable. We could have also moved to
a congruence modulo 29, although there is usually a good reason to select
4This is certainly not the only way to proceed. A more common technique would be
to apply the Euclidean algorithm. Our way can be a little faster, and is presented here
primarily for variety.

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

321

the smaller choice, as this will allow us to reduce the other coefficient. In
our case, we reduce the congruence as follows:
17x + 29y ≡ 41 (mod 17)
0x + 12y ≡ 7

(mod 17)

12y ≡ 24 (mod 17)
y≡2

(mod 17).

Now at this point we know y  2 + 17k will work for any integer k. If
we haven’t made a mistake, we should be able to plug this back into our
original Diophantine equation to find x:
17x + 29(2 + 17k)  41
17x  −17 − 29 · 17k
x  −1 − 29k.
We have now found all solutions to the Diophantine equation. For
each k, x  −1 − 29k and y  2 + 17k will satisfy the equation. We
could check this for a few cases. If k  0, the solution is (−1, 2), and yes,
−17 + 2 · 29  41. If k  3, the solution is (−88, 53). If k  −2, we get
(57, −32).
To summarize this process, to solve ax + b y  c, we,
1. Divide both sides of the equation by gcd(a, b) (if this does not leave
the right-hand side as an integer, there are no solutions). Let’s
assume that ax + b y  c has already been reduced in this way.
2. Pick the smaller of a and b (here, assume it is b), and convert to a
congruence modulo b:
ax + b y ≡ c

(mod b).

This will reduce to a congruence with one variable, x:
ax ≡ c

(mod b).

3. Solve the congruence as we did in the previous section. Write your
solution as an equation, such as,
x  n + kb.
4. Plug this into the original Diophantine equation, and solve for y.
5. If we want to know solutions in a particular range (for example,
0 ≤ x, y ≤ 20), pick different values of k until you have all required
solutions.
Here is another example:

322

Example 5.2.7

How can you make $6.37 using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps? What
is the smallest and largest number of stamps you could use?
Solution. First, we need a Diophantine equation. We will work in
numbers of cents. Let x be the number of 5-cent stamps, and y be
the number of 8-cent stamps. We have:
5x + 8y  637.
Convert to a congruence and solve:
8y ≡ 367
3y ≡ 2

(mod 5)
(mod 5)

3y ≡ 12 (mod 5)
y≡4

(mod 5).

Thus y  4 + 5k. Then 5x + 8(4 + 5k)  637, so x  121 − 8k.
This says that one way to make $6.37 is to take 121 of the 5-cent
stamps and 4 of the 8-cent stamps. To find the smallest and largest
number of stamps, try different values of k.

This is no surprise. Having the most stamps means we have as
many 5-cent stamps as possible, and to get the smallest number of
stamps would require have the least number of 5-cent stamps. To
minimize the number of 5-cent stamps, we want to pick k so that
121 − 8k is as small as possible (but still positive). When k  15, we
have x  1 and y  79.
Therefore, to make $6.37, you can us as few as 80 stamps (1
5-cent stamp and 79 8-cent stamps) or as many as 125 stamps (121
5-cent stamps and 4 8-cent stamps).
Using this method, as long as you can solve linear congruences in one
variable, you can solve linear Diophantine equations of two variables.
There are times though that solving the linear congruence is a lot of work.

5.2. Introduction to Number Theory

323

For example, suppose you need to solve,
13x ≡ 6 (mod 51).
You could keep adding 51 to the right side until you get a multiple of
13: You would get 57, 108, 159, 210, 261, 312, and 312 is the first of these
that is divisible by 13. This works, but is really too much work. Instead
we could convert back to a Diophantine equation:
13x  6 + 51k.
Now solve this like we have in this section. Write it as a congruence
modulo 13:
0 ≡ 6 + 51k (mod 13)
−12k ≡ 6
2k ≡ −1

(mod 13)
(mod 13)

2k ≡ 12 (mod 13)
k≡6

(mod 13).

so k  6 + 13j. Now go back and figure out x:
13x  6 + 51(6 + 13j)
x  24 + 51j.
Of course you could do this switching back and forth between congruences and Diophantine equations as many times as you like. If you
only used this technique, you would essentially replicate the Euclidean
algorithm, a more standard way to solve Diophantine equations.

2.5.23. Here’s the idea: since every entry in Pascal’s Triangle is the sum
of the two entries above it, we can get the k + 1st row by adding up all
the pairs of entry from the kth row. But doing this uses each entry on
the kth row twice. Thus each time we drop to the next row, we double
the total. Of course, row 0 has sum 1  20 (the base case). Now try to

2.5.24. To see why this works, try it on a copy of Pascal’s triangle. We
are adding up the entries along a diagonal, starting with the 1 on the
left-hand side of the 4th row. Suppose we add up the first 5 entries on
this diagonal. The claim is that the sum is the entry below and to the left
of the last of these 5 entries. Note that if this is true, and we instead add
up the first 6 entries, we will need to add the entry one spot to the right
of the previous sum. But these two together give the entry below them,
which is below and left of the last of the 6 entries on the diagonal. If you
follow that, you can see what is going on. But it is not a great proof. A
formal induction proof is needed.

Then use the inductive hypothesis on the first summand, and distribute.
2.5.29. You will need three base cases. This is a very good hint actually,
as it suggests that to prove P(n) is true, you would want to use the fact

you need, but make sure to just give the relevant parts, and take care to
not use proof by contradiction.
4.2.9. You will need to remove a vertex of degree one, apply the inductive

4.2.10. If e is the root, then b will have three children (a, c, and d), all

4.4.10. The chromatic number is 4. Now prove this!
Note that you cannot use the 4-color theorem, or Brooke’s theorem,
or the clique number here. In fact, this graph, called the Grötzsch graph

triangles.
4.4.13. You can color K 5 in such a way that every vertex is adjacent to
exactly two blue edges and two red edges. However, there is a graph

generalize?

(a) This is not a statement. It is an imperative sentence, but is not either
true or false. It doesn’t matter that this might actually be the rule or
not. Note that “The rule is that all customers must wear shoes” is a
statement.
(b) This is a statement, as it is either true or false. It is an atomic
statement because it cannot be divided into smaller statements.
(c) This is again a statement, but this time it is molecular. In fact, it is
a conjunction, as we can write it as “The customers wore shoes and
the customers wore socks.”

(b) P → ¬Q.
(c) Jack passed math or Jill passed math (or both).
(d) If Jack and Jill did not both pass math, then Jill did.
(e)

i. Nothing else.
ii. Jack did not pass math either.

0.2.4.
(a) It is impossible to tell. The hypothesis of the implication is true.
Thus the implication will be true if the conclusion is true (if 13 is my
favorite number) and false otherwise.
(b) This is true, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or not. Any
implication with a true conclusion is true.
(c) This is true, again, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or
not. Any implication with a false hypothesis is true.
(d) For a disjunction to be true, we just need one or the other (or both)
of the parts to be true. Thus this is a true statement.
(e) We cannot tell. The statement would be true if 13 is my favorite
number, and false if not (since a conjunction needs both parts to be
true to be true).

B. Selected Solutions

(f) This is definitely false. 13 is prime, so its negation (13 is not prime)
is false. At least one part of the conjunction is false, so the whole
statement is false.
(g) This is true. Either 13 is my favorite number or it is not, but
whichever it is, at least one part of the disjunction is true, so the
whole statement is true.
0.2.5. The main thing to realize is that we don’t know the colors of these
two shapes, but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could
have a blue square and green triangle. We could have a square that was
not blue but a green triangle. Or we could have a square that was not blue
and a triangle that was not green. The case in which the square is blue but
the triangle is not green cannot occur, as that would make the statement
false.
(a) This must be false. In fact, this is the negation of the original implication.
(b) This might be true or might be false.
(c) True. This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is
logically equivalent to it.
(d) We do not know. This is the converse of the original statement. In
particular, if the square is not blue but the triangle is green, then the
original statement is true but the converse is false.
(e) True. This is logically equivalent to the original statement.
0.2.6. The only way for an implication P → Q to be true but its converse
to be false is for Q to be true and P to be false. Thus:
(a) False.
(b) True.
(c) False.
(d) True.
0.2.7. The converse is “If I will give you magic beans, then you will
give me a cow.” The contrapositive is “If I will not give you magic beans,
then you will not give me a cow.” All the other statements are neither the
converse nor contrapositive.

0.2.12.
P(5) is the statement “3 · 5 + 1 is even”, which is true. Thus
the statement ∃xP(x) is true (for example, 5 is such an x). However, we
cannot tell anything about ∀xP(x) since we do not know the truth value
of P(x) for all elements of the domain of discourse. In this case, ∀xP(x)
happens to be false (since P(4) is false, for example).
0.2.14.
(a) The claim that ∀xP(x) means that P(n) is true no matter what n you
consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove
that ∀xP(x) is true is to check or otherwise argue that P(n) is true
for all n in the domain.
(b) To prove ∀xP(x) is false all you need is one example of an element
in the domain for which P(n) is false. This is often called a counterexample.
(c) We are simply claiming that there is some element n in the domain
of discourse for which P(n) is true. If you can find one such element,
you have verified the claim.
(d) Here we are claiming that no element we find will make P(n) true.
The only way to be sure of this is to verify that every element of the
domain makes P(n) false. Note that the level of proof needed for
this statement is the same as to prove that ∀xP(x) is true.

(a) ∀x∃yP(x, y) is false because when x  4, there is no y which makes

we can always take x to be 3.
(c) ∃x∀yP(x, y) is true. In particular x  3 is such a number, so that no
matter what y is, P(x, y) is true.
(d) ∃y∀xP(x, y) is false. In fact, no matter what y (column) we look at,

(a) This is the set {3, 4, 5, . . .} since we need each element to be a natural
number whose square is at least three more than 2. Since 32 − 3  6
but 22 − 3  1 we see that the first such natural number is 3.

(b) Here we don’t specify that n must be a whole number at first, but the
condition we place on it, that n 2 − 5 ∈ N does guarantee this (since
square a non-integer always gives a non-integer, as does subtracting
5 from a non-integer). So in fact, we get the same set as we did in
the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which
n 2 − 5 is a natural numbers is 3.
Note that if we didn’t specify n ≥ 0 then any integer less than −3
would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.
(c) This is the set {1, 2, 5, 10, . . .}, namely the set of numbers that are
the result of squaring and adding 1 to a natural number. (02 + 1  1,
12 + 1  2, 22 + 1  5 and so on.) Thus the least element of the set is
1.
(d) Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking
some natural number, squaring it and adding 1. That is,
{1, 2, 5, 10, . . .}, the same set as the previous part. So again, the least
element is 1.

0.3.20. For example, A  {1, 2, 3, 4} and B  {5, 6, 7, 8, 9} gives A ∪ B 
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
0.3.28. We need to be a little careful here. If B contains 3 elements, then
A contains just the number 3 (listed twice). So that would make |A|  1,
which would make B  {1, 3}, which only has 2 elements. Thus |B| , 3.
This means that |A|  2, so B contains at least the elements 1 and 2. Since
|B| , 3, we must have |B|  2, which agrees with the definition of B.
Therefore it must be that A  {2, 3} and B  {1, 2}

(d) Such an element is 2 (in fact, that is the only element in the codomain

(a) f is injective, but not surjective (since 0, for example, is never an
output).
(b) f is injective and surjective. Unlike in the previous question, every
integers is an output (of the integer 4 less than it).
(c) f is injective, but not surjective (10 is not 8 less than a multiple of 5,
for example).
(d) f is not injective, but is surjective. Every integer is an output (of
twice itself, for example) but some integers are outputs of more than
one input: f (5)  3  f (6).
0.4.13.
(a) f is not injective. To prove this, we must simply find two different
elements of the domain which map to the same element of the
codomain. Since f ({1})  1 and f ({2})  1, we see that f is not
injective.
(b) f is not surjective. The largest subset of A is A itself, and |A|  10.
So no natural number greater than 10 will ever be an output.
(c) f −1 (1)  {{1}, {2}, {3}, . . . {10}} (the set of all the singleton subsets

(b) | f −1 (3)| ≥ 1. In other words, f −1 (3) is a set containing at least one
elements, possibly more. Surjective functions must have something

(c) | f −1 (3)|  1. There is exactly one element from X which gets
mapped to 3, so f −1 (3) is the set containing that one element.
0.4.17. X can really be any set, as long as f (x)  0 or f (x)  1 for every

0.4.21.
(a) f is injective.
Proof. Let x and y be elements of the domain Z. Assume f (x)  f (y).
If x and y are both even, then f (x)  x + 1 and f (y)  y + 1. Since
f (x)  f (y), we have x+1  y+1 which implies that x  y. Similarly,
if x and y are both odd, then x − 3  y − 3 so again x  y. The
only other possibility is that x is even an y is odd (or visa-versa).
But then x + 1 would be odd and y − 3 would be even, so it cannot
be that f (x)  f (y). Therefore if f (x)  f (y) we then have x  y,
which proves that f is injective.
qed
(b) f is surjective.
Proof. Let y be an element of the codomain Z. We will show there
is an element n of the domain (Z) such that f (n)  y. There are two
cases: First, if y is even, then let n  y + 3. Since y is even, n is odd,
so f (n)  n − 3  y + 3 − 3  y as desired. Second, if y is odd, then
let n  y − 1. Since y is odd, n is even, so f (n)  n + 1  y − 1 + 1  y
as needed. Therefore f is surjective.

0.4.22. Yes, this is a function, if you choose the domain and codomain
correctly. The domain will be the set of students, and the codomain will
be the set of possible grades. The function is almost certainly not injective,
because it is likely that two students will get the same grade. The function
might be surjective – it will be if there is at least one student who gets
each grade.
0.4.24. This is not a function.
0.4.25. The recurrence relation is f (n + 1)  f (n) + n.
0.4.26.
In general, |A| ≥ f (A) , since you cannot get more outputs
than you have inputs (each input goes to exactly one output), but you
could have fewer outputs if the function is not injective. If the function
is injective, then |A|  f (A) , although you can have equality even if f is
not injective (it must be injective restricted to A).

B. Selected Solutions

0.4.27. In general, there is no relationship between |B| and f −1 (B) . This
is because B might contain elements that are not in the range of f , so we
might even have f −1 (B)  ∅. On the other hand, there might be lots of
elements from the domain that all get sent to a few elements in B, making
f −1 (B) larger than B.
More specifically, if f is injective, then |B| ≥ f −1 (B) (since every
element in B must come from at most one element from the domain). If
f is surjective, then |B| ≤ f −1 (B) (since every element in B must come
from at least one element of the domain). Thus if f is bĳective then
|B|  f −1 (B) .

order in which the three numbers appears matters. There are P(40, 3) 
40 · 39 · 38 different possibilities for the “combination”. This is assuming
you cannot repeat any of the numbers (if you could, the answer would be
403 ).
1.3.3.
(a) This is just the multiplicative principle. There are 7 digits which we
can select for each of the 5 positions, so we have 75  16807 such
numbers.
(b) Now we have 7 choices for the first number, 6 for the second, etc. So
there are 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3  P(7, 5)  2520 such numbers.
(c) To build such a number we simply must select 5 different digits.
After doing so, there will only be one way to arrange them into a
5-digit number. Thus there are 75  21 such numbers.
(d) The permutation is in part (b), while the combination is in part (c).
At first this seems backwards, since usually we use combinations
for when order does not matter. Here it looks like in part (c) that
order does matter. The better way to distinguish between combinations and permutations is to ask whether we are counting different
arrangements as different outcomes. In part (c), there is only one
arrangement of any set of 5 digits, while in part (b) each set of 5
digits gives 5! different outcomes.

Answer 2: There are three choices for the first letter and two choices
for the second letter, for a total of 3 · 2.
Since the two answers are both answers to the same question, they are

Proof. Question: You have a large container filled with ping-pong balls, all
with a different number on them. You must select k of the balls, putting
two of them in a jar and the others in a box. How many ways can you do
this?
Answer 1: First select 2 of the n balls to put in the jar. Then select
k − 2 of the remaining
n − 2 balls to put in the box. The
first task can be
n

completed in 2 different ways, the second task in k−2 ways. Thus there

Answer 2: First select k balls from the n in the container. Then pick 2
of the k balls you picked to put in the jar, placing
the remaining k − 2 in

1.5.3.
(a) You take 3 strawberry, 1 lime, 0 licorice, 2 blueberry and 0 bubblegum.
(b) This is backwards. We don’t want the stars to represent the kids
because the kids are not identical, but the stars are. Instead we
should use 5 stars (for the lollipops) and use 5 bars to switch between
the 6 kids. For example,
∗ ∗ || ∗ ∗ ∗ |||
would represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops,
the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.
(c) This is the word AAAEOO.
(d) This doesn’t represent a solution. Each star should represent one of
the 6 units that add up to 6, and the bars should switch between the
different variables. We have one too many bars. An example of a
correct diagram would be

(a) You are giving your professor 4 types of cookies coming from 10
different types of cookies. This does not lend itself well to a function
interpretation. We could say that the domain contains the 4 types
you will give your professor and the codomain contains the 10 you
can choose from, but then counting injections would be too much
(it doesn’t matter if you pick type 3 first and type 2 second, or the
other way around, just that you pick those two types).
(b) We want to consider injective functions from the set {most, second
most, second least, least} to the set of 10 cookie types. We want
injections because we cannot pick the same type of cookie to give
most and least of (for example).

(c) This is not a good problem to interpret as a function. The problem is
that the domain would have to be the 12 cookies you bake, but these
elements are indistinguishable (there is not a first cookie, second
cookie, etc.).
(d) The domain should be the 12 shapes, the codomain the 10 types of
cookies. Since we can use the same type for different shapes, we are
interested in counting all functions here.
(e) Here we insist that each type of cookie be given at least once, so
now we are asking for the number of surjections of those functions
counted in the previous part.

(a) Note that if we subtract 1 from each term, we get the familiar triangular numbers. Thus a n  n 2 + 1.
(b) These look like the triangular numbers, only shifted by 1. We get:
n(n+1)
a n  2 − 1.
(c) If you subtract 2 from each term, you get triangular numbers, only
starting with 6 instead of 1. So we must shift vertically and horizon(n+2)(n+3)
tally. a n 

(d) These seem to grow very quickly. Further, if we add 1 to each term,
we find the factorials, although starting with 2 instead of 1. This

(b) This is a recursive definition. We continue a 2  2, a 3  3, a 4  4,

(c) We have a 0  1, a 1  1, a 2  2, a 3  6, a 4  24, a 5  120, and so on.

2.1.7. 3, 10, 24, 52, 108, . . .. The recursive definition for 10, 24, 52, . . . is

2.1.9.
This closed formula would have a n−1  3 · 2n−1 + 7 · 5n−1 and
a n−2  3 · 2n−2 + 7 · 5n−2 . Then we would have
7a n−1 − 10a n−2 7(3 · 2n−1 + 7 · 5n−1 ) − 10(3 · 2n−2 + 7 · 5n−2 )
21 · 2n−1 + 49 · 5n−1 − 30 · 2n−2 − 70 · 5n−2 )

6 · 2n−1 + 35 · 5n−1
3 · 2n + 7 · 5n  a n .
So the closed formula agrees with the recurrence relation. The closed
formula has initial terms a 0  10 and a 1  41.

Note that this is linear (arithmetic). We can check that we are correct. The
sequence a n is 4, 8, 14, 22, 32, . . . and the sequence of differences is thus
4, 6, 8, 10, . . . which agrees with 2n + 2 (if we start at n  1).

a n − a n−1  2an − a + b, which is arithmetic. Notice that this is not quite
the derivative of a n , which would be 2an + b, but it is close.
2.3.10.
No. The sequence of differences is the same as the original
sequence so no differences will be constant.
2.3.11. No. The sequence is geometric, and in fact has closed formula
2·3n . This is an exponential function, which is not equal to any polynomial
of any degree. If the nth sequence of differences was constant, then the
closed formula for the original sequence would be a degree n polynomial.

2.5.1.
(a) If we have a number of beans ending in a 5 and we double it, we
will get a number of beans ending in a 0 (since 5 · 2  10 ). Then if
we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a
5. Thus if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day
will also have a number ending in a 5.
(b) If you don’t start with a number of beans ending in a 5 (on day 1),
the above reasoning is still correct but not helpful. For example, if
you start with a number ending in a 3, the next day you will have a
number ending in a 1.
(c) Part (b) is the base case and part (a) is the inductive case. If on day
1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)), then on day 2 we
will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)). Then by part (a)
again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3. By part (a)
again, this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4
The proof by induction would say that on every day we will have a
number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the
base case, then use the inductive case over and over until we get up
to our desired n.

Proof. We must prove that 1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + · · · + 2n  2n+1 − 1 for all n ∈ N.
Thus let P(n) be the statement 1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2n  2n+1 − 1. We will
prove that P(n) is true for all n ∈ N. First we establish the base case, P(0),
which claims that 1  20+1 − 1. Since 21 − 1  2 − 1  1, we see that P(0) is
true. Now for the inductive case. Assume that P(k) is true for an arbitrary
k ∈ N. That is, 1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2k  2k+1 − 1. We must show that P(k + 1)
is true (i.e., that 1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2k+1  2k+2 − 1). To do this, we start with
the left-hand side of P(k + 1) and work to the right-hand side:

P(n) is true for all n ∈ N. First we establish the base case, P(0). Since
70 − 1  0, and 0 is a multiple of 6, P(0) is true. Now for the inductive case.
Assume P(k) holds for an arbitrary k ∈ N. That is, 7k − 1 is a multiple of 6,
or in other words, 7k − 1  6j for some integer j. Now consider 7k+1 − 1:

have 1  12 which is true, so P(1) is established. Now the inductive
case. Assume that P(k) is true for some fixed arbitrary k ≥ 1. That is,
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2k − 1)  k 2 . We will now prove that P(k + 1) is also true
(i.e., that 1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2k + 1)  (k + 1)2 ). We start with the left-hand
side of P(k + 1) and work to the right-hand side:

F0  0 and F1  1 so F0  F1 −1. Now consider the inductive case. Assume
P(k) is true, that is, assume F0 + F2 + F4 + · · · + F2k  F2k+1 − 1. To establish
P(k + 1) we work from left to right:

Proof. Let P(n) be the statement 2n < n!. We will show P(n) is true for all

so P(4) is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume P(k) is true for an
arbitrary k ≥ 4. That is, 2k < k!. Now consider P(k + 1): 2k+1 < (k + 1)!.
To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.
2k+1  2 · 2k
< 2 · k!
< (k + 1) · k!

by the inductive hypothesis
since k + 1 > 2

course, when n  0, 0 + 3 , 0 + 7.
2.5.13.
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement that n + 3 < n + 7. We will prove that P(n)
is true for all n ∈ N. First, note that the base case holds: 0 + 3 < 0 + 7. Now
assume for induction that P(k) is true. That is, k + 3 < k + 7. We must
show that P(k + 1) is true. Now since k + 3 < k + 7, add 1 to both sides.
This gives k + 3 + 1 < k + 7 + 1. Regrouping (k + 1) + 3 < (k + 1) + 7. But
this is simply P(k + 1). Thus by the principle of mathematical induction
P(n) is true for all n ∈ N.
qed
2.5.14. The problem here is that while P(0) is true, and while P(k) →
P(k + 1) for some values of k, there is at least one value of k (namely k  99)
when that implication fails. For a valid proof by induction, P(k) → P(k+1)
must be true for all values of k greater than or equal to the base case.
2.5.16. We once again failed to establish the base case: when n  0,
n 2 + n  0 which is even, not odd.
2.5.19. The proof will by by strong induction.
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement “n is either a power of 2 or can be written
as the sum of distinct powers of 2.” We will show that P(n) is true for all
n ≥ 1.
Base case: 1  20 is a power of 2, so P(1) is true.
Inductive case: Suppose P(k) is true for all k < n. Now if n is a power
of 2, we are done. If not, let 2x be the largest power of 2 strictly less than
n. Consider n − 2x , which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both n
and 2x . Thus n − 2x is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of

Selected Solutions

distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be 2x , so the together
with 2x we have written n as the sum of distinct powers of 2.
Therefore, by the principle of (strong) mathematical induction, P(n)
is true for all n ≥ 1.
qed
2.5.25. The idea here is that if we take the logarithm of a n , we can increase
n by 1 if we multiply by another a (inside the logarithm). This results in
adding 1 more log(a) to the total.
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement log(a n )  n log(a). The base case, P(2)
is true, because log(a 2 )  log(a · a)  log(a) + log(a)  2 log(a), by the
product rule for logarithms. Now assume, for induction, that P(k) is true.
That is, log(a k )  k log(a). Consider log(a k+1 ). We have
log(a k+1 )  log(a k · a)  log(a k ) + log(a)  k log(a) + log(a),
with the last equality due to the inductive hypothesis. But this simplifies to (k + 1) log(a), establishing P(k + 1). Therefore by the principle of
mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 2.

(a) On the first day, your 2 mini bunnies become 2 large bunnies. On
day 2, your two large bunnies produce 4 mini bunnies. On day 3, you
have 4 mini bunnies (produced by your 2 large bunnies) plus 6 large
bunnies (your original 2 plus the 4 newly matured bunnies). On day
4, you will have 12 mini bunnies (2 for each of the 6 large bunnies)
plus 10 large bunnies (your previous 6 plus the 4 newly matured).
The sequence of total bunnies is 2, 2, 6, 10, 22, 42 . . . starting with
a 0  2 and a 1  2.
(b) a n  a n−1 + 2a n−2 . This is because the number of bunnies is equal
to the number of bunnies you had the previous day (both mini and
large) plus 2 times the number you had the day before that (since
all bunnies you had 2 days ago are now large and producing 2 new
bunnies each).
(c) Using the characteristic root technique, we find a n  a2n + b(−1)n ,
and we can find a and b to give a n  34 2n + 32 (−1)n .
2.6.17. Let P(n) be the statement, “every set containing n elements has
2n different subsets.” We will show P(n) is true for all n ≥ 1. Base
case: Any set with 1 element {a} has exactly 2 subsets: the empty set and
the set itself. Thus the number of subsets is 2  21 . Thus P(1) is true.
Inductive case: Suppose P(k) is true for some arbitrary k ≥ 1. Thus every
set containing exactly k elements has 2k different subsets. Now consider
a set containing k + 1 elements: A  {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a k , a k+1 }. Any subset of
A must either contain a k+1 or not. In other words, a subset of A is just a
subset of {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a k } with or without a k+1 . Thus there are 2k subsets of
A which contain a k+1 and another 2k+1 subsets of A which do not contain
a k+1 . This gives a total of 2k + 2k  2 · 2k  2k+1 subsets of A. But our
choice of A was arbitrary, so this works for any subset containing k + 1
elements, so P(k + 1) is true. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical
induction, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 1.

contrapositive.
Proof. Suppose that each number only came up 6 or fewer times. So
there are at most six 1’s, six 2’s, and so on. That’s a total of 36 dice,
so you must not have rolled all 40 dice.

(b) We can have 9 dice without any four matching or any four being all

different.
Proof. Suppose you roll 10 dice, but that there are NOT four matching
rolls. This means at most, there are three of any given value. If we
only had three different values, that would be only 9 dice, so there
must be 4 different values, giving 4 dice that are all different. qed

(a) The statement is true. If n is an even integer less than or equal to 7,
then the only way it could not be negative is if n was equal to 0, 2, 4,
or 6.
(b) There is an integer n such that n is even and n ≤ 7 but n is not negative and n < {0, 2, 4, 6}. This is false, since the original statement is
true.
(c) For all integers n, if n is not negative and n < {0, 2, 4, 6} then n is
odd or n > 7. This is true, since the contrapositive is equivalent to
the original statement (which is true).
(d) For all integers n, if n is negative or n ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6} then n is even
and n ≤ 7. This is false. n  −3 is a counterexample.
3.3.7.
(a) For any number x, if it is the case that adding any number to x gives
that number back, then multiplying any number by x will give 0.
This is true (of the integers or the reals). The “if” part only holds if
x  0, and in that case, anything times x will be 0.
(b) The converse in words is this: for any number x, if everything times
x is zero, then everything added to x gives itself. Or in symbols:
∀x(∀z(x · z  0) → ∀y(x + y  y)). The converse is true: the
only number which when multiplied by any other number gives 0
is x  0. And if x  0, then x + y  y.
(c) The contrapositive in words is: for any number x, if there is some
number which when multiplied by x does not give zero, then there
is some number which when added to x does not give that number.
In symbols: ∀x(∃z(x · z , 0) → ∃y(x + y , y)). We know the
contrapositive must be true because the original implication is true.
(d) The negation: there is a number x such that any number added to x
gives the number back again, but there is a number you can multiply
x by and not get 0. In symbols: ∃x(∀y(x + y  y) ∧ ∃z(x · z , 0)).
Of course since the original implication is true, the negation is false.

Proof. Let n be an integer. Assume n is odd. So n  2k + 1 for some
integer k. Then
7n  7(2k + 1)  14k + 7  2(7k + 3) + 1.
Since 7k + 3 is an integer, we see that 7n is odd.

qed

(b) The converse is: for all integers n, if 7n is odd, then n is odd. We
will prove this by contrapositive.
Proof. Let n be an integer. Assume n is not odd. Then n  2k for
some integer k. So 7n  14k  2(7k) which is to say 7n is even.
Therefore 7n is not odd.

3.3.10.
(a) Suppose you only had 5 coins of each denomination. This means
you have 5 pennies, 5 nickels, 5 dimes and 5 quarters. This is a total
of 20 coins. But you have more than 20 coins, so you must have
more than 5 of at least one type.
(b) Suppose you have 22 coins, including 2k nickels, 2j dimes, and 2l
quarters (so an even number of each of these three types of coins).
The number of pennies you have will then be
22 − 2k − 2 j − 2l  2(11 − k − j − l).
But this says that the number of pennies is also even (it is 2 times
an integer). Thus we have established the contrapositive of the
statement, “If you have an odd number of pennies then you have an
odd number of at least one other coin type.”
(c) You need 10 coins. You could have 3 pennies, 3 nickels, and 3 dimes.
The 10th coin must either be a quarter, giving you 4 coins that are
all different, or else a 4th penny, nickel or dime. To prove this,
assume you don’t have 4 coins that are all the same or all different.
In particular, this says that you only have 3 coin types, and each of
those types can only contain 3 coins, for a total of 9 coins, which is
less than 10.

4.1.2. It is possible for everyone to be friends with exactly 2 people. You
could arrange the 5 people in a circle and say that everyone is friends
with the two people on either side of them (so you get the graph C 5 ).
However, it is not possible for everyone to be friends with 3 people. That
would lead to a graph with an odd number of odd degree vertices which
is impossible since the sum of the degrees must be even.
4.1.4. The graphs are not equal. For example, graph 1 has an edge {a, b}
but graph 2 does not have that edge. They are isomorphic. One possible

then every vertex must be adjacent to every other vertex. This is the

4.2.2.
(a) This must be the degree sequence for a tree. This is because the
vertex of degree 4 must be adjacent to the four vertices of degree 1
(there are no other vertices for it to be adjacent to), and thus we get
a star.
(b) This cannot be a tree. Each degree 3 vertex is adjacent to all but one
of the vertices in the graph. Thus each must be adjacent to one of
the degree 1 vertices (and not the other). That means both degree
3 vertices are adjacent to the degree 2 vertex, and to each other, so
that means there is a cycle.
Alternatively, count how many edges there are!
(c) This might or might not be a tree. The length 4 path has this degree
sequence (this is a tree), but so does the union of a 3-cycle and a
length 1 path (which is not connected, so not a tree).
(d) This cannot be a tree. The sum of the degrees is 28, so there are 14
edges. But there are 14 vertices as well, so we don’t have v  e + 1,
meaning this cannot be a tree.
4.2.6. Yes. We will prove the contrapositive. Assume G does not contain
a cycle. Then G is a tree, so would have v  e + 1, contrary to stipulation.
4.2.12.
(a) No, although there are graphs for which this is true. For example,
K 4 has a spanning tree that is a path (of three edges) and also a
spanning tree that is a star (with center vertex of degree 3).
(b) Yes. For a fixed graph, we have a fixed number v of vertices. Any
spanning tree of the graph will also have v vertices, and since it is a
tree, must have v − 1 edges.
(c) No, although there are graph for which this is true (note that if all
spanning trees are isomorphic, then all spanning trees will have
the same number of leaves). Again, K4 is a counterexample. One
spanning tree is a path, with only two leaves, another spanning tree
is a star with 3 leaves.

draw a graph with those vertex degrees without edges crossing. This can
be done by trial and error (and is possible).
4.3.6. Say the last polyhedron has n edges, and also n vertices. The total
number of edges the polyhedron has then is (7 · 3 + 4 · 4 + n)/2  (37 + n)/2.
In particular, we know the last face must have an odd number of edges. We
also have that v  11. By Euler’s formula, we have 11 − (37 + n)/2 + 12  2,
and solving for n we get n  5, so the last face is a pentagon.
4.3.8.
Proof. Let P(n) be the statement, “every connected planar graph containing n edges satisfies v − n + f  2.” We will show P(n) is true for all
n ≥ 0.
Base case: there is only one graph with zero edges, namely a single
isolated vertex. In this case v  1, f  1 and e  0, so Euler’s formula
holds.
Inductive case: Suppose P(k) is true for some arbitrary k ≥ 0. Now
consider an arbitrary graph containing k + 1 edges (and v vertices and f
faces). No matter what this graph looks like, we can remove a single edge
to get a graph with k edges which we can apply the inductive hypothesis
to.
There are two cases: either the graph contains a cycle or it does not.
If the graph contains a cycle, then pick an edge that is part of this cycle,
and remove it. This will not disconnect the graph, and will decrease the
number of faces by 1 (since the edge was bordering two distinct faces). So
by the inductive hypothesis we will have v − k + f − 1  2. Adding the
edge back will give v − (k + 1) + f  2 as needed.
If the graph does not contain a cycle, then it is a tree, so has a vertex
of degree 1. Then we can pick the edge to remove to be incident to such a
degree 1 vertex. In this case, also remove that vertex. The smaller graph
will now satisfy v − 1 − k + f  2 by the induction hypothesis (removing
the edge and vertex did not reduce the number of faces). Adding the edge
and vertex back gives v − (k + 1) + f  2, as required.
Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, Euler’s formula
holds for all planar graphs.
qed
4.3.12.
Proof. We know in any planar graph the number of faces f satisfies 3 f ≤ 2e

Since it would be impossible to color the vertices with a single color,

4.4.9. The wheel graph below has this property. The outside of the wheel
forms an odd cycle, so requires 3 colors, the center of the wheel must be
different than all the outside vertices.

4.4.12. If we drew a graph with each letter representing a vertex, and
each edge connecting two letters that were consecutive in the alphabet, we
would have a graph containing two vertices of degree 1 (A and Z) and the
remaining 24 vertices all of degree 2 (for example, D would be adjacent
to both C and E). By Brooks’ theorem, this graph has chromatic number
at most 2, as that is the maximal degree in the graph and the graph is not
a complete graph or odd cycle. Thus only two boxes are needed.

(c) The degree sequence for G is (3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 11).
(d) In general this should be possible: the degree sequence does not
determine the graph’s isomorphism class. However, in this case, I

(g) The chromatic number of G is 2. It shouldn’t be hard to give a 2coloring (for example, color a, d, e, g red and b, c, f blue), but we
know that all bipartite graphs have chromatic number 2.

The only such graph is C 10 .
4.7.7.
(a) Only if n ≥ 6 and is even.
(b) None.

(c) 12. Such a graph would have 5n
2 edges. If the graph is planar, then
5n
n − 2 + f  2 so there would be 4+3n
faces. Also, we must
2
 have
3 f ≤ 2e, since the graph is simple. So we must have 3 4+3n
≤ 5n.

Solving for n gives n ≥ 12.

(a) There were 24 couples: 6 choices for the girl and 4 choices for the
boy.
(b) There were 45 couples:
people to dance together.

since we must choose two of the 10

(c) For part (a), we are counting the number of edges in K 4,6 . In part (b)
we count the edges of K 10 .
4.7.9. Yes, as long as n is even. If n were odd, then corresponding graph
would have an odd number of odd degree vertices, which is impossible.
4.7.10.
(a) No. The 9 triangles each contribute 3 edges, and the 6 pentagons
contribute 5 edges. This gives a total of 57, which is exactly twice
the number of edges, since each edge borders exactly 2 faces. But 57
is odd, so this is impossible.
(b) Now adding up all the edges of all the 16 polygons gives a total of
64, meaning there would be 32 edges in the polyhedron. We can
then use Euler’s formula v − e + f  2 to deduce that there must be
18 vertices.
(c) If you add up all the vertices from each polygon separately, we
get a total of 64. This is not divisible by 3, so it cannot be that
each vertex belongs to exactly 3 faces. Could they all belong to 4
faces? That would mean there were 64/4  16 vertices, but we know
from Euler’s formula that there must be 18 vertices. We can write
64  3x + 4y and solve for x and y (as integers). We get that there
must be 10 vertices with degree 4 and 8 with degree 3. (Note the
number of faces joined at a vertex is equal to its degree in graph
theoretic terms.)
4.7.11. No. Every polyhedron can be represented as a planar graph,
and the Four Color Theorem says that every planar graph has chromatic
number at most 4.
4.7.12. K n,n has n 2 edges. The graph will have an Euler circuit when n is
even. The graph will be planar only when n < 3.

4.7.13. G has 8 edges (since the sum of the degrees is 16). If G is planar,
then it will have 4 faces (since 6 − 8 + 4  2). G does not have an Euler
path since there are more than 2 vertices of odd degree.
4.7.14. 7 colors. Thus K7 is not planar (by the contrapositive of the Four
Color Theorem).
4.7.15. The chromatic number of K 3,4 is 2, since the graph is bipartite.
You cannot say whether the graph is planar based on this coloring (the
converse of the Four Color Theorem is not true). In fact, the graph is not
planar, since it contains K 3,3 as a subgraph.
4.7.16. We have that K 3,4 has 7 vertices and 12 edges (each vertex in
the group of 3 has degree 4). Then by Euler’s formula we have that
7 − 12 + f  2 so if the graph were planar, it would have f  7 faces.
However, since the girth of the graph is 4 (there are no cycles of length 3)
we get that 4 f ≤ 2e. But this would mean that 28 ≤ 24, a contradiction.
4.7.17. For all these questions, we are really coloring the vertices of a
graph. You get the graph by first drawing a planar representation of the
polyhedron and then taking its planar dual: put a vertex in the center of
each face (including the outside) and connect two vertices if their faces
share an edge.
(a) Since the planar dual of a dodecahedron contains a 5-wheel, it’s
chromatic number is at least 4. Alternatively, suppose you could
color the faces using 3 colors without any two adjacent faces colored
the same. Take any face and color it blue. The 5 pentagons bordering
this blue pentagon cannot be colored blue. Color the first one red.
Its two neighbors (adjacent to the blue pentagon) get colored green.
The remaining 2 cannot be blue or green, but also cannot both be
red since they are adjacent to each other. Thus a 4th color is needed.
(b) The planar dual of the dodecahedron is itself a planar graph. Thus
by the 4-color theorem, it can be colored using only 4 colors without
two adjacent vertices (corresponding to the faces of the polyhedron)
being colored identically.
(c) The cube can be properly 3-colored. Color the “top” and “bottom”
red, the “front” and “back” blue, and the “left” and “right” green.
4.7.18.
(a) False. To prove this, we can give an example of a pair of graphs with
the same chromatic number that are not isomorphic. For example,
K 3,3 and K 3,4 both have chromatic number 2, but are not isomorphic.
(b) False. The previous example does not work, but you can easily draw
two trees that have the same number of vertices and edges but are

382

B. Selected Solutions

not isomorphic. Since all trees have chromatic number 2, this is a
counterexample.
(c) True. If there is an isomorphism from G1 to G2 , then we have a
bĳection that tells us how to match up vertices between the graph.
Any proper vertex coloring of G1 will tell us how to properly color
G2 , simply by coloring f (v i ) the same color as v i , for each vertex
v i ∈ V. That is, color the vertices in G2 exactly how you color the
corresponding vertices in G1 . Similarly, any proper vertex coloring
of G2 corresponds to a proper vertex coloring of G1 . Thus the
smallest number of colors needed to properly color G1 cannot be
smaller than the smallest number of colors needed to properly color
G2 , and vice-versa, so the chromatic numbers must be equal.
4.7.19. G has 13 edges, since we need 7 − e + 8  2.
4.7.20.
(a) The graph does have an Euler path, but not an Euler circuit. There
are exactly two vertices with odd degree. The path starts at one and
ends at the other.
(b) The graph is planar. Even though as it is drawn edges cross, it is
easy to redraw it without edges crossing.
(c) The graph is not bipartite (there is an odd cycle), nor complete.
(d) The chromatic number of the graph is 3.
4.7.21.
(a) False. For example, K 3,3 is not planar.
(b) True. The graph is bipartite so it is possible to divide the vertices
into two groups with no edges between vertices in the same group.
Thus we can color all the vertices of one group red and the other
group blue.
(c) False. K 3,3 has 6 vertices with degree 3, so contains no Euler path.
(d) False. K 3,3 again.
(e) False. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is even for all graphs so
this property does not imply that the graph is bipartite.
4.7.22.
(a) If a graph has an Euler path, then it is planar.
(b) If a graph does not have an Euler path, then it is not planar.
(c) There is a graph which is planar and does not have an Euler path.
(d) Yes. In fact, in this case it is because the original statement is false.

Proof. Assume a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n). This means a  b + kn

a − c  b + kn − (d + jn)  b − d + (k − j)n.

5.2.14. We must solve 7x +5 ≡ 2 (mod 11). This gives x ≡ 9 (mod 11). In
general, x  9 + 11k, but when you divide any such x by 11, the remainder
will be 9.
5.2.15. Divide through by 2: 3x + 5y  16. Convert to a congruence,
modulo 3: 5y ≡ 16 (mod 3), which reduces to 2y ≡ 1 (mod 3). So y ≡ 2
(mod 3) or y  2 + 3k. Plug this back into 3x + 5y  16 and solve for x,
to get x  2 − 5k. So the general solution is x  2 − 5k and y  2 + 3k for
k ∈ Z.
