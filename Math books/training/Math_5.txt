This text was initially written by David Guichard. The single variable material in chapters 1–9 is a modification and expansion of notes written by Neal Koblitz at the University of Washington, who generously
gave permission to use, modify, and distribute his work. New material has been added, and old material
has been modified, so some portions now bear little resemblance to the original.
The book includes some exercises and examples from Elementary Calculus: An Approach Using Infinitesimals, by H. Jerome Keisler, available at http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html under a Creative
Commons license. In addition, the chapter on diﬀerential equations (in the multivariable version) and the
section on numerical integration are largely derived from the corresponding portions of Keisler’s book.
Albert Schueller, Barry Balof, and Mike Wills have contributed additional material.

I will be glad to receive corrections and suggestions for improvement at guichard@whitman.edu.

Introduction

The emphasis in this course is on problems—doing calculations and story problems. To
master problem solving one needs a tremendous amount of practice doing problems. The
more problems you do the better you will be at doing them, as patterns will start to emerge
in both the problems and in successful approaches to them. You will learn fastest and best
if you devote some time to doing problems every day.
Typically the most diﬃcult problems are story problems, since they require some eﬀort
before you can begin calculating. Here are some pointers for doing story problems:
1. Carefully read each problem twice before writing anything.
2. Assign letters to quantities that are described only in words; draw a diagram if
appropriate.
3. Decide which letters are constants and which are variables. A letter stands for a
constant if its value remains the same throughout the problem.
4. Using mathematical notation, write down what you know and then write down
what you want to find.
5. Decide what category of problem it is (this might be obvious if the problem comes
at the end of a particular chapter, but will not necessarily be so obvious if it comes
on an exam covering several chapters).
6. Double check each step as you go along; don’t wait until the end to check your
work.
7. Use common sense; if an answer is out of the range of practical possibilities, then
check your work to see where you went wrong.

12 Introduction
Suggestions for Using This Text
1. Read the example problems carefully, filling in any steps that are left out (ask
someone for help if you can’t follow the solution to a worked example).
2. Later use the worked examples to study by covering the solutions, and seeing if
you can solve the problems on your own.
3. Most exercises have answers in Appendix A; the availability of an answer is marked
by “⇒” at the end of the exercise. In the pdf version of the full text, clicking
on the arrow will take you to the answer. The answers should be used only as
a final check on your work, not as a crutch. Keep in mind that sometimes an
answer could be expressed in various ways that are algebraically equivalent, so
don’t assume that your answer is wrong just because it doesn’t have exactly the
same form as the answer in the back.
4. A few figures in the pdf and print versions of the book are marked with “(AP)” at
the end of the caption. Clicking on this should open a related interactive applet
or Sage worksheet in your web browser. Occasionally another link will do the
same thing, like this example. (Note to users of a printed text: the words “this
example” in the pdf file are blue, and are a link to a Sage worksheet.)

Analytic Geometry

Much of the mathematics in this chapter will be review for you. However, the examples
will be oriented toward applications and so will take some thought.
In the (x, y) coordinate system we normally write the x-axis horizontally, with positive
numbers to the right of the origin, and the y-axis vertically, with positive numbers above
the origin. That is, unless stated otherwise, we take “rightward” to be the positive xdirection and “upward” to be the positive y-direction. In a purely mathematical situation,
we normally choose the same scale for the x- and y-axes. For example, the line joining the
origin to the point (a, a) makes an angle of 45◦ with the x-axis (and also with the y-axis).
In applications, often letters other than x and y are used, and often diﬀerent scales are
chosen in the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, suppose you drop something
from a window, and you want to study how its height above the ground changes from
second to second. It is natural to let the letter t denote the time (the number of seconds
since the object was released) and to let the letter h denote the height. For each t (say,
at one-second intervals) you have a corresponding height h. This information can be
tabulated, and then plotted on the (t, h) coordinate plane, as shown in figure 1.0.1.
We use the word “quadrant” for each of the four regions into which the plane is
divided by the axes: the first quadrant is where points have both coordinates positive,
or the “northeast” portion of the plot, and the second, third, and fourth quadrants are
counted oﬀ counterclockwise, so the second quadrant is the northwest, the third is the
southwest, and the fourth is the southeast.
Suppose we have two points A and B in the (x, y)-plane. We often want to know the
change in x-coordinate (also called the “horizontal distance”) in going from A to B. This

A data plot, height versus time.

is often written ∆x, where the meaning of ∆ (a capital delta in the Greek alphabet) is
“change in”. (Thus, ∆x can be read as “change in x” although it usually is read as “delta
x”. The point is that ∆x denotes a single number, and should not be interpreted as “delta
times x”.) For example, if A = (2, 1) and B = (3, 3), ∆x = 3 − 2 = 1. Similarly, the
“change in y” is written ∆y. In our example, ∆y = 3 − 1 = 2, the diﬀerence between the
y-coordinates of the two points. It is the vertical distance you have to move in going from
A to B. The general formulas for the change in x and the change in y between a point
(x1 , y1 ) and a point (x2 , y2 ) are:
∆x = x2 − x1 ,

∆y = y2 − y1 .

Note that either or both of these might be negative.
1.1

Lines

If we have two points A(x1 , y1 ) and B(x2 , y2 ), then we can draw one and only one line
through both points. By the slope of this line we mean the ratio of ∆y to ∆x. The slope
is often denoted m: m = ∆y/∆x = (y2 − y1 )/(x2 − x1 ). For example, the line joining the
points (1, −2) and (3, 5) has slope (5 + 2)/(3 − 1) = 7/2.
EXAMPLE 1.1.1 According to the 1990 U.S. federal income tax schedules, a head
of household paid 15% on taxable income up to $26050. If taxable income was between
$26050 and $134930, then, in addition, 28% was to be paid on the amount between $26050
and $67200, and 33% paid on the amount over $67200 (if any). Interpret the tax bracket

information (15%, 28%, or 33%) using mathematical terminology, and graph the tax on
the y-axis against the taxable income on the x-axis.
The percentages, when converted to decimal values 0.15, 0.28, and 0.33, are the slopes
of the straight lines which form the graph of the tax for the corresponding tax brackets.
The tax graph is what’s called a polygonal line, i.e., it’s made up of several straight line
segments of diﬀerent slopes. The first line starts at the point (0,0) and heads upward
with slope 0.15 (i.e., it goes upward 15 for every increase of 100 in the x-direction), until
it reaches the point above x = 26050. Then the graph “bends upward,” i.e., the slope
changes to 0.28. As the horizontal coordinate goes from x = 26050 to x = 67200, the line
goes upward 28 for each 100 in the x-direction. At x = 67200 the line turns upward again
and continues with slope 0.33. See figure 1.1.1.

The most familiar form of the equation of a straight line is: y = mx + b. Here m is the
slope of the line: if you increase x by 1, the equation tells you that you have to increase y
by m. If you increase x by ∆x, then y increases by ∆y = m∆x. The number b is called
the y-intercept, because it is where the line crosses the y-axis. If you know two points
on a line, the formula m = (y2 − y1 )/(x2 − x1 ) gives you the slope. Once you know a point
and the slope, then the y-intercept can be found by substituting the coordinates of either
point in the equation: y1 = mx1 + b, i.e., b = y1 − mx1 . Alternatively, one can use the
“point-slope” form of the equation of a straight line: start with (y − y1 )/(x − x1 ) = m and
then multiply to get (y − y1 ) = m(x − x1 ), the point-slope form. Of course, this may be
further manipulated to get y = mx − mx1 + y1 , which is essentially the “mx + b” form.
It is possible to find the equation of a line between two points directly from the relation
(y − y1 )/(x − x1 ) = (y2 − y1 )/(x2 − x1 ), which says “the slope measured between the point
(x1 , y1 ) and the point (x2 , y2 ) is the same as the slope measured between the point (x1 , y1 )

16 Chapter 1 Analytic Geometry
and any other point (x, y) on the line.” For example, if we want to find the equation of
the line joining our earlier points A(2, 1) and B(3, 3), we can use this formula:
y−1
3−1
=
= 2,
x−2
3−2

y − 1 = 2(x − 2),

so that

i.e.,

y = 2x − 3.

Of course, this is really just the point-slope formula, except that we are not computing m
in a separate step.
The slope m of a line in the form y = mx + b tells us the direction in which the line is
pointing. If m is positive, the line goes into the 1st quadrant as you go from left to right.
If m is large and positive, it has a steep incline, while if m is small and positive, then the
line has a small angle of inclination. If m is negative, the line goes into the 4th quadrant
as you go from left to right. If m is a large negative number (large in absolute value), then
the line points steeply downward; while if m is negative but near zero, then it points only
a little downward. These four possibilities are illustrated in figure 1.1.2.

Lines with slopes 3, 0.1, −4, and −0.1.

If m = 0, then the line is horizontal: its equation is simply y = b.
There is one type of line that cannot be written in the form y = mx + b, namely,
vertical lines. A vertical line has an equation of the form x = a. Sometimes one says that
a vertical line has an “infinite” slope.
Sometimes it is useful to find the x-intercept of a line y = mx + b. This is the x-value
when y = 0. Setting mx + b equal to 0 and solving for x gives: x = −b/m. For example,
the line y = 2x − 3 through the points A(2, 1) and B(3, 3) has x-intercept 3/2.
EXAMPLE 1.1.2 Suppose that you are driving to Seattle at constant speed, and notice
that after you have been traveling for 1 hour (i.e., t = 1), you pass a sign saying it is 110
miles to Seattle, and after driving another half-hour you pass a sign saying it is 85 miles
to Seattle. Using the horizontal axis for the time t and the vertical axis for the distance y
from Seattle, graph and find the equation y = mt + b for your distance from Seattle. Find
the slope, y-intercept, and t-intercept, and describe the practical meaning of each.
The graph of y versus t is a straight line because you are traveling at constant speed.
The line passes through the two points (1, 110) and (1.5, 85), so its slope is m = (85 −

1.1

Lines

17

110)/(1.5 − 1) = −50. The meaning of the slope is that you are traveling at 50 mph; m is
negative because you are traveling toward Seattle, i.e., your distance y is decreasing. The
word “velocity” is often used for m = −50, when we want to indicate direction, while the
word “speed” refers to the magnitude (absolute value) of velocity, which is 50 mph. To
find the equation of the line, we use the point-slope formula:
y − 110
= −50,
t−1

so that

y = −50(t − 1) + 110 = −50t + 160.

The meaning of the y-intercept 160 is that when t = 0 (when you started the trip) you were
160 miles from Seattle. To find the t-intercept, set 0 = −50t+160, so that t = 160/50 = 3.2.
The meaning of the t-intercept is the duration of your trip, from the start until you arrive
in Seattle. After traveling 3 hours and 12 minutes, your distance y from Seattle will be 0.

Distance Between Two Points; Circles

Given two points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ), recall that their horizontal distance from one another
is ∆x = x2 −x1 and their vertical distance from one another is ∆y = y2 −y1 . (Actually, the
word “distance” normally denotes “positive distance”. ∆x and ∆y are signed distances,
but this is clear from context.) The actual (positive) distance from one point to the other
is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs |∆x| and |∆y|, as shown in
figure 1.2.1. The Pythagorean theorem then says that the distance between the two points
is the square root of the sum of the squares of the horizontal and vertical sides:
distance =

√

(∆x)2 + (∆y)2 =

√

(x2 − x1 )2 + (y2 − y1 )2 .

For example, the distance between points A(2, 1) and B(3, 3) is

(x1 , y1 )

Distance between two points, ∆x and ∆y positive.

As a special case of the distance formula, suppose we want to know the distance of a
√
point (x, y) to the origin. According to the distance formula, this is (x − 0)2 + (y − 0)2 =
√
x2 + y 2 .
√
A point (x, y) is at a distance r from the origin if and only if x2 + y 2 = r, or, if we
square both sides: x2 + y 2 = r2 . This is the equation of the circle of radius r centered at
the origin. The special case r = 1 is called the unit circle; its equation is x2 + y 2 = 1.
Similarly, if C(h, k) is any fixed point, then a point (x, y) is at a distance r from the
√
point C if and only if (x − h)2 + (y − k)2 = r, i.e., if and only if
(x − h)2 + (y − k)2 = r2 .
This is the equation of the circle of radius r centered at the point (h, k). For example, the
circle of radius 5 centered at the point (0, −6) has equation (x − 0)2 + (y − −6)2 = 25, or
x2 +(y +6)2 = 25. If we expand this we get x2 +y 2 +12y +36 = 25 or x2 +y 2 +12y +11 = 0,
but the original form is usually more useful.

EXAMPLE 1.2.1 Graph the circle x2 − 2x + y 2 + 4y − 11 = 0. With a little thought
we convert this to (x − 1)2 + (y + 2)2 − 16 = 0 or (x − 1)2 + (y + 2)2 = 16. Now we see
that this is the circle with radius 4 and center (1, −2), which is easy to graph.

1.3

Functions

A function y = f (x) is a rule for determining y when we’re given a value of x. For
example, the rule y = f (x) = 2x + 1 is a function. Any line y = mx + b is called a
linearfunction. The graph of a function looks like a curve above (or below) the x-axis,
where for any value of x the rule y = f (x) tells us how far to go above (or below) the
x-axis to reach the curve.
Functions can be defined in various ways: by an algebraic formula or several algebraic
formulas, by a graph, or by an experimentally determined table of values. (In the latter
case, the table gives a bunch of points in the plane, which we might then interpolate with
a smooth curve, if that makes sense.)
Given a value of x, a function must give at most one value of y. Thus, vertical lines
are not functions. For example, the line x = 1 has infinitely many values of y if x = 1. It

1.3

Functions

21

is also true that if x is any number not 1 there is no y which corresponds to x, but that is
not a problem—only multiple y values is a problem.
In addition to lines, another familiar example of a function is the parabola y = f (x) =
2
x . We can draw the graph of this function by taking various values of x (say, at regular
intervals) and plotting the points (x, f (x)) = (x, x2 ). Then connect the points with a
smooth curve. (See figure 1.3.1.)
The two examples y = f (x) = 2x + 1 and y = f (x) = x2 are both functions which
can be evaluated at any value of x from negative infinity to positive infinity. For many
functions, however, it only makes sense to take x in some interval or outside of some
“forbidden” region. The interval of x-values at which we’re allowed to evaluate the function
is called the domain of the function.

y = f (x) = 1/x

Some graphs.

√
For example, the square-root function y = f (x) = x is the rule which says, given an
x-value, take the nonnegative number whose square is x. This rule only makes sense if x
is positive or zero. We say that the domain of this function is x ≥ 0, or more formally
{x ∈ R | x ≥ 0}. Alternately, we can use interval notation, and write that the domain is
[0, ∞). (In interval notation, square brackets mean that the endpoint is included, and a
√
parenthesis means that the endpoint is not included.) The fact that the domain of y = x
is [0, ∞) means that in the graph of this function ((see figure 1.3.1) we have points (x, y)
only above x-values on the right side of the x-axis.
Another example of a function whose domain is not the entire x-axis is: y = f (x) =
1/x, the reciprocal function. We cannot substitute x = 0 in this formula. The function
makes sense, however, for any nonzero x, so we take the domain to be: {x ∈ R | x ̸= 0}.
The graph of this function does not have any point (x, y) with x = 0. As x gets close to
0 from either side, the graph goes oﬀ toward infinity. We call the vertical line x = 0 an
asymptote.
To summarize, two reasons why certain x-values are excluded from the domain of a
function are that (i) we cannot divide by zero, and (ii) we cannot take the square root

22 Chapter 1 Analytic Geometry
of a negative number. We will encounter some other ways in which functions might be
undefined later.
Another reason why the domain of a function might be restricted is that in a given
situation the x-values outside of some range might have no practical meaning. For example,
if y is the area of a square of side x, then we can write y = f (x) = x2 . In a purely
mathematical context the domain of the function y = x2 is all of R. But in the storyproblem context of finding areas of squares, we restrict the domain to positive values of x,
because a square with negative or zero side makes no sense.
In a problem in pure mathematics, we usually take the domain to be all values of x
at which the formulas can be evaluated. But in a story problem there might be further
restrictions on the domain because only certain values of x are of interest or make practical
sense.
In a story problem, often letters diﬀerent from x and y are used. For example, the
volume V of a sphere is a function of the radius r, given by the formula V = f (r) = 4/3πr3 .
Also, letters diﬀerent from f may be used. For example, if y is the velocity of something
at time t, we may write y = v(t) with the letter v (instead of f ) standing for the velocity
function (and t playing the role of x).
The letter playing the role of x is called the independent variable, and the letter
playing the role of y is called the dependent variable (because its value “depends on”
the value of the independent variable). In story problems, when one has to translate from
English into mathematics, a crucial step is to determine what letters stand for variables.
If only words and no letters are given, then we have to decide which letters to use. Some
letters are traditional. For example, almost always, t stands for time.
EXAMPLE 1.3.1 An open-top box is made from an a×b rectangular piece of cardboard
by cutting out a square of side x from each of the four corners, and then folding the sides
up and sealing them with duct tape. Find a formula for the volume V of the box as a
function of x, and find the domain of this function.
The box we get will have height x and rectangular base of dimensions a − 2x by b − 2x.
Thus,
V = f (x) = x(a − 2x)(b − 2x).
Here a and b are constants, and V is the variable that depends on x, i.e., V is playing the
role of y.
This formula makes mathematical sense for any x, but in the story problem the domain
is much less. In the first place, x must be positive. In the second place, it must be less
than half the length of either of the sides of the cardboard. Thus, the domain is
{x ∈ R | 0 < x <

1
(minimum of a and b)}.

Functions

23

In interval notation we write: the domain is the interval (0, min(a, b)/2). (You might think
about whether we could allow 0 or min(a, b)/2 to be in the domain. They make a certain
physical sense, though we normally would not call the result a box. If we were to allow
these values, what would the corresponding volumes be? Does that make sense?)
EXAMPLE 1.3.2 Circle of radius r centered at the origin
The equation for
2
2
2
this circle is usually given in the form x + y = r . To write the equation in the form
√
y = f (x) we solve for y, obtaining y = ± r2 − x2 . But this is not a function, because
when we substitute a value in (−r, r) for x there are two corresponding values of y. To get
a function, we must choose one of the two signs in front of the square root. If we choose
√
the positive sign, for example, we get the upper semicircle y = f (x) = r2 − x2 (see
figure 1.3.2). The domain of this function is the interval [−r, r], i.e., x must be between −r
and r (including the endpoints). If x is outside of that interval, then r2 − x2 is negative,
and we cannot take the square root. In terms of the graph, this just means that there are
no points on the curve whose x-coordinate is greater than r or less than −r.

4x − x2

To answer this question, we must rule out the x-values that make 4x−x2 negative (because
we cannot take the square root of a negative number) and also the x-values that make
4x − x2 zero (because if 4x − x2 = 0, then when we take the square root we get 0, and
we cannot divide by 0). In other words, the domain consists of all x for which 4x − x2 is
strictly positive. We give two diﬀerent methods to find out when 4x − x2 > 0.
First method. Factor 4x − x2 as x(4 − x). The product of two numbers is positive
when either both are positive or both are negative, i.e., if either x > 0 and 4 − x > 0,

or else x < 0 and 4 − x < 0. The latter alternative is impossible, since if x is negative,
then 4 − x is greater than 4, and so cannot be negative. As for the first alternative, the
condition 4 − x > 0 can be rewritten (adding x to both sides) as 4 > x, so we need: x > 0
and 4 > x (this is sometimes combined in the form 4 > x > 0, or, equivalently, 0 < x < 4).
In interval notation, this says that the domain is the interval (0, 4).
Second method. Write 4x − x2 as −(x2 − 4x), and then complete the square,
(
)
obtaining − (x − 2)2 − 4 = 4 − (x − 2)2 . For this to be positive we need (x − 2)2 < 4,
which means that x − 2 must be less than 2 and greater than −2: −2 < x − 2 < 2. Adding
2 to everything gives 0 < x < 4. Both of these methods are equally correct; you may use
either in a problem of this type.
A function does not always have to be given by a single formula, as we have already
seen (in the income tax problem, for example). Suppose that y = v(t) is the velocity
function for a car which starts out from rest (zero velocity) at time t = 0; then increases
its speed steadily to 20 m/sec, taking 10 seconds to do this; then travels at constant speed
20 m/sec for 15 seconds; and finally applies the brakes to decrease speed steadily to 0,
taking 5 seconds to do this. The formula for y = v(t) is diﬀerent in each of the three time
intervals: first y = 2x, then y = 20, then y = −4x + 120. The graph of this function is
shown in figure 1.3.3.

A velocity function.

Not all functions are given by formulas at all. A function can be given by an experimentally determined table of values, or by a description other than a formula. For
example, the population y of the U.S. is a function of the time t: we can write y = f (t).
This is a perfectly good function—we could graph it (up to the present) if we had data for
various t—but we can’t find an algebraic formula for it.

1.4

Shifts and Dilations

Many functions in applications are built up from simple functions by inserting constants
in various places. It is important to understand the eﬀect such constants have on the
appearance of the graph.
Horizontal shifts. If we replace x by x − C everywhere it occurs in the formula for f (x),
then the graph shifts over C to the right. (If C is negative, then this means that the graph
shifts over |C| to the left.) For example, the graph of y = (x−2)2 is the x2 -parabola shifted
over to have its vertex at the point 2 on the x-axis. The graph of y = (x + 1)2 is the same

26 Chapter 1 Analytic Geometry
parabola shifted over to the left so as to have its vertex at −1 on the x-axis. Note well:
when replacing x by x − C we must pay attention to meaning, not merely appearance.
Starting with y = x2 and literally replacing x by x − 2 gives y = x − 22 . This is y = x − 4,
a line with slope 1, not a shifted parabola.
Vertical shifts. If we replace y by y − D, then the graph moves up D units. (If D is
negative, then this means that the graph moves down |D| units.) If the formula is written
in the form y = f (x) and if y is replaced by y − D to get y − D = f (x), we can equivalently
move D to the other side of the equation and write y = f (x) + D. Thus, this principle
can be stated: to get the graph of y = f (x) + D, take the graph of y = f (x) and move it
D units up. For example, the function y = x2 − 4x = (x − 2)2 − 4 can be obtained from
y = (x − 2)2 (see the last paragraph) by moving the graph 4 units down. The result is the
x2 -parabola shifted 2 units to the right and 4 units down so as to have its vertex at the
point (2, −4).
Warning. Do not confuse f (x) + D and f (x + D). For example, if f (x) is the function x2 ,
then f (x) + 2 is the function x2 + 2, while f (x + 2) is the function (x + 2)2 = x2 + 4x + 4.
EXAMPLE 1.4.1 Circles
An important example of the above two principles starts
2
2
2
with the circle x + y = r . This is the circle of radius r centered at the origin. (As we
√
saw, this is not a single function y = f (x), but rather two functions y = ± r2 − x2 put
together; in any case, the two shifting principles apply to equations like this one that are
not in the form y = f (x).) If we replace x by x − C and replace y by y − D—getting the
equation (x − C)2 + (y − D)2 = r2 —the eﬀect on the circle is to move it C to the right
and D up, thereby obtaining the circle of radius r centered at the point (C, D). This tells
us how to write the equation of any circle, not necessarily centered at the origin.
We will later want to use two more principles concerning the eﬀects of constants on
the appearance of the graph of a function.
Horizontal dilation. If x is replaced by x/A in a formula and A > 1, then the eﬀect on
the graph is to expand it by a factor of A in the x-direction (away from the y-axis). If A
is between 0 and 1 then the eﬀect on the graph is to contract by a factor of 1/A (towards
the y-axis). We use the word “dilate” to mean expand or contract.
For example, replacing x by x/0.5 = x/(1/2) = 2x has the eﬀect of contracting toward
the y-axis by a factor of 2. If A is negative, we dilate by a factor of |A| and then flip
about the y-axis. Thus, replacing x by −x has the eﬀect of taking the mirror image of the
√
graph with respect to the y-axis. For example, the function y = −x, which has domain
√
{x ∈ R | x ≤ 0}, is obtained by taking the graph of x and flipping it around the y-axis
into the second quadrant.

1.4

Shifts and Dilations

27

Vertical dilation. If y is replaced by y/B in a formula and B > 0, then the eﬀect on
the graph is to dilate it by a factor of B in the vertical direction. As before, this is an
expansion or contraction depending on whether B is larger or smaller than one. Note that
if we have a function y = f (x), replacing y by y/B is equivalent to multiplying the function
on the right by B: y = Bf (x). The eﬀect on the graph is to expand the picture away from
the x-axis by a factor of B if B > 1, to contract it toward the x-axis by a factor of 1/B if
0 < B < 1, and to dilate by |B| and then flip about the x-axis if B is negative.
EXAMPLE 1.4.2 Ellipses A basic example of the two expansion principles is given
by an ellipse of semimajor axis a and semiminor axis b. We get such an ellipse by
starting with the unit circle—the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, the equation
of which is x2 + y 2 = 1—and dilating by a factor of a horizontally and by a factor of b
vertically. To get the equation of the resulting ellipse, which crosses the x-axis at ±a and
crosses the y-axis at ±b, we replace x by x/a and y by y/b in the equation for the unit
circle. This gives

Finally, if we want to analyze a function that involves both shifts and dilations, it
is usually simplest to work with the dilations first, and then the shifts. For instance, if
we want to dilate a function by a factor of A in the x-direction and then shift C to the
right, we do this by replacing x first by x/A and then by (x − C) in the formula. As an
example, suppose that, after dilating our unit circle by a in the x-direction and by b in the
y-direction to get the ellipse in the last paragraph, we then wanted to shift it a distance
h to the right and a distance k upward, so as to be centered at the point (h, k). The new
ellipse would have equation

Instantaneous Rate of Change:
The Derivative

2.1

The slope of a function

Suppose that y is a function of x, say y = f (x). It is often necessary to know how sensitive
the value of y is to small changes in x.
√
EXAMPLE 2.1.1 Take, for example, y = f (x) = 625 − x2 (the upper semicircle of
√
radius 25 centered at the origin). When x = 7, we find that y = 625 − 49 = 24. Suppose
we want to know how much y changes when x increases a little, say to 7.1 or 7.01.
In the case of a straight line y = mx+b, the slope m = ∆y/∆x measures the change in
y per unit change in x. This can be interpreted as a measure of “sensitivity”; for example,
if y = 100x + 5, a small change in x corresponds to a change one hundred times as large
in y, so y is quite sensitive to changes in x.
√
Let us look at the same ratio ∆y/∆x for our function y = f (x) = 625 − x2 when x
changes from 7 to 7.1. Here ∆x = 7.1 − 7 = 0.1 is the change in x, and
∆y = f (x + ∆x) − f (x) = f (7.1) − f (7)
√
√
= 625 − 7.12 − 625 − 72 ≈ 23.9706 − 24 = −0.0294.
Thus, ∆y/∆x ≈ −0.0294/0.1 = −0.294. This means that y changes by less than one
third the change in x, so apparently y is not very sensitive to changes in x at x = 7.
We say “apparently” here because we don’t really know what happens between 7 and 7.1.
Perhaps y changes dramatically as x runs through the values from 7 to 7.1, but at 7.1 y
just happens to be close to its value at 7. This is not in fact the case for this particular
function, but we don’t yet know why.
29

30 Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative
One way to interpret the above calculation is by reference to a line. We have computed
the slope of the line through (7, 24) and (7.1, 23.9706), called a chord of the circle. In
general, if we draw the chord from the point (7, 24) to a nearby point on the semicircle
(7 + ∆x, f (7 + ∆x)), the slope of this chord is the so-called diﬀerence quotient
f (7 + ∆x) − f (7)
slope of chord =
=
∆x

√
625 − (7 + ∆x)2 − 24
.
∆x

For example, if x changes only from 7 to 7.01, then the diﬀerence quotient (slope of the
chord) is approximately equal to (23.997081 − 24)/0.01 = −0.2919. This is slightly less
steep than the chord from (7, 24) to (7.1, 23.9706).
As the second value 7 + ∆x moves in towards 7, the chord joining (7, f (7)) to (7 +
∆x, f (7 + ∆x)) shifts slightly. As indicated in figure 2.1.1, as ∆x gets smaller and smaller,
the chord joining (7, 24) to (7 + ∆x, f (7 + ∆x)) gets closer and closer to the tangent line
to the circle at the point (7, 24). (Recall that the tangent line is the line that just grazes
the circle at that point, i.e., it doesn’t meet the circle at any second point.) Thus, as ∆x
gets smaller and smaller, the slope ∆y/∆x of the chord gets closer and closer to the slope
of the tangent line. This is actually quite diﬃcult to see when ∆x is small, because of the
scale of the graph. The values of ∆x used for the figure are 1, 5, 10 and 15, not really very
small values. The tangent line is the one that is uppermost at the right hand endpoint.

Chords approximating the tangent line. (AP)

So far we have found the slopes of two chords that should be close to the slope of
the tangent line, but what is the slope of the tangent line exactly? Since the tangent line
touches the circle at just one point, we will never be able to calculate its slope directly,
using two “known” points on the line. What we need is a way to capture what happens
to the slopes of the chords as they get “closer and closer” to the tangent line.

2.1

The slope of a function

31

Instead of looking at more particular values of ∆x, let’s see what happens if we do
some algebra with the diﬀerence quotient using just ∆x. The slope of a chord from (7, 24)
to a nearby point is given by
√

√
∆x( 625 − (7 + ∆x)2 + 24)

=√

−14 − ∆x
625 − (7 + ∆x)2 + 24

Now, can we tell by looking at this last formula what happens when ∆x gets very close to
zero? The numerator clearly gets very close to −14 while the denominator gets very close to
√
625 − 72 + 24 = 48. Is the fraction therefore very close to −14/48 = −7/24 ∼
= −0.29167?
It certainly seems reasonable, and in fact it is true: as ∆x gets closer and closer to zero,
the diﬀerence quotient does in fact get closer and closer to −7/24, and so the slope of the
tangent line is exactly −7/24.
What about the slope of the tangent line at x = 12? Well, 12 can’t be all that diﬀerent
from 7; we just have to redo the calculation with 12 instead of 7. This won’t be hard, but
it will be a bit tedious. What if we try to do all the algebra without using a specific value
for x? Let’s copy from above, replacing 7 by x. We’ll have to do a bit more than that—for

32 Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative

Replacing x by 7 gives −7/24, as before, and now we can easily do the computation for 12
or any other value of x between −25 and 25.
√
So now we have a single, simple formula, −x/ 625 − x2 , that tells us the slope of the
tangent line for any value of x. This slope, in turn, tells us how sensitive the value of y is
to changes in the value of x.
What do we call such a formula? That is, a formula with one variable, so that substituting an “input” value for the variable produces a new “output” value? This is a function.
√
Starting with one function, 625 − x2 , we have derived, by means of some slightly nasty
√
algebra, a new function, −x/ 625 − x2 , that gives us important information about the
original function. This new function in fact is called the derivative of the original function. If the original is referred to as f or y then the derivative is often written f ′ or y ′ and

pronounced “f prime” or “y prime”, so in this case we might write f ′ (x) = −x/ 625 − x2 .
At a particular point, say x = 7, we say that f ′ (7) = −7/24 or “f prime of 7 is −7/24” or
“the derivative of f at 7 is −7/24.”
To summarize, we compute the derivative of f (x) by forming the diﬀerence quotient
f (x + ∆x) − f (x)
,
(2.1.1)
∆x
which is the slope of a line, then we figure out what happens when ∆x gets very close to
0.

The slope of a function

33

We should note that in the particular case of a circle, there’s a simple way to find the
derivative. Since the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius drawn
to the point of contact, its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the radius. The
radius joining (0, 0) to (7, 24) has slope 24/7. Hence, the tangent line has slope −7/24. In
√
√
general, a radius to the point (x, 625 − x2 ) has slope 625 − x2 /x, so the slope of the
√
tangent line is −x/ 625 − x2 , as before. It is NOT always true that a tangent line is
perpendicular to a line from the origin—don’t use this shortcut in any other circumstance.
As above, and as you might expect, for diﬀerent values of x we generally get diﬀerent
values of the derivative f ′ (x). Could it be that the derivative always has the same value?
This would mean that the slope of f , or the slope of its tangent line, is the same everywhere.
One curve that always has the same slope is a line; it seems odd to talk about the tangent
line to a line, but if it makes sense at all the tangent line must be the line itself. It is not
hard to see that the derivative of f (x) = mx + b is f ′ (x) = m; see exercise 6.

An example

We started the last section by saying, “It is often necessary to know how sensitive the
value of y is to small changes in x.” We have seen one purely mathematical example of
this: finding the “steepness” of a curve at a point is precisely this problem. Here is a more
applied example.
With careful measurement it might be possible to discover that a dropped ball has
height h(t) = h0 −kt2 , t seconds after it is released. (Here h0 is the initial height of the ball,
when t = 0, and k is some number determined by the experiment.) A natural question is
then, “How fast is the ball going at time t?” We can certainly get a pretty good idea with a
little simple arithmetic. To make the calculation more concrete, let’s say h0 = 100 meters
and k = 4.9 and suppose we’re interested in the speed at t = 2. We know that when t = 2
the height is 100 − 4 · 4.9 = 80.4. A second later, at t = 3, the height is 100 − 9 · 4.9 = 55.9,
so in that second the ball has traveled 80.4 − 55.9 = 24.5 meters. This means that the
average speed during that time was 24.5 meters per second. So we might guess that 24.5
meters per second is not a terrible estimate of the speed at t = 2. But certainly we can
do better. At t = 2.5 the height is 100 − 4.9(2.5)2 = 69.375. During the half second from
t = 2 to t = 2.5 the ball dropped 80.4 − 69.375 = 11.025 meters, at an average speed of
11.025/(1/2) = 22.05 meters per second; this should be a better estimate of the speed at
t = 2. So it’s clear now how to get better and better approximations: compute average
speeds over shorter and shorter time intervals. Between t = 2 and t = 2.01, for example,
the ball drops 0.19649 meters in one hundredth of a second, at an average speed of 19.649
meters per second.
We can’t do this forever, and we still might reasonably ask what the actual speed
precisely at t = 2 is. If ∆t is some tiny amount of time, what we want to know is what
happens to the average speed (h(2) − h(2 + ∆t))/∆t as ∆t gets smaller and smaller. Doing

2.2

An example

a bit of algebra:
h(2) − h(2 + ∆t)
80.4 − (100 − 4.9(2 + ∆t)2 )
=

=
∆t
2
19.6∆t + 4.9∆t
=
∆t
= 19.6 + 4.9∆t
When ∆t is very small, this is very close to 19.6, and indeed it seems clear that as ∆t
goes to zero, the average speed goes to 19.6, so the exact speed at t = 2 is 19.6 meters per
second. This calculation should look very familiar. In the language of the previous section,
we might have started with f (x) = 100 − 4.9x2 and asked for the slope of the tangent line
at x = 2. We would have answered that question by computing
f (2 + ∆x) − f (2)
−19.6∆x − 4.9∆x2
=
= −19.6 − 4.9∆x
∆x
∆x
The algebra is the same, except that following the pattern of the previous section the
subtraction would be reversed, and we would say that the slope of the tangent line is
−19.6. Indeed, in hindsight, perhaps we should have subtracted the other way even for
the dropping ball. At t = 2 the height is 80.4; one second later the height is 55.9. The
usual way to compute a “distance traveled” is to subtract the earlier position from the
later one, or 55.9 − 80.4 = −24.5. This tells us that the distance traveled is 24.5 meters,
and the negative sign tells us that the height went down during the second. If we continue
the original calculation we then get −19.6 meters per second as the exact speed at t = 2.
If we interpret the negative sign as meaning that the motion is downward, which seems
reasonable, then in fact this is the same answer as before, but with even more information,
since the numerical answer contains the direction of motion as well as the speed. Thus,
the speed of the ball is the value of the derivative of a certain function, namely, of the
function that gives the position of the ball. (More properly, this is the velocity of the ball;
velocity is signed speed, that is, speed with a direction indicated by the sign.)
The upshot is that this problem, finding the speed of the ball, is exactly the same
problem mathematically as finding the slope of a curve. This may already be enough
evidence to convince you that whenever some quantity is changing (the height of a curve
or the height of a ball or the size of the economy or the distance of a space probe from
earth or the population of the world) the rate at which the quantity is changing can, in
principle, be computed in exactly the same way, by finding a derivative.

would you guess? ⇒
2. Let y = f (t) = t2 , where t is the time in seconds and y is the distance in meters that an
object falls on a certain airless planet. Draw a graph of this function between t = 0 and

(b) 2 sec and 2.1 sec, (c) 2 sec and 2.01 sec, (d) 2 sec and 2.001 sec. Then use algebra to find
a simple formula for the average speed between time 2 and time 2 + ∆t. (If you substitute
∆t = 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 in this formula you should again get the answers to parts (a)–(d).)
Next, in your formula for average speed (which should be in simplified form) determine what
happens as ∆t approaches zero. This is the instantaneous speed. Finally, in your graph
of y = t2 draw the straight line through the point (2, 4) whose slope is the instantaneous
velocity you just computed; it should of course be the tangent line. ⇒
3. If an object is dropped from an 80-meter high window, its height y above the ground at time
t seconds is given by the formula y = f (t) = 80−4.9t2 . (Here we are neglecting air resistance;

object between (a) 1 sec and 1.1 sec, (b) 1 sec and 1.01 sec, (c) 1 sec and 1.001 sec. Now use
algebra to find a simple formula for the average velocity of the falling object between 1 sec
and 1 + ∆t sec. Determine what happens to this average velocity as ∆t approaches 0. That
is the instantaneous velocity at time t = 1 second (it will be negative, because the object is
falling). ⇒

2.3

Limits

In the previous two sections we computed some quantities of interest (slope, velocity) by
seeing that some expression “goes to” or “approaches” or “gets really close to” a particular
value. In the examples we saw, this idea may have been clear enough, but it is too fuzzy
to rely on in more diﬃcult circumstances. In this section we will see how to make the idea
more precise.
There is an important feature of the examples we have seen. Consider again the
formula
−19.6∆x − 4.9∆x2
.
∆x
We wanted to know what happens to this fraction as “∆x goes to zero.” Because we were
able to simplify the fraction, it was easy to see the answer, but it was not quite as simple

2.3

as “substituting zero for ∆x,” as that would give
−19.6 · 0 − 4.9 · 0
,
0
which is meaningless. The quantity we are really interested in does not make sense “at
zero,” and this is why the answer to the original problem (finding a velocity or a slope)
was not immediately obvious. In other words, we are generally going to want to figure
out what a quantity “approaches” in situations where we can’t merely plug in a value. If
you would like to think about a hard example (which we will analyze later) consider what
happens to (sin x)/x as x approaches zero.
√
EXAMPLE 2.3.1 Does x approach 1.41 as x approaches 2? In this case it is possible
√
to compute the actual value 2 to a high precision to answer the question. But since
√
in general we won’t be able to do that, let’s not. We might start by computing x for
√
values of x close to 2, as we did in the previous sections. Here are some values: 2.05 =
√
√
√
√
1.431782106, 2.04 = 1.428285686, 2.03 = 1.424780685, 2.02 = 1.421267040, 2.01 =
√
√
√
1.417744688, 2.005 = 1.415980226, 2.004 = 1.415627070, 2.003 = 1.415273825,
√
√
2.002 = 1.414920492, 2.001 = 1.414567072. So it looks at least possible that indeed
√
these values “approach” 1.41—already 2.001 is quite close. If we continue this process,
√
however, at some point we will appear to “stall.” In fact, 2 = 1.414213562 . . ., so we will
never even get as far as 1.4142, no matter how long we continue the sequence.
√
So in a fuzzy, everyday sort of sense, it is true that x “gets close to” 1.41, but it
does not “approach” 1.41 in the sense we want. To compute an exact slope or an exact
velocity, what we want to know is that a given quantity becomes “arbitrarily close” to a
fixed value, meaning that the first quantity can be made “as close as we like” to the fixed
value. Consider again the quantities
−19.6∆x − 4.9∆x2
= −19.6 − 4.9∆x.
∆x
These two quantities are equal as long as ∆x is not zero; if ∆x is zero, the left hand
quantity is meaningless, while the right hand one is −19.6. Can we say more than we
did before about why the right hand side “approaches” −19.6, in the desired sense? Can
we really make it “as close as we want” to −19.6? Let’s try a test case. Can we make
−19.6 − 4.9∆x within one millionth (0.000001) of −19.6? The values within a millionth of
−19.6 are those in the interval (−19.600001, −19.599999). As ∆x approaches zero, does
−19.6 − 4.9∆x eventually reside inside this interval? If ∆x is positive, this would require
that −19.6 − 4.9∆x > −19.600001. This is something we can manipulate with a little

38 Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative
algebra:
−19.6 − 4.9∆x > −19.600001
−4.9∆x > −0.000001
∆x < −0.000001/ − 4.9
∆x < 0.0000002040816327 . . .
Thus, we can say with certainty that if ∆x is positive and less than 0.0000002, then
∆x < 0.0000002040816327 . . . and so −19.6 − 4.9∆x > −19.600001. We could do a similar
calculation if ∆x is negative.
So now we know that we can make −19.6 − 4.9∆x within one millionth of −19.6. But
can we make it “as close as we want”? In this case, it is quite simple to see that the answer
is yes, by modifying the calculation we’ve just done. It may be helpful to think of this as
a game. I claim that I can make −19.6 − 4.9∆x as close as you desire to −19.6 by making
∆x “close enough” to zero. So the game is: you give me a number, like 10−6 , and I have
to come up with a number representing how close ∆x must be to zero to guarantee that
−19.6 − 4.9∆x is at least as close to −19.6 as you have requested.
Now if we actually play this game, I could redo the calculation above for each new
number you provide. What I’d like to do is somehow see that I will always succeed, and
even more, I’d like to have a simple strategy so that I don’t have to do all that algebra
every time. A strategy in this case would be a formula that gives me a correct answer no
matter what you specify. So suppose the number you give me is ϵ. How close does ∆x
have to be to zero to guarantee that −19.6 − 4.9∆x is in (−19.6 − ϵ, −19.6 + ϵ)? If ∆x is
positive, we need:
−19.6 − 4.9∆x > −19.6 − ϵ
−4.9∆x > −ϵ
∆x < −ϵ/ − 4.9
∆x < ϵ/4.9
So if I pick any number δ that is less than ϵ/4.9, the algebra tells me that whenever ∆x < δ
then ∆x < ϵ/4.9 and so −19.6 − 4.9∆x is within ϵ of −19.6. (This is exactly what I did
in the example: I picked δ = 0.0000002 < 0.0000002040816327 . . ..) A similar calculation
again works for negative ∆x. The important fact is that this is now a completely general
result—it shows that I can always win, no matter what “move” you make.
Now we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, “gets closer
and closer” language we have used so far. Henceforward, we will say something like “the
limit of (−19.6∆x−4.9∆x2 )/∆x as ∆x goes to zero is −19.6,” and abbreviate this mouthful

∆x→0

lim

Here is the actual, oﬃcial definition of “limit”.
DEFINITION 2.3.2

Limit

Suppose f is a function. We say that lim f (x) = L if
x→a

for every ϵ > 0 there is a δ > 0 so that whenever 0 < |x − a| < δ, |f (x) − L| < ϵ.
The ϵ and δ here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The
definition says, in a very precise way, that f (x) can be made as close as desired to L
(that’s the |f (x) − L| < ϵ part) by making x close enough to a (the 0 < |x − a| < δ
part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if x = a, that is,
if |x − a| = 0. This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting a for x
doesn’t even make sense.
Make sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic
definition talks about f (x), but the function and the variable might have other names. In
the discussion above, the function we analyzed was
−19.6∆x − 4.9∆x2
.
∆x
and the variable of the limit was not x but ∆x. The x was the variable of the original
function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, x was essentially a fixed
quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was
literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity a of the definition
in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as ∆x became
very close to zero.
Armed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a
particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious
and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most
expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.
EXAMPLE 2.3.3

Let’s show carefully that lim x + 4 = 6. This is not something we
x→2

“need” to prove, since it is “obviously” true. But if we couldn’t prove it using our oﬃcial
definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.
As is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to
end up showing that under certain circumstances x + 4 is close to 6; precisely, we want to
show that |x + 4 − 6| < ϵ, or |x − 2| < ϵ. Under what circumstances? We want this to be
true whenever 0 < |x − 2| < δ. So the question becomes: can we choose a value for δ that

40 Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative
guarantees that 0 < |x − 2| < δ implies |x − 2| < ϵ? Of course: no matter what ϵ is, δ = ϵ
works.
So it turns out to be very easy to prove something “obvious,” which is nice. It doesn’t
take long before things get trickier, however.
EXAMPLE 2.3.4

It seems clear that lim x2 = 4. Let’s try to prove it. We will want
x→2

to be able to show that |x − 4| < ϵ whenever 0 < |x − 2| < δ, by choosing δ carefully. Is
there any connection between |x − 2| and |x2 − 4|? Yes, and it’s not hard to spot, but it is
not so simple as the previous example. We can write |x2 − 4| = |(x + 2)(x − 2)|. Now when
|x − 2| is small, part of |(x + 2)(x − 2)| is small, namely (x − 2). What about (x + 2)? If x is
close to 2, (x + 2) certainly can’t be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it.
Let’s recall the “game” version of what is going on here. You get to pick an ϵ and I have to
pick a δ that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of ϵ I need to
worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently “bad” move like
ϵ = 1000. I expect that ϵ is going to be small, and that the corresponding δ will be small,
certainly less than 1. If δ ≤ 1 then |x + 2| < 5 when |x − 2| < δ (because if x is within 1 of
2, then x is between 1 and 3 and x + 2 is between 3 and 5). So then I’d be trying to show
that |(x + 2)(x − 2)| < 5|x − 2| < ϵ. So now how can I pick δ so that |x − 2| < δ implies
5|x − 2| < ϵ? This is easy: use δ = ϵ/5, so 5|x − 2| < 5(ϵ/5) = ϵ. But what if the ϵ you
choose is not small? If you choose ϵ = 1000, should I pick δ = 200? No, to keep things
“sane” I will never pick a δ bigger than 1. Here’s the final “game strategy:” When you
pick a value for ϵ I will pick δ = ϵ/5 or δ = 1, whichever is smaller. Now when |x − 2| < δ,
I know both that |x + 2| < 5 and that |x − 2| < ϵ/5. Thus |(x + 2)(x − 2)| < 5(ϵ/5) = ϵ.
This has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If
this were written down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:
Proof that lim x2 = 4. Given any ϵ, pick δ = ϵ/5 or δ = 1, whichever is smaller. Then
2

x→2

when |x − 2| < δ, |x + 2| < 5 and |x − 2| < ϵ/5. Hence |x2 − 4| = |(x + 2)(x − 2)| < 5(ϵ/5) =
ϵ.
It probably seems obvious that lim x2 = 4, and it is worth examining more closely
x→2

why it seems obvious. If we write x = x · x, and ask what happens when x approaches 2,
we might say something like, “Well, the first x approaches 2, and the second x approaches
2, so the product must approach 2 · 2.” In fact this is pretty much right on the money,
except for that word “must.” Is it really true that if x approaches a and y approaches b
then xy approaches ab? It is, but it is not really obvious, since x and y might be quite
complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then
2

2.3

Limits

41

we don’t have to worry about it ever again. When we say that x might be “complicated”
we really mean that in practice it might be a function. Here is then what we want to know:
THEOREM 2.3.5

Suppose lim f (x) = L and lim g(x) = M . Then
x→a

x→a

limx→a f (x)g(x) = LM .
Proof. We have to use the oﬃcial definition of limit to make sense of this. So given any
ϵ we need to find a δ so that 0 < |x − a| < δ implies |f (x)g(x) − LM | < ϵ. What do we
have to work with? We know that we can make f (x) close to L and g(x) close to M , and
we have to somehow connect these facts to make f (x)g(x) close to LM .
We use, as is so often the case, a little algebraic trick:
|f (x)g(x) − LM | = |f (x)g(x) − f (x)M + f (x)M − LM |
= |f (x)(g(x) − M ) + (f (x) − L)M |
≤ |f (x)(g(x) − M )| + |(f (x) − L)M |
= |f (x)||g(x) − M | + |f (x) − L||M |.
This is all straightforward except perhaps for the “≤”. That is an example of the triangle
inequality , which says that if a and b are any real numbers then |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|. If
you look at a few examples, using positive and negative numbers in various combinations
for a and b, you should quickly understand why this is true; we will not prove it formally.
Since lim f (x) = L, there is a value δ1 so that 0 < |x − a| < δ1 implies |f (x) − L| <

|ϵ/(2M )|, This means that 0 < |x − a| < δ1 implies |f (x) − L||M | < ϵ/2. You can see
where this is going: if we can make |f (x)||g(x) − M | < ϵ/2 also, then we’ll be done.
We can make |g(x) − M | smaller than any fixed number by making x close enough
to a; unfortunately, ϵ/(2f (x)) is not a fixed number, since x is a variable. Here we need
another little trick, just like the one we used in analyzing x2 . We can find a δ2 so that
|x − a| < δ2 implies that |f (x) − L| < 1, meaning that L − 1 < f (x) < L + 1. This means
that |f (x)| < N , where N is either |L − 1| or |L + 1|, depending on whether L is negative
or positive. The important point is that N doesn’t depend on x. Finally, we know that
there is a δ3 so that 0 < |x − a| < δ3 implies |g(x) − M | < ϵ/(2N ). Now we’re ready to
put everything together. Let δ be the smallest of δ1 , δ2 , and δ3 . Then |x − a| < δ implies
that |f (x) − L| < |ϵ/(2M )|, |f (x)| < N , and |g(x) − M | < ϵ/(2N ). Then
|f (x)g(x) − LM | ≤ |f (x)||g(x) − M | + |f (x) − L||M |

This is just what we needed, so by the oﬃcial definition, lim f (x)g(x) = LM .

42 Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative
A handful of such theorems give us the tools to compute many limits without explicitly
working with the definition of limit.
THEOREM 2.3.6

Roughly speaking, these rules say that to compute the limit of an algebraic expression,
it is enough to compute the limits of the “innermost bits” and then combine these limits.
This often means that it is possible to simply plug in a value for the variable, since
lim x = a.

It is worth commenting on the trivial limit lim 5. From one point of view this might
x→1

seem meaningless, as the number 5 can’t “approach” any value, since it is simply a fixed

2.3

Limits

number. But 5 can, and should, be interpreted here as the function that has value 5
everywhere, f (x) = 5, with graph a horizontal line. From this point of view it makes sense
to ask what happens to the height of the function as x approaches 1.
Of course, as we’ve already seen, we’re primarily interested in limits that aren’t so easy,
namely, limits in which a denominator approaches zero. There are a handful of algebraic
tricks that work on many of these limits.
x2 + 2x − 3
. We can’t simply plug in x = 1 because
x→1

that makes the denominator zero. However:

While theorem 2.3.6 is very helpful, we need a bit more to work easily with limits.
Since the theorem applies when some limits are already known, we need to know the
behavior of some functions that cannot themselves be constructed from the simple arith√
metic operations of the theorem, such as x. Also, there is one other extraordinarily
useful way to put functions together: composition. If f (x) and g(x) are functions, we can
√
form two functions by composition: f (g(x)) and g(f (x)). For example, if f (x) = x and
√
√
g(x) = x2 + 5, then f (g(x)) = x2 + 5 and g(f (x)) = ( x)2 + 5 = x + 5. Here is a
companion to theorem 2.3.6 for composition:
THEOREM 2.3.9

Suppose that lim g(x) = L and lim f (x) = f (L). Then
x→a

x→L

lim f (g(x)) = f (L).

x→a

Note the special form of the condition on f : it is not enough to know that lim f (x) =
x→L

M , though it is a bit tricky to see why. Many of the most familiar functions do have this
property, and this theorem can therefore be applied. For example:

EXAMPLE 2.3.11

At the very last step we have used theorems 2.3.9 and 2.3.10.
Occasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider
√
the function f (x) = 1 − x2 , the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about
lim f (x)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as x gets close to 1

x→1

from the left, the value of f (x) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what
happens as x approaches 1 from the right, since f (x) is not defined there. The definition
of the limit, however, demands that f (1 + ∆x) be close to f (1) whether ∆x is positive or
negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even
though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation,
we introduce the concept of one sided limit:
DEFINITION 2.3.12 One-sided limit
Suppose that f (x) is a function. We say
that lim− f (x) = L if for every ϵ > 0 there is a δ > 0 so that whenever 0 < a − x < δ,
x→a

|f (x) − L| < ϵ. We say that limx→a+ f (x) = L if for every ϵ > 0 there is a δ > 0 so that
whenever 0 < x − a < δ, |f (x) − L| < ϵ.
Usually lim− f (x) is read “the limit of f (x) from the left” and lim+ f (x) is read “the

when x < 0, |x| = −x and f (x) = −1. Thus lim−

The Derivative Function

We have seen how to create, or derive, a new function f ′ (x) from a function f (x), summarized in the paragraph containing equation 2.1.1. Now that we have the concept of limits,
we can make this more precise.
DEFINITION 2.4.1

The derivative of a function f , denoted f ′ , is
f (x + ∆x) − f (x)
.
∆x→0
∆x

f ′ (x) = lim

2.4

The Derivative Function

47

We know that f ′ carries important information about the original function f . In one
example we saw that f ′ (x) tells us how steep the graph of f (x) is; in another we saw that
f ′ (x) tells us the velocity of an object if f (x) tells us the position of the object at time x.
As we said earlier, this same mathematical idea is useful whenever f (x) represents some
changing quantity and we want to know something about how it changes, or roughly, the
“rate” at which it changes. Most functions encountered in practice are built up from a
small collection of “primitive” functions in a few simple ways, for example, by adding or
multiplying functions together to get new, more complicated functions. To make good use
of the information provided by f ′ (x) we need to be able to compute it for a variety of such
functions.
We will begin to use diﬀerent notations for the derivative of a function. While initially
confusing, each is often useful so it is worth maintaining multiple versions of the same
thing.
√
Consider again the function f (x) = 625 − x2 . We have computed the derivative
√
f ′ (x) = −x/ 625 − x2 , and have already noted that if we use the alternate notation
√
√
y =
625 − x2 then we might write y ′ = −x/ 625 − x2 . Another notation is quite
diﬀerent, and in time it will become clear why it is often a useful one. Recall that to
compute the the derivative of f we computed
√
lim

∆x→0

625 − (7 + ∆x)2 − 24
.
∆x

The denominator here measures a distance in the x direction, sometimes called the “run”,
and the numerator measures a distance in the y direction, sometimes called the “rise,” and
“rise over run” is the slope of a line. Recall that sometimes such a numerator is abbreviated
∆y, exchanging brevity for a more detailed expression. So in general, a derivative is given
by
∆y
y ′ = lim
.
∆x→0 ∆x
To recall the form of the limit, we sometimes say instead that
∆y
dy
= lim
.
dx ∆x→0 ∆x
In other words, dy/dx is another notation for the derivative, and it reminds us that it is
related to an actual slope between two points. This notation is called Leibniz notation,
after Gottfried Leibniz, who developed the fundamentals of calculus independently, at
about the same time that Isaac Newton did. Again, since we often use f and f (x) to mean
the original function, we sometimes use df /dx and df (x)/dx to refer to the derivative. If

48 Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative
the function f (x) is written out in full we often write the last of these something like this
f ′ (x) =

d √
625 − x2
dx

with the function written to the side, instead of trying to fit it into the numerator.
EXAMPLE 2.4.2

Note. If you happen to know some “derivative formulas” from an earlier course, for
the time being you should pretend that you do not know them. In examples like the
ones above and the exercises below, you are required to know how to find the derivative

formula starting from basic principles. We will later develop some formulas so that we do
not always need to do such computations, but we will continue to need to know how to do
the more involved computations.
Sometimes one encounters a point in the domain of a function y = f (x) where there
is no derivative, because there is no tangent line. In order for the notion of the tangent
line at a point to make sense, the curve must be “smooth” at that point. This means that
if you imagine a particle traveling at some steady speed along the curve, then the particle
does not experience an abrupt change of direction. There are two types of situations you
should be aware of—corners and cusps—where there’s a sudden change of direction and
hence no derivative.
EXAMPLE 2.4.4 Discuss the derivative of the absolute value function y = f (x) = |x|.
If x is positive, then this is the function y = x, whose derivative is the constant 1.
(Recall that when y = f (x) = mx + b, the derivative is the slope m.) If x is negative, then
we’re dealing with the function y = −x, whose derivative is the constant −1. If x = 0,
then the function has a corner, i.e., there is no tangent line. A tangent line would have
to point in the direction of the curve—but there are two directions of the curve that come
together at the origin. We can summarize this as
{
y′ =

1
if x > 0;
−1
if x < 0;
undefined if x = 0.

EXAMPLE 2.4.5
Discuss the derivative of the function y = x2/3 , shown in figure 2.4.1. We will later see
how to compute this derivative; for now we use the fact that y ′ = (2/3)x−1/3 . Visually this
looks much like the absolute value function, but it technically has a cusp, not a corner. The
absolute value function has no tangent line at 0 because there are (at least) two obvious
contenders—the tangent line of the left side of the curve and the tangent line of the right
side. The function y = x2/3 does not have a tangent line at 0, but unlike the absolute value
function it can be said to have a single direction: as we approach 0 from either side the
tangent line becomes closer and closer to a vertical line; the curve is vertical at 0. But as
before, if you imagine traveling along the curve, an abrupt change in direction is required
at 0: a full 180 degree turn.
In practice we won’t worry much about the distinction between these examples; in both
cases the function has a “sharp point” where there is no tangent line and no derivative.

Adjectives For Functions

As we have defined it in Section 1.3, a function is a very general object. At this point, it
is useful to introduce a collection of adjectives to describe certain kinds of functions; these
adjectives name useful properties that functions may have. Consider the graphs of the
functions in Figure 2.5.1. It would clearly be useful to have words to help us describe the
distinct features of each of them. We will point out and define a few adjectives (there are
many more) for the functions pictured here. For the sake of the discussion, we will assume
that the graphs do not exhibit any unusual behavior oﬀ-stage (i.e., outside the view of the
graphs).
Functions. Each graph in Figure 2.5.1 certainly represents a function—since each passes
the vertical line test. In other words, as you sweep a vertical line across the graph of each
function, the line never intersects the graph more than once. If it did, then the graph
would not represent a function.
Bounded. The graph in (c) appears to approach zero as x goes to both positive and
negative infinity. It also never exceeds the value 1 or drops below the value 0. Because the

Function Types: (a) a discontinuous function, (b) a continuous function, (c)
a bounded, diﬀerentiable function, (d) an unbounded, diﬀerentiable function

graph never increases or decreases without bound, we say that the function represented by
the graph in (c) is a bounded function.
DEFINITION 2.5.1 Bounded
A function f is bounded if there is a number M
such that |f (x)| < M for every x in the domain of f .
For the function in (c), one such choice for M would be 10. However, the smallest
(optimal) choice would be M = 1. In either case, simply finding an M is enough to
establish boundedness. No such M exists for the hyperbola in (d) and hence we can say
that it is unbounded.
Continuity. The graphs shown in (b) and (c) both represent continuous functions.
Geometrically, this is because there are no jumps in the graphs. That is, if you pick a
point on the graph and approach it from the left and right, the values of the function

2.5

approach the value of the function at that point. For example, we can see that this is not
true for function values near x = −1 on the graph in (a) which is not continuous at that
location.
DEFINITION 2.5.2
a if lim f (x) = f (a).

Continuous at a Point

A function f is continuous at a point

x→a

DEFINITION 2.5.3 Continuous
every point in its domain.

A function f is continuous if it is continuous at

Strangely, we can also say that (d) is continuous even though there is a vertical asymptote. A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase “at every point
in its domain.” Because the location of the asymptote, x = 0, is not in the domain of
the function, and because the rest of the function is well-behaved, we can say that (d) is
continuous.
Diﬀerentiability. Now that we have introduced the derivative of a function at a point,
we can begin to use the adjective diﬀerentiable. We can see that the tangent line is welldefined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we can say that (c) is a diﬀerentiable
function.
DEFINITION 2.5.4
point a if f ′ (a) exists.

Diﬀerentiable at a Point

A function f is diﬀerentiable at

DEFINITION 2.5.5 Diﬀerentiable A function f is diﬀerentiable if is diﬀerentiable
at every point (excluding endpoints and isolated points in the domain of f ) in the domain
of f .
Take note that, for technical reasons not discussed here, both of these definitions
exclude endpoints and isolated points in the domain from consideration.
We now have a collection of adjectives to describe the very rich and complex set of
objects known as functions.
We close with a useful theorem about continuous functions:
THEOREM 2.5.6 Intermediate Value Theorem If f is continuous on the interval
[a, b] and d is between f (a) and f (b), then there is a number c in [a, b] such that f (c) = d.

This is most frequently used when d = 0.

54 Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative
EXAMPLE 2.5.7 Explain why the function f = x3 + 3x2 + x − 2 has a root between
0 and 1.
By theorem 2.3.6, f is continuous. Since f (0) = −2 and f (1) = 3, and 0 is between
−2 and 3, there is a c ∈ [0, 1] such that f (c) = 0.
This example also points the way to a simple method for approximating roots.
EXAMPLE 2.5.8 Approximate the root of the previous example to one decimal place.
If we compute f (0.1), f (0.2), and so on, we find that f (0.6) < 0 and f (0.7) > 0, so by
the Intermediate Value Theorem, f has a root between 0.6 and 0.7. Repeating the process
with f (0.61), f (0.62), and so on, we find that f (0.61) < 0 and f (0.62) > 0, so f has a root
between 0.61 and 0.62, and the root is 0.6 rounded to one decimal place.

Rules for Finding Derivatives

It is tedious to compute a limit every time we need to know the derivative of a function.
Fortunately, we can develop a small collection of examples and rules that allow us to
compute the derivative of almost any function we are likely to encounter. Many functions
involve quantities raised to a constant power, such as polynomials and more complicated
combinations like y = (sin x)4 . So we start by examining powers of a single variable; this
gives us a building block for more complicated examples.
3.1

The Power Rule

We start with the derivative of a power function, f (x) = xn . Here n is a number of
any kind: integer, rational, positive, negative, even irrational, as in xπ . We have already
computed some simple examples, so the formula should not be a complete surprise:
d n
x = nxn−1 .
dx
It is not easy to show this is true for any n. We will do some of the easier cases now, and
discuss the rest later.
The easiest, and most common, is the case that n is a positive integer. To compute
the derivative we need to compute the following limit:
d n
(x + ∆x)n − xn
x = lim
.
∆x→0
dx
∆x
For a specific, fairly small value of n, we could do this by straightforward algebra.

.
∆x→0
∆x
= lim 3x2 + 3x∆x + ∆x2 = 3x2 .
∆x→0

The general case is really not much harder as long as we don’t try to do too much.
The key is understanding what happens when (x + ∆x)n is multiplied out:
(x + ∆x)n = xn + nxn−1 ∆x + a2 xn−2 ∆x2 + · · · + +an−1 x∆xn−1 + ∆xn .
We know that multiplying out will give a large number of terms all of the form xi ∆xj , and
in fact that i + j = n in every term. One way to see this is to understand that one method
for multiplying out (x + ∆x)n is the following: In every (x + ∆x) factor, pick either the x
or the ∆x, then multiply the n choices together; do this in all possible ways. For example,
for (x + ∆x)3 , there are eight possible ways to do this:
(x + ∆x)(x + ∆x)(x + ∆x) = xxx + xx∆x + x∆xx + x∆x∆x
+ ∆xxx + ∆xx∆x + ∆x∆xx + ∆x∆x∆x
= x3 + x2 ∆x + x2 ∆x + x∆x2
+ x2 ∆x + x∆x2 + x∆x2 + ∆x3
= x3 + 3x2 ∆x + 3x∆x2 + ∆x3
No matter what n is, there are n ways to pick ∆x in one factor and x in the remaining
n−1 factors; this means one term is nxn−1 ∆x. The other coeﬃcients are somewhat harder
to understand, but we don’t really need them, so in the formula above they have simply
been called a2 , a3 , and so on. We know that every one of these terms contains ∆x to at
least the power 2. Now let’s look at the limit:
d n
(x + ∆x)n − xn
x = lim

Now without much trouble we can verify the formula for negative integers. First let’s
look at an example:

We will later see why the other cases of the power rule work, but from now on we will
use the power rule whenever n is any real number. Let’s note here a simple case in which
the power rule applies, or almost applies, but is not really needed. Suppose that f (x) = 1;
remember that this “1” is a function, not “merely” a number, and that f (x) = 1 has a
graph that is a horizontal line, with slope zero everywhere. So we know that f ′ (x) = 0.
We might also write f (x) = x0 , though there is some question about just what this means
at x = 0. If we apply the power rule, we get f ′ (x) = 0x−1 = 0/x = 0, again noting that
there is a problem at x = 0. So the power rule “works” in this case, but it’s really best to
just remember that the derivative of any constant function is zero.

3.2

Linearity of the Derivative

An operation is linear if it behaves “nicely” with respect to multiplication by a constant
and addition. The name comes from the equation of a line through the origin, f (x) = mx,
and the following two properties of this equation. First, f (cx) = m(cx) = c(mx) = cf (x),
so the constant c can be “moved outside” or “moved through” the function f . Second,
f (x + y) = m(x + y) = mx + my = f (x) + f (y), so the addition symbol likewise can be
moved through the function.
The corresponding properties for the derivative are:
(cf (x))′ =

d
d
cf (x) = c f (x) = cf ′ (x),
dx

and
(f (x) + g(x))′ =

d
d
d
(f (x) + g(x)) =
f (x) +
g(x) = f ′ (x) + g ′ (x).
dx

dx

It is easy to see, or at least to believe, that these are true by thinking of the distance/speed interpretation of derivatives. If one object is at position f (t) at time t, we
know its speed is given by f ′ (t). Suppose another object is at position 5f (t) at time t,
namely, that it is always 5 times as far along the route as the first object. Then it “must”
be going 5 times as fast at all times.
The second rule is somewhat more complicated, but here is one way to picture it.
Suppose a flat bed railroad car is at position f (t) at time t, so the car is traveling at a
speed of f ′ (t) (to be specific, let’s say that f (t) gives the position on the track of the rear
end of the car). Suppose that an ant is crawling from the back of the car to the front so
that its position on the car is g(t) and its speed relative to the car is g ′ (t). Then in reality,
at time t, the ant is at position f (t) + g(t) along the track, and its speed is “obviously”
f ′ (t) + g ′ (t).
We don’t want to rely on some more-or-less obvious physical interpretation to determine what is true mathematically, so let’s see how to verify these rules by computation.

3.3

The Product Rule

Consider the product of two simple functions, say f (x) = (x2 + 1)(x3 − 3x). An obvious
guess for the derivative of f is the product of the derivatives of the constituent functions:
(2x)(3x2 −3) = 6x3 −6x. Is this correct? We can easily check, by rewriting f and doing the
calculation in a way that is known to work. First, f (x) = x5 −3x3 +x3 −3x = x5 −2x3 −3x,
and then f ′ (x) = 5x4 − 6x2 − 3. Not even close! What went “wrong”? Well, nothing really,
except the guess was wrong.
So the derivative of f (x)g(x) is NOT as simple as f ′ (x)g ′ (x). Surely there is some
rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to “discover” it by trying to do
the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.

A couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, “add and subtract
the same thing”, to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting,
we realize that we have two limits that produce f ′ (x) and g ′ (x). Of course, f ′ (x) and

3.3

The Product Rule

61

g ′ (x) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced lim f (x + ∆x) with
∆x→0

f (x)—why is this justified?
What we really need to know here is that lim f (x + ∆x) = f (x), or in the language
∆x→0

of section 2.5, that f is continuous at x. We already know that f ′ (x) exists (or the whole
approach, writing the derivative of f g in terms of f ′ and g ′ , doesn’t make sense). This
turns out to imply that f is continuous as well. Here’s why:
lim f (x + ∆x) = lim (f (x + ∆x) − f (x) + f (x))

Returning to the example we started with, let f (x) = (x2 + 1)(x3 − 3x). Then f ′ (x) =
(x2 + 1)(3x2 − 3) + (2x)(x3 − 3x) = 3x4 − 3x2 + 3x2 − 3 + 2x4 − 6x2 = 5x4 − 6x2 − 3,
as before. In this case it is probably simpler to multiply f (x) out first, then compute the
derivative; here’s an example for which we really need the product rule.

3.4

The Quotient Rule

What is the derivative of (x2 + 1)/(x3 − 3x)? More generally, we’d like to have a formula
to compute the derivative of f (x)/g(x) if we already know f ′ (x) and g ′ (x). Instead of
attacking this problem head-on, let’s notice that we’ve already done part of the problem:
f (x)/g(x) = f (x) · (1/g(x)), that is, this is “really” a product, and we can compute the
derivative if we know f ′ (x) and (1/g(x))′ . So really the only new bit of information we
need is (1/g(x))′ in terms of g ′ (x). As with the product rule, let’s set this up and see how

Occasionally you will need to compute the derivative of a quotient with a constant
numerator, like 10/x2 . Of course you can use the quotient rule, but it is usually not the
easiest method. If we do use it here, we get

The Chain Rule

So far we have seen how to compute the derivative of a function built up from other
functions by addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. There is another very
important way that we combine simple functions to make more complicated functions:
√
function composition, as discussed in section 2.3. For example, consider 625 − x2 . This
function has many simpler components, like 625 and x2 , and then there is that square root
√
symbol, so the square root function x = x1/2 is involved. The obvious question is: can
√
we compute the derivative using the derivatives of the constituents 625 − x2 and x? We
can indeed. In general, if f (x) and g(x) are functions, we can compute the derivatives of
f (g(x)) and g(f (x)) in terms of f ′ (x) and g ′ (x).
√
Form the two possible compositions of f (x) = x and g(x) =
√
625 − x2 and compute the derivatives. First, f (g(x)) = 625 − x2 , and the derivative
√
√
is −x/ 625 − x2 as we have seen. Second, g(f (x)) = 625 − ( x)2 = 625 − x with derivative −1. Of course, these calculations do not use anything new, and in particular the
derivative of f (g(x)) was somewhat tedious to compute from the definition.
EXAMPLE 3.5.1

Suppose we want the derivative of f (g(x)). Again, let’s set up the derivative and play
some algebraic tricks:
f (g(x + ∆x)) − f (g(x))
d
f (g(x)) = lim
∆x→0
dx
∆x
f (g(x + ∆x)) − f (g(x)) g(x + ∆x)) − g(x)
= lim
∆x→0
g(x + ∆x)) − g(x)
∆x
Now we see immediately that the second fraction turns into g ′ (x) when we take the limit.
The first fraction is more complicated, but it too looks something like a derivative. The
denominator, g(x + ∆x)) − g(x), is a change in the value of g, so let’s abbreviate it as

66 Chapter 3 Rules for Finding Derivatives
∆g = g(x + ∆x)) − g(x), which also means g(x + ∆x) = g(x) + ∆g. This gives us
f (g(x) + ∆g) − f (g(x))
.
∆x→0
∆g
lim

As ∆x goes to 0, it is also true that ∆g goes to 0, because g(x + ∆x) goes to g(x). So we
can rewrite this limit as
f (g(x) + ∆g) − f (g(x))
lim
.
∆g→0
∆g
Now this looks exactly like a derivative, namely f ′ (g(x)), that is, the function f ′ (x) with
x replaced by g(x). If this all withstands scrutiny, we then get
d
f (g(x)) = f ′ (g(x))g ′ (x).
dx
Unfortunately, there is a small flaw in the argument. Recall that what we mean by lim∆x→0
involves what happens when ∆x is close to 0 but not equal to 0. The qualification is very
important, since we must be able to divide by ∆x. But when ∆x is close to 0 but not equal
to 0, ∆g = g(x + ∆x)) − g(x) is close to 0 and possibly equal to 0. This means it doesn’t
really make sense to divide by ∆g. Fortunately, it is possible to recast the argument to
avoid this diﬃculty, but it is a bit tricky; we will not include the details, which can be
found in many calculus books. Note that many functions g do have the property that
g(x + ∆x) − g(x) ̸= 0 when ∆x is small, and for these functions the argument above is
fine.
The chain rule has a particularly simple expression if we use the Leibniz notation for
the derivative. The quantity f ′ (g(x)) is the derivative of f with x replaced by g; this can
be written df /dg. As usual, g ′ (x) = dg/dx. Then the chain rule becomes
df
df dg
=
.
dx
dg dx
This looks like trivial arithmetic, but it is not: dg/dx is not a fraction, that is, not literal
division, but a single symbol that means g ′ (x). Nevertheless, it turns out that what looks
like trivial arithmetic, and is therefore easy to remember, is really true.
It will take a bit of practice to make the use of the chain rule come naturally—it is
more complicated than the earlier diﬀerentiation rules we have seen.
√
EXAMPLE 3.5.2 Compute the derivative of 625 − x2 . We already know that the
√
answer is −x/ 625 − x2 , computed directly from the limit. In the context of the chain
√
rule, we have f (x) = x, g(x) = 625 − x2 . We know that f ′ (x) = (1/2)x−1/2 , so

3.5

f ′ (g(x)) = (1/2)(625 − x2 )−1/2 . Note that this is a two step computation: first compute
f ′ (x), then replace x by g(x). Since g ′ (x) = −2x we have

EXAMPLE 3.5.3 Compute the derivative of 1/ 625 − x2 . This is a quotient with a
constant numerator, so we could use the quotient rule, but it is simpler to use the chain
rule. The function is (625 − x2 )−1/2 , the composition of f (x) = x−1/2 and g(x) = 625 − x2 .
We compute f ′ (x) = (−1/2)x−3/2 using the power rule, and then
f ′ (g(x))g ′ (x) =

to compute the derivative of a complicated function.
EXAMPLE 3.5.4

Compute the derivative of

f (x) = √

The “last” operation here is division, so to get started we need to use the quotient rule
first. This gives

product rule:

Note that we already had the derivative on the second line; all the rest is simplification. It
is easier to get to this answer by using the quotient rule, so there’s a trade oﬀ: more work
for fewer memorized formulas.

Transcendental Functions

So far we have used only algebraic functions as examples when finding derivatives, that is,
functions that can be built up by the usual algebraic operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and raising to constant powers. Both in theory and practice there
are other functions, called transcendental, that are very useful. Most important among
these are the trigonometric functions, the inverse trigonometric functions, exponential
functions, and logarithms.
4.1

Trigonometric Functions

When you first encountered the trigonometric functions it was probably in the context of
“triangle trigonometry,” defining, for example, the sine of an angle as the “side opposite
over the hypotenuse.” While this will still be useful in an informal way, we need to use a
more expansive definition of the trigonometric functions. First an important note: while
degree measure of angles is sometimes convenient because it is so familiar, it turns out to
be ill-suited to mathematical calculation, so (almost) everything we do will be in terms of
radian measure of angles.

71

To define the radian measurement system, we consider the unit circle in the xy-plane:

An angle, x, at the center of the circle is associated with an arc of the circle which is said
to subtend the angle. In the figure, this arc is the portion of the circle from point (1, 0)
to point A. The length of this arc is the radian measure of the angle x; the fact that the
radian measure is an actual geometric length is largely responsible for the usefulness of
radian measure. The circumference of the unit circle is 2πr = 2π(1) = 2π, so the radian
measure of the full circular angle (that is, of the 360 degree angle) is 2π.
While an angle with a particular measure can appear anywhere around the circle, we
need a fixed, conventional location so that we can use the coordinate system to define
properties of the angle. The standard convention is to place the starting radius for the
angle on the positive x-axis, and to measure positive angles counterclockwise around the
circle. In the figure, x is the standard location of the angle π/6, that is, the length of the
arc from (1, 0) to A is π/6. The angle y in the picture is −π/6, because the distance from
(1, 0) to B along the circle is also π/6, but in a clockwise direction.
Now the fundamental trigonometric definitions are: the cosine of x and the sine of x
are the first and second coordinates of the point A, as indicated in the figure. The angle x
shown can be viewed as an angle of a right triangle, meaning the usual triangle definitions
of the sine and cosine also make sense. Since the hypotenuse of the triangle is 1, the “side
opposite over hypotenuse” definition of the sine is the second coordinate of point A over
1, which is just the second coordinate; in other words, both methods give the same value
for the sine.
The simple triangle definitions work only for angles that can “fit” in a right triangle,
namely, angles between 0 and π/2. The coordinate definitions, on the other hand, apply

to any angles, as indicated in this figure:

The angle x is subtended by the heavy arc in the figure, that is, x = 7π/6. Both
coordinates of point A in this figure are negative, so the sine and cosine of 7π/6 are both
negative.
The remaining trigonometric functions can be most easily defined in terms of the sine
and cosine, as usual:
sin x
tan x =
cos x
cos x
cot x =
sin x
1
sec x =
cos x
1
csc x =
sin x
and they can also be defined as the corresponding ratios of coordinates.
Although the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the unit circle, the unit
circle diagram is not what we normally consider the graph of a trigonometric function.
(The unit circle is the graph of, well, the circle.) We can easily get a qualitatively correct
idea of the graphs of the trigonometric functions from the unit circle diagram. Consider
the sine function, y = sin x. As x increases from 0 in the unit circle diagram, the second
coordinate of the point A goes from 0 to a maximum of 1, then back to 0, then to a
minimum of −1, then back to 0, and then it obviously repeats itself. So the graph of
y = sin x must look something like this:

The Derivative of

sin x

What about the derivative of the sine function? The rules for derivatives that we have are
no help, since sin x is not an algebraic function. We need to return to the definition of the
derivative, set up a limit, and try to compute it. Here’s the definition:
d
sin(x + ∆x) − sin x
sin x = lim
.
∆x→0
dx
∆x
Using some trigonometric identities, we can make a little progress on the quotient:
sin(x + ∆x) − sin x
sin x cos ∆x + sin ∆x cos x − sin x
=

cos ∆x − 1

This isolates the diﬃcult bits in the two limits

and

sin ∆x
.
∆x→0 ∆x

Here we get a little lucky: it turns out that once we know the second limit the first is quite
easy. The second is quite tricky, however. Indeed, it is the hardest limit we will actually
compute, and we devote a section to it.
4.3

A hard limit

We want to compute this limit:
sin ∆x
.
∆x→0 ∆x
lim

Equivalently, to make the notation a bit simpler, we can compute
sin x
.
x→0 x
lim

In the original context we need to keep x and ∆x separate, but here it doesn’t hurt to
rename ∆x to something more convenient.
To do this we need to be quite clever, and to employ some indirect reasoning. The
indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the squeeze theorem.
THEOREM 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem
Suppose that g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x) for all x
close to a but not equal to a. If limx→a g(x) = L = limx→a h(x), then limx→a f (x) = L.
This theorem can be proved using the oﬃcial definition of limit. We won’t prove it
here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition
says that f (x) is trapped between g(x) below and h(x) above, and that at x = a, both g
and h approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1.
The wiggly curve is x2 sin(π/x), the upper and lower curves are x2 and −x2 . Since the
sine function is always between −1 and 1, −x2 ≤ x2 sin(π/x) ≤ x2 , and it is easy to see
that limx→0 −x2 = 0 = limx→0 x2 . It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically,
that limx→0 x2 sin(π/x) = 0, because the π/x prevents us from simply plugging in x = 0.
The squeeze theorem makes this “hard limit” as easy as the trivial limits involving x2 .
To do the hard limit that we want, limx→0 (sin x)/x, we will find two simpler functions
g and h so that g(x) ≤ (sin x)/x ≤ h(x), and so that limx→0 g(x) = limx→0 h(x). Not too
surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2,
x is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius 1, the coordinates of

is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and
the circle from (1, 0) to point A. Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we
see (cos x sin x)/2 ≤ x/2, since the area of a circular region with angle θ and radius r is
θr2 /2. With a little algebra this turns into (sin x)/x ≤ 1/ cos x, giving us the h we seek.

To find g, we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger
triangle. The height of the triangle, from (1, 0) to point B, is tan x, so comparing areas we
get x/2 ≤ (tan x)/2 = sin x/(2 cos x). With a little algebra this becomes cos x ≤ (sin x)/x.

Finally, the two limits limx→0 cos x and limx→0 1/ cos x are easy, because cos(0) = 1. By
the squeeze theorem, limx→0 (sin x)/x = 1 as well.
Before we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other
limit:

This limit is just as hard as sin x/x, but closely related to it, so that we don’t have to do
a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.

Notice that where the cosine is zero the sine does appear to have a horizontal tangent
line, and that the sine appears to be steepest where the cosine takes on its extreme values
of 1 and −1.
Of course, now that we know the derivative of the sine, we can compute derivatives of
more complicated functions involving the sine.

Exponential and Logarithmic functions

An exponential function has the form ax , where a is a constant; examples are 2x , 10x , ex .
The logarithmic functions are the inverses of the exponential functions, that is, functions
that “undo” the exponential functions, just as, for example, the cube root function “un√
3
does” the cube function: 23 = 2. Note that the original function also undoes the inverse
√
3
function: ( 8)3 = 8.
Let f (x) = 2x . The inverse of this function is called the logarithm base 2, denoted
log2 (x) or (especially in computer science circles) lg(x). What does this really mean? The
logarithm must undo the action of the exponential function, so for example it must be that
lg(23 ) = 3—starting with 3, the exponential function produces 23 = 8, and the logarithm
of 8 must get us back to 3. A little thought shows that it is not a coincidence that lg(23 )
simply gives the exponent—the exponent is the original value that we must get back to.
In other words, the logarithm is the exponent. Remember this catchphrase, and what it
means, and you won’t go wrong. (You do have to remember what it means. Like any
good mnemonic, “the logarithm is the exponent” leaves out a lot of detail, like “Which
exponent?” and “Exponent of what?”)
EXAMPLE 4.6.1 What is the value of log10 (1000)? The “10” tells us the appropriate
number to use for the base of the exponential function. The logarithm is the exponent,
so the question is, what exponent E makes 10E = 1000? If we can find such an E, then
log10 (1000) = log10 (10E ) = E; finding the appropriate exponent is the same as finding the
logarithm. In this case, of course, it is easy: E = 3 so log10 (1000) = 3.
Let’s review some laws of exponents and logarithms; let a be a positive number. Since
a = a · a · a · a · a and a3 = a · a · a, it’s clear that a5 · a3 = a · a · a · a · a · a · a · a = a8 = a5+3 ,
and in general that am an = am+n . Since “the logarithm is the exponent,” it’s no surprise
that this translates directly into a fact about the logarithm function. Here are three facts
5

4.6

Exponential and Logarithmic functions

81

from the example: loga (a5 ) = 5, loga (a3 ) = 3, loga (a8 ) = 8. So loga (a5 a3 ) = loga (a8 ) =
8 = 5 + 3 = loga (a5 ) + loga (a3 ). Now let’s make this a bit more general. Suppose A and
B are two numbers, A = ax , and B = ay . Then loga (AB) = loga (ax ay ) = loga (ax+y ) =
x + y = loga (A) + loga (B).
Now consider (a5 )3 = a5 · a5 · a5 = a5+5+5 = a5·3 = a15 . Again it’s clear that more
generally (am )n = amn , and again this gives us a fact about logarithms. If A = ax then
Ay = (ax )y = axy , so loga (Ay ) = xy = y loga (A)—the exponent can be “pulled out in
front.”
We have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that a5 = a·a·a·a·a
and a3 = a · a · a and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example.
But when we consider an exponential function ax we can’t be limited to substituting
integers for x. What does a2.5 or a−1.3 or aπ mean? And is it really true that a2.5 a−1.3 =
a2.5−1.3 ? The answer to the first question is actually quite diﬃcult, so we will evade it;
the answer to the second question is “yes.”
We’ll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about
exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it’s not “obvious” what 2x
should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the
behavior that is obvious, namely, when x is a positive integer. What else do we want to
be true about 2x ? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for
all exponents: 2x 2y = 2x+y and (2x )y = 2xy .
After the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: 20 = 1. You
have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because
we want 2a 2b = 2a+b to be true about the function 2x . We need it to be true that
20 2x = 20+x = 2x , and this only works if 20 = 1. The same argument implies that a0 = 1
for any a.
The next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example,
−3
2 = 1/23 . We know that whatever 2−3 means it must be that 2−3 23 = 2−3+3 = 20 = 1,
which means that 2−3 must be 1/23 . In fact, by the same argument, once we know what
2x means for some value of x, 2−x must be 1/2x and more generally a−x = 1/ax .
Next, consider an exponent 1/q, where q is a positive integer. We want it to be true
√
q
that (2x )y = 2xy , so (21/q )q = 2. This means that 21/q is a q-th root of 2, 21/q = 2 . This
√
√
is all we need to understand that 2p/q = (21/q )p = ( q 2 )p and ap/q = (a1/q )p = ( q a )p .
What’s left is the hard part: what does 2x mean when x cannot be written as a
√
fraction, like x = 2 or x = π? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to 2x

82 Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions
whenever x = p/q; if we were to graph this we’d see something like this:

But this is a poor picture, because you can’t see that the “curve” is really a whole lot
of individual points, above the rational numbers on the x-axis. There are really a lot of
“holes” in the curve, above x = π, for example. But (this is the hard part) it is possible
to prove that the holes can be “filled in”, and that the resulting function, called 2x , really
does have the properties we want, namely that 2x 2y = 2x+y and (2x )y = 2xy .

Derivatives of the exponential and
logarithmic functions

As with the sine, we don’t know anything about derivatives that allows us to compute
the derivatives of the exponential and logarithmic functions without going back to basics.
Let’s do a little work with the definition again:

Derivatives of the exponential and logarithmic functions

There are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left
with a limit that involves ∆x but not x, which means that whatever lim (a∆x − 1)/∆x
∆x→0

is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that ax has a remarkable
property: its derivative is a constant times itself.
We earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is lim sin x/x = 1; we
x→0

now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to
see that lim (a∆x − 1)/∆x even exists—does this fraction really get closer and closer to
∆x→0

some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.
We can look at some examples. Consider (2x − 1)/x for some small values of x: 1,
0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when x is 1, 1/2, 1/4,
1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out
to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next (3x − 1)/x: 2, 1.464101616,
1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of x. It turns out
to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don’t establish a pattern, but
if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of a:
bigger a, bigger limit; smaller a, smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits
will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between a = 2 and a = 3 the limit
will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called e, so that
e∆x − 1
= 1.
∆x→0
∆x
lim

As you might guess from our two examples, e is closer to 3 than to 2, and in fact e ≈ 2.718.
Now we see that the function ex has a truly remarkable property:

That is, ex is its own derivative, or in other words the slope of ex is the same as its height,
or the same as its second coordinate: The function f (x) = ex goes through the point
(z, ez ) and has slope ez there, no matter what z is. It is sometimes convenient to express
the function ex without an exponent, since complicated exponents can be hard to read. In

such cases we use exp(x), e.g., exp(1 + x2 ) instead of e1+x .

84 Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions
What about the logarithm function? This too is hard, but as the cosine function was
easier to do once the sine was done, so the logarithm is easier to do now that we know
the derivative of the exponential function. Let’s start with loge x, which as you probably
know is often abbreviated ln x and called the “natural logarithm” function.
Consider the relationship between the two functions, namely, that they are inverses,
that one “undoes” the other. Graphically this means that they have the same graph except
that one is “flipped” or “reflected” through the line y = x, as shown in figure 4.7.1.

The exponential and logarithm functions.

This means that the slopes of these two functions are closely related as well: For example,
the slope of ex is e at x = 1; at the corresponding point on the ln(x) curve, the slope must
be 1/e, because the “rise” and the “run” have been interchanged. Since the slope of ex is
e at the point (1, e), the slope of ln(x) is 1/e at the point (e, 1).

Slope of the exponential and logarithm functions.

More generally, we know that the slope of ex is ez at the point (z, ez ), so the slope of
ln(x) is 1/ez at (ez , z), as indicated in figure 4.7.2. In other words, the slope of ln x is the
reciprocal of the first coordinate at any point; this means that the slope of ln x at (x, ln x)
is 1/x. The upshot is:

Derivatives of the exponential and logarithmic functions

We have discussed this from the point of view of the graphs, which is easy to understand
but is not normally considered a rigorous proof—it is too easy to be led astray by pictures
that seem reasonable but that miss some hard point. It is possible to do this derivation
without resorting to pictures, and indeed we will see an alternate approach soon.
Note that ln x is defined only for x > 0. It is sometimes useful to consider the function
ln |x|, a function defined for x ̸= 0. When x < 0, ln |x| = ln(−x) and

ln |x| =

Thus whether x is positive or negative, the derivative is the same.
What about the functions ax and loga x? We know that the derivative of ax is some
constant times ax itself, but what constant? Remember that “the logarithm is the exponent” and you will see that a = eln a . Then
ax = (eln a )x = ex ln a ,
and we can compute the derivative using the chain rule:
d x
d ln a x
d x ln a
a =
(e ) =
e
= (ln a)ex ln a = (ln a)ax .
dx
dx
dx
The constant is simply ln a. Likewise we can compute the derivative of the logarithm
function loga x. Since
x = eln x
we can take the logarithm base a of both sides to get
loga (x) = loga (eln x ) = ln x loga e.
Then
d
1
loga x = loga e.
dx

This is a perfectly good answer, but we can improve it slightly. Since
a = eln a
loga (a) = loga (eln a ) = ln a loga e
1 = ln a loga e

= loga e,

Because the “trick” a = eln a is often useful, and sometimes essential, it may be better to

Implicit Differentiation

As we have seen, there is a close relationship between the derivatives of ex and ln x because
these functions are inverses. Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we
would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique
can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an
inverse function.

88 Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions
We will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative
of ln x. Let’s write y = ln x and then x = eln x = ey , that is, x = ey . We say that
this equation defines the function y = ln x implicitly because while it is not an explicit
expression y = . . ., it is true that if x = ey then y is in fact the natural logarithm function.
Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of y is that x = ey ; what can we say
about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:
d
d y
x=
e .
dx
dx
Then using the chain rule on the right hand side:
(
1=

)
d
y ey = y ′ ey .
dx

Then we can solve for y ′ :
y′ =

1
1
= .
y
e
x

There is one little diﬃculty here. To use the chain rule to compute d/dx(ey ) = y ′ ey we
need to know that the function y has a derivative. All we have shown is that if it has a
derivative then that derivative must be 1/x. When using this method we will always have
to assume that the desired derivative exists, but fortunately this is a safe assumption for
most such problems.
The example y = ln x involved an inverse function defined implicitly, but other functions can be defined implicitly, and sometimes a single equation can be used to implicitly
define more than one function. Here’s a familiar example. The equation r2 = x2 + y 2
describes a circle of radius r. The circle is not a function y = f (x) because for some values
of x there are two corresponding values of y. If we want to work with a function, we can
break the circle into two pieces, the upper and lower semicircles, each of which is a function.
Let’s call these y = U (x) and y = L(x); in fact this is a fairly simple example, and it’s
√
√
possible to give explicit expressions for these: U (x) = r2 − x2 and L(x) = − r2 − x2 .
But it’s somewhat easier, and quite useful, to view both functions as given implicitly by
r2 = x2 + y 2 : both r2 = x2 + U (x)2 and r2 = x2 + L(x)2 are true, and we can think of
r2 = x2 + y 2 as defining both U (x) and L(x).
Now we can take the derivative of both sides as before, remembering that y is not
simply a variable but a function—in this case, y is either U (x) or L(x) but we’re not yet
specifying which one. When we take the derivative we just have to remember to apply the

4.8

chain rule where y appears.

d 2
r =
(x + y 2 )
dx
dx
0 = 2x + 2yy ′
y′ =

−2x

2y
y

Now we have an expression for y ′ , but it contains y as well as x. This means that if we
want to compute y ′ for some particular value of x we’ll have to know or compute y at that
value of x as well. It is at this point that we will need to know whether y is U (x) or L(x).
Occasionally it will turn out that we can avoid explicit use of U (x) or L(x) by the nature
of the problem
√
EXAMPLE 4.8.1 Find the slope of the circle 4 = x2 + y 2 at the point (1, − 3). Since
we know both the x and y coordinates of the point of interest, we do not need to explicitly
recognize that this point is on L(x), and we do not need to use L(x) to compute y—but
we could. Using the calculation of y ′ from above,
y′ = −

1
x
1
=− √ = √ .
y

It is instructive to compare this approach to others.
√
We might have recognized at the start that (1, − 3) is on the function y = L(x) =
√
− 4 − x2 . We could then take the derivative of L(x), using the power rule and the chain
rule, to get
1
x
L′ (x) = − (4 − x2 )−1/2 (−2x) = √
.
2
4 − x2
√
Then we could compute L′ (1) = 1/ 3 by substituting x = 1.
Alternately, we could realize that the point is on L(x), but use the fact that y ′ = −x/y.
Since the point is on L(x) we can replace y by L(x) to get
y′ = −

x
x
=√
,
L(x)
4 − x2

without computing the derivative of L(x) explicitly. Then we substitute x = 1 and get the
same answer as before.
In the case of the circle it is possible to find the functions U (x) and L(x) explicitly, but
there are potential advantages to using implicit diﬀerentiation anyway. In some cases it is
more diﬃcult or impossible to find an explicit formula for y and implicit diﬀerentiation is
the only way to find the derivative.

90 Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions
EXAMPLE 4.8.2 Find the derivative of any function defined implicitly by yx2 +ey = x.
We treat y as an unspecified function and use the chain rule:
d
d
(yx2 + ey ) =
x
dx
dx
(y · 2x + y ′ · x2 ) + y ′ ey = 1
y ′ x2 + y ′ ey = 1 − 2xy
y ′ (x2 + ey ) = 1 − 2xy
y′ =

1 − 2xy
x2 + ey

You might think that the step in which we solve for y ′ could sometimes be diﬃcult—
after all, we’re using implicit diﬀerentiation here because we can’t solve the equation
yx2 + ey = x for y, so maybe after taking the derivative we get something that is hard to
solve for y ′ . In fact, this never happens. All occurrences y ′ come from applying the chain
rule, and whenever the chain rule is used it deposits a single y ′ multiplied by some other
expression. So it will always be possible to group the terms containing y ′ together and
factor out the y ′ , just as in the previous example. If you ever get anything more diﬃcult
you have made a mistake and should fix it before trying to continue.
It is sometimes the case that a situation leads naturally to an equation that defines a
function implicitly.
EXAMPLE 4.8.3 Consider all the points (x, y) that have the property that the distance
from (x, y) to (x1 , y1 ) plus the distance from (x, y) to (x2 , y2 ) is 2a (a is some constant).
These points form an ellipse, which like a circle is not a function but can viewed as two
functions pasted together. Because we know how to write down the distance between two
points, we can write down an implicit equation for the ellipse:
√
√
(x − x1 )2 + (y − y1 )2 + (x − x2 )2 + (y − y2 )2 = 2a.
Then we can use implicit diﬀerentiation to find the slope of the ellipse at any point, though
the computation is rather messy.
EXAMPLE 4.8.4 We have already justified the power rule by using the exponential
function, but we could also do it for rational exponents by using implicit diﬀerentiation.
Suppose that y = xm/n , where m and n are positive integers. We can write this implicitly
as y n = xm , then because we justified the power rule for integers, we can take the derivative

Definition. Two curves are orthogonal if at each point of intersection, the angle between
their tangent lines is π/2. Two families of curves, A and B, are orthogonal trajectories of each
other if given any curve C in A and any curve D in B the curves C and D are orthogonal. For
example, the family of horizontal lines in the plane is orthogonal to the family of vertical lines in
the plane.

orthogonal to each other?

Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The trigonometric functions frequently arise in problems, and often it is necessary to
invert the functions, for example, to find an angle with a specified sine. Of course, there
are many angles with the same sine, so the sine function doesn’t actually have an inverse
that reliably “undoes” the sine function. If you know that sin x = 0.5, you can’t reverse
this to discover x, that is, you can’t solve for x, as there are infinitely many angles with
sine 0.5. Nevertheless, it is useful to have something like an inverse to the sine, however
imperfect. The usual approach is to pick out some collection of angles that produce all
possible values of the sine exactly once. If we “discard” all other angles, the resulting
function does have a proper inverse.
The sine takes on all values between −1 and 1 exactly once on the interval [−π/2, π/2].
If we truncate the sine, keeping only the interval [−π/2, π/2], as shown in figure 4.9.1, then
this truncated sine has an inverse function. We call this the inverse sine or the arcsine,
and write y = arcsin(x).
Recall that a function and its inverse undo each other in either order, for example,
√
√
3
3
( x)3 = x and x3 = x. This does not work with the sine and the “inverse sine” because
the inverse sine is the inverse of the truncated sine function, not the real sine function.
It is true that sin(arcsin(x)) = x, that is, the sine undoes the arcsine. It is not true that
the arcsine undoes the sine, for example, sin(5π/6) = 1/2 and arcsin(1/2) = π/6, so doing
first the sine then the arcsine does not get us back where we started. This is because 5π/6

is not in the domain of the truncated sine. If we start with an angle between −π/2 and
π/2 then the arcsine does reverse the sine: sin(π/6) = 1/2 and arcsin(1/2) = π/6.
What is the derivative of the arcsine? Since this is an inverse function, we can discover
the derivative by using implicit diﬀerentiation. Suppose y = arcsin(x). Then
sin(y) = sin(arcsin(x)) = x.
Now taking the derivative of both sides, we get
y ′ cos y = 1
y′ =

1
cos y

As we expect when using implicit diﬀerentiation, y appears on the right hand side here.
We would certainly prefer to have y ′ written in terms of x, and as in the case of ln x we
can actually do that here. Since sin2 y + cos2 y = 1, cos2 y = 1 − sin2 y = 1 − x2 . So
√
cos y = ± 1 − x2 , but which is it—plus or minus? It could in general be either, but this
isn’t “in general”: since y = arcsin(x) we know that −π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, and the cosine of
√
an angle in this interval is always positive. Thus cos y = 1 − x2 and
1
d
arcsin(x) = √
.
dx
1 − x2
Note that this agrees with figure 4.9.1: the graph of the arcsine has positive slope everywhere.
We can do something similar for the cosine. As with the sine, we must first truncate
the cosine so that it can be inverted, as shown in figure 4.9.2. Then we use implicit

Note that the truncated cosine uses a diﬀerent interval than the truncated sine, so that if

is left as an exercise.
Finally we look at the tangent; the other trigonometric functions also have “partial
inverses” but the sine, cosine and tangent are enough for most purposes. The tangent,
truncated tangent and inverse tangent are shown in figure 4.9.3; the derivative of the
arctangent is left as an exercise.

Limits revisited

We have defined and used the concept of limit, primarily in our development of the derivative. Recall that lim f (x) = L is true if, in a precise sense, f (x) gets closer and closer to
x→a

L as x gets closer and closer to a. While some limits are easy to see, others take some
ingenuity; in particular, the limits that define derivatives are always diﬃcult on their face,
since in
f (x + ∆x) − f (x)
lim
∆x→0
∆x
both the numerator and denominator approach zero. Typically this diﬃculty can be resolved when f is a “nice” function and we are trying to compute a derivative. Occasionally
such limits are interesting for other reasons, and the limit of a fraction in which both numerator and denominator approach zero can be diﬃcult to analyze. Now that we have
the derivative available, there is another technique that can sometimes be helpful in such
circumstances.
Before we introduce the technique, we will also expand our concept of limit, in two
ways. When the limit of f (x) as x approaches a does not exist, it may be useful to note in
what way it does not exist. We have already talked about one such case: one-sided limits.
Another case is when “f goes to infinity”. We also will occasionally want to know what
happens to f when x “goes to infinity”.
EXAMPLE 4.10.1 What happens to 1/x as x goes to 0? From the right, 1/x gets
bigger and bigger, or goes to infinity. From the left it goes to negative infinity.
EXAMPLE 4.10.2 What happens to the function cos(1/x) as x goes to infinity? It
seems clear that as x gets larger and larger, 1/x gets closer and closer to zero, so cos(1/x)
should be getting closer and closer to cos(0) = 1.

96 Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions
As with ordinary limits, these concepts can be made precise. Roughly, we want
lim f (x) = ∞ to mean that we can make f (x) arbitrarily large by making x close enough

x→a

to a, and lim f (x) = L should mean we can make f (x) as close as we want to L by
x→∞

making x large enough. Compare this definition to the definition of limit in section 2.3,
definition 2.3.2.
If f is a function, we say that lim f (x) = ∞ if for every N > 0

DEFINITION 4.10.3

x→a

there is a δ > 0 such that whenever |x − a| < δ, f (x) > N . We can extend this in the
obvious ways to define lim f (x) = −∞, lim− f (x) = ±∞, and lim+ f (x) = ±∞.
x→a

x→a

DEFINITION 4.10.4 Limit at infinity

x→a

If f is a function, we say that lim f (x) = L
x→∞

if for every ϵ > 0 there is an N > 0 so that whenever x > N , |f (x) − L| < ϵ. We may
similarly define lim f (x) = L, and using the idea of the previous definition, we may
x→−∞

define lim f (x) = ±∞.
x→±∞

We include these definitions for completeness, but we will not explore them in detail.
Suﬃce it to say that such limits behave in much the same way that ordinary limits do; in
particular there are some analogs of theorem 2.3.6.
Now consider this limit:
x2 − π 2
.
lim
x→π sin x
As x approaches π, both the numerator and denominator approach zero, so it is not
obvious what, if anything, the quotient approaches. We can often compute such limits by
application of the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.10.5 L’Hôpital’s Rule
For “suﬃciently nice” functions f (x) and
g(x), if lim f (x) = 0 = lim g(x) or both lim f (x) = ±∞ and limx→a g(x) = ±∞, and if
x→a

x→a

x→a

f ′ (x)
f (x)
f ′ (x)
lim ′
exists, then lim
= lim ′
. This remains true if “x → a” is replaced by
x→a g (x)
x→a g(x)
x→a g (x)
“x → ∞” or “x → −∞”.
This theorem is somewhat diﬃcult to prove, in part because it incorporates so many
diﬀerent possibilities, so we will not prove it here. We also will not need to worry about
the precise definition of “suﬃciently nice”, as the functions we encounter will be suitable.

First we use L’Hôpital’s Rule: Since the numerator and denominator both approach
zero,
x2 − π 2
2x
lim
= lim
,
x→π sin x
x→π cos x
provided the latter exists. But in fact this is an easy limit, since the denominator now
approaches −1, so
x2 − π 2
2π
=
= −2π.
lim
x→π sin x
−1
We don’t really need L’Hôpital’s Rule to do this limit. Rewrite it as
lim (x + π)

x→π

and note that
lim

x→π

x−π
sin x

x−π
x−π
x
= lim
= lim −

since x − π approaches zero as x approaches π. Now

x→π

as before.
EXAMPLE 4.10.7

2x2 − 3x + 7
in two ways.
Compute lim 2
x→∞ x + 47x + 1

As x goes to infinity both the numerator and denominator go to infinity, so we may
apply L’Hôpital’s Rule:
2x2 − 3x + 7
4x − 3
= lim
.
2
x→∞ x + 47x + 1
x→∞ 2x + 47
lim

In the second quotient, it is still the case that the numerator and denominator both go to
infinity, so we are allowed to use L’Hôpital’s Rule again:
4x − 3
4
= lim
= 2.
x→∞ 2x + 47
x→∞ 2
lim

So the original limit is 2 as well.
Again, we don’t really need L’Hôpital’s Rule, and in fact a more elementary approach
is easier—we divide the numerator and denominator by x2 :
2x2 − 3x + 7
2x2 − 3x + 7
=
lim
x→∞ x2 + 47x + 1
x→∞ x2 + 47x + 1
lim

1
x2

2 − x3 + x72
.
x→∞ 1 + 47 + 12

x

= lim

Now as x approaches infinity, all the quotients with some power of x in the denominator
approach zero, leaving 2 in the numerator and 1 in the denominator, so the limit again is
2.

EXAMPLE 4.10.9

Compute lim x ln x.
x→0+

This doesn’t appear to be suitable for L’Hôpital’s Rule, but it also is not “obvious”.
As x approaches zero, ln x goes to −∞, so the product looks like (something very small) ·
(something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on how small
and how large. For example, consider (x2 )(1/x), (x)(1/x), and (x)(1/x2 ). As x approaches
zero, each of these is (something very small) · (something very large), yet the limits are
respectively zero, 1, and ∞.
We can in fact turn this into a L’Hôpital’s Rule problem:
x ln x =

ln x
ln x
= −1 .
1/x
x

Now as x approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one
−∞ and one +∞, but only the size is important). Using L’Hôpital’s Rule:
lim+

ln x
1/x

= lim+
= lim+ (−x2 ) = lim+ −x = 0.

x
x→0
x→0 −x
x→0 x

One way to interpret this is that since lim+ x ln x = 0, the x approaches zero much faster
x→0

than the ln x approaches −∞.

Hyperbolic Functions

The hyperbolic functions appear with some frequency in applications, and are quite similar
in many respects to the trigonometric functions. This is a bit surprising given our initial
definitions.
DEFINITION 4.11.1

The hyperbolic cosine is the function
cosh x =

ex + e−x
,
2

and the hyperbolic sine is the function
sinh x =

ex − e−x
.
2

Notice that cosh is even (that is, cosh(−x) = cosh(x)) while sinh is odd (sinh(−x) =
− sinh(x)), and cosh x + sinh x = ex . Also, for all x, cosh x > 0, while sinh x = 0 if and
only if ex − e−x = 0, which is true precisely when x = 0.
LEMMA 4.11.2
Proof.

The range of cosh x is [1, ∞).

Let y = cosh x. We solve for x:
ex + e−x
2
x
2y = e + e−x
y=

2yex = e2x + 1
0 = e2x − 2yex + 1
√
2y ± 4y 2 − 4
x
e =
2
√
ex = y ± y 2 − 1
From the last equation, we see y 2 ≥ 1, and since y ≥ 0, it follows that y ≥ 1.
√
√
Now suppose y ≥ 1, so y ± y 2 − 1 > 0. Then x = ln(y ± y 2 − 1) is a real number,
and y = cosh x, so y is in the range of cosh(x).

The hyperbolic functions: cosh, sinh, tanh, sech, csch, coth.

Certainly the hyperbolic functions do not closely resemble the trigonometric functions
graphically. But they do have analogous properties, beginning with the following identity.
THEOREM 4.11.4
Proof.

For all x in R, cosh2 x − sinh2 x = 1.

The proof is a straightforward computation:

cosh2 x−sinh2 x =

(ex + e−x )2 (ex − e−x )2
e2x + 2 + e−2x − e2x + 2 − e−2x
4
−

= = 1.
4

4

This immediately gives two additional identities:
1 − tanh2 x = sech2 x

and

coth2 x − 1 = csch2 x.

The identity of the theorem also helps to provide a geometric motivation. Recall that
the graph of x2 − y 2 = 1 is a hyperbola with asymptotes x = ±y whose x-intercepts are

2

102 Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions
±1. If (x, y) is a point on the right half of the hyperbola, and if we let x = cosh t, then
√
√
2
y = ± x − 1 = ± cosh2 t − 1 = ± sinh t. So for some suitable t, cosh t and sinh t are
the coordinates of a typical point on the hyperbola. In fact, it turns out that t is twice
the area shown in the first graph of figure 4.11.2. Even this is analogous to trigonometry;
cos t and sin t are the coordinates of a typical point on the unit circle, and t is twice the
area shown in the second graph of figure 4.11.2.

Since cosh x > 0, sinh x is increasing and hence injective, so sinh x has an inverse,
arcsinh x. Also, sinh x > 0 when x > 0, so cosh x is injective on [0, ∞) and has a (partial)
inverse, arccosh x. The other hyperbolic functions have inverses as well, though arcsech x
is only a partial inverse. We may compute the derivatives of these functions as we have
other inverse functions.

Curve Sketching

Whether we are interested in a function as a purely mathematical object or in connection
with some application to the real world, it is often useful to know what the graph of
the function looks like. We can obtain a good picture of the graph using certain crucial
information provided by derivatives of the function and certain limits.
5.1

Maxima and Minima

A local maximum point on a function is a point (x, y) on the graph of the function
whose y coordinate is larger than all other y coordinates on the graph at points “close
to” (x, y). More precisely, (x, f (x)) is a local maximum if there is an interval (a, b) with
a < x < b and f (x) ≥ f (z) for every z in (a, b). Similarly, (x, y) is a local minimum
point if it has locally the smallest y coordinate. Again being more precise: (x, f (x)) is a
local minimum if there is an interval (a, b) with a < x < b and f (x) ≤ f (z) for every z in
(a, b). A local extremum is either a local minimum or a local maximum.
Local maximum and minimum points are quite distinctive on the graph of a function,
and are therefore useful in understanding the shape of the graph. In many applied problems
we want to find the largest or smallest value that a function achieves (for example, we might
want to find the minimum cost at which some task can be performed) and so identifying
maximum and minimum points will be useful for applied problems as well. Some examples
of local maximum and minimum points are shown in figure 5.1.1.
If (x, f (x)) is a point where f (x) reaches a local maximum or minimum, and if the
derivative of f exists at x, then the graph has a tangent line and the tangent line must be
horizontal. This is important enough to state as a theorem, though we will not prove it.

Some local maximum points (A) and minimum points (B).

THEOREM 5.1.1 Fermat’s Theorem
f is diﬀerentiable at a, then f ′ (a) = 0.

If f (x) has a local extremum at x = a and

Thus, the only points at which a function can have a local maximum or minimum
are points at which the derivative is zero, as in the left hand graph in figure 5.1.1, or the
derivative is undefined, as in the right hand graph. Any value of x for which f ′ (x) is zero or
undefined is called a critical value for f . When looking for local maximum and minimum
points, you are likely to make two sorts of mistakes: You may forget that a maximum or
minimum can occur where the derivative does not exist, and so forget to check whether
the derivative exists everywhere. You might also assume that any place that the derivative
is zero is a local maximum or minimum point, but this is not true. A portion of the graph
of f (x) = x3 is shown in figure 5.1.2. The derivative of f is f ′ (x) = 3x2 , and f ′ (0) = 0,
but there is neither a maximum nor minimum at (0, 0).

No maximum or minimum even though the derivative is zero.

Since the derivative is zero or undefined at both local maximum and local minimum
points, we need a way to determine which, if either, actually occurs. The most elementary
approach, but one that is often tedious or diﬃcult, is to test directly whether the y coordinates “near” the potential maximum or minimum are above or below the y coordinate

at the point of interest. Of course, there are too many points “near” the point to test, but
a little thought shows we need only test two provided we know that f is continuous (recall
that this means that the graph of f has no jumps or gaps).
Suppose, for example, that we have identified three points at which f ′ is zero or
nonexistent: (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), (x3 , y3 ), and x1 < x2 < x3 (see figure 5.1.3). Suppose that
we compute the value of f (a) for x1 < a < x2 , and that f (a) < f (x2 ). What can we say
about the graph between a and x2 ? Could there be a point (b, f (b)), a < b < x2 with
f (b) > f (x2 )? No: if there were, the graph would go up from (a, f (a)) to (b, f (b)) then
down to (x2 , f (x2 )) and somewhere in between would have a local maximum point. (This
is not obvious; it is a result of the Extreme Value Theorem, theorem 6.1.2.) But at that
local maximum point the derivative of f would be zero or nonexistent, yet we already
know that the derivative is zero or nonexistent only at x1 , x2 , and x3 . The upshot is that
one computation tells us that (x2 , f (x2 )) has the largest y coordinate of any point on the
graph near x2 and to the left of x2 . We can perform the same test on the right. If we find
that on both sides of x2 the values are smaller, then there must be a local maximum at
(x2 , f (x2 )); if we find that on both sides of x2 the values are larger, then there must be a
local minimum at (x2 , f (x2 )); if we find one of each, then there is neither a local maximum
or minimum at x2 .

Testing for a maximum or minimum.

It is not always easy to compute the value of a function at a particular point. The
task is made easier by the availability of calculators and computers, but they have their
own drawbacks—they do not always allow us to distinguish between values that are very
close together. Nevertheless, because this method is conceptually simple and sometimes
easy to perform, you should always consider it.
EXAMPLE 5.1.2 Find all local maximum and minimum points for the function f (x) =
x3 − x. The derivative is f ′ (x) = 3x2 − 1. This is defined everywhere and is zero at
√
√
√
√
x = ± 3/3. Looking first at x = 3/3, we see that f ( 3/3) = −2 3/9. Now we test
√
two points on either side of x = 3/3, making sure that neither is farther away than
√
√
the nearest critical value; since 3 < 3, 3/3 < 1 and we can use x = 0 and x = 1.
√
√
Since f (0) = 0 > −2 3/9 and f (1) = 0 > −2 3/9, there must be a local minimum at

108 Chapter 5 Curve Sketching
√
√
√
3/3. For x = − 3/3, we see that f (− 3/3) = 2 3/9. This time we can use x = 0
√
and x = −1, and we find that f (−1) = f (0) = 0 < 2 3/9, so there must be a local
√
maximum at x = − 3/3.
x=

√

Of course this example is made very simple by our choice of points to test, namely
x = −1, 0, 1. We could have used other values, say −5/4, 1/3, and 3/4, but this would
have made the calculations considerably more tedious.
EXAMPLE 5.1.3 Find all local maximum and minimum points for f (x) = sin x+cos x.
The derivative is f ′ (x) = cos x − sin x. This is always defined and is zero whenever
cos x = sin x. Recalling that the cos x and sin x are the x and y coordinates of points on a
unit circle, we see that cos x = sin x when x is π/4, π/4 ± π, π/4 ± 2π, π/4 ± 3π, etc. Since
both sine and cosine have a period of 2π, we need only determine the status of x = π/4
and x = 5π/4. We can use 0 and π/2 to test the critical value x = π/4. We find that
√
√
f (π/4) = 2, f (0) = 1 < 2 and f (π/2) = 1, so there is a local maximum when x = π/4
and also when x = π/4 ± 2π, π/4 ± 4π, etc. We can summarize this more neatly by saying
that there are local maxima at π/4 ± 2kπ for every integer k.
We use π and 2π to test the critical value x = 5π/4. The relevant values are f (5π/4) =
√
√
√
− 2, f (π) = −1 > − 2, f (2π) = 1 > − 2, so there is a local minimum at x = 5π/4,
5π/4 ± 2π, 5π/4 ± 4π, etc. More succinctly, there are local minima at 5π/4 ± 2kπ for every
integer k.

18. We generalize the preceding two questions. Let n be a positive integer and let f be a polynomial of degree n. How many critical points can f have? (Hint: Recall the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra, which says that a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots.)

5.2

The first derivative test

The method of the previous section for deciding whether there is a local maximum or
minimum at a critical value is not always convenient. We can instead use information
about the derivative f ′ (x) to decide; since we have already had to compute the derivative
to find the critical values, there is often relatively little extra work involved in this method.
How can the derivative tell us whether there is a maximum, minimum, or neither at
a point? Suppose that f ′ (a) = 0. If there is a local maximum when x = a, the function
must be lower near x = a than it is right at x = a. If the derivative exists near x = a, this
means f ′ (x) > 0 when x is near a and x < a, because the function must “slope up” just
to the left of a. Similarly, f ′ (x) < 0 when x is near a and x > a, because f slopes down
from the local maximum as we move to the right. Using the same reasoning, if there is
a local minimum at x = a, the derivative of f must be negative just to the left of a and
positive just to the right. If the derivative exists near a but does not change from positive
to negative or negative to positive, that is, it is positive on both sides or negative on both
sides, then there is neither a maximum nor minimum when x = a. See the first graph in
figure 5.1.1 and the graph in figure 5.1.2 for examples.
EXAMPLE 5.2.1 Find all local maximum and minimum points for f (x) = sin x + cos x
using the first derivative test. The derivative is f ′ (x) = cos x−sin x and from example 5.1.3
the critical values we need to consider are π/4 and 5π/4.
The graphs of sin x and cos x are shown in figure 5.2.1. Just to the left of π/4 the
cosine is larger than the sine, so f ′ (x) is positive; just to the right the cosine is smaller
than the sine, so f ′ (x) is negative. This means there is a local maximum at π/4. Just to
the left of 5π/4 the cosine is smaller than the sine, and to the right the cosine is larger
than the sine. This means that the derivative f ′ (x) is negative to the left and positive to
the right, so f has a local minimum at 5π/4.

Exercises 5.2.
In 1–13, find all critical points and identify them as local maximum points, local minimum points,
or neither.

5.3

The second derivative test

The basis of the first derivative test is that if the derivative changes from positive to
negative at a point at which the derivative is zero then there is a local maximum at the
point, and similarly for a local minimum. If f ′ changes from positive to negative it is
decreasing; this means that the derivative of f ′ , f ′′ , might be negative, and if in fact f ′′
is negative then f ′ is definitely decreasing, so there is a local maximum at the point in
question. Note well that f ′ might change from positive to negative while f ′′ is zero, in
which case f ′′ gives us no information about the critical value. Similarly, if f ′ changes
from negative to positive there is a local minimum at the point, and f ′ is increasing. If
f ′′ > 0 at the point, this tells us that f ′ is increasing, and so there is a local minimum.

√
√
local maximum at π/4. Since f ′′ (5π/4) = − − 2/2 − − 2/2 = 2 > 0, there is a local
minimum at 5π/4.
EXAMPLE 5.3.1

When it works, the second derivative test is often the easiest way to identify local maximum and minimum points. Sometimes the test fails, and sometimes the second derivative
is quite diﬃcult to evaluate; in such cases we must fall back on one of the previous tests.
EXAMPLE 5.3.2 Let f (x) = x4 . The derivatives are f ′ (x) = 4x3 and f ′′ (x) = 12x2 .
Zero is the only critical value, but f ′′ (0) = 0, so the second derivative test tells us nothing.
However, f (x) is positive everywhere except at zero, so clearly f (x) has a local minimum
at zero. On the other hand, f (x) = −x4 also has zero as its only critical value, and the
second derivative is again zero, but −x4 has a local maximum at zero.

18. y = sin3 x ⇒

5.4

Concavity and inflection points

We know that the sign of the derivative tells us whether a function is increasing or decreasing; for example, when f ′ (x) > 0, f (x) is increasing. The sign of the second derivative
f ′′ (x) tells us whether f ′ is increasing or decreasing; we have seen that if f ′ is zero and
increasing at a point then there is a local minimum at the point, and if f ′ is zero and
decreasing at a point then there is a local maximum at the point. Thus, we extracted
information about f from information about f ′′ .
We can get information from the sign of f ′′ even when f ′ is not zero. Suppose that
f ′′ (a) > 0. This means that near x = a, f ′ is increasing. If f ′ (a) > 0, this means that f
slopes up and is getting steeper; if f ′ (a) < 0, this means that f slopes down and is getting

less steep. The two situations are shown in figure 5.4.1. A curve that is shaped like this

Now suppose that f ′′ (a) < 0. This means that near x = a, f ′ is decreasing. If
f ′ (a) > 0, this means that f slopes up and is getting less steep; if f ′ (a) < 0, this means
that f slopes down and is getting steeper. The two situations are shown in figure 5.4.2. A
curve that is shaped like this is called concave down.

If we are trying to understand the shape of the graph of a function, knowing where
it is concave up and concave down helps us to get a more accurate picture. Of particular
interest are points at which the concavity changes from up to down or down to up; such
points are called inflection points. If the concavity changes from up to down at x = a, f ′′
changes from positive to the left of a to negative to the right of a, and usually f ′′ (a) = 0.
We can identify such points by first finding where f ′′ (x) is zero and then checking to see
whether f ′′ (x) does in fact go from positive to negative or negative to positive at these
points. Note that it is possible that f ′′ (a) = 0 but the concavity is the same on both sides;
f (x) = x4 at x = 0 is an example.
EXAMPLE 5.4.1 Describe the concavity of f (x) = x3 −x. f ′ (x) = 3x2 −1, f ′′ (x) = 6x.
Since f ′′ (0) = 0, there is potentially an inflection point at zero. Since f ′′ (x) > 0 when
x > 0 and f ′′ (x) < 0 when x < 0 the concavity does change from down to up at zero, and
the curve is concave down for all x < 0 and concave up for all x > 0.
Note that we need to compute and analyze the second derivative to understand concavity, so we may as well try to use the second derivative test for maxima and minima. If
for some reason this fails we can then try one of the other tests.

5.5

Asymptotes and Other Things to Look For

A vertical asymptote is a place where the function becomes infinite, typically because
the formula for the function has a denominator that becomes zero. For example, the
reciprocal function f (x) = 1/x has a vertical asymptote at x = 0, and the function tan x
has a vertical asymptote at x = π/2 (and also at x = −π/2, x = 3π/2, etc.). Whenever the
formula for a function contains a denominator it is worth looking for a vertical asymptote
by checking to see if the denominator can ever be zero, and then checking the limit at such
points. Note that there is not always a vertical asymptote where the denominator is zero:
f (x) = (sin x)/x has a zero denominator at x = 0, but since lim (sin x)/x = 1 there is no
x→0

asymptote there.
A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line to which f (x) gets closer and closer as x
approaches ∞ (or as x approaches −∞). For example, the reciprocal function has the
x-axis for a horizontal asymptote. Horizontal asymptotes can be identified by computing
the limits lim f (x) and lim f (x). Since lim 1/x = lim 1/x = 0, the line y = 0 (that
x→∞

x→−∞

x→∞

x→−∞

is, the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote in both directions.

114 Chapter 5 Curve Sketching
Some functions have asymptotes that are neither horizontal nor vertical, but some
other line. Such asymptotes are somewhat more diﬃcult to identify and we will ignore
them.
If the domain of the function does not extend out to infinity, we should also ask
what happens as x approaches the boundary of the domain. For example, the function
√
y = f (x) = 1/ r2 − x2 has domain −r < x < r, and y becomes infinite as x approaches
either r or −r. In this case we might also identify this behavior because when x = ±r the
denominator of the function is zero.
If there are any points where the derivative fails to exist (a cusp or corner), then we
should take special note of what the function does at such a point.
Finally, it is worthwhile to notice any symmetry. A function f (x) that has the same
value for −x as for x, i.e., f (−x) = f (x), is called an “even function.” Its graph is
symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Some examples of even functions are: xn when n
is an even number, cos x, and sin2 x. On the other hand, a function that satisfies the
property f (−x) = −f (x) is called an “odd function.” Its graph is symmetric with respect
to the origin. Some examples of odd functions are: xn when n is an odd number, sin x, and
tan x. Of course, most functions are neither even nor odd, and do not have any particular
symmetry.

Optimization

Many important applied problems involve finding the best way to accomplish some task.
Often this involves finding the maximum or minimum value of some function: the minimum
time to make a certain journey, the minimum cost for doing a task, the maximum power
that can be generated by a device, and so on. Many of these problems can be solved by
finding the appropriate function and then using techniques of calculus to find the maximum
or the minimum value required.
Generally such a problem will have the following mathematical form: Find the largest
(or smallest) value of f (x) when a ≤ x ≤ b. Sometimes a or b are infinite, but frequently
the real world imposes some constraint on the values that x may have.
Such a problem diﬀers in two ways from the local maximum and minimum problems
we encountered when graphing functions: We are interested only in the function between
a and b, and we want to know the largest or smallest value that f (x) takes on, not merely
values that are the largest or smallest in a small interval. That is, we seek not a local
maximum or minimum but a global maximum or minimum, sometimes also called an
absolute maximum or minimum.
Any global maximum or minimum must of course be a local maximum or minimum.
If we find all possible local extrema, then the global maximum, if it exists, must be the
largest of the local maxima and the global minimum, if it exists, must be the smallest of
the local minima. We already know where local extrema can occur: only at those points
at which f ′ (x) is zero or undefined. Actually, there are two additional points at which a
maximum or minimum can occur if the endpoints a and b are not infinite, namely, at a

The function f (x) = x2 restricted to [−2, 1]

and b. We have not previously considered such points because we have not been interested
in limiting a function to a small interval. An example should make this clear.
EXAMPLE 6.1.1 Find the maximum and minimum values of f (x) = x2 on the interval
[−2, 1], shown in figure 6.1.1. We compute f ′ (x) = 2x, which is zero at x = 0 and is always
defined.
Since f ′ (1) = 2 we would not normally flag x = 1 as a point of interest, but it is clear
from the graph that when f (x) is restricted to [−2, 1] there is a local maximum at x = 1.
Likewise we would not normally pay attention to x = −2, but since we have truncated f
at −2 we have introduced a new local maximum there as well. In a technical sense nothing
new is going on here: When we truncate f we actually create a new function, let’s call it
g, that is defined only on the interval [−2, 1]. If we try to compute the derivative of this
new function we actually find that it does not have a derivative at −2 or 1. Why? Because
to compute the derivative at 1 we must compute the limit
g(1 + ∆x) − g(1)
.
∆x→0
∆x
lim

This limit does not exist because when ∆x > 0, g(1 + ∆x) is not defined. It is simpler,
however, simply to remember that we must always check the endpoints.
So the function g, that is, f restricted to [−2, 1], has one critical value and two finite
endpoints, any of which might be the global maximum or minimum. We could first determine which of these are local maximum or minimum points (or neither); then the largest
local maximum must be the global maximum and the smallest local minimum must be the
global minimum. It is usually easier, however, to compute the value of f at every point
at which the global maximum or minimum might occur; the largest of these is the global
maximum, the smallest is the global minimum.
So we compute f (−2) = 4, f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1. The global maximum is 4 at x = −2
and the global minimum is 0 at x = 0.

It is possible that there is no global maximum or minimum. It is diﬃcult, and not
particularly useful, to express a complete procedure for determining whether this is the
case. Generally, the best approach is to gain enough understanding of the shape of the
graph to decide. Fortunately, only a rough idea of the shape is usually needed.
There are some particularly nice cases that are easy. A continuous function on a closed
interval [a, b] always has both a global maximum and a global minimum, so examining the
critical values and the endpoints is enough:
THEOREM 6.1.2 Extreme value theorem If f is continuous on a closed interval
[a, b], then it has both a minimum and a maximum point. That is, there are real numbers
c and d in [a, b] so that for every x in [a, b], f (x) ≤ f (c) and f (x) ≥ f (d).
Another easy case: If a function is continuous and has a single critical value, then if
there is a local maximum at the critical value it is a global maximum, and if it is a local
minimum it is a global minimum. There may also be a global minimum in the first case,
or a global maximum in the second case, but that will generally require more eﬀort to
determine.
EXAMPLE 6.1.3 Let f (x) = −x2 + 4x − 3. Find the maximum value of f (x) on the
interval [0, 4]. First note that f ′ (x) = −2x+4 = 0 when x = 2, and f (2) = 1. Next observe
that f ′ (x) is defined for all x, so there are no other critical values. Finally, f (0) = −3 and
f (4) = −3. The largest value of f (x) on the interval [0, 4] is f (2) = 1.
EXAMPLE 6.1.4 Let f (x) = −x2 + 4x − 3. Find the maximum value of f (x) on the
interval [−1, 1].
First note that f ′ (x) = −2x + 4 = 0 when x = 2. But x = 2 is not in the interval, so
we don’t use it. Thus the only two points to be checked are the endpoints; f (−1) = −8
and f (1) = 0. So the largest value of f (x) on [−1, 1] is f (1) = 0.
EXAMPLE 6.1.5 Find the maximum and minimum values of the function f (x) =
7 + |x − 2| for x between 1 and 4 inclusive. The derivative f ′ (x) is never zero, but f ′ (x) is
undefined at x = 2, so we compute f (2) = 7. Checking the end points we get f (1) = 8 and
f (4) = 9. The smallest of these numbers is f (2) = 7, which is, therefore, the minimum
value of f (x) on the interval 1 ≤ x ≤ 4, and the maximum is f (4) = 9.
EXAMPLE 6.1.6 Find all local maxima and minima for f (x) = x3 − x, and determine whether there is a global maximum or minimum on the open interval (−2, 2). In
√
√
example 5.1.2 we found a local maximum at (− 3/3, 2 3/9) and a local minimum at

sidered. Is the lone local maximum a global maximum? Here we must look more closely at
√
√
the graph. We know that on the closed interval [− 3/3, 3/3] there is a global maximum
√
√
at x = − 3/3 and a global minimum at x = 3/3. So the question becomes: what hap√
√
pens between −2 and − 3/3, and between 3/3 and 2? Since there is a local minimum
√
at x = 3/3, the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical
√
√
values. This means no value of f will be less than −2 3/9 between 3/3 and 2, but it
√
says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum 2 3/9.
√
How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of 3/3, we need to know what
the function values do “close to” 2. Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a
√
computation to get some idea of what’s going on. Since f (1.9) = 4.959 > 2 3/9, there
√
is no global maximum at − 3/3, and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell
√
that 4.959 > 2 3/9? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is
√
not even close to 4.959 we can take this as decisive. Since 2 3/9 ≈ 0.3849, there’s really
no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators,
however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close.
√
√
In this case we can convert the relation 4.959 > 2 3/9 into (9/2)4.959 > 3 and ask
whether this is true. Since the left side is clearly larger than 4 · 4 which is clearly larger
√
than 3, this settles the question.)
A similar analysis shows that there is also no global minimum. The graph of f (x) on
(−2, 2) is shown in figure 6.1.2.
EXAMPLE 6.1.7 Of all rectangles of area 100, which has the smallest perimeter?
First we must translate this into a purely mathematical problem in which we want to
find the minimum value of a function. If x denotes one of the sides of the rectangle, then
the adjacent side must be 100/x (in order that the area be 100). So the function we want

6.1

Optimization

121

to minimize is
f (x) = 2x + 2

100
x

since the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width of the rectangle. Not all values
of x make sense in this problem: lengths of sides of rectangles must be positive, so x > 0.
If x > 0 then so is 100/x, so we need no second condition on x.
We next find f ′ (x) and set it equal to zero: 0 = f ′ (x) = 2 − 200/x2 . Solving f ′ (x) = 0
for x gives us x = ±10. We are interested only in x > 0, so only the value x = 10 is of
interest. Since f ′ (x) is defined everywhere on the interval (0, ∞), there are no more critical
values, and there are no endpoints. Is there a local maximum, minimum, or neither at
x = 10? The second derivative is f ′′ (x) = 400/x3 , and f ′′ (10) > 0, so there is a local
minimum. Since there is only one critical value, this is also the global minimum, so the
rectangle with smallest perimeter is the 10 × 10 square.
EXAMPLE 6.1.8 You want to sell a certain number n of items in order to maximize
your profit. Market research tells you that if you set the price at $1.50, you will be able
to sell 5000 items, and for every 10 cents you lower the price below $1.50 you will be able
to sell another 1000 items. Suppose that your fixed costs (“start-up costs”) total $2000,
and the per item cost of production (“marginal cost”) is $0.50. Find the price to set per
item and the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also determine the
maximum profit you can get.
The first step is to convert the problem into a function maximization problem. Since
we want to maximize profit by setting the price per item, we should look for a function
P (x) representing the profit when the price per item is x. Profit is revenue minus costs, and
revenue is number of items sold times the price per item, so we get P = nx − 2000 − 0.50n.
The number of items sold is itself a function of x, n = 5000 + 1000(1.5 − x)/0.10, because
(1.5 − x)/0.10 is the number of multiples of 10 cents that the price is below $1.50. Now
we substitute for n in the profit function:
P (x) = (5000 + 1000(1.5 − x)/0.10)x − 2000 − 0.5(5000 + 1000(1.5 − x)/0.10)
= −10000x2 + 25000x − 12000
We want to know the maximum value of this function when x is between 0 and 1.5. The
derivative is P ′ (x) = −20000x + 25000, which is zero when x = 1.25. Since P ′′ (x) =
−20000 < 0, there must be a local maximum at x = 1.25, and since this is the only critical
value it must be a global maximum as well. (Alternately, we could compute P (0) =
−12000, P (1.25) = 3625, and P (1.5) = 3000 and note that P (1.25) is the maximum of
these.) Thus the maximum profit is $3625, attained when we set the price at $1.25 and
sell 7500 items.

Rectangle in a parabola.

EXAMPLE 6.1.9 Find the largest rectangle (that is, the rectangle with largest area)
that fits inside the graph of the parabola y = x2 below the line y = a (a is an unspecified
constant value), with the top side of the rectangle on the horizontal line y = a; see
figure 6.1.3.)
We want to find the maximum value of some function A(x) representing area. Perhaps
the hardest part of this problem is deciding what x should represent. The lower right
corner of the rectangle is at (x, x2 ), and once this is chosen the rectangle is completely
determined. So we can let the x in A(x) be the x of the parabola f (x) = x2 . Then the
area is A(x) = (2x)(a − x2 ) = −2x3 + 2ax. We want the maximum value of A(x) when x is
√
√
in [0, a]. (You might object to allowing x = 0 or x = a, since then the “rectangle” has
either no width or no height, so is not “really” a rectangle. But the problem is somewhat
easier if we simply allow such rectangles, which have zero area.)
√
Setting 0 = A′ (x) = −6x2 + 2a we get x = a/3 as the only critical value. Testing
√
√
√
this and the two endpoints, we have A(0) = A( a) = 0 and A( a/3) = (4/9) 3a3/2 .
√
The maximum area thus occurs when the rectangle has dimensions 2 a/3 × (2/3)a.
EXAMPLE 6.1.10 If you fit the largest possible cone inside a sphere, what fraction
of the volume of the sphere is occupied by the cone? (Here by “cone” we mean a right
circular cone, i.e., a cone for which the base is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry, and
for which the cross-section cut perpendicular to the axis of symmetry at any point is a
circle.)
Let R be the radius of the sphere, and let r and h be the base radius and height of
the cone inside the sphere. What we want to maximize is the volume of the cone: πr2 h/3.
Here R is a fixed value, but r and h can vary. Namely, we could choose r to be as large as
possible—equal to R—by taking the height equal to R; or we could make the cone’s height
h larger at the expense of making r a little less than R. See the cross-section depicted in

Cone in a sphere.

figure 6.1.4. We have situated the picture in a convenient way relative to the x and y axes,
namely, with the center of the sphere at the origin and the vertex of the cone at the far
left on the x-axis.
Notice that the function we want to maximize, πr2 h/3, depends on two variables. This
is frequently the case, but often the two variables are related in some way so that “really”
there is only one variable. So our next step is to find the relationship and use it to solve
for one of the variables in terms of the other, so as to have a function of only one variable
to maximize. In this problem, the condition is apparent in the figure: the upper corner of
the triangle, whose coordinates are (h − R, r), must be on the circle of radius R. That is,
(h − R)2 + r2 = R2 .
We can solve for h in terms of r or for r in terms of h. Either involves taking a square
root, but we notice that the volume function contains r2 , not r by itself, so it is easiest to
solve for r2 directly: r2 = R2 − (h − R)2 . Then we substitute the result into πr2 h/3:
V (h) = π(R2 − (h − R)2 )h/3
π

= − h3 + πh2 R

We want to maximize V (h) when h is between 0 and 2R. Now we solve 0 = f ′ (h) =
−πh2 + (4/3)πhR, getting h = 0 or h = 4R/3. We compute V (0) = V (2R) = 0 and
V (4R/3) = (32/81)πR3 . The maximum is the latter; since the volume of the sphere is
(4/3)πR3 , the fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is

EXAMPLE 6.1.11 You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume.
Suppose that the top and bottom are made of a material that is N times as expensive
(cost per unit area) as the material used for the lateral side of the cylinder. Find (in terms
of N ) the ratio of height to base radius of the cylinder that minimizes the cost of making
the containers.
Let us first choose letters to represent various things: h for the height, r for the base
radius, V for the volume of the cylinder, and c for the cost per unit area of the lateral side
of the cylinder; V and c are constants, h and r are variables. Now we can write the cost
of materials:
c(2πrh) + N c(2πr2 ).
Again we have two variables; the relationship is provided by the fixed volume of the
cylinder: V = πr2 h. We use this relationship to eliminate h (we could eliminate r, but it’s
a little easier if we eliminate h, which appears in only one place in the above formula for
cost). The result is
f (r) = 2cπr

V

We want to know the minimum value of this function when r is in (0, ∞). We now set
√
0 = f ′ (r) = −2cV /r2 + 4N cπr, giving r = 3 V /(2N π). Since f ′′ (r) = 4cV /r3 + 4N cπ
is positive when r is positive, there is a local minimum at the critical value, and hence a
global minimum since there is only one critical value.
Finally, since h = V /(πr2 ),
h

so the minimum cost occurs when the height h is 2N times the radius. If, for example,
there is no diﬀerence in the cost of materials, the height is twice the radius (or the height
is equal to the diameter).

EXAMPLE 6.1.12 Suppose you want to reach a point A that is located across the
sand from a nearby road (see figure 6.1.5). Suppose that the road is straight, and b is the
distance from A to the closest point C on the road. Let v be your speed on the road, and
let w, which is less than v, be your speed on the sand. Right now you are at the point
D, which is a distance a from C. At what point B should you turn oﬀ the road and head
across the sand in order to minimize your travel time to A?
Let x be the distance short of C where you turn oﬀ, i.e., the distance from B to C. We
want to minimize the total travel time. Recall that when traveling at constant velocity,
time is distance divided by velocity.
You travel the distance DB at speed v, and then the distance BA at speed w. Since

DB = a − x and, by the Pythagorean theorem, BA = x2 + b2 , the total time for the
trip is

We want to find the minimum value of f when x is between 0 and a. As usual we set
f ′ (x) = 0 and solve for x:

Notice that a does not appear in the last expression, but a is not irrelevant, since we

are interested only in critical values that are in [0, a], and wb/ v 2 − w2 is either in this
interval or not. If it is, we can use the second derivative to test it:
f ′′ (x) =

b2
.
(x2 + b2 )3/2 w

Since this is always positive there is a local minimum at the critical point, and so it is a
global minimum as well.
If the critical value is not in [0, a] it is larger than a. In this case the minimum must
occur at one of the endpoints. We can compute

but it is diﬃcult to determine which of these is smaller by direct comparison. If, as is
likely in practice, we know the values of v, w, a, and b, then it is easy to determine this.
With a little cleverness, however, we can determine the minimum in general. We have seen
that f ′′ (x) is always positive, so the derivative f ′ (x) is always increasing. We know that
√
at wb/ v 2 − w2 the derivative is zero, so for values of x less than that critical value, the
derivative is negative. This means that f (0) > f (a), so the minimum occurs when x = a.

So the upshot is this: If you start farther away from C than wb/ v 2 − w2 then you

always want to cut across the sand when you are a distance wb/ v 2 − w2 from point C.
If you start closer than this to C, you should cut directly across the sand.

and the distance along the side of the pool between the closest point to you and the closest
point to the child is c (see the figure below). Without stopping to do any calculus, you
instinctively choose the quickest route (shown in the figure) and save the child. Our purpose
is to derive a relation between the angle θ1 your path makes with the perpendicular to the side
of the pool when you’re on land, and the angle θ2 your path makes with the perpendicular
when you’re in the water. To do this, let x be the distance between the closest point to you
at the side of the pool and the point where you enter the water. Write the total time you
run (on land and in the water) in terms of x (and also the constants a, b, c, v1 , v2 ). Then set
the derivative equal to zero. The result, called “Snell’s law” or the “law of refraction,” also
governs the bending of light when it goes into water. ⇒

Suppose we have two variables x and y (in most problems the letters will be diﬀerent,
but for now let’s use x and y) which are both changing with time. A “related rates”
problem is a problem in which we know one of the rates of change at a given instant—say,

130 Chapter 6 Applications of the Derivative
ẋ = dx/dt—and we want to find the other rate ẏ = dy/dt at that instant. (The use of
ẋ to mean dx/dt goes back to Newton and is still used for this purpose, especially by
physicists.)
If y is written in terms of x, i.e., y = f (x), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:
ẏ =

dy
dy dx
dy
=
·
=
ẋ.
dt
dx dt
dx

That is, find the derivative of f (x), plug in the value of x at the instant in question, and
multiply by the given value of ẋ = dx/dt to get ẏ = dy/dt.
EXAMPLE 6.2.1 Suppose an object is moving along a path described by y = x2 , that
is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say t = 5, the x coordinate is
6 and we measure the speed at which the x coordinate of the object is changing and find
that dx/dt = 3. At the same time, how fast is the y coordinate changing?
Using the chain rule, dy/dt = 2x · dx/dt. At t = 5 we know that x = 6 and dx/dt = 3,
so dy/dt = 2 · 6 · 3 = 36.
In many cases, particularly interesting ones, x and y will be related in some other way,
for example x = f (y), or F (x, y) = k, or perhaps F (x, y) = G(x, y), where F (x, y) and
G(x, y) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related
rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values
(namely, x, y, and ẋ), and then solving for ẏ.
To summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:
1. Decide what the two variables are.
2. Find an equation relating them.
3. Take d/dt of both sides.
4. Plug in all known values at the instant in question.
5. Solve for the unknown rate.
EXAMPLE 6.2.2 A plane is flying directly away from you at 500 mph at an altitude
of 3 miles. How fast is the plane’s distance from you increasing at the moment when the
plane is flying over a point on the ground 4 miles from you?
To see what’s going on, we first draw a schematic representation of the situation, as
in figure 6.2.1.
Because the plane is in level flight directly away from you, the rate at which x changes
is the speed of the plane, dx/dt = 500. The distance between you and the plane is y; it
is dy/dt that we wish to know. By the Pythagorean Theorem we know that x2 + 9 = y 2 .

Taking the derivative:
2xẋ = 2y ẏ.
We are interested in the time at which x = 4; at this time we know that 42 + 9 = y 2 , so
y = 5. Putting together all the information we get
2(4)(500) = 2(5)ẏ.
Thus, ẏ = 400 mph.
EXAMPLE 6.2.3 You are inflating a spherical balloon at the rate of 7 cm3 /sec. How
fast is its radius increasing when the radius is 4 cm?
Here the variables are the radius r and the volume V . We know dV /dt, and we want
dr/dt. The two variables are related by means of the equation V = 4πr3 /3. Taking the
derivative of both sides gives dV /dt = 4πr2 ṙ. We now substitute the values we know at
the instant in question: 7 = 4π42 ṙ, so ṙ = 7/(64π) cm/sec.
EXAMPLE 6.2.4 Water is poured into a conical container at the rate of 10 cm3 /sec.
The cone points directly down, and it has a height of 30 cm and a base radius of 10 cm; see
figure 6.2.2. How fast is the water level rising when the water is 4 cm deep (at its deepest
point)?
The water forms a conical shape within the big cone; its height and base radius and
volume are all increasing as water is poured into the container. This means that we actually
have three things varying with time: the water level h (the height of the cone of water),
the radius r of the circular top surface of water (the base radius of the cone of water), and
the volume of water V . The volume of a cone is given by V = πr2 h/3. We know dV /dt,
and we want dh/dt. At first something seems to be wrong: we have a third variable r
whose rate we don’t know.
But the dimensions of the cone of water must have the same proportions as those of
the container. That is, because of similar triangles, r/h = 10/30 so r = h/3. Now we can
eliminate r from the problem entirely: V = π(h/3)2 h/3 = πh3 /27. We take the derivative
of both sides and plug in h = 4 and dV /dt = 10, obtaining 10 = (3π · 42 /27)(dh/dt). Thus,
dh/dt = 90/(16π) cm/sec.

EXAMPLE 6.2.5 A swing consists of a board at the end of a 10 ft long rope. Think
of the board as a point P at the end of the rope, and let Q be the point of attachment
at the other end. Suppose that the swing is directly below Q at time t = 0, and is being
pushed by someone who walks at 6 ft/sec from left to right. Find (a) how fast the swing
is rising after 1 sec; (b) the angular speed of the rope in deg/sec after 1 sec.
We start out by asking: What is the geometric quantity whose rate of change we know,
and what is the geometric quantity whose rate of change we’re being asked about? Note
that the person pushing the swing is moving horizontally at a rate we know. In other
words, the horizontal coordinate of P is increasing at 6 ft/sec. In the xy-plane let us
make the convenient choice of putting the origin at the location of P at time t = 0, i.e., a
distance 10 directly below the point of attachment. Then the rate we know is dx/dt, and
in part (a) the rate we want is dy/dt (the rate at which P is rising). In part (b) the rate
we want is θ̇ = dθ/dt, where θ stands for the angle in radians through which the swing has
swung from the vertical. (Actually, since we want our answer in deg/sec, at the end we
must convert dθ/dt from rad/sec by multiplying by 180/π.)
(a) From the diagram we see that we have a right triangle whose legs are x and 10 − y,
and whose hypotenuse is 10. Hence x2 + (10 − y)2 = 100. Taking the derivative of both
sides we obtain: 2xẋ + 2(10 − y)(0 − ẏ) = 0. We now look at what we know after 1 second,
namely x = 6 (because x started at 0 and has been increasing at the rate of 6 ft/sec
for 1 sec), y = 2 (because we get 10 − y = 8 from the Pythagorean theorem applied to
the triangle with hypotenuse 10 and leg 6), and ẋ = 6. Putting in these values gives us
2 · 6 · 6 − 2 · 8ẏ = 0, from which we can easily solve for ẏ: ẏ = 4.5 ft/sec.
(b) Here our two variables are x and θ, so we want to use the same right triangle as
in part (a), but this time relate θ to x. Since the hypotenuse is constant (equal to 10),
the best way to do this is to use the sine: sin θ = x/10. Taking derivatives we obtain

(cos θ)θ̇ = 0.1ẋ. At the instant in question (t = 1 sec), when we have a right triangle with
sides 6–8–10, cos θ = 8/10 and ẋ = 6. Thus (8/10)θ̇ = 6/10, i.e., θ̇ = 6/8 = 3/4 rad/sec,
or approximately 43 deg/sec.
We have seen that sometimes there are apparently more than two variables that change
with time, but in reality there are just two, as the others can be expressed in terms of
just two. But sometimes there really are several variables that change with time; as long
as you know the rates of change of all but one of them you can find the rate of change of
the remaining one. As in the case when there are just two variables, take the derivative
of both sides of the equation relating all of the variables, and then substitute all of the
known values and solve for the unknown rate.

Notice how this problem diﬀers from example 6.2.2. In both cases we started with the
Pythagorean Theorem and took derivatives on both sides. However, in example 6.2.2 one
of the sides was a constant (the altitude of the plane), and so the derivative of the square
of that side of the triangle was simply zero. In this example, on the other hand, all three
sides of the right triangle are variables, even though we are interested in a specific value
of each side of the triangle (namely, when the sides have lengths 10 and 15). Make sure
that you understand at the start of the problem what are the variables and what are the
constants.

dimensions 10 ft × 1 ft, and then attaching the construction to a wooden wall at each end.
The angle θ was originally 30◦ , but because of poor construction the sides are collapsing.
The trough is full of water. At what rate (in ft3 /sec) is the water spilling out over the top
of the trough if the sides have each fallen to an angle of 45◦ , and are collapsing at the rate
of 1◦ per second? ⇒

Newton's Method

Suppose you have a function f (x), and you want to find as accurately as possible where
it crosses the x-axis; in other words, you want to solve f (x) = 0. Suppose you know of
no way to find an exact solution by any algebraic procedure, but you are able to use an
approximation, provided it can be made quite close to the true value. Newton’s method is
a way to find a solution to the equation to as many decimal places as you want. It is what

138 Chapter 6 Applications of the Derivative
is called an “iterative procedure,” meaning that it can be repeated again and again to
get an answer of greater and greater accuracy. Iterative procedures like Newton’s method
are well suited to programming for a computer. Newton’s method uses the fact that the
tangent line to a curve is a good approximation to the curve near the point of tangency.
√
√
EXAMPLE 6.3.1 Approximate 3. Since 3 is a solution to x2 = 3 or x2 − 3 = 0, we
use f (x) = x2 − 3. We start by guessing something reasonably close to the true value; this
√
is usually easy to do; let’s use 3 ≈ 2. Now use the tangent line to the curve when x = 2
as an approximation to the curve, as shown in figure 6.3.1. Since f ′ (x) = 2x, the slope of
this tangent line is 4 and its equation is y = 4x − 7. The tangent line is quite close to f (x),
√
so it crosses the x-axis near the point at which f (x) crosses, that is, near 3. It is easy
to find where the tangent line crosses the x-axis: solve 0 = 4x − 7 to get x = 7/4 = 1.75.
This is certainly a better approximation than 2, but let us say not close enough. We can
improve it by doing the same thing again: find the tangent line at x = 1.75, find where
this new tangent line crosses the x-axis, and use that value as a better approximation. We
can continue this indefinitely, though it gets a bit tedious. Lets see if we can shortcut the
process. Suppose the best approximation to the intercept we have so far is xi . To find
a better approximation we will always do the same thing: find the slope of the tangent
line at xi , find the equation of the tangent line, find the x-intercept. The slope is 2xi .
The tangent line is y = (2xi )(x − xi ) + (x2i − 3), using the point-slope formula for a line.
Finally, the intercept is found by solving 0 = (2xi )(x − xi ) + (x2i − 3). With a little algebra
this turns into x = (x2i + 3)/(2xi ); this is the next approximation, which we naturally call
xi+1 . Instead of doing the whole tangent line computation every time we can simply use
this formula to get as many approximations as we want. Starting with x0 = 2, we get
x1 = (x20 + 3)/(2x0 ) = (22 + 3)/4 = 7/4 (the same approximation we got above, of course),
x2 = (x21 + 3)/(2x1 ) = ((7/4)2 + 3)/(7/2) = 97/56 ≈ 1.73214, x3 ≈ 1.73205, and so on.
This is still a bit tedious by hand, but with a calculator or, even better, a good computer
program, it is quite easy to get many, many approximations. We might guess already that
1.73205 is accurate to two decimal places, and in fact it turns out that it is accurate to 5
places.
Let’s think about this process in more general terms. We want to approximate a
solution to f (x) = 0. We start with a rough guess, which we call x0 . We use the tangent
line to f (x) to get a new approximation that we hope will be closer to the true value.
What is the equation of the tangent line when x = x0 ? The slope is f ′ (x0 ) and the line
goes through (x0 , f (x0 )), so the equation of the line is
y = f ′ (x0 )(x − x0 ) + f (x0 ).

Now we find where this crosses the x-axis by substituting y = 0 and solving for x:
x=

f (x0 )
x0 f ′ (x0 ) − f (x0 )
= x0 − ′
.
′
f (x0 )
f (x0 )

We will typically want to compute more than one of these improved approximations, so
we number them consecutively; from x0 we have computed x1 :
x1 =

f (x0 )
x0 f ′ (x0 ) − f (x0 )
= x0 − ′
,
′
f (x0 )
f (x0 )

and in general from xi we compute xi+1 :
xi+1 =

xi f ′ (xi ) − f (xi )
f (xi )
= xi − ′
.
′
f (xi )
f (xi )

EXAMPLE 6.3.2 Returning to the previous example, f (x) = x2 − 3, f ′ (x) = 2x, and
the formula becomes xi+1 = xi − (x2i − 3)/(2xi ) = (x2i + 3)/(2xi ), as before.
In practice, which is to say, if you need to approximate a value in the course of
designing a bridge or a building or an airframe, you will need to have some confidence that
the approximation you settle on is accurate enough. As a rule of thumb, once a certain
number of decimal places stop changing from one approximation to the next it is likely
that those decimal places are correct. Still, this may not be enough assurance, in which
case we can test the result for accuracy.
EXAMPLE 6.3.3 Find the x coordinate of the intersection of the curves y = 2x and
y = tan x, accurate to three decimal places. To put this in the context of Newton’s method,

140 Chapter 6 Applications of the Derivative
we note that we want to know where 2x = tan x or f (x) = tan x − 2x = 0. We compute
f ′ (x) = sec2 x − 2 and set up the formula:
xi+1 = xi −

tan xi − 2xi
.
sec2 xi − 2

From the graph in figure 6.3.2 we guess x0 = 1 as a starting point, then using the formula
we compute x1 = 1.310478030, x2 = 1.223929096, x3 = 1.176050900, x4 = 1.165926508,
x5 = 1.165561636. So we guess that the first three places are correct, but that is not
the same as saying 1.165 is correct to three decimal places—1.166 might be the correct,
rounded approximation. How can we tell? We can substitute 1.165, 1.1655 and 1.166 into
tan x − 2x; this gives −0.002483652, −0.000271247, 0.001948654. Since the first two are
negative and the third is positive, tan x − 2x crosses the x axis between 1.1655 and 1.166,
so the correct value to three places is 1.166.

Linear Approximations

Linear Approximations

Newton’s method is one example of the usefulness of the tangent line as an approximation
to a curve. Here we explore another such application.
Recall that the tangent line to f (x) at a point x = a is given by L(x) = f ′ (a)(x − a) +
f (a). The tangent line in this context is also called the linear approximation to f at a.
If f is diﬀerentiable at a then L is a good approximation of f so long as x is “not too
far” from a. Put another way, if f is diﬀerentiable at a then under a microscope f will
look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to y = x2 at three
diﬀerent magnifications.
If we want to approximate f (b), because computing it exactly is diﬃcult, we can
approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the
tangent line at some a close to b.

Figure 6.4.1

The linear approximation to y = x2 .

√
√
EXAMPLE 6.4.1 Let f (x) = x + 4. Then f ′ (x) = 1/(2 x + 4). The linear ap√
√
proximation to f at x = 5 is L(x) = 1/(2 5 + 4)(x − 5) + 5 + 4 = (x − 5)/6 + 3. As
an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand.
√
To estimate 10, we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into f (x), so
√
6 + 4 ≈ (6 − 5)/6 + 3 = 19/6 ≈ 3.16. This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is
actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place.
This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many
calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough.
With modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use
linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit
numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used
as a “reality check” on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving

142 Chapter 6 Applications of the Derivative
functions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise intractable calculation possible,
without serious loss of accuracy.
EXAMPLE 6.4.2 Consider the trigonometric function sin x. Its linear approximation
at x = 0 is simply L(x) = x. When x is small this is quite a good approximation and is
used frequently by engineers and scientists to simplify some calculations.
DEFINITION 6.4.3 Let y = f (x) be a diﬀerentiable function. We define a new
independent variable dx, and a new dependent variable dy = f ′ (x) dx. Notice that dy is a
function both of x (since f ′ (x) is a function of x) and of dx. We say that dx and dy are
diﬀerentials.
Let ∆x = x − a and ∆y = f (x) − f (a). If x is near a then ∆x is small. If we set
dx = ∆x then
∆y
∆x = ∆y.
dy = f ′ (a) dx ≈
∆x
Thus, dy can be used to approximate ∆y, the actual change in the function f between a
and x. This is exactly the approximation given by the tangent line:
dy = f ′ (a)(x − a) = f ′ (a)(x − a) + f (a) − f (a) = L(x) − f (a).
While L(x) approximates f (x), dy approximates how f (x) has changed from f (a). Figure 6.4.2 illustrates the relationships.

The Mean Value Theorem

Here are two interesting questions involving derivatives:
1. Suppose two diﬀerent functions have the same derivative; what can you say about
the relationship between the two functions?
2. Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to another toll booth at
an average speed of 70 miles per hour. What can be concluded about your actual
speed during the trip? In particular, did you exceed the 65 mile per hour speed
limit?
While these sound very diﬀerent, it turns out that the two problems are very closely
related. We know that “speed” is really the derivative by a diﬀerent name; let’s start by
translating the second question into something that may be easier to visualize. Suppose
that the function f (t) gives the position of your car on the toll road at time t. Your change
in position between one toll booth and the next is given by f (t1 ) − f (t0 ), assuming that
at time t0 you were at the first booth and at time t1 you arrived at the second booth.
Your average speed for the trip is (f (t1 ) − f (t0 ))/(t1 − t0 ). If we think about the graph
of f (t), the average speed is the slope of the line that connects the two points (t0 , f (t0 ))
and (t1 , f (t1 )). Your speed at any particular time t between t0 and t1 is f ′ (t), the slope
of the curve. Now question (2) becomes a question about slope. In particular, if the slope
between endpoints is 70, what can be said of the slopes at points between the endpoints?
As a general rule, when faced with a new problem it is often a good idea to examine
one or more simplified versions of the problem, in the hope that this will lead to an
understanding of the original problem. In this case, the problem in its “slope” form is
somewhat easier to simplify than the original, but equivalent, problem.
Here is a special instance of the problem. Suppose that f (t0 ) = f (t1 ). Then the
two endpoints have the same height and the slope of the line connecting the endpoints
is zero. What can we say about the slope between the endpoints? It shouldn’t take
much experimentation before you are convinced of the truth of this statement: Somewhere

144 Chapter 6 Applications of the Derivative
between t0 and t1 the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between t0 and t1 the slope
is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same
is true even if the endpoints are at diﬀerent heights, and again a bit of experimentation will
probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than “experimentation”—we
can prove that this is so.
We start with the simplified version:
THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle’s Theorem
Suppose that f (x) has a derivative on the
interval (a, b), is continuous on the interval [a, b], and f (a) = f (b). Then at some value
c ∈ (a, b), f ′ (c) = 0.
Proof. We know that f (x) has a maximum and minimum value on [a, b] (because it
is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an
endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is
undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.
If the maximum or minimum occurs at a point c, other than an endpoint, where
′
f (c) = 0, then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum
both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum
and minimum are the same. This means that f (x) = f (a) = f (b) at every x ∈ [a, b], so
the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in (a, b). Then we
may choose any c at all to get f ′ (c) = 0.
Perhaps remarkably, this special case is all we need to prove the more general one as
well.
Suppose that f (x) has a derivative on
THEOREM 6.5.2 Mean Value Theorem
the interval (a, b) and is continuous on the interval [a, b]. Then at some value c ∈ (a, b),
f (b) − f (a)
f ′ (c) =
.
b−a
f (b) − f (a)
, and consider a new function g(x) = f (x)−m(x−a)−f (a).
b−a
We know that g(x) has a derivative everywhere, since g ′ (x) = f ′ (x) − m. We can compute
g(a) = f (a) − m(a − a) − f (a) = 0 and

Proof.

Let m =

g(b) = f (b) − m(b − a) − f (a) = f (b) −

f (b) − f (a)
(b − a) − f (a)
b−a

= f (b) − (f (b) − f (a)) − f (a) = 0.

6.5

The Mean Value Theorem

145

So the height of g(x) is the same at both endpoints. This means, by Rolle’s Theorem, that
at some c, g ′ (c) = 0. But we know that g ′ (c) = f ′ (c) − m, so
0 = f ′ (c) − m = f ′ (c) −
which turns into
f ′ (c) =

f (b) − f (a)
,
b−a

f (b) − f (a)

b−a

exactly what we want.
Returning to the original formulation of question (2), we see that if f (t) gives the
position of your car at time t, then the Mean Value Theorem says that at some time c,
f ′ (c) = 70, that is, at some time you must have been traveling at exactly your average
speed for the trip, and that indeed you exceeded the speed limit.
Now let’s return to question (1). Suppose, for example, that two functions are known to
have derivative equal to 5 everywhere, f ′ (x) = g ′ (x) = 5. It is easy to find such functions:
5x, 5x + 47, 5x − 132, etc. Are there other, more complicated, examples? No—the only
functions that work are the “obvious” ones, namely, 5x plus some constant. How can we
see that this is true?
Although “5” is a very simple derivative, let’s look at an even simpler one. Suppose
that f ′ (x) = g ′ (x) = 0. Again we can find examples: f (x) = 0, f (x) = 47, f (x) = −511
all have f ′ (x) = 0. Are there non-constant functions f with derivative 0? No, and here’s
why: Suppose that f (x) is not a constant function. This means that there are two points
on the function with diﬀerent heights, say f (a) ̸= f (b). The Mean Value Theorem tells
us that at some point c, f ′ (c) = (f (b) − f (a))/(b − a) ̸= 0. So any non-constant function
does not have a derivative that is zero everywhere; this is the same as saying that the only
functions with zero derivative are the constant functions.
Let’s go back to the slightly less easy example: suppose that f ′ (x) = g ′ (x) = 5. Then
(f (x) − g(x))′ = f ′ (x) − g ′ (x) = 5 − 5 = 0. So using what we discovered in the previous
paragraph, we know that f (x) − g(x) = k, for some constant k. So any two functions with
derivative 5 must diﬀer by a constant; since 5x is known to work, the only other examples
must look like 5x + k.
Now we can extend this to more complicated functions, without any extra work.
Suppose that f ′ (x) = g ′ (x). Then as before (f (x) − g(x))′ = f ′ (x) − g ′ (x) = 0, so
f (x) − g(x) = k. Again this means that if we find just a single function g(x) with a certain
derivative, then every other function with the same derivative must be of the form g(x)+k.
EXAMPLE 6.5.3 Describe all functions that have derivative 5x − 3. It’s easy to find
one: g(x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x has g ′ (x) = 5x − 3. The only other functions with the same
derivative are therefore of the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + k.

146 Chapter 6 Applications of the Derivative
Alternately, though not obviously, you might have first noticed that g(x) = (5/2)x2 −
3x + 47 has g ′ (x) = 5x − 3. Then every other function with the same derivative must
have the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + 47 + k. This looks diﬀerent, but it really isn’t.
The functions of the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + k are exactly the same as the ones of
the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + 47 + k. For example, (5/2)x2 − 3x + 10 is the same as
(5/2)x2 − 3x + 47 + (−37), and the first is of the first form while the second has the second
form.
This is worth calling a theorem:
THEOREM 6.5.4 If f ′ (x) = g ′ (x) for every x ∈ (a, b), then for some constant k,
f (x) = g(x) + k on the interval (a, b).
EXAMPLE 6.5.5 Describe all functions with derivative sin x + ex . One such function
is − cos x + ex , so all such functions have the form − cos x + ex + k.

7.1

Two examples

Up to now we have been concerned with extracting information about how a function
changes from the function itself. Given knowledge about an object’s position, for example,
we want to know the object’s speed. Given information about the height of a curve we
want to know its slope. We now consider problems that are, whether obviously or not, the
reverse of such problems.
EXAMPLE 7.1.1 An object moves in a straight line so that its speed at time t is given
by v(t) = 3t in, say, cm/sec. If the object is at position 10 on the straight line when t = 0,
where is the object at any time t?
There are two reasonable ways to approach this problem. If s(t) is the position of the
object at time t, we know that s′ (t) = v(t). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we
know therefore that s(t) = 3t2 /2 + k, and because s(0) = 10 we easily discover that k = 10,
so s(t) = 3t2 /2 + 10. For example, at t = 1 the object is at position 3/2 + 10 = 11.5. This
is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem. Not all similar problems are so easy,
as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more diﬃcult but also more general.
We start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at t = 0
the object is at position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, t = 1? We
know that the speed of the object at time t = 0 is 0; if its speed were constant then in the
first second the object would not move and its position would still be 10 when t = 1. In
fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at t = 1, but certainly we can do better. Let’s
look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object
147

148 Chapter 7 Integration
at each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant
speed. Since the object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but
only for a tenth of second; during that time the object would not move. During the tenth
of a second from t = 0.1 to t = 0.2, we suppose that the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec,
namely, its actual speed at t = 0.1. In this case the object would travel (0.3)(0.1) = 0.03
centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between t = 0.2 and t = 0.3 the
object would travel (0.6)(0.1) = 0.06 centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation
that the object travels
(0.0)(0.1) + (0.3)(0.1) + (0.6)(0.1) + · · · + (2.7)(0.1) = 1.35
centimeters, ending up at position 11.35. This is a better approximation than 10, certainly,
but is still just an approximation. (We know in fact that the object ends up at position
11.5, because we’ve already done the problem using the first approach.) Presumably,
we will get a better approximation if we divide the time into one hundred intervals of a
hundredth of a second each, and repeat the process:
(0.0)(0.01) + (0.03)(0.01) + (0.06)(0.01) + · · · + (2.97)(0.01) = 1.485.
We thus approximate the position as 11.485. Since we know the exact answer, we can see
that this is much closer, but if we did not already know the answer, we wouldn’t really
know how close.
We can keep this up, but we’ll never really know the exact answer if we simply compute
more and more examples. Let’s instead look at a “typical” approximation. Suppose we
divide the time into n equal intervals, and imagine that on each of these the object travels
at a constant speed. Over the first time interval we approximate the distance traveled
as (0.0)(1/n) = 0, as before. During the second time interval, from t = 1/n to t = 2/n,
the object travels approximately 3(1/n)(1/n) = 3/n2 centimeters. During time interval
number i, the object travels approximately (3(i − 1)/n)(1/n) = 3(i − 1)/n2 centimeters,
that is, its speed at time (i − 1)/n, 3(i − 1)/n, times the length of time interval number i,
1/n. Adding these up as before, we approximate the distance traveled as
(0)

centimeters. What can we say about this? At first it looks rather less useful than the
concrete calculations we’ve already done. But in fact a bit of algebra reveals it to be much

7.1

149

more useful. We can factor out a 3 and 1/n2 to get
3
(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (n − 1)),
n2
that is, 3/n2 times the sum of the first n − 1 positive integers. Now we make use of a fact
you may have run across before:
1 + 2 + 3 + ··· + k =

k(k + 1)
.
2

In our case we’re interested in k = n − 1, so
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (n − 1) =

(n − 1)(n)

Now this is quite easy to understand: as n gets larger and larger this approximation gets
closer and closer to (3/2)(1 − 0) = 3/2, so that 3/2 is the exact distance traveled during
one second, and the final position is 11.5.
So for t = 1, at least, this rather cumbersome approach gives the same answer as
the first approach. But really there’s nothing special about t = 1; let’s just call it t
instead. In this case the approximate distance traveled during time interval number i is
3(i − 1)(t/n)(t/n) = 3(i − 1)t2 /n2 , that is, speed 3(i − 1)(t/n) times time t/n, and the
total distance traveled is approximately

In the limit, as n gets larger, this gets closer and closer to (3/2)t2 and the approximated
position of the object gets closer and closer to (3/2)t2 + 10, so the actual position is
(3/2)t2 + 10, exactly the answer given by the first approach to the problem.
EXAMPLE 7.1.2 Find the area under the curve y = 3x between x = 0 and any positive
value x. There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example,

150 Chapter 7 Integration
but the second approach works fine. (Because the function y = 3x is so simple, there
is another approach that works here, but it is even more limited in potential application
than is approach number one.) How might we approximate the desired area? We know
how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles. Jumping
straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and x into n equal
subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under
the curve. There are many ways we might do this, but let’s use the height of the curve
at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the height of the rectangle, as in figure 7.1.1.
The height of rectangle number i is then 3(i − 1)(x/n), the width is x/n, and the area is
3(i − 1)(x2 /n2 ). The total area of the rectangles is

What you will have noticed, of course, is that while the problem in the second example
appears to be much diﬀerent than the problem in the first example, and while the easy
approach to problem one does not appear to apply to problem two, the “approximation”
approach works in both, and moreover the calculations are identical. As we will see, there

7.2

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

151

are many, many problems that appear much diﬀerent on the surface but that turn out to
be the same as these problems, in the sense that when we try to approximate solutions we
end up with mathematics that looks like the two examples, though of course the function
involved will not always be so simple.
Even better, we now see that while the second problem did not appear to be amenable
to approach one, it can in fact be solved in the same way. The reasoning is this: we know
that problem one can be solved easily by finding a function whose derivative is 3t. We
also know that mathematically the two problems are the same, because both can be solved
by taking a limit of a sum, and the sums are identical. Therefore, we don’t really need
to compute the limit of either sum because we know that we will get the same answer by
computing a function with the derivative 3t or, which is the same thing, 3x.
It’s true that the first problem had the added complication of the “10”, and we certainly
need to be able to deal with such minor variations, but that turns out to be quite simple.
The lesson then is this: whenever we can solve a problem by taking the limit of a sum of
a certain form, we can instead of computing the (often nasty) limit find a new function
with a certain derivative.

7.2

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Let’s recast the first example from the previous section. Suppose that the speed of the
object is 3t at time t. How far does the object travel between time t = a and time t = b?
We are no longer assuming that we know where the object is at time t = 0 or at any other

152 Chapter 7 Integration
time. It is certainly true that it is somewhere, so let’s suppose that at t = 0 the position is k.
Then just as in the example, we know that the position of the object at any time is 3t2 /2+k.
This means that at time t = a the position is 3a2 /2 + k and at time t = b the position is
3b2 /2 + k. Therefore the change in position is 3b2 /2 + k − (3a2 /2 + k) = 3b2 /2 − 3a2 /2.
Notice that the k drops out; this means that it doesn’t matter that we don’t know k, it
doesn’t even matter if we use the wrong k, we get the correct answer. In other words, to
find the change in position between time a and time b we can use any antiderivative of the
speed function 3t—it need not be the one antiderivative that actually gives the location of
the object.
What about the second approach to this problem, in the new form? We now want to
approximate the change in position between time a and time b. We take the interval of
time between a and b, divide it into n subintervals, and approximate the distance traveled
during each. The starting time of subinterval number i is now a + (i − 1)(b − a)/n, which
we abbreviate as ti−1 , so that t0 = a, t1 = a + (b − a)/n, and so on. The speed of the
object is f (t) = 3t, and each subinterval is (b − a)/n = ∆t seconds long. The distance
traveled during subinterval number i is approximately f (ti−1 )∆t, and the total change in
distance is approximately
f (t0 )∆t + f (t1 )∆t + · · · + f (tn−1 )∆t.
The exact change in position is the limit of this sum as n goes to infinity. We abbreviate
this sum using sigma notation:
n−1
∑

f (ti )∆t = f (t0 )∆t + f (t1 )∆t + · · · + f (tn−1 )∆t.

i=0

The notation on the left side of the equal sign uses a large capital sigma, a Greek letter,
and the left side is an abbreviation for the right side. The answer we seek is

lim

n→∞

n−1
∑

f (ti )∆t.

i=0

Since this must be the same as the answer we have already obtained, we know that

The significance of 3t2 /2, into which we substitute t = b and t = a, is of course that it is
a function whose derivative is f (t). As we have discussed, by the time we know that we

it no longer matters what f (t) stands for—it could be a speed, or the height of a curve,
or something else entirely. We know that the limit can be computed by finding any
function with derivative f (t), substituting a and b, and subtracting. We summarize this
in a theorem. First, we introduce some new notation and terms.
We write

hand side. The symbol
is called an integral sign, and the whole expression is read
as “the integral of f (t) from a to b.” What we have learned is that this integral can be
computed by finding a function, say F (t), with the property that F ′ (t) = f (t), and then
computing F (b) − F (a). The function F (t) is called an antiderivative of f (t). Now the
theorem:
Suppose that f (x) is
THEOREM 7.2.1 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
continuous on the interval [a, b]. If F (x) is any antiderivative of f (x), then
∫

b

f (x) dx = F (b) − F (a).

Let’s rewrite this slightly:
∫

x

f (t) dt = F (x) − F (a).
a

We’ve replaced the variable x by t and b by x. These are just diﬀerent names for quantities,
so the substitution doesn’t change the meaning. It does make it easier to think of the two
sides of the equation as functions. The expression
∫ x
f (t) dt
a

is a function: plug in a value for x, get out some other value. The expression F (x) − F (a)
is of course also a function, and it has a nice property:
d
(F (x) − F (a)) = F ′ (x) = f (x),
dx

154 Chapter 7 Integration
since F (a) is a constant and has derivative zero. In other words, by shifting our point of
view slightly, we see that the odd looking function
∫ x
G(x) =
f (t) dt
a

has a derivative, and that in fact G′ (x) = f (x). This is really just a restatement of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and indeed is often called the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus. To avoid confusion, some people call the two versions of the theorem “The
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, part I” and “The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
part II”, although unfortunately there is no universal agreement as to which is part I and
which part II. Since it really is the same theorem, diﬀerently stated, some people simply
call them both “The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.”
THEOREM 7.2.2 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
continuous on the interval [a, b] and let
∫ x
G(x) =
f (t) dt.

Suppose that f (x) is

a

Then G′ (x) = f (x).
We have not really proved the Fundamental Theorem. In a nutshell, we gave the
following argument to justify it: Suppose we want to know the value of
∫

b

f (t) dt = lim
a

n→∞

n−1
∑

f (ti )∆t.

i=0

We can interpret the right hand side as the distance traveled by an object whose speed
is given by f (t). We know another way to compute the answer to such a problem: find
the position of the object by finding an antiderivative of f (t), then substitute t = a and
t = b and subtract to find the distance traveled. This must be the answer to the original
problem as well, even if f (t) does not represent a speed.
What’s wrong with this? In some sense, nothing. As a practical matter it is a very
convincing argument, because our understanding of the relationship between speed and
distance seems to be quite solid. From the point of view of mathematics, however, it
is unsatisfactory to justify a purely mathematical relationship by appealing to our understanding of the physical universe, which could, however unlikely it is in this case, be
wrong.
A complete proof is a bit too involved to include here, but we will indicate how it goes.
First, if we can prove the second version of the Fundamental Theorem, theorem 7.2.2, then
we can prove the first version from that:

7.2

Proof of Theorem 7.2.1.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

We know from theorem 7.2.2 that
∫

x

G(x) =

f (t) dt
a

is an antiderivative of f (x), and therefore any antiderivative F (x) of f (x) is of the form
F (x) = G(x) + k. Then
F (b) − F (a) = G(b) + k − (G(a) + k) = G(b) − G(a)
∫ b
∫
=
f (t) dt −
a

∫

It is not hard to see that

f (t) dt = 0, so this means that
a

∫
F (b) − F (a) =

b

f (t) dt,
a

which is exactly what theorem 7.2.1 says.
So the real job is to prove theorem 7.2.2. We will sketch the proof, using some facts
that we do not prove. First, the following identity is true of integrals:
∫

∫

b

f (t) dt =
a

∫

c

f (t) dt +
a

b

f (t) dt.
c

This can be proved directly from the definition of the integral, that is, using the limits
of sums. It is quite easy to see that it must be true by thinking of either of the two
applications of integrals that we have seen. It turns out that the identity is true no matter
what c is, but it is easiest to think about the meaning when a ≤ c ≤ b.
First, if f (t) represents a speed, then we know that the three integrals represent the
distance traveled between time a and time b; the distance traveled between time a and
time c; and the distance traveled between time c and time b. Clearly the sum of the latter
two is equal to the first of these.
Second, if f (t) represents the height of a curve, the three integrals represent the area
under the curve between a and b; the area under the curve between a and c; and the area
under the curve between c and b. Again it is clear from the geometry that the first is equal
to the sum of the second and third.

156 Chapter 7 Integration
Proof sketch for Theorem 7.2.2.
We want to compute G′ (x), so we start with the
definition of the derivative in terms of a limit:
G(x + ∆x) − G(x)
∆x→0

(∫

∆x→0 ∆x x

G′ (x) = lim

Now we need to know something about
∫

x+∆x

f (t) dt
x

when ∆x is small; in fact, it is very close to ∆xf (x), but we will not prove this. Once
again, it is easy to believe this is true by thinking of our two applications: The integral
∫

x+∆x

f (t) dt
x

can be interpreted as the distance traveled by an object over a very short interval of time.
Over a suﬃciently short period of time, the speed of the object will not change very much,
so the distance traveled will be approximately the length of time multiplied by the speed at
the beginning of the interval, namely, ∆xf (x). Alternately, the integral may be interpreted
as the area under the curve between x and x + ∆x. When ∆x is very small, this will be
very close to the area of the rectangle with base ∆x and height f (x); again this is ∆xf (x).
If we accept this, we may proceed:
1
lim
∆x→0 ∆x

∫

x+∆x

∆xf (x)
= f (x),
∆x→0
∆x

f (t) dt = lim
x

which is what we wanted to show.
It is still true that we are depending on an interpretation of the integral to justify the
argument, but we have isolated this part of the argument into two facts that are not too
hard to prove. Once the last reference to interpretation has been removed from the proofs
of these facts, we will have a real proof of the Fundamental Theorem.

7.2

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Now we know that to solve certain kinds of problems, those that lead to a sum of a
certain form, we “merely” find an antiderivative and substitute two values and subtract.
Unfortunately, finding antiderivatives can be quite diﬃcult. While there are a small number
of rules that allow us to compute the derivative of any common function, there are no such
rules for antiderivatives. There are some techniques that frequently prove useful, but we
will never be able to reduce the problem to a completely mechanical process.
Because of the close relationship between an integral and an antiderivative, the integral
sign is also used to mean “antiderivative”. You can tell which is intended by whether the
limits of integration are included:
∫ 2
x2 dx

namely

We use

∫
x2 dx

to denote the antiderivative of x2 , also called an indefinite integral. So this is evaluated
as
∫
x3
x2 dx =
+ C.
3
It is customary to include the constant C to indicate that there are really an infinite
number of antiderivatives. We do not need this C to compute definite integrals, but in
other circumstances we will need to remember that the C is there, so it is best to get
into the habit of writing the C. When we compute a definite integral, we first find an
antiderivative and then substitute. It is convenient to first display the antiderivative and
then do the substitution; we need a notation indicating that the substitution is yet to be
done. A typical solution would look like this:

Some Properties of Integrals

Suppose an object moves so that its speed, or more properly velocity, is given by v(t) =
−t2 + 5t, as shown in figure 7.3.1. Let’s examine the motion of this object carefully.
We know that the velocity is the derivative of position, so position is given by s(t) =
−t3 /3 + 5t2 /2 + C. Let’s suppose that at time t = 0 the object is at position 0, so
s(t) = −t3 /3 + 5t2 /2; this function is also pictured in figure 7.3.1.
Between t = 0 and t = 5 the velocity is positive, so the object moves away from the
starting point, until it is a bit past position 20. Then the velocity becomes negative and
the object moves back toward its starting point. The position of the object at t = 5 is

The velocity of an object and its position.

exactly s(5) = 125/6, and at t = 6 it is s(6) = 18. The total distance traveled by the
object is therefore 125/6 + (125/6 − 18) = 71/3 ≈ 23.7.
As we have seen, we can also compute distance traveled with an integral; let’s try it.

What went wrong? Well, nothing really, except that it’s not really true after all that “we
can also compute distance traveled with an integral”. Instead, as you might guess from this
example, the integral actually computes the net distance traveled, that is, the diﬀerence
between the starting and ending point.
As we have already seen,
∫

∫

6

v(t) dt =
0

∫

5

v(t) dt +
0

6

v(t) dt.
5

Computing the two integrals on the right (do it!) gives 125/6 and −17/6, and the sum of
these is indeed 18. But what does that negative sign mean? It means precisely what you
might think: it means that the object moves backwards. To get the total distance traveled
we can add 125/6 + 17/6 = 71/3, the same answer we got before.
Remember that we can also interpret an integral as measuring an area, but now we
see that this too is a little more complicated that we have suspected. The area under the
curve v(t) from 0 to 5 is given by
∫

5

v(t) dt =
0

and the “area” from 5 to 6 is

∫

125
,
6

6

v(t) dt = −
5

17
.
6

160 Chapter 7 Integration
In other words, the area between the x-axis and the curve, but under the x-axis, “counts
as negative area”. So the integral
∫

6

v(t) dt = 18
0

measures “net area”, the area above the axis minus the (positive) area below the axis.
If we recall that the integral is the limit of a certain kind of sum, this behavior is not
surprising. Recall the sort of sum involved:
n−1
∑

v(ti )∆t.

i=0

In each term v(t)∆t the ∆t is positive, but if v(ti ) is negative then the term is negative. If
over an entire interval, like 5 to 6, the function is always negative, then the entire sum is
negative. In terms of area, v(t)∆t is then a negative height times a positive width, giving
a negative rectangle “area”.
So now we see that when evaluating
∫

6

v(t) dt = −
5

17
6

by finding an antiderivative, substituting, and subtracting, we get a surprising answer, but
one that turns out to make sense.
Let’s now try something a bit diﬀerent:

6

Here we simply interchanged the limits 5 and 6, so of course when we substitute and
subtract we’re subtracting in the opposite order and we end up multiplying the answer
by −1. This too makes sense in terms of the underlying sum, though it takes a bit more
thought. Recall that in the sum
n−1
∑
v(ti )∆t,
i=0

the ∆t is the “length” of each little subinterval, but more precisely we could say that
∆t = ti+1 − ti , the diﬀerence between two endpoints of a subinterval. We have until now
assumed that we were working left to right, but could as well number the subintervals from

∫

n−1
∑

v(t) dt =

v(ti )∆t,

the values v(ti ) are negative but also ∆t is negative, so all terms are positive again. On
the other hand, in

v(t) dt =

the values v(ti ) are positive but ∆t is negative,and we get a negative result:

Techniques of Integration

Over the next few sections we examine some techniques that are frequently successful when
seeking antiderivatives of functions. Sometimes this is a simple problem, since it will be
apparent that the function you wish to integrate is a derivative in some straightforward
way. For example, faced with
∫
x10 dx
we realize immediately that the derivative of x11 will supply an x10 : (x11 )′ = 11x10 . We
don’t want the “11”, but constants are easy to alter, because diﬀerentiation “ignores” them
in certain circumstances, so
d 1 11

x =
11x10 = x10 .

Substitution

Needless to say, most problems we encounter will not be so simple. Here’s a slightly more
complicated example: find
∫
2x cos(x2 ) dx.
This is not a “simple” derivative, but a little thought reveals that it must have come from
an application of the chain rule. Multiplied on the “outside” is 2x, which is the derivative
of the “inside” function x2 . Checking:
d
d
sin(x2 ) = cos(x2 ) x2 = 2x cos(x2 ),
dx
dx
so

∫
2x cos(x2 ) dx = sin(x2 ) + C.

Even when the chain rule has “produced” a certain derivative, it is not always easy to
see. Consider this problem:
∫
√
x3 1 − x2 dx.
√
There are two factors in this expression, x3 and 1 − x2 , but it is not apparent that the
chain rule is involved. Some clever rearrangement reveals that it is:
∫
x

√

∫
1−

x2

dx =

(

(−2x) −

This looks messy, but we do now have something that looks like the result of the chain

rule: the function 1 − x2 has been substituted into −(1/2)(1 − x) x, and the derivative

So we succeeded, but it required a clever first step, rewriting the original function so
that it looked like the result of using the chain rule. Fortunately, there is a technique that
makes such problems simpler, without requiring cleverness to rewrite a function in just the
right way. It does sometimes not work, or may require more than one attempt, but the
idea is simple: guess at the most likely candidate for the “inside function”, then do some
algebra to see what this requires the rest of the function to look like.
One frequently good guess is any complicated expression inside a square root, so we
start by trying u = 1 − x2 , using a new variable, u, for convenience in the manipulations
that follow. Now we know that the chain rule will multiply by the derivative of this inner
function:
du
= −2x,
dx
so we need to rewrite the original function to include this:
∫
x

√

∫
1 − x2 =

√ −2x
dx =
x u
−2x

∫

x2 √ du

u
−2
dx

Recall that one benefit of the Leibniz notation is that it often turns out that what looks
like ordinary arithmetic gives the correct answer, even if something more complicated is

166 Chapter 8 Techniques of Integration
going on. For example, in Leibniz notation the chain rule is
dy dt
dy
=
.
dx
dt dx
The same is true of our current expression:
∫

x2 √ du
u
dx =
−2
dx

∫

x2 √
u du.
−2

Now we’re almost there: since u = 1 − x2 , x2 = 1 − u and the integral is
∫
√
1
− (1 − u) u du.
2
It’s no coincidence that this is exactly the integral we computed in (8.1.1), we have simply
renamed the variable u to make the calculations less confusing. Just as before:
)
(
∫
√
1
1

u−
u3/2 + C.
− (1 − u) u du =

5
3
Then since u = 1 − x2 :
(
)
∫
√
1
1
3
2
x 1 − x2 dx =
(1 − x ) −
(1 − x2 )3/2 + C.
5
3
To summarize: if we suspect that a given function is the derivative of another via the
chain rule, we let u denote a likely candidate for the inner function, then translate the
given function so that it is written entirely in terms of u, with no x remaining in the
expression. If we can integrate this new function of u, then the antiderivative of the
original function is obtained by replacing u by the equivalent expression in x.
Even in simple cases you may prefer to use this mechanical procedure, since it often
helps to avoid silly mistakes. For example, consider again this simple problem:
∫
2x cos(x2 ) dx.
Let u = x2 , then du/dx = 2x or du = 2x dx. Since we have exactly 2x dx in the original
integral, we can replace it by du:
∫
∫
2
2x cos(x ) dx = cos u du = sin u + C = sin(x2 ) + C.
This is not the only way to do the algebra, and typically there are many paths to the
correct answer. Another possibility, for example, is: Since du/dx = 2x, dx = du/2x, and

then the integral becomes

Trigonometric Substitutions

Trigonometric Substitutions

So far we have seen that it sometimes helps to replace a subexpression of a function by
a single variable. Occasionally it can help to replace the original variable by something
more complicated. This seems like a “reverse” substitution, but it is really no diﬀerent in
principle than ordinary substitution.

√
We would like to replace cos2 u by cos u, but this is valid only if cos u is positive, since
√
cos2 u is positive. Consider again the substitution x = sin u. We could just as well think
of this as u = arcsin x. If we do, then by the definition of the arcsine, −π/2 ≤ u ≤ π/2, so
cos u ≥ 0. Then we continue:

This is a perfectly good answer, though the term sin(2 arcsin x) is a bit unpleasant. It is
possible to simplify this. Using the identity sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x, we can write sin 2u =
√
√
√
2
2 sin u cos u = 2 sin(arcsin x) 1 − sin u = 2x 1 − sin2 (arcsin x) = 2x 1 − x2 . Then the

This type of substitution is usually indicated when the function you wish to integrate
contains a polynomial expression that might allow you to use the fundamental identity
sin2 x + cos2 x = 1 in one of three forms:
cos2 x = 1 − sin2 x

sec2 x = 1 + tan2 x

tan2 x = sec2 x − 1.

If your function contains 1 − x2 , as in the example above, try x = sin u; if it contains 1 + x2
try x = tan u; and if it contains x2 − 1, try x = sec u. Sometimes you will need to try
something a bit diﬀerent to handle constants other than one.

Integration by Parts

We have already seen that recognizing the product rule can be useful, when we noticed
that
∫
sec3 u + sec u tan2 u du = sec u tan u.
As with substitution, we do not have to rely on insight or cleverness to discover such
antiderivatives; there is a technique that will often help to uncover the product rule.
Start with the product rule:
d
f (x)g(x) = f ′ (x)g(x) + f (x)g ′ (x).
dx
We can rewrite this as

∫

f (x)g(x) =
and then

∫

∫

′

f (x)g(x) dx +
∫

′

f (x)g (x) dx = f (x)g(x) −

f (x)g ′ (x) dx,

f ′ (x)g(x) dx.

This may not seem particularly useful at first glance, but it turns out that in many cases
we have an integral of the form
∫
f (x)g ′ (x) dx
but that

∫

f ′ (x)g(x) dx

is easier. This technique for turning one integral into another is called integration by
parts, and is usually written in more compact form. If we let u = f (x) and v = g(x) then

8.4

175

du = f ′ (x) dx and dv = g ′ (x) dx and
∫

u dv = uv −

v du.

To use this technique we need to identify likely candidates for u = f (x) and dv = g ′ (x) dx.

then du = 2 and v = sin x, and

2x cos x dx

Such repeated use of integration by parts is fairly common, but it can be a bit tedious to
accomplish, and it is easy to make errors, especially sign errors involving the subtraction in
the formula. There is a nice tabular method to accomplish the calculation that minimizes
the chance for error and speeds up the whole process. We illustrate with the previous
example. Here is the table:

Integration by Parts

To form the first table, we start with u at the top of the second column and repeatedly
compute the derivative; starting with dv at the top of the third column, we repeatedly
compute the antiderivative. In the first column, we place a “−” in every second row. To
form the second table we combine the first and second columns by ignoring the boundary;
if you do this by hand, you may simply start with two columns and add a “−” to every
second row.
To compute with this second table we begin at the top. Multiply the first entry in
column u by the second entry in column dv to get −x2 cos x, and add this to the integral
of the product of the second entry in column u and second entry in column dv. This gives:
∫
−x cos x +
2

2x cos x dx,

or exactly the result of the first application of integration by parts. Since this integral is
not yet easy, we return to the table. Now we multiply twice on the diagonal, (x2 )(− cos x)
and (−2x)(− sin x) and then once straight across, (2)(− sin x), and combine these as
∫
−x cos x + 2x sin x −
2

2 sin x dx,

giving the same result as the second application of integration by parts. While this integral
is easy, we may return yet once more to the table. Now multiply three times on the diagonal
to get (x2 )(− cos x), (−2x)(− sin x), and (2)(cos x), and once straight across, (0)(cos x).
We combine these as before to get
∫
−x cos x + 2x sin x + 2 cos x +
2

0 dx = −x2 cos x + 2x sin x + 2 cos x + C.

Typically we would fill in the table one line at a time, until the “straight across” multiplication gives an easy integral. If we can see that the u column will eventually become zero,
we can instead fill in the whole table; computing the products as indicated will then give
the entire integral, including the “+C ”, as above.

Rational Functions

A rational function is a fraction with polynomials in the numerator and denominator.
For example,
x3
1
x2 + 1
,
,
,
x2 + x − 6
(x − 3)2
x2 − 1
are all rational functions of x. There is a general technique called “partial fractions”
that, in principle, allows us to integrate any rational function. The algebraic steps in the
technique are rather cumbersome if the polynomial in the denominator has degree more
than 2, and the technique requires that we factor the denominator, something that is not
always possible. However, in practice one does not often run across rational functions with
high degree polynomials in the denominator for which one has to find the antiderivative
function. So we shall explain how to find the antiderivative of a rational function only
when the denominator is a quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c.
We should mention a special type of rational function that we already know how to
integrate: If the denominator has the form (ax + b)n , the substitution u = ax + b will
always work. The denominator becomes un , and each x in the numerator is replaced by
(u − b)/a, and dx = du/a. While it may be tedious to complete the integration if the
numerator has high degree, it is merely a matter of algebra.

We now proceed to the case in which the denominator is a quadratic polynomial. We
can always factor out the coeﬃcient of x2 and put it outside the integral, so we can assume
that the denominator has the form x2 + bx + c. There are three possible cases, depending
on how the quadratic factors: either x2 + bx + c = (x − r)(x − s), x2 + bx + c = (x − r)2 ,
or it doesn’t factor. We can use the quadratic formula to decide which of these we have,
and to factor the quadratic if it is possible.

If x2 + bx + c = (x − r)2 then we have the special case we have already seen, that can
be handled with a substitution. The other two cases require diﬀerent approaches.
If x2 + bx + c = (x − r)(x − s), we have an integral of the form
∫
p(x)

(x − r)(x − s)
where p(x) is a polynomial. The first step is to make sure that p(x) has degree less than
2.

That is, adding two fractions with constant numerator and denominators (x−r) and (x−s)
produces a fraction with denominator (x − r)(x − s) and a polynomial of degree less than
2 for the numerator. We want to reverse this process: starting with a single fraction, we
want to write it as a sum of two simpler fractions. An example should make it clear how
to proceed.

So all we need to do is find A and B so that 7x − 6 = (A + B)x + 3A − 2B, which is to
say, we need 7 = A + B and −6 = 3A − 2B. This is a problem you’ve seen before: solve a

system of two equations in two unknowns. There are many ways to proceed; here’s one: If
7 = A+B then B = 7−A and so −6 = 3A−2B = 3A−2(7−A) = 3A−14+2A = 5A−14.
This is easy to solve for A: A = 8/5, and then B = 7 − A = 7 − 8/5 = 27/5. Thus

Numerical Integration

We have now seen some of the most generally useful methods for discovering antiderivatives,
and there are others. Unfortunately, some functions have no simple antiderivatives; in such
cases if the value of a definite integral is needed it will have to be approximated. We will
see two methods that work reasonably well and yet are fairly simple; in some cases more
sophisticated techniques will be needed.
Of course, we already know one way to approximate an integral: if we think of the
integral as computing an area, we can add up the areas of some rectangles. While this
is quite simple, it is usually the case that a large number of rectangles is needed to get
acceptable accuracy. A similar approach is much better: we approximate the area under a
curve over a small interval as the area of a trapezoid. In figure 8.6.1 we see an area under
a curve approximated by rectangles and by trapezoids; it is apparent that the trapezoids
give a substantially better approximation on each subinterval.

Approximating an area with rectangles and with trapezoids.

As with rectangles, we divide the interval into n equal subintervals of length ∆x. A
f (xi ) + f (xi+1 )
typical trapezoid is pictured in figure 8.6.2; it has area
∆x. If we add up
2

This is usually known as the Trapezoid Rule. For a modest number of subintervals this
is not too diﬃcult to do with a calculator; a computer can easily do many subintervals.

In practice, an approximation is useful only if we know how accurate it is; for example,
we might need a particular value accurate to three decimal places. When we compute a
particular approximation to an integral, the error is the diﬀerence between the approximation and the true value of the integral. For any approximation technique, we need an
error estimate, a value that is guaranteed to be larger than the actual error. If A is an
approximation and E is the associated error estimate, then we know that the true value
of the integral is between A − E and A + E. In the case of our approximation of the
integral, we want E = E(∆x) to be a function of ∆x that gets small rapidly as ∆x gets
small. Fortunately, for many functions, there is such an error estimate associated with the
trapezoid approximation.
THEOREM 8.6.1 Suppose f has a second derivative f ′′ everywhere on the interval
[a, b], and |f ′′ (x)| ≤ M for all x in the interval. With ∆x = (b − a)/n, an error estimate
for the trapezoid approximation is
E(∆x) =

Let’s see how we can use this.

We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need E(∆x) < 0.005 or

With n = 6, the error estimate is thus 1/63 < 0.0047. We compute the trapezoid approximation for six intervals:

f (0)
+ f (1/6) + f (2/6) + · · · + f (5/6) +

)

≈ 0.74512.
6

So the true value of the integral is between 0.74512 − 0.0047 = 0.74042 and 0.74512 +
0.0047 = 0.74982. Unfortunately, the first rounds to 0.74 and the second rounds to 0.75,
so we can’t be sure of the correct value in the second decimal place; we need to pick a larger
n. As it turns out, we need to go to n = 12 to get two bounds that both round to the same
value, which turns out to be 0.75. For comparison, using 12 rectangles to approximate
the area gives 0.7727, which is considerably less accurate than the approximation using six
trapezoids.
In practice it generally pays to start by requiring better than the maximum possible
error; for example, we might have initially required E(∆x) < 0.001, or

Had we immediately tried n = 13 this would have given us the desired answer.
The trapezoid approximation works well, especially compared to rectangles, because
the tops of the trapezoids form a reasonably good approximation to the curve when ∆x is
fairly small. We can extend this idea: what if we try to approximate the curve more closely,

8.6

Numerical Integration

185

by using something other than a straight line? The obvious candidate is a parabola: if we
can approximate a short piece of the curve with a parabola with equation y = ax2 + bx + c,
we can easily compute the area under the parabola.
There are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only
one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points
(xi , f (xi )), (xi+1 , f (xi+1 )), (xi+2 , f (xi+2 )) on the curve, it should be quite close to the
curve over the whole interval [xi , xi+2 ], as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval [a, b]
into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of
parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a
simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through (xi , f (xi )),
(xi+1 , f (xi+1 )), and (xi+2 , f (xi+2 )). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola
y = ax2 + bx + c through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is
fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The
algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we
will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage
worksheet.
To find the parabola, we solve these three equations for a, b, and c:
f (xi ) = a(xi+1 − ∆x)2 + b(xi+1 − ∆x) + c
f (xi+1 ) = a(xi+1 )2 + b(xi+1 ) + c
f (xi+2 ) = a(xi+1 + ∆x)2 + b(xi+1 + ∆x) + c
Not surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily
compute and simplify the integral to get
∫

xi+1 +∆x

ax2 + bx + c dx =
xi+1 −∆x

∆x
(f (xi ) + 4f (xi+1 ) + f (xi+2 )).
3

Now the sum of the areas under all parabolas is
∆x
(f (x0 ) + 4f (x1 ) + f (x2 ) + f (x2 ) + 4f (x3 ) + f (x4 ) + · · · + f (xn−2 ) + 4f (xn−1 ) + f (xn )) =

∆x
(f (x0 ) + 4f (x1 ) + 2f (x2 ) + 4f (x3 ) + 2f (x4 ) + · · · + 2f (xn−2 ) + 4f (xn−1 ) + f (xn )).
3
This is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember
the alternating 2 and 4 coeﬃcients; note that n must be even for this to make sense. This
approximation technique is referred to as Simpson’s Rule.
As with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:

fourth derivative of f = e
is (16x − 48x + 12)e−x ; on [0, 1] this is at most 12 in
absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need.
To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need E(∆x) < 0.005, but taking
a cue from our earlier example, let’s require E(∆x) < 0.001:

11. Using Simpson’s rule on a parabola f (x), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value
of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate f will be f itself. Remarkably,
Simpson’s rule also computes the integral of a cubic function f (x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d
exactly. Show this is true by showing that

Applications of Integration

Area between curves

We have seen how integration can be used to find an area between a curve and the x-axis.
With very little change we can find some areas between curves; indeed, the area between
a curve and the x-axis may be interpreted as the area between the curve and a second
“curve” with equation y = 0. In the simplest of cases, the idea is quite easy to understand.
EXAMPLE 9.1.1 Find the area below f (x) = −x2 + 4x + 3 and above g(x) = −x3 +
7x2 − 10x + 5 over the interval 1 ≤ x ≤ 2. In figure 9.1.1 we show the two curves together,
with the desired area shaded, then f alone with the area under f shaded, and then g alone
with the area under g shaded.

Area between curves as a diﬀerence of areas.

It is clear from the figure that the area we want is the area under f minus the area
under g, which is to say

It doesn’t matter whether we compute the two integrals on the left and then subtract or
compute the single integral on the right. In this case, the latter is perhaps a bit easier:
∫

∫

It is worth examining this problem a bit more. We have seen one way to look at it,
by viewing the desired area as a big area minus a small area, which leads naturally to the
diﬀerence between two integrals. But it is instructive to consider how we might find the
desired area directly. We can approximate the area by dividing the area into thin sections
and approximating the area of each section by a rectangle, as indicated in figure 9.1.2.
The area of a typical rectangle is ∆x(f (xi ) − g(xi )), so the total area is approximately
n−1
∑

(f (xi ) − g(xi ))∆x.

i=0

This is exactly the sort of sum that turns into an integral in the limit, namely the integral
∫

2

f (x) − g(x) dx.
1

Of course, this is the integral we actually computed above, but we have now arrived at it
directly rather than as a modification of the diﬀerence between two other integrals. In that
example it really doesn’t matter which approach we take, but in some cases this second
approach is better.

Approximating area between curves with rectangles.

EXAMPLE 9.1.2 Find the area below f (x) = −x2 + 4x + 1 and above g(x) = −x3 +
7x2 − 10x + 3 over the interval 1 ≤ x ≤ 2; these are the same curves as before but lowered
by 2. In figure 9.1.3 we show the two curves together. Note that the lower curve now dips
below the x-axis. This makes it somewhat tricky to view the desired area as a big area
minus a smaller area, but it is just as easy as before to think of approximating the area
by rectangles. The height of a typical rectangle will still be f (xi ) − g(xi ), even if g(xi ) is
negative. Thus the area is

we need to compute two areas and add them. First we find the intersection point of the

Distance, Velocity, Acceleration

We next recall a general principle that will later be applied to distance-velocity-acceleration
∫ b
problems, among other things. If F (u) is an anti-derivative of f (u), then
f (u) du =
a

F (b) − F (a). Suppose that we want to let the upper limit of integration vary, i.e., we
replace b by some variable x. We think of a as a fixed starting value x0 . In this new
notation the last equation (after adding F (a) to both sides) becomes:
∫

x

F (x) = F (x0 ) +

f (u) du.
x0

(Here u is the variable of integration, called a “dummy variable,” since it is not the variable
in the function F (x). In general, it is not a good idea to use the same letter as a variable
∫ x
of integration and as a limit of integration. That is,
f (x)dx is bad notation, and can
x0

lead to errors and confusion.)
An important application of this principle occurs when we are interested in the position
of an object at time t (say, on the x-axis) and we know its position at time t0 . Let s(t)
denote the position of the object at time t (its distance from a reference point, such as
the origin on the x-axis). Then the net change in position between t0 and t is s(t) − s(t0 ).
Since s(t) is an anti-derivative of the velocity function v(t), we can write
∫

t

s(t) = s(t0 ) +

v(u)du.
t0

Similarly, since the velocity is an anti-derivative of the acceleration function a(t), we have
∫

t

v(t) = v(t0 ) +

a(u)du.
t0

Distance, Velocity, Acceleration

EXAMPLE 9.2.1 Suppose an object is acted upon by a constant force F . Find v(t)
and s(t). By Newton’s law F = ma, so the acceleration is F/m, where m is the mass of
the object. Then we first have

For instance, when F/m = −g is the constant of gravitational acceleration, then this is
the falling body formula (if we neglect air resistance) familiar from elementary physics:
g

2
or in the common case that t0 = 0,
g
s0 + v0 t − t2 .
2
Recall that the integral of the velocity function gives the net distance traveled, that is,
the displacement. If you want to know the total distance traveled, you must find out where
the velocity function crosses the t-axis, integrate separately over the time intervals when
v(t) is positive and when v(t) is negative, and add up the absolute values of the diﬀerent
integrals. For example, if an object is thrown straight upward at 19.6 m/sec, its velocity
function is v(t) = −9.8t + 19.6, using g = 9.8 m/sec2 for the force of gravity. This is a
straight line which is positive for t < 2 and negative for t > 2. The net distance traveled
in the first 4 seconds is thus
∫

(−9.8t + 19.6)dt = 0,

while the total distance traveled in the first 4 seconds is

etc. The value πt = 7π/6, i.e., t = 7/6, is the only value in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.5. Since

Volume

We have seen how to compute certain areas by using integration; some volumes may also
be computed by evaluating an integral. Generally, the volumes that we can compute this
way have cross-sections that are easy to describe.

Volume of a pyramid approximated by rectangular prisms. (AP)

EXAMPLE 9.3.1 Find the volume of a pyramid with a square base that is 20 meters
tall and 20 meters on a side at the base. As with most of our applications of integration, we
begin by asking how we might approximate the volume. Since we can easily compute the
volume of a rectangular prism (that is, a “box”), we will use some boxes to approximate

198 Chapter 9 Applications of Integration
the volume of the pyramid, as shown in figure 9.3.1: on the left is a cross-sectional view, on
the right is a 3D view of part of the pyramid with some of the boxes used to approximate
the volume.
Each box has volume of the form (2xi )(2xi )∆y. Unfortunately, there are two variables
here; fortunately, we can write x in terms of y: x = 10 − y/2 or xi = 10 − yi /2. Then the
total volume is approximately
n−1
∑
4(10 − yi /2)2 ∆y
i=0

and in the limit we get the volume as the value of an integral:

As you may know, the volume of a pyramid is (1/3)(height)(area of base) = (1/3)(20)(400),
which agrees with our answer.
EXAMPLE 9.3.2 The base of a solid is the region between f (x) = x2 − 1 and g(x) =
−x2 + 1, and its cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are equilateral triangles, as
indicated in figure 9.3.2. The solid has been truncated to show a triangular cross-section
above x = 1/2. Find the volume of the solid.

One easy way to get “nice” cross-sections is by rotating a plane figure around a line.

lines; then the result of rotating this around the x-axis, and a typical circular cross-section.

Figure 9.3.3

A solid of rotation. (AP)

Of course a real “slice” of this figure will not have straight sides, but we can approximate the volume of the slice by a cylinder or disk with circular top and bottom and straight
sides; the volume of this disk will have the form πr2 ∆x. As long as we can write r in terms
of x we can compute the volume by an integral.
EXAMPLE 9.3.3 Find the volume of a right circular cone with base radius 10 and
height 20. (A right circular cone is one with a circular base and with the tip of the cone
directly over the center of the base.) We can view this cone as produced by the rotation
of the line y = x/2 rotated about the x-axis, as indicated in figure 9.3.4.
At a particular point on the x-axis, say xi , the radius of the resulting cone is the
y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the line, namely yi = xi /2. Thus the total
volume is approximately

giving us the usual formula for the volume of a cone.
EXAMPLE 9.3.4 Find the volume of the object generated when the area between
y = x2 and y = x is rotated around the x-axis. This solid has a “hole” in the middle; we
can compute the volume by subtracting the volume of the hole from the volume enclosed
by the outer surface of the solid. In figure 9.3.5 we show the region that is rotated, the
resulting solid with the front half cut away, the cone that forms the outer surface, the
horn-shaped hole, and a cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis.
We have already computed the volume of a cone; in this case it is π/3. At a particular
value of x, say xi , the cross-section of the horn is a circle with radius x2i , so the volume of
the horn is

so the desired volume is π/3 − π/5 = 2π/15.
As with the area between curves, there is an alternate approach that computes the
desired volume “all at once” by approximating the volume of the actual solid. We can
approximate the volume of a slice of the solid with a washer-shaped volume, as indicated
in figure 9.3.5.
The volume of such a washer is the area of the face times the thickness. The thickness,
as usual, is ∆x, while the area of the face is the area of the outer circle minus the area of

Of course, what we have done here is exactly the same calculation as before, except we
have in eﬀect recomputed the volume of the outer cone.
Suppose the region between f (x) = x + 1 and g(x) = (x − 1)2 is rotated around the
y-axis; see figure 9.3.6. It is possible, but inconvenient, to compute the volume of the
resulting solid by the method we have used so far. The problem is that there are two
“kinds” of typical rectangles: those that go from the line to the parabola and those that
touch the parabola on both ends. To compute the volume using this approach, we need to

202 Chapter 9 Applications of Integration
break the problem into two parts and compute two integrals:

If instead we consider a typical vertical rectangle, but still rotate around the y-axis, we
get a thin “shell” instead of a thin “washer”. If we add up the volume of such thin shells
we will get an approximation to the true volume. What is the volume of such a shell?
Consider the shell at xi . Imagine that we cut the shell vertically in one place and “unroll”
it into a thin, flat sheet. This sheet will be almost a rectangular prism that is ∆x thick,
f (xi ) − g(xi ) tall, and 2πxi wide (namely, the circumference of the shell before it was
unrolled). The volume will then be approximately the volume of a rectangular prism with
these dimensions: 2πxi (f (xi ) − g(xi ))∆x. If we add these up and take the limit as usual,
we get the integral

Not only does this accomplish the task with only one integral, the integral is somewhat
easier than those in the previous calculation. Things are not always so neat, but it is
often the case that one of the two methods will be simpler than the other, so it is worth
considering both before starting to do calculations.

Average value of a function

The average of some finite set of values is a familiar concept. If, for example, the class
scores on a quiz are 10, 9, 10, 8, 7, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2, 7, 8, then the average score is the sum of
these numbers divided by the size of the class:
average score =

10 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 7 + 8
82
=
≈ 6.83.
12
12

Suppose that between t = 0 and t = 1 the speed of an object is sin(πt). What is the
average speed of the object over that time? The question sounds as if it must make sense,
yet we can’t merely add up some number of speeds and divide, since the speed is changing
continuously over the time interval.
To make sense of “average” in this context, we fall back on the idea of approximation.
Consider the speed of the object at tenth of a second intervals: sin 0, sin(0.1π), sin(0.2π),
sin(0.3π),. . . , sin(0.9π). The average speed “should” be fairly close to the average of these
ten speeds:
9
1 ∑
1
6.3 = 0.63.
sin(πi/10) ≈
10 i=0
10
Of course, if we compute more speeds at more times, the average of these speeds should
be closer to the “real” average. If we take the average of n speeds at evenly spaced times,
we get:
n−1
1∑
sin(πi/n).
n i=0
Here the individual times are ti = i/n, so rewriting slightly we have
n−1
1∑
sin(πti ).
n i=0

This is almost the sort of sum that we know turns into an integral; what’s apparently
missing is ∆t—but in fact, ∆t = 1/n, the length of each subinterval. So rewriting again:
n−1
∑
i=0

sin(πti )

n−1
∑
1
sin(πti )∆t.
=
n
i=0

Now this has exactly the right form, so that in the limit we get

average speed =
sin(πt) dt = −
=−
+
= ≈ 0.6366 ≈ 0.64.

It’s not entirely obvious from this one simple example how to compute such an average
in general. Let’s look at a somewhat more complicated case. Suppose that the velocity

9.4

of an object is 16t2 + 5 feet per second. What is the average velocity between t = 1 and
t = 3? Again we set up an approximation to the average:
n−1
1∑
16t2i + 5,
n i=0

where the values ti are evenly spaced times between 1 and 3. Once again we are “missing”
∆t, and this time 1/n is not the correct value. What is ∆t in general? It is the length of
a subinterval; in this case we take the interval [1, 3] and divide it into n subintervals, so
each has length (3 − 1)/n = 2/n = ∆t. Now with the usual “multiply and divide by the
same thing” trick we can rewrite the sum:
n−1

Does this seem reasonable? Let’s picture it: in figure 9.4.1 is the velocity function together
with the horizontal line y = 223/3 ≈ 74.3. Certainly the height of the horizontal line looks
at least plausible for the average height of the curve.

Average velocity.

Here’s another way to interpret “average” that may make our computation appear
even more reasonable. The object of our example goes a certain distance between t = 1

206 Chapter 9 Applications of Integration
and t = 3. If instead the object were to travel at the average speed over the same time, it
should go the same distance. At an average speed of 223/3 feet per second for two seconds
the object would go 446/3 feet. How far does it actually go? We know how to compute
this:
∫ 3
∫ 3
446
.
v(t) dt =
16t2 + 5 dt =

So now we see that another interpretation of the calculation
1

∫

is: total distance traveled divided by the time in transit, namely, the usual interpretation
of average speed.
In the case of speed, or more properly velocity, we can always interpret “average” as
total (net) distance divided by time. But in the case of a diﬀerent sort of quantity this
interpretation does not obviously apply, while the approximation approach always does.
We might interpret the same problem geometrically: what is the average height of 16x2 + 5
on the interval [1, 3]? We approximate this in exactly the same way, by adding up many
sample heights and dividing by the number of samples. In the limit we get the same result:

We can interpret this result in a slightly diﬀerent way. The area under y = 16x2 + 5 above
[1, 3] is
∫ 3

.

The area under y = 223/3 over the same interval [1, 3] is simply the area of a rectangle
that is 2 by 223/3 with area 446/3. So the average height of a function is the height of the
horizontal line that produces the same area over the given interval.

Work

A fundamental concept in classical physics is work: If an object is moved in a straight
line against a force F for a distance s the work done is W = F s.
EXAMPLE 9.5.1 How much work is done in lifting a 10 pound weight vertically a
distance of 5 feet? The force due to gravity on a 10 pound weight is 10 pounds at the
surface of the earth, and it does not change appreciably over 5 feet. The work done is
W = 10 · 5 = 50 foot-pounds.
In reality few situations are so simple. The force might not be constant over the range
of motion, as in the next example.
EXAMPLE 9.5.2 How much work is done in lifting a 10 pound weight from the surface
of the earth to an orbit 100 miles above the surface? Over 100 miles the force due to gravity
does change significantly, so we need to take this into account. The force exerted on a 10
pound weight at a distance r from the center of the earth is F = k/r2 and by definition
it is 10 when r is the radius of the earth (we assume the earth is a sphere). How can we
approximate the work done? We divide the path from the surface to orbit into n small
subpaths. On each subpath the force due to gravity is roughly constant, with value k/ri2
at distance ri . The work to raise the object from ri to ri+1 is thus approximately k/ri2 ∆r
and the total work is approximately

Using r0 = 20925525 feet we have r1 = 21453525. The force on the 10 pound weight at
the surface of the earth is 10 pounds, so 10 = k/209255252 , giving k = 4378775965256250.

foot-pounds.

Note that if we assume the force due to gravity is 10 pounds over the whole distance we
would calculate the work as 10(r1 − r0 ) = 10 · 100 · 5280 = 5280000, somewhat higher since
we don’t account for the weakening of the gravitational force.
EXAMPLE 9.5.3 How much work is done in lifting a 10 kilogram object from the
surface of the earth to a distance D from the center of the earth? This is the same
problem as before in diﬀerent units, and we are not specifying a value for D. As before

While “weight in pounds” is a measure of force, “weight in kilograms” is a measure of mass.
To convert to force we need to use Newton’s law F = ma. At the surface of the earth the
acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared, so the force is
F = 10 · 9.8 = 98. The units here are “kilogram-meters per second squared” or “kg m/s2 ”,
also known as a Newton (N), so F = 98 N. The radius of the earth is approximately 6378.1
kilometers or 6378100 meters. Now the problem proceeds as before. From F = k/r2 we
compute k: 98 = k/63781002 , k = 3.986655642 · 1015 . Then the work is:
W =−

k
+ 6.250538000 · 108
D

Newton-meters.

As D increases W of course gets larger, since the quantity being subtracted, −k/D, gets
smaller. But note that the work W will never exceed 6.250538000 · 108 , and in fact will
approach this value as D gets larger. In short, with a finite amount of work, namely
6.250538000 · 108 N-m, we can lift the 10 kilogram object as far as we wish from earth.
Next is an example in which the force is constant, but there are many objects moving
diﬀerent distances.
EXAMPLE 9.5.4 Suppose that a water tank is shaped like a right circular cone with
the tip at the bottom, and has height 10 meters and radius 2 meters at the top. If the
tank is full, how much work is required to pump all the water out over the top? Here we
have a large number of atoms of water that must be lifted diﬀerent distances to get to the
top of the tank. Fortunately, we don’t really have to deal with individual atoms—we can
consider all the atoms at a given depth together.

Cross-section of a conical water tank.

To approximate the work, we can divide the water in the tank into horizontal sections,
approximate the volume of water in a section by a thin disk, and compute the amount of
work required to lift each disk to the top of the tank. As usual, we take the limit as the
sections get thinner and thinner to get the total work.
At depth h the circular cross-section through the tank has radius r = (10 − h)/5, by
similar triangles, and area π(10 − h)2 /25. A section of the tank at depth h thus has volume
approximately π(10 − h)2 /25∆h and so contains σπ(10 − h)2 /25∆h kilograms of water,
where σ is the density of water in kilograms per cubic meter; σ ≈ 1000. The force due to
gravity on this much water is 9.8σπ(10 − h)2 /25∆h, and finally, this section of water must
be lifted a distance h, which requires h9.8σπ(10 − h)2 /25∆h Newton-meters of work. The

A spring has a “natural length,” its length if nothing is stretching or compressing
it. If the spring is either stretched or compressed the spring provides an opposing force;
according to Hooke’s Law the magnitude of this force is proportional to the distance the
spring has been stretched or compressed: F = kx. The constant of proportionality, k, of
course depends on the spring. Note that x here represents the change in length from the
natural length.
EXAMPLE 9.5.5 Suppose k = 5 for a given spring that has a natural length of 0.1

the magnitude of the force? Assuming that the constant k has appropriate dimensions
(namely, kg/s2 ), the force is 5(0.1 − 0.08) = 5(0.02) = 0.1 Newtons.

EXAMPLE 9.5.6 How much work is done in compressing the spring in the previous
example from its natural length to 0.08 meters? From 0.08 meters to 0.05 meters? How
much work is done to stretch the spring from 0.1 meters to 0.15 meters? We can approximate the work by dividing the distance that the spring is compressed (or stretched) into
small subintervals. Then the force exerted by the spring is approximately constant over the
subinterval, so the work required to compress the spring from xi to xi+1 is approximately
5(xi − 0.1)∆x. The total work is approximately

Suppose a beam is 10 meters long, and that there are three weights on the beam: a 10
kilogram weight 3 meters from the left end, a 5 kilogram weight 6 meters from the left end,
and a 4 kilogram weight 8 meters from the left end. Where should a fulcrum be placed
so that the beam balances? Let’s assign a scale to the beam, from 0 at the left end to 10
at the right, so that we can denote locations on the beam simply as x coordinates; the
weights are at x = 3, x = 6, and x = 8, as in figure 9.6.1.

A beam with three masses.

Suppose to begin with that the fulcrum is placed at x = 5. What will happen? Each
weight applies a force to the beam that tends to rotate it around the fulcrum; this eﬀect
is measured by a quantity called torque, proportional to the mass times the distance
from the fulcrum. Of course, weights on diﬀerent sides of the fulcrum rotate the beam
in opposite directions. We can distinguish this by using a signed distance in the formula
for torque. So with the fulcrum at 5, the torques induced by the three weights will be
proportional to (3 − 5)10 = −20, (6 − 5)5 = 5, and (8 − 5)4 = 12. For the beam to
balance, the sum of the torques must be zero; since the sum is −20 + 5 + 12 = −3, the
beam rotates counter-clockwise, and to get the beam to balance we need to move the
fulcrum to the left. To calculate exactly where the fulcrum should be, we let x̄ denote the
location of the fulcrum when the beam is in balance. The total torque on the beam is then

212 Chapter 9 Applications of Integration
(3 − x̄)10 + (6 − x̄)5 + (8 − x̄)4 = 92 − 19x̄. Since the beam balances at x̄ it must be that
92 − 19x̄ = 0 or x̄ = 92/19 ≈ 4.84, that is, the fulcrum should be placed at x = 92/19 to
balance the beam.
Now suppose that we have a beam with varying density—some portions of the beam
contain more mass than other portions of the same size. We want to figure out where to
put the fulcrum so that the beam balances.

A solid beam.

EXAMPLE 9.6.1 Suppose the beam is 10 meters long and that the density is 1 + x
kilograms per meter at location x on the beam. To approximate the solution, we can think
of the beam as a sequence of weights “on” a beam. For example, we can think of the
portion of the beam between x = 0 and x = 1 as a weight sitting at x = 0, the portion
between x = 1 and x = 2 as a weight sitting at x = 1, and so on, as indicated in figure 9.6.2.
We then approximate the mass of the weights by assuming that each portion of the beam
has constant density. So the mass of the first weight is approximately m0 = (1 + 0)1 = 1
kilograms, namely, (1 + 0) kilograms per meter times 1 meter. The second weight is
m1 = (1 + 1)1 = 2 kilograms, and so on to the tenth weight with m9 = (1 + 9)1 = 10
kilograms. So in this case the total torque is
(0 − x̄)m0 + (1 − x̄)m1 + · · · + (9 − x̄)m9 = (0 − x̄)1 + (1 − x̄)2 + · · · + (9 − x̄)10.
If we set this to zero and solve for x̄ we get x̄ = 6. In general, if we divide the beam into
n portions, the mass of weight number i will be mi = (1 + xi )(xi+1 − xi ) = (1 + xi )∆x
and the torque induced by weight number i will be (xi − x̄)mi = (xi − x̄)(1 + xi )∆x. The
total torque is then
(x0 − x̄)(1 + x0 )∆x + (x1 − x̄)(1 + x1 )∆x + · · · + (xn−1 − x̄)(1 + xn−1 )∆x

The denominator of this fraction has a very familiar interpretation. Consider one term of
the sum in the denominator: (1 + xi )∆x. This is the density near xi times a short length,
∆x, which in other words is approximately the mass of the beam between xi and xi+1 .
When we add these up we get approximately the mass of the beam.
Now each of the sums in the fraction has the right form to turn into an integral, which
in turn gives us the exact value of x̄:

It should be apparent that there was nothing special about the density function σ(x) =
1 + x or the length of the beam, or even that the left end of the beam is at the origin.

except that the beam has been moved. Note that the density at the left end is 20 − 19 = 1

EXAMPLE 9.6.3 Suppose a flat plate of uniform density has the shape contained by
y = x2 , y = 1, and x = 0, in the first quadrant. Find the center of mass. (Since the density
is constant, the center of mass depends only on the shape of the plate, not the density, or
in other words, this is a purely geometric quantity. In such a case the center of mass is
called the centroid.)
This is a two dimensional problem, but it can be solved as if it were two one dimensional
problems: we need to find the x and y coordinates of the center of mass, x̄ and ȳ, and
fortunately we can do these independently. Imagine looking at the plate edge on, from
below the x-axis. The plate will appear to be a beam, and the mass of a short section

of the “beam”, say between xi and xi+1 , is the mass of a strip of the plate between xi
and xi+1 . See figure 9.6.3 showing the plate from above and as it appears edge on. Since
the plate has uniform density we may as well assume that σ = 1. Then the mass of the
plate between xi and xi+1 is approximately mi = σ(1 − x2i )∆x = (1 − x2i )∆x. Now we can
compute the moment around the y-axis:

Such an integral, with a limit of infinity, is called an improper integral. This is a bit
unfortunate, since it’s not really “improper” to do this, nor is it really “an integral”—it is
an abbreviation for the limit of a particular sort of integral. Nevertheless, we’re stuck with
the term, and the operation itself is perfectly legitimate. It may at first seem odd that a
finite amount of work is suﬃcient to lift an object to “infinity”, but sometimes surprising
things are nevertheless true, and this is such a case. If the value of an improper integral
is a finite number, as in this example, we say that the integral converges, and if not we
say that the integral diverges.
Here’s another way, perhaps even more surprising, to interpret this calculation. We
know that one interpretation of
∫ D
1
dx
x2
1
is the area under y = 1/x2 from x = 1 to x = D. Of course, as D increases this area
increases. But since

while the area increases, it never exceeds 1, that is

The area of the infinite region under y = 1/x2 from x = 1 to infinity is finite.

So we get the same answer either way. This does not always happen; sometimes the second
approach gives a finite number, while the first approach does not; the exercises provide
∫ ∞
examples. In general, we interpret the integral
f (x) dx according to the first method:
−∞
∫ a

both integrals
f (x) dx and
f (x) dx must converge for the original integral to

converge. The second approach does turn out to be useful; when lim
f (x) dx = L,
D→∞ −D
∫ ∞
and L is finite, then L is called the Cauchy Principal Value of
f (x) dx.
−∞

Here’s a more concrete application of these ideas. We know that in general
∫

x1

W =

F dx
x0

is the work done against the force F in moving from x0 to x1 . In the case that F is the
force of gravity exerted by the earth, it is customary to make F < 0 since the force is

9.7

Kinetic energy; improper integrals

219

“downward.” This makes the work W negative when it should be positive, so typically the
work in this case is defined as
∫ x1
W =−
F dx.
x0

Also, by Newton’s Law, F = ma(t). This means that
∫
W =−

x1

ma(t) dx.
x0

Unfortunately this integral is a bit problematic: a(t) is in terms of t, while the limits and
the “dx” are in terms of x. But x and t are certainly related here: x = x(t) is the function
that gives the position of the object at time t, so v = v(t) = dx/dt = x′ (t) is its velocity
and a(t) = v ′ (t) = x′′ (t). We can use v = x′ (t) as a substitution to convert the integral
from “dx” to “dv” in the usual way, with a bit of cleverness along the way:
dv = x′′ (t) dt = a(t) dt = a(t)

You may recall seeing the expression mv 2 /2 in a physics course—it is called the kinetic
energy of the object. We have shown here that the work done in moving the object from
one place to another is the same as the change in kinetic energy.
We know that the work required to move an object from the surface of the earth to
infinity is

At the surface of the earth the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 meters
per second squared, so the force on an object of mass m is F = 9.8m. The radius of the
earth is approximately 6378.1 kilometers or 6378100 meters. Since the force due to gravity
obeys an inverse square law, F = k/r2 and 9.8m = k/63781002 , k = 398665564178000m
and W = 62505380m.

220 Chapter 9 Applications of Integration
Now suppose that the initial velocity of the object, v0 , is just enough to get it to
infinity, that is, just enough so that the object never slows to a stop, but so that its speed
decreases to zero, i.e., so that v1 = 0. Then
62505380m = W = −

meters per second,

or about 40251 kilometers per hour. This speed is called the escape velocity. Notice that
the mass of the object, m, canceled out at the last step; the escape velocity is the same
for all objects. Of course, it takes considerably more energy to get a large object up to
40251 kph than a small one, so it is certainly more diﬃcult to get a large object into deep
space than a small one. Also, note that while we have computed the escape velocity for
the earth, this speed would not in fact get an object “to infinity” because of the large mass
in our neighborhood called the sun. Escape velocity for the sun starting at the distance of
the earth from the sun is nearly 4 times the escape velocity we have calculated.

Probability

You perhaps have at least a rudimentary understanding of discrete probability, which
measures the likelihood of an “event” when there are a finite number of possibilities. For
example, when an ordinary six-sided die is rolled, the probability of getting any particular
number is 1/6. In general, the probability of an event is the number of ways the event can
happen divided by the number of ways that “anything” can happen.
For a slightly more complicated example, consider the case of two six-sided dice. The
dice are physically distinct, which means that rolling a 2–5 is diﬀerent than rolling a 5–2;
each is an equally likely event out of a total of 36 ways the dice can land, so each has a
probability of 1/36.
Most interesting events are not so simple. More interesting is the probability of rolling
a certain sum out of the possibilities 2 through 12. It is clearly not true that all sums are
equally likely: the only way to roll a 2 is to roll 1–1, while there are many ways to roll a 7.
Because the number of possibilities is quite small, and because a pattern quickly becomes
evident, it is easy to see that the probabilities of the various sums are:
P (2) = P (12) = 1/36
P (3) = P (11) = 2/36
P (4) = P (10) = 3/36
P (5) = P (9) = 4/36
P (6) = P (8) = 5/36
P (7) = 6/36
Here we use P (n) to mean “the probability of rolling an n.” Since we have correctly
accounted for all possibilities, the sum of all these probabilities is 36/36 = 1; the probability
that the sum is one of 2 through 12 is 1, because there are no other possibilities.

222 Chapter 9 Applications of Integration
The study of probability is concerned with more diﬃcult questions as well; for example,
suppose the two dice are rolled many times. On the average, what sum will come up? In
the language of probability, this average is called the expected value of the sum. This is
at first a little misleading, as it does not tell us what to “expect” when the two dice are
rolled, but what we expect the long term average will be.
Suppose that two dice are rolled 36 million times. Based on the probabilities, we would
expect about 1 million rolls to be 2, about 2 million to be 3, and so on, with a roll of 7
topping the list at about 6 million. The sum of all rolls would be 1 million times 2 plus 2
million times 3, and so on, and dividing by 36 million we would get the average:

iP (i) = 7.

i=2

There is nothing special about the 36 million in this calculation. No matter what the
12
∑
number of rolls, once we simplify the average, we get the same
iP (i). While the actual
i=2

average value of a large number of rolls will not be exactly 7, the average should be close
to 7 when the number of rolls is large. Turning this around, if the average is not close to
7, we should suspect that the dice are not fair.
A variable, say X, that can take certain values, each with a corresponding probability,
is called a random variable; in the example above, the random variable was the sum of
the two dice. If the possible values for X are x1 , x2 ,. . . ,xn , then the expected value of the
n
∑
random variable is E(X) =
xi P (xi ). The expected value is also called the mean.
i=1

When the number of possible values for X is finite, we say that X is a discrete random
variable. In many applications of probability, the number of possible values of a random
variable is very large, perhaps even infinite. To deal with the infinite case we need a
diﬀerent approach, and since there is a sum involved, it should not be wholly surprising
that integration turns out to be a useful tool. It then turns out that even when the
number of possibilities is large but finite, it is frequently easier to pretend that the number
is infinite. Suppose, for example, that a dart is thrown at a dart board. Since the dart
board consists of a finite number of atoms, there are in some sense only a finite number
of places for the dart to land, but it is easier to explore the probabilities involved by
pretending that the dart can land on any point in the usual x-y plane.

Probability

223

DEFINITION 9.8.1 Let f : R → R be a function. If f (x) ≥ 0 for every x and
∫ ∞
f (x) dx = 1 then f is a probability density function.
−∞

We associate a probability density function with a random variable X by stipulating
∫ b
that the probability that X is between a and b is
f (x) dx. Because of the requirement
a

that the integral from −∞ to ∞ be 1, all probabilities are less than or equal to 1, and the
probability that X takes on some value between −∞ and ∞ is 1, as it should be.
EXAMPLE 9.8.2 Consider again the two dice example; we can view it in a way that
more resembles the probability density function approach. Consider a random variable X
that takes on any real value with probabilities given by the probability density function in
figure 9.8.1. The function f consists of just the top edges of the rectangles, with vertical
sides drawn for clarity; the function is zero below 1.5 and above 12.5. The area of each
rectangle is the probability of rolling the sum in the middle of the bottom of the rectangle,
or

f (x) dx.
n−1/2

The probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6 is

P (n) =

f (x) dx.

Of course, we could also compute probabilities that don’t make sense in the context of the
dice, such as the probability that X is between 4 and 5.8.

The function

is called the cumulative distribution function or simply (probability) distribution.
EXAMPLE 9.8.3

Suppose that a < b and
{

f (x) = b − a if a ≤ x ≤ b

otherwise.

Then f (x) is the uniform probability density function on [a, b]. and the corresponding
distribution is the uniform distribution on [a, b].

We cannot find an antiderivative of f , but we can see that this integral is some finite

under e−x /2 is less than the area under e−x/2 , over the interval [1, ∞). It is easy to

We have shown that A is some finite number without computing it; we cannot compute
it with the techniques we have available. By using some techniques from multivariable

calculus, it can be shown that A = 2π.

The mean or expected value of a random variable is quite useful, as hinted at in
our discussion of dice. Recall that the mean for a discrete random variable is E(X) =
n
∑
xi P (xi ). In the more general context we use an integral in place of the sum.
i=1

DEFINITION 9.8.6 The mean of a random variable X with probability density func∫ ∞
tion f is µ = E(X) =
xf (x) dx, provided the integral converges.
−∞

When the mean exists it is unique, since it is the result of an explicit calculation. The
mean does not always exist.
The mean might look familiar; it is essentially identical to the center of mass of a onedimensional beam, as discussed in section 9.6. The probability density function f plays
the role of the physical density function, but now the “beam” has infinite length. If we
consider only a finite portion of the beam, say between a and b, then the center of mass is
∫

f (x) dx = 1. In the center of mass interpretation, this integral is the total

The sum of these is 0, which is the mean.
While the mean is very useful, it typically is not enough information to properly
evaluate a situation. For example, suppose we could manufacture an 11-sided die, with
the faces numbered 2 through 12 so that each face is equally likely to be down when the die
is rolled. The value of a roll is the value on this lower face. Rolling the die gives the same
range of values as rolling two ordinary dice, but now each value occurs with probability
1/11. The expected value of a roll is

+ ··· +
= 7.
11 11
11
The mean does not distinguish the two cases, though of course they are quite diﬀerent.
If f is a probability density function for a random variable X, with mean µ, we would
like to measure how far a “typical” value of X is from µ. One way to measure this distance

9.8

227

Probability

is (X − µ)2 ; we square the diﬀerence so as to measure all distances as positive. To get the
typical such squared distance, we compute the mean. For two dice, for example, we get
(2 − 7)2

Because we squared the diﬀerences this does not directly measure the typical distance we
√
seek; if we take the square root of this we do get such a measure, 35/36 ≈ 2.42. Doing
the computation for the strange 11-sided die we get

with square root approximately 3.16. Comparing 2.42 to 3.16 tells us that the two-dice
rolls clump somewhat more closely near 7 than the rolls of the weird die, which of course
we already knew because these examples are quite simple.
To perform the same computation for a probability density function the sum is replaced
by an integral, just as in the computation of the mean. The expected value of the squared
distances is
∫
∞

V (X) =
−∞

(x − µ)2 f (x) dx,

called the variance. The square root of the variance is the standard deviation, denoted
σ.

EXAMPLE 9.8.9 Here is a simple example showing how these ideas can be useful.
Suppose it is known that, in the long run, 1 out of every 100 computer memory chips
produced by a certain manufacturing plant is defective when the manufacturing process is
running correctly. Suppose 1000 chips are selected at random and 15 of them are defective.
This is more than the ‘expected’ number (10), but is it so many that we should suspect
that something has gone wrong in the manufacturing process? We are interested in the
probability that various numbers of defective chips arise; the probability distribution is
discrete: there can only be a whole number of defective chips. But (under reasonable
assumptions) the distribution is very close to a normal distribution, namely this one:

Normal density function for the defective chips example.

Now how do we measure how unlikely it is that under normal circumstances we would
see 15 defective chips? We can’t compute the probability of exactly 15 defective chips, as
∫ 15
∫ 15.5
this would be
f (x) dx = 0. We could compute
f (x) dx ≈ 0.036; this means there
15

14.5

is only a 3.6% chance that the number of defective chips is 15. (We cannot compute these
integrals exactly; computer software has been used to approximate the integral values in
∫ 10.5
this discussion.) But this is misleading:
f (x) dx ≈ 0.126, which is larger, certainly,
9.5

but still small, even for the “most likely” outcome. The most useful question, in most
circumstances, is this: how likely is it that the number of defective chips is “far from”
the mean? For example, how likely, or unlikely, is it that the number of defective chips
is diﬀerent by 5 or more from the expected value of 10? This is the probability that the
number of defective chips is less than 5 or larger than 15, namely
∫

∫

5

∞

f (x) dx +
−∞

f (x) dx ≈ 0.11.

15

So there is an 11% chance that this happens—not large, but not tiny. Hence the 15
defective chips does not appear to be cause for alarm: about one time in nine we would

9.8

Probability

229

expect to see the number of defective chips 5 or more away from the expected 10. How
about 20? Here we compute
∫

∫

0

∞

f (x) dx +
−∞

f (x) dx ≈ 0.0015.

20

So there is only a 0.15% chance that the number of defective chips is more than 10 away
from the mean; this would typically be interpreted as too suspicious to ignore—it shouldn’t
happen if the process is running normally.
The big question, of course, is what level of improbability should trigger concern?
It depends to some degree on the application, and in particular on the consequences of
getting it wrong in one direction or the other. If we’re wrong, do we lose a little money?
A lot of money? Do people die? In general, the standard choices are 5% and 1%. So what
we should do is find the number of defective chips that has only, let us say, a 1% chance
of occurring under normal circumstances, and use that as the relevant number. In other
words, we want to know when
∫

∫

10−r

∞

f (x) dx +
−∞

f (x) dx < 0.01.
10+r

A bit of trial and error shows that with r = 8 the value is about 0.011, and with r = 9 it
is about 0.004, so if the number of defective chips is 19 or more, or 1 or fewer, we should
look for problems. If the number is high, we worry that the manufacturing process has
a problem, or conceivably that the process that tests for defective chips is not working
correctly and is flagging good chips as defective. If the number is too low, we suspect that
the testing procedure is broken, and is not detecting defective chips.

Here is another geometric application of the integral: find the length of a portion of a

We already know how to compute one simple arc length, that of a line segment. If the

Figure 9.9.2

Approximating arc length with line segments.

Now if the graph of f is “nice” (say, diﬀerentiable) it appears that we can approximate
the length of a portion of the curve with line segments, and that as the number of segments
increases, and their lengths decrease, the sum of the lengths of the line segments will
approach the true arc length; see figure 9.9.2.
Now we need to write a formula for the sum of the lengths of the line segments, in a
form that we know becomes an integral in the limit. So we suppose we have divided the
interval [a, b] into n subintervals as usual, each with length ∆x = (b − a)/n, and endpoints
a = x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . , xn = b. The length of a typical line segment, joining (xi , f (xi ))
√
to (xi+1 , f (xi+1 )), is (∆x)2 + (f (xi+1 ) − f (xi ))2 . By the Mean Value Theorem (6.5.2),
there is a number ti in (xi , xi+1 ) such that f ′ (ti )∆x = f (xi+1 ) − f (xi ), so the length of
the line segment can be written as
√
√
(∆x)2 + (f ′ (ti ))2 ∆x2 = 1 + (f ′ (ti ))2 ∆x.

Note that the sum looks a bit diﬀerent than others we have encountered, because the
approximation contains a ti instead of an xi . In the past we have always used left endpoints
(namely, xi ) to get a representative value of f on [xi , xi+1 ]; now we are using a diﬀerent
point, but the principle is the same.
To summarize, to compute the length of a curve on the interval [a, b], we compute the
integral
∫ b√
1 + (f ′ (x))2 dx.

Unfortunately, integrals of this form are typically diﬃcult or impossible to compute exactly,
because usually none of our methods for finding antiderivatives will work. In practice this
means that the integral will usually have to be approximated.

Surface Area

Another geometric question that arises naturally is: “What is the surface area of a volume?” For example, what is the surface area of a sphere? More advanced techniques
are required to approach this question in general, but we can compute the areas of some
volumes generated by revolution.

9.10

Surface Area

233

As usual, the question is: how might we approximate the surface area? For a surface
obtained by rotating a curve around an axis, we can take a polygonal approximation to
the curve, as in the last section, and rotate it around the same axis. This gives a surface
composed of many “truncated cones;” a truncated cone is called a frustum of a cone.
Figure 9.10.1 illustrates this approximation.

Figure 9.10.1

Approximating a surface (left) by portions of cones (right).

So we need to be able to compute the area of a frustum of a cone. Since the frustum
can be formed by removing a small cone from the top of a larger one, we can compute
the desired area if we know the surface area of a cone. Suppose a right circular cone has
base radius r and slant height h. If we cut the cone from the vertex to the base circle
and flatten it out, we obtain a sector of a circle with radius h and arc length 2πr, as in
figure 9.10.2. The angle at the center, in radians, is then 2πr/h, and the area of the cone
is equal to the area of the sector of the circle. Let A be the area of the sector; since the
area of the entire circle is πh2 , we have
A
2πr/h
=
2
πh
2π
A = πrh.
Now suppose we have a frustum of a cone with slant height h and radii r0 and r1 , as
in figure 9.10.3. The area of the entire cone is πr1 (h0 + h), and the area of the small cone
is πr0 h0 ; thus, the area of the frustum is πr1 (h0 + h) − πr0 h0 = π((r1 − r0 )h0 + r1 h). By

With a bit of algebra this becomes (r1 − r0 )h0 = r0 h; substitution into the area gives
π((r1 − r0 )h0 + r1 h) = π(r0 h + r1 h) = πh(r0 + r1 ) = 2π

r0 + r1
h = 2πrh.

The final form is particularly easy to remember, with r equal to the average of r0 and r1 ,
as it is also the formula for the area of a cylinder. (Think of a cylinder of radius r and
height h as the frustum of a cone of infinite height.)

Figure 9.10.3

The area of a frustum.

Now we are ready to approximate the area of a surface of revolution. On one subinterval, the situation is as shown in figure 9.10.4. When the line joining two points on the

9.10

curve is rotated around the x-axis, it forms a frustum of a cone. The area is
2πrh = 2π

f (xi ) + f (xi+1 ) √
1 + (f ′ (ti ))2 ∆x.
2

√
Here 1 + (f ′ (ti ))2 ∆x is the length of the line segment, as we found in the previous
section. Assuming f is a continuous function, there must be some x∗i in [xi , xi+1 ] such
that (f (xi ) + f (xi+1 ))/2 = f (x∗i ), so the approximation for the surface area is
n−1
∑

√
2πf (x∗i ) 1 + (f ′ (ti ))2 ∆x.

i=0

This is not quite the sort of sum we have seen before, as it contains two diﬀerent values
in the interval [xi , xi+1 ], namely x∗i and ti . Nevertheless, using more advanced techniques
than we have available here, it turns out that

values in [xi , xi+1 ], they get closer and closer to each other as the length of the interval
shrinks.)

Polar Coordinates,
Parametric Equations

10.1

Polar Coordinates

Coordinate systems are tools that let us use algebraic methods to understand geometry.
While the rectangular (also called Cartesian) coordinates that we have been using are
the most common, some problems are easier to analyze in alternate coordinate systems.
A coordinate system is a scheme that allows us to identify any point in the plane or
in three-dimensional space by a set of numbers. In rectangular coordinates these numbers
are interpreted, roughly speaking, as the lengths of the sides of a rectangle. In polar
coordinates a point in the plane is identified by a pair of numbers (r, θ). The number θ
measures the angle between the positive x-axis and a ray that goes through the point, as
shown in figure 10.1.1; the number r measures the distance from the origin to the point.
√
Figure 10.1.1 shows the point with rectangular coordinates (1, 3) and polar coordinates
(2, π/3), 2 units from the origin and π/3 radians from the positive x-axis.

240 Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations
Just as we describe curves in the plane using equations involving x and y, so can we
describe curves using equations involving r and θ. Most common are equations of the form
r = f (θ).
EXAMPLE 10.1.1 Graph the curve given by r = 2. All points with r = 2 are at
distance 2 from the origin, so r = 2 describes the circle of radius 2 with center at the
origin.
EXAMPLE 10.1.2 Graph the curve given by r = 1 + cos θ. We first consider y =
1 + cos x, as in figure 10.1.2. As θ goes through the values in [0, 2π], the value of r tracks
the value of y, forming the “cardioid” shape of figure 10.1.2. For example, when θ = π/2,
r = 1 + cos(π/2) = 1, so we graph the point at distance 1 from the origin along the
positive y-axis, which is at an angle of π/2 from the positive x-axis. When θ = 7π/4,
√
r = 1 + cos(7π/4) = 1 + 2/2 ≈ 1.71, and the corresponding point appears in the fourth
quadrant. This illustrates one of the potential benefits of using polar coordinates: the
equation for this curve in rectangular coordinates would be quite complicated.

A cardioid: y = 1 + cos x on the left, r = 1 + cos θ on the right.

Each point in the plane is associated with exactly one pair of numbers in the rectangular coordinate system; each point is associated with an infinite number of pairs in
polar coordinates. In the cardioid example, we considered only the range 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π,
and already there was a duplicate: (2, 0) and (2, 2π) are the same point. Indeed, every
value of θ outside the interval [0, 2π) duplicates a point on the curve r = 1 + cos θ when
0 ≤ θ < 2π. We can even make sense of polar coordinates like (−2, π/4): go to the direction π/4 and then move a distance 2 in the opposite direction; see figure 10.1.3. As usual,
a negative angle θ means an angle measured clockwise from the positive x-axis. The point
in figure 10.1.3 also has coordinates (2, 5π/4) and (2, −3π/4).
The relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates is quite easy to understand. The point with polar coordinates (r, θ) has rectangular coordinates x = r cos θ
and y = r sin θ; this follows immediately from the definition of the sine and cosine functions. Using figure 10.1.3 as an example, the point shown has rectangular coordinates

x = (−2) cos(π/4) = − 2 ≈ 1.4142 and y = (−2) sin(π/4) = − 2. This makes it very
easy to convert equations from rectangular to polar coordinates.

EXAMPLE 10.1.4 Find the equation of the circle (x − 1/2)2 + y 2 = 1/4 in polar
coordinates. Again substituting: (r cos θ − 1/2)2 + r2 sin2 θ = 1/4. A bit of algebra turns
this into r = cos(t). You should try plotting a few (r, θ) values to convince yourself that
this makes sense.
EXAMPLE 10.1.5 Graph the polar equation r = θ. Here the distance from the origin
exactly matches the angle, so a bit of thought makes it clear that when θ ≥ 0 we get the
spiral of Archimedes in figure 10.1.4. When θ < 0, r is also negative, and so the full graph
is the right hand picture in the figure.

The spiral of Archimedes and the full graph of r = θ.

Converting polar equations to rectangular equations can be somewhat trickier, and
graphing polar equations directly is also not always easy.

242 Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations
EXAMPLE 10.1.6 Graph r = 2 sin θ. Because the sine is periodic, we know that we
will get the entire curve for values of θ in [0, 2π). As θ runs from 0 to π/2, r increases
from 0 to 2. Then as θ continues to π, r decreases again to 0. When θ runs from π to
2π, r is negative, and it is not hard to see that the first part of the curve is simply traced
out again, so in fact we get the whole curve for values of θ in [0, π). Thus, the curve looks
something like figure 10.1.5. Now, this suggests that the curve could possibly be a circle,
and if it is, it would have to be the circle x2 + (y − 1)2 = 1. Having made this guess, we
can easily check it. First we substitute for x and y to get (r cos θ)2 + (r sin θ − 1)2 = 1;
expanding and simplifying does indeed turn this into r = 2 sin θ.

Slopes in polar coordinates

When we describe a curve using polar coordinates, it is still a curve in the x-y plane. We
would like to be able to compute slopes and areas for these curves using polar coordinates.
We have seen that x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ describe the relationship between polar
and rectangular coordinates. If in turn we are interested in a curve given by r = f (θ),
then we can write x = f (θ) cos θ and y = f (θ) sin θ, describing x and y in terms of θ alone.
The first of these equations describes θ implicitly in terms of x, so using the chain rule we
may compute
dy
dy dθ
=

dθ dx
Since dθ/dx = 1/(dx/dθ), we can instead compute
dy

f (θ) cos θ + f ′ (θ) sin θ

−f (θ) sin θ + f ′ (θ) cos θ
EXAMPLE 10.2.1 Find the points at which the curve given by r = 1 + cos θ has a
vertical or horizontal tangent line. Since this function has period 2π, we may restrict our
attention to the interval [0, 2π) or (−π, π], as convenience dictates. First, we compute the
slope:
dy
(1 + cos θ) cos θ − sin θ sin θ
cos θ + cos2 θ − sin2 θ
=
=
.
dx
−(1 + cos θ) sin θ − sin θ cos θ
− sin θ − 2 sin θ cos θ
This fraction is zero when the numerator is zero (and the denominator is not zero). The
numerator is 2 cos2 θ + cos θ − 1 so by the quadratic formula
√
−1 ± 1 + 4 · 2
1
cos θ =
= −1 or
.
4
2
This means θ is π or ±π/3. However, when θ = π, the denominator is also 0, so we cannot
conclude that the tangent line is horizontal.
Setting the denominator to zero we get
− sin θ − 2 sin θ cos θ = 0
sin θ(1 + 2 cos θ) = 0,
so either sin θ = 0 or cos θ = −1/2. The first is true when θ is 0 or π, the second when θ
is 2π/3 or 4π/3. However, as above, when θ = π, the numerator is also 0, so we cannot

244 Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations
conclude that the tangent line is vertical. Figure 10.2.1 shows points corresponding to θ
equal to 0, ±π/3, 2π/3 and 4π/3 on the graph of the function. Note that when θ = π the
curve hits the origin and does not have a tangent line.

We know that the second derivative f ′′ (x) is useful in describing functions, namely,
in describing concavity. We can compute f ′′ (x) in terms of polar coordinates as well. We
already know how to write dy/dx = y ′ in terms of θ, then

The ellipsis here represents rather a substantial amount of algebra. We know from above
that the cardioid has horizontal tangents at ±π/3; substituting these values into the second

derivative we get y ′′ (π/3) = − 3/2 and y ′′ (−π/3) = 3/2, indicating concave down and
concave up respectively. This agrees with the graph of the function.

Areas in polar coordinates

We can use the equation of a curve in polar coordinates to compute some areas bounded
by such curves. The basic approach is the same as with any application of integration: find
an approximation that approaches the true value. For areas in rectangular coordinates, we
approximated the region using rectangles; in polar coordinates, we use sectors of circles,
as depicted in figure 10.3.1. Recall that the area of a sector of a circle is αr2 /2, where
α is the angle subtended by the sector. If the curve is given by r = f (θ), and the angle
subtended by a small sector is ∆θ, the area is (∆θ)(f (θ))2 /2. Thus we approximate the
total area as
n−1
∑1
f (θi )2 ∆θ.

This example makes the process appear more straightforward than it is. Because
points have many diﬀerent representations in polar coordinates, it is not always so easy to
identify points of intersection.
EXAMPLE 10.3.3 We find the shaded area in the first graph of figure 10.3.3 as the
diﬀerence of the other two shaded areas. The cardioid is r = 1 + sin θ and the circle is
r = 3 sin θ. We attempt to find points of intersection:
1 + sin θ = 3 sin θ
1 = 2 sin θ
1/2 = sin θ.
This has solutions θ = π/6 and 5π/6; π/6 corresponds to the intersection in the first quadrant that we need. Note that no solution of this equation corresponds to the intersection

Parametric Equations

When we computed the derivative dy/dx using polar coordinates, we used the expressions
x = f (θ) cos θ and y = f (θ) sin θ. These two equations completely specify the curve,
though the form r = f (θ) is simpler. The expanded form has the virtue that it can easily
be generalized to describe a wider range of curves than can be specified in rectangular or
polar coordinates.
Suppose f (t) and g(t) are functions. Then the equations x = f (t) and y = g(t)
describe a curve in the plane. In the case of the polar coordinates equations, the variable
t is replaced by θ which has a natural geometric interpretation. But t in general is simply
an arbitrary variable, often called in this case a parameter, and this method of specifying
a curve is known as parametric equations. One important interpretation of t is time.
In this interpretation, the equations x = f (t) and y = g(t) give the position of an object
at time t.

10.4

Parametric Equations

249

EXAMPLE 10.4.1 Describe the path of an object that moves so that its position at
time t is given by x = cos t, y = cos2 t. We see immediately that y = x2 , so the path lies
on this parabola. The path is not the entire parabola, however, since x = cos t is always
between −1 and 1. It is now easy to see that the object oscillates back and forth on the
parabola between the endpoints (1, 1) and (−1, 1), and is at point (1, 1) at time t = 0.
It is sometimes quite easy to describe a complicated path in parametric equations
when rectangular and polar coordinate expressions are diﬃcult or impossible to devise.
EXAMPLE 10.4.2 A wheel of radius 1 rolls along a straight line, say the x-axis. A
point on the rim of the wheel will trace out a curve, called a cycloid. Assume the point
starts at the origin; find parametric equations for the curve.
Figure 10.4.1 illustrates the generation of the curve (click on the AP link to see an
animation). The wheel is shown at its starting point, and again after it has rolled through
about 490 degrees. We take as our parameter t the angle through which the wheel has
turned, measured as shown clockwise from the line connecting the center of the wheel
to the ground. Because the radius is 1, the center of the wheel has coordinates (t, 1).
We seek to write the coordinates of the point on the rim as (t + ∆x, 1 + ∆y), where
∆x and ∆y are as shown in figure 10.4.2. These values are nearly the sine and cosine
of the angle t, from the unit circle definition of sine and cosine. However, some care is
required because we are measuring t from a nonstandard starting line and in a clockwise
direction, as opposed to the usual counterclockwise direction. A bit of thought reveals
that ∆x = − sin t and ∆y = − cos t. Thus the parametric equations for the cycloid are
x = t − sin t, y = 1 − cos t.

x′ = 1 − cos t, y ′ = sin t, so
dy
sin t
=
.
dx
1 − cos t
Note that when t is an odd multiple of π, like π or 3π, this is (0/2) = 0, so there is
a horizontal tangent line, in agreement with figure 10.4.1. At even multiples of π, the
fraction is 0/0, which is undefined. The figure shows that there is no tangent line at such
points.
Areas can be a bit trickier with parametric equations, depending on the curve and the
area desired. We can potentially compute areas between the curve and the x-axis quite
easily.
EXAMPLE 10.5.2 Find the area under one arch of the cycloid x = t−sin t, y = 1−cos t.
We would like to compute
∫ 2π
y dx,
0

but we do not know y in terms of x. However, the parametric equations allow us to make
a substitution: use y = 1 − cos t to replace y, and compute dx = (1 − cos t) dt. Then the
integral becomes
∫ 2π
(1 − cos t)(1 − cos t) dt = 3π.
0

252 Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations
Note that we need to convert the original x limits to t limits using x = t − sin t. When
x = 0, t = sin t, which happens only when t = 0. Likewise, when x = 2π, t − 2π = sin t
and t = 2π. Alternately, because we understand how the cycloid is produced, we can see
directly that one arch is generated by 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. In general, of course, the t limits will
be diﬀerent than the x limits.
This technique will allow us to compute some quite interesting areas, as illustrated by
the exercises.
As a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given by parametric
equations. Section 9.9 investigates arc length for functions given as y in terms of x, and
develops the formula for length:
√
( )2
∫ b

Using some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can convert this to use
parametric equations x = f (t), y = g(t):

Here u and v are the t limits corresponding to the x limits a and b.
EXAMPLE 10.5.3 Find the length of one arch of the cycloid. From x = t − sin t,
y = 1 − cos t, we get the derivatives f ′ = 1 − cos t and g ′ = sin t, so the length is

Since 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π, sin(t/2) ≥ 0, so we can rewrite this as
∫ 2π
2 sin(t/2) dt = 8.

to unwind it, we get a piece of the involute, until the string is vertical. If we then keep the
string taut and continue to rotate it counter-clockwise, the end traces out a semi-circle with
center at (−1, 0), until the string is vertical again. Continuing, the end of the string traces

The dots at the end indicate that the sum goes on forever. Does this make sense? Can
we assign a numerical value to an infinite sum? While at first it may seem diﬃcult or
impossible, we have certainly done something similar when we talked about one quantity
getting “closer and closer” to a fixed quantity. Here we could ask whether, as we add more
and more terms, the sum gets closer and closer to some fixed value. That is, look at

Sequences

While the idea of a sequence of numbers, a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . is straightforward, it is useful to
think of a sequence as a function. We have up until now dealt with functions whose domains
are the real numbers, or a subset of the real numbers, like f (x) = sin x. A sequence is a
function with domain the natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} or the non-negative integers,
Z≥0 = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}. The range of the function is still allowed to be the real numbers; in
symbols, we say that a sequence is a function f : N → R. Sequences are written in a few
diﬀerent ways, all equivalent; these all mean the same thing:
a1 , a2 , a3 , . . .
∞

{an }n=1
∞

{f (n)}n=1
As with functions on the real numbers, we will most often encounter sequences that
can be expressed by a formula. We have already seen the sequence ai = f (i) = 1 − 1/2i ,

11.1

Sequences

257

and others are easy to come by:
i
i+1
1
f (n) = n
2
f (n) = sin(nπ/6)
f (i) =

f (i) =

(i − 1)(i + 2)
2i

Frequently these formulas will make sense if thought of either as functions with domain R
or N, though occasionally one will make sense only for integer values.
Faced with a sequence we are interested in the limit
lim f (i) = lim ai .

i→∞

i→∞

We already understand
lim f (x)

x→∞

when x is a real valued variable; now we simply want to restrict the “input” values to be
integers. No real diﬀerence is required in the definition of limit, except that we specify, perhaps implicitly, that the variable is an integer. Compare this definition to definition 4.10.4.
DEFINITION 11.1.1

∞

Suppose that {an }n=1 is a sequence. We say that lim an = L
n→∞

if for every ϵ > 0 there is an N > 0 so that whenever n > N , |an − L| < ϵ. If lim an = L
n→∞

we say that the sequence converges, otherwise it diverges.
If f (i) defines a sequence, and f (x) makes sense, and lim f (x) = L, then it is clear
x→∞

that lim f (i) = L as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement
i→∞

is not true. For example, since lim (1/x) = 0, it is clear that also lim (1/i) = 0, that is,
x→∞

i→∞

the numbers
1 1 1 1 1 1
, , , , , ,...
1 2 3 4 5 6
get closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let f (n) = sin(nπ). This is the sequence
sin(0π), sin(1π), sin(2π), sin(3π), . . . = 0, 0, 0, 0, . . .
since sin(nπ) = 0 when n is an integer. Thus lim f (n) = 0. But lim f (x), when x is
n→∞

x→∞

real, does not exist: as x gets bigger and bigger, the values sin(xπ) do not get closer and

258 Chapter 11 Sequences and Series
closer to a single value, but take on all values between −1 and 1 over and over. In general,
whenever you want to know lim f (n) you should first attempt to compute lim f (x),
n→∞

x→∞

since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason lim f (x)
x→∞

does not exist, it may still be true that lim f (n) exists, but you’ll have to figure out
n→∞

another way to compute it.
It is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is
defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 11.1.1 we see
the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.

EXAMPLE 11.1.10 A particularly common and useful sequence is {rn }∞
n=0 , for various
values of r. Some are quite easy to understand: If r = 1 the sequence converges to 1 since
every term is 1, and likewise if r = 0 the sequence converges to 0. If r = −1 this is
the sequence of example 11.1.7 and diverges. If r > 1 or r < −1 the terms rn get large
without limit, so the sequence diverges. If 0 < r < 1 then the sequence converges to 0.
If −1 < r < 0 then |rn | = |r|n and 0 < |r| < 1, so the sequence {|r|n }∞
n=0 converges to

−1 < r ≤ 1 in which case

1 if r = 1
Sometimes we will not be able to determine the limit of a sequence, but we still would
like to know whether it converges. In some cases we can determine this even without being
able to compute the limit.
A sequence is called increasing or sometimes strictly increasing if ai < ai+1 for
all i. It is called non-decreasing or sometimes (unfortunately) increasing if ai ≤ ai+1
for all i. Similarly a sequence is decreasing if ai > ai+1 for all i and non-increasing if
ai ≥ ai+1 for all i. If a sequence has any of these properties it is called monotonic.

is decreasing.
A sequence is bounded above if there is some number N such that an ≤ N for every
n, and bounded below if there is some number N such that an ≥ N for every n. If a
sequence is bounded above and bounded below it is bounded. If a sequence {an }∞
n=0 is
increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded below (by a0 ), and if it is decreasing or nonincreasing it is bounded above (by a0 ). Finally, with all this new terminology we can state
an important theorem.

11.1

THEOREM 11.1.12

261

Sequences

If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.

We will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to
believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the
one before, yet never larger than some fixed value N . The terms must then get closer and
closer to some value between a0 and N . It need not be N , since N may be a “too-generous”
upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms ai .
EXAMPLE 11.1.13 All of the terms (2i − 1)/2i are less than 2, and the sequence is
increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1—1 is the smallest number that
is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms (n + 1)/n are bigger
than 1/2, and the limit is 1—1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the
sequence.
We don’t actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem—
it is enough to know that the sequence is “eventually” monotonic, that is, that at some
point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4,
3/4, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32, . . . is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not.
But starting with the term 3/4 it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence
3/4, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32, . . . converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as
n gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can’t turn a convergent sequence into a
divergent one.
EXAMPLE 11.1.14

Show that {n1/n } converges.

We first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that n1/n > (n+1)1/(n+1) . Consider
the real function f (x) = x1/x when x ≥ 1. We can compute the derivative, f ′ (x) =
x1/x (1−ln x)/x2 , and note that when x ≥ 3 this is negative. Since the function has negative
slope, n1/n > (n + 1)1/(n+1) when n ≥ 3. Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the
sequence is decreasing and bounded when n ≥ 3, and so the sequence converges. (As it
happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without
knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)
EXAMPLE 11.1.15

Show that {n!/nn } converges.

Again we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is positive the sequence
converges. We can’t take the derivative this time, as x! doesn’t make sense for x real. But
we note that if an+1 /an < 1 then an+1 < an , which is what we want to know. So we look
at an+1 /an :

11.2

Series

While much more can be said about sequences, we now turn to our principal interest,
series. Recall that a series, roughly speaking, is the sum of a sequence: if {an }∞
n=0 is a
sequence then the associated series is
∞
∑

an = a0 + a1 + a2 + · · ·

i=0

Associated with a series is a second sequence, called the sequence of partial sums
{sn }∞
n=0 :
n
∑
sn =
ai .
i=0

So
s0 = a0 ,

s1 = a0 + a1 ,

s2 = a0 + a1 + a2 ,

...

A series converges if the sequence of partial sums converges, and otherwise the series
diverges.
EXAMPLE 11.2.1

n

If an = kx ,

∞
∑

an is called a geometric series. A typical partial

n=0

sum is
sn = k + kx + kx2 + kx3 + · · · + kxn = k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn ).

11.2

Series

263

We note that
sn (1 − x) = k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn )(1 − x)
= k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn )1 − k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn−1 + xn )x
= k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn − x − x2 − x3 − · · · − xn − xn+1 )
= k(1 − xn+1 )
so
sn (1 − x) = k(1 − xn+1 )
sn = k

In general, the sequence of partial sums sn is harder to understand and analyze than
the sequence of terms an , and it is diﬃcult to determine whether series converge and if so
to what. Sometimes things are relatively simple, starting with the following.
THEOREM 11.2.3
Proof.

Since

But
sn − sn−1 = (a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + an ) − (a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + an−1 ) = an ,

n→∞

This theorem presents an easy divergence test: if given a series

an the limit lim an

does not exist or has a value other than zero, the series diverges. Note well that the

so it might be reasonable to speculate that the series converges to something in the neighborhood of 10. But in fact the partial sums do go to infinity; they just get big very, very

and so on. By swallowing up more and more terms we can always manage to add at least

The Integral Test

It is generally quite diﬃcult, often impossible, to determine the value of a series exactly.
In many cases it is possible at least to determine whether or not the series converges, and
so we will spend most of our time on this problem.
If all of the terms an in a series are non-negative, then clearly the sequence of partial
sums sn is non-decreasing. This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial
sums is bounded, the series must converge. We know that if the series converges, the
terms an approach zero, but this does not mean that an ≥ an+1 for every n. Many useful
and interesting series do have this property, however, and they are among the easiest to
understand. Let’s look at an example.
EXAMPLE 11.3.1

n=1

The terms 1/n2 are positive and decreasing, and since lim 1/x2 = 0, the terms 1/n2
x→∞

approach zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to
find a number N so that sn ≤ N for every n. The upper bound is provided courtesy of
integration, and is inherent in figure 11.3.1.
The figure shows the graph of y = 1/x2 together with some rectangles that lie completely below the curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the
rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are 1/12 ,
1/22 , 1/32 , and so on—in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum
sn is simply the sum of the areas of the first n rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie
between the curve and the x-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding

area under the curve, and so of course any sum of rectangle areas is less than the area
under the entire curve, that is, all the way to infinity. There is a bit of trouble at the left
end, where there is an asymptote, but we can work around that easily. Here it is:

recalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of
partial sums sn is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that lim sn = L < 2, and
n→∞

so the series converges to some number less than 2. In fact, it is possible, though diﬃcult,
to show that L = π 2 /6 ≈ 1.6.
∑
We already know that
1/n diverges. What goes wrong if we try to apply this
technique to it? Here’s the calculation:

The problem is that the improper integral doesn’t converge. Note well that this does

not prove that
1/n diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it

converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that
1/n
diverges.
EXAMPLE 11.3.2 Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.
The rectangles this time are above the curve, that is, each rectangle completely contains
the corresponding area under the curve. This means that

As n gets bigger, ln(n + 1) goes to infinity, so the sequence of partial sums sn must also

So these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges
or prove that it diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known
as the integral test, which we state as a theorem.
THEOREM 11.3.3

Suppose that f (x) > 0 and is decreasing on the infinite interval

The two examples we have seen are called p-series; a p-series is any series of the form
1/np . If p ≤ 0, lim 1/np ̸= 0, so the series diverges. For positive values of p we can
n→∞

determine precisely which series converge.
THEOREM 11.3.4
Proof.

A p-series with p > 0 converges if and only if p > 1.

We use the integral test; we have already done p = 1, so assume that p ̸= 1.

Since it is typically diﬃcult to compute the value of a series exactly, a good approximation is frequently required. In a real sense, a good approximation is only as good as
we know it is, that is, while an approximation may in fact be good, it is only valuable in
practice if we can guarantee its accuracy to some degree. This guarantee is usually easy
to come by for series with decreasing positive terms.
EXAMPLE 11.3.8

Approximate

∑

1/n2 to two decimal places.

Referring to figure 11.3.1, if we approximate the sum by

N
∑

1/n2 , the error we make is

n=1

the total area of the remaining rectangles, all of which lie under the curve 1/x2 from x = N
out to infinity. So we know the true value of the series is larger than the approximation,
and no bigger than the approximation plus the area under the curve from N to infinity.
Roughly, then, we need to find N so that
∫

∞

dx < 1/100.
x2

270 Chapter 11 Sequences and Series
We can compute the integral:

∫

∞

N

N

so N = 100 is a good starting point. Adding up the first 100 terms gives approximately
1.634983900, and that plus 1/100 is 1.644983900, so approximating the series by the value
halfway between these will be at most 1/200 = 0.005 in error. The midpoint is 1.639983900,
but while this is correct to ±0.005, we can’t tell if the correct two-decimal approximation
is 1.63 or 1.64. We need to make N big enough to reduce the guaranteed error, perhaps to
around 0.004 to be safe, so we would need 1/N ≈ 0.008, or N = 125. Now the sum of the
first 125 terms is approximately 1.636965982, and that plus 0.008 is 1.644965982 and the
point halfway between them is 1.640965982. The true value is then 1.640965982±0.004, and
all numbers in this range round to 1.64, so 1.64 is correct to two decimal places. We have
mentioned that the true value of this series can be shown to be π 2 /6 ≈ 1.644934068 which
rounds down to 1.64 (just barely) and is indeed below the upper bound of 1.644965982,
again just barely. Frequently approximations will be even better than the “guaranteed”
accuracy, but not always, as this example demonstrates.

Alternating Series

Alternating Series

Next we consider series with both positive and negative terms, but in a regular pattern:
they alternate, as in the alternating harmonic series for example:
∞
∑
(−1)n−1
1 −1 1 −1
1 1 1 1
= +
+ +
+ ··· = − + − + ···.
n

4

n=1

In this series the sizes of the terms decrease, that is, |an | forms a decreasing sequence,
but this is not required in an alternating series. As with positive term series, however,
when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in
fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating
harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms an are decreasing,
the partial sums s1 , s3 , s5 , and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below
by s2 , so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the partial sums s2 , s4 , s6 , and so on,
form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by s1 , so this sequence also converges.
Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and
since the “jumps” (that is, the ai terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences
must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums s1 , s2 , s3 , . . .
converges as well.

The alternating harmonic series.

There’s nothing special about the alternating harmonic series—the same argument
works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms. The alternating series test
is worth calling a theorem.
Suppose that {an }∞
n=1 is a non-increasing sequence of positive
∞
∑
numbers and lim an = 0. Then the alternating series
(−1)n−1 an converges.

THEOREM 11.4.1
n→∞

n=1

Proof. The odd numbered partial sums, s1 , s3 , s5 , and so on, form a non-increasing
sequence, because s2k+3 = s2k+1 − a2k+2 + a2k+3 ≤ s2k+1 , since a2k+2 ≥ a2k+3 . This

272 Chapter 11 Sequences and Series
sequence is bounded below by s2 , so it must converge, say lim s2k+1 = L. Likewise,
k→∞

the partial sums s2 , s4 , s6 , and so on, form a non-decreasing sequence that is bounded
above by s1 , so this sequence also converges, say lim s2k = M . Since lim an = 0 and
n→∞

k→∞

s2k+1 = s2k + a2k+1 ,
L = lim s2k+1 = lim (s2k + a2k+1 ) = lim s2k + lim a2k+1 = M + 0 = M,
k→∞

k→∞

k→∞

k→∞

so L = M , the two sequences of partial sums converge to the same limit, and this means
the entire sequence of partial sums also converges to L.
Another useful fact is implicit in this discussion. Suppose that
∞
∑

L=

(−1)n−1 an

n=1

and that we approximate L by a finite part of this sum, say
L≈

N
∑

(−1)n−1 an .

n=1

Because the terms are decreasing in size, we know that the true value of L must be between
this approximation and the next one, that is, between

and

n=1

N

∑

(−1)n−1 an .

Depending on whether N is odd or even, the second will be larger or smaller than the first.
EXAMPLE 11.4.2 Approximate the alternating harmonic series to one decimal place.
We need to go roughly to the point at which the next term to be added or subtracted
is 1/10. Adding up the first nine and the first ten terms we get approximately 0.746 and
0.646. These are 1/10 apart, but it is not clear how the correct value would be rounded. It
turns out that we are able to settle the question by computing the sums of the first eleven
and twelve terms, which give 0.737 and 0.653, so correct to one place the value is 0.7.
We have considered alternating series with first index 1, and in which the first term is
positive, but a little thought shows this is not crucial. The same test applies to any similar

that it must converge, because the terms we are adding are smaller than the terms of a

Since the p-series converges, say to L, and since the terms are positive, tn < L. Since the
terms of the new series are positive, the sn form an increasing sequence and sn < tn < L
for all n. Hence the sequence {sn } is bounded and so converges.

274 Chapter 11 Sequences and Series
Sometimes, even when the integral test applies, comparison to a known series is easier,
so it’s generally a good idea to think about doing a comparison before doing the integral
test.
EXAMPLE 11.5.2

Does

We can’t apply the integral test here, because the terms of this series are not decreasing.

because | sin n| ≤ 1. Once again the partial sums are non-decreasing and bounded above
∑

1/n2 = L, so the new series converges.
Like the integral test, the comparison test can be used to show both convergence and
divergence. In the case of the integral test, a single calculation will confirm whichever is
the case. To use the comparison test we must first have a good idea as to convergence or
divergence and pick the sequence for comparison accordingly.
EXAMPLE 11.5.3

We observe that the −3 should have little eﬀect compared to the n2 inside the square

should diverge. We attempt to show this by comparison to the harmonic series. We note

So the general approach is this: If you believe that a new series is convergent, attempt
to find a convergent series whose terms are larger than the terms of the new series; if you
believe that a new series is divergent, attempt to find a divergent series whose terms are
smaller than the terms of the new series.

Absolute Convergence

∑
Roughly speaking there are two ways for a series to converge: As in the case of
1/n2 ,
the individual terms get small very quickly, so that the sum of all of them stays finite, or,
∑
∑
as in the case of
(−1)n−1 /n, the terms don’t get small fast enough ( 1/n diverges),
but a mixture of positive and negative terms provides enough cancellation to keep the
sum finite. You might guess from what we’ve seen that if the terms get small fast enough
to do the job, then whether or not some terms are negative and some positive the series
converges.
THEOREM 11.6.1

If

∞
∑

|an | converges, then

Proof.

an converges.

converges by theorem 11.2.2.
∑
So given a series
an with both positive and negative terms, you should first ask
∑
whether
|an | converges. This may be an easier question to answer, because we have
∑
tests that apply specifically to series with non-negative terms. If
|an | converges then
∑
∑
you know that
an converges as well. If
|an | diverges then it still may be true that
∑
an converges—you will have to do more work to decide the question. Another way to
∑
∑
think of this result is: it is (potentially) easier for
an to converge than for
|an | to
converge, because the latter series cannot take advantage of cancellation.
∑
∑
∑
If |an | converges we say that an converges absolutely; to say that an converges
absolutely is to say that any cancellation that happens to come along is not really needed,
as the terms already get small so fast that convergence is guaranteed by that alone. If
∑
∑

an converges but
|an | does not, we say that

n→∞

so to apply the alternating series test we need to know whether the terms are decreasing.
If we let f (x) = (3x + 4)/(2x2 + 3x + 5) then f ′ (x) = −(6x2 + 16x − 3)/(2x2 + 3x + 5)2 ,
and it is not hard to see that this is negative for x ≥ 1, so the series is decreasing and by
the alternating series test it converges.

converge? It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this

with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what
happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:
··· +

n5
(n + 1)5
+
+ ···
5n
5n+1

The denominator goes up by a factor of 5, 5n+1 = 5 · 5n , but the numerator goes up by
much less: (n + 1)5 = n5 + 5n4 + 10n3 + 10n2 + 5n + 1, which is much less than 5n5 when
n is large, because 5n4 is much less than n5 . So we might guess that in the long run it

278 Chapter 11 Sequences and Series
begins to look as if each term is 1/5 of the previous term. We have seen series that behave
like this:
∞
∑
5

n=0
a geometric series. So we might try comparing the given series to some variation of this
geometric series. This is possible, but a bit messy. We can in eﬀect do the same thing,
but bypass most of the unpleasant work.
The key is to notice that

This is really just what we noticed above, done a bit more oﬃcially: in the long run, each
term is one fifth of the previous term. Now pick some number between 1/5 and 1, say 1/2.
Because

an+1

lim
n→∞ an

then when n is big enough, say n ≥ N for some N ,
an+1

and an+1 <

So aN +1 < aN /2, aN +2 < aN +1 /2 < aN /4, aN +3 < aN +2 /2 < aN +1 /4 < aN /8, and so
on. The general form is aN +k < aN /2k . So if we look at the series
∞
∑

aN +k = aN + aN +1 + aN +2 + aN +3 + · · · + aN +k + · · · ,

k=0

its terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence

So by the comparison test,

∑
k=0

aN +k converges, and this means that

∞
∑

an converges,

n=0

since we’ve just added the fixed number a0 + a1 + · · · + aN −1 .
Under what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of
an+1 /an , say L, was less than 1 so that we could pick a value r so that L < r < 1. The
∑
fact that L < r (1/5 < 1/2 in our example) means that we can compare the series
an
∑ n
∑ n
to
r , and the fact that r < 1 guarantees that
r converges. That’s really all that is

11.7

The Ratio and Root Tests

279

required to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the
series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we
end up testing for absolute convergence.
THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test
Suppose that lim |an+1 /an | = L. If L < 1
n→∞
∑
the series
an converges absolutely, if L > 1 the series diverges, and if L = 1 this test
gives no information.
Proof. The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace
1/5 by L and 1/2 by r. Suppose that L > 1, and pick r so that 1 < r < L. Then for
n ≥ N , for some N ,
|an+1 |
> r and |an+1 | > r|an |.
|an |
This implies that |aN +k | > rk |aN |, but since r > 1 this means that lim |aN +k | ̸= 0, which
k→∞

means also that lim an ̸= 0. By the divergence test, the series diverges.
n→∞

To see that we get no information when L = 1, we need to exhibit two series with
∑
∑
L = 1, one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that
1/n2 and
1/n
do the job.

Since 0 < 1, the series converges.
A similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally
easier to apply.
THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test
Suppose that lim |an |1/n = L. If L < 1 the
n→∞
∑
series
an converges absolutely, if L > 1 the series diverges, and if L = 1 this test gives
no information.
The proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good
exercise.

if |x| < 1, and that the series diverges when |x| ≥ 1. At the time, we thought of x as an

is a function, namely, the function k/(1 − x), as long as |x| < 1. While k/(1 − x) is a rea∑ n
sonably easy function to deal with, the more complicated
kx does have its attractions:
it appears to be an infinite version of one of the simplest function types—a polynomial.
This leads naturally to the questions: Do other functions have representations as series?
Is there an advantage to viewing them in this way?
The geometric series has a special feature that makes it unlike a typical polynomial—
the coeﬃcients of the powers of x are the same, namely k. We will need to allow more
general coeﬃcients if we are to get anything other than the geometric series.

Thus when |x| < 1 the series converges and when |x| > 1 it diverges, leaving only two values
in doubt. When x = 1 the series is the harmonic series and diverges; when x = −1 it is the
alternating harmonic series (actually the negative of the usual alternating harmonic series)

and converges. Thus, we may think of
as a function from the interval [−1, 1) to
n

the real numbers.
A bit of thought reveals that the ratio test applied to a power series will always have
the same nice form. In general, we will compute

assuming that lim |an+1 |/|an | exists. Then the series converges if L|x| < 1, that is, if
|x| < 1/L, and diverges if |x| > 1/L. Only the two values x = ±1/L require further

282 Chapter 11 Sequences and Series
investigation. Thus the series will definitely define a function on the interval (−1/L, 1/L),
and perhaps will extend to one or both endpoints as well. Two special cases deserve
mention: if L = 0 the limit is 0 no matter what value x takes, so the series converges for
all x and the function is defined for all real numbers. If L = ∞, then no matter what
value x takes the limit is infinite and the series converges only when x = 0. The value 1/L
is called the radius of convergence of the series, and the interval on which the series
converges is the interval of convergence.
Consider again the geometric series,

xn =

Whatever benefits there might be in using the series form of this function are only available to us when x is between −1 and 1. Frequently we can address this shortcoming by

the same function as before. For what values of x does this series converge? Since it is a
geometric series, we know that it converges when
|x + 2|/3 < 1
|x + 2| < 3
−3 < x + 2 < 3
−5 < x < 1.
So we have a series representation for 1/(1 − x) that works on a larger interval than before,
at the expense of a somewhat more complicated series. The endpoints of the interval of
convergence now are −5 and 1, but note that they can be more compactly described as
−2 ± 3. We say that 3 is the radius of convergence, and we now say that the series is
centered at −2.

Calculus with Power Series

Now we know that some functions can be expressed as power series, which look like infinite
polynomials. Since calculus, that is, computation of derivatives and antiderivatives, is easy
for polynomials, the obvious question is whether the same is true for infinite series. The
answer is yes:

or 1 − x = 2. The interval of convergence is [−1, 1), or 0 < 1 − x ≤ 2, so we can use the
series to represent ln(x) when 0 < x ≤ 2. For example
ln(3/2) = ln(1 − −1/2) =

is between 909/2240 and 909/2240 − 1/2048 = 29053/71680 ≈ .4053, so correct to two
decimal places the value is 0.41.
What about ln(9/4)? Since 9/4 is larger than 2 we cannot use the series directly, but
ln(9/4) = ln((3/2)2 ) = 2 ln(3/2) ≈ 0.82,
so in fact we get a lot more from this one calculation than first meets the eye. To estimate
the true value accurately we actually need to be a bit more careful. When we multiply by
two we know that the true value is between 0.8106 and 0.812, so rounded to two decimal
places the true value is 0.81.

So if a function f can be represented by a series, we know just what series it is. Given
a function f , the series

is called the Maclaurin series for f .
EXAMPLE 11.10.1 Find the Maclaurin series for f (x) = 1/(1 − x). We need to
compute the derivatives of f (and hope to spot a pattern).
f (x) = (1 − x)−1
f ′ (x) = (1 − x)−2
f ′′ (x) = 2(1 − x)−3
f ′′′ (x) = 6(1 − x)−4
f (4) (x) = 4!(1 − x)−5

.
f (n) (x) = n!(1 − x)−n−1

the geometric series.
A warning is in order here. Given a function f we may be able to compute the
Maclaurin series, but that does not mean we have found a series representation for f . We
still need to know where the series converges, and if, where it converges, it converges to
f (x). While for most commonly encountered functions the Maclaurin series does indeed
converge to f on some interval, this is not true of all functions, so care is required.
As a practical matter, if we are interested in using a series to approximate a function,
we will need some finite number of terms of the series. Even for functions with messy
derivatives we can compute these using computer software like Sage. If we want to know the
whole series, that is, a typical term in the series, we need a function whose derivatives fall
into a pattern that we can discern. A few of the most important functions are fortunately
very easy.

EXAMPLE 11.10.2 Find the Maclaurin series for sin x.
The derivatives are quite easy: f ′ (x) = cos x, f ′′ (x) = − sin x, f ′′′ (x) = − cos x,
f (4) (x) = sin x, and then the pattern repeats. We want to know the derivatives at zero: 1,
0, −1, 0, 1, 0, −1, 0,. . . , and so the Maclaurin series is

|x|2
= 0,
=
lim
n→∞ (2n + 3)! |x|2n+1
n→∞ (2n + 3)(2n + 2)
lim

so the series converges for every x. Since it turns out that this series does indeed converge
to sin x everywhere, we have a series representation for sin x for every x. Here is an
interactive plot of the sine and some of its series approximations.
Sometimes the formula for the nth derivative of a function f is diﬃcult to discover,
but a combination of a known Maclaurin series and some algebraic manipulation leads
easily to the Maclaurin series for f .
EXAMPLE 11.10.3 Find the Maclaurin series for x sin(−x).
To get from sin x to x sin(−x) we substitute −x for x and then multiply by x. We can
do the same thing to the series for sin x:

As we have seen, a general power series can be centered at a point other than zero,
and the method that produces the Maclaurin series can also produce such series.

Taylor's Theorem

One of the most important uses of infinite series is the potential for using an initial portion
of the series for f to approximate f . We have seen, for example, that when we add up the
first n terms of an alternating series with decreasing terms that the diﬀerence between this
and the true value is at most the size of the next term. A similar result is true of many
Taylor series.
THEOREM 11.11.1 Suppose that f is defined on some open interval I around a and
suppose f (N +1) (x) exists on this interval. Then for each x ̸= a in I there is a value z
between x and a so that

Taylor’s Theorem

289

Proof. The proof requires some cleverness to set up, but then the details are quite
elementary. We want to define a function F (t). Start with the equation

F (t) =

N
∑
f (n) (t)
(x − t)n + B(x − t)N +1 .
n!
n=0

Here we have replaced a by t in the first N + 1 terms of the Taylor series, and added a
carefully chosen term on the end, with B to be determined. Note that we are temporarily
keeping x fixed, so the only variable in this equation is t, and we will be interested only in
t between a and x. Now substitute t = a:
N
∑
f (n) (a)
F (a) =
(x − a)n + B(x − a)N +1 .
n!
n=0

Set this equal to f (x):

f (x) =

N
∑
f (n) (a)
(x − a)n + B(x − a)N +1 .
n!
n=0

Since x ̸= a, we can solve this for B, which is a “constant”—it depends on x and a but
those are temporarily fixed. Now we have defined a function F (t) with the property that
F (a) = f (x). Consider also F (x): all terms with a positive power of (x − t) become zero
when we substitute x for t, so we are left with F (x) = f (0) (x)/0! = f (x). So F (t) is a
function with the same value on the endpoints of the interval [a, x]. By Rolle’s theorem
(6.5.1), we know that there is a value z ∈ (a, x) such that F ′ (z) = 0. Let’s look at F ′ (t).
Each term in F (t), except the first term and the extra term involving B, is a product, so
to take the derivative we use the product rule on each of these terms. It will help to write
out the first few terms of the definition:
f (1) (t)
f (2) (t)
f (3) (t)
(x − t)1 +
(x − t)2 +
(x − t)3 + · · ·

What can we say about the size of the term

(N + 1)!
Every derivative of sin x is ± sin x or ± cos x, so |f (N +1) (z)| ≤ 1. The factor (x − a)N +1 is
a bit more diﬃcult, since x − a could be quite large. Let’s pick a = 0 and |x| ≤ π/2; if we
can compute sin x for x ∈ [−π/2, π/2], we can of course compute sin x for all x.
We need to pick N so that
xN +1
< 0.005.

Since we have limited x to [−π/2, π/2],

The quantity on the right decreases with increasing N , so all we need to do is find an N

gets larger, the approximation heads to negative infinity very quickly, since it is essentially
acting like −x7 .

that is, the sine function is actually equal to its Maclaurin series for all x. How can we
prove that the limit is zero? Suppose that N is larger than |x|, and let M be the largest
integer less than |x| (if M = 0 the following is even easier). Then

as desired. Essentially the same argument works for cos x and ex ; unfortunately, it is more
diﬃcult to show that most functions are equal to their Maclaurin series.

since f (n) (x) = ex for all n. We are interested in x near 2, and we need to keep |(x−2)N +1 |
in check, so we may as well specify that |x − 2| ≤ 1, so x ∈ [1, 3]. Also
e3
ez

so we need to find an N that makes e3 /(N + 1)! ≤ 0.005. This time N = 5 makes
e3 /(N + 1)! < 0.0015, so the approximating polynomial is
ex = e2 + e2 (x − 2) +

This presents an additional problem for approximation, since we also need to approximate
e2 , and any approximation we use will increase the error, but we will not pursue this
complication.
Note well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain accuracy only on
a small interval, even though the series for sin x and ex converge for all x; this is typical.
To get the same accuracy on a larger interval would require more terms.

Algebra
Remember that the common algebraic operations have precedences relative to each other:
for example, multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction, but
are “tied” with each other. In the case of ties, work left to right. This means, for example,
that 1/2x means (1/2)x: do the division, then the multiplication in left to right order. It
sometimes is a good idea to use more parentheses than strictly necessary, for clarity, but
it is also a bad idea to use too many parentheses.
