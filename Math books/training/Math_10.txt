Preface
Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology

approaches geometry

through the lens of questions that have ignited the imagination of stargazers
since antiquity. What is the shape of the universe? Does the universe have an
edge? Is it innitely big?
This text develops non-Euclidean geometry and geometry on surfaces
at a level appropriate for undergraduate students who have completed a
multivariable calculus course and are ready for a course in which to practice
the habits of thought needed in advanced courses of the undergraduate
mathematics curriculum. The text is also suited to independent study, with
essays and discussions throughout.
Mathematicians and cosmologists have expended considerable amounts of
eort investigating the shape of the universe, and this eld of research is called
cosmic topology. Geometry plays a fundamental role in this research. Under
basic assumptions about the nature of space, there is a simple relationship
between the geometry of the universe and its shape, and there are just three
possibilities for the type of geometry: hyperbolic geometry, elliptic geometry,
and Euclidean geometry. These are the geometries we study in this text.
Chapters 2 through 7 contain the core mathematical content.

The text

follows the Erlangen Program, which develops geometry in terms of a space and
a group of transformations of that space. Chapter 2 focuses on the complex
plane, the space on which we build two-dimensional geometry.

Chapter 3

details transformations of the plane, including MÃ¶bius transformations. This
chapter marks the heart of the text, and the inversions in Section 3.2 mark
the heart of the chapter.
are built from inversions.

All non-Euclidean transformations in the text
We formally dene geometry in Chapter 4, and

pursue hyperbolic and elliptc geometry in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively.
Chapter 7 begins by extending these geometries to dierent curvature scales.
Section 7.4 presents a unied family of geometries on all curvature scales,
emphasizing key results common to them all. Section 7.5 provides an informal
development of the topology of surfaces, and Section 7.6 relates the topology of
surfaces to geometry, culminating with the Gauss-Bonnet formula. Section 7.7
discusses quotient spaces, and presents an important tool of cosmic topology,
the Dirichlet domain.
Two longer essays bookend the core content.

Chapter 1 introduces the

geometric perspective taken in this text. In my experience it is very helpful
to spend time discussing this content in class. The Coneland and Saddleland
activities (Example 1.3.5 and Example 1.3.7) have proven particularly helpful
for motivating the content of the text. In Chapter 8, after having developed
two-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry and the topology of surfaces, we
glance meaningfully at the present state of research in cosmic topology. Section
8.1 oers a brief survey of three-dimensional geometry and 3-manifolds, which

iii

iv

provide possible shapes of the universe.

Sections 8.2 and 8.3 present two

research programs in cosmic topology: cosmic crystallography and circles-inthe-sky.

Measurements taken and analyzed over the last twenty years have

greatly altered the way many cosmologists view the universe, and the text ends
with a discussion of our present understanding of the state of the universe.
Compass and ruler constructions play a visible role in the text, primarily
because inversions are emphasized as the basic building blocks of transformations.

Constructions are used in some proofs (such as the Fundamental

Theorem of MÃ¶bius Transformations) and as a guide to denitions (such as
the arc-length dierential in the hyperbolic plane). We encourage readers to
practice constructions as they read along, either with compass and ruler on
paper, or with software such as

Changes from the previously published version

For those familiar with

the oringial version of the text published by Jones & Bartlett, we note a few
changes in the current edition. First, the numbering scheme has changed, so
Example and Theorem and Figure numbers will not match the old hard copy.
Of course the numbering schemes on the website and the new print options
of the text do agree. Second, several exercises have been added. In sections
with additional exercises, the new ones typically appear at the end of the
section.

Finally, Chapter 7 has been reorganized in an eort to place more

emphasis on the family

(Xk , Gk ),

and the key theorems common to all these

geometries. This family now receives its own section, Section 7.4. The previous
Section 7.4 (Observing Curvature in a Universe) has been folded into Section
7.3. Finally, the essays in Chapter 8 on cosmic topology and our understanding
of the universe have been updated to include research done since the original
publication of this text, some of which is due to sharper measurements of the
temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained with the
launch of the Planck satellite in 2009.

Introduction

Imagine you are a two-dimensional being living in a two-dimensional universe.
Mathematicians in this universe often represent its shape as an innite plane,
exactly like the

xy -plane

you've used as the canvas in your calculus courses.

Your two-dimensional self has been taught in geometry that the angles of

â¦

any triangle sum to 180 . You may have even constructed some triangles to
check. Builders use the Pythagorean theorem to check whether two walls meet
at right angles, and houses are sturdy.

a, b, and c and check whether a2 + b2 = c2 .

If equality

holds, the corner is square!

The innite plane model of the two-dimensional universe works well enough
for most purposes, but cosmologists and mathematicians, who notice that
everything within the universe is nite, consider the possibility that the
universe itself is nite.

Would a nite universe have a boundary?

have an edge, a point beyond which one cannot travel?

1

This possibility is

2

unappealing because a boundary point would be physically dierent from the
rest of space. But how can a nite universe have no boundary?
In a stroke as bold as it is simple, a two-dimensional mathematician suggests
that the universe looks like a rectangular region with opposite edges identied.
Consider a at, two-dimensional rectangle. In fact, visualize a tablet screen.
Now imagine that you are playing a video game called Asteroids. As you shoot
the asteroids and move your ship around the screen, you nd that if you go o
the top of the screen your ship reappears on the bottom; and if you go o the
screen to the left you reappear on the right. In Figure 1.1.2 there are just ve
asteroids. One has partially moved o the top of the screen and reappeared
below, while a second is half way o the right hand edge and is reappearing
to the left.

Figure 1.1.2:

A nite two-dimensional world with no boundary.

Thus, the top edge of the rectangle has been identied, point by point,
with the bottom edge.

In three dimensions one can physically achieve this

identication, or gluing, of the edges. In particular, one can bend the rectangle
to produce a cylinder, being careful to join only the top and bottom edges
together, and not any other points. The left and right edges of the rectangle
have now become the left and right circles of the cylinder, which themselves
get identied, point by point. Bend the cylinder to achieve this second gluing,
and one obtains a donut, also called a torus.

Figure 1.1.3:

The video screen in Figure 1.1.2 is equivalent to a torus.

Of course your two-dimensional self would not be able to see this torus
surface in 3-space, but you could understand the space perfectly well in its
rectangle-with-edges-identied form. It is clearly a nite area universe without
any edge.
A sphere, like the surface of a beach ball, is another nite area twodimensional surface without any edge. A bug cruising around on the surface
of a sphere will observe that locally the world looks like a at plane, and that
the surface has no edges.
Consideration of a nite-area universe leads to questions about the type
of geometry that applies to the universe.

Let's look at a sphere.

On small

scales Euclidean geometry works well enough: small triangles have angle sum

â¦

essentially equal to 180 , which is a dening feature of Euclidean geometry.
But on a larger scale, things go awry.

A very large triangle drawn on the

â¦

surface of the sphere has an angle sum far exceeding 180 . (By triangle, we

1.2.

A Brief History of Geometry

3

mean three points on the surface, together with three paths of shortest distance
between the points. We'll discuss this more carefully later.)
Consider the triangle formed by the north pole and two points on the

â¦

equator in Figure 1.1.4. The angle at each point on the equator is 90 , so the
total angle sum of the triangle exceeds 180

â¦

by the amount of the angle at the

north pole. We conclude that a non-Euclidean geometry applies to the sphere
on a global scale.

Figure 1.1.4:

A triangle on a sphere.

In fact, there is a wonderful relationship between the topology (shape) of
a surface, and the type of geometry that it inherits, and a primary goal of
this book is to arrive at this relationship, given by the pristine Gauss-Bonnet
equation

kA = 2ÏÏ.
We won't explain this equation here, but we will point out that geometry
is on the left side of the equation, and topology is on the right. So, if a twodimensional being can deduce what sort of global geometry holds in her world,
she can greatly reduce the possible shapes for her universe.

Our immediate

task in the text is to study the other, non-Euclidean types of geometry that
may apply on surfaces.

1.2

A Brief History of Geometry

Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, and most important
among texts is Euclid's

Elements.

His text begins with 23 denitions, 5

postulates, and 5 common notions. From there Euclid starts proving results
about geometry using a rigorous logical method, and many of us have been
asked to do the same in high school.
Euclid's

Elements

served as

the text on geometry for over 2000 years, and it

has been admired as a brilliant work in logical reasoning. But one of Euclid's
ve postulates was also the center of a hot debate.

It was this debate that

ultimately led to the non-Euclidean geometries that can be applied to dierent
surfaces.
Here are Euclid's ve postulates:
1. One can draw a straight line from any point to any point.
2. One can produce a nite straight line continuously in a straight line.
3. One can describe a circle with any center and radius.
4. All right angles equal one another.
5. If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles
on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if
produced indenitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less
than two right angles.

4

1. An Invitation to Geometry

Does one postulate not look like the others? The rst four postulates are
short, simple, and intuitive. Well, the second might seem a bit odd, but all
Euclid is saying here is that you can produce a line segment to any length you
want.

However, the 5th one, called the

parallel postulate , is not short or

simple; it sounds more like something you would try to prove than something
you would take as given.
Indeed, the parallel postulate immediately gave philosophers and other
thinkers ts, and many tried to prove that the fth postulate followed from
the rst four, to no avail. Euclid himself may have been bothered at some level
by the parallel postulate since he avoids using it until the proof of the 29th
proposition in his text.
In

trying

to

make

sense

of

the

parallel

postulate,

many

equivalent

statements emerged. The two equivalent statements most relevant to our study
are these:

5 . Given a line and a point not on the line, there is exactly one
line through the point that does not intersect the given line.

500 .

The sum of the angles of any triangle is 180 .

Playfair's Axiom

after the

This version of the fth

postulate will be the one we alter in order to produce non-Euclidean geometry.
The parallel postulate debate came to a head in the early 19th century.
Farkas Bolyai (1775-1856) of Hungary spent much of his life on the problem
of trying to prove the parallel postulate from the other four. He failed, and
he fretted when his son JÃ¡nos (1802-1860) started following down the same
tormented path. In an oft-quoted letter, the father begged the son to end the
obsession:
For God's sake, I beseech you, give it up. Fear it no less than the
sensual passions because it too may take all your time and deprive
you of your health, peace of mind and happiness in life.

1

But JÃ¡nos continued to work on the problem, as did the Russian mathematician
Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792-1856). They independently discovered that a welldened geometry is possible in which the rst four postulates hold, but the
fth doesn't. In particular, they demonstrated that the fth postulate

a necessary consequence

is not

of the rst four.

In this text we will study two types of non-Euclidean geometry.

The

rst type is called hyperbolic geometry, and is the geometry that Bolyai and
Lobachevsky discovered.

(The great Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) had

also discovered this geometry; however, he did not publish his work because
he feared it would be too controversial for the establishment.) In hyperbolic
geometry, Euclid's fth postulate is replaced by this:
5H. Given a line and a point not on the line, there are

at least two

lines through the point that do not intersect the given line.

â¦

In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the angles of any triangle is less than 180 ,
a fact we prove in Chapter 5.
The second type of non-Euclidean geometry in this text is called elliptic
geometry, which models geometry on the sphere.

In this geometry, Euclid's

fth postulate is replaced by this:

zero

lines

through the point that do not intersect the given line.

â¦

In elliptic geometry, the sum of the angles of any triangle is greater than 180 ,
a fact we prove in Chapter 6.

The Pythagorean Theorem

The celebrated Pythagorean theorem depends

upon the parallel postulate, so it is a theorem of Euclidean geometry. However,
we will encounter non-Euclidean variations of this theorem in Chapters 5 and 6,
and present a unied Pythagorean theorem in Chapter 7, with Theorem 7.4.7,
a result that appeared recently in [20].
The Pythagorean theorem appears as Proposition 47 at the end of Book I
of Euclid's

Elements,

and we present Euclid's proof below. The Pythagorean

theorem is fundamental to the systems of measurement we utilize in this text,
in both Euclidean and non-Eucidean geometries. We also remark that the nal
proposition of Book I, Proposition 48, gives the converse that builders use: If
we measure the legs of a triangle and nd that
opposite

c is right.

AB and DE , respectively. One can check that âKAB is congruent to
âCAD. Moreover, the area of âKAB is one half the area of the square AH .
This is the case because they have equal base (segment KA) and equal altitude
(segment AC ). By a similar argument, the area of âDAC is one half the area
of the parallelogram AM . This means that square AH and parallelogram AM

have equal areas, the value of which is b .
One may proceed as above to argue that the areas of square BG and
2
parallelogram BM are also equal, with value a . Since the area of square
BD, which equals c2 , is the sum of the two parallelogram areas, it follows that
a2 + b2 = c2 .

The arrival of non-Euclidean geometry soon caused a stir in circles outside
the mathematics community.

Fyodor Dostoevsky thought non-Euclidean

geometry was interesting enough to include in

The Brothers Karamazov,

rst

published in 1880. Early in the novel two of the brothers, Ivan and Alyosha, get
reacquainted at a tavern. Ivan discourages his younger brother from thinking
about whether God exists, arguing that if one cannot fathom non-Euclidean
geometry, then one has no hope of understanding questions about God.

2

One of the rst challenges of non-Euclidean geometry was to determine
its logical consistency. By changing Euclid's parallel postulate, was a system
created that led to contradictory theorems? In 1868, the Italian mathematician
Enrico Beltrami (1835-1900) showed that the new non-Euclidean geometry
could be constructed within the Euclidean plane so that, as long as Euclidean

geometry was consistent, non-Euclidean geometry would be consistent as well.
Non-Euclidean geometry was thus placed on solid ground.
This text does not develop geometry as Euclid, Lobachevsky, and Bolyai
did. Instead, we will approach the subject as the German mathematician Felix
Klein (1849-1925) did.
Whereas Euclid's approach to geometry was additive (he started with
basic denitions and axioms and proceeded to build a sequence of results
depending on previous ones), Klein's approach was subtractive.

He started

with a space and a group of allowable transformations of that space.

He

then threw out all concepts that did not remain unchanged under these
transformations.

Geometry, to Klein, is the study of objects and functions

that remain unchanged under allowable transformations.
Klein's approach to geometry, called the

Erlangen Program

after the

university at which he worked at the time, has the benet that all three
geometries (Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic) emerge as special cases from
a general space and a general set of transformations.
The next three chapters will be devoted to making sense of and working
through the preceding two paragraphs.
Like so much of mathematics, the development of non-Euclidean geometry anticipated applications.

Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity

illustrates the power of Klein's approach to geometry. Special relativity, says
Einstein, is derived from the notion that the laws of nature are invariant with

Even with non-Euclidean geometry in hand, Euclidean geometry remains

Even galactic triangles determined by the positions of three nearby stars have

However, on a larger scale, things might be dierent.
Maybe we live in a universe that looks at (i.e., Euclidean) on smallish
scales but is curved globally. This is not so hard to believe. A bug living in
a eld on the surface of the Earth might reasonably conclude he is living on
an innite plane.

The bug cannot sense the fact that his at, visible world

is just a small patch of a curved surface (Earth) living in three-dimensional
space.

Likewise, our apparently Euclidean three-dimensional universe might

Euclidean geometry are the only three possibilities for the global geometry of
our universe. Researchers have spent signicant time poring over cosmological
data in hopes of deciding which geometry is ours. Deducing the geometry of
the universe can tell us much about the shape of the universe and perhaps
whether it is nite. If the universe is elliptic, then it must be nite in volume.
If it is Euclidean or hyperbolic, then it can be either nite or innite. Moreover,
each geometry type corresponds to a class of possible shapes. And, if that isn't
exciting enough, the overall geometry of the universe may be fundamentally
connected to the fate of the universe. Clearly there is no more grand application
of geometry than to the fate of the universe!

Geometry on Surfaces: A First Look

Think for a minute about the space we live in. Think about objects that live
in our space. Do the features of objects change when they move around in our
space? If I pick up this paper and move it across the room, will it shrink? Will
it become a broom?
If you draw a triangle on this page, the angles of the triangle will add

â¦

to 180 . In fact,

any

triangle drawn

anywhere

on the page has this property.

Euclidean geometry on this at page (a portion of the plane) is

homogeneous :

the local geometry of the plane is the same at all points. Our three-dimensional
space appears to be homogeneous as well. This is nice, for it means that if we

3

buy a 5 ft

freezer at the appliance store, it doesn't shrink to 0.5 ft

when we

get it home. A sphere is another example of a homogenous surface. A twodimensional bug living on the surface of a sphere could not tell the dierence
(geometrically) between any two points on the sphere.
The surface of a donut in three-dimensional space (see Figure 1.3.1) is not
homogeneous, and a two-dimensional bug living on this surface

could

tell the

dierence between various points. One approach to discovering dierences in
geometry involves triangles.

In Figure 1.3.3 we have drawn geodesic triangles on three dierent

surfaces.

Figure 1.3.3:

Depending on the shape of the surface, geodesic triangles can

â¦

have angle sum greater than, less than, or equal to 180 .

Getting back to the donut, a two-dimensional bug could use triangles to
tell the dierence between a convex point on an outer wall, and a saddleshaped point on an inner wall (see Figure 1.3.1). A bug could draw a triangle
about the convex point, determine the angle sum, and then move around the
surface to a saddle-shaped point, and determine the angle sum of a new triangle
(whose legs are the same length as before). The bug would scratch her head at
the dierent angle sums before realizing she'd stumbled upon something big.

1.3.

She'd go home, write up the result, emphasizing the fact that a triangle in the

â¦

rst convex region will have angle sum greater than 180 , while a triangle

â¦

in the saddle-shaped region will have angle sum less than 180 . This happy
bug will conclude her donut surface is not homogeneous. She will then sit back
and watch the accolades pour in.

Perhaps even a Nobel prize.

Thus, small

triangles and their angles can help a two-dimensional bug distinguish points
on a surface.
The donut surface is not homogeneous, so let's build one that is.

This world is called a

at

At every spot in this world, the pilot of the ship would report at

surroundings (triangle angles add to 180 ). Unlike the donut surface
living in three dimensions, the at torus

is

homogeneous.

Locally,

geometry is the same at every point, and thanks to a triangle check,
this geometry is Euclidean. But the world as a whole is much dierent
than the Euclidean plane. For instance, if the pilot of the ship has a
powerful enough telescope, he'd be able to see the back of his ship. Of
course, if the ship had windows just so, he'd be able to see the back
of his head. The at torus is a nite, Euclidean two-dimensional world
without any boundary.

Here we build cones from at wedges, and measure angles of some
triangles.

The Complex Plane
To study geometry using Klein's Erlangen Program, we need to dene a space
and a group of transformations of the space. Our space will be the complex
plane.

i to the set R of real numbers, where i is dened by the property that i2 = â1.

Addition in C is componentwise,
(x, y) + (s, t) = (x + s, y + t),

and if

is a real number, we dene

scalar multiplication by

k Â· (x, y) = (kx, ky).
Within this framework,

x + yi

i = (0, 1), meaning that any complex number (x, y)
as suggested here:

(x, y) = (x, 0) + (0, y)
= x(1, 0) + y(0, 1)
= x + yi.
The expression

x+yi is called the Cartesian

form of the complex number.

This form can be helpful when doing arithmetic of complex numbers, but it
can also be a bit gangly. We often let a single letter such as

Polar Form of a Complex Number

A point

(x, y)

in the plane can be represented in polar form

(r, Î¸)

according to

the relationships in Figure 2.2.1.

(x, y)
r
Î¸

Figure 2.2.1:

x = r cos(Î¸)
y = r sin(Î¸)

Polar coordinates of a point in the plane

Using these relationships, we can rewrite

x + yi = r cos(Î¸) + r sin(Î¸)i
= r(cos(Î¸) + i sin(Î¸)).
This leads us to make the following denition. For any real number

Î¸,

we

dene

eiÎ¸ = cos(Î¸) + i sin(Î¸).
eiÏ/2 = cos(Ï/2) + i sin(Ï/2) = 0 + i Â· 1 = i.
e = cos(0) + i sin(0) = 1, and it's a quick check

For instance,
Similarly,

to see that

eiÏ = â1, which leads to a simple equation involving the most famous numbers
in mathematics (except 8), truly an all-star equation:

eiÏ + 1 = 0.
z = x + yi and (x, y) has polar form (r, Î¸) then z = reiÎ¸ is called
polar form of z. The non-negative scalar |r| is the modulus of z, and
angle Î¸ is called the argument of z , denoted arg(z ).

Theorem 2.2.3. The product of two complex numbers in polar form is given
by

reiÎ¸ Â· seiÎ² = (rs)ei(Î¸+Î²) .

Proof.

We use the denition of the complex exponential and some

trigonometric identities.

reiÎ¸ Â· seiÎ² = r(cos Î¸ + i sin Î¸) Â· s(cos Î² + i sin Î²)
= (rs)(cos Î¸ + i sin Î¸) Â· (cos Î² + i sin Î²)
= rs[cos Î¸ cos Î² â sin Î¸ sin Î² + (cos Î¸ sin Î² + sin Î¸ cos Î²)i]
= rs[cos(Î¸ + Î²) + sin(Î¸ + Î²)i]
= rs[ei(Î¸+Î²) ].
Thus, the product of two complex numbers is obtained by multiplying their
magnitudes and adding their arguments, and

arg(zw) = arg(z) + arg(w),

arg(vw) = arg(v) + arg(w) + 2Ïk for some integer

Angle Measure

Given two rays L1 and L2 having common initial point, we

2. The Complex Plane

Example 2.4.1: Line equations.

ax + by + d = 0. This line may be expressed via the complex variable
z = x + yi. For an arbitrary complex number Î² = s + ti, note that

It follows that the line

ax + by + d = 0

can be represented by the

equation

d,

the

equation

Î±z + Î±z + d = 0
determines a line in

C.

We may also view any line in

C

as the collection of points equidistant from

two given points.

Theorem 2.4.2. Any line in C can be expressed by the equation |zâÎ³| = |zâÎ²|

for suitably chosen points Î³ and Î² in C, and the set of all points (Euclidean)
equidistant from distinct points Î³ and Î² forms a line.
Proof.

Given two points

|z â Î³|2 = |z â Î²|2 .

Î³

and

Î²

in

C, z

is equidistant from both if and

Expanding this equation, we obtain

(z â Î³)(z â Î³) = (z â Î²)(z â Î²)
2

|z| â Î³z â Î³z + |Î³|2 = |z|2 â Î²z â Î²z + |Î²|2
(Î² â Î³)z + (Î² â Î³)z + (|Î³|2 â |Î²|2 ) = 0.
This last equation has the form of a line,

letting

Î± = (Î² â Î³)

and

Î³

that

d = |Î³|2 â |Î²|2 .
Conversely, starting with a line we can nd complex numbers

and

Î²

do the trick. In particular, if the given line is the perpendicular bisector of the
segment

Î³Î² ,

then

|z â Î³| = |z â Î²|

describes the line. We leave the details to

the reader.

To solve this equation

we rst rewrite it as

We use the quadratic formula with

Î³ = â(2 â 3i),

(x + yi) = 8 + 6i

x â y 2 + 2xyi = 8 + 6i.
Thus, we have two equations and two unknowns:

2xy = 6.

2. The Complex Plane

In fact, we also know that

|8 + 6i| = 10,

x2 + y 2 = |x + yi|2 = |(x + yi)2 | =

giving us a third equation

x2 + y 2 = 10.

(3)

x2 = 9 so x = Â±3. Substituting
x = 3 into equation (2) yields y = 1; substituting x = â3 into (2) yields
y = â1. Thus we have two solutions:

We may also use the polar form to determine

a function

one-to-one (or 1-1) if whenever a1 6= a2 in A, then f (a1 ) 6= f (a2 ) in B . The
function f is called onto if for any b in B there exists an element a in A such
that f (a) = b. A transformation on a set A is a function T : A â A that is
one-to-one and onto.

For instance, the origin gets moved to the point

the same direction. It follows that two dierent points, such as

the function is one-to-one). Also, any point in the plane is the image

That Tb is one-to-one :

Tb (z1 ) 6= Tb (z2 ). We do so by proving the contrapositive. Recall,

Tb (z1 ) = Tb (z2 ), then z1 = z2 . We now prove this statement.
Suppose z1 and z2 are two complex numbers such that Tb (z1 ) =

In other words, the desired rotation

R is the composition Tz0 â¦RÎ¸ â¦Tâz0

and

R(z) = eiÎ¸ (z â z0 ) + z0 .
That the composition of these three transformations is itself a
transformation follows from the next theorem.

Theorem 3.1.5. If

T and S are two transformations of the set A, then the
composition S â¦ T is also a transformation of the set A.
Proof.

We must prove that

That S â¦ T is onto :

Sâ¦T :AâA

is 1-1 and onto.

c is in A. We must nd an element a in A such that S â¦ T (a) = c.
S is onto, there exists some element b in A such that S(b) = c.
Since T is onto, there exists some element a in A such that T (a) = b.
Then S â¦ T (a) = S(b) = c, and we have demonstrated that S â¦ T is onto.
That S â¦ T is 1-1 :

Suppose
Since

Again,

we prove the contrapositive.

In particular,

we show that if

S â¦ T (a1 ) = S â¦ T (a2 ) then a1 = a2 .
If S(T (a1 )) = S(T (a2 )) then T (a1 ) = T (a2 ) since S is 1-1.
And T (a1 ) = T (a2 ) implies that a1 = a2 since T is 1-1.
Therefore, S â¦ T is 1-1.

The transformation

k.
Indeed, if

z = x + yi,

T (z) = kx + kyi, and z and T (z) are
k > 1 then T stretches points

Given complex constants

a, b

with

a 6= 0

the map

T (z) = az + b

is called a

general linear tranformation . We show in the following example that such
a map is indeed a transformation of

 a 6= 0, z is a complex number).

Indeed, T ( (w â b)) = a Â·
a
a (w â b) + b = w. Thus, T is onto.
That T is one-to-one :
To show that T is 1-1 we show that if T (z1 ) = T (z2 ), then z1 = z2 .
If z1 and z2 are two complex numbers such that T (z1 ) = T (z2 ),
then az1 + b = az2 + b. By subtracting b from both sides we see that
az1 = az2 , and then dividing both sides by a (which we can do since
a 6= 0), we see that z1 = z2 . Thus, T is 1-1 as well as onto, and we
have proved T is a transformation.
Let

Note that dilations, rotations, and translations are all special types
of general linear transformations.

Now, given any z in C, let L be the line through z that is parallel to vector b

of L1 and L, and z2 the intersection of L2 and L, (see the gure). To reect
z about L1 we need to translate it along L twice by the vector z1 â z . Thus
r1 (z) = z + 2(z1 â z) = 2z1 â z .
Next, to reect r1 (z) about L2 , we need to translate it along L twice by

iS1 (z) = 1/z.

|p â m| Â· |p â n| = s2 â r2 .

(2)

By subtracting equation (2) from (1), we have

|p â q|2 â |q â n|2 = s2 â r2 ,
which factors as

(|p â q| â |q â n|)(|p â q| + |q â n|) = s2 â r2 .
Since

|p â q| â |q â n| = |p â m| and |p â q| + |q â n| = |p â n|, the result follows.

C2 centered at z1 through t is orthogonal to C . Furthermore, the center of C2 ,
z1 , lies on line L, so C2 is orthogonal to L. Let p and q be the two points at

Stereographic Projection

We close this section with a look at stereo-

oers a very useful way for us to think about the point

The

in 3-space that are one unit from the origin. That is,

S2 = {(a, b, c) â R3 | a2 + b2 + c2 = 1}.
We will usually refer to the unit 2-sphere as simply the sphere.

Stereo-

graphic projection of the sphere onto the extended plane is dened as follows.

d are complex constants. Such a function is called a MÃ¶bius transformation
ad â bc 6= 0. Transformations of this form are also called fractional linear
transformations. The complex number ad â bc is called the determinant of
T (z) = (az + b)/(cz + d), and is denoted as Det(T ).

Theorem 3.4.3. The composition of two MÃ¶bius transformations is again a
MÃ¶bius transformation.

Just as translations and rotations of the plane can be constructed from
reections across lines, the general MÃ¶bius transformation can be constructed
from inversions about clines.

Theorem 3.4.4. A transformation of

C+ is a MÃ¶bius transformation if and

only if it is the composition of an even number of inversions.
Proof.

We rst observe that any general linear transformation

T (z) = az +b

is the composition of an even number of inversions. Indeed, such a map is a
dilation and rotation followed by a translation. Rotations and translations are
each compositions of two reections (Theorem 3.1.17), and a dilation is the
composition of two inversions about concentric circles (Exericise 3.2.4). So, in
total, we have that

T (z) = az + b

is the composition of an even number of

inversions.
Now suppose

c = 0 then T

T

is the MÃ¶bius transformation

T (z) = (az + b)/(cz + d). If
T (z) = ad z + db , and

To prove the other direction, we show that if

T

inversions then it is a MÃ¶bius transformation. Then, if

T

any even number of inversions, it is the composition of half as many MÃ¶bius

Either the two lines of

they intersect, in which case we have a rotation about the point of intersection
(Theorem 3.1.17). In either case we have a MÃ¶bius transformation.
It follows that the composition of any even number of inversions yields a
MÃ¶bius transformation.

3. Transformations

With this xed point theorem in hand, we can now prove the Fundamental
Theorem of MÃ¶bius Transformations, which says that if we want to induce a
one-to-one and onto motion of the entire extended plane that sends my favorite
three points (z1 , z2 , z3 ) to your favorite three points (w1 , w2 , w3 ), as dramatized
below, then there is a MÃ¶bius transformation that will do the trick, and there's

only

one.

Theorem 3.4.8 Fundamental Theorem of MÃ¶bius Transformations.

C+ to any three distinct points of C+ .
z1 , z2 , and z3 are distinct points in C+ , and w1 , w2 , and w3

are distinct points in C . We show there exists a unique MÃ¶bius transformation
that maps zi 7â wi for i = 1, 2, 3. To start, we show there exists a map, built
from inversions, that maps z1 7â 1, z2 7â 0 and z3 7â â. We do so in the case
that z3 6= â. This special case is left to the exercises.
First, invert about any circle centered at z3 . This takes z3 to â as desired.

and dilate about the origin, (which keeps 0 and â xed) so that z1 moves
to 1. This process yields a composition of inversions that maps z1 7â 1,
z2 7â 0, and z3 7â â. However, this composition actually involves an odd

Theorem 3.4.12 Invariance of Cross Ratio. Suppose z0 , z1 , z2 , and z3 are
four distinct points in C+ , and T is any MÃ¶bius transformation. Then
(z0 , z1 ; z2 , z3 ) = (T (z0 ), T (z1 ); T (z2 ), T (z3 )).
Proof.

Let

map can be expressed as a cross ratio:

S â¦ T â1 (z) = (z, T (z1 ); T (z2 ), T (z3 )).
Plugging

T (z0 )

into this transformation, we see

S â¦ T â1 (T (z0 )) = (T (z0 ), T (z1 ); T (z2 ), T (z3 )).
On the other hand,

S â¦ T â1 (T (z0 )) = S(z0 ),

which equals

(z0 , z1 ; z2 , z3 ).

So we have proved that

(z0 , z1 ; z2 , z3 ) = (T (z0 ), T (z1 ); T (z2 ), T (z3 )).

From the original description of T we observe that the pole of the

that zâ , wâ , and the two xed points all lie on the same Euclidean line.

the angle Î¸ .

Geometry
Recall the two paragraphs from Section 1.2 that we intended to spend time
making sense of and working through:
Whereas Euclid's approach to geometry was additive (he started
with basic denitions and axioms and proceeded to build a sequence
of results depending on previous ones),
subtractive.

Klein's approach was

He started with a space and a group of allowable

transformations of that space. He then threw out all concepts that
did not remain unchanged under these transformations. Geometry,
to Klein,

is the study of objects and functions that remain

unchanged under allowable transformations.
Klein's approach to geometry, called the

Let's look at some examples now to help sort through these denitions.

Example 4.1.4: Finite group of rotations.
H = {R0 , RÏ/2 , RÏ , R3Ï/2 } consisting of four rotations
C about the origin (by 0, Ï/2, Ï , and 3Ï/2 radians). We observe rst
i0
that H forms a group. Since R0 (z) = e z = z , H contains the identity
transformation on C. The set also satises closure, and the reader
can check all possible compositions. For instance, R3Ï/2 â¦ RÏ = RÏ/2 .
Finally, the inverse of each transformation in H is again in H . Check
â1
â1
â1
that R0
= R0 , RÏ/2
= R3Ï/2 , RÏâ1 = RÏ , and R3Ï/2
= RÏ/2 . Thus,
H is a group and we may study the geometry (C, H). For instance, is
the circle C given by |z â i| = .5 congruent to the circle D given by
|z| = .5? Well, is there a transformation in H that maps C onto D?
No! The only four circles congruent to C are pictured below. These
are found by rotating C about the origin by 0, Ï/2, Ï , or 3Ï/2 radians,

Example 4.1.5: A two-element group.
Consider reection of C across the real axis, given by r(z) = z . Since
râ¦r is the identity map, the set G = {1, r} is a group of transformations
on C, and we may dene the geometry (C, G). Notice that while 3 + i
is congruent to 3 â i in this geometry, it is not congruent to â3 + i.
Also, the circle |z â 2i| = 1 is congruent to the circle |z + 2i| = 1 but
not the circle |z â 3i| = 1.

Example 4.1.6: Translational geometry.
Let

T

denote the group of translations in Example 4.1.2, and consider

the geometry

We call this geometry

translational geometry .

Which gures in Figure 4.1.7 are congruent in this geometry?
Remember, two gures are congruent if we can nd a transformation
that moves one gure on top of the other. Since our allowable moves
here are translations, we cannot change the radius of a circle (that's a
dilation), and we cannot rotate objects. So, in translational geometry
the only gures congruent in Figure 4.1.7 are

So our old-fashioned notion of distance goes

out the window in MÃ¶bius geometry.
We emphasize that angles

are preserved

in MÃ¶bius geometry, which is a

good thing. Why is this a good thing? Remember that in the distant past,
humanity set out looking for a geometry in which Euclid's rst 4 postulates
hold true, but the 5th one fails. The 4th postulate states that all right angles
equal one another. This means that if Ralph is holding a right angle over in
the corner, and Randy is holding one down the block somewhere, we ought to
be able to transform one onto the other and see that the angles are the same.
Transformations do not change angles.
Rather than pursue the very general MÃ¶bius geometry, we take the preceeding facts and apply them straight away to two of its special subgeometries,
hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry.

Hyperbolic Geometry
Hyperbolic geometry can be modelled in many dierent ways. We will focus
here on the PoincarÃ© disk model, developed by Henri PoincarÃ© (1854-1912)
in around 1880.

PoincarÃ© did remarkable work in mathematics, though he

was never actually a professor of mathematics. He was particularly interested
in the relationship between mathematics, physics, and psychology. He began
studying non-Euclidean geometry in detail after it appeared in his study of two
apparently unrelated disciplines: dierential equations and number theory.

1

PoincarÃ© took Klein's view that geometries are generated by sets and groups of
transformations on them. We consider a second model of hyperbolic geometry,
the upper half-plane model, in Section 5.5.

does indeed form a group of transformations, a fact that

is worked out in the exercises. Throughout this chapter the unit circle will be
called

the circle at innity , denoted by S1â . Of course, the circle at innity

is not included in the hyperbolic plane

D

but bounds it. The circle at innity

will be used extensively in our investigations. We note here that any MÃ¶bius

them a name.

But rotation about the origin is also the composition of two reections

about lines that intersect at the origin. Since any line through the origin meets
the unit circle at right angles, reection about such a line is a reection of the
hyperbolic plane, so rotation about the origin is the composition of two such
reections. We now prove the following general result.

Theorem 5.1.3. Any MÃ¶bius transformation in H is the composition of two
reections of the hyperbolic plane.
Proof.

Suppose

Since

T

sends the unit circle to itself, and

T sends z0â
1
to â. Furthermore, some point z1 on Sâ gets sent to the point 1.
â
If z0 = 0, then z0 = â, and T xes 0 and â. Then by Example 3.5.3,
iÎ¸
T (z) = re z is a dilation followed by a rotation. However, since T also sends D
MÃ¶bius transformations preserve symmetry points, it follows that

onto

D,

the dilation factor must be

r = 1.

So

T

is simply a rotation about the

origin, which is the composition of two hyperbolic reections about Euclidean
lines through the origin.
Now assume

T

In this case, by using

z0 , z0â ,

and

z1

as anchors, we

via two hyperbolic reections, as follows:

First, invert about a circle

C

orthogonal to

S1â

that sends

z0

to the origin.

Such a circle does indeed exist, and we will construct it now.

As in

C1 with diameter 0z0â . Let p be a point of intersection
1
â
of C1 and the unit circle Sâ . Construct the circle C through p centered at z0 .
â
1
1
Since â 0pz0 is right, Sâ is orthogonal to C , so inversion about C sends Sâ
â
to itself. Furthermore, since z0 gets sent to â and symmetry points must be
preserved, inversion in C sends z0 to 0.
â
Thus, the rst inversion takes z0 to 0 and z0 to â. To build T we must
also send z1 to 1. Note that inversion in circle C will have sent z1 to some
0
1
point z1 on the unit circle (since Sâ is sent to itself ). Now reect across the
0
0
line through the origin that bisects angle â 10z1 . This sends z1 to 1, sends
D to D, and leaves 0 and â xed. Composing these two inversions yields
â
a MÃ¶bius transformation that sends z0 to 0, z0 to â and z1 to 1. Since a

Figure 5.1.4, draw circle

MÃ¶bius transformation is uniquely determined by the image of three points,
this MÃ¶bius transformation is

T.

Notice that in proving Theorem 5.1.3 we proved the following useful fact.

Lemma 5.1.5. Given z0 in D and z1 on S1â there exists a transformation in
H that sends z0 to 0 and z1 to 1.

Therefore, one may view any transformation in

The Euclidean transformation group,

the transformations in

inversions about clines that intersect the unit circle at right angles.

This

this hyperbolic line is unique.
Which hyperbolic lines happen to be portions of Euclidean lines (instead

of Euclidean circles)? A Euclidean line intersects a circle at right angles if and
only if it goes through the center of the circle. Thus, the only hyperbolic lines
that also happen to be Euclidean lines are those that go through the origin.
One may also use a symmetric points argument to arrive at this last fact.

The next section develops a distance function for the hyperbolic plane. As
in Euclidean geometry, we want to be able to compute the distance between

not change under a transformation in

In this section we develop a notion of distance in the hyperbolic plane.

5. In the limit for small distances, hyperbolic distance should be proportional to Euclidean distance.
Perhaps the least obvious of the features listed is the last one. One theme
of this text is that locally, on small scales, non-Euclidean geometry behaves
much like Euclidean geometry.

A small segment in the hyperbolic plane is

approximated to the rst order by a Euclidean segment.

Small hyperbolic

triangles look like Euclidean triangles and hyperbolic angles correspond to
Euclidean angles; the hyperbolic distance formula will t with this theme.
To nd the distance function, start with a point's distance from the origin.
Given a point

z

in

D,

rotate about 0 so that

z

gets sent to the point

x = |z|

on the positive real axis.
We may nd a hyperbolic line

L

about which

x

gets reected to the origin.

Such a hyperbolic line is constructed in the proof of Theorem 5.1.3. Recall, the

L is on the circle centered at xâ (the point symmetric to x with respect
1
1
to to Sâ ) that goes through the points at which Sâ intersects the circle with
â
diameter 0x . Let x+h be a point near x on the positive real axis, and suppose
x + h gets inverted to the point w, as depicted in Figure 5.3.1. One can show

follows that the shortest path between any two points in

Corollary 5.3.10. The hyperbolic distance function is a metric on the
hyperbolic plane. In particular, for any points p, q, u in D
1. dH (p, q) â¥ 0, and dH (p, q) = 0 if and only if p = q ;
2. dH (p, q) = dH (q, p); and
3. dH (p, q) + dH (q, u) â¥ dH (p, u).
Proof.

Recall our formula for the hyperbolic distance between two points

in Theorem 5.3.3:


dH (p, q) = ln


|1 â pq| + |q â p|
.
|1 â pq| â |q â p|

This expression is always non-negative because the quotient inside the
natural log is always greater than or equal to 1. In fact, the expression equals
1 (so that the distance equals 0) if and only if

p = q.

Note further that this formula is symmetric. Interchanging

p

and

q

leaves

the distance unchanged.
Finally, the hyperbolic distance formula satises the triangle inequality
because hyperbolic lines are geodesics.

triangle with hyperbolic side lengths a and b, and hypotenuse c,
cosh(c) = cosh(a) cosh(b).
The second hyperbolic law of cosines also leads to an interesting result. In

to, say, Euclidean geometry?
Recall what we know about hyperbolic geometry. First of all, any
two points in the hyperbolic plane are congruent, so the geometry

is

homogeneous. The pilot could not distinguish between any two points.
Second, the shortest path between two points is the hyperbolic
line between them, so light would travel along these hyperbolic lines,
assuming light follows geodesics. The pilot's line of sight would follow
along these lines, and the ship would move along these lines to y as
quickly as possible from

p to q ,

assuming no pesky asteroid elds block

the path. To observe a galaxy at point

the telescope.
With a well-dened metric, we can say more. The pilot will view
the hyperbolic plane as innite and without boundary. In theory, the
pilot can make an orbit of arbitrary radius about an asteroid located
anywhere in the space.
To test for hyperbolic geometry, perhaps the pilot can turn to
triangles. The angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane sum to less

circle at innity, the length of segment v4 v5 takes on all positive real values. So,

Example 5.4.21: Inscribe a circle in an ideal triangle.

The Upper Half-Plane Model

The PoincarÃ© disk model is one way to represent hyperbolic geometry, and for
most purposes it serves us very well. However, another model, called the upper
half-plane model, makes some computations easier, including the calculation
of the area of a triangle.

and

The PoincarÃ© disk model of hyperbolic geometry may be transferred to the
upper half-plane model via a MÃ¶bius transformation built from two inversions
as follows:

Since reection across the real axis leaves these image points xed, the

composition of the two inversions is a MÃ¶bius transformation that takes the
unit circle to the real axis. The map also sends the interior of the disk into

therefore, by Theorem 3.5.8, the map can be written as

This MÃ¶bius transformation is the key to transferring the disk model of
the hyperbolic plane to the upper half-plane model.

In fact, when treading

back and forth between these models it is convenient to adopt the following
convention for this section: Let
in the upper half-plane

U,

z

D,

and

denote a point

Elliptic Geometry
Elliptic geometry is the second type of non-Euclidean geometry that might
describe the geometry of the universe. In this chapter we focus our attention
on two-dimensional elliptic geometry, and the sphere will be our guide. The
chapter begins with a review of stereographic projection, and how this map is
used to transfer information about the sphere onto the extended plane.

We

develop elliptic geometry in Sections 6.2 and 6.3, and then pause our story
in Section 6.4 to reect on what we have established, geometry-wise, before
moving on to geometry on surfaces in Chapter 7.

To construct a great circle in the extended plane, it is enough to ensure
that it passes through one particular pair of antipodal points.

This can be

proved with the aid of stereographic projection, but an alternative proof is
given below, one that does not leave the plane, but rather uses a proposition
from Book III of Euclid's

Elements.

and suppose q is any other point on C . We show qa is also on C .
If C is a line, it must go through the origin since p and pa are on the same
line through the origin. Since q and qa are also on the same line through the
origin, if q is on C then qa is too.
If C is a circle, then the origin of the plane is in the interior of C and the
chord ppa contains the origin, as pictured in Figure 6.1.5. The line through q
and the origin intersects C at another point, say w . We show w = qa .

The intersecting chords theorem (Book III, Proposition 35 of Euclid's

applied to this gure tells us that

the proof to Exercise 6.1.7. The proof essentially follows that of Lemma 3.2.7,

The following theorem tells us that inversions will play a central role in
elliptic geometry, just as they do in hyperbolic geometry.

Theorem 6.1.6. Reection of S2 about a great circle corresponds via stereographic projection to inversion about a great circle in C+ .
We work through the relationship in one case, and refer the interested
reader to [10] for the general proof.

Example 6.1.7: Reection of S2 about the equator.
We argue that reection of

S2

about the equator corresponds to

inversion about the unit circle.
First of all, stereographic projection sends the equator of

We end the section with one more feature of the stereographic projection
map. The proof can be found in [10].

Theorem 6.1.8. The image of a circle on S2 via stereographic projection is a

cline in C+ . Moreover, the pre-image of a circle in C+ is a circle on S2 . The
pre-image of a line in C+ is a circle on S2 that goes through N = (0, 0, 1).

be represented as the intersection of S with a plane Ax+By +Cz +D = 0 in 32

these rotations should be in

So,

Let's run through this.

Example 6.2.2: Rotations about 0 are in S .
R(z) = eiÎ¸ z is a rotation about the origin and z and za are
antipodal points. If z = â or 0, then rotation about the origin xes z ,
and it also xes its antipodal point, so the map R preserves antipodal

In Exercise 3.5.8 we showed that any elliptic MÃ¶bius transformation is the
composition of two inversions about clines that intersect at the two xed points.
In the case of a MÃ¶bius transformation that preserves antipodal points, these
two xed points must be antipodal to each other. It follows by Lemma 6.1.4
that the two clines of inversion are great circles in

Thus, we may view each

as the composition of two inversions about great circles.

This is reassuring. By Theorem 6.1.6, these inversions correspond to reections
of the sphere about great circles, and composing two of these reections of
the sphere yields a rotation of the sphere.

The transformation group

S,

then, consists of MÃ¶bius transformations that correspond via stereographic

from the hyperbolic case.

This sign dierence is consistent with the sign

dierence in the algebraic descriptions of the transformations in the respective

Theorem 6.3.2. Arc-length is an invariant of elliptic geometry.

from which it follows that area is invariant.

One can also prove that the

shortest path between two points is along the elliptic line between them. That
is, geodesics follows elliptic lines.
However, one must be careful when measuring the shortest path between

Revisiting Euclid's Postulates

Without much fanfare, we have shown that the geometry

(P2 , S)

satises the

rst four of Euclid's postulates, but fails to satisfy the fth. This is also the
case with hyperbolic geometry

(D, H).

Moreover, the elliptic version of the

fth postulate diers from the hyperbolic version.

It is the purpose of this

section to provide the proper fanfare for these facts.
Recall Euclid's ve postulates:
1. One can draw a straight line from any point to any point.
2. One can produce a nite straight line continuously in a straight line.
3. One can describe a circle with any center and radius
4. All right angles equal one another.
5. Given a line and a point not on the line, there is exactly one line through
the point that does not intersect the given line.
That the rst postulate is satised in

(P2 , S)

is Theorem 6.2.11.

The second postulate holds here even though our elliptic space is nite. We
can extend line segments indenitely because the space has no boundary. If we
are at a point in the space, and decide to head o in a certain direction along
an elliptic straight line, we can walk for as long and far as we want (though we
would eventually return to our starting point and continue making laps along
the elliptic line).
The third postulate follows by a similar argument. In the previous section
we dened a circle about

any

point in

P2 .

And since we can walk an arbitrarily

6.4.

Revisiting Euclid's Postulates

129

long distance from any point, we can describe a circle of any radius about the
point.
The fourth postulate follows since MÃ¶bius transformations preserve angles
and the maps in

S

are special MÃ¶bius transformations.

The fth postulate fails because any two elliptic lines intersect (Theorem 6.2.13).

single line

Thus, given a line and a point not on the line, there is

not a

Recall that in our model of hyperbolic geometry,
given a line and a point not on the line, there

(D, H),

are two lines

we proved that

through the point

that do not intersect the given line.
So we have three dierent, equally valid geometries that share Euclid's
rst four postulates, but each has its own parallel postulate.

Furthermore,

on a small scale, the three geometries all behave similarly. A tiny bug living
on the surface of a sphere might reasonably suspect Euclid's fth postulate
holds, given his limited perspective. A tiny bug in the hyperbolic plane would
reasonably conclude the same. Small triangles have angles adding up nearly

â¦

to 180 , and small circles have areas and circumferences that are accurately
described by the Euclidean formulas

Geometry on Surfaces
(D, H)

In hyperbolic geometry

and elliptic geometry

(P2 , S),

the area of a

triangle is determined by the sum of its angles. This is a signicant dierence
from Euclidean geometry, in which a triangle with three given angles can be
built to have any desired area. Does this mean that if a bug lives in a world
adhering to elliptic geometry, it can never stumble upon a triangle with three
right angles having area

3Ï ?

Yes and no. In the elliptic geometry as dened in

Chapter 6, no such triangle exists because a triangle with 3 right angles must

unit

choice of sphere radius is somewhat arbitrary. What if the radius of the sphere
changes? Imagine a triangle with three right angles having one vertex at the
north pole and two vertices on the equator. If the sphere uniformly expands,
the angles of the triangle will stay the same, but the area of the triangle will
increase. So, if a bug is convinced she lives in a world with elliptic geometry,
but is also convinced she has found a triangle with three right angles and area

3Ï ,

the bug might be drawn to conclude she lives in a world modeled on a

larger sphere than the unit 2-sphere.
The key geometrical property of a space dictating the relationship between
the angles of a triangle and its area is called curvature. Curvature also dictates
the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its radius.

7.1

Curvature

Consider the smooth curve in Figure 7.1.1. The curvature of the curve at a
point is a measure of how drastically the curve bends away from its tangent
line, and this curvature is often studied in a multivariable calculus course.
The radius of curvature at a point corresponds to the radius of the circle that

best approximates the curve at this point. The radius

The curvature of a surface (such as the graph of a function

at

a particular point is a measure of how drastically the surface bends away from

131

Curvature

its tangent plane at the point. There are three fundamental types of curvature.
A surface has positive curvature at a point if the surface lives entirely on one
side of the tangent plane, at least near the point of interest.

The surface

has negative curvature at a point if it is saddle-shaped, in the sense that the
tangent plane cuts through the surface. Between these two cases is the case
of zero curvature. In this case the surface has a line along which the surface
agrees with the tangent plane. For instance, a cylinder has zero curvature, as
suggested in Figure 7.1.2(c).

(a)

Figure 7.1.2:

(b)

(c)

The curvature of a surface at a point can be (a) positive; (b)

negative; or (c) zero.

This informal description of curvature makes use of how the surface is

Theorem
Egregium , states that the curvature of a surface is an intrinsic property of the
embedded in space. One of Gauss' great theorems, one he called his

surface. The curvature doesn't change if the surface is bent without stretching,
and our tireless two-dimensional inhabitant living in the space can determine
the curvature by taking measurements.
A two-dimensional bug living in the hyperbolic plane, the projective plane,
or the Euclidean plane would notice that a small circle's circumference is
related to its radius by the Euclidean formula

c â 2Ïr.

In Euclidean

geometry this formula applies to all circles, but in the non-Euclidean cases,
the observant bug might notice in large circles a signicant dierence between
the actual circumference of a circle and the circumference predicted by

c = 2Ïr.

Large circles about a cup-shaped point with positive curvature will have
circumference less than that predicted by Euclidean geometry.

This fact

explains why a large chunk of orange peel fractures if pressed at onto a table.
Large circles drawn around a saddle-shaped point with negative curvature will
have circumference greater than that predicted by the Euclidean formula.
Calculus may be used to precisely capture this deviation between the
Euclidean-predicted circumference

(Xk , Gk ).

First and foremost, we note that arc-length is an invariant function of

(Xk , Gk ) and that the arc-length ensures that the shortest path from p to q
in (Xk , Gk ) is along the line between them. We have discussed these facts in
the cases k = â1, 0, 1, and the result holds for arbitrary k . So, the arc-length
formula provides a metric on (Xk , Gk ): Given p, q â Xk , we dene dk (p, q) to
be the length of the shortest path from p to q . The circle in (Xk , Gk ) centered
at p through q consists of all points in Xk whose distance from p equals dk (p, q).

Surfaces

Back in Chapter 1 we motivated the study of non-Euclidean geometry with a
question in cosmology: What is the shape of the universe? We discussed the
idea that dierent shapes inherit dierent types of geometry. Indeed, the rules
of geometry are dierent on a sphere than on a at plane. In this section we
take a break from geometry in order to discuss the shapes themselves.
In topology one studies those features of a space that remain unchanged if
the space is stretched or otherwise continuously deformed. Such features of a
space are called topological features.
The features of a space that
geometric features.

do

change under such deformations are

For instance, as a ball is inated its volume, curvature,

and surface area change; these are geometric properties. On the other hand,
no matter how big or lumpy the ball gets, or how it is stretched (unless it
pops!), a loop drawn on the surface of the ball separates the surface into two
disjoint pieces. This is a topological property of the ball. A second topological
property of a space is whether any loop drawn on it can be continuously
contracted (while staying in the space) to a point. The sphere also has this
feature. Nothing about the sphere's shape prevents a loop from shrinking on
the surface to a point.

Figure 7.5.1:

The sphere and torus are topologically distinct.

On the surface of a donut there are loops one can draw that do

not

separate

the surface into disjoint pieces. The loop that goes around the donut like an
armband in Figure 7.5.1 is one such loop. Furthermore, this loop cannot be
continuously contracted to a point while staying on the surface. This suggests
the surface of a ball and the surface of a donut are topologically dierent
shapes.
The sphere is an example of a

simply connected space because any loop

drawn on the surface can be contracted to a point. The torus is an example of
a

multiconnected space

because there exist loops in the torus that cannot

be contracted to a point.

Roughly speaking, two spaces are topologically equivalent, or homeomorphic , if one can be continuously deformed to look like the other. For instance,
a circle is topologically equivalent to a square. One can be mapped onto the
other via a

homeomorphism : a continuous bijection between the objects that

has a continuous inverse. One homeomorphism is suggested in the following
example.

We are quickly heading into the realm of topology, and must resist the
temptation to dive headlong and formally into this rich subject. In this text
we restrict our focus to a whirlwind tour of topological tools that are used
to investigate possible shapes for two- and three-dimensional universes.

We

encourage the reader interested in a more formal approach to the subject to
consult any number of good texts, including [9].
Our candidate universes are examples of manifolds.

A topological

n-

manifold is a space with the feature that each point in the space has a
neighborhood that looks like a patch of

Rn .

In cosmology, the spatial section of

space-time is assumed to be a 3-manifold, and when we ask about the shape of
the universe, we are asking about the shape of this 3-manifold. In this section
we focus on 2-manifolds.

If a point

is not on an edge, as in Figure 7.5.5, then by choosing

a radius small enough, there is an open 2-ball about the point that
misses the edges.
If a point

q

is on an edge but not at a corner, then by choosing a

radius small enough, there is an open 2-ball about the point that misses
the corners. This open 2-ball consists of parts of two open 2-balls from

R2 .

Because of the edge identication, these open 2-ball halves come

together to form a perfect open 2-ball about the point.
If a point

u

is at a corner of the rectangle, there is an open 2-ball

about the point that consists of parts of four dierent open 2-balls from

R2 .

Because of the edge identication, these four quarter balls come

together to form a single open 2-ball of points around the corner point.

call it a surface. We note that another topological term, compactness, is often
used when discussing surfaces.

A space living in

if and only

if it is closed and bounded. Thus, for us, a surface is a compact, connected
2-manifold.
Rather than concern ourselves with a formal development of these topological concepts, we take with us this informal introduction to help us to pursue
the construction of surfaces. It turns out that all surfaces can be built from
the three venerable surfaces in Figure 7.5.7 by a process called the connected
sum.

is obtained as follows:

2. Connect the boundaries of these open 2-ball with a cylinder.
Note that since

Xi

is a surface, each point in each space has a neighborhood

homeomorphic to an open 2-ball, so we may always achieve the connected sum
of two surfaces. The result is a new surface: it is still closed, bounded, and

152

open 2-ball.

is called the two-holed torus, and it is topologically

equivalent to the surface labeled

in Figure 7.5.10. One can shrink

the length dimension of the connecting cylinder to make the one look
like the other. The surface

S2 #T2

is homeomorphic to the torus

T2 .

To see this, observe that if one removes an open-2 ball from a sphere
and attaches one end of a cylinder to the sphere along the boundary
of the removed disk, the result is homeomorphic to a closed disk, as
suggested in the following diagram. So, if one removes an open 2-ball

7. Geometry on Surfaces

Polygonal Surfaces
C2

Our representation of

is an example of a

polygonal surface .

To build

a polygonal surface, start with a nite number of polygons having an even
number of edges and then identify edges in pairs.
If the surface is built from a single polygon, the edge identications of
the polygon can be encoded in a

boundary label .

Each edge of the polygon

gets assigned a letter and an orientation. Edges that are identied have the
same letter, and we obtain a boundary label by traversing the boundary of our
polygon in the counter-clockwise direction (by convention) and recording the
letters we encounter, with an exponent of +1 if our walk is in the direction
of the oriented edge, and an exponent of -1 if our walk is in the opposite
direction of the oriented edge. For instance, a boundary label for the surface

C2

found in Figure 7.5.11 is

a1 a1 a2 a2 .

Furthermore, we may inductively show

that by repeating the connected sum operation of Figure 7.5.11 to

The remarkable theorem here is that the handlebody surfaces and the crosscap surfaces account for all possible surfaces, without redundancy.

Theorem 7.5.12. Any surface is homeomorphic to the sphere

S2 , a handlebody surface Hg with g â¥ 1, or a crosscap surface Cg with g â¥ 1. Moreover,

no two surfaces in this list are homeomoprhic to each other.

Two proofs of this theorem are oating around the literature now.

The

classic proof, which makes use of cell divisions, can be found, for instance,
in [9]. The new proof, due to John Conway, bypasses the articial constructs
in the classic proof, and can be found in [12].
To summarize, we have two ways to think about surfaces.

Characterizing a surface
If somebody throws a surface at us, how do we know which one we're catching?
One way to characterize a surface is to determine two particular topological
invariants: its orientability status and its Euler characteristic.

Let's discuss

what these features of a surface are.

Orientability status
The

MÃ¶bius strip

is obtained from a rectangle by identifying the left and

right edges with a twist:

Figure 7.5.14:

A MÃ¶bius strip.

Notice that a MÃ¶bius strip has an orientation-reversing path.

A clock

rotating clockwise, if it heads along the MÃ¶bius strip, will eventually return to
its starting place to nd that it is now rotating counterclockwise.

If a

The MÃ¶bius

strip itself is not a surface as we've dened it because it has an edge. Points
on this edge don't have any neighborhoods that look like open 2-balls (they

156

7. Geometry on Surfaces

look more like half balls). But the Klein bottle in the following example is a
non-orientable surface.

Example 7.5.15: The Klein bottle.
The Klein bottle looks a lot like the torus, but there's a twist.

The

top and bottom edges are identied as they were for the torus, but the
left and right edges are oriented oppositely.

More formally, it is the

polygonal surface obtained from a square with boundary label
and the Klein bottle is denoted by

abaâ1 b,

K2 .

Why is the Klein bottle non-orientable? A bug leaving the screen
on the right near the top would reappear on the left near the bottom.
But take a closer look, the bug has become mirror-reversed.

a

b

b

a

This orientation-reversing path exists because of a MÃ¶bius strip
lurking in the Klein bottle. (Conisder, for instance, the thin horizontal
strip formed by the dashed segments in the gure.)
The same bug living in the torus would never nd itself mirror
reversed as a result of traveling in its surface. The torus is orientable.

A surface's orientability status is a topological invariant. This means that if

S

and

T

are homeomorphic surfaces then they must have the same orientability

status. Notice that there exists a MÃ¶bius strip in each
from the middle of one

a1

Cg

(take a thin strip

edge to the middle of the other), so that all cross-cap

surfaces are non-orientable. On the other hand, all the handlebody surfaces

Hg (g â¥ 0)

are orientable.

Euler Characteristic
In addition to an orientability status, each surface has attached to it an
integer called the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic is a topological
invariant, and it can be calculated from a cell division of a surface, which is a
kind of tiling of the surface by planar faces. Let's make this more precise.
An

n-dimensional

cell , or n-cell , is a subset of a space whose interior is

homeomorphic to an open

n-ball

in

Rn .

For instance, a 1-cell, also called an

edge , is a set whose interior is homeomorphic to an open interval; a 2-cell, or
face , is a set whose interior is homeomorphic to an open 2-ball in the plane. We
call points in a space 0-cells. A 0-cell is also called a vertex (plural vertices ).

Denition 7.5.16.

1. The interiors of any two cells in the complex are disjoint

At each end of an edge is a vertex (possibly the same vertex

at each end), and no two edges intersect in their interiors.

The left

side of the following diagram shows a 1-complex with seven 0-cells and
ve 1-cells. To the right is a 2-complex with one 0-cell and one 2-cell.
The entire boundary of the 2-cell is attached to the single 0-cell, thus
creating a well-known surface, the 2-sphere.

Example 7.5.18: The Platonic solids..
The ve Platonic solids can be viewed as 2-complexes if we ignore the
space bounded by their faces. We've pictured all ve, and given vertex,
edge, and face counts for each one.
Of course, the region bounded by the faces of each Platonic solid
is homeomorphic to an open 3-ball, so the Platonic solids can also be
viewed as 3-complexes; each solid having exactly one 3-cell.

A dodecahedron and sphere are homeomorphic.

Example 7.5.21: Attempted cell divisions of H1 .
Three cell divisions of the torus are pictured below, along with one
failed cell division.

In each valid cell division, we count the number

of faces, edges, and vertices of the cell division. To make an accurate
count, one must take the edge identication into account.

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Cell division (a) has two vertices, six edges, and four faces.

One

vertex is in the center of the rectangle, and the other vertex is in the
corner (remember, all four corners get identied to a single point).
As for the edges, four emanate from the center vertex, and we have
two others: the horizontal edge along the boundary of the rectangle
(appearing twice), and the vertical edge along the boundary (also
appearing twice).

Thus, the edges of the rectangle are also edges of

the cell division, so the faces in this cell division are triangles, and
there are four of them.
Cell division (b) has six vertices, eight edges, and two faces. There
are four vertices in the interior of the rectangle, one vertex on the
horizontal boundary of the rectangle, and one vertex on the vertical
boundary. Notice that the corner point of the rectangle is not a vertex
of the cell division. To count the edges, observe that four edges form
the inner diamond, and one edge leaves each vertex of the diamond,
for a total of eight edges. The boundary edges of the rectangle do
form edges in this cell division.

Counting faces, we have one inside

the diamond and one outside the diamond. Convince yourself that the
region outside the diamond makes just one face.
You can check that cell division (c) has one vertex in the center of
the rectangle, two edges (one is horizontal, the other is vertical), and
one face.
The attempt (d) fails to be a cell division of the torus. Why is this?
At rst glance, we have four vertices, four edges, and two faces. The
trouble here is the face outside the inner square. It is not a 2-cell that is, its interior is not homeomorphic to an open 2-ball. To see this,
note that this region contains a loop that does not separate the face
into two pieces. Can you nd such a loop? Since no open 2-ball has
this feature, the region in question is not homeomorphic to an open
2-ball.

Denition 7.5.22.

The

Euler characteristic of a surface S , denoted Ï(S),

is

Ï(S) = v â e + f
where

v , e,

and

f

denote the number of 0-cells (vertices), 1-cells (edges), and

2-cells (faces), respectively, of a cell division of the surface.
The Euler characteristic is well-dened.

This means that dierent cell

divisions of the same surface will determine the same value of

Ï.

Furthermore,

this simple number is a powerful topological invariant: If two surfaces have
dierent Euler characteristics then they are not homeomorphic. However, the
Euler characteristic alone doesn't completely characterize a surface:

if two

surfaces have the same Euler characteristic, they need not be homeomorphic.
The Euler characteristic of the sphere is 2.
Example 7.5.18 is a cell division of

Ï(S2 ) = 2.

Each valid cell division in

v â e + f = 0.

Each polygonal surface induces a cell division of the surface.

This cell

division has a single face, and after identifying the edges in pairs, the corners
and edges of the underlying polygon correspond to vertices and edges in
the cell division of the surface.

To determine the Euler characteristic of a

polygonal surface, be careful to make edge and vertex counts

Keep circling the corner (according to the sequence indicated) until you return to the starting point. Notice that all eight corners are traversed before

division has 2g edges, and there is one face, the interior of the polygon. Thus,

Geometry of Surfaces

If you've got a surface in your hand, you can nd a homeomorphic version
of the surface on which to construct hyperbolic geometry, elliptic geometry,
or Euclidean geometry.

And the choice of geometry is unique:

No surface

admits more than one of these geometries. As we shall see, of the innitely
many surfaces, all but four admit hyperbolic geometry (two admit Euclidean
geometry and two admit elliptic geometry). Thus, if you randomly generate a
constant curvature surface for a two-dimensional bug named Bormit, Bormit
will no doubt live in a world with hyperbolic geometry.
Chances are, too, that a constant curvature surface cannot be embedded in
three-dimensional space. Only the sphere has this nice feature. In fact, if
is any surface that lives in

R3 ,

then it must have at least one point with positive curvature.
The surface in

R3

X

like the handlebody surfaces in Figure 7.5.10,
Why is this?

is bounded, so there must be some sphere in

R3

centered

at the origin that contains the entire surface. Shrink this sphere until it just
bumps into the surface at some point.

The curvature of the surface at this

point matches the curvature of the sphere, which is positive.
We have seen that any surface is homeomorphic to a polygonal surface
representing

Hg

or

Cg , for some g , and we now show that each of these may be

given a homogeneous, isotropic and metric geometry (so that it has constant
curvature). A polygonal surface can only run into trouble homogeneity-wise
where the corners come together. Any point in the interior of the polygon has
a nice 360

â¦

patch of space about it, as does any point in the interior of an

7.6.

Geometry of Surfaces

163

edge. However, if the angles of the corners that come together at a point do

â¦

not add up to 360 , then the surface has either a cone point or a saddle-point,

â¦

depending on whether the angle sum is less than or more than 360 . As we
saw in Chapter 1 (Exercises 1.3.5 and Checkpoint 1.3.7), in either case, we
will not have a homogeneous geometry; a two-dimensional bug would be able
to distinguish (with triangles or circles) a cone point from a at point from a
saddle point.
To smooth out such cone points or saddle points we change the angles at
the corners so that the angles

do

â¦

add up to 360 . We now have the means for

doing this. If we need to shrink the corner angles, we can put the polygon in
the hyperbolic plane. If we need to expand the angles, we can put the polygon
in the projective plane.

Example 7.6.1:

C3

C3 = P2 #P2 #P2 ,

The standard polygonal representation of

a1 a1 a2 a2 a3 a3 ,

is a

as in Figure 7.6.2. All

six corners of the hexagon come together at a single point.

In the

â¦

Euclidean plane, a regular hexagon has corner angles equal to 120 . To
avoid a saddle point when joining the six corners together, shrink the

â¦

corner angles to 60 . A tiny copy of a regular hexagon in the hyperbolic

â¦

plane will have corner angles just under 120 . If the hexagon grows so
that its vertices approach ideal points, its corner angles will approach

â¦

0 . At some point, then, the interior angles will be 60

â¦

on the nose.

(We may construct this precise hexagon as well. See Exercise 7.6.4.) If

C3

is built from this hexagon living in the hyperbolic plane, the surface

covers the entire projective plane. In fact, the surface of Example 1.3.9

is

the projective plane, and it admits elliptic geometry.

Theorem 7.6.4. Each surface admits one homogeneous, isotropic, and metric
geometry. In particular, the sphere (H0 ) and projective plane (C1 ) admit
elliptic geometry. The torus (H1 ) and Klein bottle (C2 ) admit Euclidean
geometry. All handlebody surfaces Hg with g â¥ 2 and all cross-cap surfaces Cg
with g â¥ 3 admit hyperbolic geometry.
The following section oers a more formal discussion of how any surface
admits one of our three geometries but we present an intuitive argument here.
The sphere and projective plane admit elliptic geometry by construction:
The space in elliptic geometry

is

the projective plane, and via stereographic

projection, this is the geometry on

S2 .

The torus and Klein bottle are built from regular 4-gons (squares) whose
edges are identied in such a way that all 4 corners come together at a point.
In each case, if we place the square in the Euclidean plane all corner angles are

Ï/2, so the sum of the angles is 2Ï , and our surfaces admit Euclidean geometry.
Each handlebody surfaces Hg for g â¥ 2 and each cross-cap surfaces Cg for
g â¥ 3 can be built from a regular n-gon where n â¥ 6. Again, all n corners
come together at a single point. A regular n-gon in the Euclidean plane has
interior angle (n â 2)Ï/n radians, so the corner angles sum to (n â 2)Ï radians.
This angle sum exceeds 2Ï radians since n â¥ 6. Placing a small version of this
n-gon in the hyperbolic plane, the corner angle sum will be very nearly equal
to (n â 2)Ï radians and will exceed 2Ï radians, but as we expand the n-gon
the corners approach ideal points and the corner angles sum will approach
0 radians.

Thus, at some point the angle sum will equal 2Ï radians on the

nose, and the polygonal surface built from this precise

n-gon admits hyperbolic
n-gon.

geometry. Exercise 7.6.4 works through how to construct this precise

Of course, one need not build a surface from a regular polygon. For instance,
the torus can be built from any rectangle in the Euclidean plane and it will
inherit Euclidean geometry. So while the type of geometry our surface admits

is

determined, we have some exibility where certain geometric measurements

are concerned.

For instance, there is no restriction on the total area of the

torus, and the rectangle on which it is formed can have arbitrary length and
width dimensions. These dimensions would have a simple, tangible meaning
to a two-dimensional bug living in the surface (and might be experimentally
determined).

Each dimension corresponds to the length of a geodesic path

that would return the bug to its starting point. A

closed geodesic path in a

surface is a path that follows along a straight line (in the underlying geometry)
that starts and ends at the same point. Figure 7.6.5 shows three closed geodesic
paths, all starting and ending at a point near a bug's house. The length of one
path equals the width of the rectangle, the length of another equals the length
of the rectangle, and the third follows a path that is longer than the rst two.

7.6.

Figure 7.6.5:

Geometry of Surfaces

165

A at torus has many closed geodesic paths. The length of the

shortest closed geodesic path equals the length of the short side of the rectangle
on which the torus is modeled.

Even in hyperbolic surfaces, where the area of the surface is xed (for a
given curvature) by the Gauss-Bonnet formula, which we prove shortly, there is
freedom in determining the length of closed geodesic paths.

Example 7.6.6: Building hyperbolic surfaces from pants.
If we make three slices in the two-holed torus we obtain two pairs of
pants, as indicated in the following gure.

can be cut into two hexagons by cutting along the three vertical seams
in the pants.

It follows that the two-holed torus can be constructed

from four hexagons, with edges identied in pairs as indicated below.

The four hexagons represent a cell division of

endow it with a homogeneous geometry. We know we can do this in
the hyperbolic plane. Moreover, according to Theorem 5.4.19, there is
freedom in choosing the dimensions of the hexagons. That is, for each

Proof.

so in this case the Gauss-Bonnet formula reduces to the true statement that

This completes the proof.
Suppose a two-dimensional cosmologist believes she lives in a surface of
constant curvature (because her universe looks homogeneous and isotropic). If
she can deduce the curvature of the universe and its total area, she will know its
Euler characteristic. That is, by measuring these geometric properties she can
deduce the shape of her universe, or, at worst, narrow down the possibilities
to two. If

Ï

is 2 or an odd integer then the cosmologist will know the shape

of the universe. If

Ï<2

is even, her universe will have one of two possible

shapes - one shape orientable, the other non-orientable.

Thus y â¼G x, and so â¼G is symmetric. Third, transitivity of the relation
follows from the fact that the composition of two maps in G is again in G.
Given geometry (X, G) we let X/G denote the quotient set determined by
the equivalence relation â¼G . In this setting we call the equivalence class of a
point x in X , the orbit of x. So, the orbit of x consists of all points in the
space X to which x can be mapped under transformations of the group G:

Consider the quotient space in Example 7.7.7. The group here is a group of
isometries, since rotations preserve Euclidean distance, but it is not xed-point
free. All maps in

have xed points (rotation about the origin xes 0). This

prevents the quotient space from inheriting the geometry of its mother space.

Start with a perfectly sized polygon in

D. The polygon must have corner
2Ï radians, and the edges that get identied must have equal

length so that an isometry can take one to the other.

(In every example so

far, we have used regular polygons in which all sides have the same length, but
asymmetric polygons will also work.) Next, for each pair of oriented edges to be
identied, nd a hyperbolic isometry that maps one onto the other (respecting
the orientation of the edges). The group generated by these isometries creates
a quotient space homeomorphic to the space represented by the polygon, and it
inherits hyperbolic geometry. Note also that the initial polygon can be moved
by the isometries in the group to tile all of

without gaps or overlaps.

Then, begin inating the circle (and all of its images).

Eventually the circles will touch one another, and as the circles continue to
expand let them press into each other so that they form a geodesic boundary
edge. When the circle has lled the entire surface, it will have formed a polygon
with edges identied in pairs. This polygon is the Dirichlet domain.
At any basepoint in the torus of Example 7.7.8 the Dirichlet domain will
be a rectangle identical in proportions to the fundamental domain. In general,
however, the shape of a Dirichlet domain may be dierent than the polygon on
which the surface was built, and the shape of the Dirichlet domain may vary
from point to point, which is rather cool.

Cosmic Topology
Cosmic topology can be described as the eort to determine the shape of
our universe through observational techniques. In this chapter we discuss two
programs of research in cosmic topology: the cosmic crystallography method
and the circles-in-the-sky method.

Both programs search for topology by

assuming the universe is nite in volume without boundary.

The chapter

begins with a discussion of three-dimensional geometry and some 3-manifolds
that have been given consideration as models for the shape of our universe.

8.1

Three-Dimensional Geometry and 3-Manifolds

Recall that

R3

is the set of ordered triples of real numbers

(x, y, z),

and a

3-manifold is a space with the feature that every point has a neighborhood
that is homeomorphic to an open 3-ball.

We assume that the shape of the

universe at any xed time is a 3-manifold. Evidence points to a universe that
is isotropic and homogeneous on the largest scales. If this is the case, then just
as in the two-dimensional case, the universe admits one of three geometries:
hyperbolic, elliptic, or Euclidean. This section oers a brief introduction to the
three-dimensional versions of these geometries before turning to 3-manifolds.
The reader is encouraged to see [12] for a broader intuitive discussion of these
ideas, or [11] for a more rigorous approach.

Euclidean Geometry in Three Dimensions

Euclidean geometry is the

geometry of our experience in three dimensions.

Planes look like innite

tabletops, lines in space are Euclidean straight lines.

Any planar slice of 3-

space inherits two-dimensional Euclidean geometry.
The space for three-dimensional Euclidean geometry is

is given by the Euclidean distance formula

|v â w| =

p
(x1 â x2 )2 + (y1 â y2 )2 + (z1 â z2 )2 .

Any transformation in the group can be expressed as a screw motion. A

screw motion

is a transformation of

R3

consisting of a translation in the

direction of a line followed by a rotation about that same line.

Of course,

rotations about lines and translations are special cases of this more general
map.

Great circles in

Great circles correspond to geodesics in the space. Similarly, a great 2-sphere

is a 2-sphere of maximum diameter drawn in the space. As a subspace of

8. Cosmic Topology

a great 2-sphere inherits the elliptic geometry of Chapter 6. The 3-sphere

is discussed in more detail in Example 8.1.3.
The transformation group for elliptic geometry in three dimensions is
conveniently described by viewing

as the set of quaternions. A

quaternion

i, j, and k
= â1 and the
additional property that the product ijk = â1. The constant a is called the

(so that the faces are portions of planes

), the angles at which the corners come together are smaller than the

corner angles of the Euclidean dodecahedron. These angles shrink further as
the corner points of the solid approach ideal points on the sphere at innity.
On the other hand, placing the dodecahedron in

S3

will increase the angles at

the corners.
This exibility is very useful.

Whereas surfaces can be constructed

from polygons by identifying their edges in pairs, many 3-manifolds can be
constructed from a 3-complex (such as the Platonic solids) by identifying its
faces in pairs.

A 3-manifold built in this way will admit either Euclidean

geometry, hyperbolic geometry, or elliptic geometry depending on how, if at
all, the corner angles need to change so that the corners come together to
form a perfect patch of three-dimensional space.

Now we investigate a few

3-manifolds and the geometry they admit.

Example 8.1.2: The 3-torus.
We may think of the 3-torus

T3

as a cubical room with the following

face (or wall) identications: if we propel ourselves (with a jet pack)
up through the ceiling, we reappear through the oor directly below
where we had been. For instance, the elliptical points in the following

Three-Dimensional Geometry and 3-Manifolds

The 3-torus is the three-dimensional analogue of the torus video
screen we saw on the rst pages of this text.

In fact, a slice of the

is

a torus. One checks

that under the face identication, all eight corners come together in
a single point. The angles at these corners are such that they form a
perfect patch of three-dimensional space.

We do not need to inate

the corner angles (in elliptic space) or shrink the angles (in hyperbolic
space) in order for the corners to come together perfectly.
We can also view the 3-torus as an orbit space as discussed in

Tx , Ty , Tz represent translations of R3 by
one unit in the x-direction, y -direction, and z -direction, respectively.
That is, Tx (x, y, z) = (x + 1, y, z), Ty (x, y, z) = (x, y + 1, z) and
Tz (x, y, z) = (x, y, z +1). These three transformations generate a group
3
of transformations Î of R , and any transformation in the group has
the form T (x, y, z) = (x + a, y + b, z + c) where a, b, c are integers. A

fundamental domain of the quotient space R /Î is the unit cube

generated by Euclidean isometries, and

it inherits Euclidean geometry.
The 3-torus is one of just ten compact and connected 3-manifolds admiting
Euclidean geometry.

Of these ten, six are orientable, and four are non-

orientable. The 3-torus is orientable, and the other ve orientable Euclidean
manifolds are presented below in Example 8.1.7 and Example 8.1.9.
The elliptic 3-manifolds have also been classied. There are innitely many
dierent types, and it turns out they are all orientable. The 3-sphere is the
simplest elliptic 3-manifold, and Albert Einstein assumed the universe had this
shape when he rst solved his equations for general relativity. He found a static,
nite, simply connected universe without boundary appealing for aesthetic
reasons, and it cleared up some paradoxes in physics that arise in an innite
universe. However, the equations of general relativity only tell us about the
local nature of space, and do not x the global shape of the universe. In 1917,
the Dutch astronomer Willem De Sitter (1872-1934) noticed that Einstein's
solutions admitted a another, dierent global shape: namely three-dimensional
elliptic space obtained from the 3-sphere by identifying antipodal points, just
as we did in Chapter 6 in the two-dimensional case.

Example 8.1.3: The 3-sphere.
Recall, the 3-sphere consists of all points in 4-dimensional space 1 unit
from the origin:

S3 = {(x, y, z, w) | x2 + y 2 + z 2 + w2 = 1}.
One model of

S3

consists of two solid balls in

R3

whose boundary

2-spheres are identied point for point, as in the following gure. The

The 3-sphere has interesting features, often accessible by analogy
with the 2-sphere.

If you slice the 2-sphere with a plane in

R3 ,

the

intersection is a circle (or a single point if the plane is tangent to the
2-sphere). Moreover, the circle of intersection is a geodesic on the 2sphere if it is a great circle: a circle of maximum radius drawn on the

2-sphere. Bumped up a dimension, if you slice the 3-sphere with

In this way, we can transfer the geometry of the 3-sphere into
real 3-space with a point at innity attached to it.

For instance,

P = (a, b, c, d) is on the 3-sphere, its antipodal point is âP =

It is cumbersome to indicate all face

identications, so the gure below shows the identication of the front
face with the back face. For instance, the two corners labeled with a 1
get matched.Notice: no points in the interior of the dodecahedron get
identied.
With this face identication the twenty corners of the dodecahedron
come together in ve groups of four (one group of 4 is marked with
vertices in the gure), and the angles are too small for the corners
to create a full open ball of three-dimensional space when they come
together. Placing the dodecahedron in elliptic space inates the corner
angles, and we may make these angles fat enough to determine a perfect
three-dimensional patch of space.

Extending the ideas of Section 7.7 to this case, one can show that the

group of isometries. The dodecahedron pictured here is a fundamental
domain of the space. Just as the polygons in Section 7.7 tiled the space

Hyperbolic 3-manifolds have not been completely classied, but a remarkable relationship exists between geometry and shape in this case: a connected
orientable 3-manifold supports at most one hyperbolic structure. This marks
an important dierence from the two-dimensional case. If a two-dimensional
being knows that she lives in a two-holed torus, say, then the area of her
universe is determined by its curvature, thanks to the Gauss-Bonnet formula,
but other geometric properties may vary, such as the length of minimal-length

Here is one hyperbolic 3-manifold, also built as a quotient of the dodecahedron.

is found by reecting u across the xy -plane, then rotating around the
z -axis by 2Ïq/p radians. Each point on the equator is identied with
p â 1 other points.
The lens space L(p, q) can be obtained from a cell division of the
unit solid ball. The cell division has p + 2 vertices: the north pole n,
the south pole s, and p equally spaced vertices along the equator, label
them v0 , v1 , Â· Â· Â· , vpâ1 . The following gure depicts this scene for p = 5.
There is an edge connecting vi to each of its neighbors on the equator,
creating p edges around the equator. There is an edge connecting each
vi with n and an edge connecting each vi with s, as pictured, for a
total of 3p edges. The vertices and edges create 2p triangular faces on
the boundary sphere, half of them in the northern hemisphere.

Let Ni denote the face in the northern hemisphere whose vertices are

are vi , vi+1 , and s. The lens space L(p, q) is created by identifying face
Ni with face Si+q where the sum i + q is taken modulo p. For instance,
in L(5, 2), the shaded face N0 in the gure is identied with the shaded
face S2 (and the circle of points pictured in N0 gets sent to the circle
of points in S2 ). The faces N1 and S3 are identied, as are N2 with S4 ,
N3 with S0 and N4 with S1 .

Example 8.1.7: The Hantschze-Wendt manifold.
This interesting manifold can be constructed from two identically sized
cubes that share a face, as in the following gure. The resulting box
has 10 faces to be identied in pairs.

A three-dimensional bug with

a jet pack living in the manifold would experience the following face
identications.

The top and bottom faces are identied just as they

were in the 3-torus.

Each point on the top back face (see the circle

in the gure) is identied with a single point on the bottom back
face. This point is the reection of the given point across the vertical
segment bisecting the face. The top front face and the bottom front
face are identied the same way. The gure shows two square points
on these faces that are identied. The top left face and bottom right

face are identied with a 180

rotation (see the elliptical point and

its image point), as are the bottom left face and the top right face
(the two triangular points are identied). This 3-manifold also inherits
Euclidean geometry.

A more elegant description of this manifold makes use of the orbit space
construction of Section 7.7.

each screw motion consists of rotation by 180

and translation by unit length.

The Hantzsche-Wendt manifold is then the quotient of

by the group of

Euclidean isometries generated by the three screw motions, and it inherits
Euclidean geometry.

Figure 8.2.2:

Detecting multiple images with a tiling of the universal

Practically speaking, detecting multiple images of the same object is
complicated by the nite speed of light. Since the lines of sight in Figure 8.2.2
have dierent lengths, we see the object

G

at dierent times in its evolution.

In reality, galaxies evolve dramatically over time. So even if we found an image
of

G

looking in some longer direction, it might look so dierent we wouldn't

recognize it.
Still, humanity has pondered the tantalizing possibility that one of the
many distant galaxies we've detected with our telescopes is actually the Milky
Way galaxy. Based on recent lower-bound estimates of the size of our universe,
however, it is now clear that we will not be treated to such a sight.
Rather than spotting dierent images of a particular object, perhaps we
can detect multiple images of the same object indirectly. Consider a catalog
of similar objects that don't evolve too rapidly (such as galaxy superclusters).
Assume we have observed

N

such objects and they appear to be sprinkled

randomly about the universe (the universe is homogeneous and isotropic after
all). In Figure 8.2.3 we have generated a two-dimensional random distribution
of point sources.

We've

There is a copy

of this object just below the bottom edge of the fundamental domain.

The

distance between a point in this sled and its image below equals the length of
the width dimension of our torus, which is 14 in this simulation. Indeed, there
are lots of points for which we see an image displaced vertically in this manner,
so this distance will occur lots of time in the pair separation histogram.
Another copy of our big sled appears just to the right of the right edge of
the fundamental domain. So, the distance between a point and its horizontally
displaced image will be equal to the length dimension of the torus, which is
10 in this simulation. There are also lots of these pairs in the catalog - in fact
more than before since this dimension of the fundamental rectangle is smaller.
This accounts for the larger spike in the histogram above the distance 10.

from the origin, the further it moves. In the exercises you prove that non-trivial
isometries in the hyperbolic plane are not Cliord translations.
Recall that to create the PSH of a catalog in the cosmic crystallography
method we must rst make an assumption about the geometry of the universe.
The PSH in Figure 8.2.6 was generated by computing the

Euclidean

distances

between points in the catalog. If we assumed a hyperbolic universe and used
the hyperbolic metric to produce the PSH, the spikes would vanish.
In essence, the method of cosmic crystallography pours over catalogs of
astronomical objects, computing distances between all pairs of objects in the
catalog, and then looking for spikes in the pair separation histogram.

The

192

8. Cosmic Topology

detection of a spike in the histogram that cannot be reasonably explained by
chance in the distribution of objects indicates a nite universe.
The method of cosmic crystallography has limitations beyond the obvious
challenge of accurately measuring astronomical distances. As you will see in
the exercises, dierent shapes might produce identical spikes, so nding a spike
in a PSH doesn't precisely determine the shape of our universe (though it would
certainly narrow down the list of candidates). All ten Euclidean 3-manifolds
will reveal a spike (or spikes) in the PSH if we can see far enough to detect the
nite dimensions. Some of the elliptic 3-manifolds will produce spikes in the
PSH, but no hyperbolic 3-manifold would reveal itself by this method, since
hyperbolic isometries are not Cliord translations.
To date, no statistically signicant spikes have been found in the pair
separation histograms computed from real catalogs. Two good surveys of this
method, including information about generating simulated catalogs, can be
found in [26] and [24].
More sensitive methods have been proposed that might detect any 3-manifold,
regardless of geometry, and we look at one such method below.

Example 8.2.7: Collecting correlated pairs.
In a catalog of images, there are two types of pairs that might generate
recurring distances.

The cosmic crystallography method outlined

previously detects what have been called Type II pairs in the literature:
A Type II pair is a pair of points of the form

{p, T (p)},

where

T

is

a transformation from the group of isometries used to generate the
manifold.

If

T

transforms each point the same distance (i.e., if

T

is

a Cliord translation), then this common distance will appear in the
PSH as a spike.
The other type of recurring distance can arise from what's been
called a Type I pair of points in the catalog. A Type I pair consists of
any pair

{p, q} of

points. If we can see images of these points in a copy

T (p), T (q), then since transformations
d(p, q) = d(T (p), T (q)), and this common distance

of the fundamental domain, say
preserve distance,

will have occurred at least twice in the PSH. The gure below shows
a portion of the torus tiling of the plane depicted in Figure 8.2.2. The
two types of pairs of points are visible:

Type I pairs are joined by

dashed segments, and Type II pairs are joined by solid segments.

the spike generated by this set of pairs having the same distance is not

Circles in the Sky

Immediately after the big bang, the universe was so hot that the usual
constituents of matter could not form.

Photons could not move freely in

space, as they were constantly bumping into free electrons. Eventually, about
350,000 years after the big bang, the universe had expanded and cooled to
the point that light could travel unimpeded.

This free radiation is called

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and much of it is still
travelling today. The universe has cooled and expanded to the point that this
radiation has stretched to the microwave end of the electromagnetic spectrum,
having a wavelength of about 1 or 2 millimeters.
The CMB radiation is coming to us from every direction, and it has all
been travelling for the same amount of time - and at the same speed.

This

means that it has all traveled the same distance to reach us at this moment.
Thus, we may think of the CMB radiation that we can detect at this instant
as having come from the surface of a giant 2-sphere with us at the sphere's
center. This giant 2-sphere is called the

last scattering surface (LSS).

It is perhaps comforting to think that everyone in the universe has their
own last scattering surface, that everyone's LSS has the same radius, and that
this radius is growing in time.
The CMB radiation coming to us has a temperature that is remarkably
uniform: it is constant to a few parts in 100,000, which makes the temperature
of the radiation in the LSS very nearly perfectly uniform.

As Craig Hogan

points out in [14], this is much smoother than a billiard ball.

Nonetheless,

there are slight variations in the temperature. These variations, due to slight
imbalances in the distribution of matter in the early universe, were predicted
well before they were nally found (when our instruments became sensitive

196

8. Cosmic Topology

enough to detect them). These very slight temperature dierences might reveal
the shape of the universe.
Imagine our universe is a giant 3-torus. Assume a fundamental domain for
the universe is a rectangular box as shown in Example 8.1.2, and that this box
is our Dirichlet domain (we're at the center of this box). We may tile

R3

with

copies of this fundamental domain, placing ourselves in the same position of
each copy of the fundamental domain. Now, imagine our last scattering surface
in the fundamental domain. In fact, there will be a copy of our last scattering
surface surrounding each copy of us in each copy of the fundamental domain.
If our last scattering surface is small relative to the size of the fundamental
domain, as in Figure 8.3.1(a), then it will not intersect any of its copies.
However, if the last scattering surface is large relative to the size of the
fundamental domain, as in Figure 8.3.1(b), then it will intersect one or more
of its copies. Moreover, adjacent copies of the LSS will intersect in a circle. In
this happy case, our last scattering surface will contain circles with matching
temperature distributions. Look again at Figure 8.3.1(b). We have three copies
of our fundamental domain pictured as well as three copies of the LSS (only one
of which is shaded to make the situation less cluttered). Two vertical circles
of intersection appear in the gure. From our point of view at the center of
the LSS, the two images of the circle will be directly opposite one another in
the sky. Since these circles are one and the same, the temperature distribution
around the two circles will agree. Therein lies the hope. Scan the temperature
distribution in the last scattering surface for matching circles.

(a)

Figure 8.3.1:

(b)

The LSS compared to the size of a 3-torus universe.

In (a)

the LSS is small, so it won't reveal the shape of the universe; in (b) the LSS
intersects itself and will have circles of matching temperature distributions.

This strategy for detecting a nite universe is called the

sky

circles-in-the-

method, which, in cosmic topology, has advantages over the cosmic

crystallography method. In theory, the circles-in-the-sky method can be used
to detect any compact manifold, regardless of the geometry it admits. Also,
the search for matching circles is independent of a metric. One doesn't need
to make a claim about the geometry of the universe to detect a nite universe.
This method is computationally very intensive. The search for matching
circles on this giant 2-sphere involves the analysis of a six parameter space: the
center

(Î¸1 , Ï1 )

of one circle on the LSS, the center of the second circle

the common angular radius

Î±

(Î¸2 , Ï2 ),

of the two circles (since these circles are copies

of the same circle they will have the same radius), and the relative phase of the
two circles, say

Î².

(See the diagram that follows.) In general,

Î² 6= 0

if the face

identications in the 3-manifold involve rotations. It remains for us to analyze
whether a statistically signicant correlation exists between the temperatures
as we proceed around the circles.

When comparing the size of the LSS relative to the size of space, it is
convenient to dene the following length dimension. The

injectivity radius

rinj , is half the distance of the shortest closed

at a point in a manifold, denoted

geodesic path that starts and ends at that point. A necessary condition, then,
for detecting matching circles in the LSS at our location is that our observable
radius

robs

exceeds our injectivity radius

rinj .

Example 8.3.2: Detecting the 3-torus from the LSS.
If the universe is a 3-torus, and our LSS has diameter larger than some
dimension of the 3-torus, then the LSS will intersect copies of itself, and
the matching circles would be diametrically opposed to one another on
the LSS. Suppose our Dirichlet domain in a 3-torus universe is an

If the size is right, all six compact orientable Euclidean 3-manifolds would
have matching circles that are diametrically opposed to one another on the
LSS. The phase shift on these matching circles will be non-zero if the faces are
identied with a rotation.

Example 8.3.3: LSS in a PoincarÃ© dodecahedral space.
If we live in a PoincarÃ© dodecahedral space and our LSS is large enough,
we might see six pairs of matching circles, each pair consisting of
diametrically opposed circles in the sky with matching temperature
distributions after a relative phase shift of

36â¦ .

In general, the matching circles we (might) see can depend not only on the
shape of the universe, but also on where we happen to be in the universe.
This follows because the Dirichlet domain can vary from point to point
(see Example 7.7.14 for the two-dimensional case).

Of the 10 Euclidean 3-

manifolds, only the 3-torus has the feature that the Dirichlet domain is location
independent. Some (but not all) elliptic 3-manifolds have this feature, and in
any hyperbolic 3-manifold, the Dirichlet domain depends on your location.
Thus, if we do observe matching circles, it can not only reveal topology but
also the Earth's location in the universe.
Searches to date have focused on circles that are diametrically opposed to
one another on the LSS (or nearly so).

This restriction reduces the search

space from six parameters to four. Happily, most detectable universe shapes
would have matching circles diametrically opposite one another, or nearly so.
At the time of this writing, no matching circles have been found, and this
negative result places bounds on the size of our universe.

For instance, an

article written by the people who rst realized a small nite universe would
imprint itself on the LSS [19], concludes from the absence of matching circles
that the universe has topology scale (i.e., injectivity radius
24 gigaparsecs, which works out to

24 Ã 3.26 Ã 109 â 78

rinj )

bigger than

billion light-years. So,

a geodesic closed path trip in the universe would be at least 156 billion light
years long.
This stupendous distance is hard to fathom, but it appears safe to say
that we might abandon the possibility of gazing into the heavens and seeing a
distant image of our beloved Milky Way Galaxy.
In addition to [19], other accessible papers have been written on the circlesin-the-sky method, as well as the cosmic crystallography method.

The

Our Universe

Our universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic. The presence of cosmic
microwave background radiation is evidence of this: it is coming to us from
every direction with more or less constant temperature. This uniformity can
be explained by the inationary universe theory. The theory, pioneered in the
1980s by Alan Guth and others, states that during the rst

10â30

seconds (or

8.4.

Our Universe

199

so) after the big bang, the universe expanded at a stupendous rate, causing
the universe to appear homogeneous, isotropic, and also at.
The assumptions of isotropy and homogeneity are remarkably fruitful when
one approaches the geometry and topology of the universe from a mathematical
point of view.

Under these assumptions, three possibilities exist for the

geometry of the universe - the three geometries that have been the focus of
this text. Each geometry type has possible universe shapes attached to it, and
Section 8.1 showcases some of the leading compact candidates.
The mathematical point of view gives us our candidate geometries, but
attempts at detecting the geometry from the mathematical theory have proved
unsuccessful.

For instance, no enormous, cosmic triangle involving parallax

has produced an angle sum suciently dierent from

Ï

radians to rule out

Euclidean geometry.
Adopting a physical point of view, we have another way to approach the
geometry of the universe.

Einstein's theory of general relativity ties the

geometry of the universe to its mass-energy content.

If the universe has a

high mass-energy content, then the universe will have elliptic geometry. If the
universe has a low mass-energy content, then it will be hyperbolic. If it has
just a precise amount, called the critical mass density, the universe will be
Euclidean. From a naive point of view, this makes it seem highly unlikely that
our universe is Euclidean.

If our mass-energy content deviates by the mass

of just one hydrogen atom from this critical amount, our universe fails to be
Euclidean.
A little notation might be helpful. It turns out that from Einstein's eld
equations, the mass-energy density of the universe,

k

Ï, is related to its curvature

by the following equation, called the Friedmann Equation:

200

8. Cosmic Topology

of the universe put the value of

â¦

at about 1/3, contrary to the value of 1

predicted by the inationary universe model.
But at the dawn of the 21st century, this all changed with detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the remarkable
discovery that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate.

1

Careful analysis of the WMAP data on the cosmic background radiation

suggests that the universe is at, or nearly so, in agreement with the theory of
ination. (This analysis is dierent than the circles in the sky method, which
searches for shape.) The ve-year estimate from the WMAP data (see [21])
put the value of

â¦

at

â¦ = 1.0045 Â± .013.
So if the mass-energy density is about 1/3 of what is required to get us
to a Euclidean universe, but it appears from the CMB that the universe is
Euclidean, or nearly so, some other form of energy must exist. Evidence for
this was presented in 1999 (see, for instance, [18]) in the form of observations
of distant exploding stars called Type Ia supernovae. These distant supernovea
are fainter than expected for a universe whose expansion rate is slowing down,
suggesting that the universe is accelerating its expansion.

In 2011, Saul

Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt, and Adam Riess won the Nobel Prize in Physics
for their work on this discovery.
When Einstein rst proposed the 3-sphere as the shape of the universe,
his theory predicted that the 3-sphere should be expanding or collapsing. The
idea of a static universe appealed to him, and he added a constant into his
eld equations, called the cosmological constant, whose role was to counteract
gravity and prevent the universe from collapsing in on itself. But at roughly the
same time, Edwin Hubble, Vesto Slipher and others discovered that galaxies
in every direction were receding from us. Moreover, galaxies farther away were
receding at a faster rate, implying that the universe is expanding.

Einstein

withdrew his constant.
But now the constant has new life, as it can represent the repulsive dark
energy that seems to be counteracting gravity and driving the accelerated
expansion of the universe. So the density parameter in the Friedmann equation

ÏM ,

can have two components:

which is the mass-energy density associated

with ordinary and dark matter (the mass-energy density that cosmologists
have been estimating by observation); and

ÏÎ ,

which is the dark energy, due

to the cosmological constant. In this case, Friedmann's equation becomes

As the universe evolves, the values of the

density parameters may change, though the sum will always equal one.
Now is probably as good a time as any to tell you that the fate of the
universe is tied to its mass-energy content and the nature of the dark energy,
which is tied to the the geometry of the universe, which is tied to the topology
of the universe.
If the cosmological constant is zero then the relationship is simple: if

â¦>1

so that we live in an elliptic 3-manifolds, the universe will eventually begin to
fall back on itself, ultimately experiencing a big crunch. If

â¦ = 1,

a nite

Euclidean universe will have one of 10 possible shapes (6 if we insist on an
orientable universe) and its expansion rate will asymptotically approach 0, but
it will never begin collapsing. If

â¦ < 1,

the universe will continue to expand

until everything is so spread out we will experience a big chill.
With a nontrivial vacuum energy the situation changes.

While the

gravitational force due to the usual mass-energy content of the universe tends
to slow the expansion of the universe, it seems the dark energy causes it to
accelerate.

Whether the universe is hyperbolic, elliptic, or Euclidean, if the

dark energy wins the tug of war with gravity, the curvature of the universe
would approach 0 as it continued to accelerate its expansion, and the density
of matter in the universe would approach 0.
The European Space Agency launched the Planck satellite in 2009. In its
orbit at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, the Planck satellite
has given us improved measurements of the CMB temperature, enabling
sharper estimates of cosmological parameters, as well as more rened data
on which to run circles-in-the-sky tests. Alas, no circles have been detected.
Regarding the curvature of the universe, the Planck team concludes in [17], in
agreement with the WMAP team, that our universe appears to be at to a one
standard deviation accuracy of

0.25%.

In short, the universe appears to be homogeneous, isotropic, nearly at, and
dominated by dark energy. The current estimates for

â¦k

leave the question of

the geometry of the universe open, though just barely. It is still possible that
our universe is a hyperbolic or an elliptic manifold, but the curvature would
have to be very close to 0. If the universe is a compact, orientable Euclidean
manifold, we have six dierent possibilities for its shape.

Since Euclidean

manifold volumes aren't xed by curvature, there is no reason to expect the
dimensions of a Euclidean manifold to be close to the radius of the observable
universe.

But if the size is right, the circles-in-the-sky method would reveal

the shape of the universe through matching circles.
Perhaps we will be treated to matching circles some day.

Perhaps not.

Perhaps the universe is just too big. In any event, pursuing the question of the
shape of the universe is a remarkable feat of the human intellect. It is inspiring
to think, especially looking up at a clear, star lled night sky, that we might
be able to determine the shape of our universe, all without leaving our tiny
planet.
