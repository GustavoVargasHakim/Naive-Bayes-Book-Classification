Preface
This is a book on linear algebra and matrix theory. While it is self contained, it will work
best for those who have already had some exposure to linear algebra. It is also assumed that
the reader has had calculus. Some optional topics require more analysis than this, however.
I think that the subject of linear algebra is likely the most signiﬁcant topic discussed in
undergraduate mathematics courses. Part of the reason for this is its usefulness in unifying
so many diﬀerent topics. Linear algebra is essential in analysis, applied math, and even in
theoretical mathematics. This is the point of view of this book, more than a presentation
of linear algebra for its own sake. This is why there are numerous applications, some fairly
unusual.
This book features an ugly, elementary, and complete treatment of determinants early
in the book. Thus it might be considered as Linear algebra done wrong. I have done this
because of the usefulness of determinants. However, all major topics are also presented in
an alternative manner which is independent of determinants.
The book has an introduction to various numerical methods used in linear algebra.
This is done because of the interesting nature of these methods. The presentation here
emphasizes the reasons why they work. It does not discuss many important numerical
considerations necessary to use the methods eﬀectively. These considerations are found in
numerical analysis texts.
In the exercises, you may occasionally see ↑ at the beginning. This means you ought to
have a look at the exercise above it. Some exercises develop a topic sequentially. There are
also a few exercises which appear more than once in the book. I have done this deliberately
because I think that these illustrate exceptionally important topics and because some people
don’t read the whole book from start to ﬁnish but instead jump in to the middle somewhere.
There is one on a theorem of Sylvester which appears no fewer than 3 times. Then it is also
proved in the text. There are multiple proofs of the Cayley Hamilton theorem, some in the
exercises. Some exercises also are included for the sake of emphasizing something which has
been done in the preceding chapter.

Sets And Set Notation

A set is just a collection of things called elements. For example {1, 2, 3, 8} would be a set
consisting of the elements 1,2,3, and 8. To indicate that 3 is an element of {1, 2, 3, 8} , it is
customary to write 3 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 8} . 9 ∈
/ {1, 2, 3, 8} means 9 is not an element of {1, 2, 3, 8} .
Sometimes a rule speciﬁes a set. For example you could specify a set as all integers larger
than 2. This would be written as S = {x ∈ Z : x > 2} . This notation says: the set of all
integers, x, such that x > 2.
If A and B are sets with the property that every element of A is an element of B, then A is
a subset of B. For example, {1, 2, 3, 8} is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8} , in symbols, {1, 2, 3, 8} ⊆
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8} . It is sometimes said that “A is contained in B” or even “B contains A”.
The same statement about the two sets may also be written as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8} ⊇ {1, 2, 3, 8}.
The union of two sets is the set consisting of everything which is an element of at least
one of the sets, A or B. As an example of the union of two sets {1, 2, 3, 8} ∪ {3, 4, 7, 8} =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8} because these numbers are those which are in at least one of the two sets. In
general
A ∪ B ≡ {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B} .
Be sure you understand that something which is in both A and B is in the union. It is not
an exclusive or.
The intersection of two sets, A and B consists of everything which is in both of the sets.
Thus {1, 2, 3, 8} ∩ {3, 4, 7, 8} = {3, 8} because 3 and 8 are those elements the two sets have
in common. In general,
A ∩ B ≡ {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B} .
The symbol [a, b] where a and b are real numbers, denotes the set of real numbers x,
such that a ≤ x ≤ b and [a, b) denotes the set of real numbers such that a ≤ x < b. (a, b)
consists of the set of real numbers x such that a < x < b and (a, b] indicates the set of
numbers x such that a < x ≤ b. [a, ∞) means the set of all numbers x such that x ≥ a and
(−∞, a] means the set of all real numbers which are less than or equal to a. These sorts of
sets of real numbers are called intervals. The two points a and b are called endpoints of the
interval. Other intervals such as (−∞, b) are deﬁned by analogy to what was just explained.
In general, the curved parenthesis indicates the end point it sits next to is not included
while the square parenthesis indicates this end point is included. The reason that there
will always be a curved parenthesis next to ∞ or −∞ is that these are not real numbers.
Therefore, they cannot be included in any set of real numbers.
A special set which needs to be given a name is the empty set also called the null set,
denoted by ∅. Thus ∅ is deﬁned as the set which has no elements in it. Mathematicians like
to say the empty set is a subset of every set. The reason they say this is that if it were not

PRELIMINARIES

so, there would have to exist a set A, such that ∅ has something in it which is not in A.
However, ∅ has nothing in it and so the least intellectual discomfort is achieved by saying
∅ ⊆ A.
If A and B are two sets, A \ B denotes the set of things which are in A but not in B.
Thus
A \ B ≡ {x ∈ A : x ∈
/ B} .
Set notation is used whenever convenient.

1.2

Functions

The concept of a function is that of something which gives a unique output for a given input.
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 Consider two sets, D and R along with a rule which assigns a unique
element of R to every element of D. This rule is called a function and it is denoted by a
letter such as f. Given x ∈ D, f (x) is the name of the thing in R which results from doing
f to x. Then D is called the domain of f. In order to specify that D pertains to f , the
notation D (f ) may be used. The set R is sometimes called the range of f. These days it
is referred to as the codomain. The set of all elements of R which are of the form f (x)
for some x ∈ D is therefore, a subset of R. This is sometimes referred to as the image of
f . When this set equals R, the function f is said to be onto, also surjective. If whenever
x ̸= y it follows f (x) ̸= f (y), the function is called one to one. , also injective It is
common notation to write f : D 7→ R to denote the situation just described in this deﬁnition
where f is a function deﬁned on a domain D which has values in a codomain R. Sometimes
f
you may also see something like D 7→ R to denote the same thing.

1.3

The Number Line And Algebra Of The Real Numbers

Next, consider the real numbers, denoted by R, as a line extending inﬁnitely far in both
directions. In this book, the notation, ≡ indicates something is being deﬁned. Thus the
integers are deﬁned as
Z ≡ {· · · − 1, 0, 1, · · · } ,
the natural numbers,
N ≡ {1, 2, · · · }
and the rational numbers, deﬁned as the numbers which are the quotient of two integers.

the following algebra properties, listed here as a collection of assertions called axioms. These
properties will not be proved which is why they are called axioms rather than theorems. In
general, axioms are statements which are regarded as true. Often these are things which
are “self evident” either from experience or from some sort of intuition but this does not
have to be the case.
Axiom 1.3.1 x + y = y + x, (commutative law for addition)
Axiom 1.3.2 x + 0 = x, (additive identity).
Axiom 1.3.3 For each x ∈ R, there exists −x ∈ R such that x + (−x) = 0, (existence of
additive inverse).
Axiom 1.3.4 (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) , (associative law for addition).
Axiom 1.3.5 xy = yx, (commutative law for multiplication).
Axiom 1.3.6 (xy) z = x (yz) , (associative law for multiplication).
Axiom 1.3.7 1x = x, (multiplicative identity).
Axiom 1.3.8 For each x ̸= 0, there exists x−1 such that xx−1 = 1.(existence of multiplicative inverse).
Axiom 1.3.9 x (y + z) = xy + xz.(distributive law).
These axioms are known as the ﬁeld axioms and any set (there are many others besides
R) which has two such operations satisfying the above axioms is called a ﬁeld.
and
( Division
)
subtraction are deﬁned in the usual way by x − y ≡ x + (−y) and x/y ≡ x y −1 .
Here is a little proposition which derives some familiar facts.
Proposition 1.3.10 0 and 1 are unique. Also −x is unique and x−1 is unique. Furthermore, 0x = x0 = 0 and −x = (−1) x.
Proof: Suppose 0′ is another additive identity. Then
0′ = 0′ + 0 = 0.
Thus 0 is unique. Say 1′ is another multiplicative identity. Then
1 = 1′ 1 = 1′ .
Now suppose y acts like the additive inverse of x. Then
−x = (−x) + 0 = (−x) + (x + y) = (−x + x) + y = y
Finally,
0x = (0 + 0) x = 0x + 0x
and so
0 = − (0x) + 0x = − (0x) + (0x + 0x) = (− (0x) + 0x) + 0x = 0x
Finally
x + (−1) x = (1 + (−1)) x = 0x = 0
and so by uniqueness of the additive inverse, (−1) x = −x. 

1.4

Ordered ﬁelds

The real numbers R are an example of an ordered ﬁeld. More generally, here is a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.4.1 Let F be a ﬁeld. It is an ordered ﬁeld if there exists an order, < which
satisﬁes
1. For any x ̸= y, either x < y or y < x.
2. If x < y and either z < w or z = w, then, x + z < y + w.
3. If 0 < x, 0 < y, then xy > 0.
With this deﬁnition, the familiar properties of order can be proved. The following
proposition lists many of these familiar properties. The relation ‘a > b’ has the same
meaning as ‘b < a’.
Proposition 1.4.2 The following are obtained.
1. If x < y and y < z, then x < z.
2. If x > 0 and y > 0, then x + y > 0.
3. If x > 0, then −x < 0.
4. If x ̸= 0, either x or −x is > 0.
5. If x < y, then −x > −y.
6. If x ̸= 0, then x2 > 0.
7. If 0 < x < y then x−1 > y −1 .
Proof: First consider 1, called the transitive law. Suppose that x < y and y < z. Then
from the axioms, x + y < y + z and so, adding −y to both sides, it follows
x<z
Next consider 2. Suppose x > 0 and y > 0. Then from 2,
0 = 0 + 0 < x + y.
Next consider 3. It is assumed x > 0 so
0 = −x + x > 0 + (−x) = −x
Now consider 4. If x < 0, then
0 = x + (−x) < 0 + (−x) = −x.
Consider the 5. Since x < y, it follows from 2
0 = x + (−x) < y + (−x)
and so by 4 and Proposition 1.3.10,
(−1) (y + (−x)) < 0

1.5. THE COMPLEX NUMBERS

15

Also from Proposition 1.3.10 (−1) (−x) = − (−x) = x and so
−y + x < 0.
Hence
−y < −x.
Consider 6. If x > 0, there is nothing to show. It follows from the deﬁnition. If x < 0,
then by 4, −x > 0 and so by Proposition 1.3.10 and the deﬁnition of the order,
2

(−x) = (−1) (−1) x2 > 0
By this proposition again, (−1) (−1) = − (−1) = 1 and so x2 > 0 as claimed. Note that
1 > 0 because it equals 12 .
Finally, consider 7. First, if x > 0 then if x−1 < 0, it would follow (−1) x−1 > 0 and so
x (−1) x−1 = (−1) 1 = −1 > 0. However, this would require
0 > 1 = 12 > 0
from what was just shown. Therefore, x−1 > 0. Now the assumption implies y + (−1) x > 0
and so multiplying by x−1 ,
yx−1 + (−1) xx−1 = yx−1 + (−1) > 0
Now multiply by y −1 , which by the above satisﬁes y −1 > 0, to obtain
x−1 + (−1) y −1 > 0
and so

x−1 > y −1 . 

In an ordered ﬁeld the symbols ≤ and ≥ have the usual meanings. Thus a ≤ b means
a < b or else a = b, etc.

1.5

The Complex Numbers

Just as a real number should be considered as a point on the line, a complex number is
considered a point in the plane which can be identiﬁed in the usual way using the Cartesian
coordinates of the point. Thus (a, b) identiﬁes a point whose x coordinate is a and whose
y coordinate is b. In dealing with complex numbers, such a point is written as a + ib and
multiplication and addition are deﬁned in the most obvious way subject to the convention
that i2 = −1. Thus,
(a + ib) + (c + id) = (a + c) + i (b + d)
and
(a + ib) (c + id)

= ac + iad + ibc + i2 bd
= (ac − bd) + i (bc + ad) .

Every non zero complex number, a+ib, with a2 +b2 ̸= 0, has a unique multiplicative inverse.

Theorem 1.5.1 The complex numbers with multiplication and addition deﬁned as above
form a ﬁeld satisfying all the ﬁeld axioms listed on Page 13.

√
such that this ordered pair equals (cos θ, sin θ) . Letting r = x2 + y 2 , it follows that the
complex number can be written in the form
x + iy = r (cos θ + i sin θ)
This is called the polar form of the complex number.
The ﬁeld of complex numbers is denoted as C. An important construction regarding
complex numbers is the complex conjugate denoted by a horizontal line above the number.
It is deﬁned as follows.
a + ib ≡ a − ib.
What it does is reﬂect a given complex number across the x axis. Algebraically, the following
formula is easy to obtain.
(
)
a + ib (a + ib) = a2 + b2 .
Deﬁnition 1.5.2 Deﬁne the absolute value of a complex number as follows.
√
|a + ib| ≡ a2 + b2 .
Thus, denoting by z the complex number, z = a + ib,
|z| = (zz)

With this deﬁnition, it is important to note the following. Be sure to verify this. It is
not too hard but you need to do it.
√

Remark 1.5.3 : Let z = a + ib and w = c + id. Then |z − w| = (a − c) + (b − d) . Thus
the distance between the point in the plane determined by the ordered pair, (a, b) and the
ordered pair (c, d) equals |z − w| where z and w are as just described.
For example, consider
the distance between (2, 5) and (1, 8) . From the distance formula
√
√
2
2
this distance equals (2 − 1) + (5 − 8) = 10. On the other hand, letting z = 2 + i5 and
√
w = 1 + i8, z − w = 1 − i3 and so (z − w) (z − w) = (1 − i3) (1 + i3) = 10 so |z − w| = 10,
the same thing obtained with the distance formula.

The polar form of the complex number is then

A fundamental identity is the formula of De Moivre which follows.
Theorem 1.5.4 Let r > 0 be given. Then if n is a positive integer,
n

[r (cos t + i sin t)] = rn (cos nt + i sin nt) .
Proof: It is clear the formula holds if n = 1. Suppose it is true for n.
[r (cos t + i sin t)]

n+1

n

= [r (cos t + i sin t)] [r (cos t + i sin t)]

which by induction equals
= rn+1 (cos nt + i sin nt) (cos t + i sin t)
= rn+1 ((cos nt cos t − sin nt sin t) + i (sin nt cos t + cos nt sin t))
= rn+1 (cos (n + 1) t + i sin (n + 1) t)
by the formulas for the cosine and sine of the sum of two angles. 
Corollary 1.5.5 Let z be a non zero complex number. Then there are always exactly k k th
roots of z in C.
Proof: Let z = x + iy and let z = |z| (cos t + i sin t) be the polar form of the complex
number. By De Moivre’s theorem, a complex number,
r (cos α + i sin α) ,
is a k th root of z if and only if
rk (cos kα + i sin kα) = |z| (cos t + i sin t) .
This requires rk = |z| and so r = |z|
This can only happen if

and also both cos (kα) = cos t and sin (kα) = sin t.

kα = t + 2lπ
for l an integer. Thus
α=

The real and complex numbers both are ﬁelds satisfying the axioms on Page 13 and it is
usually one of these two ﬁelds which is used in linear algebra. The numbers are often called
scalars. However, it turns out that all algebraic notions work for any ﬁeld and there are
many others. For this reason, I will often refer to the ﬁeld of scalars as F although F will
usually be either the real or complex numbers. If there is any doubt, assume it is the ﬁeld
of complex numbers which is meant. The reason the complex numbers are so signiﬁcant in
linear
is that they are algebraically complete. This means that every polynomial

Later in the book, proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra are given. However, here
is a simple explanation of why you should believe this theorem. The issue is whether there
exists z ∈ C such that p (z) = 0 for p (z) a polynomial having coeﬃcients in C. Dividing by
the leading coeﬃcient, we can assume that p (z) is of the form
p (z) = z n + an−1 z n−1 + · · · + a1 z + a0 , a0 ̸= 0.
If a0 = 0, there is nothing to prove. Denote by Cr the circle of radius r in the complex plane
which is centered at 0. Then if r is suﬃciently large and |z| = r, the term z n is far larger
than the rest of the polynomial. Thus, for r large enough, Ar = {p (z) : z ∈ Cr } describes
a closed curve which misses the inside of some circle having 0 as its center. Now shrink r.

Eventually, for r small enough, the non constant terms are negligible and so Ar is a curve
which is contained in some circle centered at a0 which has 0 in its outside.

r small
Thus it is reasonable to believe that for some r during this shrinking process, the set
Ar must hit 0. It follows that p (z) = 0 for some z. This is one of those arguments which
seems all right until you think about it too much. Nevertheless, it will suﬃce to see that
the fundamental theorem of algebra is at least very plausible. A complete proof is in an
appendix.

does this tell you about De Moivre’s theorem? Is there a profound diﬀerence between
raising numbers to integer powers and raising numbers to non integer powers?

Completeness of R

Recall the following important deﬁnition from calculus, completeness of R.
Deﬁnition 1.7.1 A non empty set, S ⊆ R is bounded above (below) if there exists x ∈ R
such that x ≥ (≤) s for all s ∈ S. If S is a nonempty set in R which is bounded above,
then a number, l which has the property that l is an upper bound and that every other upper
bound is no smaller than l is called a least upper bound, l.u.b. (S) or often sup (S) . If S is a
nonempty set bounded below, deﬁne the greatest lower bound, g.l.b. (S) or inf (S) similarly.
Thus g is the g.l.b. (S) means g is a lower bound for S and it is the largest of all lower
bounds. If S is a nonempty subset of R which is not bounded above, this information is
expressed by saying sup (S) = +∞ and if S is not bounded below, inf (S) = −∞.
Every existence theorem in calculus depends on some form of the completeness axiom.
Axiom 1.7.2 (completeness) Every nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded above
has a least upper bound and every nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded below has
a greatest lower bound.
It is this axiom which distinguishes Calculus from Algebra. A fundamental result about
sup and inf is the following.

1.8. WELL ORDERING AND ARCHIMEDEAN PROPERTY

21

Proposition 1.7.3 Let S be a nonempty set and suppose sup (S) exists. Then for every
δ > 0,
S ∩ (sup (S) − δ, sup (S)] ̸= ∅.
If inf (S) exists, then for every δ > 0,
S ∩ [inf (S) , inf (S) + δ) ̸= ∅.
Proof: Consider the ﬁrst claim. If the indicated set equals ∅, then sup (S) − δ is an
upper bound for S which is smaller than sup (S) , contrary to the deﬁnition of sup (S) as
the least upper bound. In the second claim, if the indicated set equals ∅, then inf (S) + δ
would be a lower bound which is larger than inf (S) contrary to the deﬁnition of inf (S). 

1.8

Well Ordering And Archimedean Property

Deﬁnition 1.8.1 A set is well ordered if every nonempty subset S, contains a smallest
element z having the property that z ≤ x for all x ∈ S.
Axiom 1.8.2 Any set of integers larger than a given number is well ordered.
In particular, the natural numbers deﬁned as
N ≡ {1, 2, · · · }
is well ordered.
The above axiom implies the principle of mathematical induction.
Theorem 1.8.3 (Mathematical induction) A set S ⊆ Z, having the property that a ∈ S
and n + 1 ∈ S whenever n ∈ S contains all integers x ∈ Z such that x ≥ a.
Proof: Let T ≡ ([a, ∞) ∩ Z) \ S. Thus T consists of all integers larger than or equal
to a which are not in S. The theorem will be proved if T = ∅. If T ̸= ∅ then by the well
ordering principle, there would have to exist a smallest element of T, denoted as b. It must
be the case that b > a since by deﬁnition, a ∈
/ T. Then the integer, b − 1 ≥ a and b − 1 ∈
/S
because if b − 1 ∈ S, then b − 1 + 1 = b ∈ S by the assumed property of S. Therefore,
b − 1 ∈ ([a, ∞) ∩ Z) \ S = T which contradicts the choice of b as the smallest element of T.
(b − 1 is smaller.) Since a contradiction is obtained by assuming T ̸= ∅, it must be the case
that T = ∅ and this says that everything in [a, ∞) ∩ Z is also in S. 

PRELIMINARIES

Deﬁnition 1.8.5 The Archimedean property states that whenever x ∈ R, and a > 0, there
exists n ∈ N such that na > x.
Proposition 1.8.6 R has the Archimedean property.
Proof: Suppose it is not true. Then there exists x ∈ R and a > 0 such that na ≤ x
for all n ∈ N. Let S = {na : n ∈ N} . By assumption, this is bounded above by x. By
completeness, it has a least upper bound y. By Proposition 1.7.3 there exists n ∈ N such
that
y − a < na ≤ y.
Then y = y − a + a < na + a = (n + 1) a ≤ y, a contradiction. 
Theorem 1.8.7 Suppose x < y and y − x > 1. Then there exists an integer l ∈ Z, such
that x < l < y. If x is an integer, there is no integer y satisfying x < y < x + 1.
Proof: Let x be the smallest positive integer. Not surprisingly, x = 1 but this can be
proved. If x < 1 then x2 < x contradicting the assertion that x is the smallest natural
number. Therefore, 1 is the smallest natural number. This shows there is no integer, y,
satisfying x < y < x + 1 since otherwise, you could subtract x and conclude 0 < y − x < 1
for some integer y − x.
Now suppose y − x > 1 and let
S ≡ {w ∈ N : w ≥ y} .
The set S is nonempty by the Archimedean property. Let k be the smallest element of S.
Therefore, k − 1 < y. Either k − 1 ≤ x or k − 1 > x. If k − 1 ≤ x, then
≤0

z }| {
y − x ≤ y − (k − 1) = y − k + 1 ≤ 1
contrary to the assumption that y − x > 1. Therefore, x < k − 1 < y. Let l = k − 1. 
It is the next theorem which gives the density of the rational numbers. This means that
for any real number, there exists a rational number arbitrarily close to it.
Theorem 1.8.8 If x < y then there exists a rational number r such that x < r < y.
Proof: Let n ∈ N be large enough that
n (y − x) > 1.
Thus (y − x) added to itself n times is larger than 1. Therefore,
n (y − x) = ny + n (−x) = ny − nx > 1.
It follows from Theorem 1.8.7 there exists m ∈ Z such that
nx < m < ny
and so take r = m/n. 
Deﬁnition 1.8.9 A set, S ⊆ R is dense in R if whenever a < b, S ∩ (a, b) ̸= ∅.
Thus the above theorem says Q is “dense” in R.

1.9. DIVISION AND NUMBERS

23

Theorem 1.8.10 Suppose 0 < a and let b ≥ 0. Then there exists a unique integer p and
real number r such that 0 ≤ r < a and b = pa + r.
Proof: Let S ≡ {n ∈ N : an > b} . By the Archimedean property this set is nonempty.
Let p + 1 be the smallest element of S. Then pa ≤ b because p + 1 is the smallest in S.
Therefore,
r ≡ b − pa ≥ 0.
If r ≥ a then b − pa ≥ a and so b ≥ (p + 1) a contradicting p + 1 ∈ S. Therefore, r < a as
desired.
To verify uniqueness of p and r, suppose pi and ri , i = 1, 2, both work and r2 > r1 . Then
a little algebra shows
r2 − r1
∈ (0, 1) .
p1 − p2 =
a
Thus p1 − p2 is an integer between 0 and 1, contradicting Theorem 1.8.7. The case that
r1 > r2 cannot occur either by similar reasoning. Thus r1 = r2 and it follows that p1 = p2 .

This theorem is called the Euclidean algorithm when a and b are integers.

1.9

Division And Numbers

First recall Theorem 1.8.10, the Euclidean algorithm.
Theorem 1.9.1 Suppose 0 < a and let b ≥ 0. Then there exists a unique integer p and real
number r such that 0 ≤ r < a and b = pa + r.
The following deﬁnition describes what is meant by a prime number and also what is
meant by the word “divides”.
Deﬁnition 1.9.2 The number, a divides the number, b if in Theorem 1.8.10, r = 0. That
is there is zero remainder. The notation for this is a|b, read a divides b and a is called a
factor of b. A prime number is one which has the property that the only numbers which
divide it are itself and 1. The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, m, n is that
number, p which has the property that p divides both m and n and also if q divides both m
and n, then q divides p. Two integers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor
is one. The greatest common divisor of m and n is denoted as (m, n) .
There is a phenomenal and amazing theorem which relates the greatest common divisor
to the smallest number in a certain set. Suppose m, n are two positive integers. Then if x, y
are integers, so is xm + yn. Consider all integers which are of this form. Some are positive
such as 1m + 1n and some are not. The set S in the following theorem consists of exactly
those integers of this form which are positive. Then the greatest common divisor of m and
n will be the smallest number in S. This is what the following theorem says.
Theorem 1.9.3 Let m, n be two positive integers and deﬁne
S ≡ {xm + yn ∈ N : x, y ∈ Z } .
Then the smallest number in S is the greatest common divisor, denoted by (m, n) .

24

PRELIMINARIES

Proof: First note that both m and n are in S so it is a nonempty set of positive integers.
By well ordering, there is a smallest element of S, called p = x0 m + y0 n. Either p divides m
or it does not. If p does not divide m, then by Theorem 1.8.10,
m = pq + r
where 0 < r < p. Thus m = (x0 m + y0 n) q + r and so, solving for r,
r = m (1 − x0 ) + (−y0 q) n ∈ S.
However, this is a contradiction because p was the smallest element of S. Thus p|m. Similarly
p|n.
Now suppose q divides both m and n. Then m = qx and n = qy for integers, x and y.
Therefore,
p = mx0 + ny0 = x0 qx + y0 qy = q (x0 x + y0 y)
showing q|p. Therefore, p = (m, n) . 
There is a relatively simple algorithm for ﬁnding (m, n) which will be discussed now.
Suppose 0 < m < n where m, n are integers. Also suppose the greatest common divisor is
(m, n) = d. Then by the Euclidean algorithm, there exist integers q, r such that
n = qm + r, r < m

(1.1)

Now d divides n and m so there are numbers k, l such that dk = m, dl = n. From the above
equation,
r = n − qm = dl − qdk = d (l − qk)
Thus d divides both m and r. If k divides both m and r, then from the equation of (1.1)
it follows k also divides n. Therefore, k divides d by the deﬁnition of the greatest common
divisor. Thus d is the greatest common divisor of m and r but m + r < m + n. This yields
another pair of positive integers for which d is still the greatest common divisor but the
sum of these integers is strictly smaller than the sum of the ﬁrst two. Now you can do the
same thing to these integers. Eventually the process must end because the sum gets strictly
smaller each time it is done. It ends when there are not two positive integers produced.
That is, one is a multiple of the other. At this point, the greatest common divisor is the
smaller of the two numbers.
Procedure 1.9.4 To ﬁnd the greatest common divisor of m, n where 0 < m < n, replace
the pair {m, n} with {m, r} where n = qm + r for r < m. This new pair of numbers has
the same greatest common divisor. Do the process to this pair and continue doing this till
you obtain a pair of numbers where one is a multiple of the other. Then the smaller is the
sought for greatest common divisor.
Example 1.9.5 Find the greatest common divisor of 165 and 385.
Use the Euclidean algorithm to write
385 = 2 (165) + 55
Thus the next two numbers are 55 and 165. Then
165 = 3 × 55
and so the greatest common divisor of the ﬁrst two numbers is 55.

1.9. DIVISION AND NUMBERS

25

Example 1.9.6 Find the greatest common divisor of 1237 and 4322.
Use the Euclidean algorithm
4322 = 3 (1237) + 611
Now the two new numbers are 1237,611. Then
1237 = 2 (611) + 15
The two new numbers are 15,611. Then
611 = 40 (15) + 11
The two new numbers are 15,11. Then
15 = 1 (11) + 4
The two new numbers are 11,4
2 (4) + 3
The two new numbers are 4, 3. Then
4 = 1 (3) + 1
The two new numbers are 3, 1. Then
3=3×1
and so 1 is the greatest common divisor. Of course you could see this right away when the
two new numbers were 15 and 11. Recall the process delivers numbers which have the same
greatest common divisor.
This amazing theorem will now be used to prove a fundamental property of prime numbers which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the major theorem which says
every integer can be factored as a product of primes.
Theorem 1.9.7 If p is a prime and p|ab then either p|a or p|b.
Proof: Suppose p does not divide a. Then since p is prime, the only factors of p are 1
and p so follows (p, a) = 1 and therefore, there exists integers, x and y such that
1 = ax + yp.
Multiplying this equation by b yields
b = abx + ybp.
Since p|ab, ab = pz for some integer z. Therefore,
b = abx + ybp = pzx + ybp = p (xz + yb)
and this shows p divides b. 

Theorem 1.9.8 (Fundamental theorem of arithmetic) Let a ∈ N\ {1}. Then a = i=1 pi
where pi are all prime numbers. Furthermore, this prime factorization is unique except for
the order of the factors.

PRELIMINARIES

Proof: If a equals a prime number, the prime factorization clearly exists. In particular
the prime factorization exists for the prime number 2. Assume this theorem is true for all
a ≤ n − 1. If n is a prime, then it has a prime factorization. On the other hand, if n is not
a prime, then there exist two integers k and m such that n = km where each of k and m
are less than n. Therefore, each of these is no larger than n − 1 and consequently, each has
a prime factorization. Thus so does n. It remains to argue the prime factorization is unique
except for order of the factors.
Suppose

where the pi and qj are all prime, there is no way to reorder the qk such that m = n and
pi = qi for all i, and n + m is the smallest positive integer such that this happens. Then
by Theorem 1.9.7, p1 |qj for some j. Since these are prime numbers this requires p1 = qj .
Reordering if necessary it can be assumed that qj = q1 . Then dividing both sides by p1 = q1 ,

Since n + m was as small as possible for the theorem to fail, it follows that n − 1 = m − 1
and the prime numbers, q2 , · · · , qm can be reordered in such a way that pk = qk for all
k = 2, · · · , n. Hence pi = qi for all i because it was already argued that p1 = q1 , and this
results in a contradiction. 

1.10

Systems Of Equations

Sometimes it is necessary to solve systems of equations. For example the problem could be
to ﬁnd x and y such that
x + y = 7 and 2x − y = 8.
(1.2)
The set of ordered pairs, (x, y) which solve both equations is called the solution set. For
example, you can see that (5, 2) = (x, y) is a solution to the above system. To solve this,
note that the solution set does not change if any equation is replaced by a non zero multiple
of itself. It also does not change if one equation is replaced by itself added to a multiple
of the other equation. For example, x and y solve the above system if and only if x and y
solve the system
−3y=−6

z
}|
{
x + y = 7, 2x − y + (−2) (x + y) = 8 + (−2) (7).

(1.3)

The second equation was replaced by −2 times the ﬁrst equation added to the second. Thus
the solution is y = 2, from −3y = −6 and now, knowing y = 2, it follows from the other
equation that x + 2 = 7 and so x = 5.
Why exactly does the replacement of one equation with a multiple of another added to
it not change the solution set? The two equations of (1.2) are of the form
E 1 = f1 , E 2 = f2

(1.4)

where E1 and E2 are expressions involving the variables. The claim is that if a is a number,
then (1.4) has the same solution set as
E1 = f1 , E2 + aE1 = f2 + af1 .

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/

(1.5)

The Saylor Foundation

1.10. SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS

27

Why is this?
If (x, y) solves (1.4) then it solves the ﬁrst equation in (1.5). Also, it satisﬁes aE1 = af1
and so, since it also solves E2 = f2 it must solve the second equation in (1.5). If (x, y)
solves (1.5) then it solves the ﬁrst equation of (1.4). Also aE1 = af1 and it is given that
the second equation of (1.5) is veriﬁed. Therefore, E2 = f2 and it follows (x, y) is a solution
of the second equation in (1.4). This shows the solutions to (1.4) and (1.5) are exactly the
same which means they have the same solution set. Of course the same reasoning applies
with no change if there are many more variables than two and many more equations than
two. It is still the case that when one equation is replaced with a multiple of another one
added to itself, the solution set of the whole system does not change.
The other thing which does not change the solution set of a system of equations consists
of listing the equations in a diﬀerent order. Here is another example.
Example 1.10.1 Find the solutions to the system,
x + 3y + 6z = 25
2x + 7y + 14z = 58
2y + 5z = 19

(1.6)

To solve this system replace the second equation by (−2) times the ﬁrst equation added
to the second. This yields. the system
x + 3y + 6z = 25
y + 2z = 8
2y + 5z = 19

(1.7)

Now take (−2) times the second and add to the third. More precisely, replace the third
equation with (−2) times the second added to the third. This yields the system
x + 3y + 6z = 25
y + 2z = 8
z=3

(1.8)

At this point, you can tell what the solution is. This system has the same solution as the
original system and in the above, z = 3. Then using this in the second equation, it follows
y + 6 = 8 and so y = 2. Now using this in the top equation yields x + 6 + 18 = 25 and so
x = 1.
This process is not really much diﬀerent from what you have always done in solving a
single equation. For example, suppose you wanted to solve 2x + 5 = 3x − 6. You did the
same thing to both sides of the equation thus preserving the solution set until you obtained
an equation which was simple enough to give the answer. In this case, you would add −2x
to both sides and then add 6 to both sides. This yields x = 11.
In (1.8) you could have continued as follows. Add (−2) times the bottom equation to
the middle and then add (−6) times the bottom to the top. This yields
x + 3y = 19
y=6
z=3
Now add (−3) times the second to the top. This yields
x=1
y=6 ,
z=3

PRELIMINARIES

a system which has the same solution set as the original system.
It is foolish to write the variables every time you do these operations. It is easier to
write the system (1.6) as the following “augmented matrix”


1 3 6 25
 2 7 14 58  .
0 2 5 19
It has exactly 
the same
it is understood there is
 informationas the
original system but
 here

an x column,  2  , a y column,  7  and a z column,  14  . The rows correspond
0
2
5
to the equations in the system. Thus the top row in the augmented matrix corresponds to
the equation,
x + 3y + 6z = 25.
Now when you replace an equation with a multiple of another equation added to itself, you
are just taking a row of this augmented matrix and replacing it with a multiple of another
row added to it. Thus the ﬁrst step in solving (1.6) would be to take (−2) times the ﬁrst
row of the augmented matrix above and add it to the second row,


1 3 6 25
 0 1 2 8 .
0 2 5 19
Note how this corresponds to (1.7). Next take (−2) times the second row and add to the
third,


1 3 6 25
 0 1 2 8 
0 0 1 3
which is the same as (1.8). You get the idea I hope. Write the system as an augmented
matrix and follow the procedure of either switching rows, multiplying a row by a non zero
number, or replacing a row by a multiple of another row added to it. Each of these operations
leaves the solution set unchanged. These operations are called row operations.
Deﬁnition 1.10.2 The row operations consist of the following
1. Switch two rows.
2. Multiply a row by a nonzero number.
3. Replace a row by a multiple of another row added to it.
It is important to observe that any row operation can be “undone” by another inverse
row operation. For example, if r1 , r2 are two rows, and r2 is replaced with r′2 = αr1 + r2
using row operation 3, then you could get back to where you started by replacing the row r′2
with −α times r1 and adding to r′2 . In the case of operation 2, you would simply multiply
the row that was changed by the inverse of the scalar which multiplied it in the ﬁrst place,
and in the case of row operation 1, you would just make the same switch again and you
would be back to where you started. In each case, the row operation which undoes what
was done is called the inverse row operation.
Example 1.10.3 Give the complete solution to the system of equations, 5x+10y−7z = −2,
2x + 4y − 3z = −1, and 3x + 6y + 5z = 9.

Multiply the second row by 2, the ﬁrst row by 5, and then take (−1) times the ﬁrst row and



2 4 −3 −1
 0 0 1

Now, combining some row operations, take (−3) times the ﬁrst row and add this to 2 times

 0 0 1

0 0 1

Putting in the variables, the last two rows say z = 1 and z = 21. This is impossible so
the last system of equations determined by the above augmented matrix has no solution.
However, it has the same solution set as the ﬁrst system of equations. This shows there is no
solution to the three given equations. When this happens, the system is called inconsistent.
This should not be surprising that something like this can take place. It can even happen
for one equation in one variable. Consider for example, x = x+1. There is clearly no solution
to this.
Example 1.10.4 Give the complete solution to the system of equations, 3x − y − 5z = 9,
y − 10z = 0, and −2x + y = −6.

Next take −1 times the middle row and

and then divide the top row which results by 3.

This says y = 10z and x = 3 + 5z. Apparently z can equal any number. Therefore, the
solution set of this system is x = 3 + 5t, y = 10t, and z = t where t is completely arbitrary.
The system has an inﬁnite set of solutions and this is a good description of the solutions.
This is what it is all about, ﬁnding the solutions to the system.

PRELIMINARIES

Deﬁnition 1.10.5 Since z = t where t is arbitrary, the variable z is called a free variable.
The phenomenon of an inﬁnite solution set occurs in equations having only one variable
also. For example, consider the equation x = x. It doesn’t matter what x equals.
Deﬁnition 1.10.6 A system of linear equations is a list of equations,
n
∑

aij xj = fj , i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , m

j=1

where aij are numbers, fj is a number, and it is desired to ﬁnd (x1 , · · · , xn ) solving each of
the equations listed.
As illustrated above, such a system of linear equations may have a unique solution, no
solution, or inﬁnitely many solutions. It turns out these are the only three cases which can
occur for linear systems. Furthermore, you do exactly the same things to solve any linear
system. You write the augmented matrix and do row operations until you get a simpler
system in which it is possible to see the solution. All is based on the observation that the
row operations do not change the solution set. You can have more equations than variables,
fewer equations than variables, etc. It doesn’t matter. You always set up the augmented
matrix and go to work on it. These things are all the same.
Example 1.10.7 Give the complete solution to the system of equations, −41x + 15y = 168,
109x − 40y = −447, −3x + y = 12, and 2x + z = −1.
The augmented matrix is

To solve this multiply the top row by 109, the second row by 41, add the top row to the
second row, and multiply the top row by 1/109. Note how this process combined several
row operations. This yields

Next take 2 times the third row and replace the fourth row by this added to 3 times the
fourth row. Then take (−41) times the third row and replace the ﬁrst row by this added to
3 times the ﬁrst row. Then switch the third and the ﬁrst rows. This yields

Exercises

1. Give the complete solution to the system of equations, 3x − y + 4z = 6, y + 8z = 0,

3. Consider the system −5x + 2y − z = 0 and −5x − 2y − z = 0. Both equations equal
zero and so −5x + 2y − z = −5x − 2y − z which is equivalent to y = 0. Thus x and
z can equal anything. But when x = 1, z = −4, and y = 0 are plugged in to the
equations, it doesn’t work. Why?

PRELIMINARIES

Fn

The notation, Cn refers to the collection of ordered lists of n complex numbers. Since every
real number is also a complex number, this simply generalizes the usual notion of Rn , the
collection of all ordered lists of n real numbers. In order to avoid worrying about whether
it is real or complex numbers which are being referred to, the symbol F will be used. If it is
not clear, always pick C. More generally, Fn refers to the ordered lists of n elements of Fn .
Deﬁnition 1.12.1 Deﬁne Fn ≡ {(x1 , · · · , xn ) : xj ∈ F for j = 1, · · · , n} . (x1 , · · · , xn ) =
(y1 , · · · , yn ) if and only if for all j = 1, · · · , n, xj = yj . When (x1 , · · · , xn ) ∈ Fn , it is
conventional to denote (x1 , · · · , xn ) by the single bold face letter x. The numbers xj are
called the coordinates. The set
{(0, · · · , 0, t, 0, · · · , 0) : t ∈ F}
for t in the ith slot is called the ith coordinate axis. The point 0 ≡ (0, · · · , 0) is called the
origin.
Thus (1, 2, 4i) ∈ F3 and (2, 1, 4i) ∈ F3 but (1, 2, 4i) ̸= (2, 1, 4i) because, even though the
same numbers are involved, they don’t match up. In particular, the ﬁrst entries are not
equal.

1.13

Algebra in Fn

There are two algebraic operations done with elements of Fn . One is addition and the other
is multiplication by numbers, called scalars. In the case of Cn the scalars are complex
numbers while in the case of Rn the only allowed scalars are real numbers. Thus, the scalars
always come from F in either case.
Deﬁnition 1.13.1 If x ∈ Fn and a ∈ F, also called a scalar, then ax ∈ Fn is deﬁned by
ax = a (x1 , · · · , xn ) ≡ (ax1 , · · · , axn ) .

(1.9)

This is known as scalar multiplication. If x, y ∈ Fn then x + y ∈ Fn and is deﬁned by
x + y = (x1 , · · · , xn ) + (y1 , · · · , yn )
≡ (x1 + y1 , · · · , xn + yn )

(1.10)

With this deﬁnition, the algebraic properties satisfy the conclusions of the following
theorem.
Theorem 1.13.2 For v, w ∈ Fn and α, β scalars, (real numbers), the following hold.
v + w = w + v,

(1.11)

(v + w) + z = v+ (w + z) ,

In the above 0 = (0, · · · , 0).
You should verify that these properties all hold. As usual subtraction is deﬁned as
x − y ≡ x+ (−y) . The conclusions of the above theorem are called the vector space axioms.

1.15

The Inner Product In Fn

When F = R or C, there is something called an inner product. In case of R it is also called
the dot product. This is also often referred to as the scalar product.
Deﬁnition 1.15.1 Let a, b ∈ Fn deﬁne a · b as
a·b≡

n
∑

ak bk .

k=1

With this deﬁnition, there are several important properties satisﬁed by the inner product.
In the statement of these properties, α and β will denote scalars and a, b, c will denote
vectors or in other words, points in Fn .

34

PRELIMINARIES

Proposition 1.15.2 The inner product satisﬁes the following properties.
a · b =b · a

(1.19)

a · a ≥ 0 and equals zero if and only if a = 0

(1.20)

(αa + βb) · c =α (a · c) + β (b · c)

(1.21)

c · (αa + βb) = α (c · a) + β (c · b)

(1.22)

2

|a| = a · a

(1.23)

You should verify these properties. Also be sure you understand that (1.22) follows from
the ﬁrst three and is therefore redundant. It is listed here for the sake of convenience.
Example 1.15.3 Find (1, 2, 0, −1) · (0, i, 2, 3) .
This equals 0 + 2 (−i) + 0 + −3 = −3 − 2i
The Cauchy Schwarz inequality takes the following form in terms of the inner product.
I will prove it using only the above axioms for the inner product.
Theorem 1.15.4 The inner product satisﬁes the inequality
|a · b| ≤ |a| |b| .

(1.24)

Furthermore equality is obtained if and only if one of a or b is a scalar multiple of the other.
Proof: First deﬁne θ ∈ C such that
θ (a · b) = |a · b| , |θ| = 1,
and deﬁne a function of t ∈ R
f (t) = (a + tθb) · (a + tθb) .
Then by (1.20), f (t) ≥ 0 for all t ∈ R. Also from (1.21),(1.22),(1.19), and (1.23)
f (t) = a · (a + tθb) + tθb · (a + tθb)
2

= a · a + tθ (a · b) + tθ (b · a) + t2 |θ| b · b
2

2

2

2

= |a| + 2t Re θ (a · b) + |b| t2 = |a| + 2t |a · b| + |b| t2
2

Now if |b| = 0 it must be the case that a · b = 0 because otherwise, you could pick large
negative values of t and violate f (t) ≥ 0. Therefore, in this case, the Cauchy Schwarz
inequality holds. In the case that |b| ̸= 0, y = f (t) is a polynomial which opens up and
therefore, if it is always nonnegative, its graph is like that illustrated in the following picture

1.15. THE INNER PRODUCT IN FN

35

since otherwise the function, f (t) would have two real zeros and would necessarily have a
graph which dips below the t axis. This proves (1.24).
It is clear from the axioms of the inner product that equality holds in (1.24) whenever
one of the vectors is a scalar multiple of the other. It only remains to verify this is the only
way equality can occur. If either vector equals zero, then equality is obtained in (1.24) so
it can be assumed both vectors are non zero. Then if equality is achieved, it follows f (t)
has exactly one real zero because the discriminant vanishes. Therefore, for some value of
t, a + tθb = 0 showing that a is a multiple of b. 
You should note that the entire argument was based only on the properties of the inner product listed in (1.19) - (1.23). This means that whenever something satisﬁes these
properties, the Cauchy Schwartz inequality holds. There are many other instances of these
properties besides vectors in Fn . Also note that (1.24) holds if (1.20) is simpliﬁed to a·a ≥ 0.
The Cauchy Schwartz inequality allows a proof of the triangle inequality for distances
in Fn in much the same way as the triangle inequality for the absolute value.
Theorem 1.15.5 (Triangle inequality) For a, b ∈ Fn
|a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|

(1.25)

and equality holds if and only if one of the vectors is a nonnegative scalar multiple of the
other. Also
||a| − |b|| ≤ |a − b|
(1.26)
Proof : By properties of the inner product and the Cauchy Schwartz inequality,
2

|a + b| = (a + b) · (a + b) = (a · a) + (a · b) + (b · a) + (b · b)
2

2

2

= |a| + 2 Re (a · b) + |b| ≤ |a| + 2 |a · b| + |b|
2

2

2

2

≤ |a| + 2 |a| |b| + |b| = (|a| + |b|) .
Taking square roots of both sides you obtain (1.25).
It remains to consider when equality occurs. If either vector equals zero, then that
vector equals zero times the other vector and the claim about when equality occurs is
veriﬁed. Therefore, it can be assumed both vectors are nonzero. To get equality in the
second inequality above, Theorem 1.15.4 implies one of the vectors must be a multiple of
the other. Say b = αa. Also, to get equality in the ﬁrst inequality, (a · b) must be a
nonnegative real number. Thus
2

0 ≤ (a · b) = (a·αa) = α |a| .
Therefore, α must be a real number which is nonnegative.
To get the other form of the triangle inequality,
a=a−b+b
so
|a| = |a − b + b| ≤ |a − b| + |b| .
Therefore,
|a| − |b| ≤ |a − b|

(1.27)

|b| − |a| ≤ |b − a| = |a − b| .

(1.28)

Similarly,
It follows from (1.27) and (1.28) that (1.26) holds. This is because ||a| − |b|| equals the left
side of either (1.27) or (1.28) and either way, ||a| − |b|| ≤ |a − b| . 

What Is Linear Algebra?

The above preliminary considerations form the necessary scaﬀolding upon which linear algebra is built. Linear algebra is the study of a certain algebraic structure called a vector
space described in a special case in Theorem 1.13.2 and in more generality below along with
special functions known as linear transformations. These linear transformations preserve
certain algebraic properties.
A good argument could be made that linear algebra is the most useful subject in all
of mathematics and that it exceeds even courses like calculus in its signiﬁcance. It is used
extensively in applied mathematics and engineering. Continuum mechanics, for example,
makes use of topics from linear algebra in deﬁning things like the strain and in determining
appropriate constitutive laws. It is fundamental in the study of statistics. For example,
principal component analysis is really based on the singular value decomposition discussed
in this book. It is also fundamental in pure mathematics areas like number theory, functional
analysis, geometric measure theory, and diﬀerential geometry. Even calculus cannot be
correctly understood without it. For example, the derivative of a function of many variables
is an example of a linear transformation, and this is the way it must be understood as soon
as you consider functions of more than one variable.

2.1

Matrices

You have now solved systems of equations by writing them in terms of an augmented matrix
and then doing row operations on this augmented matrix. It turns out that such rectangular
arrays of numbers are important from many other diﬀerent points of view. Numbers are
also called scalars. In general, scalars are just elements of some ﬁeld. However, in the ﬁrst
part of this book, the ﬁeld will typically be either the real numbers or the complex numbers.
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Several of them are referred to as matrices.
For example, here is a matrix.


1 2 3 4
 5 2 8 7 
6 −9 1 2
This matrix is a 3 × 4 matrix because there are three rows and four columns.
 ﬁrst
 The
1
row is (1 2 3 4) , the second row is (5 2 8 7) and so forth. The ﬁrst column is  5  . The
6
convention in dealing with matrices is to always list the rows ﬁrst and then the columns.
Also, you can remember the columns are like columns in a Greek temple. They stand up
right while the rows just lay there like rows made by a tractor in a plowed ﬁeld. Elements of
the matrix are identiﬁed according to position in the matrix. For example, 8 is in position
2, 3 because it is in the second row and the third column. You might remember that you
always list the rows before the columns by using the phrase Rowman Catholic. The symbol,
(aij ) refers to a matrix in which the i denotes the row and the j denotes the column. Using
this notation on the above matrix, a23 = 8, a32 = −9, a12 = 2, etc.
There are various operations which are done on matrices. They can sometimes be added,
multiplied by a scalar and sometimes multiplied. To illustrate scalar multiplication, consider
the following example.

 

1 2 3 4

24 21  .
3  5 2 8 7  =  15
6 −9 1 2
18 −27 3
6
The new matrix is obtained by multiplying every entry of the original matrix by the given
scalar. If A is an m × n matrix −A is deﬁned to equal (−1) A.
Two matrices which are the same size can be added. When this is done, the result is the

adding corresponding entries. Thus

8  =  5 12  .

Two matrices are equal exactly when they are the same size and the corresponding entries
are identical. Thus


(
)
0 0

 0 0  ̸=

0 0
because they are diﬀerent sizes. As noted above, you write (cij ) for the matrix C whose
ij th entry is cij . In doing arithmetic with matrices you must deﬁne what happens in terms
of the cij sometimes called the entries of the matrix or the components of the matrix.
The above discussion stated for general matrices is given in the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.1.1 Let A = (aij ) and B = (bij ) be two m × n matrices. Then A + B = C
where
C = (cij )
for cij = aij + bij . Also if x is a scalar,
xA = (cij )
where cij = xaij . The number Aij will typically refer to the ij th entry of the matrix A. The
zero matrix, denoted by 0 will be the matrix consisting of all zeros.
Do not be upset by the use of the subscripts, ij. The expression cij = aij + bij is just
saying that you add corresponding entries to get the result of summing two matrices as
discussed above.
Note that there are 2 × 3 zero matrices, 3 × 4 zero matrices, etc. In fact for every size
there is a zero matrix.
With this deﬁnition, the following properties are all obvious but you should verify all of
these properties are valid for A, B, and C, m × n matrices and 0 an m × n zero matrix,
A + B = B + A,

(2.1)

(A + B) + C = A + (B + C) ,

(2.2)

the commutative law of addition,

the associative law for addition,
A + 0 = A,

(2.3)

A + (−A) = 0,

(2.4)

the existence of an additive identity,

the existence of an additive inverse. Also, for α, β scalars, the following also hold.
α (A + B) = αA + αB,

(2.5)

(α + β) A = αA + βA,

(2.6)

α (βA) = αβ (A) ,

(2.7)

1A = A.

(2.8)

The above properties, (2.1) - (2.8) are known as the vector space axioms and the fact
that the m × n matrices satisfy these axioms is what is meant by saying this set of matrices
with addition and scalar multiplication as deﬁned above forms a vector space.

x =  ... 
xn
is an n × 1 matrix also called a column vector while a 1 × n matrix of the form (x1 · · · xn )
is referred to as a row vector.
All the above is ﬁne, but the real reason for considering matrices is that they can be
multiplied. This is where things quit being banal.
First consider the problem of multiplying an m × n matrix by an n × 1 column vector.
Consider the following example

With this done, the next task is to multiply an m × n matrix times an n × p matrix.
Before doing so, the following may be helpful.
these must match

(m ×

[
n)
(n × p

)=m×p

If the two middle numbers don’t match, you can’t multiply the matrices!
Deﬁnition 2.1.5 Let A be an m × n matrix and let B be an n × p matrix. Then B is of
the form
B = (b1 , · · · , bp )
where bk is an n × 1 matrix. Then an m × p matrix AB is deﬁned as follows:
AB ≡ (Ab1 , · · · , Abp )

(2.10)

where Abk is an m × 1 matrix. Hence AB as just deﬁned is an m × p matrix. For example,

do the multiplication. The ﬁrst matrix is a 2 × 3 and the second matrix is a 3 × 3. Therefore,

match and so you can’t do this multiplication. This means that anything you write will be
absolute nonsense because it is impossible to multiply these matrices in this order. Aren’t
they the same two matrices considered in the previous example? Yes they are. It is just
that here they are in a diﬀerent order. This shows something you must always remember
about matrix multiplication.
Order Matters!
Matrix multiplication is not commutative. This is very diﬀerent than multiplication of
numbers!

There are three locations in this graph, labelled 1,2, and 3. The directed lines represent
a way of going from one location to another. Thus there is one way to go from location 1
to location 1. There is one way to go from location 1 to location 3. It is not possible to go

44

MATRICES AND LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

from location 2 to location 3 although it is possible to go from location 3 to location 2. Lets
refer to moving along one of these directed lines as a step. The following 3 × 3 matrix is
a numerical way of writing the above graph. This is sometimes called a digraph, short for
directed graph.


1 1 1
 1 0 0 
1 1 0
Thus aij , the entry in the ith row and j th column represents the number of ways to go from
location i to location j in one step.
Problem: Find the number of ways to go from i to j using exactly k steps.
Denote the answer to the above problem by akij . We don’t know what it is right now
unless k = 1 when it equals aij described above. However, if we did know what it was, we
could ﬁnd ak+1
as follows.
ij
∑
ak+1
=
akir arj
ij
r

This is because if you go from i to j in k + 1 steps, you ﬁrst go from i to r in k steps and
then for each of these ways there are arj ways to go from there to j. Thus akir arj gives
the number of ways to go from i to j in k + 1 steps such that the k th step leaves you at
location r. Adding these gives the above sum. Now you recognize this as the ij th entry of
the product of two matrices. Thus
∑
∑
a2ij =
air arj , a3ij =
a2ir arj
r

r

and so forth. From the above deﬁnition of matrix multiplication, this shows that if A is the
matrix associated with the directed graph as above, then akij is just the ij th entry of Ak
where Ak is just what you would think it should be, A multiplied by itself k times.
Thus in the above example, to ﬁnd the number of ways of going from 1 to 3 in two steps
you would take that matrix and multiply it by itself and then take the entry in the ﬁrst row
and third column. Thus

2 

1 1 1
3 2 1
 1 0 0  = 1 1 1 
1 1 0
2 1 1
and you see there is exactly one way to go from 1 to 3 in two steps. You can easily see this
is true from looking at the graph also. Note there are three ways to go from 1 to 1 in 2
steps. Can you ﬁnd them from the graph? What would you do if you wanted to consider 5
steps?

There are 19 ways to go from 1 to 2 in ﬁve steps. Do you think you could list them all by
looking at the graph? I don’t think you could do it without wasting a lot of time.
Of course there is nothing sacred about having only three locations. Everything works
just as well with any number of locations. In general if you have n locations, you would
need to use a n × n matrix.

If it acts like an inverse, then it is the inverse. This is the message of the following
proposition.
Proposition 2.1.23 Suppose AB = BA = I. Then B = A−1 .
Proof: From the deﬁnition B is an inverse for A. Could there be another one B ′ ?
B ′ = B ′ I = B ′ (AB) = (B ′ A) B = IB = B.
Thus, the inverse, if it exists, is unique. 

2.1.4

Finding The Inverse Of A Matrix

A little later a formula is given for the inverse of a matrix. However, it is not a good way
to ﬁnd the inverse for a matrix. There is a much easier way and it is this which is presented
here. It is also important to note that not all matrices have inverses.
(
)

Example 2.1.24 Let A =

One might think A would have an inverse because it does not equal zero. However,
(
)(

)
1 1

and if A−1 existed, this could not happen because you could multiply on the left by the
T
T
inverse A and conclude the vector (−1, 1) = (0, 0) . Thus the answer is that A does not
have an inverse.
Suppose you want to ﬁnd B such that AB = I. Let
(
)
B = b1 · · · bn
Also the ith column of I is
ei =

(

0

···

0

1

0 ···

0

)T

Thus, if AB = I, bi , the ith column of B must satisfy the equation Abi = ei . The augmented
matrix for ﬁnding bi is (A|ei ) . Thus, by doing row operations till A becomes I, you end up
with (I|bi ) where bi is the solution to Abi = ei . Now the same sequence of row operations
works regardless of the right side of the agumented matrix (A|ei ) and so you can save trouble
by simply doing the following.
(A|I)

row operations

→

(I|B)

and the ith column of B is bi , the solution to Abi = ei . Thus AB = I.
This is the reason for the following simple procedure for ﬁnding the inverse of a matrix.
This procedure is called the Gauss Jordan procedure. It produces the inverse if the matrix
has one. Actually, it produces the right inverse.
Procedure 2.1.25 Suppose A is an n × n matrix. To ﬁnd A−1 if it exists, form the
augmented n × 2n matrix,
(A|I)
and then do row operations until you obtain an n × 2n matrix of the form
(I|B)

(2.18)

if possible. When this has been done, B = A−1 . The matrix A has an inverse exactly when
it is possible to do row operations and end up with one like (2.18).

Here R−1 is the row operation which undoes the row operation R. Therefore, if you form
(B|I) and do the inverse of the row operations which produced I from A in the reverse
order, you would obtain (I|A) . By the same reasoning above, it follows that A is a right
inverse of B and so BA = I also. It follows from Proposition 2.1.23 that B = A−1 . Thus
the procedure produces the inverse whenever it works.
row operations
If it is possible to do row operations and end up with A
→
I, then the above
argument shows that A has an inverse. Conversely, if A has an inverse, can it be found by
the above procedure? In this case there exists a unique solution x to the equation Ax = y.
In fact it is just x = Ix = A−1 y. Thus in terms of augmented matrices, you would expect
to obtain
(
)
(A|y) → I|A−1 y
That is, you would expect to be able to do row operations to A and end up with I.
The details will be explained fully when a more careful discussion is given which is based
on more fundamental considerations. For now, it suﬃces to observe that whenever the above
procedure works, it ﬁnds the inverse.

Linear Transformations

By (2.13), if A is an m × n matrix, then for v, u vectors in Fn and a, b scalars,
 ∈Fn 
z }| {
A au + bv = aAu + bAv ∈ Fm

(2.19)

Deﬁnition 2.3.1 A function, A : Fn → Fm is called a linear transformation if for all
u, v ∈ Fn and a, b scalars, (2.19) holds.
From (2.19), matrix multiplication deﬁnes a linear transformation as just deﬁned. It
turns out this is the only type of linear transformation available. Thus if A is a linear
transformation from Fn to Fm , there is always a matrix which produces A. Before showing
this, here is a simple deﬁnition.

MATRICES AND LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

Deﬁnition 2.3.2 A vector, ei ∈ Fn is deﬁned as follows:
 
0
 .. 
 . 
 

ei ≡ 
 1 ,
 . 
 .. 
0
where the 1 is in the ith position and there are zeros everywhere else. Thus
T

ei = (0, · · · , 0, 1, 0, · · · , 0) .
Of course the ei for a particular value of i in Fn would be diﬀerent than the ei for that
same value of i in Fm for m ̸= n. One of them is longer than the other. However, which one
is meant will be determined by the context in which they occur.
These vectors have a signiﬁcant property.
Lemma 2.3.3 Let v ∈ Fn . Thus v is a list of numbers arranged vertically, v1 , · · · , vn . Then
eTi v = vi .

(2.20)

Also, if A is an m × n matrix, then letting ei ∈ Fm and ej ∈ Fn ,
eTi Aej = Aij

(2.21)

Proof: First note that eTi is a 1 × n matrix and v is an n × 1 matrix so the above
multiplication in (2.20) makes perfect sense. It equals



Stated in another way, the k th column of A equals Lek .

Proof: By the lemma,
(
)
(Lx)i = eTi Lx = eTi xk Lek = eTi Lek xk .
Let Aik = eTi Lek , to prove the existence part of the theorem.
To verify uniqueness, suppose Bx = Ax = Lx for all x ∈ Fn . Then in particular, this is
true for x = ej and then multiply on the left by eTi to obtain
Bij = eTi Bej = eTi Aej = Aij
showing A = B. 
Corollary 2.3.5 A linear transformation, L : Fn → Fm is completely determined by the
vectors {Le1 , · · · , Len } .
Proof: This follows immediately from the above theorem. The unique matrix determining the linear transformation which is given in (2.22) depends only on these vectors.

This theorem shows that any linear transformation deﬁned on Fn can always be considered as a matrix. Therefore, the terms “linear transformation” and “matrix” are often
used interchangeably. For example, to say that a matrix is one to one, means the linear
transformation determined by the matrix is one to one.

Deﬁnition 2.3.7 Let L : Fn → Fm be a linear transformation and let its matrix be the
m × n matrix A. Then ker (L) ≡ {x ∈ Fn : Lx = 0} . Sometimes people also write this as
N (A) , the null space of A.
Then there is a fundamental result in the case where m < n. In this case, the matrix A
of the linear transformation looks like the following.

Theorem 2.3.8 Let A be an m × n matrix where m < n. Then N (A) contains nonzero
vectors.
Proof: First consider the case where A is a 1 × n matrix for n > 1. Say
(
)
A = a1 · · · an
If a1 = 0, consider the vector x = e1 . If a1 ̸= 0, let

Suppose now that the theorem is true for any m × n matrix with n > m and consider an
(m × 1) × n matrix A where n > m + 1. If the ﬁrst column of A is 0, then you could let
x = e1 as above. If the ﬁrst column is not the zero vector, then by doing row operations,
the equation Ax = 0 can be reduced to the equivalent system
A1 x = 0
where A1 is of the form

(
A1 =

where B is an m × (n − 1) matrix. Since n > m + 1, it follows that (n − 1) > m and so
by induction, there exists a nonzero vector y ∈ Fn−1 such that By = 0. Then consider the

A1 x has for its top entry the expression b + aT y. Letting B =  ...  , the ith entry of

A1 x for i > 1 is of the form bTi y = 0. Thus if b is chosen to satisfy the equation b+aT y = 0,
then A1 x = 0.

Subspaces And Spans

Deﬁnition 2.4.1 Let {x1 , · · · , xp } be vectors in Fn . A linear combination is any expression
of the form
p
∑
ci xi
i=1

where the ci are scalars. The set of all linear combinations of these vectors is called
span (x1 , · · · , xn ) . If V ⊆ Fn , then V is called a subspace if whenever α, β are scalars
and u and v are vectors of V, it follows αu + βv ∈ V . That is, it is “closed under the
algebraic operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication”. A linear combination
of vectors is said to be trivial if all the scalars in the linear combination equal zero. A set
of vectors is said to be linearly independent if the only linear combination of these vectors
which equals the zero vector is the trivial linear combination. Thus {x1 , · · · , xn } is called
linearly independent if whenever
p
∑
ck xk = 0
k=1

it follows that all the scalars ck equal zero. A set of vectors, {x1 , · · · , xp } , is called linearly
dependent if it is not linearly independent. Thus the set∑
of vectors is linearly dependent if
p
there exist scalars ci , i = 1, · · · , n, not all zero such that k=1 ck xk = 0.
Proposition 2.4.2 Let V ⊆ Fn . Then V is a subspace if and only if it is a vector space
itself with respect to the same operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/

2.4. SUBSPACES AND SPANS

57

Proof: Suppose ﬁrst that V is a subspace. All algebraic properties involving scalar
multiplication and vector addition hold for V because these things hold for Fn . Is 0 ∈ V ? Yes
it is. This is because 0v ∈ V and 0v = 0. By assumption, for α a scalar and v ∈ V, αv ∈ V.
Therefore, −v = (−1) v ∈ V . Thus V has the additive identity and additive inverse. By
assumption, V is closed with respect to the two operations. Thus V is a vector space. If
V ⊆ Fn is a vector space, then by deﬁnition, if α, β are scalars and u, v vectors in V, it
follows that αv + βu ∈ V . 
Thus, from the above, subspaces of Fn are just subsets of Fn which are themselves vector
spaces.
Lemma 2.4.3 A set of vectors {x1 , · · · , xp } is linearly independent if and only if none of
the vectors can be obtained as a linear combination of the others.
∑
Proof: Suppose ﬁrst that {x1 , · · · , xp } is linearly independent. If xk = j̸=k cj xj , then
0 = 1xk +

∑

(−cj ) xj ,

j̸=k

a nontrivial linear combination, contrary to assumption. This shows that if the set is linearly
independent, then none of the vectors is a linear combination of the others.
Now suppose no vector is a linear combination of the others. Is {x1 , · · · , xp } linearly
independent? If it is not, there exist scalars ci , not all zero such that
p

ci xi = 0.

Say ck ̸= 0. Then you can solve for xk as

xk =

The following is called the exchange theorem.
Theorem 2.4.4 (Exchange Theorem) Let {x1 , · · · , xr } be a linearly independent set of vectors such that each xi is in span(y1 , · · · , ys ) . Then r ≤ s.
Proof 1: Suppose not. Then r > s. By assumption, there exist scalars aji such that
xi =

s
∑

aji yj

The matrix whose jith entry is aji has more columns than rows. Therefore, by Theorem

Deﬁne span{y1 , · · · , ys } ≡ V, it follows there exist scalars c1 , · · · , cs such
x1 =

ci yi .

(2.23)

i=1

Not all of these scalars can equal zero because if this were the case, it would follow that
x
∑1 r= 0 and so {x1 , · · · , xr } would not be linearly independent. Indeed, if x1 = 0, 1x1 +
i=2 0xi = x1 = 0 and so there would exist a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors
{x1 , · · · , xr } which equals zero.
Say ck ̸= 0. Then solve ((2.23)) for yk and obtain


s-1 vectors here
z
}|
{
yk ∈ span x1 , y1 , · · · , yk−1 , yk+1 , · · · , ys  .
Deﬁne {z1 , · · · , zs−1 } by
{z1 , · · · , zs−1 } ≡ {y1 , · · · , yk−1 , yk+1 , · · · , ys }
Therefore, span {x1 , z1 , · · · , zs−1 } = V because if v ∈ V, there exist constants c1 , · · · , cs
such that
s−1
∑
v=
ci zi + cs yk .
i=1

Now replace the yk in the above with a linear combination of the vectors, {x1 , z1 , · · · , zs−1 }
to obtain v ∈ span {x1 , z1 , · · · , zs−1 } . The vector yk , in the list {y1 , · · · , ys } , has now been
replaced with the vector x1 and the resulting modiﬁed list of vectors has the same span as
the original list of vectors, {y1 , · · · , ys } .
Now suppose that r > s and that span {x1 , · · · , xl , z1 , · · · , zp } = V where the vectors,
z1 , · · · , zp are each taken from the set, {y1 , · · · , ys } and l + p = s. This has now been done
for l = 1 above. Then since r > s, it follows that l ≤ s < r and so l + 1 ≤ r. Therefore, xl+1
is a vector not in the list, {x1 , · · · , xl } and since span {x1 , · · · , xl , z1 , · · · , zp } = V, there
exist scalars ci and dj such that
xl+1 =

l
∑
i=1

ci xi +

p
∑

dj zj .

(2.24)

j=1

Now not all the dj can equal zero because if this were so, it would follow that {x1 , · · · , xr }
would be a linearly dependent set because one of the vectors would equal a linear combination
of the others. Therefore, ((2.24)) can be solved for one of the zi , say zk , in terms of xl+1
and the other zi and just as in the above argument, replace that zi with xl+1 to obtain

Continue this way, eventually obtaining
span {x1 , · · · , xs } = V.
But then xr ∈ span {x1 , · · · , xs } contrary to the assumption that {x1 , · · · , xr } is linearly
independent. Therefore, r ≤ s as claimed.

2.4. SUBSPACES AND SPANS

Proof 3: Suppose r > s. Let zk denote a vector of {y1 , · · · , ys } . Thus there exists j as
small as possible such that
span (y1 , · · · , ys ) = span (x1 , · · · , xm , z1 , · · · , zj )
where m + j = s. It is given that m = 0, corresponding to no vectors of {x1 , · · · , xm } and
j = s, corresponding to all the yk results in the above equation holding. If j > 0 then m < s
and so
j

xm+1 =

Not all the bi can equal 0 and so you can solve for one of them in terms of xm+1 , xm , · · · , x1 ,
and the other zk . Therefore, there exists
{z1 , · · · , zj−1 } ⊆ {y1 , · · · , ys }
such that
span (y1 , · · · , ys ) = span (x1 , · · · , xm+1 , z1 , · · · , zj−1 )
contradicting the choice of j. Hence j = 0 and
span (y1 , · · · , ys ) = span (x1 , · · · , xs )
It follows that
xs+1 ∈ span (x1 , · · · , xs )
contrary to the assumption the xk are linearly independent. Therefore, r ≤ s as claimed. 
Deﬁnition 2.4.5 A ﬁnite set of vectors, {x1 , · · · , xr } is a basis for Fn if span (x1 , · · · , xr ) =

Corollary 2.4.6 Let {x1 , · · · , xr } and {y1 , · · · , ys } be two bases1 of Fn . Then r = s = n.

MATRICES AND LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

Deﬁnition 2.4.8 A ﬁnite set of vectors, {x1 , · · · , xr } is a basis for a subspace V of Fn if
span (x1 , · · · , xr ) = V and {x1 , · · · , xr } is linearly independent.
Corollary 2.4.9 Let {x1 , · · · , xr } and {y1 , · · · , ys } be two bases for V . Then r = s.
Proof: From the exchange theorem, r ≤ s and s ≤ r. 
Deﬁnition 2.4.10 Let V be a subspace of Fn . Then dim (V ) read as the dimension of V
is the number of vectors in a basis.
Of course you should wonder right now whether an arbitrary subspace even has a basis.
In fact it does and this is in the next theorem. First, here is an interesting lemma.
Lemma 2.4.11 Suppose v ∈
/ span (u1 , · · · , uk ) and {u1 , · · · , uk } is linearly independent.
Then {u1 , · · · , uk , v} is also linearly independent.
∑k
Proof: Suppose
i=1 ci ui + dv = 0. It is required to verify that each ci = 0 and
that d = 0. But if d ̸= 0, then you can solve for v as a linear combination of the vectors,
{u1 , · · · , uk },
k ( )
∑
ci
v=−
ui
d
i=1
∑k
contrary to assumption. Therefore, d = 0. But then i=1 ci ui = 0 and the linear independence of {u1 , · · · , uk } implies each ci = 0 also. 
Theorem 2.4.12 Let V be a nonzero subspace of Fn . Then V has a basis.
Proof: Let v1 ∈ V where v1 ̸= 0. If span {v1 } = V, stop. {v1 } is a basis for V .
Otherwise, there exists v2 ∈ V which is not in span {v1 } . By Lemma 2.4.11 {v1 , v2 } is a
linearly independent set of vectors. If span {v1 , v2 } = V stop, {v1 , v2 } is a basis for V. If
span {v1 , v2 } ̸= V, then there exists v3 ∈
/ span {v1 , v2 } and {v1 , v2 , v3 } is a larger linearly
independent set of vectors. Continuing this way, the process must stop before n + 1 steps
because if not, it would be possible to obtain n + 1 linearly independent vectors contrary to
the exchange theorem. 
In words the following corollary states that any linearly independent set of vectors can
be enlarged to form a basis.
Corollary 2.4.13 Let V be a subspace of Fn and let {v1 , · · · , vr } be a linearly independent
set of vectors in V . Then either it is a basis for V or there exist vectors, vr+1 , · · · , vs such
that {v1 , · · · , vr , vr+1 , · · · , vs } is a basis for V.
Proof: This follows immediately from the proof of Theorem 2.4.12. You do exactly the
same argument except you start with {v1 , · · · , vr } rather than {v1 }. 
It is also true that any spanning set of vectors can be restricted to obtain a basis.
Theorem 2.4.14 Let V be a subspace of Fn and suppose span (u1 · · · , up ) = V where
the ui are nonzero vectors. Then there exist vectors {v1 · · · , vr } such that {v1 · · · , vr } ⊆
{u1 · · · , up } and {v1 · · · , vr } is a basis for V .
Proof: Let r be the smallest positive integer with the property that for some set
{v1 · · · , vr } ⊆ {u1 · · · , up } ,
span (v1 · · · , vr ) = V.
Then r ≤ p and it must be the case that {v1 · · · , vr } is linearly independent because if it
were not so, one of the vectors, say vk would be a linear combination of the others. But
then you could delete this vector from {v1 · · · , vr } and the resulting list of r − 1 vectors
would still span V contrary to the deﬁnition of r. 

An Application To Matrices

The following is a theorem of major signiﬁcance.
Theorem 2.5.1 Suppose A is an n × n matrix. Then A is one to one (injective) if and
only if A is onto (surjective). Also, if B is an n × n matrix and AB = I, then it follows
BA = I.
Proof: First suppose A is one to one. Consider the vectors, {Ae1 , · · · , Aen } where ek
is the column vector which is all zeros except for a 1 in the k th position. This set of vectors
is linearly independent because if
n
∑
ck Aek = 0,
k=1

then since A is linear,

(

)
ck ek

=0

k=1

and since A is one to one, it follows
n
∑

ck ek = 0

k=1

which implies each ck = 0 because the ek are clearly linearly independent.
Therefore, {Ae1 , · · · , Aen } must be a basis for Fn because if not there would exist a
vector, y ∈
/ span (Ae1 , · · · , Aen ) and then by Lemma 2.4.11, {Ae1 , · · · , Aen , y} would be
an independent set of vectors having n + 1 vectors in it, contrary to the exchange theorem.
It follows that for y ∈ Fn there exist constants, ci such that
)
( n
n
∑
∑
ck ek
y=
ck Aek = A
k=1

k=1

showing that, since y was arbitrary, A is onto.
Next suppose A is onto. This means the span of the columns of A equals Fn . If these
columns are not linearly independent, then by Lemma 2.4.3 on Page 57, one of the columns
is a linear combination of the others and so the span of the columns of A equals the span of
the n − 1 other columns. This violates the exchange theorem because {e1 , · · · , en } would be
a linearly independent set of vectors contained in the span of only n − 1 vectors. Therefore,
the columns of A must be independent and this is equivalent to saying that Ax = 0 if and
only if x = 0. This implies A is one to one because if Ax = Ay, then A (x − y) = 0 and so
x − y = 0.
Now suppose AB = I. Why is BA = I? Since AB = I it follows B is one to one since
otherwise, there would exist, x ̸= 0 such that Bx = 0 and then ABx = A0 = 0 ̸= Ix.
Therefore, from what was just shown, B is also onto. In addition to this, A must be one
to one because if Ay = 0, then y = Bx for some x and then x = ABx = Ay = 0 showing
y = 0. Now from what is given to be so, it follows (AB) A = A and so using the associative
law for matrix multiplication,
A (BA) − A = A (BA − I) = 0.
But this means (BA − I) x = 0 for all x since otherwise, A would not be one to one. Hence
BA = I as claimed. 

Matrices And Calculus

The study of moving coordinate systems gives a non trivial example of the usefulness of the
ideas involving linear transformations and matrices. To begin with, here is the concept of
the product rule extended to matrix multiplication.
Deﬁnition 2.6.1 Let A (t) be an m × n matrix. Say A (t) = (Aij( (t)) . Suppose
also that
)
Aij (t) is a diﬀerentiable function for all i, j. Then deﬁne A′ (t) ≡ A′ij (t) . That is, A′ (t)
is the matrix which consists of replacing each entry by its derivative. Such an m × n matrix
in which the entries are diﬀerentiable functions is called a diﬀerentiable matrix.
The next lemma is just a version of the product rule.
Lemma 2.6.2 Let A (t) be an m × n matrix and let B (t) be an n × p matrix with the
property that all the entries of these matrices are diﬀerentiable functions. Then
′

(A (t) B (t)) = A′ (t) B (t) + A (t) B ′ (t) .
Proof: This is like the usual proof.
1
(A (t + h) B (t + h) − A (t) B (t)) =
h
1
1
(A (t + h) B (t + h) − A (t + h) B (t)) + (A (t + h) B (t) − A (t) B (t))
h
h
B (t + h) − B (t) A (t + h) − A (t)
= A (t + h)
+
B (t)

and now, using the fact that the entries of the matrices are all diﬀerentiable, one can pass
to a limit in both sides as h → 0 and conclude that
′

(A (t) B (t)) = A′ (t) B (t) + A (t) B ′ (t) 

The Coriolis Acceleration

Imagine a point on the surface of the earth. Now consider unit vectors, one pointing South,
one pointing East and one pointing directly away from the center of the earth.

k


j
j
i

Denote the ﬁrst as i, the second as j, and the third as k. If you are standing on the earth
you will consider these vectors as ﬁxed, but of course they are not. As the earth turns, they
change direction and so each is in reality a function of t. Nevertheless, it is with respect
to these apparently ﬁxed vectors that you wish to understand acceleration, velocities, and
displacements.
In general, let i∗ , j∗ , k∗ be the usual ﬁxed vectors in space and let i (t) , j (t) , k (t) be an
orthonormal basis of vectors for each t, like the vectors described in the ﬁrst paragraph.
It is assumed these vectors are C 1 functions of t. Letting the positive x axis extend in the
direction of i (t) , the positive y axis extend in the direction of j (t), and the positive z axis
extend in the direction of k (t) , yields a moving coordinate system. Now let u be a vector
and let t0 be some reference time. For example you could let t0 = 0. Then deﬁne the
components of u with respect to these vectors, i, j, k at time t0 as
u ≡ u1 i (t0 ) + u2 j (t0 ) + u3 k (t0 ) .
Let u (t) be deﬁned as the vector which has the same components with respect to i, j, k but
at time t. Thus
u (t) ≡ u1 i (t) + u2 j (t) + u3 k (t) .
and the vector has changed although the components have not.
This is exactly the situation in the case of the apparently ﬁxed basis vectors on the earth
if u is a position vector from the given spot on the earth’s surface to a point regarded as
ﬁxed with the earth due to its keeping the same coordinates relative to the coordinate axes
which are ﬁxed with the earth. Now deﬁne a linear transformation Q (t) mapping R3 to R3
by
Q (t) u ≡ u1 i (t) + u2 j (t) + u3 k (t)
where
u ≡ u1 i (t0 ) + u2 j (t0 ) + u3 k (t0 )

Theorem 2.6.4 Let i (t) , j (t) , k (t) be as described. Then there exists a unique vector Ω (t)
such that if u (t) is a vector whose components are constant with respect to i (t) , j (t) , k (t) ,
then
u′ (t) = Ω (t) × u (t) .
Proof: It only remains to prove uniqueness. Suppose Ω1 also works. Then u (t) = Q (t) u
and so u′ (t) = Q′ (t) u and
Q′ (t) u = Ω × Q (t) u = Ω1 × Q (t) u
for all u. Therefore,
(Ω − Ω1 ) × Q (t) u = 0
for all u and since Q (t) is one to one and onto, this implies (Ω − Ω1 ) ×w = 0 for all w and
thus Ω − Ω1 = 0. 
Now let R (t) be a position vector and let
r (t) = R (t) + rB (t)
where
rB (t) ≡ x (t) i (t) +y (t) j (t) +z (t) k (t) .

r(t)

In the example of the earth, R (t) is the position vector of a point p (t) on the earth’s
surface and rB (t) is the position vector of another point from p (t) , thus regarding p (t)
as the origin. rB (t) is the position vector of a point as perceived by the observer on the
earth with respect to the vectors he thinks of as ﬁxed. Similarly, vB (t) and aB (t) will be
the velocity and acceleration relative to i (t) , j (t) , k (t), and so vB = x′ i + y ′ j + z ′ k and
aB = x′′ i + y ′′ j + z ′′ k. Then
v ≡ r′ = R′ + x′ i + y ′ j + z ′ k+xi′ + yj′ + zk′ .
By , (2.27), if e ∈ {i, j, k} , e′ = Ω × e because the components of these vectors with respect
to i, j, k are constant. Therefore,

and consequently,

Now consider the acceleration. Quantities which are relative to the moving coordinate

The acceleration aB is that perceived by an observer who is moving with the moving coordinate system and for whom the moving coordinate system is ﬁxed. The term Ω× (Ω × rB )
is called the centripetal acceleration. Solving for aB ,
aB = a − R′′ − Ω′ × rB − 2Ω × vB − Ω× (Ω × rB ) .

(2.28)

Here the term − (Ω× (Ω × rB )) is called the centrifugal acceleration, it being an acceleration
felt by the observer relative to the moving coordinate system which he regards as ﬁxed, and
the term −2Ω × vB is called the Coriolis acceleration, an acceleration experienced by the
observer as he moves relative to the moving coordinate system. The mass multiplied by the
Coriolis acceleration deﬁnes the Coriolis force.
There is a ride found in some amusement parks in which the victims stand next to
a circular wall covered with a carpet or some rough material. Then the whole circular
room begins to revolve faster and faster. At some point, the bottom drops out and the
victims are held in place by friction. The force they feel is called centrifugal force and it
causes centrifugal acceleration. It is not necessary to move relative to coordinates ﬁxed with
the revolving wall in order to feel this force and it is pretty predictable. However, if the
nauseated victim moves relative to the rotating wall, he will feel the eﬀects of the Coriolis
force and this force is really strange. The diﬀerence between these forces is that the Coriolis
force is caused by movement relative to the moving coordinate system and the centrifugal
force is not.

2.6.2

The Coriolis Acceleration On The Rotating Earth

Now consider the earth. Let i∗ , j∗ , k∗ , be the usual basis vectors ﬁxed in space with k∗
pointing in the direction of the north pole from the center of the earth and let i, j, k be the
unit vectors described earlier with i pointing South, j pointing East, and k pointing away
from the center of the earth at some point of the rotating earth’s surface p. Letting R (t) be
the position vector of the point p, from the center of the earth, observe the coordinates of
R (t) are constant with respect to i (t) , j (t) , k (t) . Also, since the earth rotates from West
to East and the speed of a point on the surface of the earth relative to an observer ﬁxed in
space is ω |R| sin ϕ where ω is the angular speed of the earth about an axis through the poles
and ϕ is the polar angle measured from the positive z axis down as in spherical coordinates.
It follows from the geometric deﬁnition of the cross product that
R′ = ωk∗ × R

since Ω does not depend on t. Formula (2.28) implies

In this formula, you can totally ignore the term Ω× (Ω × rB ) because it is so small whenever you are considering motion near some point on the earth’s surface. To see this, note

ω (24) (3600) = 2π, and so ω = 7.2722 × 10−5 in radians per second. If you are using

7.2722 × 10−5 |rB | .
Clearly this is not worth considering in the presence of the acceleration due to gravity which
is approximately 32 feet per second squared near the surface of the earth.

directed exactly toward the center of the earth except at the poles and at the equator,
although the components of acceleration which are in other directions are very small when
compared with the acceleration due to the force of gravity and are often neglected. Therefore, if the only force acting on an object is due to gravity, the following formula describes
the acceleration relative to a coordinate system moving with the earth’s surface.
aB = g−2 (Ω × vB )
While the vector Ω is quite small, if the relative velocity, vB is large, the Coriolis acceleration
could be signiﬁcant. This is described in terms of the vectors i (t) , j (t) , k (t) next.
Letting (ρ, θ, ϕ) be the usual spherical coordinates of the point p (t) on the surface

Remember ϕ is ﬁxed and pertains to the ﬁxed point, p (t) on the earth’s surface. Therefore,

Example 2.6.5 Suppose a rock is dropped from a tall building. Where will it strike?
Assume a = −gk and the j component of aB is approximately
−2ω (x′ cos ϕ + z ′ sin ϕ) .
The dominant term in this expression is clearly the second one because x′ will be small.
Also, the i and k contributions will be very small. Therefore, the following equation is
descriptive of the situation.
aB = −gk−2z ′ ω sin ϕj.
z ′ = −gt approximately. Therefore, considering the j component, this is
2gtω sin ϕ.

Two integrations give ωgt3 /3 sin ϕ for the j component of the relative displacement at
time t.
This shows the rock does not fall directly towards the center of the earth as expected
but slightly to the east.

Example 2.6.6 In 1851 Foucault set a pendulum vibrating and observed the earth rotate
out from under it. It was a very long pendulum with a heavy weight at the end so that it
would vibrate for a long time without stopping2 . This is what allowed him to observe the
earth rotate out from under it. Clearly such a pendulum will take 24 hours for the plane of
vibration to appear to make one complete revolution at the north pole. It is also reasonable
to expect that no such observed rotation would take place on the equator. Is it possible to
predict what will take place at various latitudes?
2 There is such a pendulum in the Eyring building at BYU and to keep people from touching it, there is
a little sign which says Warning! 1000 ohms.

Using (2.31), in (2.29),
aB = a − Ω× (Ω × R)
−2ω [(−y ′ cos ϕ) i+ (x′ cos ϕ + z ′ sin ϕ) j − (y ′ sin ϕ) k] .
Neglecting the small term, Ω× (Ω × R) , this becomes
= −gk + T/m−2ω [(−y ′ cos ϕ) i+ (x′ cos ϕ + z ′ sin ϕ) j − (y ′ sin ϕ) k]
where T, the tension in the string of the pendulum, is directed towards the point at which
the pendulum is supported, and m is the mass of the pendulum bob. The pendulum can be
2
thought of as the position vector from (0, 0, l) to the surface of the sphere x2 +y 2 +(z − l) =

If the vibrations of the pendulum are small so that for practical purposes, z ′′ = z = 0, the

All terms of the form xy ′ or y ′ y can be neglected because it is assumed x and y remain
small. Also, the pendulum is assumed to be long with a heavy weight so that x′ and y ′ are
also small. With these simplifying assumptions, the equations of motion become

It is clear from experiments with the pendulum that the earth does indeed rotate out from
under it causing the plane of vibration of the pendulum to appear to rotate. The purpose
of this discussion is not to establish these self evident facts but to predict how long it takes
for the plane of vibration to make one revolution. Therefore, there will be some instant in
time at which the pendulum will be vibrating in a plane determined by k and j. (Recall
k points away from the center of the earth and j points East. ) At this instant in time,
deﬁned as t = 0, the conditions of (2.34) will hold for some value of c and so the solution
to (2.32) having these initial conditions will be those of (2.33) by uniqueness of the initial
value problem. Writing these solutions diﬀerently,

The

√
b2 +4a2
determined by this vector and the vector k. The term sin
t changes relatively fast
2
and takes values between −1 and 1. This is what describes the actual observed vibrations
of the pendulum. Thus the plane of vibration will have made one complete revolution when
t = T for
bT
≡ 2π.

Therefore, the time it takes for the earth to turn out from under the pendulum is
(

I think this is really amazing. You could actually determine latitude, not by taking readings
with instruments using the North Star but by doing an experiment with a big pendulum.
You would set it vibrating, observe T in hours, and then solve the above equation for ϕ.
Also note the pendulum would not appear to change its plane of vibration at the equator
because limϕ→π/2 sec ϕ = ∞.
The Coriolis acceleration is also responsible for the phenomenon of the next example.
Example 2.6.7 It is known that low pressure areas rotate counterclockwise as seen from
above in the Northern hemisphere but clockwise in the Southern hemisphere. Why?
Neglect accelerations other than the Coriolis acceleration and the following acceleration
which comes from an assumption that the point p (t) is the location of the lowest pressure.
a = −a (rB ) rB
where rB = r will denote the distance from the ﬁxed point p (t) on the earth’s surface which
is also the lowest pressure point. Of course the situation could be more complicated but

this will suﬃce to explain the above question. Then the acceleration observed by a person
on the earth relative to the apparently ﬁxed vectors, i, k, j, is
aB = −a (rB ) (xi+yj+zk) − 2ω [−y ′ cos (ϕ) i+ (x′ cos (ϕ) + z ′ sin (ϕ)) j− (y ′ sin (ϕ) k)]
Therefore, one obtains some diﬀerential equations from aB = x′′ i + y ′′ j + z ′′ k by matching
the components. These are
x′′ + a (rB ) x
y ′′ + a (rB ) y
z ′′ + a (rB ) z

= 2ωy ′ cos ϕ
= −2ωx′ cos ϕ − 2ωz ′ sin (ϕ)
= 2ωy ′ sin ϕ

Now remember, the vectors, i, j, k are ﬁxed relative to the earth and so are constant vectors.
Therefore, from the properties of the determinant and the above diﬀerential equations,

(r′B × rB ) =

Then the kth component of this cross product equals
(
)′
ω cos (ϕ) y 2 + x2 + 2ωxz ′ sin (ϕ) .
The ﬁrst term will be negative because it is assumed p (t) is the location of low pressure
causing y 2 +x2 to be a decreasing function. If it is assumed there is not a substantial motion
in the k direction, so that z is fairly constant and the last
( term
( the
) can be neglected, then
)
′
kth component of (r′B × rB ) is negative provided ϕ ∈ 0, π2 and positive if ϕ ∈ π2 , π .
Beginning with a point at rest, this implies r′B × rB = 0 initially and then the above implies
its kth component is negative in the upper hemisphere when ϕ < π/2 and positive in the
lower hemisphere when ϕ > π/2. Using the right hand and the geometric deﬁnition of the
cross product, this shows clockwise rotation in the lower hemisphere and counter clockwise
rotation in the upper hemisphere.
Note also that as ϕ gets close to π/2 near the equator, the above reasoning tends to
break down because cos (ϕ) becomes close to zero. Therefore, the motion towards the low
pressure has to be more pronounced in comparison with the motion in the k direction in
order to draw this conclusion.

Assuming the determinant has been deﬁned for k × k matrices for k ≤ n − 1, it is now
time to deﬁne it for n × n matrices.
Deﬁnition 3.1.3 Let A = (aij ) be an n × n matrix. Then a new matrix called the cofactor
matrix, cof (A) is deﬁned by cof (A) = (cij ) where to obtain cij delete the ith row and the
j th column of A, take the determinant of the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix which results, (This

DETERMINANTS

Note that for a n × n matrix, you will need n! terms to evaluate the determinant in this
way. If n = 10, this is 10! = 3, 628 , 800 terms. This is a lot of terms.
In addition to the diﬃculties just discussed, why is the determinant well deﬁned? Why
should you get the same thing when you expand along any row or column? I think you
should regard this claim that you always get the same answer by picking any row or column
with considerable skepticism. It is incredible and not at all obvious. However, it requires
a little eﬀort to establish it. This is done in the section on the theory of the determinant
which follows.
Notwithstanding the diﬃculties involved in using the method of Laplace expansion,
certain types of matrices are very easy to deal with.
Deﬁnition 3.1.5 A matrix M , is upper triangular if Mij = 0 whenever i > j. Thus such
a matrix equals zero below the main diagonal, the entries of the form Mii , as shown.

A lower triangular matrix is deﬁned similarly as a matrix for which all entries above the
main diagonal are equal to zero.
You should verify the following using the above theorem on Laplace expansion.
Corollary 3.1.6 Let M be an upper (lower) triangular matrix. Then det (M ) is obtained
by taking the product of the entries on the main diagonal.
Proof: The corollary is true if the matrix is one to one. Suppose it is n × n. Then the
matrix is of the form
(
)
m11 a
0
M1
where M1 is (n − 1)×(n − 1) . Then expanding along the ﬁrst row,
∏n you get m11 det (M1 )+0.
Then use the induction hypothesis to obtain that det (M1 ) = i=2 mii . 

Find det (A) .
From the above corollary, this is −6.
There are many properties satisﬁed by determinants. Some of the most important are
listed in the following theorem.
Theorem 3.1.8 If two rows or two columns in an n × n matrix A are switched, the determinant of the resulting matrix equals (−1) times the determinant of the original matrix. If
A is an n × n matrix in which two rows are equal or two columns are equal then det (A) = 0.
Suppose the ith row of A equals (xa1 + yb1 , · · · , xan + ybn ). Then
det (A) = x det (A1 ) + y det (A2 )

where the ith row of A1 is (a1 , · · · , an ) and the ith row of A2 is (b1 , · · · , bn ) , all other rows
of A1 and A2 coinciding with those of A. In other words, det is a linear function of each
row A. The same is true with the word “row” replaced with the word “column”. In addition
to this, if A and B are n × n matrices, then
det (AB) = det (A) det (B) ,
and if A is an n × n matrix, then
( )
det (A) = det AT .
This theorem implies the following corollary which gives a way to ﬁnd determinants. As
I pointed out above, the method of Laplace expansion will not be practical for any matrix
of large size.
Corollary 3.1.9 Let A be an n×n matrix and let B be the matrix obtained by replacing the
ith row (column) of A with the sum of the ith row (column) added to a multiple of another
row (column). Then det (A) = det (B) . If B is the matrix obtained from A be replacing the
ith row (column) of A by a times the ith row (column) then a det (A) = det (B) .
Here is an example which shows how to use this corollary to ﬁnd a determinant.

Replace the second row by (−5) times the ﬁrst row added to it. Then replace the third

You could do more row operations or you could note that this can be easily expanded along
the ﬁrst column followed by expanding the 3 × 3 matrix which results along its ﬁrst column.

The theorem about expanding a matrix along any row or column also provides a way to
give a formula for the inverse of a matrix. Recall the deﬁnition of the inverse of a matrix
in Deﬁnition 2.1.22 on Page 47. The following theorem gives a formula for the inverse of a
matrix. It is proved in the next section.

ij
where
−1
a−1
cof (A)ji
ij = det(A)
for cof (A)ij the ij th cofactor of A.
Theorem 3.1.11 says that to ﬁnd the inverse, take the transpose of the cofactor matrix
and divide by the determinant. The transpose of the cofactor matrix is called the adjugate
or sometimes the classical adjoint of the matrix A. It is an abomination to call it the adjoint
although you do sometimes see it referred to in this way. In words, A−1 is equal to one over
the determinant of A times the adjugate matrix of A.
Example 3.1.12 Find the inverse of the matrix


1 2 3
A= 3 0 1 

First ﬁnd the determinant of this matrix. This is seen to be 12. The cofactor matrix of
A is


−2 −2 6
 4 −2 0  .

Each entry of A was replaced by its cofactor. Therefore, from the above theorem, the inverse
of A should equal

This way of ﬁnding inverses is especially useful in the case where it is desired to ﬁnd the

This formula for the inverse also implies a famous procedure known as Cramer’s rule.
Cramer’s rule gives a formula for the solutions, x, to a system of equations, Ax = y.
In case you are solving a system of equations, Ax = y for x, it follows that if A−1 exists,
(
)
x = A−1 A x = A−1 (Ax) = A−1 y
thus solving the system. Now in the case that A−1 exists, there is a formula for A−1 given
above. Using this formula,

where here the ith column of A is replaced with the column vector, (y1 · · · ·, yn ) , and the
determinant of this modiﬁed matrix is taken and divided by det (A). This formula is known
as Cramer’s rule.
Procedure 3.1.14 Suppose A is an n × n matrix and it is desired to solve the system
T

Ax = y, y = (y1 , · · · , yn ) for x = (x1 , · · · , xn ) . Then Cramer’s rule says

The following theorem is of fundamental importance and ties together many of the ideas
presented above. It is proved in the next section.
Theorem 3.1.15 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then the following are equivalent.
1. A is one to one.
2. A is onto.
3. det (A) ̸= 0.

The Mathematical Theory Of Determinants

It is easiest to give a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the determinant which is clearly well deﬁned
and then prove the earlier one in terms of Laplace expansion. Let (i1 , · · · , in ) be an ordered
list of numbers from {1, · · · , n} . This means the order is important so (1, 2, 3) and (2, 1, 3)
are diﬀerent. There will be some repetition between this section and the earlier section on
determinants. The main purpose is to give all the missing proofs. Two books which give
a good introduction to determinants are Apostol [1] and Rudin [22]. A recent book which
also has a good introduction is Baker [3]

3.3.1

DETERMINANTS

The Function sgn

The following Lemma will be essential in the deﬁnition of the determinant.
Lemma 3.3.1 There exists a unique function, sgnn which maps each ordered list of numbers from {1, · · · , n} to one of the three numbers, 0, 1, or −1 which also has the following
properties.
sgnn (1, · · · , n) = 1
(3.2)
sgnn (i1 , · · · , p, · · · , q, · · · , in ) = − sgnn (i1 , · · · , q, · · · , p, · · · , in )

(3.3)

In words, the second property states that if two of the numbers are switched, the value of the
function is multiplied by −1. Also, in the case where n > 1 and {i1 , · · · , in } = {1, · · · , n} so
that every number from {1, · · · , n} appears in the ordered list, (i1 , · · · , in ) ,
sgnn (i1 , · · · , iθ−1 , n, iθ+1 , · · · , in ) ≡
(−1)

n−θ

sgnn−1 (i1 , · · · , iθ−1 , iθ+1 , · · · , in )

(3.4)

where n = iθ in the ordered list, (i1 , · · · , in ) .
Proof: To begin with, it is necessary to show the existence of such a function. This is
clearly true if n = 1. Deﬁne sgn1 (1) ≡ 1 and observe that it works. No switching is possible.
In the case where n = 2, it is also clearly true. Let sgn2 (1, 2) = 1 and sgn2 (2, 1) = −1
while sgn2 (2, 2) = sgn2 (1, 1) = 0 and verify it works. Assuming such a function exists for n,
sgnn+1 will be deﬁned in terms of sgnn . If there are any repeated numbers in (i1 , · · · , in+1 ) ,
sgnn+1 (i1 , · · · , in+1 ) ≡ 0. If there are no repeats, then n + 1 appears somewhere in the
ordered list. Let θ be the position of the number n + 1 in the list. Thus, the list is of the
form (i1 , · · · , iθ−1 , n + 1, iθ+1 , · · · , in+1 ) . From (3.4) it must be that
sgnn+1 (i1 , · · · , iθ−1 , n + 1, iθ+1 , · · · , in+1 ) ≡
(−1)

n+1−θ

sgnn (i1 , · · · , iθ−1 , iθ+1 , · · · , in+1 ) .

It is necessary to verify this satisﬁes (3.2) and (3.3) with n replaced with n + 1. The ﬁrst of
these is obviously true because
sgnn+1 (1, · · · , n, n + 1) ≡ (−1)

n+1−(n+1)

sgnn (1, · · · , n) = 1.

If there are repeated numbers in (i1 , · · · , in+1 ) , then it is obvious (3.3) holds because both
sides would equal zero from the above deﬁnition. It remains to verify (3.3) in the case where
there are no numbers repeated in (i1 , · · · , in+1 ) . Consider
(
)
r
s
sgnn+1 i1 , · · · , p, · · · , q, · · · , in+1 ,

indicates that the number, q is in the sth position. Suppose ﬁrst that r < θ < s. Then

and so, by induction, a switch of p and q introduces a minus sign in the result. Similarly,
if θ > s or if θ < r it also follows that (3.3) holds. The interesting case is when θ = r or
θ = s. Consider the case where θ = r and note the other case is entirely similar.

This proves the existence of the desired function. Uniqueness follows easily from the following lemma.
Lemma 3.3.2 Every ordered list of {1, 2, · · · , n} can be obtained from every other ordered
list by a ﬁnite number of switches. Also, sgn is unique.
Proof: This is obvious if n = 1 or 2. Suppose then that it is true for sets of n − 1
elements. Take two ordered lists of numbers, P1 , P2 . To get from P1 to P2 using switches,
ﬁrst make a switch to obtain the last element in the list coinciding with the last element of
P2 . By induction, there are switches which will arrange the ﬁrst n − 1 to the right order.
To see sgnn is unique, if there exist two functions, f and g both satisfying (3.2) and
(3.3), you could start with f (1, · · · , n) = g (1, · · · , n) and applying the same sequence of
switches, eventually arrive at f (i1 , · · · , in ) = g (i1 , · · · , in ) . If any numbers are repeated,
then (3.3) gives both functions are equal to zero for that ordered list. 
Deﬁnition 3.3.3 When you have an ordered list of distinct numbers from {1, 2, · · · , n} , say
(i1 , · · · , in ) , this ordered list is called a permutation. The symbol for all such permutations
is Sn . The number sgnn (i1 , · · · , in ) is called the sign of the permutation.

A permutation can also be considered as a function from the set
{1, 2, · · · , n} to {1, 2, · · · , n}
as follows. Let f (k) = ik . Permutations are of fundamental importance in certain areas
of math. For example, it was by considering permutations that Galois was able to give a
criterion for solution of polynomial equations by radicals, but this is a diﬀerent direction
than what is being attempted here.
In what follows sgn will often be used rather than sgnn because the context supplies the
appropriate n.

3.3.2

The Deﬁnition Of The Determinant

Deﬁnition 3.3.4 Let f be a real valued function which has the set of ordered lists of numbers
from {1, · · · , n} as its domain. Deﬁne
∑
f (k1 · · · kn )
(k1 ,··· ,kn )

to be the sum of all the f (k1 · · · kn ) for all possible choices of ordered lists (k1 , · · · , kn ) of
numbers of {1, · · · , n} . For example,
∑
f (k1 , k2 ) = f (1, 2) + f (2, 1) + f (1, 1) + f (2, 2) .
(k1 ,k2 )

Deﬁnition 3.3.5 Let (aij ) = A denote an n × n matrix. The determinant of A, denoted
by det (A) is deﬁned by
∑
sgn (k1 , · · · , kn ) a1k1 · · · ankn
det (A) ≡
(k1 ,··· ,kn )

where the sum is taken over all ordered lists of numbers from {1, · · · , n}. Note it suﬃces to
take the sum over only those ordered lists in which there are no repeats because if there are,
sgn (k1 , · · · , kn ) = 0 and so that term contributes 0 to the sum.
Let A be an n × n matrix A = (aij ) and let (r1 , · · · , rn ) denote an ordered list of n
numbers from {1, · · · , n}. Let A (r1 , · · · , rn ) denote the matrix whose k th row is the rk row
of the matrix A. Thus
∑
det (A (r1 , · · · , rn )) =
sgn (k1 , · · · , kn ) ar1 k1 · · · arn kn
(3.7)
(k1 ,··· ,kn )

and A (1, · · · , n) = A.
Proposition 3.3.6 Let (r1 , · · · , rn ) be an ordered list of numbers from {1, · · · , n}. Then
∑
sgn (r1 , · · · , rn ) det (A) =
sgn (k1 , · · · , kn ) ar1 k1 · · · arn kn

Consequently,
det (A (1, · · · , s, · · · , r, · · · , n)) = − det (A (1, · · · , r, · · · , s, · · · , n)) = − det (A)
Now letting A (1, · · · , s, · · · , r, · · · , n) play the role of A, and continuing in this way, switching pairs of numbers,
p
det (A (r1 , · · · , rn )) = (−1) det (A)
where it took p switches to obtain(r1 , · · · , rn ) from (1, · · · , n). By Lemma 3.3.1, this implies
p

det (A (r1 , · · · , rn )) = (−1) det (A) = sgn (r1 , · · · , rn ) det (A)
and proves the proposition in the case when there are no repeated numbers in the ordered
list, (r1 , · · · , rn ). However, if there is a repeat, say the rth row equals the sth row, then the
reasoning of (3.10) -(3.11) shows that det(A (r1 , · · · , rn )) = 0 and also sgn (r1 , · · · , rn ) = 0
so the formula holds in this case also. 
Observation 3.3.7 There are n! ordered lists of distinct numbers from {1, · · · , n} .
To see this, consider n slots placed in order. There are n choices for the ﬁrst slot. For
each of these choices, there are n − 1 choices for the second. Thus there are n (n − 1) ways
to ﬁll the ﬁrst two slots. Then for each of these ways there are n − 2 choices left for the third
slot. Continuing this way, there are n! ordered lists of distinct numbers from {1, · · · , n} as
stated in the observation.

A Symmetric Deﬁnition

Proof: From Proposition 3.3.6, if the ri are distinct,
∑
det (A) =
sgn (r1 , · · · , rn ) sgn (k1 , · · · , kn ) ar1 k1 · · · arn kn .
(k1 ,··· ,kn )

Summing over all ordered lists, (r1 , · · · , rn ) where the ri are distinct, (If the ri are not
distinct, sgn (r1 , · · · , rn ) = 0 and so there is no contribution to the sum.)
∑

n! det (A) =
sgn (r1 , · · · , rn ) sgn (k1 , · · · , kn ) ar1 k1 · · · arn kn .
(r1 ,··· ,rn ) (k1 ,··· ,kn )

This proves the corollary since the formula gives the same number for A as it does for AT .

Corollary 3.3.9 If two rows or two columns in an n × n matrix A, are switched, the
determinant of the resulting matrix equals (−1) times the determinant of the original matrix.
If A is an n×n matrix in which two rows are equal or two columns are equal then det (A) = 0.
Suppose the ith row of A equals (xa1 + yb1 , · · · , xan + ybn ). Then
det (A) = x det (A1 ) + y det (A2 )
where the ith row of A1 is (a1 , · · · , an ) and the ith row of A2 is (b1 , · · · , bn ) , all other rows
of A1 and A2 coinciding with those of A. In other words, det is a linear function of each
row A. The same is true with the word “row” replaced with the word “column”.
Proof: By Proposition 3.3.6 when two rows are switched, the determinant of the resulting matrix is (−1) times the determinant of the original matrix. By Corollary 3.3.8 the
same holds for columns because the columns of the matrix equal the rows of the transposed
matrix. Thus if A1 is the matrix obtained from A by switching two columns,
( )
( )
det (A) = det AT = − det AT1 = − det (A1 ) .
If A has two equal columns or two equal rows, then switching them results in the same
matrix. Therefore, det (A) = − det (A) and so det (A) = 0.
It remains to verify the last assertion.

Proof: Let A = a1 · · · an be the columns of A and suppose the condition that
one column is a linear combination of r of the others is satisﬁed. Then by using Corollary

Proof: Denote M by (mij ) . Thus in the ﬁrst case, mnn = a and mni = 0 if i ̸= n while
in the second case, mnn = a and min = 0 if i ̸= n. From the deﬁnition of the determinant,
∑
det (M ) ≡
sgnn (k1 , · · · , kn ) m1k1 · · · mnkn
(k1 ,··· ,kn )

Letting θ denote the position of n in the ordered list, (k1 , · · · , kn ) then using the earlier

Now suppose (3.14). Then if kn ̸= n, the term involving mnkn in the above expression
equals zero. Therefore, the only terms which survive are those for which θ = n or in other
words, those for which kn = n. Therefore, the above expression reduces to

In terms of the theory of determinants, arguably the most important idea is that of
Laplace expansion along a row or a column. This will follow from the above deﬁnition of a
determinant.
Deﬁnition 3.3.16 Let A = (aij ) be an n×n matrix. Then a new matrix called the cofactor
matrix cof (A) is deﬁned by cof (A) = (cij ) where to obtain cij delete the ith row and the
j th column of A, take the determinant of the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix which results, (This
i+j
is called the ij th minor of A. ) and then multiply this number by (−1) . To make the
th
formulas easier to remember, cof (A)ij will denote the ij entry of the cofactor matrix.
The following is the main result. Earlier this was given as a deﬁnition and the outrageous
totally unjustiﬁed assertion was made that the same number would be obtained by expanding
the determinant along any row or column. The following theorem proves this assertion.
Theorem 3.3.17 Let A be an n × n matrix where n ≥ 2. Then
det (A) =

aij cof (A)ij =

The ﬁrst formula consists of expanding the determinant along the ith row and the second
expands the determinant along the j th column.
Proof: Let (ai1 , · · · , ain ) be the ith row of A. Let Bj be the matrix obtained from A by
leaving every row the same except the ith row which in Bj equals (0, · · · , 0, aij , 0, · · · , 0) .
Then by Corollary 3.3.9,

Denote by Aij the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix obtained by deleting the ith row and the j th

A Formula For The Inverse

Note that this gives an easy way to write a formula for the inverse of an n ×n matrix. Recall
the deﬁnition of the inverse of a matrix in Deﬁnition 2.1.22 on Page 47.

Now suppose A−1 exists. Then by Theorem 3.3.13,
(
)
(
)
1 = det (I) = det AA−1 = det (A) det A−1
so det (A) ̸= 0. 
The next corollary points out that if an n × n matrix A has a right or a left inverse, then
it has an inverse.
Corollary 3.3.19 Let A be an n × n matrix and suppose there exists an n × n matrix B
such that BA = I. Then A−1 exists and A−1 = B. Also, if there exists C an n × n matrix
such that AC = I, then A−1 exists and A−1 = C.
Proof: Since BA = I, Theorem 3.3.13 implies
det B det A = 1
and so det A ̸= 0. Therefore from Theorem 3.3.18, A−1 exists. Therefore,
(
)
A−1 = (BA) A−1 = B AA−1 = BI = B.
The case where CA = I is handled similarly. 
The conclusion of this corollary is that left inverses, right inverses and inverses are all
the same in the context of n × n matrices.
Theorem 3.3.18 says that to ﬁnd the inverse, take the transpose of the cofactor matrix
and divide by the determinant. The transpose of the cofactor matrix is called the adjugate
or sometimes the classical adjoint of the matrix A. It is an abomination to call it the adjoint
although you do sometimes see it referred to in this way. In words, A−1 is equal to one over
the determinant of A times the adjugate matrix of A.
In case you are solving a system of equations, Ax = y for x, it follows that if A−1 exists,
(
)
x = A−1 A x = A−1 (Ax) = A−1 y
thus solving the system. Now in the case that A−1 exists, there is a formula for A−1 given
above. Using this formula,

3.3.7

Rank Of A Matrix

Deﬁnition 3.3.22 A submatrix of a matrix A is the rectangular array of numbers obtained
by deleting some rows and columns of A. Let A be an m × n matrix. The determinant
rank of the matrix equals r where r is the largest number such that some r × r submatrix
of A has a non zero determinant. The row rank is deﬁned to be the dimension of the span
of the rows. The column rank is deﬁned to be the dimension of the span of the columns.
Theorem 3.3.23 If A, an m × n matrix has determinant rank r, then there exist r rows of
the matrix such that every other row is a linear combination of these r rows.
Proof: Suppose the determinant rank of A = (aij ) equals r. Thus some r × r submatrix
has non zero determinant and there is no larger square submatrix which has non zero
determinant. Suppose such a submatrix is determined by the r columns whose indices are
j1 < · · · < jr
and the r rows whose indices are
i1 < · · · < ir
I want to show that every row is a linear combination of these rows. Consider the lth row
and let p be an index between 1 and n. Form the following (r + 1) × (r + 1) matrix

Of course you can assume l ∈
/ {i1 , · · · , ir } because there is nothing to prove if the lth
row is one of the chosen ones. The above matrix has determinant 0. This is because if
p∈
/ {j1 , · · · , jr } then the above would be a submatrix of A which is too large to have non
zero determinant. On the other hand, if p ∈ {j1 , · · · , jr } then the above matrix has two
columns which are equal so its determinant is still 0.
Expand the determinant of the above matrix along the last column. Let Ck denote the
cofactor associated with the entry aik p . This is not dependent on the choice of p. Remember,
you delete the column and the row the entry is in and take the determinant of what is left
and multiply by −1 raised to an appropriate power. Let C denote the cofactor associated
with alp . This is given to be nonzero, it being the determinant of the matrix

Since this is true for every p and since mk does not depend on p, this has shown the lth row
is a linear combination of the i1 , i2 , · · · , ir rows. 
Corollary 3.3.24 The determinant rank equals the row rank.
Proof: From Theorem 3.3.23, every row is in the span of r rows where r is the determinant rank. Therefore, the row rank (dimension of the span of the rows) is no larger than
the determinant rank. Could the row rank be smaller than the determinant rank? If so,
it follows from Theorem 3.3.23 that there exist p rows for p < r ≡ determinant rank, such
that the span of these p rows equals the row space. But then you could consider the r × r
sub matrix which determines the determinant rank and it would follow that each of these
rows would be in the span of the restrictions of the p rows just mentioned. By Theorem
2.4.4, the exchange theorem, the rows of this sub matrix would not be linearly independent
and so some row is a linear combination of the others. By Corollary 3.3.11 the determinant
would be 0, a contradiction. 
Corollary 3.3.25 If A has determinant rank r, then there exist r columns of the matrix
such that every other column is a linear combination of these r columns. Also the column
rank equals the determinant rank.
Proof: This follows from the above by considering AT . The rows of AT are the columns
of A and the determinant rank of AT and A are the same. Therefore, from Corollary 3.3.24,
column rank of A = row rank of AT = determinant rank of AT = determinant rank of A.
The following theorem is of fundamental importance and ties together many of the ideas
presented above.
Theorem 3.3.26 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then the following are equivalent.
1. det (A) = 0.

2. A, AT are not one to one.
3. A is not onto.

there exist r columns such that every other column is a linear combination of these columns

Since also A0 = 0, it follows A is not one to one. Similarly, AT is not one to one by the
same argument applied to AT . This veriﬁes that 1.) implies 2.).
Now suppose 2.). Then since AT is not one to one, it follows there exists x ̸= 0 such that
AT x = 0.
Taking the transpose of both sides yields
x T A = 0T
where the 0T is a 1 × n matrix or row vector. Now if Ay = x, then

|x| = xT (Ay) = xT A y = 0y = 0
contrary to x ̸= 0. Consequently there can be no y such that Ay = x and so A is not onto.
This shows that 2.) implies 3.).
Finally, suppose 3.). If 1.) does not hold, then det (A) ̸= 0 but then from Theorem 3.3.18
A−1 exists and so for every y ∈ Fn there exists a unique x ∈ Fn such that Ax = y. In fact
x = A−1 y. Thus A would be onto contrary to 3.). This shows 3.) implies 1.). 
Corollary 3.3.27 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then the following are equivalent.
1. det(A) ̸= 0.
2. A and AT are one to one.
3. A is onto.
Proof: This follows immediately from the above theorem.

The Cayley Hamilton Theorem

Deﬁnition 3.4.1 Let A be an n × n matrix. The characteristic polynomial is deﬁned as
pA (t) ≡ det (tI − A)
and the solutions to pA (t) = 0 are called eigenvalues. For A a matrix and p (t) = tn +
an−1 tn−1 + · · · + a1 t + a0 , denote by p (A) the matrix deﬁned by
p (A) ≡ An + an−1 An−1 + · · · + a1 A + a0 I.
The explanation for the last term is that A0 is interpreted as I, the identity matrix.
The Cayley Hamilton theorem states that every matrix satisﬁes its characteristic equation, that equation deﬁned by pA (t) = 0. It is one of the most important theorems in linear
algebra1 . The following lemma will help with its proof.
Lemma 3.4.2 Suppose for all |λ| large enough,
A0 + A1 λ + · · · + Am λm = 0,
where the Ai are n × n matrices. Then each Ai = 0.
Proof: Multiply by λ−m to obtain
A0 λ−m + A1 λ−m+1 + · · · + Am−1 λ−1 + Am = 0.
Now let |λ| → ∞ to obtain Am = 0. With this, multiply by λ to obtain
A0 λ−m+1 + A1 λ−m+2 + · · · + Am−1 = 0.
Now let |λ| → ∞ to obtain Am−1 = 0. Continue multiplying by λ and letting λ → ∞ to
obtain that all the Ai = 0. 
With the lemma, here is a simple corollary.
1 A special case was ﬁrst proved by Hamilton in 1853. The general case was announced by Cayley some
time later and a proof was given by Frobenius in 1878.

Corollary 3.4.3 Let Ai and Bi be n × n matrices and suppose
A0 + A1 λ + · · · + Am λm = B0 + B1 λ + · · · + Bm λm
for all |λ| large enough. Then Ai = Bi for all i. Consequently if λ is replaced by any n × n
matrix, the two sides will be equal. That is, for C any n × n matrix,
A0 + A1 C + · · · + Am C m = B0 + B1 C + · · · + Bm C m .
Proof: Subtract and use the result of the lemma. 
With this preparation, here is a relatively easy proof of the Cayley Hamilton theorem.
Theorem 3.4.4 Let A be an n × n matrix and let p (λ) ≡ det (λI − A) be the characteristic
polynomial. Then p (A) = 0.
Proof: Let C (λ) equal the transpose of the cofactor matrix of (λI − A) for |λ| large.
(If |λ| is large enough, then λ cannot be in the ﬁnite list of eigenvalues of A and so for such
−1
λ, (λI − A) exists.) Therefore, by Theorem 3.3.18
C (λ) = p (λ) (λI − A)

−1

.

Note that each entry in C (λ) is a polynomial in λ having degree no more than n − 1.
Therefore, collecting the terms,
C (λ) = C0 + C1 λ + · · · + Cn−1 λn−1
for Cj some n × n matrix. It follows that for all |λ| large enough,
(
)
(λI − A) C0 + C1 λ + · · · + Cn−1 λn−1 = p (λ) I
and so Corollary 3.4.3 may be used. It follows the matrix coeﬃcients corresponding to equal
powers of λ are equal on both sides of this equation. Therefore, if λ is replaced with A, the
two sides will be equal. Thus
(
)
0 = (A − A) C0 + C1 A + · · · + Cn−1 An−1 = p (A) I = p (A) .

where Aij is a si × pj matrix where si is constant for j = 1, · · · , m for each i = 1, · · · , r.
Such a matrix is called a block matrix, also a partitioned matrix. How do you get the
block Aij ? Here is how for A an m × n matrix:

(3.18)

In the block column matrix on the right, you need to have cj − 1 rows of zeros above the
small pj × pj identity matrix where the columns of A involved in Aij are cj , · · · , cj + pj − 1
and in the block row matrix on the left, you need to have ri − 1 columns of zeros to the left
of the si × si identity matrix where the rows of A involved in Aij are ri , · · · , ri + si . An
important observation to make is that the matrix on the right speciﬁes columns to use in
the block and the one on the left speciﬁes the rows used. Thus the block Aij in this case
is a matrix of size si × pj . There is no overlap between the blocks of A. Thus the identity
n × n identity matrix corresponding to multiplication on the right of A is of the form


where these little identity matrices don’t overlap. A similar conclusion follows from consideration of the matrices Isi ×si . Note that in (3.18) the matrix on the right is a block column
matrix for the above block diagonal matrix and the matrix on the left in (3.18) is a block
row matrix taken from a similar block diagonal matrix consisting of the Isi ×si .
Next consider the question of multiplication of two block matrices. Let B be a block
matrix of the form

and that for all i, j, it makes sense to multiply Bis Asj for all s ∈ {1, · · · , p}. (That is the
two matrices, Bis and Asj are conformable.) and that
∑ for ﬁxed ij, it follows Bis Asj is the
same size for each s so that it makes sense to write s Bis Asj .
The following theorem says essentially that when you take the product of two matrices,
you can do it two ways. One way is to simply multiply them forming BA. The other way
is to partition both matrices, formally multiply the blocks to get another block matrix and
this one will be BA partitioned. Before presenting this theorem, here is a simple lemma
which is really a special case of the theorem.

where the ﬁrst is n × r and the second is r × n. The small identity matrix I is an r × r matrix

Theorem 3.5.2 Let B be a q × p block matrix as in (3.19) and let A be a p × n block matrix
as in (3.20) such that Bis is conformable with Asj and each product, Bis Asj for s = 1, · · · , p
is of the same size so they can be added. Then BA can be obtained as a block matrix such

Row Operations
4.1

Elementary Matrices

The elementary matrices result from doing a row operation to the identity matrix.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1 The row operations consist of the following
1. Switch two rows.
2. Multiply a row by a nonzero number.
3. Replace a row by a multiple of another row added to it.
The elementary matrices are given in the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.1.2 The elementary matrices consist of those matrices which result by applying a row operation to an identity matrix. Those which involve switching rows of the identity
are called permutation matrices. More generally, if (i1 , i2 , · · · , in ) is a permutation, a matrix which has a 1 in the ik position in row k and zero in every other position of that row is
called a permutation matrix. Thus each permutation corresponds to a unique permutation
matrix.
As an example of why these elementary matrices are interesting, consider the following.

This has established the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1.3 Let P ij denote the elementary matrix which involves switching the ith and
the j th rows. Then
P ij A = B
where B is obtained from A by switching the ith and the j th rows.
As a consequence of the above lemma, if you have any permutation (i1 , · · · , in ), it
follows from Lemma 3.3.2 that the corresponding permutation matrix can be obtained by
multiplying ﬁnitely many permutation matrices, each of which switch only two rows. Now
every such permutation matrix in which only two rows are switched has determinant −1.
p
Therefore, the determinant of the permutation matrix for (i1 , · · · , in ) equals (−1) where
the given permutation can be obtained by making p switches. Now p is not unique. There
are many ways to make switches and end up with a given permutation, but what this shows
is that the total number of switches is either always odd or always even. That is, you could
not obtain a given permutation by making 2m switches and 2k + 1 switches. A permutation
is said to be even if p is even and odd if p is odd. This is an interesting result in abstract
algebra which is obtained very easily from a consideration of elementary matrices and of
course the theory of the determinant. Also, this shows that the composition of permutations
corresponds to the product of the corresponding permutation matrices.
To see permutations considered more directly in the context of group theory, you should
see a good abstract algebra book such as [17] or [13].
Next consider the row operation which involves multiplying the ith row by a nonzero
constant, c. The elementary matrix which results from applying this operation to the ith
row of the identity matrix is of the form

The case where i > j is handled similarly. This proves the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1.5 Let E (c × i + j) denote the elementary matrix obtained from I by replacing
the j th row with c times the ith row added to it. Then
E (c × i + j) A = B
where B is obtained from A by replacing the j th row of A with itself added to c times the
ith row of A.

ROW OPERATIONS

The next theorem is the main result.
Theorem 4.1.6 To perform any of the three row operations on a matrix A it suﬃces to do
the row operation on the identity matrix obtaining an elementary matrix E and then take
the product, EA. Furthermore, each elementary matrix is invertible and its inverse is an
elementary matrix.
Proof: The ﬁrst part of this theorem has been proved in Lemmas 4.1.3 - 4.1.5. It
only remains to verify the claim about the inverses. Consider ﬁrst the elementary matrices
corresponding to row operation of type three.
E (−c × i + j) E (c × i + j) = I
This follows because the ﬁrst matrix takes c times row i in the identity and adds it to row j.
When multiplied on the left by E (−c × i + j) it follows from the ﬁrst part of this theorem
that you take the ith row of E (c × i + j) which coincides with the ith row of I since that
row was not changed, multiply it by −c and add to the j th row of E (c × i + j) which was
the j th row of I added to c times the ith row of I. Thus E (−c × i + j) multiplied on the
left, undoes the row operation which resulted in E (c × i + j). The same argument applied
to the product
E (c × i + j) E (−c × i + j)
replacing c with −c in the argument yields that this product is also equal to I. Therefore,
−1
E (c × i + j) = E (−c × i + j) .
Similar reasoning shows that for E (c, i) the elementary matrix which comes from multiplying the ith row by the nonzero constant, c,
(
)
−1
E (c, i) = E c−1 , i .
Finally, consider P ij which involves switching the ith and the j th rows.
P ij P ij = I
because by the ﬁrst part of this theorem, multiplying on the left by P ij switches the ith
and j th rows of P ij which was obtained from switching the ith and j th rows of the identity.
First you switch them to get P ij and then you multiply on the left by P ij which switches
( )−1
these rows again and restores the identity matrix. Thus P ij
= P ij . 

4.2

The Rank Of A Matrix

Recall the following deﬁnition of rank of a matrix.
Deﬁnition 4.2.1 A submatrix of a matrix A is the rectangular array of numbers obtained
by deleting some rows and columns of A. Let A be an m × n matrix. The determinant
rank of the matrix equals r where r is the largest number such that some r × r submatrix
of A has a non zero determinant. The row rank is deﬁned to be the dimension of the span
of the rows. The column rank is deﬁned to be the dimension of the span of the columns.
The rank of A is denoted as rank (A).
The following theorem is proved in the section on the theory of the determinant and is
restated here for convenience.
Theorem 4.2.2 Let A be an m × n matrix. Then the row rank, column rank and determinant rank are all the same.

4.2. THE RANK OF A MATRIX

111

So how do you ﬁnd the rank? It turns out that row operations are the key to the practical
computation of the rank of a matrix.
In rough terms, the following lemma states that linear relationships between columns
in a matrix are preserved by row operations.
Lemma 4.2.3 Let B and A be two m × n matrices and suppose B results from a row
operation applied to A. Then the k th column of B is a linear combination of the i1 , · · · , ir
columns of B if and only if the k th column of A is a linear combination of the i1 , · · · , ir
columns of A. Furthermore, the scalars in the linear combination are the same. (The linear
relationship between the k th column of A and the i1 , · · · , ir columns of A is the same as the
linear relationship between the k th column of B and the i1 , · · · , ir columns of B.)
Proof: Let A equal the following matrix in which the ak are the columns
(
)
a1 a2 · · · an
and let B equal the following matrix in which the columns are given by the bk
(
)
b1 b2 · · · bn
Then by Theorem 4.1.6 on Page 110 bk = Eak where E is an elementary matrix. Suppose
then that one of the columns of A is a linear combination of some other columns of A. Say
∑
ak =
cr ar .
r∈S

Then multiplying by E,
bk = Eak =

∑

cr Ear =

r∈S

∑

cr br .

r∈S

Corollary 4.2.4 Let A and B be two m × n matrices such that B is obtained by applying
a row operation to A. Then the two matrices have the same rank.
Proof: Lemma 4.2.3 says the linear relationships are the same between the columns of
A and those of B. Therefore, the column rank of the two matrices is the same. 
This suggests that to ﬁnd the rank of a matrix, one should do row operations until a
matrix is obtained in which its rank is obvious.
Example 4.2.5 Find the rank of the following matrix and identify columns whose linear
combinations yield all the other columns.


1 2 1 3 2
 1 3 6 0 2 
(4.1)
3 7 8 6 6
Take (−1) times the ﬁrst row and add
row and add to the third. This yields

 0 1
0 1

to the second and then take (−3) times the ﬁrst
1
5


3 2
−3 0 
−3 0

By the above corollary, this matrix has the same rank as the ﬁrst matrix. Now take (−1)
times the second row and add to the third row yielding


1 2 1 3 2

ROW OPERATIONS

At this point it is clear the rank is 2. This is because every column is in the span of the
ﬁrst two and these ﬁrst two columns are linearly independent.
Example 4.2.6 Find the rank of the following matrix and identify columns whose linear
combinations yield all the other columns.


1 2 1 3 2

(4.3)

It is now clear the rank of this matrix is 2 because the ﬁrst and third columns form a
basis for the column space.
The matrix (4.3) is the row reduced echelon form for the matrix (4.2).

4.3

The Row Reduced Echelon Form

The following deﬁnition is for the row reduced echelon form of a matrix.
Deﬁnition 4.3.1 Let ei denote the column vector which has all zero entries except for the
ith slot which is one. An m×n matrix is said to be in row reduced echelon form if, in viewing
successive columns from left to right, the ﬁrst nonzero column encountered is e1 and if you
have encountered e1 , e2 , · · · , ek , the next column is either ek+1 or is a linear combination
of the vectors, e1 , e2 , · · · , ek .
For example, here are some


Theorem 4.3.2 Let A be an m × n matrix. Then A has a row reduced echelon form
determined by a simple process.

4.3. THE ROW REDUCED ECHELON FORM

113

Proof: Viewing the columns of A from left to right take the ﬁrst nonzero column. Pick
a nonzero entry in this column and switch the row containing this entry with the top row of
A. Now divide this new top row by the value of this nonzero entry to get a 1 in this position
and then use row operations to make all entries below this entry equal to zero. Thus the
ﬁrst nonzero column is now e1 . Denote the resulting matrix by A1 . Consider the submatrix
of A1 to the right of this column and below the ﬁrst row. Do exactly the same thing for it
that was done for A. This time the e1 will refer to Fm−1 . Use this 1 and row operations
to zero out every entry above it in the rows of A1 . Call the resulting matrix A2 . Thus A2
satisﬁes the conditions of the above deﬁnition up to the column just encountered. Continue
this way till every column has been dealt with and the result must be in row reduced echelon
form. 
The following diagram illustrates the above procedure. Say the matrix looked something
like the following.


0 ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗
 0 ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ 


 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 

and if the ﬁrst column consists of all zeros but the
something like this.

0 1 ∗ ∗
 .. .. .. ..
 . . . .
0 0 ∗ ∗

∗
next one is not all zeros, you would get

∗
.. 
. 
∗

Thus, after zeroing out the term in the top row above the 1, you get the following for the
next step in the computation of the row reduced echelon form for the original matrix.


0 1 ∗ 0 ∗ ∗ ∗

Next you look at the lower right matrix below the top two rows and to the right of the ﬁrst
four columns and repeat the process.
Deﬁnition 4.3.3 The ﬁrst pivot column of A is the ﬁrst nonzero column of A. The next
pivot column is the ﬁrst column after this which is not a linear combination of the columns to
its left. The third pivot column is the next column after this which is not a linear combination

of those columns to its left, and so forth. Thus by Lemma 4.2.3 if a pivot column occurs
as the j th column from the left, it follows that in the row reduced echelon form there will be
one of the ek as the j th column.
There are three choices for row operations at each step in the above theorem. A natural
question is whether the same row reduced echelon matrix always results in the end from
following the above algorithm applied in any way. The next corollary says this is the case.
Deﬁnition 4.3.4 Two matrices are said to be row equivalent if one can be obtained from
the other by a sequence of row operations.
Since every row operation can be obtained by multiplication on the left by an elementary
matrix and since each of these elementary matrices has an inverse which is also an elementary
matrix, it follows that row equivalence is a similarity relation. Thus one can classify matrices
according to which similarity class they are in. Later in the book, another more profound
way of classifying matrices will be presented.
It has been shown above that every matrix is row equivalent to one which is in row
reduced echelon form. Note


x1
 .. 
 .  = x1 e1 + · · · + xn en
xn
so to say two column vectors are equal is to say they are the same linear combination of the
special vectors ej .
Corollary 4.3.5 The row reduced echelon form is unique. That is if B, C are two matrices
in row reduced echelon form and both are row equivalent to A, then B = C.
Proof: Suppose B and C are both row reduced echelon forms for the matrix A. Then
they clearly have the same zero columns since row operations leave zero columns unchanged.
If B has the sequence e1 , e2 , · · · , er occurring for the ﬁrst time in the positions, i1 , i2 , · · · , ir ,
the description of the row reduced echelon form means that each of these columns is not a
linear combination of the preceding columns. Therefore, by Lemma 4.2.3, the same is true of
the columns in positions i1 , i2 , · · · , ir for C. It follows from the description of the row reduced
echelon form, that e1 , · · · , er occur respectively for the ﬁrst time in columns i1 , i2 , · · · , ir
for C. Thus B, C have the same columns in these positions. By Lemma 4.2.3, the other
columns in the two matrices are linear combinations, involving the same scalars, of the
columns in the i1 , · · · , ik position. Thus each column of B is identical to the corresponding
column in C. 
The above corollary shows that you can determine whether two matrices are row equivalent by simply checking their row reduced echelon forms. The matrices are row equivalent
if and only if they have the same row reduced echelon form.
The following corollary follows.
Corollary 4.3.6 Let A be an m × n matrix and let R denote the row reduced echelon form
obtained from A by row operations. Then there exists a sequence of elementary matrices,
E1 , · · · , Ep such that
(Ep Ep−1 · · · E1 ) A = R.
Proof: This follows from the fact that row operations are equivalent to multiplication
on the left by an elementary matrix. 

4.3. THE ROW REDUCED ECHELON FORM

115

Corollary 4.3.7 Let A be an invertible n × n matrix. Then A equals a ﬁnite product of
elementary matrices.
Proof: Since A−1 is given to exist, it follows A must have rank n because by Theorem
3.3.18 det(A) ̸= 0 which says the determinant rank and hence the column rank of A is n
and so the row reduced echelon form of A is I because the columns of A form a linearly
independent set. Therefore, by Corollary 4.3.6 there is a sequence of elementary matrices,
E1 , · · · , Ep such that
(Ep Ep−1 · · · E1 ) A = I.
−1
−1
But now multiply on the left on both sides by Ep−1 then by Ep−1
and then by Ep−2
etc.
until you get
−1
A = E1−1 E2−1 · · · Ep−1
Ep−1

and by Theorem 4.1.6 each of these in this product is an elementary matrix.
Corollary 4.3.8 The rank of a matrix equals the number of nonzero pivot columns. Furthermore, every column is contained in the span of the pivot columns.
Proof: Write the row reduced echelon form for the matrix. From Corollary 4.2.4 this
row reduced matrix has the same rank as the original matrix. Deleting all the zero rows
and all the columns in the row reduced echelon form which do not correspond to a pivot
column, yields an r × r identity submatrix in which r is the number of pivot columns. Thus
the rank is at least r.
From Lemma 4.2.3 every column of A is a linear combination of the pivot columns since
this is true by deﬁnition for the row reduced echelon form. Therefore, the rank is no more
than r. 
Here is a fundamental observation related to the above.
Corollary 4.3.9 Suppose A is an m×n matrix and that m < n. That is, the number of rows
is less than the number of columns. Then one of the columns of A is a linear combination
of the preceding columns of A.
Proof: Since m < n, not all the columns of A can be pivot columns. That is, in the
row reduced echelon form say ei occurs for the ﬁrst time at ri where r1 < r2 < · · · < rp
where p ≤ m. It follows since m < n, there exists some column in the row reduced echelon
form which is a linear combination of the preceding columns. By Lemma 4.2.3 the same is
true of the columns of A. 
Deﬁnition 4.3.10 Let A be an m×n matrix having rank, r. Then the nullity of A is deﬁned
to be n − r. Also deﬁne ker (A) ≡ {x ∈ Fn : Ax = 0} . This is also denoted as N (A) .
Observation 4.3.11 Note that ker (A) is a subspace because if a, b are scalars and x, y are
vectors in ker (A), then
A (ax + by) = aAx + bAy = 0 + 0 = 0
Recall that the dimension of the column space of a matrix equals its rank and since the
column space is just A (Fn ) , the rank is just the dimension of A (Fn ). The next theorem
shows that the nullity equals the dimension of ker (A).
Theorem 4.3.12 Let A be an m × n matrix. Then rank (A) + dim (ker (A)) = n..

ROW OPERATIONS

Proof: Since ker (A) is a subspace, there exists a basis for ker (A) , {x1 , · · · , xk } . Also
let {Ay1 , · · · , Ayl } be a basis for A (Fn ). Let u ∈ Fn . Then there exist unique scalars ci
such that

It follows that

and so the vector in parenthesis is in ker (A). Thus there exist unique bj such that

Since u was arbitrary, this shows {x1 , · · · , xk , y1 , · · · , yl } spans Fn . If these vectors are

then that
l

Apply A to both sides. This yields

Rank And Existence Of Solutions To Linear Systems

Consider the linear system of equations,
Ax = b

(4.4)

where A is an m × n matrix, x is a n × 1 column vector, and b is an m × 1 column vector.
Suppose
(
)
A = a1 · · · an
T

where the ak denote the columns of A. Then x = (x1 , · · · , xn ) is a solution of the system
(4.4), if and only if
x1 a1 + · · · + xn an = b
which says that b is a vector in span (a1 , · · · , an ) . This shows that there exists a solution
to the system, (4.4) if and only if b is contained in span (a1 , · · · , an ) . In words, there is a
solution to (4.4) if and only if b is in the column space of A. In terms of rank, the following
proposition describes the situation.
Proposition 4.4.1 Let A be an m × n matrix and let b be an m × 1 column vector. Then
there exists a solution to (4.4) if and only if
(
)
rank A | b = rank (A) .

4.5. FREDHOLM ALTERNATIVE

117

(
)
Proof: Place A | b and A in row reduced echelon form, respectively B and C. If
the above condition on rank is true, then both B and C have the same number of nonzero
rows. In particular, you cannot have a row of the form
(
)
0 ··· 0 ⋆
where ⋆ ̸= 0 in B. Therefore, there will exist a solution to the system (4.4).
Conversely, suppose there exists a solution. This means there cannot be such a row in B
described above. Therefore, B and C must have the same number of zero rows and so they
have the same number of nonzero rows. Therefore, the rank of the two matrices in (4.5) is
the same. 

4.5

Fredholm Alternative

There is a very useful version of Proposition 4.4.1 known as the Fredholm alternative.
I will only present this for the case of real matrices here. Later a much more elegant and
general approach is presented which allows for the general case of complex matrices.
The following deﬁnition is used to state the Fredholm alternative.
Deﬁnition 4.5.1 Let S ⊆ Rm . Then S ⊥ ≡ {z ∈ Rm : z · s = 0 for every s ∈ S} . The funny
exponent, ⊥ is called “perp”.
Now note

Lemma 4.5.2 Let A be a real m × n matrix, let x ∈ Rn and y ∈ Rm . Then
(

(Ax · y) = x·AT y
Proof: This follows right away from the deﬁnition of the inner product and matrix
multiplication.
∑
∑( )
(
)
(Ax · y) =
Akl xl yk =
AT lk xl yk = x · AT y . 
k,l

k,l

Now it is time to state the Fredholm alternative. The ﬁrst version of this is the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.5.3 Let A be a real m × n matrix and let b ∈ Rm . There exists a solution, x
( )⊥
to the equation Ax = b if and only if b ∈ ker AT .
( )⊥
Proof: First suppose b ∈ ker AT . Then this says that if AT x = 0, it follows that
b · x = 0. In other words, taking the transpose, if
xT A = 0, then xT b = 0.
Thus, if P is a product of elementary matrices such that P A is in row reduced echelon form,
th
th
then if P A has a row
( of zeros, in
) the k position, then there is also a zero in the k position
A
|
b
of P b. Thus rank
= rank (A) .By Proposition 4.4.1, there exists a solution, x
to the system Ax
( T=) b. It remains to go the other direction.
Let z ∈ ker A and suppose Ax = b. I need to verify b · z = 0. By Lemma 4.5.2,
b · z = Ax · z = x · AT z = x · 0 = 0 
This implies the following corollary which is also called the Fredholm alternative. The
“alternative” becomes more clear in this corollary.

ROW OPERATIONS

Corollary 4.5.4 Let A be an m × n matrix. Then A maps Rn onto Rm if and only if the
only solution to AT x = 0 is x = 0.
( )
( )⊥
Proof: If the only solution to AT x = 0 is x = 0, then ker AT = {0} and so ker AT
=
Rm because every b ∈ Rm has the property that b · 0 = 0. Therefore, Ax = b has a solu( )⊥
tion for any b ∈ Rm because the b for which there is a solution are those in ker AT
by
Theorem 4.5.3. In other words, A maps Rn onto Rm .
( )⊥
Conversely if A is onto, then by Theorem 4.5.3 every b ∈ Rm is in ker AT
and so if
AT x = 0, then b · x = 0 for every b. In particular, this holds for b = x. Hence if AT x = 0,
then x = 0. 
Here is an amusing example.
Example 4.5.5 Let A be an m × n matrix in which m > n. Then A cannot map onto Rm .
The reason for this is that AT is an n × m where m > n and so in the augmented matrix
( T )
A |0
there must be some free variables. Thus there exists a nonzero vector x such that AT x = 0.

Some Factorizations
5.1

LU Factorization

An LU factorization of a matrix involves writing the given matrix as the product of a
lower triangular matrix which has the main diagonal consisting entirely of ones, L, and an
upper triangular matrix U in the indicated order. The L goes with “lower” and the U with
“upper”. It turns out many matrices can be written in this way and when this is possible,
people get excited about slick ways of solving the system of equations, Ax = y. The method
lacks generality but is of interest just the same.

Therefore, b = 1 and a = 0. Also, from the bottom rows, xa = 1 which can’t happen and
have a = 0. Therefore, you can’t write this matrix in the form LU. It has no LU factorization.
This is what I mean above by saying the method lacks generality.
Which matrices have an LU factorization? It turns out it is those whose row reduced
echelon form can be achieved without switching rows and which only involve row operations
of type 3 in which row j is replaced with a multiple of row i added to row j for i < j.

Finding An LU Factorization

There is a convenient procedure for ﬁnding an LU factorization. It turns out that it is
only necessary to keep track of the multipliers which are used to row reduce to upper
triangular form. This procedure is described in the following examples and is called the
multiplier method. It is due to Dolittle.

Note the method for updating the matrix on the left. The 2 in the second entry of the ﬁrst
column is there because −2 times the ﬁrst row of A added to the second row of A produced
a 0. Now replace the third row in the matrix on the right by −1 times the ﬁrst row added
to the third. Thus the next step is

This time everything is done at once for a whole column. This saves trouble. First
multiply the ﬁrst row by (−1) and then add to the last row. Next take (−2) times the ﬁrst

This process is entirely typical of the general case. The matrix U is just the ﬁrst upper
triangular matrix you come to in your quest for the row reduced echelon form using only

the row operation which involves replacing a row by itself added to a multiple of another
row. The matrix L is what you get by updating the identity matrix as illustrated above.
You should note that for a square matrix, the number of row operations necessary to
reduce to LU form is about half the number needed to place the matrix in row reduced
echelon form. This is why an LU factorization is of interest in solving systems of equations.

5.3

Solving Linear Systems Using An LU Factorization

The reason people care about the LU factorization is it allows the quick solution of systems
of equations. Here is an example.





 

 2 .

Of course one way is to write the augmented matrix and grind away. However, this
involves more row operations than the computation of an LU factorization and it turns out
that an LU factorization can give the solution quickly. Here is how. The following is an LU
factorization for the matrix.

It may seem like a trivial thing but it is used because it cuts down on the number of

diﬀerence for large systems.

SOME FACTORIZATIONS

The P LU Factorization

As indicated above, some matrices don’t have an LU factorization. Here is an example.


1 2 3 2
M = 1 2 3 0 
(5.1)
4 3 1 1
In this case, there is another factorization which is useful called a P LU factorization. Here
P is a permutation matrix.
Example 5.4.1 Find a P LU factorization for the above matrix in (5.1).
Proceed as before trying to ﬁnd the row echelon form of the matrix. First add −1 times
the ﬁrst row to the second row and then add −4 times the ﬁrst to the third. This yields



1 0 0
1 2
3
2
 1 1 0  0 0
0
−2 
4 0 1
0 −5 −11 −7
There is no way to do only row operations involving replacing a row with itself added to a
multiple of another row to the second matrix in such a way as to obtain an upper triangular
matrix. Therefore, consider M with the bottom two rows switched.


1 2 3 2
M′ =  4 3 1 1  .
1 2 3 0
Now try again with this matrix. First take −1 times the ﬁrst row and add to the bottom
row and then take −4 times the ﬁrst row and add to the second row. This yields



1 2
3

1 0 0
 4 1 0   0 −5 −11 −7 

The second matrix is upper triangular and so


1 0 0

 4 1 0  0

Thus M ′ = P M = LU where L and U

Justiﬁcation For The Multiplier Method

Why does the multiplier method work for ﬁnding an LU factorization? Suppose A is a
matrix which has the property that the row reduced echelon form for A may be achieved
using only the row operations which involve replacing a row with itself added to a multiple
of another row. It is not ever necessary to switch rows. Thus every row which is replaced
using this row operation in obtaining the echelon form may be modiﬁed by using a row
which is above it. Furthermore, in the multiplier method for ﬁnding the LU factorization,
we zero out the elements below the pivot entry in ﬁrst column and then the next and so on
when scanning from the left. In terms of elementary matrices, this means the row operations
used to reduce A to upper triangular form correspond to multiplication on the left by lower
triangular matrices having all ones down the main diagonal and the sequence of elementary
matrices which row reduces A has the property that in scanning the list of elementary
matrices from the right to the left, this list consists of several matrices which involve only
changes from the identity in the ﬁrst column, then several which involve only changes from
the identity in the second column and so forth. More precisely, Ep · · · E1 A = U where U
is upper triangular, each Ei is a lower triangular elementary matrix having all ones down
the main diagonal, for some ri , each of Er1 · · · E1 diﬀers from the identity only in the ﬁrst
column, each of Er2 · · · Er1 +1 diﬀers from the identity only in the second column and so

forth. Therefore, A = E1−1 · · · Ep−1
Now each of the Ei−1 is also lower triangular with 1 down the main diagonal. Therefore
their product has this property. Recall also that if Ei equals the identity matrix except

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/

128

SOME FACTORIZATIONS

for having an a in the j th column somewhere below the main diagonal, Ei−1 is obtained by
replacing the a in Ei with −a, thus explaining why we replace with −1 times the multiplier
−1
in computing L. In the case where A is a 3 × m matrix, E1−1 · · · Ep−1
Ep−1 is of the form



 

1 0 0
1 0 0

0 0 1
b 0 1
0 c 1
b c 1
Note that scanning from left to right, the ﬁrst two in the product involve changes in the
identity only in the ﬁrst column while in the third matrix, the change is only in the second.
If the entries in the ﬁrst column had been zeroed out in a diﬀerent order, the following
would have resulted.



 

1 0 0
1 0 0

b 0 1
0 0 1
0 c 1
b c 1
However, it is important to be working from the left to the right, one column at a time.
A similar observation holds in any dimension. Multiplying the elementary matrices which
involve a change only in the j th column you obtain A equal to an upper triangular, n × m
matrix U which is multiplied by a sequence of lower triangular matrices on its left which is
of the following form, in which the aij are negatives of multipliers used in row reducing to
an upper triangular matrix.

Notice how the end result of the matrix multiplication made no change in the aij . It just
ﬁlled in the empty spaces with the aij which occurred in one of the matrices in the product.
This is why, in computing L, it is suﬃcient to begin with the left column and work column
by column toward the right, replacing entries with the negative of the multiplier used in the
row operation which produces a zero in that entry.

5.6

Existence For The P LU Factorization

Here I will consider an invertible n × n matrix and show that such a matrix always has
a P LU factorization. More general matrices could also be considered but this is all I will
present.
Let A be such an invertible matrix and consider the ﬁrst column of A. If A11 ̸= 0, use
this to zero out everything below it. The entry A11 is called the pivot. Thus in this case
there is a lower triangular matrix L1 which has all ones on the diagonal such that

5.6. EXISTENCE FOR THE P LU FACTORIZATION

129

Here P1 = I. In case A11 = 0, let r be such that Ar1 ̸= 0 and r is the ﬁrst entry for which
this happens. In this case, let P1 be the permutation matrix which switches the ﬁrst row
and the rth row. Then as before, there exists a lower triangular matrix L1 which has all
ones on the diagonal such that (5.2) holds in this case also. In the ﬁrst column, this L1 has
zeros between the ﬁrst row and the rth row.
Go to A1 . Following the same procedure as above, there exists a lower triangular matrix
and permutation matrix L′2 , P2′ such that

0 0 A2
and L2 has all the subdiagonal entries equal to 0 except possibly some nonzero entries in
the second column starting with position r2 where P2 switches rows r2 and 2. Continuing
this way, it follows there are lower triangular matrices Lj having all ones down the diagonal
and permutation matrices Pi which switch only two rows such that
Ln−1 Pn−1 Ln−2 Pn−2 Ln−3 · · · L2 P2 L1 P1 A = U

(5.3)

where U is upper triangular. The matrix Lj has all zeros below the main diagonal except
for the j th column and even in this column it has zeros between position j and rj where Pj
switches rows j and rj . Of course in the case where no switching is necessary, you could get
all nonzero entries below the main diagonal in the j th column for Lj .
The fact that Lj is the identity except for the j th column means that each Pk for k > j
almost commutes with Lj . Say Pk switches the k th and the q th rows for q ≥ k > j. When
you place Pk on the right of Lj it just switches the k th and the q th columns and leaves the
j th column unchanged. Therefore, the same result as placing Pk on the left of Lj can be
obtained by placing Pk on the right of Lj and modifying Lj by switching the k th and the q th
entries in the j th column. (Note this could possibly interchange a 0 for something nonzero.)
It follows from (5.3) there exists P, the product of permutation matrices, P = Pn−1 · · · P1
each of which switches two rows, and L a lower triangular matrix having all ones on the
main diagonal, L = L′n−1 · · · L′2 L′1 , where the L′j are obtained as just described by moving a
succession of Pk from the left to the right of Lj and modifying the j th column as indicated,
such that
LP A = U.
Then

A = P T L−1 U

SOME FACTORIZATIONS

It is customary to write this more simply as
A = P LU
where L is an upper triangular matrix having all ones on the diagonal and P is a permutation
matrix consisting of P1 · · · Pn−1 as described above. This proves the following theorem.
Theorem 5.6.1 Let A be any invertible n × n matrix. Then there exists a permutation
matrix P and a lower triangular matrix L having all ones on the main diagonal and an
upper triangular matrix U such that
A = P LU

5.7

The QR Factorization

As pointed out above, the LU factorization is not a mathematically respectable thing because it does not always exist. There is another factorization which does always exist.
Much more can be said about it than I will say here. At this time, I will only deal with real
matrices and so the inner product will be the usual real dot product.
Deﬁnition 5.7.1 An n × n real matrix Q is called an orthogonal matrix if
QQT = QT Q = I.
Thus an orthogonal matrix is one whose inverse is equal to its transpose.
First note that if a matrix is orthogonal this says
∑

QTij Qjk =

Thus

This shows that orthogonal transformations preserve distances. You can show that if you
have a matrix which does preserve distances, then it must be orthogonal also.
Example 5.7.2 One of the most important examples of an orthogonal matrix is the so
called Householder matrix. You have v a unit vector and you form the matrix
I − 2vvT
This is an orthogonal matrix which is also symmetric. To see this, you use the rules of
matrix operations.
(

I − 2vvT

(

= I T − 2vvT
= I − 2vvT

5.7. THE QR FACTORIZATION

131

so it is symmetric. Now to show it is orthogonal,
(
)(
)
I − 2vvT I − 2vvT
= I − 2vvT − 2vvT + 4vvT vvT
= I − 4vvT + 4vvT = I
2

because vT v = v · v = |v| = 1. Therefore, this is an example of an orthogonal matrix.
Consider the following problem.
Problem 5.7.3 Given two vectors x, y such that |x| = |y| ̸= 0 but x ̸= y and you want an
orthogonal matrix Q such that Qx = y and Qy = x. The thing which works is the Householder matrix

Q≡I −2

|x − y|
Here is why this works.

Hence

Adding these equations, 2Qx = 2y and subtracting them yields 2Qy = 2x.
A picture of the geometric signiﬁcance follows.

The orthogonal matrix Q reﬂects across the dotted line taking x to y and y to x.

matrices, Q orthogonal and R upper triangular (right triangular) having all the entries on
the main diagonal nonnegative such that A = QR.

SOME FACTORIZATIONS

With the solution to this simple problem, here is how to obtain a QR factorization for
any matrix A. Let
A = (a1 , a2 , · · · , an )
where the ai are the columns. If a1 = 0, let Q1 = I. If a1 ̸= 0, let

(

where A2 is a m−1×n−1 matrix. Now ﬁnd in the same way as was just done a m−1×m−1

Continuing this way until the result is upper triangular, you get a sequence of orthogonal
matrices Qp Qp−1 · · · Q1 such that
Qp Qp−1 · · · Q1 A = R

(5.4)

where R is upper triangular.
Now if Q1 and Q2 are orthogonal, then from properties of matrix multiplication,
T

Q1 Q2 (Q1 Q2 ) = Q1 Q2 QT2 QT1 = Q1 IQT1 = I
and similarly
T

(Q1 Q2 ) Q1 Q2 = I.
Thus the product of orthogonal matrices is orthogonal. Also the transpose of an orthogonal
matrix is orthogonal directly from the deﬁnition. Therefore, from (5.4)
T

A = (Qp Qp−1 · · · Q1 ) R ≡ QR.
This proves the following theorem.

Linear Programming
6.1

Simple Geometric Considerations

One of the most important uses of row operations is in solving linear program problems
which involve maximizing a linear function subject to inequality constraints determined
from linear equations. Here is an example. A certain hamburger store has 9000 hamburger
patties to use in one week and a limitless supply of special sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions,
and buns. They sell two types of hamburgers, the big stack and the basic burger. It has also
been determined that the employees cannot prepare more than 9000 of either type in one
week. The big stack, popular with the teenagers from the local high school, involves two
patties, lots of delicious sauce, condiments galore, and a divider between the two patties.
The basic burger, very popular with children, involves only one patty and some pickles
and ketchup. Demand for the basic burger is twice what it is for the big stack. What
is the maximum number of hamburgers which could be sold in one week given the above
limitations?
Let x be the number of basic burgers and y the number of big stacks which could be sold
in a week. Thus it is desired to maximize z = x + y subject to the above constraints. The
total number of patties is 9000 and so the number of patty used is x+2y. This number must
satisfy x + 2y ≤ 9000 because there are only 9000 patty available. Because of the limitation
on the number the employees can prepare and the demand, it follows 2x + y ≤ 9000.
You never sell a negative number of hamburgers and so x, y ≥ 0. In simpler terms the
problem reduces to maximizing z = x + y subject to the two constraints, x + 2y ≤ 9000 and
2x + y ≤ 9000. This problem is pretty easy to solve geometrically. Consider the following
picture in which R labels the region described by the above inequalities and the line z = x+y
is shown for a particular value of z.

x+y =z

2x + y = 4

R

x + 2y = 4

As you make z larger this line moves away from the origin, always having the same slope
135

136

LINEAR PROGRAMMING

and the desired solution would consist of a point in the region, R which makes z as large as
possible or equivalently one for which the line is as far as possible from the origin. Clearly
this point is the point of intersection of the two lines, (3000, 3000) and so the maximum
value of the given function is 6000. Of course this type of procedure is ﬁne for a situation in
which there are only two variables but what about a similar problem in which there are very
many variables. In reality, this hamburger store makes many more types of burgers than
those two and there are many considerations other than demand and available patty. Each
will likely give you a constraint which must be considered in order to solve a more realistic
problem and the end result will likely be a problem in many dimensions, probably many
more than three so your ability to draw a picture will get you nowhere for such a problem.
Another method is needed. This method is the topic of this section. I will illustrate with
this particular problem. Let x1 = x and y = x2 . Also let x3 and x4 be nonnegative variables
such that
x1 + 2x2 + x3 = 9000, 2x1 + x2 + x4 = 9000.
To say that x3 and x4 are nonnegative is the same as saying x1 + 2x2 ≤ 9000 and 2x1 + x2 ≤
9000 and these variables are called slack variables at this point. They are called this because
they “take up the slack”. I will discuss these more later. First a general situation is
considered.

6.2

The Simplex Tableau

Here is some notation.
Deﬁnition 6.2.1 Let x, y be vectors in Rq . Then x ≤ y means for each i, xi ≤ yi .
The problem is as follows:
Let A be an m × (m + n) real matrix of rank m. It is desired to ﬁnd x ∈ Rn+m such
that x satisﬁes the constraints,
x ≥ 0, Ax = b
(6.1)
and out of all such x,
z≡

m+n
∑

i=1

is as large (or small) as possible. This is usually referred to as maximizing or minimizing z
subject to the( above constraints.) First I will consider the constraints.
Let A = a1 · · · an+m . First you ﬁnd a vector, x0 ≥ 0, Ax0 = b such that n of
the components of this vector equal 0. Letting i1 , · · · , in be the positions of x0 for which
x0i = 0, suppose also that {aj1 , · · · , ajm } is linearly independent for ji the other positions
of x0 . Geometrically, this means that x0 is a corner of the feasible region, those x which
satisfy the constraints. This is called a basic feasible solution. Also deﬁne
cB

and

a solution to the system of equations corresponding to the system of equations represented
by (6.6) and row operations leave solution sets unchanged. Note how attractive this is. The
z0 is the value of z at the point x0 . The augmented matrix of (6.9) is called the simplex
tableau and it is the beginning point for the simplex algorithm to be described a little
later. It is very convenient to express the simplex(tableau
) in the above form in which the
I
variables are possibly permuted in order to have
on the left side. However, as far
0
as the simplex algorithm is concerned it is not necessary to be permuting the variables in
this manner. Starting with (6.9) you could permute the variables and columns to obtain an
augmented matrix in which the variables are in their original order. What is really required
for the simplex tableau?
It is an augmented m + 1 × m + n + 2 matrix which represents a system of equations
T
which has the same set of solutions, (x,z) as the system whose augmented matrix is
(
)
A 0 b
−c 1 0
(Possibly the variables for x are taken in another order.) There are m linearly independent
columns in the ﬁrst m + n columns for which there is only one nonzero entry, a 1 in one of
the ﬁrst m rows, the “simple columns”, the other ﬁrst m + n columns being the “nonsimple
columns”. As in the above, the variables corresponding to the simple columns are xB ,
the basic variables and those corresponding to the nonsimple columns are xF , the free
variables. Also, the top m entries of the last column on the right are nonnegative. This is
the description of a simplex tableau.
In a simplex tableau it is easy to spot a basic feasible solution. You can see one quickly
by setting the variables, xF corresponding to the nonsimple columns equal to zero. Then
the other variables, corresponding to the simple columns are each equal to a nonnegative
entry in the far right column. Lets call this an “obvious basic feasible solution”. If a
solution is obtained by setting the variables corresponding to the nonsimple columns equal
to zero and the variables corresponding to the simple columns equal to zero this will be
referred to as an “obvious” solution. Lets also call the ﬁrst m + n entries in the bottom
row the “bottom left row”. In a simplex tableau, the entry in the bottom right corner gives
the value of the variable being maximized or minimized when the obvious basic feasible
solution is chosen.
The following is a special case of the general theory presented above and shows how such
a special case can be ﬁt into the above framework. The following example is rather typical
of the sorts of problems considered. It involves inequality constraints instead of Ax = b.
This is handled by adding in “slack variables” as explained below.
The idea is to obtain an augmented matrix for the constraints such that obvious solutions
are also feasible. Then there is an algorithm, to be presented later, which takes you from
one obvious feasible solution to another until you obtain the maximum.
Example 6.2.2 Consider z = x1 −x2 subject to the constraints, x1 +2x2 ≤ 10, x1 +2x2 ≥ 2,
and 2x1 + x2 ≤ 6, xi ≥ 0. Find a simplex tableau for a problem of the form x ≥ 0,Ax = b
which is equivalent to the above problem.
You add in slack variables. These are positive variables, one for each of the ﬁrst three constraints, which change the ﬁrst three inequalities into equations. Thus the ﬁrst three inequalities become x1 +2x2 +x3 = 10, x1 +2x2 −x4 = 2, and 2x1 +x2 +x5 = 6, x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ≥ 0.
Now it is necessary to ﬁnd a basic feasible solution. You mainly need to ﬁnd a positive so-

lution to the equations,
x1 + 2x2 + x3 = 10
x1 + 2x2 − x4 = 2
2x1 + x2 + x5 = 6
the solution set for the above system is given by
x2 =

An easy way to get a basic feasible solution is to let x4 = 8 and x5 = 1. Then a feasible
solution is
(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) = (0, 5, 0, 8, 1) .

It follows z 0 = −5 and the matrix (6.2),

The obvious solution is not feasible because of that -1 in the fourth column. When you let

select the 2 as a pivot to zero out that which is above and below the 2.

This one is good. When you let x1 = x4 = 0, you ﬁnd that x2 = 3, x3 = 4, x5 = 3. The
obvious solution is now feasible. You can now assemble the simplex tableau. The ﬁrst step
is to include a column and row for z. This yields

Now you need to get zeros in the right places so the simple columns will be preserved as
simple columns in this larger matrix. This means you need to zero out the 1 in the third
column on the bottom. A simplex tableau is now

basic feasible point of the region determined by the constraints.

6.3.1

The Simplex Algorithm
Maximums

The simplex algorithm takes you from one basic feasible solution to another while maximizing or minimizing the function you are trying to maximize or minimize. Algebraically,
it takes you from one simplex tableau to another in which the lower right corner either
increases in the case of maximization or decreases in the case of minimization.
I will continue writing the simplex tableau in such a way that the simple columns having
only one entry nonzero are on the left. As explained above, this amounts to permuting the
variables. I will do this because it is possible to describe what is going on without onerous
notation. However, in the examples, I won’t worry so much about it. Thus, from a basic
feasible solution, a simplex tableau of the following form has been obtained in which the
columns for the basic variables, xB are listed ﬁrst and b ≥ 0.

system and since b ≥ 0, it follows x , z is a basic feasible solution.
(

F
If ci < 0 for some i, and if Fji ≤ 0 so that a whole column of
is ≤ 0 with the
c
bottom entry < 0, then letting xi be the variable corresponding to that column, you could
leave all the other entries of xF equal to zero but change xi to be positive. Let the new
vector be denoted by x′F and letting x′B = b − F x′F it follows
∑
(x′B )k = bk −
Fkj (xF )j
j

= bk − Fki xi ≥ 0
Now this shows (x′B , x′F ) is feasible whenever xi > 0 and so you could let xi become
arbitrarily large and positive and conclude there is no maximum for z because
z = (−ci ) xi + z 0

(6.11)

If this happens in a simplex tableau, you can say there is no maximum and stop.
What if c ≥ 0? Then z = z 0 − cxF and to satisfy the constraints, you need xF ≥ 0.
Therefore, in this case, z 0 is the largest possible value of z and so the maximum has been
found. You stop when this occurs. Next I explain what to do if neither of the above stopping
conditions hold.
(The only
) case which remains is that some ci < 0 and some Fji > 0. You pick a column
F
in
in which ci < 0, usually the one for which ci is the largest in absolute value.
c
You pick Fji > 0 as a pivot element, divide the j th row by Fji and then use to obtain
zeros above Fji and below Fji , thus obtaining a new simple column. This row operation
also makes exactly one of the other simple columns into a nonsimple column. (In terms of
variables, it is said that a free variable becomes a basic variable and a basic variable becomes
a free variable.) Now permuting the columns and variables, yields
(
)
I F ′ 0 b′
0 c′ 1 z 0′
( )
bj
where z 0′ ≥ z 0 because z 0′ = z 0 − ci Fji
and ci < 0. If b′ ≥ 0, you are in the same
position you were at the beginning but now z 0 is larger. Now here is the important thing.
You don’t pick just any Fji when you do these row operations. You pick the positive one
for which the row operation results in b′ ≥ 0. Otherwise the obvious basic feasible
solution obtained by letting x′F = 0 will fail to satisfy the constraint that x ≥ 0.
How is this done? You need
b′k ≡ bk −

for each k = 1, · · · , m or equivalently,

Now if Fki ≤ 0 the above holds. Therefore, you only need to check Fpi for Fpi > 0. The
pivot, Fji is the one which makes the quotients of the form

Having gotten a new simplex tableau, you do the same thing to it which was just done
and continue. As long as b > 0, so you don’t encounter the degenerate case, the values
for z associated with setting xF = 0 keep getting strictly larger every time the process is
repeated. You keep going until you ﬁnd c ≥ 0. Then you stop. You are at a maximum.
Problems can occur in the process in the so called degenerate case when at some stage of
the process some bj = 0. In this case you can cycle through diﬀerent values for x with no
improvement in z. This case will not be discussed here.

0 0 1
1 0 4 
0 1 5

Now this one is all right because the obvious solution is feasible. Letting x2 = x3 = 0,
it follows that the obvious solution is feasible. Now we add in the objective function as
described above.



Then do row operations to leave the simple columns

the same. Then




Now there are negative numbers on the bottom row to the left of the 1. Lets pick the ﬁrst.
(It would be more sensible to pick the second.) The ratios to look at are 5/1, 1/1 so pick for

the pivot the 1 in the second column and ﬁrst row. This will leave the right column above
the lower right corner nonnegative. Thus the next tableau is


1 1 −1 0 0 0 1
 1 0 1 1 0 0 5 


 −1 0 2 0 1 0 4 
1 0 −3 0 0 1 3
There is still a negative number there to the left of the 1 in the bottom row. The new ratios
are 4/2, 5/1 so the new pivot is the 2 in the third column. Thus the next tableau is

 1

Still, there is a negative number in the bottom row to the left of the 1 so the process does
not stop yet. The ratios are 3/ (3/2) and 3/ (1/2) and so the new pivot is that 3/2 in the
ﬁrst column. Thus the new tableau is



Now stop. The maximum value is 10. This is an easy enough problem to do geometrically
and so you can easily verify that this is the right answer. It occurs when x4 = x5 = 0, x1 =
2, x2 = 2, x3 = 3.

6.3.2

Minimums

How does it diﬀer if you are ﬁnding a minimum? From a basic feasible solution, a simplex
tableau of the following form has been obtained in which the simple columns for the basic
variables, xB are listed ﬁrst and b ≥ 0.
(
)
I F 0 b
(6.14)
0 c 1 z0
(
)
Let x0i = bi for i = 1, · · · , m and x0i (= 0 for) i > m. Then x0 , z 0 is a solution to the above
system and since b ≥ 0, it follows x0 , z 0 is a basic feasible solution. So far, there is no
change.
Suppose ﬁrst that some ci > 0 and Fji ≤ 0 for each j. Then let x′F consist of changing xi
by making it positive but leaving the other entries of xF equal to 0. Then from the bottom
row,
z = −ci xi + z 0
and you let x′B = b − F x′F ≥ 0. Thus the constraints continue to hold when xi is made
increasingly positive and it follows from the above equation that there is no minimum for
z. You stop when this happens.
Next suppose c ≤ 0. Then in this case, z = z 0 − cxF and from the constraints, xF ≥ 0
and so −cxF ≥ 0 and so z 0 is the minimum value and you stop since this is what you are
looking for.
What do you do in the case where some ci > 0 and some Fji > 0? In this case, you use
the simplex algorithm as in the case of maximums to obtain a new simplex tableau in which

144

LINEAR PROGRAMMING

z 0′ is smaller. You choose Fji the same way to be the positive entry of the ith column such
that bp /Fpi ≥ bj /Fji for all positive entries, Fpi and do the same row operations. Now this
time,
(
)
bj
0′
0
z = z − ci
< z0
Fji
As in the case of maximums no problem can occur and the process will converge unless
you have the degenerate case in which some bj = 0. As in the earlier case, this is most
unfortunate when it occurs. You see what happens of course. z 0 does not change and the
algorithm just delivers diﬀerent values of the variables forever with no improvement.
To summarize the geometrical signiﬁcance of the simplex algorithm, it takes you from one
corner of the feasible region to another. You go in one direction to ﬁnd the maximum and
in another to ﬁnd the minimum. For the maximum you try to get rid of negative entries of c
and for minimums you try to eliminate positive entries of c, where the method of elimination
involves the auspicious use of an appropriate pivot element and row operations.
Now return to Example 6.2.2. It will be modiﬁed to be a maximization problem.
Example 6.3.2 Maximize z = x1 − x2 subject to the constraints,
x1 + 2x2 ≤ 10, x1 + 2x2 ≥ 2,
and 2x1 + x2 ≤ 6, xi ≥ 0.
Recall this is the same as maximizing z = x1 − x2 subject to


the variables, x3 , x4 , x5 being slack variables. Recall the simplex tableau was


with the variables ordered as x2 , x4 , x5 , x1 , x3 and so xB = (x2 , x4 , x5 ) and
xF = (x1 , x3 ) .
Apply the simplex algorithm to the fourth column because − 32 < 0 and this is the most
negative entry in the bottom row. The pivot is 3/2 because 1/(3/2) = 2/3 < 5/ (1/2) .
Dividing this row by 3/2 and then using this to zero out the other elements in that column,
the new simplex tableau is


2
0 14

.

 0 0
1 − 13 0 23 
3
0 0 1 0 −1 1 −4
Now there is still a negative number in the bottom left row. Therefore, the process should
be continued. This time the pivot is the 2/3 in the top of the column. Dividing the top row

by 2/3 and then using this to zero out the entries below it,

Now all the numbers on the bottom left row are nonnegative so the process stops. Now
recall the variables and columns were ordered as x2 , x4 , x5 , x1 , x3 . The solution in terms of
x1 and x2 is x2 = 0 and x1 = 3 and z = 3. Note that in the above, I did not worry about
permuting the columns to keep those which go with the basic variables on the left.
Here is a bucolic example.
Example 6.3.3 Consider the following table.

This information is available to a pig farmer and Fi denotes a particular feed. The numbers
in the table contain the number of units of a particular nutrient contained in one pound of
the given feed. Thus F2 has 2 units of iron in one pound. Now suppose the cost of each feed
in cents per pound is given in the following table.

A typical pig needs 5 units of iron, 8 of protein, 6 of folic acid, 7 of copper and 4 of calcium.
(The units may change from nutrient to nutrient.) How many pounds of each feed per pig
should the pig farmer use in order to minimize his cost?
His problem is to minimize C ≡ 2x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 subject to the constraints

How in the world can you ﬁnd a basic feasible solution? Remember the simplex algorithm
is designed to keep the entries in the right column nonnegative so you use this algorithm a
few times till the obvious solution is a basic feasible solution.
Consider the ﬁrst column. The pivot is the 5. Using the row operations described in the
algorithm, you get

Now go to the second column. The pivot in this column is the 7/5. This is in a diﬀerent
row than the pivot in the ﬁrst column so I will use it to zero out everything below it. This
will get rid of the zeros in the ﬁfth column and introduce zeros in the second. This yields


Now consider another column, this time the fourth. I will pick this one because it has
some negative numbers in it so there are fewer entries to check in looking for a pivot.
Unfortunately, the pivot is the top 2 and I don’t want to pivot on this because it would
destroy the zeros in the second column. Consider the ﬁfth column. It is also not a good
choice because the pivot is the second element from the top and this would destroy the zeros
in the ﬁrst column. Consider the sixth column. I can use either of the two bottom entries
as the pivot. The matrix is



Next consider the third column. The pivot



 0 0 1 −2 1

 0 0 0 −1 0

There are still 5 columns which consist entirely of zeros except for one entry. Four of them
have that entry equal to 1 but one still has a -1 in it, the -1 being in the fourth column.

I need to do the row operations on a nonsimple column which has the pivot in the fourth
row. Such a column is the second to the last. The pivot is the 3. The new matrix is



Now the obvious basic solution is feasible. You let x4 = 0 = x5 = x7 = x8 and x1 =
8/3, x2 = 2/3, x3 = 1, and x6 = 28/3. You don’t need to worry too much about this. It is
the above matrix which is desired. Now you can assemble the simplex tableau and begin
the algorithm. Remember C ≡ 2x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 . First add the row and column which
deal with C. This yields



Now you do row operations to keep the simple columns of (6.15) simple in (6.16). Of course
you could permute the columns if you wanted but this is not necessary.
This yields the following for a simplex tableau. Now it is a matter of getting rid of the
positive entries in the bottom row because you are trying to minimize.

The most positive of them is the 2/3 and so I will apply the algorithm to this one ﬁrst. The
pivot is the 7/3. After doing the row operation the next tableau is

and you see that all the entries are negative and so the minimum is 64/7 and it occurs when
x1 = 18/7, x2 = 0, x3 = 11/7, x4 = 2/7.
There is no maximum for the above problem. However, I will pretend I don’t know this
and attempt to use the simplex algorithm. You set up the simiplex tableau the same way.

also how there is no way to pick the pivot in that column.
Example 6.3.4 Minimize z = x1 − 3x2 + x3 subject to the constraints x1 + x2 + x3 ≤
10, x1 + x2 + x3 ≥ 2, x1 + x2 + 3x3 ≤ 8 and x1 + 2x2 + x3 ≤ 7 with all variables nonnegative.
There exists an answer because the region deﬁned by the constraints is closed and
bounded. Adding in slack variables you get the following augmented matrix corresponding
to the constraints.

6.3. THE SIMPLEX ALGORITHM

149

Of course there is a problem with the obvious solution obtained by setting to zero all
variables corresponding to a nonsimple column because of the simple column which has the
−1 in it. Therefore, I will use the simplex algorithm to make this column non simple. The
third column has the 1 in the second row as the pivot so I will use this column. This yields


0
0 0 1 1 0 0 8
 1
1 1 0 −1 0 0 2 


(6.17)
 −2 −2 0 0 3 1 0 2 
0
1 0 0 1 0 1 5
and the obvious solution is feasible. Now it is time to assemble the simplex tableau. First
add in the bottom row and second to last column corresponding to the equation for z. This
yields


0
0
0 1 1 0 0 0 8
 1
1
1 0 −1 0 0 0 2 



 0
1
0 0 1 0 1 0 5 
−1 3 −1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Next you need to zero out the entries in the bottom
columns in (6.17). This yields the simplex tableau

0
0 0 1 1 0
 1
1 1 0 −1 0

 −2 −2 0 0 3 1


row which are below one of the simple

0 0 8
0 0 2 

0 0 2 
.
1 0 5 
0 1 2

The desire is to minimize this so you need to get rid of the positive entries in the left bottom
row. There is only one such entry, the 4. In that column the pivot is the 1 in the second
row of this column. Thus the next tableau is


0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 8
 1 1 1 0 −1 0 0 0 2 


 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 6 


 −1 0 −1 0 2 0 1 0 3 
−4 0 −4 0 3 0 0 1 −6
There is still a positive number there, the 3. The
algorithm again. This yields
 1

Now all the entries in the left bottom row are nonpositive so the process has stopped. The
minimum is −21/2. It occurs when x1 = 0, x2 = 7/2, x3 = 0.
Now consider the same problem but change the word, minimize to the word, maximize.
Example 6.3.5 Maximize z = x1 − 3x2 + x3 subject to the constraints x1 + x2 + x3 ≤
10, x1 + x2 + x3 ≥ 2, x1 + x2 + 3x3 ≤ 8 and x1 + 2x2 + x3 ≤ 7 with all variables nonnegative.

Finding A Basic Feasible Solution

By now it should be fairly clear that ﬁnding a basic feasible solution can create considerable
diﬃculty. Indeed, given a system of linear inequalities along with the requirement that each
variable be nonnegative, do there even exist points satisfying all these inequalities? If you
have many variables, you can’t answer this by drawing a picture. Is there some other way
to do this which is more systematic than what was presented above? The answer is yes. It
is called the method of artiﬁcial variables. I will illustrate this method with an example.
Example 6.4.1 Find a basic feasible solution to the system 2x1 +x2 −x3 ≥ 3, x1 +x2 +x3 ≥
2, x1 + x2 + x3 ≤ 7 and x ≥ 0.
If you write the appropriate augmented

2 1 −1
 1 1 1
1 1 1

matrix with the slack variables,

−1 0 0 3
0 −1 0 2 
0
0 1 7

(6.18)

The obvious solution is not feasible. This is why it would be hard to get started with
the simplex method. What is the problem? It is those −1 entries in the fourth and ﬁfth
columns. To get around this, you add in artiﬁcial variables to get an augmented matrix of
the form


2 1 −1 −1 0 0 1 0 3
 1 1 1
0 −1 0 0 1 2 

6.4. FINDING A BASIC FEASIBLE SOLUTION

151

Thus the variables are x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 , x8 . Suppose you can ﬁnd a feasible solution
to the system of equations represented by the above augmented matrix. Thus all variables
are nonnegative. Suppose also that it can be done in such a way that x8 and x7 happen
to be 0. Then it will follow that x1 , · · · , x6 is a feasible solution for (6.18). Conversely, if
you can ﬁnd a feasible solution for (6.18), then letting x7 and x8 both equal zero, you have
obtained a feasible solution to (6.19). Since all variables are nonnegative, x7 and x8 both
equalling zero is equivalent to saying the minimum of z = x7 + x8 subject to the constraints
represented by the above augmented matrix equals zero. This has proved the following
simple observation.
Observation 6.4.2 There exists a feasible solution to the constraints represented by the
augmented matrix of (6.18) and x ≥ 0 if and only if the minimum of x7 + x8 subject to the
constraints of (6.19) and x ≥ 0 exists and equals 0.
Of course a similar observation would hold in other similar situations. Now the point of
all this is that it is trivial to see a feasible solution to (6.19), namely x6 = 7, x7 = 3, x8 = 2
and all the other variables may be set to equal zero. Therefore, it is easy to ﬁnd an initial
simplex tableau for the minimization problem just described. First add the column and row
for z


2 1 −1 −1 0 0 1
0 0 3
 1 1 1
0 −1 0 0
1 0 2 


 1 1 1
0
0 1 0
0 0 7 
0 0 0
0
0 0 −1 −1 1 0
Next it is necessary to make the last two columns on the bottom left row into simple columns.
Performing the row operation, this yields an initial simplex tableau,


2 1 −1 −1 0 0 1 0 0 3
 1 1 1
0 −1 0 0 1 0 2 


 1 1 1
0
0 1 0 0 0 7 
3 2 0 −1 −1 0 0 0 1 5
Now the algorithm involves getting rid of the positive entries on the left bottom row. Begin
with the ﬁrst column. The pivot is the 2. An application of the simplex algorithm yields
the new tableau


1
1 12 − 12 − 12

Now go to the third column. The pivot is the
simplex algorithm yields

1 23 0 − 13 − 13

 0 1 1
− 23

(6.20)

and you see there are only nonpositive numbers on the bottom left column so the process
stops and yields 0 for the minimum of z = x7 +x8 . As for the other variables, x1 = 5/3, x2 =
0, x3 = 1/3, x4 = 0, x5 = 0, x6 = 5. Now as explained in the above observation, this is a
basic feasible solution for the original system (6.18).
Now consider a maximization problem associated with the above constraints.

Example 6.4.3 Maximize x1 − x2 + 2x3 subject to the constraints, 2x1 + x2 − x3 ≥ 3, x1 +
x2 + x3 ≥ 2, x1 + x2 + x3 ≤ 7 and x ≥ 0.
From (6.20) you can immediately assemble an initial simplex tableau. You begin with
the ﬁrst 6 columns and top 3 rows in (6.20). Then add in the column and row for z. This
yields



0 − 13 − 13 0 0 53

the next simplex tableau is

You are trying to get rid of negative entries in the bottom left row. There is only one, the
−5/3. The pivot is the 1. The next simplex tableau is then


1 23 0 − 13 0 13 0 10

1
 0 1 1


 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 5 

3
and so the maximum value of z is 32/3 and it occurs when x1 = 10/3, x2 = 0 and x3 = 11/3.

6.5

Duality

You can solve minimization problems by solving maximization problems. You can also go
the other direction and solve maximization problems by minimization problems. Sometimes
this makes things much easier. To be more speciﬁc, the two problems to be considered are
A.) Minimize z = cx subject to x ≥ 0 and Ax ≥ b and
B.) Maximize w = yb such that y ≥ 0 and yA ≤ c,
(
)
equivalently AT yT ≥ cT and w = bT yT .
In these problems it is assumed A is an m × p matrix.
I will show how a solution of the ﬁrst yields a solution of the second and then show how
a solution of the second yields a solution of the ﬁrst. The problems, A.) and B.) are called
dual problems.
Lemma 6.5.1 Let x be a solution of the inequalities of A.) and let y be a solution of the
inequalities of B.). Then
cx ≥ yb.
and if equality holds in the above, then x is the solution to A.) and y is a solution to B.).
Proof: This follows immediately. Since c ≥ yA, cx ≥ yAx ≥ yb.
It follows from this lemma that if y satisﬁes the inequalities of B.) and x satisﬁes the
inequalities of A.) then if equality holds in the above lemma, it must be that x is a solution
of A.) and y is a solution of B.). 

Now recall that to solve either of these problems using the simplex method, you ﬁrst
add in slack variables. Denote by x′ and y′ the enlarged list of variables. Thus x′ has at
least m entries and so does y′ and the inequalities involving A were replaced by equalities
whose augmented matrices were of the form
(
)
(
)
A −I b , and AT I cT
Then you included the row and column for z and w to obtain
(
)
(
)
A −I 0 b
AT
I 0 cT
and
.
−c 0 1 0
−bT 0 1 0

(6.21)

Then the problems have basic feasible solutions if it is possible to permute the ﬁrst p + m
columns in the above two matrices and obtain matrices of the form
(
)
(
)
B1
F1
0 cT
B
F
0 b
and
(6.22)
−bTB1 −bTF1 1 0
−cB −cF 1 0
where B, B1 are invertible m × m and p × p matrices and denoting the variables associated
with these columns by xB , yB and those variables associated with F or F1 by xF and yF ,
it follows
that )letting BxB = b and xF = 0, the resulting vector, x′ is a solution to x′ ≥ 0
(
and A −I x′ = b with similar constraints holding for y′ . In other words, it is possible
to obtain simplex tableaus,

0 bTB1 B1−1 F − bTF1 1 bTB1 B1−1 cT
Similar considerations apply to the second problem. Thus as just described, a basic feasible
solution is one which determines a simplex tableau like the above in which you get a feasible
solution by setting all but the ﬁrst m variables equal to zero. The simplex algorithm takes
you from one basic feasible solution to another till eventually, if there is no degeneracy, you
obtain a basic feasible solution which yields the solution of the problem of interest.
Theorem 6.5.2 Suppose there exists a solution x to A.) where x is a basic feasible solution
of the inequalities of A.). Then there exists a solution y to B.) and cx = by. It is also
possible to ﬁnd y from x using a simple formula.
Proof: Since the solution to A.) is basic and feasible, there exists a simplex tableau
like (6.23) such that x′ can be split into xB and xF such that xF = 0 and xB = B −1 b.
Now since it is a minimizer, it follows cB B −1 F − cF ≤ 0 and the minimum value for cx is
cB B −1 b. Stating this again, cx = cB B −1 b. Is it possible you can take y = cB B −1 ? From

Lemma 6.5.1 this will be so if cB B −1 solves the constraints of problem B.). Is
( cB B ≥) 0?

Is

( cB B ) A ≤ c? These two conditions are satisﬁed if and only if cB B

matrix
(
)
of (6.21)
to )get (6.22) and doing the same permutations on the( columns) of ( A −I )
(
−1
and c 0 , the desired inequality
holds if and
(
) only
( if cB B ) B F ≤ cB cF
−1
which is equivalent to saying cB cB B F
≤ cB cF
and this is true because
cB B −1 F − cF ≤ 0 due to the assumption that x is a minimizer. The simple formula is just
y = cB B −1 . 
The proof of the following corollary is similar.
Corollary 6.5.3 Suppose there exists a solution, y to B.) where y is a basic feasible solution
of the inequalities of B.). Then there exists a solution, x to A.) and cx = by. It is also
possible to ﬁnd x from y using a simple formula. In this case, and referring to (6.23), the
simple formula is x = B1−T bB1 .

As an example, consider the pig farmers problem. The main diﬃculty in this problem
was ﬁnding an initial simplex tableau. Now consider the following example and marvel at

Two good books which give more discussion of linear programming are Strang [25] and
Nobel and Daniels [20]. Also listed in these books are other references which may prove
useful if you are interested in seeing more on these topics. There is a great deal more which

Spectral Theory
Spectral Theory refers to the study of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. It is of
fundamental importance in many areas. Row operations will no longer be such a useful tool
in this subject.

7.1

Eigenvalues And Eigenvectors Of A Matrix

The ﬁeld of scalars in spectral theory is best taken to equal C although I will sometimes
refer to it as F when it could be either C or R.
Deﬁnition 7.1.1 Let M be an n × n matrix and let x ∈ Cn be a nonzero vector for which
M x = λx

(7.1)

for some scalar, λ. Then x is called an eigenvector and λ is called an eigenvalue (characteristic value) of the matrix M.
Eigenvectors are never equal to zero!
The set of all eigenvalues of an n × n matrix M, is denoted by σ (M ) and is referred to as
the spectrum of M.
Eigenvectors are vectors which are shrunk, stretched or reﬂected upon multiplication by
a matrix. How can they be identiﬁed? Suppose x satisﬁes (7.1). Then
(λI − M ) x = 0
for some x ̸= 0. Therefore, the matrix M − λI cannot have an inverse and so by Theorem
3.3.18
det (λI − M ) = 0.
(7.2)
In other words, λ must be a zero of the characteristic polynomial. Since M is an n×n matrix,
it follows from the theorem on expanding a matrix by its cofactor that this is a polynomial
equation of degree n. As such, it has a solution, λ ∈ C. Is it actually an eigenvalue? The
answer is yes and this follows from Theorem 3.3.26 on Page 95. Since det (λI − M ) = 0
the matrix λI − M cannot be one to one and so there exists a nonzero vector, x such that
(λI − M ) x = 0. This proves the following corollary.
Corollary 7.1.2 Let M be an n×n matrix and det (M − λI) = 0. Then there exists x ∈ Cn
such that (M − λI) x = 0.

SPECTRAL THEORY

As an example, consider the following.
Example 7.1.3 Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the matrix


5 −10 −5
14

A= 2

You ﬁrst need to identify the eigenvalues. Recall this requires the solution of the equation
 

14
2  = 0
det λ  0 1 0  −  2

6
When you expand this determinant, you ﬁnd the equation is
(
)
(λ − 5) λ2 − 20λ + 100 = 0
and so the eigenvalues are
5, 10, 10.
I have listed 10 twice because it is a zero of multiplicity two due to
2

λ2 − 20λ + 100 = (λ − 10) .
Having found the eigenvalues, it only remains to ﬁnd the eigenvectors. First ﬁnd the
eigenvectors for λ = 5. As explained above, this requires you to solve the equation,
 
 
 

solution. Thus the matrix you must row reduce is

where z ∈ F. You would obtain the same collection of vectors if you replaced z with 4z.
Thus a simpler description for the solutions to this system of equations whose augmented
matrix is in (7.3) is


5
z  −2 
(7.4)
4
where z ∈ F. Now you need to remember that you can’t take z = 0 because this would
result in the zero vector and
Eigenvectors are never equal to zero!
Other than this value, every other choice of z in (7.4) results in an eigenvector. It is a good
idea to check your work! To do so, I will take the original matrix and multiply by this vector
and see if I get 5 times this vector.

so it appears this is correct. Always check your work on these problems if you care about
getting the answer right.
The variable, z is called a free variable or sometimes a parameter. The set of vectors in
(7.4) is called the eigenspace and it equals ker (λI − A) . You should observe that in this case
the eigenspace has dimension 1 because there is one vector which spans the eigenspace. In
general, you obtain the solution from the row echelon form and the number of diﬀerent free
variables gives you the dimension of the eigenspace. Just remember that not every vector
in the eigenspace is an eigenvector. The vector, 0 is not an eigenvector although it is in the
eigenspace because
Eigenvectors are never equal to zero!
Next consider the eigenvectors for λ = 10. These vectors are solutions to the equation,

You can’t pick z and y both equal to zero because this would result in the zero vector and
Eigenvectors are never equal to zero!
However, every other choice of z and y does result in an eigenvector for the eigenvalue
λ = 10. As in the case for λ = 5 you should check your work if you care about getting it
right.

so it worked. The other vector will also work. Check it.
The above example shows how to ﬁnd eigenvectors and eigenvalues algebraically. You
may have noticed it is a bit long. Sometimes students try to ﬁrst row reduce the matrix
before looking for eigenvalues. This is a terrible idea because row operations destroy the
value of the eigenvalues. The eigenvalue problem is really not about row operations. A
general rule to remember about the eigenvalue problem is this.
If it is not long and hard it is usually wrong!
The eigenvalue problem is the hardest problem in algebra and people still do research on
ways to ﬁnd eigenvalues. Now if you are so fortunate as to ﬁnd the eigenvalues as in the
above example, then ﬁnding the eigenvectors does reduce to row operations and this part
of the problem is easy. However, ﬁnding the eigenvalues is anything but easy because for
an n × n matrix, it involves solving a polynomial equation of degree n and none of us are
very good at doing this. If you only ﬁnd a good approximation to the eigenvalue, it won’t
work. It either is or is not an eigenvalue and if it is not, the only solution to the equation,
(λI − M ) x = 0 will be the zero solution as explained above and
Eigenvectors are never equal to zero!
Here is another example.
Example 7.1.4 Let

7.1. EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS OF A MATRIX
Now ﬁnd the eigenvectors. For λ = 0 the

augmented matrix for ﬁnding the solutions is


and the row reduced echelon form is


Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form




where z ̸= 0.
Next ﬁnd the eigenvectors for λ = 2. The augmented matrix for the system of equations
needed to ﬁnd these eigenvectors is


0 −2 2 0
 −1 −1 1 0 
1 −1 1 0
and the row reduced echelon form is

and so the eigenvectors are of the form



where z ̸= 0.
Finally ﬁnd the eigenvectors for λ = 4. The augmented matrix for the system of equations
needed to ﬁnd these eigenvectors is

Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
In this case the eigenvalues are 3, 6, 6 where I have listed 6 twice because it is a zero of
algebraic multiplicity two, the characteristic equation being
2

(λ − 3) (λ − 6) = 0.
It remains to ﬁnd the eigenvectors for these eigenvalues. First consider the eigenvectors for
λ = 3. You must solve
 
 

Using routine row operations, the eigenvectors are nonzero vectors of the form





z
Next consider the eigenvectors for λ = 6. This requires you to solve

and using the usual procedures yields the eigenvectors for λ = 6 are of the form

z  − 14 

or written more simply,




−1
z  −2 

where z ∈ F.
Note that in this example the eigenspace for the eigenvalue λ = 6 is of dimension 1
because there is only one parameter which can be chosen. However, this eigenvalue is of
multiplicity two as a root to the characteristic equation.
Deﬁnition 7.1.6 If A is an n × n matrix with the property that some eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity as a root of the characteristic equation which is greater than the dimension
of the eigenspace associated with this eigenvalue, then the matrix is called defective.
There may be repeated roots to the characteristic equation, (7.2) and it is not known
whether the dimension of the eigenspace equals the multiplicity of the eigenvalue. However,
the following theorem is available.
Theorem 7.1.7 Suppose M vi = λi vi , i = 1, · · · , r , vi ̸= 0, and that if i ̸= j, then λi ̸= λj .
Then the set of eigenvectors, {v1 , · · · , vr } is linearly independent.

Proof. Suppose the claim of the lemma is not true. Then there exists a subset of this
set of vectors
{w1 , · · · , wr } ⊆ {v1 , · · · , vk }
such that

r
∑

cj wj = 0

(7.5)

j=1

where each cj ̸= 0. Say M wj = µj wj where
{µ1 , · · · , µr } ⊆ {λ1 , · · · , λk } ,
the µj being distinct eigenvalues of M . Out of all such subsets, let this one be such that r
is as small as possible. Then necessarily, r > 1 because otherwise, c1 w1 = 0 which would
imply w1 = 0, which is not allowed for eigenvectors.
Now apply M to both sides of (7.5).
r
∑

cj µj wj = 0.

(7.6)

j=1

Next pick µk ̸= 0 and multiply both sides of (7.5) by µk . Such a µk exists because r > 1.
Thus
r
∑
cj µk wj = 0
(7.7)
j=1

Subtract the sum in (7.7) from the sum in (7.6) to obtain
r
∑

(
)
cj µk − µj wj = 0

j=1

(

)
Now one of the constants cj µk − µj equals 0, when j = k. Therefore, r was not as small
as possible after all. 
In words, this theorem says that eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are
linearly independent.
Sometimes you have to consider eigenvalues which are complex numbers. This occurs in
diﬀerential equations for example. You do these problems exactly the same way as you do
the ones in which the eigenvalues are real. Here is an example.
Example 7.1.8 Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix

add to the bottom. This yields


0 0 0 0
Now multiply the second row by −i to obtain


Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form

Some Applications Of Eigenvalues And Eigenvectors

Recall that n × n matrices can be considered as linear transformations. If F is a 3 × 3 real
matrix having positive determinant, it can be shown that F = RU where R is a rotation
matrix and U is a symmetric real matrix having positive eigenvalues. An application of
this wonderful result, known to mathematicians as the right polar decomposition, is to
continuum mechanics where a chunk of material is identiﬁed with a set of points in three
dimensional space.

7.2. SOME APPLICATIONS OF EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS

165

The linear transformation, F in this context is called the deformation gradient and
it describes the local deformation of the material. Thus it is possible to consider this
deformation in terms of two processes, one which distorts the material and the other which
just rotates it. It is the matrix U which is responsible for stretching and compressing. This
is why in continuum mechanics, the stress is often taken to depend on U which is known in
this context as the right Cauchy Green strain tensor. This process of writing a matrix as a
product of two such matrices, one of which preserves distance and the other which distorts
is also important in applications to geometric measure theory an interesting ﬁeld of study
in mathematics and to the study of quadratic forms which occur in many applications such
as statistics. Here I am emphasizing the application to mechanics in which the eigenvectors
of U determine the principle directions, those directions in which the material is stretched
or compressed to the maximum extent.
Example 7.2.1 Find the principle directions determined by the matrix

The eigenvalues are 3, 1, and 21 .
It is nice to be given the eigenvalues. The largest eigenvalue is 3 which means that in
the direction determined by the eigenvector associated with 3 the stretch is three times as
large. The smallest eigenvalue is 1/2 and so in the direction determined by the eigenvector
for 1/2 the material is compressed, becoming locally half as long. It remains to ﬁnd these
directions. First consider the eigenvector for 3. It is necessary to solve

Note this is meaningful information which you would have a hard time ﬁnding without
the theory of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
Another application is to the problem of ﬁnding solutions to systems of diﬀerential
equations. It turns out that vibrating systems involving masses and springs can be studied
in the form
x′′ = Ax
(7.8)
where A is a real symmetric n × n matrix which has nonpositive eigenvalues. This is
analogous to the case of the scalar equation for undamped oscillation, x′′ + ω 2 x = 0. The
main diﬀerence is that here the scalar ω 2 is replaced with the matrix −A. Consider the
problem of ﬁnding solutions to (7.8). You look for a solution which is in the form
x (t) = veλt

(7.9)

and substitute this into (7.8). Thus
x′′ = vλ2 eλt = eλt Av
and so
λ2 v = Av.
Therefore, λ2 needs to be an eigenvalue of A and v needs to be an eigenvector. Since A
has nonpositive eigenvalues, λ2 = −a2 and so λ = ±ia where −a2 is an eigenvalue of A.
Corresponding to this you obtain solutions of the form
x (t) = v cos (at) , v sin (at) .
Note these solutions oscillate because of the cos (at) and sin (at) in the solutions. Here is
an example.

According to the above, you can ﬁnd solutions by looking for the eigenvectors. Consider

are both solutions to the system of diﬀerential equations. You can ﬁnd other oscillatory
solutions in the same way by considering the other eigenvalues. You might try checking
these answers to verify they work.
This is just a special case of a procedure used in diﬀerential equations to obtain closed
form solutions to systems of diﬀerential equations using linear algebra. The overall philosophy is to take one of the easiest problems in analysis and change it into the eigenvalue
problem which is the most diﬃcult problem in algebra. However, when it works, it gives
precise solutions in terms of known functions.

7.4. SCHUR’S THEOREM

7.4

173

Schur’s Theorem

Every matrix is related to an upper triangular matrix in a particularly signiﬁcant way. This
is Schur’s theorem and it is the most important theorem in the spectral theory of matrices.
Lemma 7.4.1 Let {x1 , · · · , xn } be a basis for Fn . Then there exists an orthonormal basis for Fn , {u1 , · · · , un } which has the property that for each k ≤ n, span(x1 , · · · , xk ) =
span (u1 , · · · , uk ) .
Proof: Let {x1 , · · · , xn } be a basis for Fn . Let u1 ≡ x1 / |x1 | . Thus for k = 1,
span (u1 ) = span (x1 ) and {u1 } is an orthonormal set. Now suppose for some k < n, u1 , · · · ,
uk have been chosen such that (uj · ul ) = δ jl and span (x1 , · · · , xk ) = span (u1 , · · · , uk ).
Then deﬁne
∑k
xk+1 − j=1 (xk+1 · uj ) uj
uk+1 ≡
,
(7.10)
∑k
xk+1 − j=1 (xk+1 · uj ) uj
where the denominator is not equal to zero because the xj form a basis and so
xk+1 ∈
/ span (x1 , · · · , xk ) = span (u1 , · · · , uk )
Thus by induction,
uk+1 ∈ span (u1 , · · · , uk , xk+1 ) = span (x1 , · · · , xk , xk+1 ) .
Also, xk+1 ∈ span (u1 , · · · , uk , uk+1 ) which is seen easily by solving (7.10) for xk+1 and it
follows
span (x1 , · · · , xk , xk+1 ) = span (u1 , · · · , uk , uk+1 ) .
If l ≤ k,


(uk+1 · ul ) = C (xk+1 · ul ) −

The vectors, {uj }j=1 , generated in this way are therefore an orthonormal basis because
each vector has unit length. 
The process by which these vectors were generated is called the Gram Schmidt process.
Here is a fundamental deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 7.4.2 An n × n matrix U, is unitary if U U ∗ = I = U ∗ U where U ∗ is deﬁned to
be the transpose of the conjugate of U.
Proposition 7.4.3 An n×n matrix is unitary if and only if the columns are an orthonormal
set.
Proof: This follows right away from the way we multiply matrices. If U is an n × n
complex matrix, then
(U ∗ U )ij = u∗i uj = (ui , uj )
and the matrix is unitary if and only if this equals δ ij if and only if the columns are
orthonormal. 

Theorem 7.4.4 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then there exists a unitary matrix U such that
U ∗ AU = T,

(7.11)

where T is an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues of A on the main diagonal
listed according to multiplicity as roots of the characteristic equation.
Proof: The theorem is clearly true if A is a 1 × 1 matrix. Just let U = 1 the 1 × 1
matrix which has 1 down the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Suppose it is true for
(n − 1) × (n − 1) matrices and let A be an n × n matrix. Then let v1 be a unit eigenvector
for A . Then there exists λ1 such that
Av1 = λ1 v1 , |v1 | = 1.
Extend {v1 } to a basis and then use Lemma 7.4.1 to obtain {v1 , · · · , vn }, an orthonormal
basis in Fn . Let U0 be a matrix whose ith column is vi . Then from the above, it follows U0
is unitary. Then U0∗ AU0 is of the form

polynomials and since the eigenvalues of T are the diagonal entries listed according to
algebraic multiplicity, 

From the above formula, the eigenvalues of A consist of the eigenvalues of the upper triangular matrices Tk , and each Tk has the same eigenvalues as Pk . 
What if A is a real matrix and you only want to consider real unitary matrices?
Theorem 7.4.6 Let A be a real n × n matrix. Then
and a matrix T of the form

where Pi equals either a real 1 × 1 matrix or Pi equals a real 2 × 2 matrix having as its
eigenvalues a conjugate pair of eigenvalues of A such that QT AQ = T. The matrix T is
called the real Schur form of the matrix A. Recall that a real unitary matrix is also called
an orthogonal matrix.
Proof: Suppose
Av1 = λ1 v1 , |v1 | = 1
where λ1 is real. Then let {v1 , · · · , vn } be an orthonormal basis of vectors in Rn . Let Q0
be a matrix whose ith column is vi . Then Q∗0 AQ0 is of the form

where A1 is a real n − 1 × n − 1 matrix. This is just like the proof of Theorem 7.4.4 up to
this point.
Now consider the case where λ1 = α + iβ where β ̸= 0. It follows since A is real that
v1 = z1 + iw1 and that v1 = z1 − iw1 is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue α − iβ. Here
z1 and w1 are real vectors. Since v1 and v1 are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct
eigenvalues, they form a linearly independent set. From this it follows that {z1 , w1 } is an

independent set of vectors in Cn , hence in Rn . Indeed,{v1 , v1 } is an independent set and
also span (v1 , v1 ) = span (z1 , w1 ) . Now using the Gram Schmidt theorem in Rn , there exists
{u1 , u2 } , an orthonormal set of real vectors such that span (u1 , u2 ) = span (v1 , v1 ). For
example,
2
|z1 | w1 − (w1 · z1 ) z1
u1 = z1 / |z1 | , u2 =
2
|z1 | w1 − (w1 · z1 ) z1
Let {u1 , u2 , · · · , un } be an orthonormal basis in Rn and let Q0 be a unitary matrix whose
ith column is ui so Q0 is a real orthogonal matrix. Then Auj are both in span (u1 , u2 ) for
j = 1, 2 and so uTk Auj = 0 whenever k ≥ 3. It follows that Q∗0 AQ0 is of the form

where A1 is now an n − 2 × n − 2 matrix and P1 is a 2 × 2 matrix. Now this is similar to A

thus putting a 2×2 identity matrix in the upper left corner rather than a one. Repeating this
process with the above modiﬁcation for the case of a complex eigenvalue leads eventually
to (7.12) where Q is the product of real unitary matrices Qi above. When the block Pi is
2 × 2, its eigenvalues are a conjugate pair of eigenvalues of A and if it is 1 × 1 it is a real
eigenvalue of A.
Here is why this last claim is true

where Ik is the 2 × 2 identity matrix in the case that Pk is 2 × 2 and is the number 1 in the
case where Pk is a 1 × 1 matrix. Now by Lemma 7.4.5,
det (λI − T ) =

r
∏

det (λIk − Pk ) .

k=1

Therefore, λ is an eigenvalue of T if and only if it is an eigenvalue of some Pk . This proves
the theorem since the eigenvalues of T are the same as those of A including multiplicity
because they have the same characteristic polynomial due to the similarity of A and T. 
Corollary 7.4.7 Let A be a real n × n matrix having only real eigenvalues. Then there
exists a real orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix T such that
QT AQ = T

and furthermore, if the eigenvalues of A are listed in decreasing order,
λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn
Q can be chosen such that T is of the form

Proof: Most of this follows right away from Theorem 7.4.6. It remains to verify the
claim that the diagonal entries can be arranged in the desired order. However, this follows
from a simple modiﬁcation of the above argument. When you ﬁnd v1 the eigenvalue of λ1 ,
just be sure λ1 is chosen to be the largest eigenvalue. Then observe that from Lemma 7.4.5
applied to the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues of the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix A1
are {λ1 , · · · , λn }. Then pick λ2 to continue the process of construction with A1 . 
Of course there is a similar conclusion which can be proved exactly the same way in the
case where A has complex eigenvalues.
Corollary 7.4.8 Let A be a real n × n matrix. Then there exists a real orthogonal matrix
Q and an upper triangular matrix T such that

where Pi equals either a real 1 × 1 matrix or Pi equals a real 2 × 2 matrix having as its
eigenvalues a conjugate pair of eigenvalues of A. If Pk corresponds to the two eigenvalues
αk ± iβ k ≡ σ (Pk ) , Q can be chosen such that
|σ (P1 )| ≥ |σ (P2 )| ≥ · · ·
where
|σ (Pk )| ≡

√
α2k + β 2k

The blocks, Pk can be arranged in any other order also.
Deﬁnition 7.4.9 When a linear transformation, A, mapping a linear space, V to V has a
basis of eigenvectors, the linear transformation is called non defective. Otherwise it is called
defective. An n × n matrix A, is called normal if AA∗ = A∗ A. An important class of normal
matrices is that of the Hermitian or self adjoint matrices. An n × n matrix A is self adjoint
or Hermitian if A = A∗ .
The next lemma is the basis for concluding that every normal matrix is unitarily similar
to a diagonal matrix.
Lemma 7.4.10 If T is upper triangular and normal, then T is a diagonal matrix.
Proof:This is obviously true if T is 1 × 1. In fact, it can’t help being diagonal in this
case. Suppose then that the lemma is true for (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrices and let T be an
upper triangular normal n × n matrix. Thus T is of the form

Now here is a proof which doesn’t involve block multiplication. Since T is normal,
T ∗ T = T T ∗ . Writing this in terms of components and using the description of the adjoint

Theorem 7.4.11 Let A be a normal matrix. Then there exists a unitary matrix U such
that U ∗ AU is a diagonal matrix.

7.4. SCHUR’S THEOREM

179

Proof: From Theorem 7.4.4 there exists a unitary matrix U such that U ∗ AU equals
an upper triangular matrix. The theorem is now proved if it is shown that the property of
being normal is preserved under unitary similarity transformations. That is, verify that if
A is normal and if B = U ∗ AU, then B is also normal. But this is easy.
B∗B

= U ∗ A∗ U U ∗ AU = U ∗ A∗ AU
= U ∗ AA∗ U = U ∗ AU U ∗ A∗ U = BB ∗ .

Therefore, U ∗ AU is a normal and upper triangular matrix and by Lemma 7.4.10 it must be
a diagonal matrix. 
Corollary 7.4.12 If A is Hermitian, then all the eigenvalues of A are real and there exists
an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.
Proof: Since A is normal, there exists unitary, U such that U ∗ AU = D, a diagonal
matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of A. Therefore, D∗ = U ∗ A∗ U = U ∗ AU =
D showing D is real.
Finally, let
(
)
U = u1 u2 · · · un
where the ui denote the columns of U and

λ1

D=
0
The equation, U ∗ AU = D implies

)

where the entries denote the columns of AU and U D respectively. Therefore, Aui = λi ui
and since the matrix is unitary, the ij th entry of U ∗ U equals δ ij and so
δ ij = u∗i uj ≡ uj · ui .
This proves the corollary because it shows the vectors {ui } are orthonormal. Therefore,
they form a basis because every orthonormal set of vectors is linearly independent. 
Corollary 7.4.13 If A is a real symmetric matrix, then A is Hermitian and there exists a
real unitary matrix U such that U T AU = D where D is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal
entries are the eigenvalues of A. By arranging the columns of U the diagonal entries of D
can be made to appear in any order.
Proof: This follows from Theorem 7.4.6 and Corollary 7.4.12. Let
(
)
U = u1 · · · un
Then AU = U D so

AU = Au1

Hence each column of U is an eigenvector of A. It follows that by rearranging these columns,
the entries of D on the main diagonal can be made to appear in any order. To see this,
consider such a rearrangement resulting in an orthogonal matrix U ′ given by
(

U ′ = ui1 · · · uin

A, B are similar, then
(

(

det (A) = det S −1 det (S) det (B) = det S −1 S det (B)

The trace is deﬁned in the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 7.5.1 Let A be an n × n matrix whose ij th entry is denoted as aij . Then
∑
trace (A) ≡

i

In other words it is the sum of the entries down the main diagonal.
With this deﬁnition, it is easy to see that if A = S −1 BS, then
trace (A) = trace (B) .
Here is why.

Theorem 7.5.2 Let A be an n×n matrix. Then trace (A) equals the sum of the eigenvalues
of A and det (A) equals the product of the eigenvalues of A.
This is proved using Schur’s theorem and is in Problem 17 below. Another important
property of the trace is in the following theorem.

7.6. QUADRATIC FORMS

Quadratic Forms

Deﬁnition 7.6.1 A quadratic form in three dimensions is an expression of the form


x
(
)
x y z A y 
(7.13)
z
where A is a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix. In higher dimensions the idea is the same except you
use a larger symmetric matrix in place of A. In two dimensions A is a 2 × 2 matrix.
For example, consider
(

x

y

z

)



3 −4
 −4 0
1 −4



1
x
−4   y 
3
z

(7.14)

which equals 3x2 − 8xy + 2xz − 8yz + 3z 2 . This is very awkward because of the mixed terms
such as −8xy. The idea is to pick diﬀerent axes such that if x, y, z are taken with respect
to these axes, the quadratic form is much simpler. In other words, look for new variables,
x′ , y ′ , and z ′ and a unitary matrix U such that
 ′  

x
x
U  y′  =  y 
(7.15)
z′
z
and if you write the quadratic form in terms of the primed variables, there will be no mixed
terms. Any symmetric real matrix is Hermitian and is therefore normal. From Corollary
7.4.13, it follows there exists a real unitary matrix U, (an orthogonal matrix) such that
U T AU = D a diagonal matrix. Thus in the quadratic form, (7.13)


Second Derivative Test

Under certain conditions the mixed partial derivatives will always be equal. This astonishing fact was ﬁrst observed by Euler around 1734. It is also called Clairaut’s theorem.
Theorem 7.7.1 Suppose f : U ⊆ F2 → R where U is an open set on which fx , fy , fxy and
fyx exist. Then if fxy and fyx are continuous at the point (x, y) ∈ U , it follows
fxy (x, y) = fyx (x, y) .
Proof: Since U is open, there exists r > 0 such that B ((x, y) , r) ⊆ U. Now let |t| , |s| <
r/2, t, s real numbers and consider

As implied above, h (t) ≡ f (x + t, y + s)−f (x + t, y). Therefore, by the mean value theorem

for some α ∈ (0, 1) . Applying the mean value theorem again,
∆ (s, t) = fxy (x + αt, y + βs)
where α, β ∈ (0, 1).
If the terms f (x + t, y) and f (x, y + s) are interchanged in (7.16), ∆ (s, t) is unchanged
and the above argument shows there exist γ, δ ∈ (0, 1) such that
∆ (s, t) = fyx (x + γt, y + δs) .
Letting (s, t) → (0, 0) and using the continuity of fxy and fyx at (x, y) ,
lim
(s,t)→(0,0)

∆ (s, t) = fxy (x, y) = fyx (x, y) . 

The following is obtained from the above by simply ﬁxing all the variables except for the
two of interest.

7.7. SECOND DERIVATIVE TEST

183

Corollary 7.7.2 Suppose U is an open subset of Fn and f : U → R has the property
that for two indices, k, l, fxk , fxl , fxl xk , and fxk xl exist on U and fxk xl and fxl xk are both
continuous at x ∈ U. Then fxk xl (x) = fxl xk (x) .
Thus the theorem asserts that the mixed partial derivatives are equal at x if they are
deﬁned near x and continuous at x.
Now recall the Taylor formula with the Lagrange form of the remainder. What follows
is a proof of this important result based on the mean value theorem or Rolle’s theorem.
Theorem 7.7.3 Suppose f has n + 1 derivatives on an interval, (a, b) and let c ∈ (a, b) .
Then if x ∈ (a, b) , there exists ξ between c and x such that
f (x) = f (c) +

ak will denote the number 0.)

Proof: If n = 0 then the theorem is true because it is just the mean value theorem.
Suppose the theorem is true for n − 1, n ≥ 1. It can be assumed x ̸= c because if x = c there
is nothing to show. Then there exists K such that
(

Now deﬁne F (t) for t in the closed interval determined by x and c by

F (t) ≡ f (x) − f (t) +

The c in (7.17) got replaced by t.

Theorem 7.7.7 In the above situation, suppose fxj (x) = 0 for each xj . Then if H (x) has
all positive eigenvalues, x is a local minimum for f . If H (x) has all negative eigenvalues,
then x is a local maximum. If H (x) has a positive eigenvalue, then there exists a direction
in which f has a local minimum at x, while if H (x) has a negative eigenvalue, there exists
a direction in which H (x) has a local maximum at x.
Proof: Since fxj (x) = 0 for each xj , formula (7.19) implies

whenever t is small enough. Thus in the direction v the function has a local minimum at
x. The assertion about the local maximum in some direction follows similarly. 
This theorem is an analogue of the second derivative test for higher dimensions. As in
one dimension, when there is a zero eigenvalue, it may be impossible to determine from the
Hessian matrix what the local qualitative behavior of the function is. For example, consider
f1 (x, y) = x4 + y 2 , f2 (x, y) = −x4 + y 2 .
Then Dfi (0, 0) = 0 and for both functions, the Hessian matrix evaluated at (0, 0) equals

but the behavior of the two functions is very diﬀerent near the origin. The second has a
saddle point while the ﬁrst has a minimum there.

The Estimation Of Eigenvalues

There are ways to estimate the eigenvalues for matrices. The most famous is known as
Gerschgorin’s theorem. This theorem gives a rough idea where the eigenvalues are just from
looking at the matrix.
Theorem 7.8.1 Let A be an n × n matrix. Consider the n Gerschgorin discs deﬁned as




∑
Di ≡ λ ∈ C : |λ − aii | ≤
|aij | .


j̸=i

Then every eigenvalue is contained in some Gerschgorin disc.
This theorem says to add up the absolute values of the entries of the ith row which are
oﬀ the main diagonal and form the disc centered at aii having this radius. The union of
these discs contains σ (A) .
Proof: Suppose Ax = λx where x ̸= 0. Then for A = (aij )
∑
aij xj = (λ − aii ) xi .
j̸=i

Therefore, picking k such that |xk | ≥ |xj | for all xj , it follows that |xk | ̸= 0 since |x| ̸= 0
and
∑
∑
|xk |
|aij | ≥
|aij | |xj | ≥ |λ − aii | |xk | .
j̸=i

j̸=i

Now dividing by |xk |, it follows λ is contained in the k th Gerschgorin disc. 
Example 7.8.2 Here is a matrix. Estimate its


eigenvalues.


9

According to Gerschgorin’s theorem the eigenvalues are contained in the disks
D1 = {λ ∈ C : |λ − 2| ≤ 2} , D2 = {λ ∈ C : |λ − 5| ≤ 3} ,
D3 = {λ ∈ C : |λ − 9| ≤ 1}
It is important to observe that these disks are in the complex plane. In general this is the
case. If you want to ﬁnd eigenvalues they will be complex numbers.

So what are the values of the eigenvalues? In this case they are real. You can compute
them by graphing the characteristic polynomial, λ3 − 16λ2 + 70λ − 66 and then zooming in on the zeros. If you do this you ﬁnd the solution is {λ = 1. 295 3} , {λ = 5. 590 5} ,
{λ = 9. 114 2} . Of course these are only approximations and so this information is useless

for ﬁnding eigenvectors. However, in many applications, it is the size of the eigenvalues
which is important and so these numerical values would be helpful for such applications. In
this case, you might think there is no real reason for Gerschgorin’s theorem. Why not just
compute the characteristic equation and graph and zoom? This is ﬁne up to a point, but
what if the matrix was huge? Then it might be hard to ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial.
Remember the diﬃculties in expanding a big matrix along a row or column. Also, what if
the eigenvalues were complex? You don’t see these by following this procedure. However,
Gerschgorin’s theorem will at least estimate them.

Advanced Theorems

More can be said but this requires some theory from complex variables1 . The following is a
fundamental theorem about counting zeros.
Theorem 7.9.1 Let U be a region and let γ : [a, b] → U be closed, continuous, bounded
variation, and the winding number, n (γ, z) = 0 for all z ∈
/ U. Suppose also that f is
analytic on U having zeros a1 , · · · , am where the zeros are repeated according to multiplicity,
and suppose that none of these zeros are on γ ([a, b]) . Then

Now let A be an n × n matrix. Recall that the eigenvalues of A are given by the zeros
of the polynomial, pA (z) = det (zI − A) where I is the n × n identity. You can argue
that small changes in A will produce small changes in pA (z) and p′A (z) . Let γ k denote a
very small closed circle which winds around zk , one of the eigenvalues of A, in the counter
clockwise direction so that n (γ k , zk ) = 1. This circle is to enclose only zk and is to have no
other eigenvalue on it. Then apply Theorem 7.9.1. According to this theorem
∫ ′
1
pA (z)
dz
2πi γ pA (z)
is always an integer equal to the multiplicity of zk as a root of pA (t) . Therefore, small
changes in A result in no change to the above contour integral because it must be an integer
and small changes in A result in small changes in the integral. Therefore whenever B is close
enough to A, the two matrices have the same number of zeros inside γ k , the zeros being
counted according to multiplicity. By making the radius of the small circle equal to ε where
ε is less than the minimum distance between any two distinct eigenvalues of A, this shows
that if B is close enough to A, every eigenvalue of B is closer than ε to some eigenvalue of
A. 

Theorem 7.9.2 If λ is an eigenvalue of A, then if all the entries of B are close enough to
the corresponding entries of A, some eigenvalue of B will be within ε of λ.
Consider the situation that A (t) is an n × n matrix and that t → A (t) is continuous for
t ∈ [0, 1] .
Lemma 7.9.3 Let λ (t) ∈ σ (A (t)) for t < 1 and let Σt = ∪s≥t σ (A (s)) . Also let Kt be the
connected component of λ (t) in Σt . Then there exists η > 0 such that Kt ∩ σ (A (s)) ̸= ∅ for
all s ∈ [t, t + η] .
Proof: Denote by D (λ (t) , δ) the disc centered at λ (t) having radius δ > 0, with other
occurrences of this notation being deﬁned similarly. Thus
D (λ (t) , δ) ≡ {z ∈ C : |λ (t) − z| ≤ δ} .
Suppose δ > 0 is small enough that λ (t) is the only element of σ (A (t)) contained in
D (λ (t) , δ) and that pA(t) has no zeroes on the boundary of this disc. Then by continuity, and
the above discussion and theorem, there exists η > 0, t + η < 1, such that for s ∈ [t, t + η] ,
pA(s) also has no zeroes on the boundary of this disc and A (s) has the same number
of eigenvalues, counted according to multiplicity, in the disc as A (t) . Thus σ (A (s)) ∩
D (λ (t) , δ) ̸= ∅ for all s ∈ [t, t + η] . Now let
∪
H=
σ (A (s)) ∩ D (λ (t) , δ) .
s∈[t,t+η]

It will be shown that H is connected. Suppose not. Then H = P ∪ Q where P, Q are
separated and λ (t) ∈ P. Let s0 ≡ inf {s : λ (s) ∈ Q for some λ (s) ∈ σ (A (s))} . There exists
λ (s0 ) ∈ σ (A (s0 )) ∩ D (λ (t) , δ) . If λ (s0 ) ∈
/ Q, then from the above discussion there are
λ (s) ∈ σ (A (s)) ∩ Q for s > s0 arbitrarily close to λ (s0 ) . Therefore, λ (s0 ) ∈ Q which shows
that s0 > t because λ (t) is the only element of σ (A (t)) in D (λ (t) , δ) and λ (t) ∈ P. Now
let sn ↑ s0 . Then λ (sn ) ∈ P for any λ (sn ) ∈ σ (A (sn )) ∩ D (λ (t) , δ) and also it follows from
the above discussion that for some choice of sn → s0 , λ (sn ) → λ (s0 ) which contradicts P
and Q separated and nonempty. Since P is nonempty, this shows Q = ∅. Therefore, H is
connected as claimed. But Kt ⊇ H and so Kt ∩ σ (A (s)) ̸= ∅ for all s ∈ [t, t + η] . 
Theorem 7.9.4 Suppose A (t) is an n × n matrix and that t → A (t) is continuous for
t ∈ [0, 1] . Let λ (0) ∈ σ (A (0)) and deﬁne Σ ≡ ∪t∈[0,1] σ (A (t)) . Let Kλ(0) = K0 denote the
connected component of λ (0) in Σ. Then K0 ∩ σ (A (t)) ̸= ∅ for all t ∈ [0, 1] .
Proof: Let S ≡ {t ∈ [0, 1] : K0 ∩ σ (A (s)) ̸= ∅ for all s ∈ [0, t]} . Then 0 ∈ S. Let t0 =
sup (S) . Say σ (A (t0 )) = λ1 (t0 ) , · · · , λr (t0 ) .
Claim: At least one of these is a limit point of K0 and consequently must be in K0
which shows that S has a last point. Why is this claim true? Let sn ↑ t0 so sn ∈ S.
Now let the discs, D (λi (t0 ) , δ) , i = 1, · · · , r be disjoint with pA(t0 ) having no zeroes on γ i
the boundary of D (λi (t0 ) , δ) . Then for n large enough it follows from Theorem 7.9.1 and
the discussion following it that σ (A (sn )) is contained in ∪ri=1 D (λi (t0 ) , δ). It follows that
K0 ∩ (σ (A (t0 )) + D (0, δ)) ̸= ∅ for all δ small enough. This requires at least one of the
λi (t0 ) to be in K0 . Therefore, t0 ∈ S and S has a last point.
Now by Lemma 7.9.3, if t0 < 1, then K0 ∪ Kt would be a strictly larger connected set
containing λ (0) . (The reason this would be strictly larger is that K0 ∩ σ (A (s)) = ∅ for
some s ∈ (t, t + η) while Kt ∩ σ (A (s)) ̸= ∅ for all s ∈ [t, t + η].) Therefore, t0 = 1. 
Corollary 7.9.5 Suppose one of the Gerschgorin discs, Di is disjoint from the union of
the others. Then Di contains an eigenvalue of A. Also, if there are n disjoint Gerschgorin
discs, then each one contains an eigenvalue of A.

( )
Proof: Denote by A (t) the matrix atij where if i ̸= j, atij = taij and atii = aii . Thus to
get A (t) multiply all non diagonal terms by t. Let t ∈ [0, 1] . Then A (0) = diag (a11 , · · · , ann )
and A (1) = A. Furthermore, the map, t → A (t) is continuous. Denote by Djt the Gerschgorin disc obtained from the j th row for the matrix A (t). Then it is clear that Djt ⊆ Dj
the j th Gerschgorin disc for A. It follows aii is the eigenvalue for A (0) which is contained
in the disc, consisting of the single point aii which is contained in Di . Letting K be the
connected component in Σ for Σ deﬁned in Theorem 7.9.4 which is determined by aii , Gerschgorin’s theorem implies that K ∩ σ (A (t)) ⊆ ∪nj=1 Djt ⊆ ∪nj=1 Dj = Di ∪ (∪j̸=i Dj ) and
also, since K is connected, there are not points of K in both Di and (∪j̸=i Dj ) . Since at least
one point of K is in Di ,(aii ), it follows all of K must be contained in Di . Now by Theorem
7.9.4 this shows there are points of K ∩ σ (A) in Di . The last assertion follows immediately.

This can be improved even more. This involves the following lemma.
Lemma 7.9.6 In the situation of Theorem 7.9.4 suppose λ (0) = K0 ∩ σ (A (0)) and that
λ (0) is a simple root of the characteristic equation of A (0). Then for all t ∈ [0, 1] ,
σ (A (t)) ∩ K0 = λ (t)
where λ (t) is a simple root of the characteristic equation of A (t) .
Proof: Let S ≡ {t ∈ [0, 1] : K0 ∩ σ (A (s)) = λ (s) , a simple eigenvalue for all s ∈ [0, t]} .
Then 0 ∈ S so it is nonempty. Let t0 = sup (S) and suppose λ1 ̸= λ2 are two elements of
σ (A (t0 ))∩K0 . Then choosing η > 0 small enough, and letting Di be disjoint discs containing
λi respectively, similar arguments to those of Lemma 7.9.3 can be used to conclude
Hi ≡ ∪s∈[t0 −η,t0 ] σ (A (s)) ∩ Di
is a connected and nonempty set for i = 1, 2 which would require that Hi ⊆ K0 . But
then there would be two diﬀerent eigenvalues of A (s) contained in K0 , contrary to the
deﬁnition of t0 . Therefore, there is at most one eigenvalue λ (t0 ) ∈ K0 ∩ σ (A (t0 )) . Could
it be a repeated root of the characteristic equation? Suppose λ (t0 ) is a repeated root of
the characteristic equation. As before, choose a small disc, D centered at λ (t0 ) and η small
enough that
H ≡ ∪s∈[t0 −η,t0 ] σ (A (s)) ∩ D
is a nonempty connected set containing either multiple eigenvalues of A (s) or else a single
repeated root to the characteristic equation of A (s) . But since H is connected and contains
λ (t0 ) it must be contained in K0 which contradicts the condition for s ∈ S for all these
s ∈ [t0 − η, t0 ] . Therefore, t0 ∈ S as hoped. If t0 < 1, there exists a small disc centered
at λ (t0 ) and η > 0 such that for all s ∈ [t0 , t0 + η] , A (s) has only simple eigenvalues in
D and the only eigenvalues of A (s) which could be in K0 are in D. (This last assertion
follows from noting that λ (t0 ) is the only eigenvalue of A (t0 ) in K0 and so the others are
at a positive distance from K0 . For s close enough to t0 , the eigenvalues of A (s) are either
close to these eigenvalues of A (t0 ) at a positive distance from K0 or they are close to the
eigenvalue λ (t0 ) in which case it can be assumed they are in D.) But this shows that t0 is
not really an upper bound to S. Therefore, t0 = 1 and the lemma is proved. 
With this lemma, the conclusion of the above corollary can be sharpened.
Corollary 7.9.7 Suppose one of the Gerschgorin discs, Di is disjoint from the union of
the others. Then Di contains exactly one eigenvalue of A and this eigenvalue is a simple
root to the characteristic polynomial of A.

Proof: In the proof of Corollary 7.9.5, note that aii is a simple root of A (0) since
otherwise the ith Gerschgorin disc would not be disjoint from the others. Also, K, the
connected component determined by aii must be contained in Di because it is connected
and by Gerschgorin’s theorem above, K ∩ σ (A (t)) must be contained in the union of the
Gerschgorin discs. Since all the other eigenvalues of A (0) , the ajj , are outside Di , it follows
that K ∩ σ (A (0)) = aii . Therefore, by Lemma 7.9.6, K ∩ σ (A (1)) = K ∩ σ (A) consists of
a single simple eigenvalue. 

eigenvalues are not easy to ﬁnd. They are the roots of the characteristic equation, t3 − 6t2 +
3t + 5 = 0. The numerical values of these are −. 669 66, 1. 423 1, and 5. 246 55, verifying the

1. Explain why it is typically impossible to compute the upper triangular matrix whose
existence is guaranteed by Schur’s theorem.
2. Now recall the QR factorization of Theorem 5.7.5 on Page 133. The QR algorithm
is a technique which does compute the upper triangular matrix in Schur’s theorem.
There is much more to the QR algorithm than will be presented here. In fact, what
I am about to show you is not the way it is done in practice. One ﬁrst obtains what
is called a Hessenburg matrix for which the algorithm will work better. However,
the idea is as follows. Start with A an n × n matrix having real eigenvalues. Form
A = QR where Q is orthogonal and R is upper triangular. (Right triangular.) This
can be done using the technique of Theorem 5.7.5 using Householder matrices. Next
take A1 ≡ RQ. Show that A = QA1 QT . In other words these two matrices, A, A1 are
similar. Explain why they have the same eigenvalues. Continue by letting A1 play the
role of A. Thus the algorithm is of the form An = QRn and An+1 = Rn+1 Q. Explain
why A = Qn An QTn for some Qn orthogonal. Thus An is a sequence of matrices each
similar to A. The remarkable thing is that often these matrices converge to an upper
triangular matrix T and A = QT QT for some orthogonal matrix, the limit of the Qn
where the limit means the entries converge. Then the process computes the upper
triangular Schur form of the matrix A. Thus the eigenvalues of A appear on the
diagonal of T. You will see approximately what these are as the process continues.

37. This and the following problems will present most of a diﬀerential equations course.
Most of the explanations are given. You ﬁll in any details needed. To begin with,
consider the scalar initial value problem
y ′ = ay, y (t0 ) = y0
When a is real, show the unique solution to this problem is y = y0 ea(t−t0 ) . Next
suppose
y ′ = (a + ib) y, y (t0 ) = y0
(7.20)
where y (t) = u (t) + iv (t) . Show there exists a unique solution and it is given by
y (t) =
y0 ea(t−t0 ) (cos b (t − t0 ) + i sin b (t − t0 )) ≡ e(a+ib)(t−t0 ) y0 .
(7.21)
Next show that for a real or complex there exists a unique solution to the initial value
problem
y ′ = ay + f, y (t0 ) = y0
and it is given by

SPECTRAL THEORY

Now you ﬁnish the argument. To show uniqueness in the second part, suppose
y ′ = (a + ib) y, y (t0 ) = 0
and verify this requires y (t) = 0. To do this, note
y ′ = (a − ib) y, y (t0 ) = 0
2

and that |y| (t0 ) = 0 and
d
2
|y (t)| = y ′ (t) y (t) + y ′ (t) y (t)
dt
2

= (a + ib) y (t) y (t) + (a − ib) y (t) y (t) = 2a |y (t)| .
Thus from the ﬁrst part |y (t)| = 0e−2at = 0. Finally observe by a simple computation
that (7.20) is solved by (7.21). For the last part, write the equation as
2

y ′ − ay = f
and multiply both sides by e−at and then integrate from t0 to t using the initial
condition.
38. Now consider A an n × n matrix. By Schur’s theorem there exists unitary Q such that
Q−1 AQ = T
where T is upper triangular. Now consider the ﬁrst order initial value problem
x′ = Ax, x (t0 ) = x0 .
Show there exists a unique solution to this ﬁrst order system. Hint: Let y = Q−1 x
and so the system becomes
y′ = T y, y (t0 ) = Q−1 x0

(7.22)

T

Now letting y = (y1 , · · · , yn ) , the bottom equation becomes
(
)
yn′ = tnn yn , yn (t0 ) = Q−1 x0 n .
Then use the solution you get in this to get the solution to the initial value problem
which occurs one level up, namely
(

Continue doing this to obtain a unique solution to (7.22).

40. In the above problem, consider the question whether all solutions to
x′ = Ax

(7.24)

are obtained in the form Φ (t) c for some choice of c ∈ Fn . In other words, is the
general solution to this equation Φ (t) c for c ∈ Fn ? Prove the following theorem using
linear algebra.
Theorem 7.10.1 Suppose Φ (t) is an n × n matrix which satisﬁes Φ′ (t) = AΦ (t) .

Then the general solution to (7.24) is Φ (t) c if and only if Φ (t) exists for some t.

Furthermore, if Φ (t) = AΦ (t) , then either Φ (t) exists for all t or Φ (t) never
exists for any t.
(det (Φ (t)) is called the Wronskian and this theorem is sometimes called the Wronskian
alternative.)
Hint: Suppose ﬁrst the general solution is of the form Φ (t) c where c is an arbitrary
−1
constant vector in Fn . You need to verify Φ (t)
exists for some t. In fact, show
−1
−1
Φ (t) exists for every t. Suppose then that Φ (t0 ) does not exist. Explain why
n
there exists c ∈ F such that there is no solution x to the equation c = Φ (t0 ) x. By
the existence part of Problem 38 there exists a solution to
x′ = Ax, x (t0 ) = c
−1

but this cannot be in the form Φ (t) c. Thus for every t, Φ (t) exists. Next suppose
−1
for some t0 , Φ (t0 ) exists. Let z′ = Az and choose c such that
z (t0 ) = Φ (t0 ) c
Then both z (t) , Φ (t) c solve
x′ = Ax, x (t0 ) = z (t0 )
Apply uniqueness to conclude z = Φ (t) c. Finally, consider that Φ (t) c for c ∈ Fn
−1
either is the general solution or it is not the general solution. If it is, then Φ (t)
−1
exists for all t. If it is not, then Φ (t) cannot exist for any t from what was just
shown.
41. Let Φ′ (t) = AΦ (t) . Then Φ (t) is called a fundamental matrix if Φ (t)
t. Show there exists a unique solution to the equation

Now these few problems have done virtually everything of signiﬁcance in an entire undergraduate diﬀerential equations course, illustrating the superiority of linear algebra.
The above formula is called the variation of constants formula.
Hint: Uniquenss is easy. If x1 , x2 are two solutions then let u (t) = x1 (t) − x2 (t) and
argue u′ = Au, u (t0 ) = 0. Then use Problem 38. To verify there exists a solution, you

could just diﬀerentiate the above formula using the fundamental theorem of calculus
and verify it works. Another way is to assume the solution in the form
x (t) = Φ (t) c (t)
and ﬁnd c (t) to make it all work out. This is called the method of variation of
parameters.
42. Show there exists a special Φ such that Φ′ (t) = AΦ (t) , Φ (0) = I, and suppose

Φ (t) exists for all t. Show using uniqueness that

and that for all t, s ∈ R

Hint: Let Φ (t) be such that the j th column is xj (t) where

Use uniqueness as required.
43. You can see more on this problem and the next one in the latest version of Horn
and Johnson, [16]. Two n × n matrices A, B are said to be congruent if there is an
invertible P such that
B = P AP ∗
Let A be a Hermitian matrix. Thus it has all real eigenvalues. Let n+ be the number
of positive eigenvalues, n− , the number of negative eigenvalues and n0 the number of

Ok the k × k zero matrix. Then the inertia matrix of A is the following block diagonal
n × n matrix.

Show that A is congruent to its inertia matrix. Next show that congruence is an

44. Show that if A, B are two congruent Hermitian matrices, then they have the same
inertia matrix. Hint: Let A = SBS ∗ where S is invertible. Show that A, B have the
same rank and this implies that they are each unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix
which has the same number of zero entries on the main diagonal. Therefore, letting
VA be the span of the eigenvectors associated with positive eigenvalues of A and VB
being deﬁned similarly, it suﬃces to show that these have the same dimensions. Show
that (Ax, x) > 0 for all x ∈ VA . Next consider S ∗ VA . For x ∈ VA , explain why

(BS ∗ x,S ∗ x) =

)
(
) (
(

= S −1 Ax,S ∗ x = Ax, S −1 S ∗ x = (Ax, x) > 0
Next explain why this shows that S ∗ VA is a subspace of VB and so the dimension of VB
is at least as large as the dimension of VA . Hence there are at least as many positive
eigenvalues for B as there are for A. Switching A, B you can turn the inequality
around. Thus the two have the same inertia matrix.
45. Let A be an m × n matrix. Then if you unraveled it, you could consider it as a vector
in Cnm . The Frobenius inner product on the vector space of m × n matrices is deﬁned
as
(A, B) ≡ trace (AB ∗ )
Show that this really does satisfy the axioms of an inner product space and that it
also amounts to nothing more than considering m × n matrices as vectors in Cnm .
46. ↑Consider the n × n unitary matrices. Show that whenever U is such a matrix, it
follows that
√
|U |Cnn = n
Next explain why if {Uk } is any sequence of unitary matrices, there exists a subse∞
quence {Ukm }m=1 such that limm→∞ Ukm = U where U is unitary. Here the limit
takes place in the sense that the entries of Ukm converge to the corresponding entries
of U .

dist (σ (A) , σ (B)) = max min {|λ − µ| : µ ∈ σ (B)}
λ∈σ(A)

Explain why dist (σ (A) , σ (B)) is small if and only if every eigenvalue of A is close
to some eigenvalue of B. Now prove the following theorem using the above problem
and Schur’s theorem. This theorem says roughly that if A is close to B then the
eigenvalues of A are close to those of B in the sense that every eigenvalue of A is close
to an eigenvalue of B.

Page 122 to argue that you can say that a given matrix is similar to one which has
the diagonal entries permuted in any order desired. Then use the above problem and
block multiplication to show that if the A has k nonzero entries, then it is similar to
a matrix which has k − 1 nonzero entries. Finally, when A is similar to one which has
at most one nonzero entry, this one must also be zero because of the condition on the

Vector Spaces And Fields
8.1

Vector Space Axioms

It is time to consider the idea of a Vector space.
Deﬁnition 8.1.1 A vector space is an Abelian group of “vectors” satisfying the axioms of
an Abelian group,
v + w = w + v,
the commutative law of addition,
(v + w) + z = v+ (w + z) ,
the associative law for addition,
v + 0 = v,
the existence of an additive identity,
v+ (−v) = 0,
the existence of an additive inverse, along with a ﬁeld of “scalars”, F which are allowed to
multiply the vectors according to the following rules. (The Greek letters denote scalars.)
α (v + w) = αv+αw,

(8.1)

(α + β) v =αv+βv,

(8.2)

α (βv) = αβ (v) ,

(8.3)

1v = v.

(8.4)

The ﬁeld of scalars is usually R or C and the vector space will be called real or complex
depending on whether the ﬁeld is R or C. However, other ﬁelds are also possible. For
example, one could use the ﬁeld of rational numbers or even the ﬁeld of the integers mod p
for p a prime. A vector space is also called a linear space.
For example, Rn with the usual conventions is an example of a real vector space and Cn
is an example of a complex vector space. Up to now, the discussion has been for Rn or Cn
and all that is taking place is an increase in generality and abstraction.
There are many examples of vector spaces.

VECTOR SPACES AND FIELDS

Example 8.1.2 Let Ω be a nonempty set and let V consist of all functions deﬁned on Ω
which have values in some ﬁeld F. The vector operations are deﬁned as follows.
(f + g) (x)
(αf ) (x)

=
=

f (x) + g (x)
αf (x)

Then it is routine to verify that V with these operations is a vector space.
Note that Fn actually ﬁts in to this framework. You consider the set Ω to be {1, 2, · · · , n}
and then the mappings from Ω to F give the elements of Fn . Thus a typical vector can be
considered as a function.
Example 8.1.3 Generalize the above example by letting V denote all functions deﬁned on
Ω which have values in a vector space W which has ﬁeld of scalars F. The deﬁnitions of
scalar multiplication and vector addition are identical to those of the above example.

Subspaces And Bases
Basic Deﬁnitions

{ n
}
∑
α i vi : α i ∈ F .
span (v1 , · · · , vn ) ≡
i=1

A subset, W ⊆ V is said to be a subspace if it is also a vector space with the same ﬁeld of
scalars. Thus W ⊆ V is a subspace if ax + by ∈ W whenever a, b ∈ F and x, y ∈ W. The
span of a set of vectors as just described is an example of a subspace.
Example 8.2.2 Consider the real valued functions deﬁned on an interval [a, b]. A subspace
is the set of continuous real valued functions deﬁned on the interval. Another subspace is
the set of polynomials of degree no more than 4.
Deﬁnition 8.2.3 If {v1 , · · · , vn } ⊆ V, the set of vectors is linearly independent if
n
∑

α i vi = 0

i=1

implies
α1 = · · · = αn = 0
and {v1 , · · · , vn } is called a basis for V if
span (v1 , · · · , vn ) = V
and {v1 , · · · , vn } is linearly independent. The set of vectors is linearly dependent if it is not
linearly independent.

A Fundamental Theorem

The next theorem is called the exchange theorem. It is very important that you understand
this theorem. It is so important that I have given several proofs of it. Some amount to the
same thing, just worded diﬀerently.
Theorem 8.2.4 Let {x1 , · · · , xr } be a linearly independent set of vectors such that each xi
is in the span{y1 , · · · , ys } . Then r ≤ s.
Proof 1:
that

Deﬁne span{y1 , · · · , ys } ≡ V, it follows there exist scalars c1 , · · · , cs such
x1 =

s
∑

ci yi .

(8.5)

i=1

Not all of these scalars can equal zero because if this were the case, it would follow that
x
∑1 r= 0 and so {x1 , · · · , xr } would not be linearly independent. Indeed, if x1 = 0, 1x1 +
i=2 0xi = x1 = 0 and so there would exist a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors
{x1 , · · · , xr } which equals zero.
Say ck ̸= 0. Then solve (8.5) for yk and obtain


s-1 vectors here
z
}|
{
yk ∈ span x1 , y1 , · · · , yk−1 , yk+1 , · · · , ys  .
Deﬁne {z1 , · · · , zs−1 } by
{z1 , · · · , zs−1 } ≡ {y1 , · · · , yk−1 , yk+1 , · · · , ys }
Therefore, span {x1 , z1 , · · · , zs−1 } = V because if v ∈ V, there exist constants c1 , · · · , cs
such that
s−1
∑
v=
ci zi + cs yk .
i=1

Now replace the yk in the above with a linear combination of the vectors, {x1 , z1 , · · · , zs−1 }
to obtain v ∈ span {x1 , z1 , · · · , zs−1 } . The vector yk , in the list {y1 , · · · , ys } , has now been
replaced with the vector x1 and the resulting modiﬁed list of vectors has the same span as
the original list of vectors, {y1 , · · · , ys } .
Now suppose that r > s and that span {x1 , · · · , xl , z1 , · · · , zp } = V where the vectors,
z1 , · · · , zp are each taken from the set, {y1 , · · · , ys } and l + p = s. This has now been done
for l = 1 above. Then since r > s, it follows that l ≤ s < r and so l + 1 ≤ r. Therefore, xl+1
is a vector not in the list, {x1 , · · · , xl } and since span {x1 , · · · , xl , z1 , · · · , zp } = V there
exist scalars ci and dj such that
xl+1 =

l
∑
i=1

ci xi +

p
∑

dj zj .

(8.6)

j=1

Now not all the dj can equal zero because if this were so, it would follow that {x1 , · · · , xr }
would be a linearly dependent set because one of the vectors would equal a linear combination
of the others. Therefore, ((8.6)) can be solved for one of the zi , say zk , in terms of xl+1 and
the other zi and just as in the above argument, replace that zi with xl+1 to obtain



VECTOR SPACES AND FIELDS

Continue this way, eventually obtaining
span (x1 , · · · , xs ) = V.
But then xr ∈ span {x1 , · · · , xs } contrary to the assumption that {x1 , · · · , xr } is linearly
independent. Therefore, r ≤ s as claimed.
Proof 2: Let
s
∑
xk =
ajk yj
j=1

If r > s, then the matrix A = (ajk ) has more columns than rows. By Corollary 4.3.9

which contradicts the assumption that {x1 , · · · , xr } is linearly independent. Hence r ≤ s.
Proof 3: Suppose r > s. Let zk denote a vector of {y1 , · · · , ys } . Thus there exists j as
small as possible such that
span (y1 , · · · , ys ) = span (x1 , · · · , xm , z1 , · · · , zj )
where m + j = s. It is given that m = 0, corresponding to no vectors of {x1 , · · · , xm } and
j = s, corresponding to all the yk results in the above equation holding. If j > 0 then m < s
and so
j

Not all the bi can equal 0 and so you can solve for one of them in terms of xm+1 , xm , · · · , x1 ,
and the other zk . Therefore, there exists
{z1 , · · · , zj−1 } ⊆ {y1 , · · · , ys }
such that
span (y1 , · · · , ys ) = span (x1 , · · · , xm+1 , z1 , · · · , zj−1 )
contradicting the choice of j. Hence j = 0 and
span (y1 , · · · , ys ) = span (x1 , · · · , xs )
It follows that
xs+1 ∈ span (x1 , · · · , xs )
contrary to the assumption the xk are linearly independent. Therefore, r ≤ s as claimed. 
Corollary 8.2.5 If {u1 , · · · , um } and {v1 , · · · , vn } are two bases for V, then m = n.

Deﬁnition 8.2.6 A vector space V is of dimension n if it has a basis consisting of n vectors.
This is well deﬁned thanks to Corollary 8.2.5. It is always assumed here that n < ∞ and in
this case, such a vector space is said to be ﬁnite dimensional.
Example 8.2.7 Consider the polynomials deﬁned
on R }of degree no more than 3, denoted
{
here as P3 . Then show that a basis for P3 is 1, x, x2 , x3 . Here xk symbolizes the function
x 7→ xk .
It is obvious that the span of the given vectors yields P3 . Why is this set of vectors
linearly independent? Suppose
c0 + c1 x + c2 x2 + c3 x3 = 0
where 0 is the zero function which maps everything to 0. Then you could diﬀerentiate three
times and obtain the following equations
c1 + 2c2 x + 3c3 x2 =
2c2 + 6c3 x =
6c3

0
0

=

0

Now this implies c3 = 0. Then from the equations above the bottom one, you ﬁnd in
succession that c2 = 0, c1 = 0, c0 = 0.
There is a somewhat interesting theorem about linear independence of smooth functions
(those having plenty of derivatives) which I will show now. It is often used in diﬀerential
equations.
Deﬁnition 8.2.8 Let f1 , · · · , fn be smooth functions deﬁned on an interval [a, b] . The
Wronskian of these functions is deﬁned as follows.
f1 (x)
f1′ (x)
..

fn

(x)

Note that to get from one row to the next, you just diﬀerentiate everything in that row. The
notation f (k) (x) denotes the k th derivative.
With this deﬁnition, the following is the theorem. The interesting theorem involving the
Wronskian has to do with the situation where the functions are solutions of a diﬀerential
equation. Then much more can be said and it is much more interesting than the following
theorem.
Theorem 8.2.9 Let {f1 , · · · , fn } be smooth functions deﬁned on [a, b] . Then they are linearly independent if there exists some point t ∈ [a, b] where W (f1 , · · · , fn ) (t) ̸= 0.
Proof: Form the linear combination of these vectors (functions) and suppose it equals
0. Thus
a 1 f1 + a 2 f2 + · · · + a n fn = 0
The question you must answer is whether this requires each aj to equal zero. If they all
must equal 0, then this means these vectors (functions) are independent. This is what it
means to be linearly independent.

Since the determinant of the matrix on the left is assumed to be nonzero, it follows this
matrix has an inverse and so the only solution to the above system of equations is to have
each ak = 0. 
Here is a useful lemma.
Lemma 8.2.10 Suppose v ∈
/ span (u1 , · · · , uk ) and {u1 , · · · , uk } is linearly independent.
Then {u1 , · · · , uk , v} is also linearly independent.
∑k
Proof: Suppose i=1 ci ui + dv = 0. It is required to verify that each ci = 0 and that
d = 0. But if d ̸= 0, then you can solve for v as a linear combination of the vectors,
{u1 , · · · , uk },
k ( )
∑

∑k
contrary to assumption. Therefore, d = 0. But then i=1 ci ui = 0 and the linear independence of {u1 , · · · , uk } implies each ci = 0 also. 
Given a spanning set, you can delete vectors till you end up with a basis. Given a linearly
independent set, you can add vectors till you get a basis. This is what the following theorem
is about, weeding and planting.
Theorem 8.2.11 If V = span (u1 , · · · , un ) then some subset of {u1 , · · · , un } is a basis for
V. Also, if {u1 , · · · , uk } ⊆ V is linearly independent and the vector space is ﬁnite dimensional, then the set, {u1 , · · · , uk }, can be enlarged to obtain a basis of V.
Proof: Let
S = {E ⊆ {u1 , · · · , un } such that span (E) = V }.
For E ∈ S, let |E| denote the number of elements of E. Let
m ≡ min{|E| such that E ∈ S}.
Thus there exist vectors
{v1 , · · · , vm } ⊆ {u1 , · · · , un }
such that
span (v1 , · · · , vm ) = V
and m is as small as possible for this to happen. If this set is linearly independent, it follows
it is a basis for V and the theorem is proved. On the other hand, if the set is not linearly
independent, then there exist scalars
c1 , · · · , cm

such that

and not all the ci are equal to zero. Suppose ck ̸= 0. Then the vector, vk may be solved for
in terms of the other vectors. Consequently,
V = span (v1 , · · · , vk−1 , vk+1 , · · · , vm )
contradicting the deﬁnition of m. This proves the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
To obtain the second part, begin with {u1 , · · · , uk } and suppose a basis for V is
{v1 , · · · , vn } .
If
span (u1 , · · · , uk ) = V,
then k = n. If not, there exists a vector,
uk+1 ∈
/ span (u1 , · · · , uk ) .
Then by Lemma 8.2.10, {u1 , · · · , uk , uk+1 } is also linearly independent. Continue adding
vectors in this way until n linearly independent vectors have been obtained. Then
span (u1 , · · · , un ) = V
because if it did not do so, there would exist un+1 as just described and {u1 , · · · , un+1 }
would be a linearly independent set of vectors having n+1 elements even though {v1 , · · · , vn }
is a basis. This would contradict Theorem 8.2.4. Therefore, this list is a basis. 

8.2.3

The Basis Of A Subspace

Every subspace of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space is a span of some vectors and in fact it
has a basis. This is the content of the next theorem.
Theorem 8.2.12 Let V be a nonzero subspace of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, W of
dimension, n. Then V has a basis with no more than n vectors.
Proof: Let v1 ∈ V where v1 ̸= 0. If span {v1 } = V, stop. {v1 } is a basis for V .
Otherwise, there exists v2 ∈ V which is not in span {v1 } . By Lemma 8.2.10 {v1 , v2 } is a
linearly independent set of vectors. If span {v1 , v2 } = V stop, {v1 , v2 } is a basis for V. If
span {v1 , v2 } ̸= V, then there exists v3 ∈
/ span {v1 , v2 } and {v1 , v2 , v3 } is a larger linearly
independent set of vectors. Continuing this way, the process must stop before n + 1 steps
because if not, it would be possible to obtain n + 1 linearly independent vectors contrary to
the exchange theorem, Theorem 8.2.4. 

and it gives a very convincing application of the abstract theory presented earlier in this
chapter.
Here I will give some basic algebra relating to polynomials. This is interesting for its
own sake but also provides the basis for constructing many diﬀerent kinds of ﬁelds. The
ﬁrst is the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials.
∑n
Deﬁnition 8.3.1 A polynomial is an expression of the form p (λ) = k=0 ak λk where as
usual λ0 is deﬁned to equal 1. Two polynomials are said to be equal if their corresponding
coeﬃcients are the same. Thus, in particular, p (λ) = 0 means each of the ak = 0. An
element of the ﬁeld λ is said to be a root of the polynomial if p (λ) = 0 in the sense that
when you plug in λ into the formula and do the indicated operations, you get 0. The degree
of a nonzero polynomial is the highest exponent appearing on λ. The degree of the zero
polynomial p (λ) = 0 is not deﬁned.
Example 8.3.2 Consider the polynomial p (λ) = λ2 + λ where the coeﬃcients are in Z2 . Is
this polynomial equal to 0? Not according to the above deﬁnition, because its coeﬃcients are
not all equal to 0. However, p (1) = p (0) = 0 so it sends every element of Z2 to 0. Note the
distinction between saying it sends everything in the ﬁeld to 0 with having the polynomial be
the zero polynomial.
Lemma 8.3.3 Let f (λ) and g (λ) ̸= 0 be polynomials. Then there exists a polynomial, q (λ)
such that
f (λ) = q (λ) g (λ) + r (λ)
where the degree of r (λ) is less than the degree of g (λ) or r (λ) = 0.
Proof: Consider the polynomials of the form f (λ) − g (λ) l (λ) and out of all these
polynomials, pick one which has the smallest degree. This can be done because of the well
ordering of the natural numbers. Let this take place when l (λ) = q1 (λ) and let
r (λ) = f (λ) − g (λ) q1 (λ) .
It is required to show degree of r (λ) < degree of g (λ) or else r (λ) = 0.
Suppose f (λ) − g (λ) l (λ) is never equal to zero for any l (λ). Then r (λ) ̸= 0. It is
required to show the degree of r (λ) is smaller than the degree of g (λ) . If this doesn’t
happen, then the degree of r ≥ the degree of g. Let
r (λ) =
g (λ) =

bm λm + · · · + b1 λ + b0
an λn + · · · + a1 λ + a0

where m ≥ n and bm and an are nonzero. Then let r1 (λ) be given by
r1 (λ) = r (λ) −
= (bm λm + · · · + b1 λ + b0 ) −

λm−n bm
g (λ)

λm−n bm

and this is not zero by the assumption that f (λ) − g (λ) l (λ) is never equal to zero for any
l (λ) yet has smaller degree than r (λ) which is a contradiction to the choice of r (λ). 
Now with this lemma, here is another one which is very fundamental. First here is a
deﬁnition. A polynomial is monic means it is of the form
λn + cn−1 λn−1 + · · · + c1 λ + c0 .
That is, the leading coeﬃcient is 1. In what follows, the coeﬃcients of polynomials are in
F, a ﬁeld of scalars which is completely arbitrary. Think R if you need an example.
Deﬁnition 8.3.4 A polynomial f is said to divide a polynomial g if g (λ) = f (λ) r (λ) for
some polynomial r (λ). Let {ϕi (λ)} be a ﬁnite set of polynomials. The greatest common
divisor will be the monic polynomial q such that q (λ) divides each ϕi (λ) and if p (λ) divides
each ϕi (λ) , then p (λ) divides q (λ) . The ﬁnite set of polynomials {ϕi } is said to be relatively
prime if their greatest common divisor is 1. A polynomial f (λ) is irreducible if there is no
polynomial with coeﬃcients in F which divides it except nonzero scalar multiples of f (λ)
and constants.
Proposition 8.3.5 The greatest common divisor is unique.
Proof: Suppose both q (λ) and q ′ (λ) work. Then q (λ) divides q ′ (λ) and the other way
around and so
q ′ (λ) = q (λ) l (λ) , q (λ) = l′ (λ) q ′ (λ)
Therefore, the two must have the same degree. Hence l′ (λ) , l (λ) are both constants. However, this constant must be 1 because both q (λ) and q ′ (λ) are monic. 
Theorem 8.3.6 Let ψ (λ) be the greatest common divisor of {ϕi (λ)} , not all of which are
zero polynomials. Then there exist polynomials ri (λ) such that
ψ (λ) =

p
∑

ri (λ) ϕi (λ) .

i=1

Furthermore, ψ (λ) is the monic polynomial of smallest degree which can be written in the
above form.
Proof: Let S denote the set of monic polynomials which are of the form
p
∑

ri (λ) ϕi (λ)

i=1

where ri (λ) is a polynomial. Then S ̸=∑∅ because some ϕi (λ) ̸= 0. Then let the ri be chosen
p
such that the degree of the expression i=1 ri (λ) ϕi (λ) is as small as possible. Letting ψ (λ)
equal this sum, it remains to verify it is the greatest common divisor. First, does it divide
each ϕi (λ)? Suppose it fails to divide ϕ1 (λ) . Then by Lemma 8.3.3
ϕ1 (λ) = ψ (λ) l (λ) + r (λ)
where degree of r (λ) is less than that of ψ (λ). Then dividing r (λ) by the leading coeﬃcient
if necessary and denoting the result by ψ 1 (λ) , it follows the degree of ψ 1 (λ) is less than
the degree of ψ (λ) and ψ 1 (λ) equals
ψ 1 (λ) = (ϕ1 (λ) − ψ (λ) l (λ)) a

for a suitable a ∈ F. This is one of the polynomials in S. Therefore, ψ (λ) does not have
the smallest degree after all because the degree of ψ 1 (λ) is smaller. This is a contradiction.
Therefore, ψ (λ) divides ϕ1 (λ) . Similarly it divides all the other ϕi (λ).
If p ∑
(λ) divides all the ϕi (λ) , then it divides ψ (λ) because of the formula for ψ (λ) which
p
equals i=1 ri (λ) ϕi (λ) . 
Lemma 8.3.7 Suppose ϕ (λ) and ψ (λ) are monic polynomials which are irreducible and
not equal. Then they are relatively prime.
Proof: Suppose η (λ) is a nonconstant polynomial. If η (λ) divides ϕ (λ) , then since
ϕ (λ) is irreducible, η (λ) equals aϕ (λ) for some a ∈ F. If η (λ) divides ψ (λ) then it must
be of the form bψ (λ) for some b ∈ F and so it follows
a
ψ (λ) = ϕ (λ)
b
but both ψ (λ) and ϕ (λ) are monic polynomials which implies a = b and so ψ (λ) = ϕ (λ).
This is assumed not to happen. It follows the only polynomials which divide both ψ (λ)
and ϕ (λ) are constants and so the two polynomials are relatively prime. Thus a polynomial
which divides them both must be a constant, and if it is monic, then it must be 1. Thus 1
is the greatest common divisor. 
Lemma 8.3.8 Let ψ (λ) be an irreducible monic polynomial not equal to 1 which divides
p
∏

k

ϕi (λ) i , ki a positive integer,

i=1

where each ϕi (λ) is an irreducible monic polynomial. Then ψ (λ) equals some ϕi (λ) .
Proof : Suppose ψ (λ) ̸= ϕi (λ) for all i. Then by Lemma 8.3.7, there exist polynomials
mi (λ) , ni (λ) such that
1 = ψ (λ) mi (λ) + ϕi (λ) ni (λ) .
Hence
(ϕi (λ) ni (λ))

ki

Then, letting ge (λ) = i=1 ni (λ) i , and applying the binomial theorem, there exists a

g (λ) ψ (λ) = 1 + ψ (λ) h (λ)
1 = ψ (λ) (h (λ) − g (λ))
which is impossible if ψ (λ) is non constant, as assumed. 
Now here is a simple lemma about canceling monic polynomials.

8.3. LOTS OF FIELDS

Lemma 8.3.9 Suppose p (λ) is a monic polynomial and q (λ) is a polynomial such that
p (λ) q (λ) = 0.
Then q (λ) = 0. Also if
p (λ) q1 (λ) = p (λ) q2 (λ)
then q1 (λ) = q2 (λ) .
Proof: Let
p (λ) =

k
∑

pj λj , q (λ) =

j=1

n
∑

qi λi , pk = 1.

i=1

Then the product equals
k ∑
n
∑

pj qi λi+j .

j=1 i=1

Then look at those terms involving λk+n . This is pk qn λk+n and is given to be 0. Since
pk = 1, it follows qn = 0. Thus
k n−1
∑
∑
pj qi λi+j = 0.
j=1 i=1

Then consider the term involving λn−1+k and conclude that since pk = 1, it follows qn−1 = 0.
Continuing this way, each qi = 0. This proves the ﬁrst part. The second follows from
p (λ) (q1 (λ) − q2 (λ)) = 0. 
The following is the analog of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic for polynomials.
Theorem 8.3.10 Let f (λ) be a nonconstant
polynomial with coeﬃcients in F. Then there
∏n
is some a ∈ F such that f (λ) = a i=1 ϕi (λ) where ϕi (λ) is an irreducible nonconstant
monic polynomial and repeats are allowed. Furthermore, this factorization is unique in the
sense that any two of these factorizations have the same nonconstant factors in the product,
possibly in diﬀerent order and the same constant a.
Proof: That such a factorization exists is obvious. If f (λ) is irreducible, you are done.
Factor out the leading coeﬃcient. If not, then f (λ) = aϕ1 (λ) ϕ2 (λ) where these are monic
polynomials. Continue doing this with the ϕi and eventually arrive at a factorization of the
desired form.
It remains to argue the factorization is unique except for order of the factors. Suppose
a

n
∏

ϕi (λ) = b

i=1

m
∏

ψ i (λ)

i=1

where the ϕi (λ) and the ψ i (λ) are all irreducible monic nonconstant polynomials and a, b ∈
F. If n > m, then by Lemma 8.3.8, each ψ i (λ) equals one of the ϕj (λ) . By the above
cancellation lemma, Lemma 8.3.9, you can cancel all these ψ i (λ) with appropriate ϕj (λ)
and obtain a contradiction because the resulting polynomials on either side would have
diﬀerent degrees. Similarly, it cannot happen that n < m. It follows n = m and the two
products consist of the same polynomials. Then it follows a = b. 
The following corollary will be well used. This corollary seems rather believable but does
require a proof.

Polynomials And Fields

When you have a polynomial like x2 − 3 which has no rational roots, it turns out you can
enlarge the ﬁeld of rational numbers to obtain a larger ﬁeld such that this polynomial does
have roots in this larger ﬁeld. I am going to discuss a systematic way to do this. It will
turn out that for any polynomial with coeﬃcients in any ﬁeld, there always exists a possibly
larger ﬁeld such that the polynomial has roots in this larger ﬁeld. This book has mainly
featured the ﬁeld of real or complex numbers but this procedure will show how to obtain
many other ﬁelds which could be used in most of what was presented earlier in the book.
Here is an important idea concerning equivalence relations which I hope is familiar.
Deﬁnition 8.3.12 Let S be a set. The symbol, ∼ is called an equivalence relation on S if
it satisﬁes the following axioms.
1. x ∼ x

for all x ∈ S. (Reﬂexive)

2. If x ∼ y then y ∼ x. (Symmetric)
3. If x ∼ y and y ∼ z, then x ∼ z. (Transitive)
Deﬁnition 8.3.13 [x] denotes the set of all elements of S which are equivalent to x and
[x] is called the equivalence class determined by x or just the equivalence class of x.
Also recall the notion of equivalence classes.
Theorem 8.3.14 Let ∼ be an equivalence class deﬁned on a set, S and let H denote the
set of equivalence classes. Then if [x] and [y] are two of these equivalence classes, either
x ∼ y and [x] = [y] or it is not true that x ∼ y and [x] ∩ [y] = ∅.

(a (x) is similar to b (x)) when
a (x) − b (x) = k (x) p (x)
for some polynomial k (x) .
Proposition 8.3.16 In the above deﬁnition, ∼ is an equivalence relation.
Proof: First of all, note that a (x) ∼ a (x) because their diﬀerence equals 0p (x) . If
a (x) ∼ b (x) , then a (x) − b (x) = k (x) p (x) for some k (x) . But then b (x) − a (x) =
−k (x) p (x) and so b (x) ∼ a (x). Next suppose a (x) ∼ b (x) and b (x) ∼ c (x) . Then
a (x) − b (x) = k (x) p (x) for some polynomial k (x) and also b (x) − c (x) = l (x) p (x) for
some polynomial l (x) . Then
a (x) − c (x) = a (x) − b (x) + b (x) − c (x)
= k (x) p (x) + l (x) p (x) = (l (x) + k (x)) p (x)
and so a (x) ∼ c (x) and this shows the transitive law. 
With this proposition, here is another deﬁnition which essentially describes the elements
of the new ﬁeld. It will eventually be necessary to assume the polynomial p (x) in the above
deﬁnition is irreducible so I will begin assuming this.
Deﬁnition 8.3.17 Let F be a ﬁeld and let p (x) ∈ F [x] be a monic irreducible polynomial.
This means there is no polynomial having coeﬃcients in F which divides p (x) except for itself
and constants. For the similarity relation deﬁned in Deﬁnition 8.3.15, deﬁne the following
operations on the equivalence classes. [a (x)] is an equivalence class means that it is the set
of all polynomials which are similar to a (x).
[a (x)] + [b (x)]
[a (x)] [b (x)]

≡ [a (x) + b (x)]
≡ [a (x) b (x)]

This collection of equivalence classes is sometimes denoted by F [x] / (p (x)).
Proposition 8.3.18 In the situation of Deﬁnition 8.3.17, p (x) and q (x) are relatively
prime for any q (x) ∈ F [x] which is not a multiple of p (x). Also the deﬁnitions of addition
and multiplication are well deﬁned. In addition, if a, b ∈ F and [a] = [b] , then a = b.
Proof: First consider the claim about p (x) , q (x) being relatively prime. If ψ (x) is the
greatest common divisor, it follows ψ (x) is either equal to p (x) or 1. If it is p (x) , then
q (x) is a multiple of p (x) . If it is 1, then by deﬁnition, the two polynomials are relatively
prime.
To show the operations are well deﬁned, suppose
[a (x)] = [a′ (x)] , [b (x)] = [b′ (x)]
It is necessary to show

[a (x) + b (x)] = [a′ (x) + b′ (x)]
[a (x) b (x)] = [a′ (x) b′ (x)]

Consider the second of the two.

=

a′ (x) b′ (x) − a (x) b (x)
a′ (x) b′ (x) − a (x) b′ (x) + a (x) b′ (x) − a (x) b (x)

=

b′ (x) (a′ (x) − a (x)) + a (x) (b′ (x) − b (x))

Now by assumption (a′ (x) − a (x)) is a multiple of p (x) as is (b′ (x) − b (x)) , so the above
is a multiple of p (x) and by deﬁnition this shows [a (x) b (x)] = [a′ (x) b′ (x)]. The case for
addition is similar.
Now suppose [a] = [b] . This means a − b = k (x) p (x) for some polynomial k (x) . Then
k (x) must equal 0 since otherwise the two polynomials a − b and k (x) p (x) could not be
equal because they would have diﬀerent degree. 

(8.7)

With the above preparation, here is a deﬁnition of a ﬁeld in which the irreducible polynomial p (x) has a root.
Deﬁnition 8.3.19 Let p (x) ∈ F [x] be irreducible and let a (x) ∼ b (x) when a (x) − b (x) is
a multiple of p (x) . Let G denote the set of equivalence classes as described above with the
operations also described in Deﬁnition 8.3.17.
Also here is another useful deﬁnition and a simple proposition which comes from it.
Deﬁnition 8.3.20 Let F ⊆ K be two ﬁelds. Then clearly K is also a vector space over
F. Then also, K is called a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of F if the dimension of this vector space,
denoted by [K : F ] is ﬁnite.
There are some easy things to observe about this.
Proposition 8.3.21 Let F ⊆ K ⊆ L be ﬁelds. Then [L : F ] = [L : K] [K : F ].

Proof: Let {li }i=1 be a basis for L over K and let {kj }j=1 be a basis of K over F . Then
if l ∈ L, there exist unique scalars xi in K such that

Now xi ∈ K so there exist fji such that

213

Then, since the li are independent, it follows that
m
∑

fji kj = 0

j=1

and since {kj } is independent, each fji = 0 for each j for a given arbitrary i. Therefore,
{kj li } is a basis. 
Theorem 8.3.22 The set of all equivalence classes G ≡ F/ (p (x)) described above with
the multiplicative identity given by [1] and the additive identity given by [0] along with the
operations of Deﬁnition 8.3.17, is a ﬁeld and p ([x]) = [0] . (Thus p has a root in this new
ﬁeld.) In addition to this, [G : F] = n, the degree of p (x) .
Proof: Everything is obvious except for the existence of the multiplicative inverse and
the assertion that p ([x]) = 0. Suppose then that [a (x)] ̸= [0] . That is, a (x) is not a multiple
−1
of p (x). Why does [a (x)] exist? By Theorem 8.3.6, a (x) , p (x) are relatively prime and
so there exist polynomials ψ (x) , ϕ (x) such that
1 = ψ (x) p (x) + a (x) ϕ (x)
and so
1 − a (x) ϕ (x) = ψ (x) p (x)
which, by deﬁnition implies
[1 − a (x) ϕ (x)] = [1] − [a (x) ϕ (x)] = [1] − [a (x)] [ϕ (x)] = [0]
−1

and so [ϕ (x)] = [a (x)] . This shows G is a ﬁeld.
Now if p (x) = an xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0 , p ([x]) = 0 by (8.7) and the deﬁnition
which says [p (x)] = [0].
[ ]
Consider the claim about the dimension.
It[ was ]just shown that [1] , [x] , x2 , · · · , [xn ]
[ 2]
is linearly dependent. Also [1] , [x] , x , · · · , xn−1 is independent because if not, there
would exist a polynomial q (x) of degree n−1 which is a multiple of p (x) which is impossible.
Now for [q (x)] ∈ G, you can write
q (x) = p (x) l (x) + r (x)
where the degree of r (x) is less than
0. Either way, [q (x)] = [r (x)] which
[ n] or else
[ it equals
]
is a linear combination of [1] , [x] , x2 , · · · , xn−1 . Thus [G : F] = n as claimed. 
Note that if p (x) were not irreducible, then you could ﬁnd a ﬁeld extension G such that
[G : F] ≤ n. You could do this by working with an irreducible factor of p (x).
Usually, people simply write b rather than [b] if b ∈ F. Then with this convention,
[bϕ (x)] = [b] [ϕ (x)] = b [ϕ (x)] .
This shows how to enlarge a ﬁeld to get a new one in which the polynomial has a root.
By using a succession of such enlargements, called ﬁeld extensions, there will exist a ﬁeld
in which the given polynomial can be factored into a product of polynomials having degree
one. The ﬁeld you obtain in this process of enlarging in which the given polynomial factors
in terms of linear factors is called a splitting ﬁeld.

Theorem 8.3.23 Let p (x) = xn +an−1 xn−1 +· · ·+a1 x+a0 be a polynomial with coeﬃcients
in a ﬁeld of scalars F. There exists a larger ﬁeld G such that there exist {z1 , · · · , zn } listed
according to multiplicity such that
p (x) =

n
∏

(x − zi )

i=1

This larger ﬁeld is called a splitting ﬁeld. Furthermore,
[G : F] ≤ n!
Proof: From Theorem 8.3.22, there exists a ﬁeld F1 such that p (x) has a root, z1 (= [x]
if p is irreducible.) Then by the Euclidean algorithm
p (x) = (x − z1 ) q1 (x) + r
where r ∈ F1 . Since p (z1 ) = 0, this requires r = 0. Now do the same for q1 (x) that was
done for p (x) , enlarging the ﬁeld to F2 if necessary, such that in this new ﬁeld
q1 (x) = (x − z2 ) q2 (x) .
and so
p (x) = (x − z1 ) (x − z2 ) q2 (x)
After n such extensions, you will have obtained the necessary ﬁeld G.
Finally consider the claim about dimension. By Theorem 8.3.22, there is a larger ﬁeld
G1 such that p (x) has a root a1 in G1 and [G : F] ≤ n. Then
p (x) = (x − a1 ) q (x)
Continue this way until the polynomial equals the product of linear factors. Then by
Proposition 8.3.21 applied multiple times, [G : F] ≤ n!. 
Example 8.3.24 The polynomial x2 + 1 is irreducible in R (x) , polynomials having real
coeﬃcients. To see this is the case, suppose ψ (x) divides x2 + 1. Then
x2 + 1 = ψ (x) q (x)
If the degree of ψ (x) is less than 2, then it must be either a constant or of the form ax + b.
In the latter case, −b/a must be a zero of the right side, hence of the left but x2 + 1 has no
real zeros. Therefore, the degree of ψ (x) must be two and q (x) must be a constant. Thus
the only polynomial which divides x2 + 1 are constants
of x2 + 1. Therefore,
[ 2 and multiples
]

this shows x( + 1 is) irreducible. Find the inverse of x + x + 1 in the space of equivalence
classes, R/ x2 + 1 .
You can solve this with partial fractions.

1 = (−x) x2 + x + 1 + (x + 1) x2 + 1

and so the inverse is [−x] .
The following proposition is interesting. It was essentially proved above but to emphasize
it, here it is again.

Proposition 8.3.25 Suppose p (x) ∈ F [x] is irreducible and has degree n. Then every
element of G = F [x] / (p (x)) is of the form [0] or [r (x)] where the degree of r (x) is less
than n.
Proof: This follows right away from the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. If k (x)
has degree larger than n − 1, then
k (x) = q (x) p (x) + r (x)
where r (x) is either equal to 0 or has degree less than n. Hence
[k (x)] = [r (x)] . 

The Algebraic Numbers

Each polynomial having coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld F has a splitting ﬁeld. Consider the case of all
polynomials p (x) having coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld F ⊆ G and consider all roots which are also
in G. The theory of vector spaces is very useful in the study of these algebraic numbers.
Here is a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.3.27 The algebraic numbers A are those numbers which are in G and also
roots of some polynomial p (x) having coeﬃcients in F.
Theorem 8.3.28 Let a ∈ A. Then there exists a unique monic irreducible polynomial p (x)
having coeﬃcients in F such that p (a) = 0. This is called the minimal polynomial for a.
Proof: By deﬁnition, there exists a polynomial q (x) having coeﬃcients in F such that
q (a) = 0. If q (x) is irreducible, divide by the leading coeﬃcient and this proves the existence.
If q (x) is not irreducible, then there exist nonconstant polynomials r (x) and k (x) such that
q (x) = r (x) k (x). Then one of r (a) , k (a) equals 0. Pick the one which equals zero and let it
play the role of q (x). Continuing this way, in ﬁnitely many steps one obtains an irreducible
polynomial p (x) such that p (a) = 0. Now divide by the leading coeﬃcient and this proves
existence. Suppose pi , i = 1, 2 both work and they are not equal. Then by Lemma 8.3.7

216

VECTOR SPACES AND FIELDS

they must be relatively prime because they are both assumed to be irreducible and so there
exist polynomials l (x) , k (x) such that
1 = l (x) p1 (x) + k (x) p2 (x)
But now when a is substituted for x, this yields 0 = 1, a contradiction. The polynomials
are equal after all. 
Deﬁnition 8.3.29 For a an algebraic number, let deg (a) denote the degree of the minimal
polynomial of a.
Also, here is another deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.3.30 Let a1 , · · · , am be in A. A polynomial in {a1 , · · · , am } will be an expression of the form
∑
ak1 ···kn ak11 · · · aknn
k1 ···kn

where the ak1 ···kn are in F, each kj is a nonnegative integer, and all but ﬁnitely many of the
ak1 ···kn equal zero. The collection of such polynomials will be denoted by
F [a1 , · · · , am ] .
Now notice that for a an algebraic number, F [a] is a vector space with ﬁeld of scalars F.
Similarly, for {a1 , · · · , am } algebraic numbers, F [a1 , · · · , am ] is a vector space with ﬁeld of
scalars F. The following fundamental proposition is important.
Proposition 8.3.31 Let {a1 , · · · , am } be algebraic numbers. Then
dim F [a1 , · · · , am ] ≤

m
∏

deg (aj )

j=1

and for an algebraic number a,
dim F [a] = deg (a)
Every element of F [a1 , · · · , am ] is in A and F [a1 , · · · , am ] is a ﬁeld.
Proof: First consider the second assertion. Let the minimal polynomial of a be
p (x) = xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0 .
{
}
Since p (a) = 0, it follows 1, a, a2 , · · · , an is linearly dependent. However, if the degree
of q (x) is less than the degree of p (x) , then if q (x) is not a constant, the two must be
relatively prime because p (x) is irreducible and so there exist polynomials k (x) , l (x) such
that
1 = l (x) q (x) + k (x) p (x)
and this is a contradiction if q (a) = 0 because it would imply upon replacing x with a that
1 = 0. Therefore, no polynomial having degree less than n can have a as a root. It follows
{
}
1, a, a2 , · · · , an−1
is linearly independent. Thus dim F [a] = deg (a) = n. Here is why this is. If q (a) is any
element of F [a] ,
q (x) = p (x) k (x) + r (x)

(
)
where deg r (x) < deg p (x) and so q (a) = r (a) and r (a) ∈ span 1, a, a2 , · · · , an−1 .
Now consider{the ﬁrst claim. }
By deﬁnition, F [a1 , · · · , am ] is obtained from all linear
k1
k2
kn
combinations of a1 , a2 , · · · , an
where the ki are nonnegative integers. From the ﬁrst
part, it suﬃces to consider only kj ≤ deg (aj ). Therefore, there exists a spanning set for
F [a1 , · · · , am ] which has
m
∏
deg (ai )
i=1

entries. By Theorem 8.2.4 this proves the ﬁrst claim.
Finally consider the last claim. Let g (a1 , · · · , am ) be a polynomial in {a1 , · · · , am } in
F [a1 , · · · , am ]. Since
dim F [a1 , · · · , am ] ≡ p ≤

m
∏

deg (aj ) < ∞,

j=1

it follows
2

p

1, g (a1 , · · · , am ) , g (a1 , · · · , am ) , · · · , g (a1 , · · · , am )

are dependent. It follows g (a1 , · · · , am ) is the root of some polynomial having coeﬃcients
in F. Thus everything in F [a1 , · · · , am ] is algebraic. Why is F [a1 , · · · , am ] a ﬁeld? Let
g (a1 , · · · , am ) be as just mentioned. Then it has a minimal polynomial,
p (x) = xp + ap−1 xp−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0
where the ai ∈ F. Then a0 ̸= 0 or else the polynomial would not be minimal. Therefore,

p−2
g (a1 , · · · , am ) g (a1 , · · · , am )

+ ap−1 g (a1 , · · · , am )

p−2

+ · · · + a1

The other axioms of a ﬁeld are obvious. 
Now from this proposition, it is easy to obtain the following interesting result about the
algebraic numbers.
Theorem 8.3.32 The algebraic numbers A, those roots of polynomials in F [x] which are
in G, are a ﬁeld.
Proof: Let a be an algebraic number and let p (x) be its minimal polynomial. Then
p (x) is of the form
xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0
where a0 ̸= 0. Then plugging in a yields

)
a

(an−1 +an−1 an−2 +···+a1 )(−1)
and so a−1 =

a0
is in A and this shows that for every element of A, its inverse is also in A. What about
products and sums of things in A? Are they still in A? Yes. If a, b ∈ A, then both a + b
and ab ∈ F [a, b] and from the proposition, each element of F [a, b] is in A. 

VECTOR SPACES AND FIELDS

A typical example of what is of interest here is when the ﬁeld F of scalars is Q, the
rational numbers and the ﬁeld G is R. However, you can certainly conceive of many other
examples by considering the integers mod a prime, for example (See Problem 34 on Page
222 for example.) or any of the ﬁelds which occur as ﬁeld extensions in the above.
There is a very interesting thing about F [a1 · · · an ] in the case where F is inﬁnite which
says that there exists a single algebraic γ such that F [a1 · · · an ] = F [γ]. In other words,
every ﬁeld extension of this sort is a simple ﬁeld extension. I found this fact in an early
version of [5].
Proposition 8.3.33 There exists γ such that F [a1 · · · an ] = F [γ].
Proof: To begin with, consider F [α, β]. Let γ = α + λβ. Then by Proposition 8.3.31 γ
is an algebraic number and it is also clear
F [γ] ⊆ F [α, β]
I need to show the other inclusion. This will be done for a suitable choice of λ. To do this,
it suﬃces to verify that both α and β are in F [γ].
Let the minimal polynomials of α and β be f (x) and g (x) respectively. Let the distinct
roots of f (x) and g (x) be {α1 , α2 , · · · , αn } and {β 1 , β 2 , · · · , β m } respectively. These roots
are in a ﬁeld which contains splitting ﬁelds of both f (x) and g (x). Let α = α1 and β = β 1 .
Now deﬁne
h (x) ≡ f (α + λβ − λx) ≡ f (γ − λx)
so that h (β) = f (α) = 0. It follows (x − β) divides both h((x) and) g (x). If (x − η) is a
diﬀerent linear factor of both g (x) and h (x) then it must be x − β j for some β j for some
j > 1 because these are the only factors of g (x) . Therefore, this would require
( )
(
)
0 = h β j = f α1 + λβ 1 − λβ j
and so it would be the case that α1 + λβ 1 − λβ j = αk for some k. Hence
λ=

αk − α1
β1 − βj

Now there are ﬁnitely many quotients of the above form and if λ is chosen to not be any of
them, then the above cannot happen and so in this case, the only linear factor of both g (x)
and h (x) will be (x − β). Choose such a λ.
Let ϕ (x) be the minimal polynomial of β with respect to the ﬁeld F [γ]. Then this
minimal polynomial must divide both h (x) and g (x) because h (β) = g (β) = 0. However,
the only factor these two have in common is x − β and so ϕ (x) = x − β which requires
β ∈ F [γ] . Now also α = γ − λβ and so α ∈ F [γ] also. Therefore, both α, β ∈ F [γ] which
forces F [α, β] ⊆ F [γ] . This proves the proposition in the case that n = 2. The general result
follows right away by observing that
F [a1 · · · an ] = F [a1 · · · an−1 ] [an ]
and using induction. 
When you have a ﬁeld F, F (a) denotes the smallest ﬁeld which contains both F and a.
When a is algebraic over F, it follows that F (a) = F [a] . The latter is easier to think about
because it just involves polynomials.

The Lindemannn Weierstrass Theorem And Vector Spaces

As another application of the abstract concept of vector spaces, there is an amazing theorem
due to Weierstrass and Lindemannn.
Theorem 8.3.34 Suppose a1 , · · · , an are algebraic numbers and suppose α1 , · · · , αn are
distinct algebraic numbers. Then
n
∑
ai eαi ̸= 0
i=1

In other words, the {eα1 , · · · , eαn } are independent as vectors with ﬁeld of scalars equal to
the algebraic numbers.
There is a proof of this in the appendix. It is long and hard but only depends on
elementary considerations other than some algebra involving symmetric polynomials. See
Theorem F.3.5.
A number is transcendental if it is not a root of a polynomial which has integer coeﬃcients. Most numbers are this way but it is hard to verify that speciﬁc numbers are
transcendental. That π is transcendental follows from
e0 + eiπ = 0.
By the above theorem, this could not happen if π were algebraic because then iπ would also
be algebraic. Recall these algebraic numbers form a ﬁeld and i is clearly algebraic, being
a root of x2 + 1. This fact about π was ﬁrst proved by Lindemannn in 1882 and then the
general theorem above was proved by Weierstrass in 1885. This fact that π is transcendental
solved an old problem called squaring the circle which was to construct a square with the
same area as a circle using a straight edge and compass. It can be shown that the fact π is
transcendental implies this problem is impossible.1

Ida which opened in 1884 he has the following lines. “As for fashion they forswear it, so the say - so they
say; and the circle - they will square it some ﬁne day some ﬁne day.” Of course it had been proved impossible
to do this a couple of years before.

Suppose A is an m × n matrix and B is an n × p matrix. Show that

Hint: Consider the subspace, B (Fp ) ∩ ker (A) and suppose a basis for this subspace

be such that Bzi = wi and argue that

33. Recall that every positive integer can be factored into a product of primes in a unique
way. Show there must be inﬁnitely many primes. Hint: Show that if you have any
ﬁnite set of primes and you multiply them and then add 1, the result cannot be
divisible by any of the primes in your ﬁnite set. This idea in the hint is due to Euclid
who lived about 300 B.C.
34. There are lots of ﬁelds. This will give an example of a ﬁnite ﬁeld. Let Z denote the set
of integers. Thus Z = {· · · , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, · · · }. Also let p be a prime number.
We will say that two integers, a, b are equivalent and write a ∼ b if a − b is divisible
by p. Thus they are equivalent if a − b = px for some integer x. First show that
a ∼ a. Next show that if a ∼ b then b ∼ a. Finally show that if a ∼ b and b ∼ c
then a ∼ c. For a an integer, denote by [a] the set of all integers which is equivalent
to a, the equivalence class of a. Show ﬁrst that is suﬃces to consider only [a] for
a = 0, 1, 2, · · · , p − 1 and that for 0 ≤ a < b ≤ p − 1, [a] ̸= [b]. That is, [a] = [r] where
r ∈ {0, 1, 2, · · · , p − 1}. Thus there are exactly p of these equivalence classes. Hint:
Recall the Euclidean algorithm. For a > 0, a = mp + r where r < p. Next deﬁne the
following operations.
[a] + [b]
[a] [b]

≡ [a + b]
≡ [ab]

Show these operations are well deﬁned. That is, if [a] = [a′ ] and [b] = [b′ ] , then
[a] + [b] = [a′ ] + [b′ ] with a similar conclusion holding for multiplication. Thus for
addition you need to verify [a + b] = [a′ + b′ ] and for multiplication you need to verify
[ab] = [a′ b′ ]. For example, if p = 5 you have [3] = [8] and [2] = [7] . Is [2 × 3] = [8 × 7]?
Is [2 + 3] = [8 + 7]? Clearly so in this example because when you subtract, the result
is divisible by 5. So why is this so in general? Now verify that {[0] , [1] , · · · , [p − 1]}
with these operations is a Field. This is called the integers modulo a prime and is
written Zp . Since there are inﬁnitely many primes p, it follows there are inﬁnitely
many of these ﬁnite ﬁelds. Hint: Most of the axioms are easy once you have shown
the operations are well deﬁned. The only two which are tricky are the ones which
give the existence of the additive inverse and the multiplicative inverse. Of these, the

ﬁrst is not hard. − [x] = [−x]. Since p is prime, there exist integers x, y such that
1 = px+ky and so 1−ky = px which says 1 ∼ ky and so [1] = [ky] . Now you ﬁnish the
argument. What is the multiplicative identity in this collection of equivalence classes?
Of course you could now consider ﬁeld extensions based on these ﬁelds.
35. Suppose the ﬁeld of scalars is Z2 described above. Show that

Thus the identity is a comutator. Compare this with Problem 50 on Page 198.
36. Suppose V is a vector space with ﬁeld of scalars F. Let T ∈ L (V, W ) , the space of
linear transformations mapping V onto W where W is another vector space. Deﬁne
an equivalence relation on V as follows. v ∼ w means v − w ∈ ker (T ) . Recall that
ker (T ) ≡ {v : T v = 0}. Show this is an equivalence relation. Now for [v] an equivalence class deﬁne T ′ [v] ≡ T v. Show this is well deﬁned. Also show that with the
operations
[v] + [w] ≡ [v + w]
α [v] ≡ [αv]
this set of equivalence classes, denoted by V / ker (T ) is a vector space. Show next that
T ′ : V / ker (T ) → W is one to one, linear, and onto. This new vector space, V / ker (T )
is called a quotient space. Show its dimension equals the diﬀerence between the
dimension of V and the dimension of ker (T ).

those which are roots of a polynomial having integer (rational) coeﬃcients. What is
the dimension of the vector space C with ﬁeld of scalars A, ﬁnite or inﬁnite? If the
ﬁeld of scalars were C instead of A, would this change? What if the ﬁeld of scalars
were R?

where the polynomials qi (x) are relatively prime and all the polynomials p (x) and
qi (x) have coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld of scalars F. Thus there exist polynomials ai (x)

Now continue doing this on each term in the above sum till ﬁnally you obtain an

Using the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials, explain why the above is of the form

where the degree of each ri (x) is less than the degree of qi (x) and M (x) is a polynomial. Now argue that M (x) = 0. From this explain why the usual partial fractions
expansion of calculus must be true. You can use the fact that every polynomial having
real coeﬃcients factors into a product of irreducible quadratic polynomials and linear
polynomials having real coeﬃcients. This follows from the fundamental theorem of
algebra in the appendix.

Linear Transformations
9.1

Matrix Multiplication As A Linear Transformation

Deﬁnition 9.1.1 Let V and W be two ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces. A function, L
which maps V to W is called a linear transformation and written L ∈ L (V, W ) if for all
scalars α and β, and vectors v,w,
L (αv+βw) = αL (v) + βL (w) .
An example of a linear transformation is familiar matrix multiplication. Let A = (aij )

Deﬁnition 9.2.1 Given L, M ∈ L (V, W ) deﬁne a new element of L (V, W ) , denoted by
L + M according to the rule1
(L + M ) v ≡ Lv + M v.
For α a scalar and L ∈ L (V, W ) , deﬁne αL ∈ L (V, W ) by
αL (v) ≡ α (Lv) .
You should verify that all the axioms of a vector space hold for L (V, W ) with the
above deﬁnitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication. What about the dimension
of L (V, W )?
Before answering this question, here is a useful lemma. It gives a way to deﬁne linear
transformations and a way to tell when two of them are equal.
1 Note

that this is the standard way of deﬁning the sum of two functions.

Then if L : V → W is given by Lvk = wk ∈ W and

then L is well deﬁned and is in L (V, W ) . Also, if L, M are two linear transformations such
that Lvk = M vk for all k, then M = L.
Proof: L is well deﬁned on V because, since {v1 , · · · , vn } is a basis, there is exactly one
way to write a given vector of V as a linear combination. Next, observe
that L is obviously
∑n
linear from the deﬁnition. If L, M are equal on the basis, then if k=1 ak vk is an arbitrary

and so L = M because they give the same result for every vector in V . 
The message is that when you deﬁne a linear transformation, it suﬃces to tell what it
does to a basis.
Theorem 9.2.3 Let V and W be ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces of dimension n and m
respectively Then dim (L (V, W )) = mn.
Proof: Let two sets of bases be
{v1 , · · · , vn } and {w1 , · · · , wm }
for V and W respectively. Using Lemma 9.2.2, let wi vj ∈ L (V, W ) be the linear transformation deﬁned on the basis, {v1 , · · · , vn }, by
wi vk (vj ) ≡ wi δ jk
where δ ik = 1 if i = k and 0 if i ̸= k. I will show that L ∈ L (V, W ) is a linear combination
of these special linear transformations called dyadics.
Then let L ∈ L (V, W ). Since {w1 , · · · , wm } is a basis, there exist constants, djk such
that

Lvr =

Now consider the following sum of dyadics.

Therefore, L = j=1 i=1 dji wj vi showing the span of the dyadics is all of L (V, W ) .
Now consider whether these dyadics form a linearly independent set. Suppose

Are all the scalars dik equal to 0?

and so, since {w1 , · · · , wm } is a basis, dil = 0 for each i = 1, · · · , m. Since l is arbitrary,
this shows dil = 0 for all i and l. Thus these linear transformations form a basis and this
shows that the dimension of L (V, W ) is mn as claimed because there are m choices for the
wi and n choices for the vj . 

9.3

The Matrix Of A Linear Transformation

Deﬁnition 9.3.1 In Theorem 9.2.3, the matrix of the linear transformation L ∈ L (V, W )
with respect to the ordered bases β ≡ {v1 , · · · , vn } for V and γ ≡ {w∑
1 , · · · , wm } for W is
deﬁned to be [L] where [L]ij = dij . Thus this matrix is deﬁned by L = i,j [L]ij wi vi . When
it is desired to feature the bases β, γ, this matrix will be denoted as [L]γβ . When there is
only one basis β, this is denoted as [L]β .
If V is an n dimensional vector space and β = {v1 , · · · , vn } is a basis for V, there exists
a linear map
q β : Fn → V
deﬁned as
qβ (a) ≡

for ei the standard basis vectors for Fn consisting of 0 · · · 1 · · · 0
. Thus the 1
is in the ith position and the other entries are 0.
It is clear that q deﬁned in this way, is one to one, onto, and linear. For v ∈ V, qβ−1 (v)
is a vector in Fn called the component vector of v with respect to the basis {v1 , · · · , vn }.
where

Proposition 9.3.2 The matrix of a linear transformation with respect to ordered bases β, γ
as described above is characterized by the requirement that multiplication of the components
of v by [L]γβ gives the components of Lv.

and so the j th component of Lv is i [L]ji xi , the j th component of the matrix times the
component vector of v. Could there be some other matrix which will do this? No, because if
such a matrix is M, then for any x , it follows from what was just shown that [L] x = M x.
Hence [L] = M . 

β = {e1 , · · · , en } , γ = {e1 , · · · , em }
Let L be a linear transformation from Fn to Fm and let A be the matrix of the transformation
with respect to these bases. In this case the coordinate maps qβ and qγ are simply the
identity maps on Fn and Fm respectively, and can be accomplished by simply multiplying

by the appropriate sized identity matrix. The requirement that A is the matrix of the

Lb = Ab
What about the situation where diﬀerent pairs of bases are chosen for V and W ? How

LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

2. If x ∼ y then y ∼ x. (Symmetric)
3. If x ∼ y and y ∼ z, then x ∼ z. (Transitive)
Deﬁnition 9.3.7 [x] denotes the set of all elements of S which are equivalent to x and [x]
is called the equivalence class determined by x or just the equivalence class of x.
Also recall the notion of equivalence classes.
Theorem 9.3.8 Let ∼ be an equivalence class deﬁned on a set S and let H denote the set
of equivalence classes. Then if [x] and [y] are two of these equivalence classes, either x ∼ y
and [x] = [y] or it is not true that x ∼ y and [x] ∩ [y] = ∅.
Theorem 9.3.9 In the vector space of n × n matrices, deﬁne
A∼B
if there exists an invertible matrix S such that
A = S −1 BS.
Then ∼ is an equivalence relation and A ∼ B if and only if whenever V is an n dimensional
vector space, there exists L ∈ L (V, V ) and bases {v1 , · · · , vn } and {w1 , · · · , wn } such that
A is the matrix of L with respect to {v1 , · · · , vn } and B is the matrix of L with respect to
{w1 , · · · , wn }.
Proof: A ∼ A because S = I works in the deﬁnition. If A ∼ B , then B ∼ A, because
A = S −1 BS
implies B = SAS −1 . If A ∼ B and B ∼ C, then
A = S −1 BS, B = T −1 CT
and so

−1

A = S −1 T −1 CT S = (T S)

CT S

which implies A ∼ C. This veriﬁes the ﬁrst part of the conclusion.
Now let V be an n dimensional vector space, A ∼ B so A = S −1 BS and pick a basis for
V,
β ≡ {v1 , · · · , vn }.
Deﬁne L ∈ L (V, V ) by
Lvi ≡

Then it follows that B is the matrix of L with respect to the basis
{qγ e1 , · · · , qγ en } ≡ {w1 , · · · , wn }.
That is, A and B are matrices of the same linear transformation L. Conversely, if A ∼ B,
let L be as just described. Thus L = qβ Aqβ−1 = qβ SBS −1 qβ−1 . Let qγ ≡ qβ S and it follows
that B is the matrix of L with respect to {qβ Se1 , · · · , qβ Sen }. 
What if the linear transformation consists of multiplication by a matrix A and you want
to ﬁnd the matrix of this linear transformation with respect to another basis? Is there an
easy way to do it? The next proposition considers this.

In simple language, to ﬁnd Lx, you multiply on the left of x by A. (A is the matrix of L
with respect to the standard basis.) Then the matrix M of this linear transformation with

from the above that

LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

Deﬁnition 9.3.11 An n × n matrix A, is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible n × n
matrix S such that S −1 AS = D, where D is a diagonal matrix. Thus D has zero entries
everywhere except on the main diagonal. Write diag (λ1 · · · , λn ) to denote the diagonal
matrix having the λi down the main diagonal.
The following theorem is of great signiﬁcance.
Theorem 9.3.12 Let A be an n × n matrix. Then A is diagonalizable if and only if Fn has
a basis of eigenvectors of A. In this case, S of Deﬁnition 9.3.11 consists of the n × n matrix
whose columns are the eigenvectors of A and D = diag (λ1 , · · · , λn ) .
Proof: Suppose ﬁrst that Fn has a basis of eigenvectors, {v1 

Then let S denote the matrix v1 · · · vn and let S −1 ≡  ...  where
{
uTi vj = δ ij ≡

uTn
1 if i = j

0 if i ̸= j

S −1 exists because S has rank n. Then from block multiplication,

Next suppose A is diagonalizable so S AS = D ≡ diag (λ1 , · · · , λn ) . Then the columns
of S form a basis because S −1 is given to exist. (It only remains) to verify that these
v1 · · · vn , AS = SD and so
columns
of S are eigenvectors.
But letting) S =
(

Av1 · · · Avn = λ1 v1 · · · λn vn which shows that Avi = λi vi . 
It makes sense to speak of the determinant of a linear transformation as described in the
following corollary.
Corollary 9.3.13 Let L ∈ L (V, V ) where V is an n dimensional vector space and let A be
the matrix of this linear transformation with respect to a basis on V. Then it is possible to
deﬁne
det (L) ≡ det (A) .
Proof: Each choice of basis for V determines a matrix for L with respect to the basis.
If A and B are two such matrices, it follows from Theorem 9.3.9 that
A = S −1 BS
and so
But

(

det (A) = det S −1 det (B) det (S) .

Deﬁnition 9.3.14 Let A ∈ L (X, Y ) where X and Y are ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces.
Deﬁne rank (A) to equal the dimension of A (X) .
The following theorem explains how the rank of A is related to the rank of the matrix
of A.
Theorem 9.3.15 Let A ∈ L (X, Y ). Then rank (A) = rank (M ) where M is the matrix of
A taken with respect to a pair of bases for the vector spaces X, and Y.

is linearly independent and so rank (A) ≤ rank (M ) . However, one could interchange the
roles of M and A in the above argument and thereby turn the inequality around. 
The following result is a summary of many concepts.
Theorem 9.3.16 Let L ∈ L (V, V ) where V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space. Then the
following are equivalent.
1. L is one to one.
2. L maps a basis to a basis.
3. L is onto.
4. det (L) ̸= 0
5. If Lv = 0 then v = 0.
∑n
n
Proof: Suppose
∑n ﬁrst L is one to one and let β = {vi }i=1 be a basis. Then if i=1 ci Lvi =
0 it follows L ( i=1
∑nci vi ) = 0 which means that since L (0) = 0, and L is one to one, it must
be the case that i=1 ci vi = 0. Since {vi } is a basis, each ci = 0 which shows {Lvi } is a
linearly independent set. Since there are n of these, it must be that this is a basis.
Now suppose 2.). Then letting {vi } ∑
be a basis, and y∑
∈ V, it follows from part 2.) that
n
n
there are constants, {ci } such that y = i=1 ci Lvi = L ( i=1 ci vi ) . Thus L is onto. It has
been shown that 2.) implies 3.).
Now suppose 3.). Then the operation consisting of multiplication by the matrix of L, [L],
must be onto. However, the vectors in Fn so obtained, consist of linear combinations of the
columns of [L] . Therefore, the column rank of [L] is n. By Theorem 3.3.23 this equals the
determinant rank and so det ([L]) ≡ det (L) ̸= 0.
Now assume 4.) If Lv = 0 for some v ̸= 0, it follows that [L] x = 0 for some x ̸= 0.
Therefore, the columns of [L] are linearly dependent and so by Theorem 3.3.23, det ([L]) =
det (L) = 0 contrary to 4.). Therefore, 4.) implies 5.).

LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

Now suppose 5.) and suppose Lv = Lw. Then L (v − w) = 0 and so by 5.), v − w = 0
showing that L is one to one. 
Also it is important to note that composition of linear transformations corresponds to
multiplication of the matrices. Consider the following diagram in which [A]γβ denotes the
matrix of A relative to the bases γ on Y and β on X, [B]δγ deﬁned similarly.

where A and B are two linear transformations, A ∈ L (X, Y ) and B ∈ L (Y, Z) . Then
B ◦ A ∈ L (X, Z) and so it has a matrix with respect to bases given on X and Z, the
coordinate maps for these bases being qβ and qδ respectively. Then
B ◦ A = qδ [B]δγ qγ qγ−1 [A]γβ qβ−1 = qδ [B]δγ [A]γβ qβ−1 .
But this shows that [B]δγ [A]γβ plays the role of [B ◦ A]δβ , the matrix of B ◦ A. Hence the
matrix of B ◦ A equals the product of the two matrices [A]γβ and [B]δγ . Of course it is
interesting to note that although [B ◦ A]δβ must be unique, the matrices, [A]γβ and [B]δγ
are not unique because they depend on γ, the basis chosen for Y .
Theorem 9.3.17 The matrix of the composition of linear transformations equals the product of the matrices of these linear transformations.

Some Geometrically Deﬁned Linear Transformations

If T is any linear transformation which maps Fn to Fm , there is always an m × n matrix
A ≡ [T ] with the property that
Ax = T x
(9.4)
for all x ∈ Fn . You simply take the matrix of the linear transformation with respect to the
standard basis. What is the form of A? Suppose T : Fn → Fm is a linear transformation
and you want to ﬁnd the matrix deﬁned by this linear transformation as described in (9.4).
Then if x ∈ Fn it follows
n
∑
x=
xi ei
i=1

where ei is the vector which has zeros in every slot but the ith and a 1 in this slot. Then
since T is linear,

and so you see that the matrix desired is obtained from letting the ith column equal T (ei ) .
This proves the following theorem.

Let Tθ+ϕ denote the linear transformation which rotates every vector through an angle
of θ + ϕ. Then to get Tθ+ϕ , you could ﬁrst do Tϕ and then do Tθ where Tϕ is the linear
transformation which rotates through an angle of ϕ and Tθ is the linear transformation
which rotates through an angle of θ. Denoting the corresponding matrices by Aθ+ϕ , Aϕ ,
and Aθ , you must have for every x
Aθ+ϕ x = Tθ+ϕ x = Tθ Tϕ x = Aθ Aϕ x.

In Physics it is important to consider the work done by a force ﬁeld on an object. This
involves the concept of projection onto a vector. Suppose you want to ﬁnd the projection
of a vector, v onto the given vector, u, denoted by proju (v) This is done using the dot
product as follows.
(v · u)
proju (v) =

Because of properties of the dot product, the map v → proju (v) is linear,

matrix of this linear transformation with respect to the usual basis.
You can ﬁnd this matrix in the same way as in earlier examples. proju (ei ) gives the ith
column of the desired matrix. Therefore, it is only necessary to ﬁnd
( e ·u )

Rotations About A Given Vector

As an application, I will consider the problem of rotating counter clockwise about a given
unit vector which is possibly not one of the unit vectors in coordinate directions. First
consider a pair of perpendicular unit vectors, u1 and u2 and the problem of rotating in the
counterclockwise direction about u3 where u3 = u1 × u2 so that u1 , u2 , u3 forms a right
handed orthogonal coordinate system. Thus the vector u3 is coming out of the page.

Let T denote the desired rotation. Then
T (au1 + bu2 + cu3 ) = aT u1 + bT u2 + cT u3
= (a cos θ − b sin θ) u1 + (a sin θ + b cos θ) u2 + cu3 .
Thus in terms of the basis γ ≡ {u1 , u2 , u3 } , the matrix of this transformation is

Suppose the unit vector u3 about which the counterclockwise rotation takes place is
(a, b, c). Then I obtain vectors, u1 and u2 such that {u1 , u2 , u3 } is a right handed orthonormal system with u3 = (a, b, c) and then use the above result. It is of course somewhat
arbitrary how this is accomplished. I will assume however, that |c| ̸= 1 since otherwise you
are looking at either clockwise or counter clockwise rotation about the positive z axis and
this is a problem which has been dealt with earlier. (If c = −1, it amounts to clockwise
rotation about the positive z axis while if c = 1, it is counter clockwise rotation about the
positive z axis.)
Then let u3 = (a, b, c) and u2 ≡ √a21+b2 (b, −a, 0) . This one is perpendicular to u3 . If
{u1 , u2 , u3 } is to be a right hand system it is necessary to have

With this, it is clear how to rotate clockwise about the unit vector, (a, b, c) . Just rotate
counter clockwise through an angle of −θ. Thus the matrix for this clockwise rotation is just

a2 + 1 − a2 cos θ

ac (1 − cos θ) + b sin θ bc (1 − cos θ) − a sin θ
c2 + 1 − c2 cos θ
In deriving (9.6) it was assumed that c ̸= ±1 but even in this case, it gives the correct
answer. Suppose for example that c = 1 so you are rotating in the counter clockwise
direction about the positive z axis. Then a, b are both equal to zero and (9.6) reduces to
(9.5).

The Euler Angles

An important application of the above theory is to the Euler angles, important in the
mechanics of rotating bodies. Lagrange studied these things back in the 1700’s. To describe

Next rotate counter clockwise about the x11 axis which results from the ﬁrst rotation through
an angle of θ. Thus it is desired to rotate counter clockwise through an angle θ about the
unit vector

Therefore, in (9.6), a = cos ϕ, b = sin ϕ, and c = 0. It follows the matrix of this transformation with respect to the usual basis is


cos2 ϕ + sin2 ϕ cos θ cos ϕ sin ϕ (1 − cos θ)

− sin ϕ sin θ
cos ϕ sin θ
cos θ
Finally, we rotate counter clockwise about the positive x23 axis by ψ. The vector in the
positive x13 axis is the same as the vector in the ﬁxed x3 axis. Thus the unit vector in the
positive direction of the x23 axis is

 
cos2 ϕ + sin2 ϕ cos θ cos ϕ sin ϕ (1 − cos θ)

− sin ϕ sin θ
− sin ϕ sin θ
and it is desired to rotate counter clockwise through an angle of ψ about this vector. Thus,
in this case,
a = cos2 ϕ + sin2 ϕ cos θ, b = cos ϕ sin ϕ (1 − cos θ) , c = − sin ϕ sin θ.
and you could substitute in to the formula of Theorem (9.6) and obtain a matrix which represents the linear transformation obtained by rotating counter clockwise about the positive
x23 axis, M3 (ϕ, θ, ψ) . Then what would be the matrix with respect to the usual basis for the

linear transformation which is obtained as a composition of the three just described? By
Theorem 9.3.17, this matrix equals the product of these three,
M3 (ϕ, θ, ψ) M2 (ϕ, θ) M1 (ϕ) .
I leave the details to you. There are procedures due to Lagrange which will allow you to

the motion of the spinning top shown in terms of these Euler angles.

Eigenvalues And Eigenvectors Of Linear Transformations

Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space. For example, it could be a subspace of Cn or Rn .
Also suppose A ∈ L (V, V ) .
Deﬁnition 9.4.1 The characteristic polynomial of A is deﬁned as q (λ) ≡ det (λI − A) .
The zeros of q (λ) in C are called the eigenvalues of A.
Lemma 9.4.2 When λ is an eigenvalue of A which is also in F, the ﬁeld of scalars, then
there exists v ̸= 0 such that Av = λv.
Proof: This follows from Theorem 9.3.16. Since λ ∈ F,
λI − A ∈ L (V, V )
and since it has zero determinant, it is not one to one. 
The following lemma gives the existence of something called the minimal polynomial.
Lemma 9.4.3 Let A ∈ L (V, V ) where V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space of dimension
n with arbitrary ﬁeld of scalars. Then there exists a unique polynomial of the form
p (λ) = λm + cm−1 λm−1 + · · · + c1 λ + c0

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/

9.4. EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS OF LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

241

such that p (A) = 0 and m is as small as possible for this to occur.
2

Proof: Consider the linear transformations, I, A, A2 , · · · , An . There are n2 + 1 of these
transformations and so by Theorem 9.2.3 the set is linearly dependent. Thus there exist
constants, ci ∈ F such that
n2
∑
c0 I +
ck Ak = 0.
k=1

This implies there exists a polynomial, q (λ) which has the property that q (A) = 0. In fact,
∑n2
one example is q (λ) ≡ c0 + k=1 ck λk . Dividing by the leading term, it can be assumed
this polynomial is of the form λm + cm−1 λm−1 + · · · + c1 λ + c0 , a monic polynomial. Now
consider all such monic polynomials, q such that q (A) = 0 and pick the one which has the
smallest degree m. This is called the minimal polynomial and will be denoted here by p (λ) .
If there were two minimal polynomials, the one just found and another,
λm + dm−1 λm−1 + · · · + d1 λ + d0 .
Then subtracting these would give the following polynomial,
q ′ (λ) = (dm−1 − cm−1 ) λm−1 + · · · + (d1 − c1 ) λ + d0 − c0
Since q ′ (A) = 0, this requires each dk = ck since otherwise you could divide by dk − ck
where k is the largest one which is nonzero. Thus the choice of m would be contradicted. 
Theorem 9.4.4 Let V be a nonzero ﬁnite dimensional vector space of dimension n with
the ﬁeld of scalars equal to F. Suppose A ∈ L (V, V ) and for p (λ) the minimal polynomial
deﬁned above, let µ ∈ F be a zero of this polynomial. Then there exists v ̸= 0,v ∈ V such
that
Av = µv.
If F = C, then A always has an eigenvector and eigenvalue. Furthermore, if {λ1 , · · · , λm }
are the zeros of p (λ) in F, these are exactly the eigenvalues of A for which there exists an
eigenvector in V.
Proof: Suppose ﬁrst µ is a zero of p (λ) . Since p (µ) = 0, it follows
p (λ) = (λ − µ) k (λ)
where k (λ) is a polynomial having coeﬃcients in F. Since p has minimal degree, k (A) ̸= 0
and so there exists a vector, u ̸= 0 such that k (A) u ≡ v ̸= 0. But then
(A − µI) v = (A − µI) k (A) (u) = 0.
The next claim about the existence of an eigenvalue follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra and what was just shown.
It has been shown that every zero of p (λ) is an eigenvalue which has an eigenvector in
V . Now suppose µ is an eigenvalue which has an eigenvector in V so that Av = µv for some
v ∈ V, v ̸= 0. Does it follow µ is a zero of p (λ)?
0 = p (A) v = p (µ) v
and so µ is indeed a zero of p (λ). 
In summary, the theorem says that the eigenvalues which have eigenvectors in V are
exactly the zeros of the minimal polynomial which are in the ﬁeld of scalars F.

over a ﬁeld F. Suppose also that ker (A) and A (ker (BA)) are ﬁnite dimensional subspaces.
Then
dim (ker (BA)) ≤ dim (ker (B)) + dim (ker (A)) .

LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS CANONICAL FORMS

Direct Sums, Block Diagonal Matrices

Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space with ﬁeld of scalars F. Here I will make no
assumption on F. Also suppose A ∈ L (V, V ) .
Recall Lemma 9.4.3 which gives the existence of the minimal polynomial for a linear
transformation A. This is the monic polynomial p which has smallest possible degree such
that p(A) = 0. It is stated again for convenience.
Lemma 10.2.1 Let A ∈ L (V, V ) where V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space of dimension
n with ﬁeld of scalars F. Then there exists a unique monic polynomial of the form
p (λ) = λm + cm−1 λm−1 + · · · + c1 λ + c0
such that p (A) = 0 and m is as small as possible for this to occur.
Now here is a useful lemma which will be used below.
Lemma 10.2.2 Let L ∈ L (V, V ) where V is an n dimensional vector space. Then if L
is one to one, it follows that L is also onto. In fact, if {v1 , · · · , vn } is a basis, then so is
{Lv1 , · · · , Lvn }.
Proof: Let {v1 , · · · , vn } be a basis for V . Then I claim that {Lv1 , · · · , Lvn } is also a
basis for V . First of all, I show {Lv1 , · · · , Lvn } is linearly independent. Suppose

and since L is one to one, it follows

ck vk = 0

which implies each ck = 0. Therefore, {Lv1 , · · · , Lvn } is linearly independent. If there
exists w not in the span of these vectors, then by Lemma 8.2.10, {Lv1 , · · · , Lvn , w} would
be independent and this contradicts the exchange theorem, Theorem 8.2.4 because it would
be a linearly independent set having more vectors than the spanning set {v1 , · · · , vn } . 
Now it is time to consider the notion of a direct sum of subspaces. Recall you can
always assert the existence of a factorization of the minimal polynomial into a product of
irreducible polynomials. This fact will now be used to show how to obtain such a direct
sum of subspaces.

Note that if one of these polynomials (ϕk (λ))rk is a monic linear polynomial, then the generalized eigenspace would be an eigenspace.

Proof: It is clear Vk is a subspace which is A invariant because A commutes with

ϕk (A) k . It is clear the operators ϕk (A) k commute. Thus if v ∈ Vk ,

v = ϕl (A) l 0 = 0

r

and so ϕl (A) l : Vk → Vk .
I claim ϕl (A) is one to one on Vk whenever k ̸= l. The two polynomials ϕl (λ) and
r
ϕk (λ) k are relatively prime so there exist polynomials m (λ) , n (λ) such that
rk

m (λ) ϕl (λ) + n (λ) ϕk (λ)

=1

It follows that the sum of all coeﬃcients of λ raised to a positive power are zero and the
constant term on the left is 1. Therefore, using the convention A0 = I it follows
rk

=I

rk

v=v

m (A) ϕl (A) + n (A) ϕk (A)
If v ∈ Vk , then from the above,
m (A) ϕl (A) v + n (A) ϕk (A)
Since v is in Vk , it follows by deﬁnition,
m (A) ϕl (A) v = v

r

and so ϕl (A) v ̸= 0 unless v = 0. Thus ϕl (A) and ∏
hence ϕl (A) l is one to one on Vk for
q
r
every k ̸= l. By Lemma 10.1.6 and the fact that ker ( k=1 ϕk (λ) k ) = V, (10.2) is obtained.
The claim about the bases follows from Lemma 10.1.5. 
You could consider the restriction of A to Vk . It turns out that this restriction has
m

Corollary 10.2.5 Let the minimal polynomial of A be p (λ) = k=1 ϕk (λ) k where each
mk
ϕk is irreducible. Let Vk = ker (ϕ (A) ) . Then
V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vq = V
and letting Ak denote the restriction of A to Vk , it follows the minimal polynomial of Ak is
m
ϕk (λ) k .
m

the direct sum, V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vq = V where Vk = ker (ϕk (A) k ) for p (λ) =
∏q Proof: Recall
mk
the minimal polynomial for A where the ϕk (λ) are all irreducible. Thus each
k=1 ϕk (λ)
Vk is invariant with respect to A. What is the minimal polynomial of Ak , the restriction of
m
A to Vk ? First note that ϕk (Ak ) k (Vk ) = {0} by deﬁnition. Thus if η (λ) is the minimal
m
r
polynomial for Ak then it must divide ϕk (λ) k and so by Corollary 8.3.11 η (λ) = ϕk (λ) k
where rk ≤ mk . Could rk < mk ? No, this is not possible because then p (λ) would fail
m
to be the minimal polynomial for A. You could substitute for the term ϕk (λ) k in the
rk
′
factorization of p (λ) with ϕk (λ) and the resulting polynomial p would satisfy p′ (A) = 0.
Here is why. From Theorem 10.2.4, a typical x ∈ V is of the form

How does Theorem 10.2.4 relate to matrices?
Theorem 10.2.6 Suppose V is a vector space with ﬁeld of scalars F and A ∈ L (V, V ).
Suppose also
V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vq
where each Vk is A invariant. (AVk ⊆ Vk ) Also let β k be a basis for Vk and let Ak denote
the restriction of A to Vk . Letting M k denote the{ matrix of }

follows the matrix of A with respect to the basis β 1 , · · · , β q is

An examination of the proof of the above theorem yields the following corollary.
while

Corollary 10.2.7 If any β k in the above consists of eigenvectors, then M k is a diagonal
matrix having the corresponding eigenvalues down the diagonal.
It follows that it would be interesting to consider special bases for the vector spaces in
the direct sum. This leads to the Jordan form or more generally other canonical forms such
as the rational canonical form.

Lemma 10.3.2 Let W be an A invariant (AW ⊆ W ) subspace of ker (ϕ (A) ) for m a
positive integer where ϕ (λ) is an irreducible monic polynomial of degree d. Then if η (λ) is
a monic polynomial of smallest degree such that for
m

x ∈ ker (ϕ (A) ) \ {0} ,
η (A) x = 0,
then
k

η (λ) = ϕ (λ)

for some positive integer k. Thus if r is the degree of η, then r = kd. Also, for a cyclic set,
{
}
β x ≡ x, Ax, · · · , Ar−1 x
r
is linearly
independent.
{
} Recall that r is the smallest such that A x is a linear combination
r−1
of x, Ax, · · · , A x .
Now let U be an A invariant subspace of ker (ϕ (A)) .
If {v1 , · · · , vs } is a basis for W then if x ∈ U \ W,

{v1 , · · · , vs , β x }
is linearly independent.
There exist vectors x1 , · · · , xp each in U such that
{
}
v1 , · · · , vs , β x1 , · · · , β xp
is a basis for
U + W.
Proof: Consider the ﬁrst claim. If η (A) x = 0, then writing
m

ϕ (λ)

= η (λ) g (λ) + r (λ)

where either r (λ) = 0 or the degree of r (λ) is less than that of η (λ) , the latter possibility
cannot occur because if it did, r (A) x = 0 and this would contradict the deﬁnition of η (λ).
m
Therefore r (λ) = 0 and so η (λ) divides ϕ (λ) . From Corollary 8.3.11,
k

η (λ) = ϕ (λ)

for some integer, k ≤ m. Since x ̸= 0, it follows k > 0. In particular, the degree of η (λ)
equals kd.
m
Now consider x ̸= 0, x ∈ ker (ϕ (A) ){ and the vectors β x . Do
} these vectors yield a
linearly independent set? The vectors are x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Ar−1 x where Ar x is in
(
)
span x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Ar−1 x
and r is as small as possible for this to happen. Suppose then that there are scalars dj , not
all zero such that
r−1
∑
dj Aj x = 0, x ̸= 0.
(10.3)
j=0

Suppose m is the largest nonzero scalar in the above linear combination. dm ̸= 0, m ≤ r − 1.
Then Am x is a linear combination of the preceeding vectors in the list, which contradicts
the deﬁnition of r. Thus from the ﬁrst part, r = kd for some positive integer k.

Since β x is independent for each x ̸= 0, it follows that whenever x ̸= 0,
{
}
x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Ad−1 x
is linearly independent because, the length of β x is a multiple of d and is therefore, at least
as long as the above list. However, if x ∈ ker (ϕ (A)) , then β x is equal to the above list.
This is because ϕ (λ) is of degree d so β x is no longer than the above list. However, from
the ﬁrst part β x has length equal to kd for some integer k so it is at least as long.
Suppose now x ∈ U \ W where U ⊆ ker (ϕ (A)). Consider
{
}
v1 , · · · , vs , x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Ad−1 x .
Is this set of vectors independent? First note that
(
)
span x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Ad−1 x
{
}
is A invariant because, from what was just shown, x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Ad−1 x = β x and so
Ad x is a linear combination of the other vectors in the above list. Suppose now that

(

Am z ∈ W ∩ span x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x
(

because W, span x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x are A invariant, and so
(

span z, Az, · · · , Ad−1 z

(

(

⊆ span x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x
(10.4)
{

Suppose z =
̸ 0. Then from the above, z, Az, · · · , Ad−1 z must be linearly independent.
Therefore,
(

(
(

d = dim span z, Az, · · · , Ad−1 z ≤ dim W ∩ span x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x

Thus

(
)
(
)
span z, Az, · · · , Ad−1 z ⊆ span x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x

and both have the same dimension and so the two sets are equal. It follows from (10.4)
(
)
(
)
W ∩ span x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x = span x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x
which would require x ∈ W but this is assumed not to take place. Hence z = 0 and so the
linearly
independence}of the {v1 , · · · , vs } implies each ai = 0. Then the linear independence
{
of x,{Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x which follows
} from the ﬁrst part of the argument shows each dj = 0.
Thus v1 , · · · , vs , x, Ax, · · · , Ad−1 x is linearly independent as claimed.
Let x ∈ U \ W ⊆ ker (ϕ (A))
{ . Then it was just shown
} that {v1 , · · · , vs , β x } is linearly

Nilpotent Transformations

Deﬁnition 10.4.1 Let V be a vector space over the ﬁeld of scalars F. Then N ∈ L (V, V )
is called nilpotent if for some m, it follows that N m = 0.
The following lemma contains some signiﬁcant observations about nilpotent transformations.
{
}
Lemma 10.4.2 Suppose N k x ̸= 0. Then x, N x, · · · , N k x is linearly independent. Also,
the minimal polynomial of N is λm where m is the ﬁrst such that N m = 0.
∑k
Proof: Suppose i=0 ci N i x = 0. There exists l such that k ≤ l < m and N l+1 x = 0
but N l x ̸= 0. Then multiply both sides by N l to conclude that c0 = 0. Next multiply both
sides by N l−1 to conclude that c1 = 0 and continue this way to obtain that all the ci = 0.
Next consider the claim that λm is the minimal polynomial. If p (λ) is the minimal
polynomial, then
p (λ) = λm l (λ) + r (λ)
where the degree of r (λ) is less than m or else r (λ) = 0. Suppose the degree of r (λ) is less
than m. Then you would have
0 = 0 + r (N ) .
If r (λ) = a0 + a1 λ + · · · + as λs for s ≤ m − 1, as ̸= 0, then for any x ∈ V,
0 = a0 x + a1 N x + · · · + as N s x
If for some x, N s x ̸= 0, then from the ﬁrst part of the argument, the above equation could
not hold. Hence N s x = 0 for all x and so N s = 0 for some s < m, a contradiction to the
choice of m. It follows that r (λ) = 0 and so p (λ) cannot be the minimal polynomial unless
l (λ) = 1. Hence p (λ) = λm as claimed.  {
}
For such a nilpotent transformation, let β x1 , · · · , β xq be a basis for ker (N m ) = V
where these β xi are cyclic. This basis exists thanks to Theorem 10.3.4. Thus
(
)
(
)
V = span β x1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ span β xq ,
each of these subspaces in the above direct sum being N invariant. For x one of the xk ,
consider β x given by
x, N x, N 2 x, · · · , N r−1 x
where N r x is in the span of the above vectors. Then by the above lemma, N r x = 0.

In fact, the matrix of the above proposition is unique.
Corollary 10.4.5 Let J, J ′ both be matrices of the nilpotent linear transformation N ∈
L (W, W ) which are of the form described in Proposition 10.4.4. Then J = J ′ . In fact, if
the rank of J k equals the rank of J ′k for all nonnegative integers k, then J = J ′ .

similar. Hence, for each k, these matrices have the same rank. Now suppose J ̸= J ′ . Note
ﬁrst that

Denote the blocks of J as Jrk (0) and the blocks of J ′ as Jrk′ (0). Let k be the ﬁrst such that

it follows that the two matrices J rk −1 and J ′rk −1 are respectively of the forms

The Jordan Canonical Form

The Jordan canonical form has to do with the case where the minimal polynomial of A ∈
L (V, V ) splits. Thus there exist λk in the ﬁeld of scalars such that the minimal polynomial
of A is of the form

Proposition 10.5.1 Let the minimal polynomial of A ∈ L (V, V ) be given by
p (λ) =

Then the eigenvalues of A are {λ1 , · · · , λr }.
It follows from Corollary 10.2.4 that
V

⊕ · · · ⊕ ker (A − λr I)

where I denotes the identity linear transformation. Without loss of generality, let the
dimensions of the Vk be decreasing from left to right. These Vk are called the generalized
eigenspaces.
It follows from the deﬁnition of Vk that (A − λk I) is nilpotent on Vk and clearly each
Vk is A invariant. Therefore from Proposition 10.4.4, and letting Ak denote the restriction
of A to Vk , there exists an ordered basis for Vk , β k such that with respect to this basis, the
matrix of (Ak − λk I) is of the form given in that proposition, denoted here by J k . What is
the matrix of Ak with respect to β k ? Letting {b1 , · · · , br } = β k ,

and so the matrix of Ak with respect to this basis is

where I is the identity matrix. Therefore, with respect to the ordered basis {β 1 , · · · , β r }
the matrix of A is in Jordan canonical form. This means the matrix is of the form

which has no rank. You see, discrepancies occur in the rank upon raising to higher powers
if the blocks are not the same. Now with this preparation, here is the main theorem.
Theorem 10.5.2 Let V be an n dimensional vector space with ﬁeld of scalars C or some
other ﬁeld such that the minimal polynomial of A ∈ L (V, V ) completely factors into powers
of linear factors. Then there exists a unique Jordan canonical form for A as described in
(10.5) - (10.7), where uniqueness is in the sense that any two have the same number and
size of Jordan blocks.
Proof: It only remains to verify uniqueness. Suppose there are two, J and J ′ . Then these
are matrices of A with respect to possibly diﬀerent bases and so they are similar. Therefore,
they have the same minimal polynomials and the generalized eigenspaces have the same
dimension. Thus the size of the matrices J (λk ) and J ′ (λk ) deﬁned by the dimension of
these generalized eigenspaces, also corresponding to the algebraic multiplicity of λk , must
be the same. Therefore, they comprise the same set of positive integers. Thus listing the
eigenvalues in the same order, corresponding blocks J (λk ) , J ′ (λk ) are the same size.
It remains to show that J (λk ) and J ′ (λk ) are not just the same size but also are the
same up to order of the Jordan blocks running down their respective diagonals. It is only
necessary to worry about the number and size of the Jordan blocks making up J (λk ) and
J ′ (λk ) . Since J, J ′ are similar, so are J − λk I and J ′ − λk I. Thus the following two matrices
are similar

and consequently, rank Ak = rank B k for all k ∈ N. Also, both J (λj ) − λk I and

Note that if any of the generalized eigenspaces ker (A − λk I) k has a basis of eigenvectors, then it would be possible to use this basis and obtain a diagonal matrix in the
block corresponding to λk . By uniqueness, this is the block corresponding to the eigenvalue
λk . Thus when this happens, the block in the Jordan canonical form corresponding to λk
is just the diagonal matrix having λk down the diagonal and there are no generalized
eigenvectors.
The Jordan canonical form is very signiﬁcant when you try to understand powers of a
matrix. There exists an n × n matrix S 1 such that
A = S −1 JS.
Therefore, A2 = S −1 JSS −1 JS = S −1 J 2 S and continuing this way, it follows
Ak = S −1 J k S.

Proposition 10.7.2 Let q (λ) be a polynomial and let C (q (λ)) be its companion matrix.
Then q (C (q (λ))) = 0.
Proof: Write C instead of C (q (λ)) for short. Note that
Ce1 = e2 , Ce2 = e3 , · · · , Cen−1 = en
Thus
and so it follows

ek = C k−1 e1 , k = 1, · · · , n

(10.11)

{

e1 , Ce1 , C 2 e1 , · · · , C n−1 e1

(10.12)

are linearly independent. Hence these form a basis for F . Now note that Cen is given by
n

Cen = −a0 e1 − a1 e2 − · · · − an−1 en
and from (10.11) this implies
C n e1 = −a0 e1 − a1 Ce1 − · · · − an−1 C n−1 e1
and so
q (C) e1 = 0.
Now since (10.12) is a basis, every vector of Fn is of the form k (C) e1 for some polynomial
k (λ). Therefore, if v ∈ Fn ,
q (C) v = q (C) k (C) e1 = k (C) q (C) e1 = 0
which shows q (C) = 0. 

Uniqueness

Given A ∈ L (V, V ) where V is a vector space having ﬁeld of scalars F, the above shows
there exists a rational canonical form for A. Could A have more than one rational canonical
form? Recall the deﬁnition of an A cyclic set. For convenience, here it is again.
{
}
Deﬁnition 10.8.1 Letting x ̸= 0 denote by
β x the vectors) x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Am−1 x where
(
m is the smallest such that Am x ∈ span x, · · · , Am−1 x . This is called an A cyclic set,
denoted by β x .
The following proposition ties these A cyclic sets to polynomials. It is just a review of
ideas used above to prove existence.
{
}
Proposition 10.8.2 Let x ̸= 0 and consider x, Ax, A2 x, · · · , Am−1 x . Then this is an
A cyclic set if and only if there exists a monic polynomial η (λ) such that η (A) x = 0 and
among all such polynomials ψ (λ) satisfying ψ (A) x = 0, η (λ) has the smallest degree. If
m
V = ker (ϕ (λ) ) where ϕ (λ) is irreducible, then for some positive integer p ≤ m, η (λ) =
p
ϕ (λ) .
m

Lemma 10.8.3 Let V be a vector space and A ∈ L (V, V ) has minimal polynomial
ϕ (λ) }
{
where ϕ (λ) is irreducible and has degree d. Let the basis for V consist of β v1 , · · · , β vs
where β vk is A cyclic as described above and the rational canonical form for A is the matrix
taken with respect to this basis. Then letting β vk denote the number of vectors in β vk , it
follows there is only one possible set of numbers β vk .
p

Proof: Say β vj is associated with the polynomial ϕ (λ) j . Thus, as described above
β vj equals pj d. Consider the following table which comes from the A cyclic set
{

p −1

In the above, αjk signiﬁes the vectors below it in the k th column. None of these vectors
p −1
below the top row are equal to 0 because the degree of ϕ (λ) j λd−1 is dpj − 1, which is
less than pj d and the smallest degree of a nonzero polynomial sending vj to 0 is pj d. Also,
each of these vectors is in the span of β vj and there are dpj of them, just as there are dpj
vectors in β vj .
{
}
Claim: The vectors αj0 , · · · , αjd−1 are linearly independent.
Proof of claim: Suppose

Then multiplying both sides by ϕ (A)
d−1
∑

pj −1

this yields
pj −1

ci0 ϕ (A)

Ai vj = 0

i=0

Now if any of the ci0 is nonzero this would imply there exists a polynomial having degree
smaller than pj d which sends vj to 0. Since this does not happen, it follows each ci0 = 0.
Thus
j −1
d−1 p∑
∑
k
cik ϕ (A) Ai vj = 0
i=0 k=1
p −2

Now multiply both sides by ϕ (A) j and do a similar argument to assert that ci1 = 0 for
each i. Continuing this
{ way, all the c}ik = 0 and this proves the claim.
Thus the vectors αj0 , · · · , αjd−1 are linearly independent and there are pj d = β vj
( )
of them. Therefore, they form a basis for span β vj . Also note that if you list the
columns
in reverse
order starting from the bottom and going toward the top, the vectors
{
}
j
j
α0 , · · · , αd−1 yield Jordan blocks in the matrix of ϕ (A). Hence, considering all these
}s
{
listed in the reverse order, the matrix of ϕ (A) with respect to
vectors αj0 , · · · , αjd−1
j=1

this basis of V is in Jordan canonical form. See Proposition 10.4.4 and Theorem 10.5.2 on
existence and uniqueness for
{ the Jordan}form. This Jordan form is unique up to order of
the blocks. For a given j αj0 , · · · , αjd−1 yields d Jordan blocks of size pj for ϕ (A). The
size and number of Jordan blocks of ϕ (A) depends only on ϕ (A) , hence only on A. Once
A is determined, ϕ (A) is determined and hence the number and size of Jordan blocks is
determined so the exponents pj are determined and this shows the lengths of the β vj , pj d
are also determined. 
Note that if the pj are known, then so is the rational canonical form because it comes
p
from blocks which are companion matrices of the polynomials ϕ (λ) j . Now here is the main
result.
Theorem 10.8.4 Let V be a vector space having ﬁeld of scalars F and let A ∈ L (V, V ).
Then the rational canonical form of A is unique up to order of the blocks.
∏q
m
Proof: Let the minimal polynomial of A be k=1 ϕk (λ) k . Then recall from Corollary
10.2.4
V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vq
m

where Vk = ker (ϕk (A) k ) . Also recall from Corollary 10.2.5 that the minimal polynomial
m
of the restriction of A to Vk is ϕk (λ) k . Now apply Lemma 10.8.3 to A restricted to Vk . 
In the case where two n × n matrices M, N are similar, recall this is equivalent to the
two being matrices of the same linear transformation taken with respect to two diﬀerent
bases. Hence each are similar to the same rational canonical form.

The characteristic polynomial is λ3 − 24λ2 + 180λ − 432. This factors as

there is a much better way which is described in the exercises. Leaving out this detail, the

because the next vector involving A2 yields a vector which is in the span of the above two.
You check this by making the vectors the columns of a matrix and ﬁnding the row reduced

for the polynomial λ2 −8λ+32 and the 1×1 block being a companion matrix for λ−4. Note
that you could have written this without ﬁnding a similarity transformation to produce it.
This follows from the above theory which gave the existence of the rational canonical form.
Obviously there is a lot more which could be considered about rational canonical forms.
Just begin with a strange ﬁeld and start investigating what can be said. It is as far as I
feel like going on this subject at this time. One can also derive more systematic methods
for ﬁnding the rational canonical form. The advantage of this is you don’t need to ﬁnd the
eigenvalues in order to compute the rational canonical form and it can often be computed
for this reason, unlike the Jordan form. The uniqueness of this rational canonical form can
be used to determine whether two matrices consisting of entries in some ﬁeld are similar.

basis β x1 , β x2 , · · · , β xr , the vectors in each β xi listed according to increasing power
of A, thus obtaining an ordered basis (q1 , · · · , qn ) . Letting Q be the unitary matrix

Bij = 0 if i − j ≥ 2. Such a matrix is called an upper Hessenberg matrix and this

polynomial over F. Next consider the proof of Lemma 10.8.3 and show that they have
the same rational canonical form with respect to F.

The existence of the Jordan form is the basis for the proof of limit theorems for certain

some power of A has all entries strictly positive. A vector, v ∈ Rn , is a steady state if
Av = v.
Lemma 11.1.2 The property of being a stochastic matrix is preserved by taking products.

Here aij denotes the ij entry of A . Also, if λ = 1 has algebraic multiplicity r, then

which N r = 0. I will show that because of Condition 2, N = 0.
First of all,
Jri (λi ) = λi I + Ni
where Ni satisﬁes Niri = 0 for some ri > 0. It is clear that Ni (λi I) = (λi I) N and so

Are there examples which will cause the eigenvalue condition of this theorem to hold?
The following lemma gives such a condition. It turns out that if aij > 0, not just ≥ 0, then
the eigenvalue condition of the above theorem is valid.
Lemma 11.1.4 Suppose A = (aij ) is a stochastic matrix. Then λ = 1 is an eigenvalue. If
aij > 0 for all i, j, then if µ is an eigenvalue of A, either |µ| < 1 or µ = 1. In addition to
this, if Av = v for a nonzero vector, v ∈ Rn , then vj vi ≥ 0 for all i, j so the components of
v have the same sign.
Proof: Suppose the matrix satisﬁes

∑

aij = 1.

j

(
)T
Then if v = 1 · · · 1
, it is obvious that Av = v. Therefore, this matrix has λ = 1
as an eigenvalue. Suppose then that µ is an eigenvalue. Is |µ| < 1 or µ = 1? Let v be an
eigenvector and let |vi | be the largest of the |vj | .
∑
µvi =
aij vj
j

and now multiply both sides by µvi to obtain

|µ| |vi | =
aij Re (vj vi µ)
aij vj vi µ =

∑

aij |µ| |vi | = |µ| |vi |

j

Therefore, |µ| ≤ 1. If |µ| = 1, then equality must hold in the above, and so vj vi µ must be
real and nonnegative for each j. In particular, this holds for j = 1 which shows µ and hence
µ are real. Thus,
∑ in this case, µ = 1. The only other case is where |µ| < 1.
If instead, i aij = 1, consider AT . Both A and AT have the same characteristic polynomial and so their eigenvalues are exactly the same. 

∑ A be any Markov matrix and let v be a vector having all its components

The following theorem about limits is now easy to obtain.
Theorem 11.1.6 Suppose A is a Markov matrix (The sum over a column equals 1) in
which aij > 0 for all i, j and suppose w is a vector. Then for each i,
(
)
lim Ak w i = vi

where Av = v. In words, Ak w always converges
to a steady state. In addition to this, if

the vector, w satisﬁes
w

for
all

and
i i
∑ i
conditions, vi ≥ 0, i vi = c.
Proof: By Lemma 11.1.4, since each aij > 0, the eigenvalues are either 1 or have absolute
value less than 1. Therefore, the claimed limit exists by Theorem 11.1.3. The assertion that
the components are nonnegative and sum to c follows from Lemma 11.1.5. That Av = v
follows from
v = lim An w = lim An+1 w = A lim An w = Av. 
n→∞

n→∞

n→∞

It is not hard to generalize the conclusion of this theorem to regular Markov processes.
Corollary 11.1.7 Suppose A is a regular Markov matrix, on for which the entries of Ak
are all positive for some k, and suppose w is a vector. Then for each i,
lim (An w)i = vi

n→∞

where Av = v. In words, An w always converges
to a steady state. In addition to this, if
∑
the vector w satisﬁes
w
≥
0
for
all
i
and
w
=
c, Then the vector v will also satisfy the
i i
∑ i
conditions vi ≥ 0, i vi = c.
Proof: Let the entries of Ak be all positive. Now suppose that aij ≥ 0 for all i, j and
A = (aij ) is a transition matrix. Then if B = (bij ) is a transition matrix with bij > 0 for
all ij, it follows that BA is a transition matrix which has strictly positive entries. The ij th
entry of BA is
∑
bik akj > 0,
k
k

Thus, from Lemma 11.1.4, A has an eigenvalue equal to 1 for all k suﬃciently large, and
all the other eigenvalues have absolute value strictly less than 1. The same must be true of
A, for if λ is an eigenvalue of A with |λ| = 1, then λk is an eigenvalue for Ak and so, for
all k large enough, λk = 1 which is absurd unless λ = 1. By Theorem 11.1.3, limn→∞ An w
exists. The rest follows as in Theorem 11.1.6. 

Migration Matrices

Deﬁnition 11.2.1 Let n locations be denoted by the numbers 1, 2, · · · , n. Also suppose it is
the case that each year aij denotes the proportion of residents in location j which move to
location i. Also suppose
∑ no one escapes or emigrates from without these n locations. This last
assumption requires i aij = 1. Thus (aij ) is a Markov matrix referred to as a migration
matrix.
T

If v = (x1 , · · · , xn ) where xi is the population of location
∑ i at a given instant, you obtain
the population of location i one year later by computing j aij xj = (Av)i . Therefore, the
(
)
population of location i after k years is Ak v i . Furthermore, Corollary 11.1.7 can be used
to predict in the case where A is regular what the long time population will be for the given
locations.
As an example of the above, consider the case where n = 3 and the migration matrix is
of the form


.6 0 .1
 .2 .8 0  .
.2 .2 .9
Now


2 
. 38 .0 2 . 15
.6 0 .1
 .2 .8 0  =  . 28 . 64 .0 2 
. 34 . 34 . 83
.2 .2 .9
(
)
and so the Markov matrix is regular. Therefore, Ak v i will converge to the ith component
of a steady state. It follows the steady state can be obtained from solving the system


. 6x + . 1z = x
. 2x + . 8y = y
. 2x + . 2y + . 9z = z
along with the stipulation that the sum of x, y, and z must equal the constant value present
at the beginning of the process. The solution to this system is
{y = x, z = 4x, x = x} .
If the total population at the beginning is 150,000, then you solve the following system
y=x
z = 4x
x + y + z = 150000
whose solution is easily seen to be {x = 25 000, z = 100 000, y = 25 000} . Thus, after a long
time there would be about four times as many people in the third location as in either of
the other two.

11.3

Markov Chains

A random variable is just a function which can have certain values which have probabilities
associated with them. Thus it makes sense to consider the probability that the random
variable has a certain value or is in some set. The idea of a Markov chain is a sequence of
random variables, {Xn } which can be in any of a collection of states which can be labeled
with nonnegative integers. Thus you can speak of the probability the random variable, Xn

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/

280

MARKOV CHAINS AND MIGRATION PROCESSES

is in state i. The probability that Xn+1 is in state j given that Xn is in state i is called
a one step transition probability. When this probability does not depend on n it is called
stationary and this is the case of interest here. Since this probability does not depend on n
it can be denoted by pij . Here is a simple example called a random walk.
Example 11.3.1 Let there be n points, xi , and consider a process of something moving
randomly from one point to another. Suppose Xn is a sequence of random variables which
has values {1, 2, · · · , n} where Xn = i indicates the process has arrived at the ith point. Let
pij be the probability that Xn+1 has the value j∑given that Xn has the value i. Since Xn+1
must have some value, it must be the case that j aij = 1. Note this says that the sum over
a row equals 1 and so the situation is a little diﬀerent than the above in which the sum was
over a column.
As an example, let x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 be four points taken in order on R and suppose x1
and x4 are absorbing. This means that p4k = 0 for all k ̸= 4 and p1k = 0 for all k ̸= 1.
Otherwise, you can move either to the left or to the right with probability 21 . The Markov
matrix associated with this situation is


1 0 0 0
 .5 0 .5 0 


 0 .5 0 .5  .
0 0 0 1
Deﬁnition 11.3.2 Let the stationary transition probabilities, pij be deﬁned above. The
resulting matrix having pij as its ij th entry is called the matrix of transition probabilities.
The sequence of random variables for which these pij are the transition probabilities is called
a Markov chain. The matrix of transition probabilities is called a stochastic matrix.
The next proposition is fundamental and shows the signiﬁcance of the powers of the
matrix of transition probabilities.
Proposition 11.3.3 Let pnij denote the probability that Xn is in state j given that X0 was
in state i. Then pnij is the ij th entry of the matrix P n where P = (pij ) .
Proof: This is clearly true if n = 1 and follows from the deﬁnition of the pij .∑Suppose
true for n. Then the probability that Xn+1 is at j given that X0 was at i equals k pnik pkj
because Xn must have some value, k, and so this represents all possible ways to go from i
to j. You can go from i to 1 in n steps with probability pi1 and then from 1 to j in one step
with probability p1j and so the probability of this is pni1 p1j but you can also go from i to 2
and then from 2 to j and from i to 3 and then from 3 to j etc. Thus the sum of these is
just what is given and represents the probability of Xn+1 having the value j given X0 has
the value i. 
In the above random walk example, lets take a power of the transition probability matrix
to determine what happens. Rounding oﬀ to two decimal places,

After many iterations of the process, if you start at 2 you will end up at 1 with probability
2/3 and at 4 with probability 1/3. This makes good intuitive sense because it is twice as far
from 2 to 4 as it is from 2 to 1.

showing {|vk |}k=1 is an increasing sequence. Now a contradiction results on the last line

Example 11.3.6 In the gambler’s ruin problem a gambler plays a game with someone, say
a casino, until he either wins all the other’s money or loses all of his own. A simple version
of this is as follows. Let Xk denote the amount of money the gambler has. Each time the
game is played he wins with probability p ∈ (0, 1) or loses with probability (1 − p) ≡ q. In
case he wins, his money increases to Xk + 1 and if he loses, his money decreases to Xk − 1.

Here the matrix is b + 1 × b + 1 because the possible values of Xk are all integers from 0 up
to b. The 1 in the upper left corner corresponds to the gambler’s ruin. It involves Xk = 0
so he has no money left. Once this state has been reached, it is not possible to ever leave
it. This is indicated by the row of zeros to the right of this entry the k th of which gives the
probability of going from state 1 corresponding to no money to state k 1 .
In this case 1 is a repeated root of the characteristic equation of multiplicity 2 and all
the other eigenvalues have absolute value less than 1. To see that this is the case, note that
the characteristic polynomial is of the form

Therefore, by Theorem 11.1.3 limn→∞ P n exists. The case of limn→∞ pnj0 is particularly
interesting because it gives the probability that, starting with an amount j, the gambler
eventually ends up at 0 and is ruined. From the matrix, it follows
pnj0

n−1
= qpn−1
(j−1)0 + pp(j+1)0 for j ∈ [1, b − 1] ,

pn00

1, and pnb0 = 0.

To simplify the notation, deﬁne Pj ≡ limn→∞ pnj0 as the probability of ruin given the initial
fortune of the gambler equals j. Then the above simpliﬁes to
Pj
P0

= qPj−1 + pPj+1 for j ∈ [1, b − 1] ,
= 1, and Pb = 0.

(11.3)

Now, knowing that Pj exists, it is not too hard to ﬁnd it from (11.3). This equation is
called a diﬀerence equation and there is a standard procedure for ﬁnding solutions of these.
You try a solution of the form Pj = xj and then try to ﬁnd x such that things work out.
Therefore, substitute this in to the ﬁrst equation of (11.3) and obtain
xj = qxj−1 + pxj+1 .
Therefore,
px2 − x + q = 0
and so in case p ̸= q, you can use the fact that p + q = 1 to obtain

Thus as the game becomes more fair in the sense the probabilities of winning become closer
to 1/2, the probability of ruin given an initial amount j is b−j
b .
Alternatively, you could consider the diﬀerence equation directly in the case where p =
q = 1/2. In this case, you can see that two solutions to the diﬀerence equation

This last case is pretty interesting because it shows, for example that if the gambler
starts with a fortune of 1 so that he starts at state j = 1, then his probability of losing all

b which might be quite large, especially if the other player has a lot of money to begin
with. As the gambler starts with more and more money, his probability of losing everything
does decrease.

Inner Product Spaces
12.1

General Theory

It is assumed here that the ﬁeld of scalars is either R or C. The usual example of an inner
product space is Cn or Rn as described earlier. However, there are many other inner product
spaces and the topic is of such importance that it seems appropriate to discuss the general
theory of these spaces.
Deﬁnition 12.1.1 A vector space X is said to be a normed linear space if there exists a
function, denoted by |·| : X → [0, ∞) which satisﬁes the following axioms.
1. |x| ≥ 0 for all x ∈ X, and |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0.
2. |ax| = |a| |x| for all a ∈ F.
3. |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| .
This function |·| is called a norm.
The notation ||x|| is also often used. Not all norms are created equal. There are many
geometric properties which they may or may not possess. There is also a concept called an
inner product which is discussed next. It turns out that the best norms come from an inner
product.
Deﬁnition 12.1.2 A mapping (·, ·) : V × V → F is called an inner product if it satisﬁes
the following axioms.
1. (x, y) = (y, x).
2. (x, x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ V and equals zero if and only if x = 0.
3. (ax + by, z) = a (x, z) + b (y, z) whenever a, b ∈ F.
Note that 2 and 3 imply (x, ay + bz) = a(x, y) + b(x, z).
Then a norm is given by
1/2
(x, x)
≡ |x| .
It remains to verify this really is a norm.
Deﬁnition 12.1.3 A normed linear space in which the norm comes from an inner product
as just described is called an inner product space.

INNER PRODUCT SPACES

Example 12.1.4 Let V = Cn with the inner product given by
(x, y) ≡

xk y k .

This is an example of a complex inner product space already discussed.
Example 12.1.5 Let V = Rn,
(x, y) = x · y ≡

n
∑

xj yj .

j=1

This is an example of a real inner product space.
Example 12.1.6 Let V be any ﬁnite dimensional vector space and let {v1 , · · · , vn } be a
basis. Decree that
{
1 if i = j
(vi , vj ) ≡ δ ij ≡
0 if i ̸= j
and deﬁne the inner product by
(x, y) ≡

n
∑

xi y i

i=1

where
x=

n
∑

x i vi , y =

i=1

n
∑

y i vi .

i=1

The above is well deﬁned because {v1 , · · · , vn } is a basis. Thus the components xi
associated with any given x ∈ V are uniquely determined.
This example shows there is no loss of generality when studying ﬁnite dimensional vector
spaces with ﬁeld of scalars R or C in assuming the vector space is actually an inner product
space. The following theorem was presented earlier with slightly diﬀerent notation.
Theorem 12.1.7 (Cauchy Schwarz) In any inner product space
|(x, y)| ≤ |x||y|.
1/2

where |x| ≡ (x, x)

.

Proof: Let ω ∈ C, |ω| = 1, and ω(x, y) = |(x, y)| = Re(x, yω). Let
F (t) = (x + tyω, x + tωy).
Then from the axioms of the inner product,
F (t) = |x|2 + 2t Re(x, ωy) + t2 |y|2 ≥ 0.
This yields
|x|2 + 2t|(x, y)| + t2 |y|2 ≥ 0.
If |y| = 0, then the inequality requires that |(x, y)| = 0 since otherwise, you could pick large
negative t and contradict the inequality. If |y| > 0, it follows from the quadratic formula
that
4|(x, y)|2 − 4|x|2 |y|2 ≤ 0. 
Earlier it was claimed that the inner product deﬁnes a norm. In this next proposition
this claim is proved.

Proposition 12.1.8 For an inner product space, |x| ≡ (x, x)

does specify a norm.

The best norms of all are those which come from an inner product because of the following
identity which is known as the parallelogram identity.

following identity holds.

2

, the

2

|x + y| + |x − y| = 2 |x| + 2 |y| .
It turns out that the validity of this identity is equivalent to the existence of an inner
product which determines the norm as described above. These sorts of considerations are
topics for more advanced courses on functional analysis.
Deﬁnition 12.1.10 A basis for an inner product space, {u1 , · · · , un } is an orthonormal
basis if

Lemma 12.2.1 Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional inner product space of dimension n whose

the property that for each k ≤ n, span(x1 , · · · , xk ) = span (u1 , · · · , uk ) .
Proof: Let {x1 , · · · , xn } be a basis for X. Let u1 ≡ x1 / |x1 | . Thus for k = 1, span (u1 ) =
span (x1 ) and {u1 } is an orthonormal set. Now suppose for some k < n, u1 , · · · , uk have
been chosen such that (uj , ul ) = δ jl and span (x1 , · · · , xk ) = span (u1 , · · · , uk ). Then deﬁne

INNER PRODUCT SPACES

Thus by induction,
uk+1 ∈ span (u1 , · · · , uk , xk+1 ) = span (x1 , · · · , xk , xk+1 ) .
Also, xk+1 ∈ span (u1 , · · · , uk , uk+1 ) which is seen easily by solving (12.1) for xk+1 and it
follows
span (x1 , · · · , xk , xk+1 ) = span (u1 , · · · , uk , uk+1 ) .

The vectors,
, generated in this way are therefore an orthonormal basis because
each vector has unit length. 
The process by which these vectors were generated is called the Gram Schmidt process.
The following corollary is obtained from the above process.
Corollary 12.2.2 Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional inner product space of dimension n whose
basis is {u1 , · · · , uk , xk+1 , · · · , xn } . Then if {u1 , · · · , uk } is orthonormal, then the Gram
Schmidt process applied to the given list of vectors in order leaves {u1 , · · · , uk } unchanged.

and so (x − y, z) = 0 for all z ∈ X. Thus this holds in particular for z = x − y. Therefore, x
= y. 
The following theorem is of fundamental importance. First note that a subspace of an
inner product space is also an inner product space because you can use the same inner
product.

12.2. THE GRAM SCHMIDT PROCESS

291

Theorem 12.2.4 Let M be a subspace of X, a ﬁnite dimensional inner product space and
m
let {xi }i=1 be an orthonormal basis for M . Then if y ∈ X and w ∈ M,
{
}
2

|y − w| = inf |y − z| : z ∈ M
(12.2)
if and only if
(y − w, z) = 0
for all z ∈ M. Furthermore,
w=

m
∑

(12.3)

(y, xi ) xi

(12.4)

i=1

is the unique element of M which has this property. It is called the orthogonal projection.
Proof: Let t ∈ R. Then from the properties of the inner product,
2

2

2

|y − (w + t (z − w))| = |y − w| + 2t Re (y − w, w − z) + t2 |z − w| .

(12.5)

If (y − w, z) = 0 for all z ∈ M, then letting t = 1, the middle term in the above expression
2
vanishes and so |y − z| is minimized when z = w.
Conversely, if (12.2) holds, then the middle term of (12.5) must also vanish since otherwise, you could choose small real t such that
2

2

|y − w| > |y − (w + t (z − w))| .
Here is why. If Re (y − w, w − z) < 0, then let t be very small and positive. The middle
term in (12.5) will then be more negative than the last term is positive and the right side
2
of this formula will then be less than |y − w| . If Re (y − w, w − z) > 0 then choose t small
and negative to achieve the same result.
It follows, letting z1 = w − z that
Re (y − w, z1 ) = 0
for all z1 ∈ M. Now letting ω ∈ C be such that ω (y − w, z1 ) = |(y − w, z1 )| ,
|(y − w, z1 )| = (y − w, ωz1 ) = Re (y − w, ωz1 ) = 0,
which proves the ﬁrst part of the theorem since z1 is arbitrary.
It only remains to verify that w given in (12.4) satisﬁes (12.3) and is the only point of
M which does so. To do this, note that if ci , di are scalars, then the properties of the inner
product and the fact the {xi } are orthonormal implies

This shows w given in (12.4) does minimize the function, z → |y − z| for z ∈ M. It only

Riesz Representation Theorem

The next theorem is one of the most important results in the theory of inner product spaces.
It is called the Riesz representation theorem.
Theorem 12.3.1 Let f ∈ L (X, F) where X is an inner product space of dimension n.
Then there exists a unique z ∈ X such that for all x ∈ X,
f (x) = (x, z) .
Proof: First I will verify uniqueness. Suppose zj works for j = 1, 2. Then for all x ∈ X,
0 = f (x) − f (x) = (x, z1 − z2 )
and so z1 = z2 .
It remains to verify existence. By Lemma 12.2.1, there exists an orthonormal basis,

for all x ∈ X and y ∈ Y. The following formula holds

12.3. RIESZ REPRESENTATION THEOREM

293

Proof: Let fy ∈ L (X, F) be deﬁned as
fy (x) ≡ (Ax, y)Y .
Then by the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique element of X, A∗ (y) such
that
(Ax, y)Y = (x, A∗ (y))X .
It only remains to verify that A∗ is linear. Let a and b be scalars. Then for all x ∈ X,
(x, A∗ (ay1 + by2 ))X ≡ (Ax, (ay1 + by2 ))Y
≡ a (Ax, y1 ) + b (Ax, y2 ) ≡
a (x, A (y1 )) + b (x, A∗ (y2 )) = (x, aA∗ (y1 ) + bA∗ (y2 )) .
∗

Since this holds for every x, it follows
A∗ (ay1 + by2 ) = aA∗ (y1 ) + bA∗ (y2 )
which shows A∗ is linear as claimed.
Consider the last assertion that ∗ is conjugate linear.
(
∗ )
x, (αA + βB) y ≡ ((αA + βB) x, y)
= α (Ax, y) + β (Bx, y) = α (x, A∗ y) + β (x, B ∗ y)
(

= (x, αA∗ y) + x, βA∗ y = x, αA∗ + βA∗ y .
Since x is arbitrary,

(
)
∗
(αA + βB) y = αA∗ + βA∗ y

and since this is true for all y,
∗

(αA + βB) = αA∗ + βA∗ . 
Deﬁnition 12.3.3 The linear map, A∗ is called the adjoint of A. In the case when A : X →
X and A = A∗ , A is called a self adjoint map. Such a map is also called Hermitian.
( )T
Theorem 12.3.4 Let M be an m × n matrix. Then M ∗ = M

The next theorem is interesting. You have a p dimensional subspace of Fn where F = R
or C. Of course this might be “slanted”. However, there is a linear transformation Q which
preserves distances which maps this subspace to Fp .

Re (Qx,Qy) = Re (x,Q∗ Qy) = Re (x, y) .
Thus

Re (x,Q∗ Qy − y) = 0

(12.7)

for all x, y. Let ω be a complex number such that |ω| = 1 and
ω (x,Q∗ Qy − y) = |(x,Q∗ Qy − y)| .
Then from (12.7),
0 = Re (ωx, Q∗ Qy − y) = Re ω (x,Q∗ Qy − y)
= |(x,Q∗ Qy − y)|
and since x is arbitrary, it follows that for all y,
Q∗ Qy − y = 0
Thus

I = Q∗ Q.

Similarly QQ∗ = I. 

12.4. THE TENSOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS

12.4

295

The Tensor Product Of Two Vectors

Deﬁnition 12.4.1 Let X and Y be inner product spaces and let x ∈ X and y ∈ Y. Deﬁne
the tensor product of these two vectors, y ⊗ x, an element of L (X, Y ) by
y ⊗ x (u) ≡ y (u, x)X .
This is also called a rank one transformation because the image of this transformation is
contained in the span of the vector, y.
The veriﬁcation that this is a linear map is left to you. Be sure to verify this! The
following lemma has some of the most important properties of this linear transformation.
Lemma 12.4.2 Let X, Y, Z be inner product spaces. Then for α a scalar,
∗

(α (y ⊗ x)) = αx ⊗ y

(12.8)

(z ⊗ y1 ) (y2 ⊗ x) = (y2 , y1 ) z ⊗ x

(12.9)

Proof: Let u ∈ X and v ∈ Y. Then
(α (y ⊗ x) u, v) = (α (u, x) y, v) = α (u, x) (y, v)
and
(u, αx ⊗ y (v)) = (u, α (v, y) x) = α (y, v) (u, x) .
Therefore, this veriﬁes (12.8).
To verify (12.9), let u ∈ X.
(z ⊗ y1 ) (y2 ⊗ x) (u) = (u, x) (z ⊗ y1 ) (y2 ) = (u, x) (y2 , y1 ) z
and
(y2 , y1 ) z ⊗ x (u) = (y2 , y1 ) (u, x) z.
Since the two linear transformations on both sides of (12.9) give the same answer for every
u ∈ X, it follows the two transformations are the same. 
Deﬁnition 12.4.3 Let X, Y be two vector spaces. Then deﬁne for A, B ∈ L (X, Y ) and
α ∈ F, new elements of L (X, Y ) denoted by A + B and αA as follows.
(A + B) (x) ≡ Ax + Bx, (αA) x ≡ α (Ax) .
Theorem 12.4.4 Let X and Y be ﬁnite dimensional inner product spaces. Then L (X, Y )
is a vector space with the above deﬁnition of what it means to multiply by a scalar and add.
Let {v1 , · · · , vn } be an orthonormal basis for X and {w1 , · · · , wm } be an orthonormal basis
for Y. Then a basis for L (X, Y ) is
{wj ⊗ vi : i = 1, · · · , n, j = 1, · · · , m} .
Proof: It is obvious that L (X, Y ) is a vector space. It remains to verify the given set
is a basis. Consider the following:



∑
A −
(Avk , wl ) wl ⊗ vk  vp , wr  = (Avp , wr ) −

(Avk , wl ) δ pk δ rl

k,l

= (Avp , wr ) − (Avp , wr ) = 0.

∑

Letting A − k,l (Avk , wl ) wl ⊗ vk = B, this shows that Bvp = 0 since wr is an arbitrary
element of the basis for Y. Since vp is an arbitrary element of the basis for X, it follows
B = 0 as hoped. This has shown {wj ⊗ vi : i = 1, · · · , n, j = 1, · · · , m} spans L (X, Y ) .
It only remains to verify the wj ⊗ vi are linearly independent. Suppose then that
∑
cij wj ⊗ vi = 0
i,j

Then do both sides to vs . By deﬁnition this gives
∑
∑
∑
0=
cij wj (vs , vi ) =
cij wj δ si =
csj wj
i,j

i,j

j

Now the vectors {w1 , · · · , wm } are independent because it is an orthonormal set and so the
above requires csj = 0 for each j. Since s was arbitrary, this shows the linear transformations,
{wj ⊗ vi } form a linearly independent set. 
Note this shows the dimension of L (X, Y ) = nm. The theorem is also of enormous
importance because it shows you can always consider an arbitrary linear transformation as
a sum of rank one transformations whose properties are easily understood. The following
theorem is also of great interest.
∑
Theorem 12.4.5 Let A = i,j cij wi ⊗ vj ∈ L (X, Y ) where as before, the vectors, {wi } are
an orthonormal basis for Y and the vectors, {vj } are an orthonormal basis for X. Then if
the matrix of A has entries Mij , it follows that Mij = cij .
Proof: Recall
Avi ≡

∑

Mki wk

Also
Avi

Least Squares

A common problem in experimental work is to ﬁnd a straight line which approximates as
p
well as possible a collection of points in the plane {(xi , yi )}i=1 . The usual way of dealing
with these problems is by the method of least squares and it turns out that all these sorts
of approximation problems can be reduced to Ax = b where the problem is to ﬁnd the best
x for solving this equation even when there is no solution.

12.5. LEAST SQUARES

297

Lemma 12.5.1 Let V and W be ﬁnite dimensional inner product spaces and let A : V → W
be linear. For each y ∈ W there exists x ∈ V such that
|Ax − y| ≤ |Ax1 − y|
for all x1 ∈ V. Also, x ∈ V is a solution to this minimization problem if and only if x is a
solution to the equation, A∗ Ax = A∗ y.
Proof: By Theorem 12.2.4 on Page 291 there exists a point, Ax0 , in the ﬁnite dimen2
2
sional subspace, A (V ) , of W such that for all x ∈ V, |Ax − y| ≥ |Ax0 − y| . Also, from
this theorem, this happens if and only if Ax0 − y is perpendicular to every Ax ∈ A (V ) .
Therefore, the solution is characterized by (Ax0 − y, Ax) = 0 for all x ∈ V which is the
same as saying (A∗ Ax0 − A∗ y, x) = 0 for all x ∈ V. In other words the solution is obtained
by solving A∗ Ax0 = A∗ y for x0 . 
Consider the problem of ﬁnding the least squares regression line in statistics. Suppose
n
you have given points in the plane, {(xi , yi )}i=1 and you would like to ﬁnd constants m
and b such that the line y = mx + b goes through all these points. Of course this will be
impossible in general. Therefore, try to ﬁnd m, b such that you do the best you can to solve

Fredholm Alternative Again

The best context in which to study the Fredholm alternative is in inner product spaces.
This is done here.
Deﬁnition 12.6.1 Let S be a subset of an inner product space, X. Deﬁne
S ⊥ ≡ {x ∈ X : (x, s) = 0 for all s ∈ S} .
The following theorem also follows from the above lemma. It is sometimes called the
Fredholm alternative.
Theorem 12.6.2 Let A : V → W where A is linear and V and W are inner product spaces.
⊥
Then A (V ) = ker (A∗ ) .
Proof: Let y = Ax so y ∈ A (V ) . Then if A∗ z = 0,
(y, z) = (Ax, z) = (x, A∗ z) = 0
⊥

⊥

showing that y ∈ ker (A∗ ) . Thus A (V ) ⊆ ker (A∗ ) .
⊥
Now suppose y ∈ ker (A∗ ) . Does there exists x such that Ax = y? Since this might
not be immediately clear, take the least squares solution to the problem. Thus let x be a
solution to A∗ Ax = A∗ y. It follows A∗ (y − Ax) = 0 and so y − Ax ∈ ker (A∗ ) which implies
from the assumption about y that (y − Ax, y) = 0. Also, since Ax is the closest point to
y in A (V ) , Theorem 12.2.4 on Page 291 implies that (y − Ax, Ax1 ) = 0 for all x1 ∈ V.

z

{

In particular this is true for x1 = x and so 0 = (y − Ax, y) − (y − Ax, Ax) = |y − Ax| ,
⊥
showing that y = Ax. Thus A (V ) ⊇ ker (A∗ ) . 
Corollary 12.6.3 Let A, V, and W be as described above. If the only solution to A∗ y = 0
is y = 0, then A is onto W.
Proof: If the only solution to A∗ y = 0 is y = 0, then ker (A∗ ) = {0} and so every vector
⊥
from W is contained in ker (A∗ ) and by the above theorem, this shows A (V ) = W . 

This is called a minimizing sequence. Show there exists a unique k ∈ K such that
limn→∞ |kn − k| and that k = P x. That is, there exists a well deﬁned projection map

manner to show {kn } is a Cauchy sequence which must therefore converge. Since K

to vary and the inequality continues to hold for all k ∈ K.

The Determinant And Volume

The determinant is the essential algebraic tool which provides a way to give a uniﬁed treatment of the concept of p dimensional volume of a parallelepiped in RM . Here is the deﬁnition
of what is meant by such a thing.
Deﬁnition 12.8.1 Let u1 , · · · , up be vectors in RM , M ≥ p. The parallelepiped determined
by these vectors will be denoted by P (u1 , · · · , up ) and it is deﬁned as


p
∑

P (u1 , · · · , up ) ≡
sj uj : sj ∈ [0, 1] .


j=1

The volume of this parallelepiped is deﬁned as
volume of P (u1 , · · · , up ) ≡ v (P (u1 , · · · , up )) ≡ (det (ui · uj ))

1/2

.

If the vectors are dependent, this deﬁnition will give the volume to be 0.
∑
First lets observe the last assertion is true. Say ui = j̸=i αj uj . Then the ith row is
a linear combination of the other rows and so from the properties of the determinant, the
determinant of this matrix is indeed zero as it should be.
A parallelepiped is a sort of a squashed box. Here is a picture which shows the relationship between P (u1 , · · · , up−1 ) and P (u1 , · · · , up ).

P (u1 , · · · , up−1 )
-

In a sense, we can deﬁne the volume any way we want but if it is to be reasonable, the
following relationship must hold. The appropriate deﬁnition of the volume of P (u1 , · · · , up )
in terms of P (u1 , · · · , up−1 ) is
v (P (u1 , · · · , up )) = |up | |cos (θ)| v (P (u1 , · · · , up−1 ))

(12.11)

In the case where p = 1, the parallelepiped P (v) consists of the single vector and the one
(
)1/2
. Now having made this deﬁnition, I will show
dimensional volume should be |v| = vT v
that this is the appropriate deﬁnition of p dimensional volume for every p.

As just pointed out, this is the only reasonable deﬁnition of volume in the case of one
vector. The next theorem shows that it is the only reasonable deﬁnition of volume of a
parallelepiped in the case of p vectors because (12.11) holds.
Theorem 12.8.3 With the above deﬁnition of volume, (12.11) holds.
Proof: To check whether this is so, it is necessary to ﬁnd |cos (θ)| . This involves ﬁnding
the vector perpendicular to P (u1 , · · · , up−1 ) . Let {w1 , · · · , wp } be an orthonormal basis
for span (u1 , · · · , up ) such that span (w1 , · · · , wk ) = span (u1 , · · · , uk ) for each k ≤ p. Such
an orthonormal basis exists because of the Gram Schmidt procedure. First note that since
{wk } is an orthonormal basis for span (u1 , · · · , up ) ,
uj =

(uj · wk ) wk

and if i, j ≤ k

which results from formally expanding along the top row. Note that from what was just

because the matrix has two equal rows while if j = p, the above discussion shows N · up
equals ±v (P (u1 , · · · , up )). Therefore, N points in the direction of the normal vector in the
above picture or else it points in the opposite direction to this vector. From the geometric
description of the dot product,
|N · up |
|cos (θ)| =
|up | |N|
and it follows
|up | |cos (θ)| v (P (u1 , · · · , up−1 )) = |up |
=

|N · up |
v (P (u1 , · · · , up−1 ))
|up | |N|

v (P (u1 , · · · , up ))
v (P (u1 , · · · , up−1 ))
|N|

Now at this point, note that from the construction, wp · uk = 0 whenever k ≤ p − 1 because
uk ∈ span (w1 , · · · , wp−1 ). Therefore, |N| = |A1p | = v (P (u1 , · · · , up−1 )) and so the above
reduces to
|up | |cos (θ)| v (P (u1 , · · · , up−1 )) = v (P (u1 , · · · , up )) . 
The theorem shows that the only reasonable deﬁnition of p dimensional volume of a
parallelepiped is the one given in the above deﬁnition.

Simultaneous Diagonalization

Recall the following deﬁnition of what it means for a matrix to be diagonalizable.
Deﬁnition 13.1.1 Let A be an n × n matrix. It is said to be diagonalizable if there exists
an invertible matrix S such that
S −1 AS = D
where D is a diagonal matrix.
Also, here is a useful observation.
Observation 13.1.2 If A is an n × n matrix and AS = SD for D a diagonal matrix, then
each column of S is an eigenvector or else it is the zero vector. This follows from observing
that for sk the k th column of S and from the way we multiply matrices,
Ask = λk sk
It is sometimes interesting to consider the problem of ﬁnding a single similarity transformation which will diagonalize all the matrices in some set.
Lemma 13.1.3 Let A be an n × n matrix and let B be an m × m matrix. Denote by C the
matrix
(
)
A 0
C≡
.
0 B
Then C is diagonalizable if and only if both A and B are diagonalizable.

Proof: Suppose SA
ASA = DA and SB
BSB = DB where (
DA and DB)are diagonal
SA 0
matrices. You should use block multiplication to verify that S ≡
is such that
0 SB
S −1 CS = DC , a diagonal matrix.
Conversely, suppose C is diagonalized by S = (s1 , · · · , sn+m ) . Thus S has columns si .
For each of these columns, write in the form
(
)
xi
si =
yi

where xi ∈ Fn and where yi ∈ Fm . The result is

where S11 is an n × n matrix and S22 is an m × m matrix. Then there is a diagonal matrix
(

D1 0
0 D2

Hence by block multiplication
AS11 = S11 D1 , BS22 = S22 D2
BS21 = S21 D1 , AS12 = S12 D2
It follows each of the xi is an eigenvector of A or else is the zero vector and that each of the
yi is an eigenvector of B or is the zero vector. If there are n linearly independent xi , then
A is diagonalizable by Theorem 9.3.12 on Page 9.3.12.
The row rank of the matrix (x1 , · · · , xn+m ) must be n because if this is not so, the rank
of S would be less than n + m which would mean S −1 does not exist. Therefore, since the
column rank equals the row rank, this matrix has column rank equal to n and this means
there are n linearly independent eigenvectors of A implying that A is diagonalizable. Similar
reasoning applies to B. 
The following corollary follows from the same type of argument as the above.
Corollary 13.1.4 Let Ak be an nk × nk matrix and let C denote the block diagonal

Then C is diagonalizable if and only if each Ak is diagonalizable.
Deﬁnition 13.1.5 A set, F of n × n matrices is said to be simultaneously diagonalizable if
and only if there exists a single invertible matrix S such that for every A ∈ F , S −1 AS = DA
where DA is a diagonal matrix.
Lemma 13.1.6 If F is a set of n × n matrices which is simultaneously diagonalizable, then
F is a commuting family of matrices.
Proof: Let A, B ∈ F and let S be a matrix which has the property that S −1 AS is a
diagonal matrix for all A ∈ F. Then S −1 AS = DA and S −1 BS = DB where DA and DB
are diagonal matrices. Since diagonal matrices commute,
AB

= SDB DA S −1 = SDB S −1 SDA S −1 = BA.

Lemma 13.1.8 Let F denote a commuting family of n × n matrices such that each A ∈ F
is diagonalizable. Then F is simultaneously diagonalizable.
Proof: First note that if every matrix in F has only one eigenvalue, there is nothing to
prove. This is because for A such a matrix,
S −1 AS = λI
and so
A = λI
Thus all the matrices in F are diagonal matrices and you could pick any S to diagonalize
them all. Therefore, without loss of generality, assume some matrix in F has more than one
eigenvalue.
The signiﬁcant part of the lemma is proved by induction on n. If n = 1, there is nothing
to prove because all the 1 × 1 matrices are already diagonal matrices. Suppose then that
the theorem is true for all k ≤ n − 1 where n ≥ 2 and let F be a commuting family of
diagonalizable n × n matrices. Pick A ∈ F which has more than one eigenvalue and let
S be an invertible matrix such that S −1 AS = D where D is of the form given in (13.1).
By permuting the columns of S there is no loss
{ of generality in
} assuming D has this form.
Now denote by Fe the collection of matrices, S −1 CS : C ∈ F . Note Fe features the single
matrix S.

It follows easily that Fe is also a commuting family of diagonalizable matrices. By
Lemma 13.1.7 every B ∈ Fe is of the form given in (13.2) because each of these commutes
with D described above as S −1 AS and so by block multiplication, the diagonal blocks Bi
corresponding to diﬀerent B ∈ Fe commute.
By Corollary 13.1.4 each of these blocks is diagonalizable. This is because B is known to
be so. Therefore, by induction, since all the blocks are no larger than n − 1 × n − 1 thanks to
the assumption that A has more than one eigenvalue, there exist invertible ni × ni matrices,
Ti such that Ti−1 Bi Ti is a diagonal matrix whenever Bi is one of the matrices making up
the block diagonal of any B ∈ F . It follows that for T deﬁned by

diagonalizable. If it is simultaneously diagonalizable, then it follows from Lemma 13.1.6 that
it is a commuting family. 

space, it could be represented in the form
∑
lij vi ⊗ vj
L=

where {v1 , · · · , vn } is an orthonormal basis. Of course diﬀerent bases will yield diﬀerent
matrices, (lij ) . Schur’s theorem gives the existence of a basis in an inner product space such
that (lij ) is particularly simple.
Deﬁnition 13.2.1 Let L ∈ L (V, V ) where V is vector space. Then a subspace U of V is L
invariant if L (U ) ⊆ U.
In what follows, F will be the ﬁeld of scalars, usually C but maybe something else.
Theorem 13.2.2 Let L ∈ L (H, H) for H a ﬁnite dimensional inner product space such
that the restriction of L∗ to every L invariant subspace has its eigenvalues in F. Then there

13.2. SCHUR’S THEOREM

311

Proof: If dim (H) = 1, let H = span (w) where |w| = 1. Then Lw = kw for some k.
Then
L = kw ⊗ w
because by deﬁnition, w ⊗ w (w) = w. Therefore, the theorem holds if H is 1 dimensional.
Now suppose the theorem holds for n − 1 = dim (H) . Let wn be an eigenvector for L∗ .
Dividing by its length, it can be assumed |wn | = 1. Say L∗ wn = µwn . Using the Gram
Schmidt process, there exists an orthonormal basis for H of the form {v1 , · · · , vn−1 , wn } .
Then
(Lvk , wn ) = (vk , L∗ wn ) = (vk , µwn ) = 0,
which shows
L : H1 ≡ span (v1 , · · · , vn−1 ) → span (v1 , · · · , vn−1 ) .
Denote by L1 the restriction of L to H1 . Since H1 has dimension n − 1, the induction
hypothesis yields an orthonormal basis, {w1 , · · · , wn−1 } for H1 such that
j
n−1
∑∑

L1 =

(13.3)

j=1 i=1

Then {w1 , · · · , wn } is an orthonormal basis for H because every vector in
span (v1 , · · · , vn−1 )
has the property that its inner product with wn is 0 so in particular, this is true for the
vectors {w1 , · · · , wn−1 }. Now deﬁne cin to be the scalars satisfying

Since L = B on the basis {w1 , · · · , wn } , it follows L = B.
It remains to verify the constants, ckk are the eigenvalues of L, solutions of the equation,
det (λI − L) = 0. However, the deﬁnition of det (λI − L) is the same as
det (λI − C)
where C is the upper triangular matrix which has cij for i ≤ j and zeros elsewhere. This
equals 0 if and only if λ is one of the diagonal entries, one of the ckk . 
Now with the above Schur’s theorem, the following diagonalization theorem comes very
easily. Recall the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 13.2.3 Let L ∈ L (H, H) where H is a ﬁnite dimensional inner product space.

L is Hermitian, then all of its eigenvalues λk are real and there exists an orthonormal basis

By independence, if i = j,
lii = lii
and so these are all real. If i < j, it follows from independence again that
lij = 0
because the coeﬃcients corresponding to i < j are all 0 on the right side. Similarly if i > j,
it follows lij = 0. Letting λk = lkk , this shows
∑
L=

That each of these wk is an eigenvector corresponding to λk is obvious from the deﬁnition
of the tensor product. 

Spectral Theory Of Self Adjoint Operators

The following theorem is about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a self adjoint operator.
Such operators are also called Hermitian as in the case of matrices. The proof given generalizes to the situation of a compact self adjoint operator on a Hilbert space and leads to
many very useful results. It is also a very elementary proof because it does not use the
fundamental theorem of algebra and it contains a way, very important in applications, of
ﬁnding the eigenvalues. This proof depends more directly on the methods of analysis than
the preceding material. The ﬁeld of scalars will be R or C. The following is useful notation.
Deﬁnition 13.3.1 Let X be an inner product space and let S ⊆ X. Then
S ⊥ ≡ {x ∈ X : (x, s) = 0 for all s ∈ S} .
Note that even if S is not a subspace, S ⊥ is.

Deﬁnition 13.3.2 A Hilbert space is a complete inner product space. Recall this means
that every Cauchy sequence,{xn } , one which satisﬁes
lim |xn − xm | = 0,

n,m→∞

converges. It can be shown, although I will not do so here, that for the ﬁeld of scalars either
R or C, any ﬁnite dimensional inner product space is automatically complete.
Theorem 13.3.3 Let A ∈ L (X, X) be self adjoint (Hermitian) where X is a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. Thus A = A∗ . Then there exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors,
n
{uj }j=1 .
Proof: Consider (Ax, x) . This quantity is always a real number because
(Ax, x) = (x, Ax) = (x, A∗ x) = (Ax, x)
thanks to the assumption that A is self adjoint. Now deﬁne
λ1 ≡ inf {(Ax, x) : |x| = 1, x ∈ X1 ≡ X} .
Claim: λ1 is ﬁnite and there exists v1 ∈ X with |v1 | = 1 such that (Av1 , v1 ) = λ1 .

Proof of claim: Let {uj }j=1 be an orthonormal basis for X and for x ∈ X, let (x1 , · · · ,
xn ) be deﬁned as the components of the vector x. Thus,
x=

where (x1 , · · · , xn ) is the point of K at which the above function achieves its minimum.
This proves the claim.

As before, there exists v2 ∈ X2 such that (Av2 , v2 ) = λ2 , λ1 ≤ λ2 . Now let X3 ≡ {v1 , v2 }
n
and continue in this way. This leads to an increasing sequence of real numbers, {λk }k=1 and
an orthonormal set of vectors, {v1 , · · · , vn }. It only remains to show these are eigenvectors
and that the λj are eigenvalues.
Consider the ﬁrst of these vectors. Letting w ∈ X1 ≡ X, the function of the real variable,
t, given by
(A (v1 + tw) , v1 + tw)
f (t) ≡
2
|v1 + tw|
=

(Av1 , v1 ) + 2t Re (Av1 , w) + t2 (Aw, w)
2

2

|v1 | + 2t Re (v1 , w) + t2 |w|
achieves its minimum when t = 0. Therefore, the derivative of this function evaluated at
t = 0 must equal zero. Using the quotient rule, this implies, since |v1 | = 1 that
2

2 Re (Av1 , w) |v1 | − 2 Re (v1 , w) (Av1 , v1 )
= 2 (Re (Av1 , w) − Re (v1 , w) λ1 ) = 0.
Thus Re (Av1 − λ1 v1 , w) = 0 for all w ∈ X. This implies Av1 = λ1 v1 . To see this, let w ∈ X
be arbitrary and let θ be a complex number with |θ| = 1 and
|(Av1 − λ1 v1 , w)| = θ (Av1 − λ1 v1 , w) .
Then

(
)
|(Av1 − λ1 v1 , w)| = Re Av1 − λ1 v1 , θw = 0.

Since this holds for all w, Av1 = λ1 v1 .
Now suppose Avk = λk vk for all k < m. Observe that A : Xm → Xm because if y ∈ Xm
and k < m,
(Ay, vk ) = (y, Avk ) = (y, λk vk ) = 0,
⊥

showing that Ay ∈ {v1 , · · · , vm−1 } ≡ Xm . Thus the same argument just given shows that
for all w ∈ Xm ,
(Avm − λm vm , w) = 0.
(13.5)
Since Avm ∈ Xm , I can let w = Avm − λm vm in the above and thereby conclude Avm =
λm vm . 
Contained in the proof of this theorem is the following important corollary.
Corollary 13.3.4 Let A ∈ L (X, X) be self adjoint where X is a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert
space. Then all the eigenvalues are real and for λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn the eigenvalues of A,
there exists an orthonormal set of vectors {u1 , · · · , un } for which
Auk = λk uk .
Furthermore,
λk ≡ inf {(Ax, x) : |x| = 1, x ∈ Xk }
where

Xk ≡ {u1 , · · · , uk−1 } , X1 ≡ X.
Corollary 13.3.5 Let A ∈ L (X, X) be self adjoint (Hermitian) where X is a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. Then the largest eigenvalue of A is given by
max {(Ax, x) : |x| = 1}

(13.6)

and the minimum eigenvalue of A is given by
min {(Ax, x) : |x| = 1} .

The result of Courant and Fischer which follows resembles Corollary 13.3.4 but is more
useful because it does not depend on a knowledge of the eigenvectors.

13.4. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS

13.4

Positive And Negative Linear Transformations

The notion of a positive deﬁnite or negative deﬁnite linear transformation is very important
in many applications. In particular it is used in versions of the second derivative test for
functions of many variables. Here the main interest is the case of a linear transformation
which is an n×n matrix but the theorem is stated and proved using a more general notation
because all these issues discussed here have interesting generalizations to functional analysis.
Lemma 13.4.1 Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space and let A ∈ L (X, X) . Then
if {v1 , · · · , vn } is an orthonormal basis for X and M (A) denotes the matrix of the linear
∗
transformation A then M (A∗ ) = (M (A)) . In particular, A is self adjoint, if and only if
M (A) is.
Proof: Consider the following picture
A
→
X
◦
↑q
→
Fn
M (A)
∑
where q is the coordinate map which satisﬁes q (x) ≡ i xi vi . Therefore, since {v1 , · · · , vn }
is orthonormal, it is clear that |x| = |q (x)| . Therefore,

|x + y| = |q (x + y)|

= |q (x)| + |q (y)| + 2 Re (q (x) , q (y))

(13.13)

Now in any inner product space,
(x, iy) = Re (x, iy) + i Im (x, iy) .
Also
(x, iy) = (−i) (x, y) = (−i) Re (x, y) + Im (x, y) .
Therefore, equating the real parts, Im (x, y) = Re (x, iy) and so
(x, y) = Re (x, y) + i Re (x, iy)

(13.14)

Now from (13.13), since q preserves distances, . Re (q (x) , q (y)) = Re (x, y) which implies
from (13.14) that
(x, y) = (q (x) , q (y)) .
(13.15)
Now consulting the diagram which gives the meaning for the matrix of a linear transformation, observe that q ◦ M (A) = A ◦ q and q ◦ M (A∗ ) = A∗ ◦ q. Therefore, from (13.15)
(A (q (x)) , q (y)) = (q (x) , A∗ q (y)) = (q (x) , q (M (A∗ ) (y))) = (x, M (A∗ ) (y))
but also
(
)
∗
(A (q (x)) , q (y)) = (q (M (A) (x)) , q (y)) = (M (A) (x) , y) = x, M (A) (y) .
∗

Since x, y are arbitrary, this shows that M (A∗ ) = M (A) as claimed. Therefore, if A is self
∗
∗
adjoint, M (A) = M (A∗ ) = M (A) and so M (A) is also self adjoint. If M (A) = M (A)
∗
∗
then M (A) = M (A ) and so A = A . 
The following corollary is one of the items in the above proof.

SELF ADJOINT OPERATORS

Corollary 13.4.2 Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space and let {v1 , · · · , vn } be an
orthonormal basis
∑ for X. Also, let q be the coordinate map associated with this basis satisfying q (x) ≡ i xi vi . Then (x, y)Fn = (q (x) , q (y))X . Also, if A ∈ L (X, X) , and M (A)
is the matrix of A with respect to this basis,
(Aq (x) , q (y))X = (M (A) x, y)Fn .
Deﬁnition 13.4.3 A self adjoint A ∈ L (X, X) , is positive deﬁnite if whenever x ̸= 0,
(Ax, x) > 0 and A is negative deﬁnite if for all x ̸= 0, (Ax, x) < 0. A is positive semidefinite or just nonnegative for short if for all x, (Ax, x) ≥ 0. A is negative semideﬁnite or
nonpositive for short if for all x, (Ax, x) ≤ 0.
The following lemma is of fundamental importance in determining which linear transformations are positive or negative deﬁnite.
Lemma 13.4.4 Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. A self adjoint A ∈ L (X, X)
is positive deﬁnite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive and negative deﬁnite if and
only if all its eigenvalues are negative. It is positive semideﬁnite if all the eigenvalues are
nonnegative and it is negative semideﬁnite if all the eigenvalues are nonpositive.
Proof: Suppose ﬁrst that A is positive deﬁnite and let λ be an eigenvalue. Then for x
an eigenvector corresponding to λ, λ (x, x) = (λx, x) = (Ax, x) > 0. Therefore, λ > 0 as
claimed.
Now suppose
∑n all the eigenvalues of A are positive. From Theorem 13.3.3 and Corollary
13.3.6, A =
i=1 λi ui ⊗ ui where the λi are the positive eigenvalues and {ui } are an
orthonormal set of eigenvectors. Therefore, letting x ̸= 0,

because, since {ui } is an orthonormal basis, |x| = i=1 |(ui , x)| .
To establish the claim about negative deﬁnite, it suﬃces to note that A is negative
deﬁnite if and only if −A is positive deﬁnite and the eigenvalues of A are (−1) times the
eigenvalues of −A. The claims about positive semideﬁnite and negative semideﬁnite are
obtained similarly. 
The next theorem is about a way to recognize whether a self adjoint A ∈ L (X, X) is
positive or negative deﬁnite without having to ﬁnd the eigenvalues. In order to state this
theorem, here is some notation.
Deﬁnition 13.4.5 Let A be an n × n matrix. Denote by Ak the k × k matrix obtained by
deleting the k + 1, · · · , n columns and the k + 1, · · · , n rows from A. Thus An = A and Ak
is the k × k submatrix of A which occupies the upper left corner of A. The determinants of
these submatrices are called the principle minors.
The following theorem is proved in [8]
Theorem 13.4.6 Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space and let A ∈ L (X, X) be self
adjoint. Then A is positive deﬁnite if and only if det (M (A)k ) > 0 for every k = 1, · · · , n.
Here M (A) denotes the matrix of A with respect to some ﬁxed orthonormal basis of X.

Proof: This theorem is proved by induction on n. It is clearly true if n = 1. Suppose then
that it is true for n−1 where n ≥ 2. Since det (M (A)) > 0, it follows that all the eigenvalues
are nonzero. Are they all positive? Suppose not. Then there is some even number of them
which are negative, even because the product of all the eigenvalues is known to be positive,
equaling det (M (A)). Pick two, λ1 and λ2 and let M (A) ui = λi ui where ui ̸= 0 for i = 1, 2
and (u1 , u2 ) = 0. Now if y ≡ α1 u1 + α2 u2 is an element of span (u1 , u2 ) , then since these
are eigenvalues and (u1 , u2 ) = 0, a short computation shows
(M (A) (α1 u1 + α2 u2 ) , α1 u1 + α2 u2 )

Now the dimension of {z ∈ Cn : zn = 0} is n − 1 and the dimension of span (u1 , u2 ) = 2 and
so there must be some nonzero x ∈ Cn which is in both of these subspaces of Cn . However,
the ﬁrst computation would require that (M (A) x, x) < 0 while the second would require
that (M (A) x, x) > 0. This contradiction shows that all the eigenvalues must be positive.
This proves the if part of the theorem. The only if part is left to the reader.
Corollary 13.4.7 Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space and let A ∈ L (X, X) be
k
self adjoint. Then A is negative deﬁnite if and only if det (M (A)k ) (−1) > 0 for every
k = 1, · · · , n. Here M (A) denotes the matrix of A with respect to some ﬁxed orthonormal
basis of X.
Proof: This is immediate from the above theorem by noting that, as in the proof of
Lemma 13.4.4, A is negative deﬁnite if and only if −A is positive deﬁnite. Therefore, if
det (−M (A)k ) > 0 for all k = 1, · · · , n, it follows that A is negative deﬁnite. However,
k
det (−M (A)k ) = (−1) det (M (A)k ) . 

Fractional Powers

With the above theory, it is possible to take fractional powers of certain elements of L (X, X)
where X is a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. To begin with, consider the square root of a
nonnegative self adjoint operator. This is easier than the general theory and it is the square
root which is of most importance.
Theorem 13.5.1 Let A ∈ L (X, X) be self adjoint and nonnegative. Then there exists a
unique self adjoint nonnegative B ∈ L (X, X) such that B 2 = A and B commutes with every
element of L (X, X) which commutes with A.
Proof: By Theorem 13.3.3, there exists an orthonormal basis of
∑eigenvectors of A, say
n
{vi }i=1 such that Avi = λi vi . Therefore, by Theorem 13.2.4, A = i λi vi ⊗ vi where each
λi ≥ 0.
Now by Lemma 13.4.4, each λi ≥ 0. Therefore, it makes sense to deﬁne

Therefore,

which amounts to saying that B also commutes with C. It is
clear that this operator is self adjoint. This proves existence.
Suppose B1 is another square root which is self adjoint, nonnegative and commutes with
every matrix which commutes with A. Since both B, B1 are nonnegative,
(B (B − B1 ) x, (B − B1 ) x) ≥ 0,
(B1 (B − B1 ) x, (B − B1 ) x) ≥ 0

(13.16)

Now, adding these together, and using the fact that the two commute,
(( 2

B − B12 x, (B − B1 ) x = ((A − A) x, (B − B1 ) x) = 0.
It follows that both inner products in (13.16) equal 0. Next

B (B − B1 ) x = B1 (B − B1 ) x = 0. Thus also,
B (B − B1 ) x = B1 (B − B1 ) x = 0

Hence
0 = (B (B − B1 ) x − B1 (B − B1 ) x, x) = ((B − B1 ) x, (B − B1 ) x)
and so, since x is arbitrary, B1 = B. 
The main result is the following theorem.
Theorem 13.5.2 Let A ∈ L (X, X) be self adjoint and nonnegative and let k be a positive
integer. Then there exists a unique self adjoint nonnegative B ∈ L (X, X) such that B k = A.

Therefore, {B, C} is a commuting family of linear transformations which are both self

Polar Decompositions

An application of Theorem 13.3.3, is the following fundamental result, important in geometric measure theory and continuum mechanics. It is sometimes called the right polar
decomposition. The notation used is that which is seen in continuum mechanics, see for
example Gurtin [11]. Don’t confuse the U in this theorem with a unitary transformation.
It is not so. When the following theorem is applied in continuum mechanics, F is normally
the deformation gradient, the derivative of a nonlinear map from some subset of three dimensional space to three dimensional space. In this context, U is called the right Cauchy
Green strain tensor. It is a measure of how a body is stretched independent of rigid motions.
First, here is a simple lemma.
Lemma 13.6.1 Suppose R ∈ L (X, Y ) where X, Y are Hilbert spaces and R preserves distances. Then R∗ R = I.
Proof: Since R preserves distances, |Rx| = |x| for every x. Therefore from the axioms
of the inner product,
2

|x| + |y| + (x, y) + (y, x) = |x + y| = (R (x + y) , R (x + y))
= (Rx,Rx) + (Ry,Ry) + (Rx, Ry) + (Ry, Rx)
= |x| + |y| + (R∗ Rx, y) + (y, R∗ Rx)
2

and so for all x, y,

2

(R∗ Rx − x, y) + (y,R∗ Rx − x) = 0

Hence for all x, y,

Re (R∗ Rx − x, y) = 0

Now for x, y given, choose α ∈ C such that
α (R∗ Rx − x, y) = |(R∗ Rx − x, y)|
Then

all eigenvalues of U are non negative,

Proof: (F ∗ F ) = F ∗ F and so by Theorem 13.3.3, there is an orthonormal basis of

It is also clear that λi ≥ 0 because

Let {U x1 , · · · , U xr } be an orthonormal basis for U (X) . By the Gram Schmidt procedure
there exists an extension to an orthonormal basis for X,
{U x1 , · · · , U xr , yr+1 , · · · , yn } .
Next note that {F x1 , · · · , F xr } is also an orthonormal set of vectors in Y because
(

(F xk , F xj ) = (F ∗ F xk , xj ) = U 2 xk , xj = (U xk , U xj ) = δ jk .
By the Gram Schmidt procedure, there exists an extension of {F x1 , · · · , F xr } to an orthonormal basis for Y,
{F x1 , · · · , F xr , zr+1 , · · · , zm } .
Since m ≥ n, there are at least as many zk as there are yk . Now for x ∈ X, since
{U x1 , · · · , U xr , yr+1 , · · · , yn }
is an orthonormal basis for X, there exist unique scalars

The following corollary follows as a simple consequence of this theorem. It is called the
left polar decomposition.
Corollary 13.6.3 Let F ∈ L (X, Y ) and suppose n ≥ m where X is a Hilbert space of
dimension n and Y is a Hilbert space of dimension m. Then there exists a Hermitian U ∈
L (X, X) , and an element of L (X, Y ) , R, such that
F = U R, RR∗ = I.
∗

Proof: Recall that L∗∗ = L and (M L) = L∗ M ∗ . Now apply Theorem 13.6.2 to
∗
F ∈ L (Y, X). Thus,
F ∗ = R∗ U
where R∗ and U satisfy the conditions of that theorem. Then
F = UR
and RR∗ = R∗∗ R∗ = I. 
The following existence theorem for the polar decomposition of an element of L (X, X)
is a corollary.
Corollary 13.6.4 Let F ∈ L (X, X). Then there exists a Hermitian W ∈ L (X, X) , and
a unitary matrix Q such that F = W Q, and there exists a Hermitian U ∈ L (X, X) and a
unitary R, such that F = RU.
This corollary has a fascinating relation to the question whether a given linear transformation is normal. Recall that an n × n matrix A, is normal if AA∗ = A∗ A. Retain the same
deﬁnition for an element of L (X, X) .
Theorem 13.6.5 Let F ∈ L (X, X) . Then F is normal if and only if in Corollary 13.6.4
RU = U R and QW = W Q.

13.7. AN APPLICATION TO STATISTICS

Proof: I will prove the statement about RU = U R and leave the other part as an
exercise. First suppose that RU = U R and show F is normal. To begin with,
∗

∗

U R∗ = (RU ) = (U R) = R∗ U.
Therefore,
F ∗F

=

U R∗ RU = U 2

FF∗

=

RU U R∗ = U RR∗ U = U 2

which shows F is normal.
Now suppose F is normal. Is RU = U R? Since F is normal,
F F ∗ = RU U R∗ = RU 2 R∗
and

F ∗ F = U R∗ RU = U 2 .

Therefore, RU 2 R∗ = U 2 , and both are nonnegative and self adjoint. Therefore, the square
roots of both sides must be equal by the uniqueness part of the theorem on fractional powers.
It follows that the square root of the ﬁrst, RU R∗ must equal the square root of the second,
U. Therefore, RU R∗ = U and so RU = U R. This proves the theorem in one case. The other
case in which W and Q commute is left as an exercise. 

13.7

An Application To Statistics

A random vector is a function X : Ω → Rp where Ω is a probability space. This means
that there exists a σ algebra of measurable sets F and a probability measure P : F → [0, 1].
In practice, people often don’t worry too much about the underlying probability space and
instead pay more attention to the distribution measure of the random variable. For E a
suitable subset of Rp , this measure gives the probability that X has values in E. There
are often excellent reasons for believing that a random vector is normally distributed. This
means that the probability that X has values in a set E is given by

)
∫

∗ −1
exp − (x − m) Σ (x − m) dx
p/2

2
E (2π)
det (Σ)
The expression in the integral is called the normal probability density function. There are
two parameters, m and Σ where m is called the mean and Σ is called the covariance matrix.
It is a symmetric matrix which has all real eigenvalues which are all positive. While it may
be reasonable to assume this is the distribution, in general, you won’t know m and Σ and
in order to use this formula to predict anything, you would need to know these quantities.
What people do to estimate these is to take n independent observations x1 , · · · , xn and
try to predict what m and Σ should be based on these observations. One criterion used for
making this determination is the method of maximum likelihood. In this method, you seek
to choose the two parameters in such a way as to maximize the likelihood which is given as

This part follows fairly easily from taking the ln and then setting partial derivatives equal to
0. The estimation of Σ is harder. However, it is not too hard using the theorems presented
above. I am following a nice discussion given in Wikipedia. It will make use of Theorem
7.5.3 on the trace as well as the theorem about the square root of a linear transformation

and so λi = n. It follows from the above that
Σ = S 1/2 B −1 S 1/2
where B −1 has only the eigenvalues 1/n. It follows B −1 must equal the diagonal matrix
which has 1/n down the diagonal. The reason for this is that B is similar to a diagonal
matrix because it is symmetric. Thus B = P −1 n1 IP = n1 I because the identity commutes

The Singular Value Decomposition

In this section, A will be an m × n matrix. To begin with, here is a simple lemma.
Lemma 13.8.1 Let A be an m × n matrix. Then A∗ A is self adjoint and all its eigenvalues
are nonnegative.
Proof: It is obvious that A∗ A is self adjoint. Suppose A∗ Ax = λx. Then λ |x| =
(λx, x) = (A∗ Ax, x) = (Ax,Ax) ≥ 0. 

Deﬁnition 13.8.2 Let A be an m × n matrix. The singular values of A are the square roots
of the positive eigenvalues of A∗ A.
With this deﬁnition and lemma here is the main theorem on the singular value decomposition. In all that follows, I will write the following partitioned matrix

and the bottom row of zero matrices in the partitioned matrix, as well as the right columns
of zero matrices are each of the right size so that the resulting matrix is m × n. Either
could vanish completely. However, I will write it in the above form. It is easy to make the
necessary adjustments in the other two cases.
Theorem 13.8.3 Let A be an m × n matrix. Then there exist unitary matrices, U and V
of the appropriate size such that

(Avi , Avi ) = (A∗ Avi , vi ) = (0, vi ) = 0.
For i = 1, · · · , k, deﬁne ui ∈ Fm by

Approximation In The Frobenius Norm

The Frobenius norm is one of many norms for a matrix. It is arguably the most obvious of
all norms. Here is its deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 13.9.1 Let A be a complex m × n matrix. Then
||A||F ≡ (trace (AA∗ ))

1/2

Also this norm comes from the inner product
(A, B)F ≡ trace (AB ∗ )
2

Thus ||A||F is easily seen to equal
in Fm×n .

||Σ||F = ||A||F

(13.20)

and the following hold for the Frobenius norm. If U, V are unitary and of the right size,
||U A||F = ||A||F , ||U AV ||F = ||A||F .

(13.21)

Proof: From the deﬁnition and letting U, V be unitary and of the right size,
||U A||F ≡ trace (U AA∗ U ∗ ) = trace (AA∗ ) = ||A||F
2

Also,

2

||AV ||F ≡ trace (AV V ∗ A∗ ) = trace (AA∗ ) = ||A||F .

It follows

||U AV ||F = ||AV ||F = ||A||F .

Why is the singular value decomposition important? It implies
(
)
σ 0
A=U
V∗
0 0
where σ is the diagonal matrix having the singular values down the diagonal. Now sometimes
A is a huge matrix, 1000×2000 or something like that. This happens in applications to
situations where the entries of A describe a picture. What also happens is that most of the
singular values are very small. What if you deleted those which were very small, say for all
i ≥ l and got a new matrix
( ′

σ 0
A′ ≡ U

Then the entries of A′ would end up being close to the entries of A but there is much less
information to keep track of. This turns out to be very useful. More precisely, letting

Thus A is approximated by A where A has rank l < r. In fact, it is also true that out

possible. Lemma 12.5.1 shows that there is a solution to this problem which can be found by
solving the system A∗ Ax = A∗ y. Each x which solves this system solves the minimization
problem as was shown in the lemma just mentioned. Now consider this equation for the

Proposition 13.11.2 A+ y is the solution to the problem of minimizing |Ax − y| for all x
which has smallest norm. Thus
AA+ y − y ≤ |Ax − y| for all x
and if x1 satisﬁes |Ax1 − y| ≤ |Ax − y| for all x, then |A+ y| ≤ |x1 | .

matrix which satisﬁes (13.24). This is the content of the following Theorem. The conditions
are sometimes called the Penrose conditions.
Theorem 13.11.4 Let A be an m × n matrix. Then a matrix A0 , is the Moore Penrose
inverse of A if and only if A0 satisﬁes
AA0 A = A, A0 AA0 = A0 , A0 A and AA0 are Hermitian.

(13.25)

Proof: From the above lemma, the Moore Penrose inverse satisﬁes (13.25). Suppose
then that A0 satisﬁes (13.25). It is necessary to verify that A0 = A+ . Recall that from the
singular value decomposition, there exist unitary matrices, U and V such that

Norms For Finite Dimensional
Vector Spaces
In this chapter, X and Y are ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces which have a norm. The
following is a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 14.0.1 A linear space X is a normed linear space if there is a norm deﬁned on
X, ||·|| satisfying
||x|| ≥ 0, ||x|| = 0 if and only if x = 0,
||x + y|| ≤ ||x|| + ||y|| ,
||cx|| = |c| ||x||
whenever c is a scalar. A set, U ⊆ X, a normed linear space is open if for every p ∈ U,
there exists δ > 0 such that
B (p, δ) ≡ {x : ||x − p|| < δ} ⊆ U.
Thus, a set is open if every point of the set is an interior point.
To begin with recall the Cauchy Schwarz inequality which is stated here for convenience
in terms of the inner product space, Cn .
Theorem 14.0.2 The following inequality holds for ai and bi ∈ C.

Deﬁnition 14.0.3 Let (X, ||·||) be a normed linear space and let {xn }n=1 be a sequence of
vectors. Then this is called a Cauchy sequence if for all ε > 0 there exists N such that if
m, n ≥ N, then
||xn − xm || < ε.
This is written more brieﬂy as
lim ||xn − xm || = 0.

m,n→∞

Deﬁnition 14.0.4 A normed linear space, (X, ||·||) is called a Banach space if it is complete. This means that, whenever, {xn } is a Cauchy sequence there exists a unique x ∈ X
such that limn→∞ ||x − xn || = 0.

NORMS FOR FINITE DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional normed linear space with norm ||·|| where the ﬁeld of
scalars is denoted by F and is understood to be either R or C. Let {v1 ,· · · , vn } be a basis
for X. If x ∈ X, denote by xi the ith component of x with respect to this basis. Thus

For A ∈ L (X, Y ) , the space of linear mappings from X to Y,
||A|| ≡ sup{|Ax| : |x| ≤ 1}.

(14.2)

The ﬁrst thing to show is that the two norms, ||·|| and |·| , are equivalent. This means
the conclusion of the following theorem holds.
Theorem 14.0.6 Let (X, ||·||) be a ﬁnite dimensional normed linear space and let |·| be
described above relative to a given basis, {v1 , · · · , vn } . Then |·| is a norm and there exist
constants δ, ∆ > 0 independent of x such that
δ ||x|| ≤ |x| ≤∆ ||x|| .

(14.3)

Proof: All of the above properties of a norm are obvious except the second, the triangle
inequality. To establish this inequality, use the Cauchy Schwarz inequality to write

This proves the ﬁrst half of the inequality.
Suppose the second half of the inequality is not valid. Then there exists a sequence
xk ∈ X such that
xk > k xk , k = 1, 2, · · · .
Then deﬁne
yk ≡

xk

|xk |

It follows
yk = 1,

yk > k yk .

(14.4)

Letting yik be the components of yk with respect to the given basis, it follows the vector
( k
)
y1 , · · · , ynk
is a unit vector in Fn . By the Heine Borel theorem, there exists a subsequence, still denoted
by k such that
( k
)
y1 , · · · , ynk → (y1 , · · · , yn ) .
It follows from (14.4) and this that for

but not all the yi equal zero. This contradicts the assumption that {v1 , · · · , vn } is a basis
and proves the second half of the inequality. 
Corollary 14.0.7 If (X, ||·||) is a ﬁnite dimensional normed linear space with the ﬁeld of
scalars F = C or R, then X is complete.
Proof: Let {xk } be a Cauchy sequence. Then letting the components of xk with respect
to the given basis be
xk1 , · · · , xkn ,
it follows from Theorem 14.0.6, that
( k
)
x1 , · · · , xkn
is a Cauchy sequence in Fn and so
( k

x1 , · · · , xkn → (x1 , · · · , xn ) ∈ Fn .
Thus,

Corollary 14.0.8 Suppose X is a ﬁnite dimensional linear space with the ﬁeld of scalars
either C or R and ||·|| and |||·||| are two norms on X. Then there exist positive constants, δ
and ∆, independent of x ∈ X such that
δ |||x||| ≤ ||x|| ≤ ∆ |||x||| .
Thus any two norms are equivalent.

NORMS FOR FINITE DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

This is very important because it shows that all questions of convergence can be considered relative to any norm with the same outcome.
Proof: Let {v1 , · · · , vn } be a basis for X and let |·| be the norm taken with respect to
this basis which was described earlier. Then by Theorem 14.0.6, there are positive constants
δ 1 , ∆1 , δ 2 , ∆2 , all independent of x ∈X such that
δ 2 |||x||| ≤ |x| ≤ ∆2 |||x||| ,
δ 1 ||x|| ≤ |x| ≤ ∆1 ||x|| .

Deﬁnition 14.0.9 Let X and Y be normed linear spaces with norms ||·||X and ||·||Y respectively. Then L (X, Y ) denotes the space of linear transformations, called bounded linear
transformations, mapping X to Y which have the property that
||A|| ≡ sup {||Ax||Y : ||x||X ≤ 1} < ∞.
Then ||A|| is referred to as the operator norm of the bounded linear transformation A.
It is an easy exercise to verify that ||·|| is a norm on L (X, Y ) and it is always the case
that
||Ax||Y ≤ ||A|| ||x||X .
Furthermore, you should verify that you can replace ≤ 1 with = 1 in the deﬁnition. Thus
||A|| ≡ sup {||Ax||Y : ||x||X = 1} .
Theorem 14.0.10 Let X and Y be ﬁnite dimensional normed linear spaces of dimension
n and m respectively and denote by ||·|| the norm on either X or Y . Then if A is any linear
function mapping X to Y, then A ∈ L (X, Y ) and (L (X, Y ) , ||·||) is a complete normed
linear space of dimension nm with
||Ax|| ≤ ||A|| ||x|| .
Proof: It is necessary to show the norm deﬁned on linear transformations really is a
norm. Again the ﬁrst and third properties listed above for norms are obvious. It remains to
show the second and verify ||A|| < ∞. Letting {v1 , · · · , vn } be a basis and |·| deﬁned with
respect to this basis as above, there exist constants δ, ∆ > 0 such that
δ ||x|| ≤ |x| ≤ ∆ ||x|| .
Then,
||A + B||

≡ sup{||(A + B) (x)|| : ||x|| ≤ 1}
≤ sup{||Ax|| : ||x|| ≤ 1} + sup{||Bx|| : ||x|| ≤ 1}
≡ ||A|| + ||B|| .

Note by Corollary 14.0.8 you can deﬁne a norm any way desired on any ﬁnite dimensional
linear space which has the ﬁeld of scalars R or C and any other way of deﬁning a norm on
this space yields an equivalent norm. Thus, it doesn’t much matter as far as notions of
convergence are concerned which norm is used for a ﬁnite dimensional space. In particular
in the space of m × n matrices, you can use the operator norm deﬁned above, or some
other way of giving this space a norm. A popular choice for a norm is the Frobenius norm
discussed earlier but reviewed here.
Deﬁnition 14.0.11 Make the space of m × n matrices into a Hilbert space by deﬁning
(A, B) ≡ tr (AB ∗ ) .
Another way of describing a norm for an n × n matrix is as follows.
Deﬁnition 14.0.12 Let A be an m × n matrix. Deﬁne the spectral norm of A, written as
||A||2 to be
{
}
max λ1/2 : λ is an eigenvalue of A∗ A .
That is, the largest singular value of A. (Note the eigenvalues of A∗ A are all positive because
if A∗ Ax = λx, then
λ (x, x) = (A∗ Ax, x) = (Ax,Ax) ≥ 0.)
Actually, this is nothing new. It turns out that ||·||2 is nothing more than the operator
norm for A taken with respect to the usual Euclidean norm,

Proposition 14.0.13 The following holds.

Note that equality occurs when the minimum value happens for t = 1 and this indicates

Now ||A||p may be considered as the operator norm of A taken with respect to ||·||p . In

The Condition Number

Let A ∈ L (X, X) be a linear transformation where X is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space
and consider the problem Ax = b where it is assumed there is a unique solution to this
problem. How does the solution change if A is changed a little bit and if b is changed a

little bit? This is clearly an interesting question because you often do not know A and b
exactly. If a small change in these quantities results in a large change in the solution, x,
then it seems clear this would be undesirable. In what follows ||·|| when applied to a linear
transformation will always refer to the operator norm.
Lemma 14.2.1 Let A, B ∈ L (X, X) where X is a normed vector space as above. Then for
||·|| denoting the operator norm,
||AB|| ≤ ||A|| ||B|| .
Proof: This follows from the deﬁnition. Letting ||x|| ≤ 1, it follows from Theorem
14.0.10
||ABx|| ≤ ||A|| ||Bx|| ≤ ||A|| ||B|| ||x|| ≤ ||A|| ||B||
and so
||AB|| ≡ sup ||ABx|| ≤ ||A|| ||B|| . 
||x||≤1

Lemma 14.2.2 Let A, B ∈ L (X, X) , A−1 ∈ L (X, X) , and suppose ||B|| < 1/ A−1 .

Then (A + B) exists and

The above formula makes sense because

a contradiction. This also shows I + A−1 B is one to one. Therefore, both (A + B) and

Since ||y|| ≤ 1 is arbitrary, this shows

Proof: It follows from the assumptions that
Ax − A1 x + A1 x − A1 x1 = b − b1 .
Hence
A1 (x − x1 ) = (A1 − A) x + b − b1 .
Now A1 = (A + (A1 − A)) and so by the above lemma, A−1
1 exists and so
−1
(x − x1 ) = A−1

= (A + (A1 − A))

By the estimate in Lemma 14.2.2,
||x − x1 || ≤

A−1
(||A1 − A|| ||x|| + ||b − b1 ||) .
1 − ||A−1 (A1 − A)||

Dividing by ||x|| ,

||A1 − A|| +

−1
Now b = Ax = A A b and so ||b|| ≤ ||A|| A b and so

||x|| = A−1 b ≥ ||b|| / ||A|| .
Therefore, from (14.7),
||x − x1 ||

which proves the proposition. 
This shows that the number, A−1 ||A|| , controls how sensitive the relative change in
the solution of Ax = b is to small changes in A and b. This number is called the condition
number. It is bad when it is large because a small relative change in b, for example could
yield a large relative change in x.
Recall that for A an n × n matrix, ||A||2 = σ 1 where σ 1 is the largest singular value. The
largest singular value of A−1 is therefore, 1/σ n where σ n is the smallest singular value of A.
Therefore, the condition number reduces to σ 1 /σ n , the ratio of the largest to the smallest
singular value of A.

The Spectral Radius

Even though it is in general impractical to compute the Jordan form, its existence is all that
is needed in order to prove an important theorem about something which is relatively easy
to compute. This is the spectral radius of a matrix.
Deﬁnition 14.3.1 Deﬁne σ (A) to be the eigenvalues of A. Also,
ρ (A) ≡ max (|λ| : λ ∈ σ (A))
The number, ρ (A) is known as the spectral radius of A.
Recall the following symbols and their meaning.
lim sup an , lim inf an
n→∞

n→∞

They are respectively the largest and smallest limit points of the sequence {an } where ±∞
is allowed in the case where the sequence is unbounded. They are also deﬁned as
lim sup an
n→∞

lim inf an
n→∞

≡
≡

lim (sup {ak : k ≥ n}) ,

n→∞

lim (inf {ak : k ≥ n}) .

n→∞

Thus, the limit of the sequence exists if and only if these are both equal to the same real
number.
Lemma 14.3.2 Let J be a p × p Jordan matrix


where ρ = max {|λk | , k = 1, . . . , n}. Here the norm is deﬁned to equal

||BC|| ≤ p ||B|| ||C||
which follows from a simple computation. Now

because each Nk has only zero terms on the main diagonal. Therefore, some term in the
matrix has absolute value at least as large as 1. Now also, since Nkp = 0, the norm of
the matrix in the above is dominated by an expression of the form Cnp where C is some
constant which does not depend on n. This is because a typical block in the above matrix
is of the form

In case ρ = 0 so that all the eigenvalues equal zero, it follows that J n = 0 for all n > p.

and taking the seventh root of the largest entry gives

Here the norm refers to any of the norms deﬁned on L (X, Y ) . By Corollary 14.0.8 and

Then from the diﬀerential equation,
(a + ib) (u + iv) = u′ + iv ′
and equating real and imaginary parts,
u′ = au − bv, v ′ = av + bu.

and so, multiplying both sides by e−ct you get
d ( −ct )
ye

and so ye−ct equals a constant which must be 1 because of the initial condition y (0) = 1.
Thus

u + v 2 (t) = e2at
and taking square roots yields the desired conclusion. 
Deﬁnition 14.4.4 The function in Corollary 14.4.3 given by that power series is denoted
as
exp (λt) or eλt .
The next lemma is normally discussed in advanced calculus courses but is proved here
for the convenience of the reader. It is known as the root test.
Deﬁnition 14.4.5 For {an } any sequence of real numbers
lim sup an ≡ lim (sup {ak : k ≥ n})
n→∞

n→∞

Similarly
lim inf an ≡ lim (inf {ak : k ≥ n})
n→∞

n→∞

In case An is an increasing (decreasing) sequence which is unbounded above (below) then it
is understood that limn→∞ An = ∞(−∞) respectively. Thus either of lim sup or lim inf can
equal +∞ or −∞. However, the important thing about these is that unlike the limit, these
always exist.
It is convenient to think of these as the largest point which is the limit of some subsequence of {an } and the smallest point which is the limit of some subsequence of {an }
respectively. Thus limn→∞ an exists and equals some point of [−∞, ∞] if and only if the
two are equal.
Lemma 14.4.6 Let {ap } be a sequence of nonnegative terms and let
r = lim sup a1/p
p .
p→∞

∑∞

Then if r < 1, it follows the series, k=1 ak converges and if r > 1, then ap fails to converge
to 0 so the series diverges. If A is an n × n matrix and
1 < lim sup ||Ap ||

1/p

,

(14.10)

p→∞

then

∑∞
k=0

Ak fails to converge.

Proof: Suppose r < 1. Then there exists N such that if p > N,
a1/p
<R
p
where r < R < ∑
1. Therefore, for
all such p, ap < Rp and so by comparison with the
∑∞
p
geometric series,
R , it follows p=1 ap converges.

Next suppose r > 1. Then letting 1 < R < r, it follows there are inﬁnitely many values
of p at which
R < a1/p
p
which implies Rp < ap , showing that ap cannot converge to 0 and so the series cannot
converge either.
p
To see the last claim, if {(14.10)

p
Now denote by σ (A) the collection of all numbers of the form λp where λ ∈ σ (A) .
Lemma 14.4.7 σ (Ap ) = σ (A)

p

Proof: In dealing with σ (Ap ) , is suﬃces to deal with σ (J p ) where J is the Jordan form
of A because J p and Ap are similar. Thus if λ ∈ σ (Ap ) , then λ ∈ σ (J p ) and so λ = α
where α is one of the entries on the main diagonal of J p . These entries are of the form λp
p
p
where λ ∈ σ (A). Thus λ ∈ σ (A) and this shows σ (Ap ) ⊆ σ (A) .
p
Now take α ∈ σ (A) and consider α .
(
)
αp I − Ap = αp−1 I + · · · + αAp−2 + Ap−1 (αI − A)
and so αp I − Ap fails to be one to one which shows that αp ∈ σ (Ap ) which shows that
p
σ (A) ⊆ σ (Ap ) . 

Iterative Methods For Linear Systems

Consider the problem of solving the equation
Ax = b

(14.11)

where A is an n × n matrix. In many applications, the matrix A is huge and composed
mainly of zeros. For such matrices, the method of Gauss elimination (row operations) is
not a good way to solve the system because the row operations can destroy the zeros and
storing all those zeros takes a lot of room in a computer. These systems are called sparse.
To solve them, it is common to use an iterative technique. I am following the treatment
given to this subject by Nobel and Daniel [20].
Deﬁnition 14.5.1 The Jacobi iterative technique, also called the method of simultaneous
corrections is deﬁned as follows. Let x1 be an initial vector, say the zero vector or some
other vector. The method generates a succession of vectors, x2 , x3 , x4 , · · · and hopefully this
sequence of vectors will converge to the solution to (14.11). The vectors in this list are called
iterates and they are obtained according to the following procedure. Letting A = (aij ) ,
∑
aii xr+1
=−
aij xrj + bi .

The matrix on the left in (14.13) is obtained by retaining the main diagonal of A and
setting every other entry equal to zero. The matrix on the right in (14.13) is obtained from
A by setting every diagonal entry equal to zero and retaining all the other entries unchanged.
Example 14.5.2 Use the Jacobi method to solve the system

Of course this is solved most easily using row reductions. The Jacobi method is useful
when the matrix is 1000×1000 or larger. This example is just to illustrate how the method
works. First lets solve it using row operations. The augmented matrix is

so you see that with no care at all and only 6 iterations, an approximate solution has been
obtained which is not too far oﬀ from the actual solution.
It is important to realize that a computer would use (14.12) directly. Indeed, writing
the problem in terms of matrices as I have done above destroys every beneﬁt of the method.
However, it makes it a little easier to see what is happening and so this is why I have
presented it in this way.
Deﬁnition 14.5.3 The Gauss Seidel method, also called the method of successive corrections is given as follows. For A = (aij ) , the iterates for the problem Ax = b are obtained

In words, you set every entry in the original matrix which is strictly above the main
diagonal equal to zero to obtain the matrix on the left. To get the matrix on the right,
you set every entry of A which is on or below the main diagonal equal to zero. Using the
iteration procedure of (14.15) directly, the Gauss Seidel method makes use of the very latest
information which is available at that stage of the computation.
The following example is the same as the example used to illustrate the Jacobi method.

The iterates seem to be getting farther from the actual solution. Why is the process which
worked so well in the other examples not working here? A better question might be: Why
does either process ever work at all?
Both iterative procedures for solving
Ax = b

(14.17)

are of the form
Bxr+1 = −Cxr + b
where A = B + C. In the Jacobi procedure, the matrix C was obtained by setting the
diagonal of A equal to zero and leaving all other entries the same while the matrix B was
obtained by making every entry of A equal to zero other than the diagonal entries which are
left unchanged. In the Gauss Seidel procedure, the matrix B was obtained from A by making
every entry strictly above the main diagonal equal to zero and leaving the others unchanged
and C was obtained from A by making every entry on or below the main diagonal equal to
zero and leaving the others unchanged. Thus in the Jacobi procedure, B is a diagonal matrix
while in the Gauss Seidel procedure, B is lower triangular. Using matrices to explicitly solve
for the iterates, yields
xr+1 = −B −1 Cxr + B −1 b.
(14.18)
This is what you would never have the computer do but this is what will allow the statement
of a theorem which gives the condition for convergence of these and all other similar methods.
Recall the deﬁnition of the spectral radius of M, ρ (M ) , in Deﬁnition 14.3.1 on Page 348.

Theorem 14.5.6 Suppose ρ B −1 C < 1. Then the iterates in (14.18) converge to the
unique solution of (14.17).
I will prove this theorem in the next section. The proof depends on analysis which should
not be surprising because it involves a statement about convergence of sequences.
What is an easy to verify suﬃcient condition which will imply the above holds? It is easy
to give one in the
∑case of the Jacobi method. Suppose the matrix A is diagonally dominant.
That is |aii | > j̸=i |aij | . Then B would be the diagonal matrix consisting of the entries
|aii | . You can see then that every entry of B −1 C has absolute value less than 1. Thus if
you let the norm B −1 C ∞ be given by the maximum of the absolute values of the entries
of the matrix, then B −1 C ∞ = r < 1. Also, by equivalence of norms it follows there exist
positive constants δ, ∆ such that
δ ||·|| ≤ ||·||∞ ≤ ∆ ||·||
(
)−1
where here ||·|| is an operator norm. It follows that if |λ| ≥ 1, then λI − B −1 C
exists.

Theory Of Convergence

Deﬁnition 14.6.1 A normed vector space, E with norm ||·|| is called a Banach space if it
is also complete. This means that every Cauchy sequence converges. Recall that a sequence
∞
{xn }n=1 is a Cauchy sequence if for every ε > 0 there exists N such that whenever m, n > N,
||xn − xm || < ε.
Thus whenever {xn } is a Cauchy sequence, there exists x such that
lim ||x − xn || = 0.

n→∞

Example 14.6.2 Let Ω be a nonempty subset of a normed linear space, F. Denote by
BC (Ω; E) the set of bounded continuous functions having values in E where E is a Banach
space. Then deﬁne the norm on BC (Ω; E) by
||f || ≡ sup {||f (x)||E : x ∈ Ω} .

14.6. THEORY OF CONVERGENCE

Lemma 14.6.3 The space BC (Ω; E) with the given norm is a Banach space.
Proof: It is obvious ||·|| is a norm. It only remains to verify BC (Ω; E) is complete. Let
{fn } be a Cauchy sequence. Then pick x ∈ Ω.
||fn (x) − fm (x)||E ≤ ||fn − fm || < ε
whenever m, n are large enough. Thus, for each x, {fn (x)} is a Cauchy sequence in E.
Since E is complete, it follows there exists a function, f deﬁned on Ω such that f (x) =
limn→∞ fn (x).
It remains to verify that f ∈ BC (Ω; E) and that ||f − fn || → 0. I will ﬁrst show that
(
)
lim sup {||f (x) − fn (x)||E } = 0.
(14.19)
n→∞

x∈Ω

From this it will follow that f is bounded. Then I will show that f is continuous and
||f − fn || → 0. Let ε > 0 be given and let N be such that for m, n > N
||fn − fm || < ε/3.
Then it follows that for all x,
||f (x) − fm (x)||E = lim ||fn (x) − fm (x)||E ≤ ε/3
n→∞

Therefore, for m > N,
sup {||f (x) − fm (x)||E } ≤

x∈Ω

ε
< ε.
3

This proves (14.19). Then by the triangle inequality and letting N be as just described,
pick m > N. Then for any x ∈ Ω
||f (x)||E ≤ ||fm (x)||E + ε ≤ ||fm || + ε.
Hence f is bounded. Now pick x ∈ Ω and let ε > 0 be given and N be as above. Then
||f (x) − f (y)||E

≤ ||f (x) − fm (x)||E + ||fm (x) − fm (y)||E + ||fm (y) − f (y)||E
ε
ε
≤
+ ||fm (x) − fm (y)||E + .
3
3

Now by continuity of fm , the middle term is less than ε/3 whenever ||x − y|| is suﬃciently
small. Therefore, f is also continuous. Finally, from the above,
||f − fn || ≤

ε
3

whenever n > N and so limn→∞ ||f − fn || = 0 as claimed. 
The most familiar example of a Banach space is Fn . The following lemma is of great
importance so it is stated in general.
Lemma 14.6.4 Suppose T : E → E where E is a Banach space with norm |·|. Also suppose
|T x − T y| ≤ r |x − y|

(14.20)

for some r ∈ (0, 1). Then there exists a unique ﬁxed point, x ∈ E such that
T x = x.

Letting x1 ∈ E, this ﬁxed point, x, is the limit of the sequence of iterates,
x1 , T x1 , T 2 x1 , · · · .

(14.22)

In addition to this, there is a nice estimate which tells how close x1 is to x in terms of
things which can be computed.
x1 − x ≤

x1 − T x1 .
1−r

(14.23)

{

Proof: This follows easily when it is shown that the above sequence, T k x1 k=1 is a
Cauchy sequence. Note that
T 2 x1 − T x1 ≤ r T x1 − x1 .
Suppose
T k x1 − T k−1 x1 ≤ rk−1 T x1 − x1 .

(14.24)

Then
T k+1 x1 − T k x1

≤ r T k x1 − T k−1 x1
≤ rrk−1 T x1 − x1 = rk T x1 − x1 .

By induction, this shows that for all k ≥ 2, (14.24) is valid. Now let k > l ≥ N.

which converges to 0 as N → ∞. Therefore, this is a Cauchy sequence so it must converge
to x ∈ E. Then
x = lim T k x1 = lim T k+1 x1 = T lim T k x1 = T x.
k→∞

k→∞

k→∞

This shows the existence of the ﬁxed point. To show it is unique, suppose there were
another one, y. Then
|x − y| = |T x − T y| ≤ r |x − y|
and so x = y.
It remains to verify the estimate.
x1 − x

≤

x1 − T x1 + T x1 − x = x1 − T x1 + T x1 − T x

≤

x1 − T x1 + r x1 − x

and solving the inequality for x1 − x gives the estimate desired. 
The following corollary is what will be used to prove the convergence condition for the
various iterative procedures.
Corollary 14.6.5 Suppose T : E → E, for some constant C
|T x − T y| ≤ C |x − y| ,
for all x, y ∈ E, and for some N ∈ N,
T N x − T N y ≤ r |x − y| ,
for all x, y ∈ E where r ∈{(0, 1).}Then there exists a unique ﬁxed point for T and it is still
the limit of the sequence, T k x1 for any choice of x1 .

Proof: From Lemma 14.6.4 there exists a unique ﬁxed point for T N denoted here as x.
Therefore, T N x = x. Now doing T to both sides,
T N T x = T x.
By uniqueness, T x = x because the above equation shows T x is a ﬁxed point of T N and
there is only one ﬁxed point of T N . In fact, there is only one ﬁxed point of T because a
ﬁxed point of T is automatically a ﬁxed point of T N .
It remains to show T k x1 → x, the unique ﬁxed point of T N . If this does not happen,
there exists ε > 0 and a subsequence, still denoted by T k such that
T k x1 − x ≥ ε
Now k = jk N + rk where rk ∈ {0, · · · , N − 1} and jk is a positive integer such that
limk→∞ jk = ∞. Then there exists a single r ∈ {0, · · · , N − 1} such that for inﬁnitely
many k, rk = r. Taking a further subsequence, still denoted by T k it follows
T jk N +r x1 − x ≥ ε

(14.25)

However,
T jk N +r x1 = T r T jk N x1 → T r x = x
and this contradicts (14.25). 
(

Theorem 14.6.6 Suppose ρ B −1 C < 1. Then the iterates in (14.18) converge to the
unique solution of (14.17).
Proof: Consider the iterates in (14.18). Let T x = B −1 Cx + b. Then
T kx − T ky =

B −1 C

)k

(
)k
(

x − B −1 C y ≤ B −1 C
|x − y| .

Here ||·|| refers to any of the operator norms. It doesn’t matter which one you pick because
they are all equivalent. I am writing the (proof to
) indicate the operator norm taken with
respect to the usual norm on E. Since ρ B −1 C < 1, it follows from Gelfand’s theorem,
Theorem 14.3.3 on Page 349, there exists N such that if k ≥ N, then for some r1/k < 1,
(

B −1 C

)k

< r1/k < 1.

Consequently,
T N x − T N y ≤ r |x − y| .
Also |T x − T y| ≤ B −1 C |x − y| and so Corollary 14.6.5 applies and gives the conclusion
of this theorem. 

and similar things. Hint: On showing the triangle inequality, it will help if you use
the fact that

You should show this also.

Hint: w (t) = 0 u (s) ds. Then using the fundamental theorem of calculus, w (t)
satisﬁes the following.
u (t) − Kw (t) = w′ (t) − Kw (t) ≤ u0 , w (0) = 0.
Now use the usual techniques you saw in an introductory diﬀerential equations class.
Multiply both sides of the above inequality by e−Kt and note the resulting left side is
now a total derivative. Integrate both sides from 0 to t and see what you have got. If
you have problems, look ahead in the book. This inequality is proved later in Theorem

23. With Gronwall’s inequality and the integral deﬁned in Problem 21 with its properties
listed there, prove there is at most one solution to the initial value problem

24. Suppose A is a matrix which has the property that whenever µ ∈ σ (A) , Re µ < 0.
Consider the initial value problem
y′ = Ay, y (0) = y0 .
The existence and uniqueness of a solution to this equation has been established above
in preceding problems, Problem 17 to 23. Show that in this case where the real parts
of the eigenvalues are all negative, the solution to the initial value problem satisﬁes
lim y (t) = 0.

t→∞

Hint: A nice way to approach this problem is to show you can reduce it to the
consideration of the initial value problem
z′ = Jε z, z (0) = z0
where Jε is the modiﬁed Jordan canonical form where instead of ones down the main
diagonal, there are ε down the main diagonal (Problem 19). Then
z′ = Dz + Nε z
where D is the diagonal matrix obtained from the eigenvalues of A and Nε is a nilpotent
matrix commuting with D which is very small provided ε is chosen very small. Now
let Ψ (t) be the solution of
Ψ′ = −DΨ, Ψ (0) = I

Thus Ψ (t) commutes with D and Nε . Tell why. Next argue

It follows

||Ψ (t) z (t)|| ≤ ||z0 || +

||Nε || ||Ψ (s) z (s)|| ds.

It follows from Gronwall’s inequality
||Ψ (t) z (t)|| ≤ ||z0 || e||Nε ||t

Numerical Methods For Finding
Eigenvalues
15.1

The Power Method For Eigenvalues

This chapter discusses numerical methods for ﬁnding eigenvalues. However, to do this
correctly, you must include numerical analysis considerations which are distinct from linear
algebra. The purpose of this chapter is to give an introduction to some numerical methods
without leaving the context of linear algebra. In addition, some examples are given which
make use of computer algebra systems. For a more thorough discussion, you should see
books on numerical methods in linear algebra like some listed in the references.
Let A be a complex p × p matrix and suppose that it has distinct eigenvalues
{λ1 , · · · , λm }
and that |λ1 | > |λk | for all k. Also let the Jordan form of A be


J1


..
J =

.
Jm
with
Jk = λk Ik + Nk
where

Nkrk

̸= 0 but

Nkrk +1

= 0. Also let
P −1 AP = J, A = P JP −1 .

Now ﬁx x ∈ Fp . Take Ax and let s1 be the entry of the vector Ax which has largest
absolute value. Thus Ax/s1 is a vector y1 which has a component of 1 and every other
entry of this vector has magnitude no larger than 1. If the scalars {s1 , · · · , sn−1 } and
vectors {y1 , · · · , yn−1 } have been obtained, let
yn ≡

Ayn−1
sn

where sn is the entry of Ayn−1 which has largest absolute value. Thus
yn =

because N1r1 +1 = 0. Therefore, the vector in (15.3) is an eigenvector and yn is approximately

With this preparation, here is a theorem.
Theorem 15.1.1 Let A be a complex p × p matrix such that the eigenvalues are
{λ1 , λ2 , · · · , λr }
with |λ1 | > |λj | for all j ̸= 1. Then for x a given vector, let
y1 =

Ax
s1

where s1 is an entry of Ax which has the largest absolute value. If the scalars {s1 , · · · , sn−1 }
and vectors {y1 , · · · , yn−1 } have been obtained, let
yn ≡

Ayn−1
sn

where sn is the entry of Ayn−1 which has largest absolute value. Then it is probably the case
that {sn } will converge to λ1 and {yn } will converge to an eigenvector associated with λ1 .
Proof: Consider the claim about sn+1 . It was shown above that
( −r1 r1 ( −1 )
)
λ1 N1 P x m1
z≡P
0
is an eigenvector for λ1 . Let zl be the entry of z which has largest absolute value. Then for
large n, it will probably be the case that the entry of yn which has largest absolute value
will also be in the lth slot. This follows from (15.2) because for large n, zn will be very
small, smaller than the largest entry of the top part of the vector in that expression. Then,
since m (n) is very small, the result follows if z has a well deﬁned entry which has largest
absolute value. Now from the above construction,
( )
λn+1

sn+1 yn+1 ≡ Ayn ≈

In summary, here is the procedure.
Finding the largest eigenvalue with its eigenvector.
1. Start with a vector, u1 which you hope is not unlucky.
2. If uk is known,
uk+1 =

Auk
sk+1

where sk+1 is the entry of Auk which has largest absolute value.
3. When the scaling factors sk are not changing much, sk+1 will be close to the eigenvalue
and uk+1 will be close to an eigenvector.
4. Check your answer to see if it worked well.

15.1.1

The Shifted Inverse Power Method

This method can ﬁnd various eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It is a signiﬁcant generalization
of the above simple procedure and yields very good results. One can ﬁnd complex eigenvalues
using this method. The situation is this: You have a number, α which is close to λ, some
eigenvalue of an n × n matrix A. You don’t know λ but you know that α is closer to λ
than to any other eigenvalue. Your problem is to ﬁnd both λ and an eigenvector which goes
with λ. Another way to look at this is to start with α and seek the eigenvalue λ, which is
closest to α along with an eigenvector associated with λ. If α is an eigenvalue of A, then
you have what you want. Therefore, I will always assume α is not an eigenvalue of A and
−1
so (A − αI) exists. The method is based on the following lemma.
n

Lemma 15.1.3 Let {λk }k=1 be the eigenvalues of A. If xk is an eigenvector of A for the
−1
eigenvalue λk , then xk is an eigenvector for (A − αI)
corresponding to the eigenvalue
1
if
.
Conversely,
λk −α
1
−1
(A − αI) y =
y
(15.4)
λ−α
and y ̸= 0, then Ay = λy.
Proof: Let λk and xk be as described in the statement of the lemma. Then
(A − αI) xk = (λk − α) xk
and so

1
−1
xk = (A − αI) xk .
λk − α

1
[Ay − αy] . Solving for Ay leads to Ay = λy. 
Suppose (15.4). Then y = λ−α
1
Now assume α is closer to λ than to any other eigenvalue. Then the magnitude of λ−α
−1
is greater than the magnitude of all the other eigenvalues of (A − αI) . Therefore, the
−1
1
1
power method applied to (A − αI) will yield λ−α . You end up with sn+1 ≈ λ−α
and
solve for λ.

Here is how you use this method to ﬁnd the eigenvalue and eigenvector closest

4. When the scaling factors, sk are not changing much and the uk are not changing much,
ﬁnd the approximation to the eigenvalue by solving
sk+1 =

1
λ−α

for λ. The eigenvector is approximated by uk+1 .
5. Check your work by multiplying by the original matrix to see how well what you have
found works.

These scaling factors are pretty close after these few iterations. Therefore, the predicted
eigenvalue is obtained by solving the following for λ.

which gives λ = −6. 01. You see this is pretty close. In this case the eigenvalue closest to
−7 was −6.

If you use your graphing calculator to graph this polynomial, you ﬁnd there is an eigenvalue
somewhere between −.9 and −.8 and that this is the middle eigenvalue. Of course you could
zoom in and ﬁnd it very accurately without much trouble but what about the eigenvector

there will be only the zero solution because the matrix on the left will be invertible and the

because all these are only approximations to the eigenvalue and so the matrix in the above
is nonsingular for all of these. Therefore, you will only get the zero solution and

This is only a 3×3 matrix and so it is not hard to estimate the eigenvalues. Just get
the characteristic equation, graph it using a calculator and zoom in to ﬁnd the eigenvalues.
If you do this, you ﬁnd there is an eigenvalue near −1.2, one near −.4, and one near 5.5.
(The characteristic equation is 2 + 8λ + 4λ2 − λ3 = 0.) Of course I have no idea what the
eigenvectors are.
Lets ﬁrst try to ﬁnd the eigenvector and a better approximation for the eigenvalue near
−1.2. In this case, let α = −1.2. Then

approximate eigenvector obtained.

You can see the vector didn’t change much and so the next scaling factor will not be much

NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FINDING EIGENVALUES

You can see that for practical purposes, this has found the eigenvalue closest to −1. 218 5
and the corresponding eigenvector.
The other eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be found similarly. In the case of −.4, you
could let α = −.4 and then


8. 064 516 1 × 10−2 −9. 274 193 5 6. 451 612 9

(A − αI) = 

3. 629 032 3 −2. 741 935 5
Following the procedure of the power method, you ﬁnd that after about 5 iterations, the
scaling factor is 9. 757 313 9, they are not changing much, and


−. 781 224 8

u5 = 

Thus the approximate eigenvalue is

It works pretty well. For practical purposes, the eigenvalue and eigenvector have now been
found. If you want better accuracy, you could just continue iterating.
Next I will ﬁnd the eigenvalue and eigenvector for the eigenvalue near 5.5. In this case,


29. 2 16. 8 23. 2

(A − αI) =  19. 2 10. 8 15. 2  .

As before, I have no idea what the eigenvector is but I am tired of always using (1, 1, 1)
and I don’t want to give the impression that you always need to start with this vector.
T
Therefore, I shall let u1 = (1, 2, 3) . Also, I will begin by raising the matrix to a power.

15.1.3

Complex Eigenvalues

What about complex eigenvalues? If your matrix is real, you won’t see these by graphing
the characteristic equation on your calculator. Will the shifted inverse power method ﬁnd
these eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors? The answer is yes. However, for a real
matrix, you must pick α to be complex. This is because the eigenvalues occur in conjugate
pairs so if you don’t pick it complex, it will be the same distance between any conjugate
pair of complex numbers and so nothing in the above argument for convergence implies you
will get convergence to a complex number. Also, the process of iteration will yield only real
vectors and scalars.

and corresponding eigenvectors for the ma

Here the characteristic equation is λ3 − 5λ2 + 8λ − 6 = 0. One solution is λ = 3. The
other two are 1 + i and 1 − i. I will apply the process to α = i to ﬁnd the eigenvalue closest
to i.

This illustrates an interesting topic which leads to many related topics. If you have a
polynomial, x4 + ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, you can consider it as the characteristic polynomial of
a certain matrix, called a companion matrix. In this case,

The above example was just a companion matrix for λ3 − 5λ2 + 8λ − 6. You can see the
pattern which will enable you to obtain a companion matrix for any polynomial of the form
λn + a1 λn−1 + · · · + an−1 λ + an . This illustrates that one way to ﬁnd the complex zeros
of a polynomial is to use the shifted inverse power method on a companion matrix for the
polynomial. Doubtless there are better ways but this does illustrate how impressive this
procedure is. Do you have a better way?
Note that the shifted inverse power method is a way you can begin with something close
but not equal to an eigenvalue and end up with something close to an eigenvector.

Rayleigh Quotients And Estimates for Eigenvalues

There are many specialized results concerning the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for Hermitian
matrices. Recall a matrix A is Hermitian if A = A∗ where A∗ means to take the transpose
of the conjugate of A. In the case of a real matrix, Hermitian reduces to symmetric. Recall
also that for x ∈ Fn ,

|x| = x∗ x =

Recall the following corollary found on Page 179 which is stated here for convenience.
Corollary 15.1.8 If A is Hermitian, then all the eigenvalues of A are real and there exists
an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.

Thus for {xk }k=1 this orthonormal basis,

Basic Properties And Deﬁnition

Recall the theorem about the QR factorization in Theorem 5.7.5. It says that given an n×n
real matrix A, there exists a real orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such
that A = QR and that this factorization can be accomplished by a systematic procedure.
One such procedure was given in proving this theorem.
There is also a way to generalize the QR factorization to the case where A is just a
complex n × n matrix and Q is unitary
triangular with nonnegative entries
( while R is upper
)
on the main diagonal. Letting A = a1 · · · an be the matrix with the aj the columns,

each a vector in Cn , let Q1 be a unitary matrix which maps a1 to |a1 | e1 in the case that
a1 ̸= 0. If a1 = 0, let Q1 = I. Why does such a unitary matrix exist? Let
{a1 / |a1 | , u2 , · · · , un }
(
)
be an orthonormal basis and let Q1 |aa11 | = e1 , Q1 (u2 ) = e2 etc. Extend Q1 linearly. Then
Q1 preserves lengths so it is unitary by Lemma 13.6.1. Now

Now do the same thing for A1 obtaining an n − 1 × n − 1 unitary matrix Q′2 which when
multiplied on the left of A1 yields something of the form

Then multiplying A on the left by the product

this way
Qn Qn−1 · · · Q1 A = R
where R is upper triangular having all positive entries on the main diagonal. Then the
desired unitary matrix is
∗
Q = (Qn Qn−1 · · · Q1 )
II
The QR algorithm is described in the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 15.2.1 The QR algorithm is the following. In the description of this algorithm,
Q is unitary and R is upper triangular having nonnegative entries on the main diagonal.
Starting with A an n × n matrix, form

This algorithm was proposed by Francis in 1961. The sequence {Ak } is the desired
sequence of iterates. Now with the above deﬁnition of the algorithm, here are its properties.
The next lemma shows each of the Ak is unitarily similar to A and the amazing thing about
this algorithm is that often it becomes increasingly easy to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of the Ak .

NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FINDING EIGENVALUES

Lemma 15.2.2 Let A be an n × n matrix and let the Qk and Rk be as described in the algorithm. Then each Ak is unitarily similar to A and denoting by Q(k) the product Q1 Q2 · · · Qk
and R(k) the product Rk Rk−1 · · · R1 , it follows that
Ak = Q(k) R(k)
(The matrix on the left is A raised to the k th power.)
A = Q(k) Ak Q(k)∗ , Ak = Q(k)∗ AQ(k) .
Proof: From the algorithm, Rk+1 = Ak+1 Q∗k+1 and so
Ak = Qk+1 Rk+1 = Qk+1 Ak+1 Q∗k+1
Now iterating this, it follows
Ak−1 = Qk Ak Q∗k = Qk Qk+1 Ak+1 Q∗k+1 Q∗k
Ak−2 = Qk−1 Ak−1 Q∗k−1 = Qk−1 Qk Qk+1 Ak+1 Q∗k+1 Q∗k Q∗k−1
etc. Thus, after k − 2 more iterations,
A = Q(k+1) Ak+1 Q(k+1)∗
The product of unitary matrices is unitary and so this proves the ﬁrst claim of the lemma.
Now consider the part about Ak . From the algorithm, this is clearly true for k = 1.

(A = QR) Suppose then that
Ak = Q1 Q2 · · · Qk Rk Rk−1 · · · R1
What was just shown indicated
A = Q1 Q2 · · · Qk+1 Ak+1 Q∗k+1 Q∗k · · · Q∗1
and now from the algorithm, Ak+1 = Rk+1 Qk+1 and so
A = Q1 Q2 · · · Qk+1 Rk+1 Qk+1 Q∗k+1 Q∗k · · · Q∗1
Then
Ak+1 = AAk =

Proof: Let

(

Q = (q1 , · · · , qn ) , Q(k) = qk1 , · · · , qkn

where the q are the columns. Also denote by rij

and so

q1 → 1

Therefore,
qk1 → q1 .
Next consider the second column.
k k
k k
r12
q1 + r22
q2 → q2

Taking the inner product of both sides with qk1 it follows
(

k
lim r12

k→∞

Therefore,

Continuing this way, it follows

lim rij

k→∞

for all i ̸= j and

k

lim rjj

Thus Rk → I and Q → Q. This proves the ﬁrst part of the lemma.
The second part follows immediately. If QR = Q′ R′ = A where A−1 exists, then
(k)

−1

Q∗ Q′ = R (R′ )

and I need to show both sides of the above are equal to I. The left side of the above is
unitary and the right side is upper triangular having positive entries on the diagonal. This
is because the inverse of such an upper triangular matrix having positive entries on the
main diagonal is still upper triangular having positive entries on the main diagonal and
the product of two such upper triangular matrices gives another of the same form having
positive entries on the main diagonal. Suppose then that Q = R where Q is unitary and R
is upper triangular having positive entries on the main diagonal. Let Qk = Q and Rk = R.
It follows
IRk → R = Q
and so from the ﬁrst part, Rk → I but Rk = R and so R = I. Thus applying this to
−1
Q∗ Q′ = R (R′ ) yields both sides equal I. 

NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FINDING EIGENVALUES

A case of all this is of great
( interest. Suppose A
) has a largest eigenvalue λ which is
real. Then An is of the form An−1 a1 , · · · , An−1 an and so likely each of these columns
will be pointing roughly in the direction of an eigenvector of A which corresponds to this
eigenvalue. Then when you do the QR factorization of this, it follows from the fact that R
is upper triangular, that the ﬁrst column of Q will be a multiple of An−1 a1 and so will end
up being roughly parallel to the eigenvector desired. Also this will require the entries below
the top in the ﬁrst column of An = QT AQ will all be small because they will be of the form
qTi Aq1 ≈ λqTi q1 = 0. Therefore, An will be of the form
( ′
)
λ a
e B
where e is small. It follows that λ′ will be close to λ and q1 will be close to an eigenvector for
λ. Then if you like, you could do the same thing with the matrix B to obtain approximations
for the other eigenvalues. Finally, you could use the shifted inverse power method to get
more exact solutions.

15.2.2

The Case Of Real Eigenvalues

With these lemmas, it is possible to prove that for the QR algorithm and certain conditions,
the sequence Ak converges pointwise to an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues
of A down the diagonal. I will assume all the matrices are real here.
(
)
0 1
This convergence won’t always happen. Consider for example the matrix
.
1 0
You can verify quickly that the algorithm will return this matrix for each k. The problem
here is that, although the matrix has the two eigenvalues −1, 1, they have the same absolute
value. The QR algorithm works in somewhat the same way as the power method, exploiting
diﬀerences in the size of the eigenvalues.
If A has all real eigenvalues and you are interested in ﬁnding these eigenvalues along
with the corresponding eigenvectors, you could always consider A + λI instead where λ is
suﬃciently large and positive that A + λI has all positive eigenvalues. (Recall Gerschgorin’s
theorem.) Then if µ is an eigenvalue of A + λI with
(A + λI) x = µx
then
Ax = (µ − λ) x
so to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A you just subtract λ from the eigenvalues of A + λI. Thus
there is no loss of generality in assuming at the outset that the eigenvalues of A are all
positive. Here is the theorem. It involves a technical condition which will often hold. The
proof presented here follows [26] and is a special case of that presented in this reference.
Before giving the proof, note that the product of upper triangular matrices is upper
triangular. If they both have positive entries on the main diagonal so will the product.
Furthermore, the inverse of an upper triangular matrix is upper triangular. I will use these
simple facts without much comment whenever convenient.
Theorem 15.2.4 Let A be a real matrix having eigenvalues
λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λn > 0
and let

and suppose S −1 has an LU factorization. Then the matrices Ak in the QR algorithm
described above converge to an upper triangular matrix T ′ having the eigenvalues of A,

and

lim Ak = T ′ = Q′T AQ′

k→∞

Proof: From Lemma 15.2.2
Ak = Q(k) R(k) = SDk S −1

(15.12)

Let S = QR where this is just a QR factorization which is known to exist and let S −1 = LU
which is assumed to exist. Thus
Q(k) R(k) = QRDk LU
and so

(15.13)

Q(k) R(k) = QRDk LU = QRDk LD−k Dk U

That matrix in the middle, Dk LD−k satisﬁes
( k
)
D LD−k ij = λki Lij λ−k
for j ≤ i, 0 if j > i.
j
Thus for j < i the expression converges to 0 because λj > λi when this happens. When
i = j it reduces to 1. Thus the matrix in the middle is of the form
I + Ek
where Ek → 0. Then it follows
Ak = Q(k) R(k) = QR (I + Ek ) Dk U
(
)
= Q I + REk R−1 RDk U ≡ Q (I + Fk ) RDk U
where Fk → 0. Then let I + Fk = Qk Rk where this is another QR factorization. Then it
reduces to
Q(k) R(k) = QQk Rk RDk U
This looks really interesting because by Lemma 15.2.3 Qk → I and Rk → I because
Qk Rk = (I + Fk ) → I. So it follows QQk is an orthogonal matrix converging to Q while

known that the diagonal entries of this matrix are nonnegative because of the U . Let Λ be

that ΛU is an upper triangular matrix having positive diagonal entries. Note Λ2 = I and
also Λ commutes with a diagonal matrix. Thus

Now I claim the middle matrix in [·] is upper triangular and has all positive entries on the

k = QQk Λ → Q

where Q′ is essentially equal to Q but might have some of the columns multiplied by −1.
This is because Qk → I and so Qk Λ → Λ. Now by Lemma 15.2.3, it follows
Q(k) → Q′ , R(k) G−1
k → I.
It remains to verify Ak converges to an upper triangular matrix. Recall that from (15.12)
and the deﬁnition below this (S = QR)
A = SDS −1 = (QR) D (QR)

−1

Where T is an upper triangular matrix. This is because it is the product of upper triangular
matrices R, D, R−1 . Thus
QT AQ = T.
If you replace Q with Q′ in the above, it still results in an upper triangular matrix T ′ having
the same diagonal entries as T. This is because
T = QT AQ = (Q′ Λ) A (Q′ Λ) = ΛQ′T AQ′ Λ
T

and considering the iith entry yields

Recall from Lemma 15.2.2,
Ak = Q(k)T AQ(k)
Thus taking a limit and using the ﬁrst part,
Ak = Q(k)T AQ(k) → Q′T AQ′ = T ′ . 
An easy case is for A symmetric. Recall Corollary 7.4.13. By this corollary, there exists
an orthogonal (real unitary) matrix Q such that
QT AQ = D
where D is diagonal having the eigenvalues on the main diagonal decreasing in size from the
upper left corner to the lower right.

15.2. THE QR ALGORITHM

393

Corollary 15.2.5 Let A be a real symmetric n × n matrix having eigenvalues
λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λn > 0
and let Q be deﬁned by
QDQT = A, D = QT AQ,

(15.14)

where Q is orthogonal and D is a diagonal matrix having the eigenvalues on the main
diagonal decreasing in size from the upper left corner to the lower right. Let QT have an
LU factorization. Then in the QR algorithm, the matrices Q(k) converge to Q′ where Q′ is
the same as Q except having some columns multiplied by (−1) . Thus the columns of Q′ are
eigenvectors of A. The matrices Ak converge to D.
Proof: This follows from Theorem 15.2.4. Here S = Q, S −1 = QT . Thus
Q = S = QR
and R = I. By Theorem 15.2.4 and Lemma 15.2.2,
Ak = Q(k)T AQ(k) → Q′T AQ′ = QT AQ = D.
because formula (15.14) is unaﬀected by replacing Q with Q′ . 
When using the QR algorithm, it is not necessary to check technical condition about
S −1 having an LU factorization. The algorithm delivers a sequence of matrices which are
similar to the original one. If that sequence converges to an upper triangular matrix, then
the algorithm worked. Furthermore, the technical condition is suﬃcient but not necessary.
The algorithm will work even without the technical condition.

computer raise A to a power and then take the QR factorization of what results to get the
k th iteration using the above formula. Lets pick k = 10.

The QR Algorithm In The General Case

In the case where A has distinct positive eigenvalues it was shown above that under reasonable conditions related to a certain matrix having an LU factorization the QR algorithm
produces a sequence of matrices {Ak } which converges to an upper triangular matrix. What
if A is just an n×n matrix having possibly complex eigenvalues but A is nondefective? What
happens with the QR algorithm in this case? The short answer to this question is that the
Ak of the algorithm typically cannot converge. However, this does not mean the algorithm is not useful in ﬁnding eigenvalues. It turns out the sequence of matrices {Ak } have
the appearance of a block upper triangular matrix for large k in the sense that the entries

below the blocks on the main diagonal are small. Then looking at these blocks gives a way
to approximate the eigenvalues. An important example of the concept of a block triangular
matrix is the real Schur form for a matrix discussed in Theorem 7.4.6 but the concept as
described here allows for any size block centered on the diagonal.
First it is important to note a simple fact about unitary diagonal matrices. In what
follows Λ will denote a unitary matrix which is also a diagonal matrix. These matrices
are just the identity matrix with some of the ones replaced with a number of the form eiθ
for some θ. The important property of multiplication of any matrix by Λ on either side
is that it leaves all the zero entries the same and also preserves the absolute values of the
other entries. Thus a block triangular matrix multiplied by Λ on either side is still block
triangular. If the matrix is close to being block triangular this property of being close to a
block triangular matrix is also preserved by multiplying on either side by Λ. Other patterns
depending only on the size of the absolute value occurring in the matrix are also preserved
by multiplying on either side by Λ. In other words, in looking for a pattern in a matrix,
multiplication by Λ is irrelevant.
Now let A be an n × n matrix having real or complex entries. By Lemma 15.2.2 and the
assumption that A is nondefective, there exists an invertible S,
Ak = Q(k) R(k) = SDk S −1
where




and by rearranging the columns of S, D can be made such that
|λ1 | ≥ |λ2 | ≥ · · · ≥ |λn | .
Assume S −1 has an LU factorization. Then
Ak = SDk LU = SDk LD−k Dk U.
Consider the matrix in the middle, Dk LD−k . The ij th entry is of the form
 k

 λi Lij λ−k

and these all converge to 0 whenever |λi | < |λj | . Thus
Dk LD−k = (Lk + Ek )
where Lk is a lower triangular matrix which has all ones down the diagonal and some
subdiagonal terms of the form
(15.16)
λki Lij λ−k
j
for which |λi | = |λj | while Ek → 0. (Note the entries of Lk are all bounded independent of
k but some may fail to converge.) Then
Q(k) R(k) = S (Lk + Ek ) Dk U
Let
SLk = Qk Rk

where this is the QR factorization of SLk . Then

= (Qk Rk + SEk ) Dk U
)
(
= Qk I + Q∗k SEk Rk−1 Rk Dk U
= Qk (I + Fk ) Rk Dk U

where Fk → 0. Let I + Fk = Q′k Rk′ . Then
Q(k) R(k) = Qk Q′k Rk′ Rk Dk U
By Lemma 15.2.3

Q′k → I and Rk′ → I.

(15.18)

Now let Λk be a diagonal unitary matrix which has the property that
Λ∗k Dk U
is an upper triangular matrix which has all the diagonal entries positive. Then
Q(k) R(k) = Qk Q′k Λk (Λ∗k Rk′ Rk Λk ) Λ∗k Dk U
That matrix in the middle has all positive diagonal entries because it is itself an upper
triangular matrix, being the product of such, and is similar to the matrix Rk′ Rk which is
upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. By Lemma 15.2.3 again, this time using the
uniqueness assertion,
Q(k) = Qk Q′k Λk , R(k) = (Λ∗k Rk′ Rk Λk ) Λ∗k Dk U
Note the term Qk Q′k Λk must be real because the algorithm gives all Q(k) as real matrices.
By (15.18) it follows that for k large enough
Q(k) ≈ Qk Λk
where ≈ means the two matrices are close. Recall
Ak = Q(k)T AQ(k)
and so for large k,

∗

Ak ≈ (Qk Λk ) A (Qk Λk ) = Λ∗k Q∗k AQk Λk

As noted above, the form of Λ∗k Q∗k AQk Λk in terms of which entries are large and small is
not aﬀected by the presence of Λk and Λ∗k . Thus, in considering what form this is in, it
suﬃces to consider Q∗k AQk .
This could get pretty complicated but I will consider the case where
if |λi | = |λi+1 | , then |λi+2 | < |λi+1 | .

(15.19)

This is typical of the situation where the eigenvalues are all distinct and the matrix A is real
so the eigenvalues occur as conjugate pairs. Then in this case, Lk above is lower triangular
with some nonzero terms on the diagonal right below the main diagonal but zeros everywhere
else. Thus maybe
(Lk )s+1,s ̸= 0
Recall (15.17) which implies

Qk = SLk Rk−1

15.2. THE QR ALGORITHM

where Rk−1 is upper triangular. Also recall that from the deﬁnition of S in (15.15),
S −1 AS = D
and so the columns of S are eigenvectors of A, the ith being an eigenvector for λi . Now
from the form of Lk , it follows Lk Rk−1 is a block upper triangular matrix denoted by TB and
so Qk = STB . It follows from the above construction in (15.16) and the given assumption
on the sizes of the eigenvalues, there are ﬁnitely many 2 × 2 blocks centered on the main
diagonal along with possibly some diagonal entries. Therefore, for large k the matrix
Ak = Q(k)T AQ(k)
is approximately of the same form as that of
Q∗k AQk = TB−1 S −1 ASTB = TB−1 DTB
which is a block upper triangular matrix. As explained above, multiplication by the various
diagonal unitary matrices does not aﬀect this form. Therefore, for large k, Ak is approximately a block upper triangular matrix.
How would this change if the above assumption on the size of the eigenvalues were relaxed
but the matrix was still nondefective with appropriate matrices having an LU factorization
as above? It would mean the blocks on the diagonal would be larger. This immediately
makes the problem more cumbersome to deal with. However, in the case that the eigenvalues
of A are distinct, the above situation really is typical of what occurs and in any case can be
quickly reduced to this case.
To see this, suppose condition (15.19) is violated and λj , · · · , λj+p are complex eigenvalues having nonzero imaginary parts such that each has the same absolute value but they
are all distinct. Then let µ > 0 and consider the matrix A + µI. Thus the corresponding eigenvalues of A + µI are λj + µ, · · · , λj+p + µ. A short computation shows shows
|λj + µ| , · · · , |λj+p + µ| are all distinct and so the above situation of (15.19) is obtained. Of
course, if there are repeated eigenvalues, it may not be possible to reduce to the case above
and you would end up with large blocks on the main diagonal which could be diﬃcult to
deal with.
So how do you identify the eigenvalues? You know Ak and behold that it is close to a
block upper triangular matrix TB′ . You know Ak is also similar to A. Therefore, TB′ has
eigenvalues which are close to the eigenvalues of Ak and hence those of A provided k is
suﬃciently large. See Theorem 7.9.2 which depends on complex analysis or the exercise on
Page 197 which gives another way to see this. Thus you ﬁnd the eigenvalues of this block
triangular matrix TB′ and assert that these are good approximations of the eigenvalues of
Ak and hence to those of A. How do you ﬁnd the eigenvalues of a block triangular matrix?
This is easy from Lemma 7.4.5. Say


B1 · · ·
∗


TB′ = 

Then forming λI − TB′ and taking the determinant, it follows from Lemma 7.4.5 this equals
m
∏

det (λIj − Bj )

j=1

and so all you have to do is take the union of the eigenvalues for each Bj . In the case
emphasized here this is very easy because these blocks are just 2 × 2 matrices.

NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FINDING EIGENVALUES

How do you identify approximate eigenvectors from this? First try to ﬁnd the approximate eigenvectors for Ak . Pick an approximate eigenvalue λ, an exact eigenvalue for TB′ .
Then ﬁnd v solving TB′ v = λv. It follows since TB′ is close to Ak that
Ak v ≈ λv
and so
Q(k) AQ(k)T v = Ak v ≈ λv
Hence
AQ(k)T v ≈ λQ(k)T v
and so Q(k)T v is an approximation to the eigenvector which goes with the eigenvalue of A
which is close to λ.
Example 15.2.7 Here is a matrix.

It happens that the eigenvalues of this matrix are 1, 1 + i, 1 − i. Lets apply the QR algorithm
as if the eigenvalues were not known.

At this point the bottom two terms on the left part of the bottom row are both very
small so it appears the real eigenvalue is near 1.0. The complex eigenvalues are obtained

Example 15.2.8 The equation x4 + x3 + 4x2 + x− 2 = 0 has exactly two real solutions. You
can see this by graphing it. However, the rational root theorem from algebra shows neither
of these solutions are rational. Also, graphing it does not yield any information about the
complex solutions. Lets use the QR algorithm to approximate all the solutions, real and
complex.

Now this is similar to A and the eigenvalues are close to the eigenvalues obtained from
the two blocks on the diagonal. Of course the lower left corner of the bottom block is
vanishing but it is still fairly large so the eigenvalues are approximated by the solution to

The solution is

How close are the complex eigenvalues just obtained to giving a solution to the original
equation? Try −. 344 49 + 2. 033 9i . When this is plugged in it yields
−.00 12 + 2. 006 8 × 10−4 i
which is pretty close to 0. The real eigenvalues are also very close to the corresponding real
solutions to the original equation.
It seems like most of the attention to the QR algorithm has to do with ﬁnding ways
to get it to “converge” faster. Great and marvelous are the clever tricks which have been
proposed to do this but my intent is to present the basic ideas, not to go in to the numerous
reﬁnements of this algorithm. However, there is one thing which is usually done. It involves
reducing to the case of an upper Hessenberg matrix which is one which is zero below the
main sub diagonal. To see that every matrix is unitarily similar to an upper Hessenberg
matrix , see Problem 1 on Page 273. What follows is a construction which also proves this.

note that the matrix is upper Hessenberg means that Aij = 0 whenever i − j ≥ 2.

Since upper Hessenberg matrices stay that way in the algorithm and it is closer to
being upper triangular, it is reasonable to suppose the QR algorithm will yield good results
more quickly for this upper Hessenberg matrix than for the original matrix. This would be
especially true if the matrix is good sized. The other important thing to observe is that,
starting with an upper Hessenberg matrix, the algorithm will restrict the size of the blocks
which occur to being 2 × 2 blocks which are easy to deal with. These blocks allow you to
identify the complex roots.

Positive Matrices
Earlier theorems about Markov matrices were presented. These were matrices in which all
the entries were nonnegative and either the columns or the rows added to 1. It turns out
that many of the theorems presented can be generalized to positive matrices. When this is
done, the resulting theory is mainly due to Perron and Frobenius. I will give an introduction
to this theory here following Karlin and Taylor [18].
Deﬁnition A.0.1 For A a matrix or vector, the notation, A >> 0 will mean every entry
of A is positive. By A > 0 is meant that every entry is nonnegative and at least one is
positive. By A ≥ 0 is meant that every entry is nonnegative. Thus the matrix or vector
consisting only of zeros is ≥ 0. An expression like A >> B will mean A − B >> 0 with
similar modiﬁcations for > and ≥.
T
For the sake of this section only, deﬁne the following for x = (x1 , · · · , xn ) , a vector.
T

|x| ≡ (|x1 | , · · · , |xn |) .
Thus |x| is the vector which results by replacing each entry of x with its absolute value1 .
Also deﬁne for x ∈ Cn ,
∑
|xk | .
||x||1 ≡
k

Lemma A.0.2 Let A >> 0 and let x > 0. Then Ax >> 0.
∑
Proof: (Ax)i = j Aij xj > 0 because all the Aij > 0 and at least one xj > 0.
Lemma A.0.3 Let A >> 0. Deﬁne
S ≡ {λ : Ax > λx for some x >> 0} ,
and let
K ≡ {x ≥ 0 such that ||x||1 = 1} .
Now deﬁne
S1 ≡ {λ : Ax ≥ λx for some x ∈ K} .
Then
sup (S) = sup (S1 ) .
1 This notation is just about the most abominable thing imaginable. However, it saves space in the
presentation of this theory of positive matrices and avoids the use of new symbols. Please forget about it
when you leave this section.

POSITIVE MATRICES

Proof: Let λ ∈ S. Then there exists x >> 0 such that Ax > λx. Consider y ≡ x/ ||x||1 .
Then ||y||1 = 1 and Ay > λy. Therefore, λ ∈ S1 and so S ⊆ S1 . Therefore, sup (S) ≤
sup (S1 ) .
Now let λ ∈ S1 . Then there exists x ≥ 0 such that ||x||1 = 1 so x > 0 and Ax > λx.
Letting y ≡ Ax, it follows from Lemma A.0.2 that Ay >> λy and y >> 0. Thus λ ∈ S
and so S1 ⊆ S which shows that sup (S1 ) ≤ sup (S) . 
This lemma is signiﬁcant because the set, {x ≥ 0 such that ||x||1 = 1} ≡ K is a compact
set in Rn . Deﬁne
λ0 ≡ sup (S) = sup (S1 ) .
(1.1)
The following theorem is due to Perron.
Theorem A.0.4 Let A >> 0 be an n × n matrix and let λ0 be given in (1.1). Then
1. λ0 > 0 and there exists x0 >> 0 such that Ax0 = λ0 x0 so λ0 is an eigenvalue for A.
2. If Ax = µx where x ̸= 0, and µ ̸= λ0 . Then |µ| < λ0 .
3. The eigenspace for λ0 has dimension 1.
T

Proof: To see λ0 > 0, consider the vector, e ≡ (1, · · · , 1) . Then
∑
(Ae)i =
Aij > 0
j

and so λ0 is at least as large as
min
i

∑

Aij .

Let {λk } be an increasing sequence of numbers from S1 converging to λ0 . Letting xk be
the vector from K which occurs in the deﬁnition of S1 , these vectors are in a compact set.
Therefore, there exists a subsequence, still denoted by xk such that xk → x0 ∈ K and
λk → λ0 . Then passing to the limit,
Ax0 ≥ λ0 x0 , x0 > 0.
If Ax0 > λ0 x0 , then letting y ≡ Ax0 , it follows from Lemma A.0.2 that Ay >> λ0 y and
y >> 0. But this contradicts the deﬁnition of λ0 as the supremum of the elements of S
because since Ay >> λ0 y, it follows Ay >> (λ0 + ε) y for ε a small positive number.
Therefore, Ax0 = λ0 x0 . It remains to verify that x0 >> 0. But this follows immediately
from
∑
0<
Aij x0j = (Ax0 )i = λ0 x0i .
j

This proves 1.
Next suppose Ax = µx and x ̸= 0 and µ ̸= λ0 . Then |Ax| = |µ| |x| . But this implies
A |x| ≥ |µ| |x| . (See the above abominable deﬁnition of |x|.)
Case 1: |x| ̸= x and |x| ̸= −x.
In this case, A |x| > |Ax| = |µ| |x| and letting y = A |x| , it follows y >> 0 and
Ay >> |µ| y which shows Ay >> (|µ| + ε) y for suﬃciently small positive ε and veriﬁes
|µ| < λ0 .
Case 2: |x| = x or |x| = −x
In this case, the entries of x are all real and have the same sign. Therefore, A |x| =
|Ax| = |µ| |x| . Now let y ≡ |x| / ||x||1 . Then Ay = |µ| y and so |µ| ∈ S1 showing that

405
|µ| ≤ λ0 . But also, the fact the entries of x all have the same sign shows µ = |µ| and so
µ ∈ S1 . Since µ ̸= λ0 , it must be that µ = |µ| < λ0 . This proves 2.
It remains to verify 3. Suppose then that Ay = λ0 y and for all scalars α, αx0 ̸= y. Then
A Re y = λ0 Re y, A Im y = λ0 Im y.
If Re y = α1 x0 and Im y = α2 x0 for real numbers, αi ,then y = (α1 + iα2 ) x0 and it is
assumed this does not happen. Therefore, either
t Re y ̸= x0 for all t ∈ R
or
t Im y ̸= x0 for all t ∈ R.
Assume the ﬁrst holds. Then varying t ∈ R, there exists a value of t such that x0 +t Re y > 0
but it is not the case that x0 +t Re y >> 0. Then A (x0 + t Re y) >> 0 by Lemma A.0.2. But
this implies λ0 (x0 + t Re y) >> 0 which is a contradiction. Hence there exist real numbers,
α1 and α2 such that Re y = α1 x0 and Im y = α2 x0 showing that y = (α1 + iα2 ) x0 . This
proves 3.
It is possible to obtain a simple corollary to the above theorem.
Corollary A.0.5 If A > 0 and Am >> 0 for some m ∈ N, then all the conclusions of the
above theorem hold.
Proof: There exists µ0 > 0 such that Am y0 = µ0 y0 for y0 >> 0 by Theorem A.0.4 and
µ0 = sup {µ : Am x ≥ µx for some x ∈ K} .
Let λm
0 = µ0 . Then
(
)
(A − λ0 I) Am−1 + λ0 Am−2 + · · · + λm−1
I y0 = (Am − λm
0
0 I) y0 = 0
(
)
and so letting x0 ≡ Am−1 + λ0 Am−2 + · · · + λm−1
I y0 , it follows x0 >> 0 and Ax0 =
0
λ0 x0 .
Suppose now that Ax = µx for x ̸= 0 and µ ̸= λ0 . Suppose |µ| ≥ λ0 . Multiplying both
m
sides by A, it follows Am x = µm x and |µm | = |µ| ≥ λm
0 = µ0 and so from Theorem A.0.4,
m
m
m
since |µ | ≥ µ0 , and µ is an eigenvalue of A , it follows that µm = µ0 . But by Theorem
A.0.4 again, this implies x = cy0 for some scalar, c and hence Ay0 = µy0 . Since y0 >> 0,
it follows µ ≥ 0 and so µ = λ0 , a contradiction. Therefore, |µ| < λ0 .
Finally, if Ax = λ0 x, then Am x = λm
0 x and so x = cy0 for some scalar, c. Consequently,
( m−1
)
(
)
A
+ λ0 Am−2 + · · · + λm−1
I x = c Am−1 + λ0 Am−2 + · · · + λm−1
I y0

0
= cx0 .
Hence
x = cx0
mλm−1
0
which shows the dimension of the eigenspace for λ0 is one. 
The following corollary is an extremely interesting convergence result involving the powers of positive matrices.
Corollary A.0.6 Let A > 0 and Am >> 0 for some(m ∈
)mN. Then for λ0 given in (1.1),
A
there exists a rank one matrix P such that limm→∞

Proof: Considering AT , and the fact that A and AT have the same eigenvalues, Corollary
A.0.5 implies the existence of a vector, v >> 0 such that
AT v = λ0 v.
Also let x0 denote the vector such that Ax0 = λ0 x0 with x0 >> 0. First note that xT0 v > 0
because both these vectors have all entries positive. Therefore, v may be scaled such that
vT x0 = xT0 v = 1.

The eigenvalues of λA0 − P are of interest because it is powers of this matrix which

λ0
But since P x = 0, it follows from (1.6) that
Ax = λ0 µx
which implies λ0 µ is an eigenvalue of A. Therefore, by Corollary A.0.5 it follows that either
λ0 µ = λ0 in which case µ = 1, or λ0 |µ| < λ0 which implies |µ| < 1. But if µ = 1, then x is
a multiple of x0 and (1.6) would yield

which says x0 −x0 vT x0 = x0 and so by (1.2), x0 = 0 contrary to the property that x0 >> 0.
Therefore,
|µ| < 1 and so this has shown that the absolute values of all eigenvalues of

What about the case when A > 0 but maybe it is not the case that A >> 0? As before,
K ≡ {x ≥ 0 such that ||x||1 = 1} .
Now deﬁne
S1 ≡ {λ : Ax ≥ λx for some x ∈ K}
and
λ0 ≡ sup (S1 )

(1.7)

Theorem A.0.7 Let A > 0 and let λ0 be deﬁned in (1.7). Then there exists x0 > 0 such
that Ax0 = λ0 x0 .
Proof: Let E consist of the matrix which has a one in every entry. Then from Theorem
A.0.4 it follows there exists xδ >> 0 , ||xδ ||1 = 1, such that (A + δE) xδ = λ0δ xδ where
λ0δ ≡ sup {λ : (A + δE) x ≥ λx for some x ∈ K} .
Now if α < δ
{λ : (A + αE) x ≥ λx for some x ∈ K} ⊆
{λ : (A + δE) x ≥ λx for some x ∈ K}
and so λ0δ ≥ λ0α because λ0δ is the sup of the second set and λ0α is the sup of the ﬁrst. It
follows the limit, λ1 ≡ limδ→0+ λ0δ exists. Taking a subsequence and using the compactness
of K, there exists a subsequence, still denoted by δ such that as δ → 0, xδ → x ∈ K.
Therefore,
Ax = λ1 x
and so, in particular, Ax ≥ λ1 x and so λ1 ≤ λ0 . But also, if λ ≤ λ0 ,
λx ≤ Ax < (A + δE) x
showing that λ0δ ≥ λ for all such λ. But then λ0δ ≥ λ0 also. Hence λ1 ≥ λ0 , showing these
two numbers are the same. Hence Ax = λ0 x. 
If Am >> 0 for some m and A > 0, it follows that the dimension of the eigenspace for
λ0 is one and that the absolute value of every other eigenvalue of A is less than λ0 . If it is
only assumed that A > 0, not necessarily >> 0, this is no longer true. However, there is
something which is very interesting which can be said. First here is an interesting lemma.

C

where A is an r × r matrix and C is an (n − r) × (n − r) matrix. Then det (M ) =

Proof: To verify the claim about the determinants, note

The case where M is upper block triangular is similar.
This immediately implies σ (M ) = σ (A) ∪ σ (C) .
Theorem A.0.9 Let A > 0 and let λ0 be given in (1.7). If λ is an eigenvalue for A such
m
that |λ| = λ0 , then λ/λ0 is a root of unity. Thus (λ/λ0 ) = 1 for some m ∈ N.
Proof: Applying Theorem A.0.7 to AT , there exists v > 0 such that AT v = λ0 v. In
the ﬁrst part of the argument it is assumed v >> 0. Now suppose Ax = λx, x ̸= 0 and that
|λ| = λ0 . Then
A |x| ≥ |λ| |x| = λ0 |x|
and it follows that if A |x| > |λ| |x| , then since v >> 0,
(
)
λ0 (v, |x|) < (v,A |x|) = AT v, |x| = λ0 (v, |x|) ,
a contradiction. Therefore,
A |x| = λ0 |x| .

It follows that

must have the same argument for every k, j because equality holds in the triangle inequality.
Therefore, there exists a complex number, µi such that
Aij xj = µi Aij |xj |
and so, letting r ∈ N,

(1.9)

Aij xj µrj = µi Aij |xj | µrj .

Summing on j yields

Now recall that r ∈ N was arbitrary and so this has shown that λλ0 , λλ0 , λλ0 , · · ·
( )
are each eigenvalues of λA0 which has only ﬁnitely many and hence this sequence must
( )
repeat. Therefore, λλ0 is a root of unity as claimed. This proves the theorem in the case
that v >> 0.
Now it is necessary to consider the case where v > 0 but it is not the case that v >> 0.
Then in this case, there exists a permutation matrix P such that



 .. 

Then
λ0 v = AT v = AT P v1 .
Therefore,
λ0 v1 = P AT P v1 = Gv1
Now P 2 = I because it is a permutation matrix. Therefore, the matrix G ≡ P AT P and A
are similar. Consequently, they have the same eigenvalues and it suﬃces from now on to
consider the matrix G rather than A. Then

where M1 is r × r and M4 is (n − r) × (n − r) . It follows from block multiplication and the
assumption that A and hence G are > 0 that
( ′
)
A B
G=

0 C
Now let λ be an eigenvalue of G such that |λ| = λ0 . Then from Lemma A.0.8, either
λ ∈ σ (A′ ) or λ ∈ σ (C) . Suppose without loss of generality that λ ∈ σ (A′ ) . Since A′ > 0
it has a largest positive eigenvalue λ′0 which is obtained from (1.7). Thus λ′0 ≤ λ0 but λ
being an eigenvalue of A′ , has its absolute value bounded by λ′0 and so λ0 = |λ| ≤ λ′0 ≤ λ0
showing that λ0 ∈ σ (A′ ) . Now if there exists v >> 0 such that A′T v = λ0 v, then the ﬁrst
part of this proof applies to the matrix A and so (λ/λ0 ) is a root of unity. If such a vector,
v does not exist, then let A′ play the role of A in the above argument and reduce to the
consideration of
( ′′
)
A
B′
G′ ≡
0 C′
where G′ is similar to A′ and λ, λ0 ∈ σ (A′′ ) . Stop if A′′T v = λ0 v for some v >> 0.
Otherwise, decompose A′′ similar to the above and add another prime. Continuing this way
T
you must eventually obtain the situation where (A′···′ ) v = λ0 v for some v >> 0. Indeed,
′···′
this happens no later than when A
is a 1 × 1 matrix. 

Perhaps this isn’t the ﬁrst thing you would think of. Of course the ability to get this nice
closed form description of sin (A) was dependent on being able to ﬁnd the Jordan form along
with a similarity transformation which will yield the Jordan form.
The following corollary is known as the spectral mapping theorem.
Corollary B.0.12 Let A be an n × n matrix and let ρ (A) < R where for |λ| < R,
f (λ) =

∞
∑

an λn .

n=0

Then f (A) is also an n × n matrix and furthermore, σ (f (A)) = f (σ (A)) . Thus the eigenvalues of f (A) are exactly the numbers f (λ) where λ is an eigenvalue of A. Furthermore,
the algebraic multiplicity of f (λ) coincides with the algebraic multiplicity of λ.
All of these things can be generalized to linear transformations deﬁned on inﬁnite dimensional spaces and when this is done the main tool is the Dunford integral along with
the methods of complex analysis. It is good to see it done for ﬁnite dimensional situations
ﬁrst because it gives an idea of what is possible. Actually, some of the most interesting
functions in applications do not come in the above form as a power series expanded about
0. One example of this situation has already been encountered in the proof of the right
polar decomposition with the square root of an Hermitian transformation which had all
nonnegative eigenvalues. Another example is that of taking the positive part of an Hermitian matrix. This is important in some physical models where something may depend on
the positive part of the strain which is a symmetric real matrix. Obviously there is no way
to consider this as a power series expanded about 0 because the function f (r) = r+ is not
even diﬀerentiable at 0. Therefore, a totally diﬀerent approach must be considered. First
the notion of a positive part is deﬁned.
Deﬁnition B.0.13 Let A be an Hermitian matrix. Thus it suﬃces to consider A as an
element of L (Fn , Fn ) according to the usual notion of matrix multiplication. Then there
exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, {u1 , · · · , un } such that

This gives us a nice deﬁnition of what is meant but it turns out to be very important in
the applications to determine how this function depends on the choice of symmetric matrix
A. The following addresses this question.

A+ − B + ≤ |A − B| .

Applications To Diﬀerential
Equations
C.1

Theory Of Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations

Here I will present fundamental existence and uniqueness theorems for initial value problems
for the diﬀerential equation,
x′ = f (t, x) .
Suppose that f : [a, b] × Rn → Rn satisﬁes the following two conditions.
|f (t, x) − f (t, x1 )| ≤ K |x − x1 | ,

(3.1)

f is continuous.

(3.2)

The ﬁrst of these conditions is known as a Lipschitz condition.
Lemma C.1.1 Suppose x : [a, b] → Rn is a continuous function and c ∈ [a, b]. Then x is a
solution to the initial value problem,
x′ = f (t, x) , x (c) = x0
if and only if x is a solution to the integral equation,
∫ t
x (t) = x0 +
f (s, x (s)) ds.

(3.3)

(3.4)

c

Proof: If x solves (3.4), then since f is continuous, we may apply the fundamental
theorem of calculus to diﬀerentiate both sides and obtain x′ (t) = f (t, x (t)) . Also, letting
t = c on both sides, gives x (c) = x0 . Conversely, if x is a solution of the initial value
problem, we may integrate both sides from c to t to see that x solves (3.4). 
Theorem C.1.2 Let f satisfy (3.1) and (3.2). Then there exists a unique solution to the
initial value problem, (3.3) on the interval [a, b].
{
}
Proof: Let ||x||λ ≡ sup eλt |x (t)| : t ∈ [a, b] . Then this norm is equivalent to the usual
norm on BC ([a, b] , Fn ) described in Example 14.6.2. This means that for ||·|| the norm given
there, there exist constants δ and ∆ such that
||x||λ δ ≤ ||x|| ≤ ∆ ||x||

APPLICATIONS TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

for all x ∈BC ([a, b] , Fn ) . In fact, you can take δ ≡ eλa and ∆ ≡ eλb in case λ > 0 with the
two reversed in case λ < 0. Thus BC ([a, b] , Fn ) is a Banach space with this norm, ||·||λ .
Then let F : BC ([a, b] , Fn ) → BC ([a, b] , Fn ) be deﬁned by
∫ t
F x (t) ≡ x0 +
f (s, x (s)) ds.
c

Let λ < 0. It follows

and therefore,

If |λ| is chosen larger than K, this implies F is a contraction mapping on BC ([a, b] , Fn ) .
Therefore, there exists a unique ﬁxed point. With Lemma C.1.1 this proves the theorem. 

C.2

Linear Systems

As an example of the above theorem, consider for t ∈ [a, b] the system
x′ = A (t) x (t) + g (t) , x (c) = x0

(3.5)

where A (t) is an n × n matrix whose entries are continuous functions of t, (aij (t)) and
g (t) is a vector whose components are continuous functions of t satisﬁes the conditions
T
of Theorem C.1.2 with f (t, x) = A (t) x + g (t) . To see this, let x = (x1 , · · · , xn ) and
T
x1 = (x11 , · · · x1n ) . Then letting M = max {|aij (t)| : t ∈ [a, b] , i, j ≤ n} ,
|f (t, x) − f (t, x1 )| = |A (t) (x − x1 )|

Therefore, let K = M n. This proves
Theorem C.2.1 Let A (t) be a continuous n × n matrix and let g (t) be a continuous vector
for t ∈ [a, b] and let c ∈ [a, b] and x0 ∈ Fn . Then there exists a unique solution to (3.5)
valid for t ∈ [a, b] .
This includes more examples of linear equations than are typically encountered in an
entire diﬀerential equations course.

Lemma C.3.1 Let D (x0 , r) ≡ {x ∈ Fn : |x − x0 | ≤ r} and suppose U is an open set containing D (x0 , r) such that f : U → Fn is C 1 (U ) . (Recall this means all partial derivatives of
f exist and are continuous.) Then for K = M n, where M denotes the maximum of

Now consider the map, P which maps all of Rn to D (x0 , r) given as follows. For
x ∈ D (x0 , r) , P x = x. For x ∈D
/ (x0 , r) , P x will be the closest point in D (x0 , r) to x. Such
a closest point exists because D (x0 , r) is a closed and bounded set. Taking f (y) ≡ |y − x| ,
it follows f is a continuous function deﬁned on D (x0 , r) which must achieve its minimum

= |x−P x| + 2t Re ((x − P x) · (P x − z)) + t2 |z−P x|

2

Hence
2

2t Re ((x − P x) · (P x − z)) + t2 |z−P x| ≥ 0
and this can only happen if
Re ((x − P x) · (P x − z)) ≥ 0.
Therefore,
Re ((x − P x) · (P x−P y)) ≥ 0
Re ((y − P y) · (P y−P x)) ≥ 0
and so
Re (x − P x − (y − P y)) · (P x−P y) ≥ 0
which implies
Re (x − y) · (P x − P y) ≥ |P x − P y|

2

Then using the Cauchy Schwarz inequality it follows
|x − y| ≥ |P x − P y| .

With this here is the local existence and uniqueness theorem.
Theorem C.3.3 Let [a, b] be a closed interval and let U be an open subset of Fn . Let
∂f
f : [a, b] × U → Fn be continuous and suppose that for each t ∈ [a, b] , the map x → ∂x
(t, x)
i
is continuous. Also let x0 ∈ U and c ∈ [a, b] . Then there exists an interval, I ⊆ [a, b] such
that c ∈ I and there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem,
x′ = f (t, x) , x (c) = x0

(3.6)

valid for t ∈ I.
Proof: Consider the following picture.
U
x0
D(x0 , r)
The large dotted circle represents U and the little solid circle represents D (x0 , r) as
indicated. Here r is so small that D (x0 , r) is contained in U as shown. Now let P denote
the projection map deﬁned above. Consider the initial value problem
x′ = f (t, P x) , x (c) = x0 .

(3.7)

∂f
From Lemma C.3.1 and the continuity of x → ∂x
(t, x) , there exists a constant, K such
i
that if x, y ∈ D (x0 , r) , then |f (t, x) − f (t, y)| ≤ K |x − y| for all t ∈ [a, b] . Therefore, by
Lemma C.3.2
|f (t, P x) − f (t, P y)| ≤ K |P x−P y| ≤ K |x − y| .

It follows from Theorem C.1.2 that (3.7) has a unique solution valid for t ∈ [a, b] . Since
x is continuous, it follows that there exists an interval, I containing c such that for t ∈ I,

421

x (t) ∈ D (x0 , r) . Therefore, for these values of t, f (t, P x) = f (t, x) and so there is a unique
solution to (3.6) on I. 
Now suppose f has the property that for every R > 0 there exists a constant, KR such
that for all x, x1 ∈ B (0, R),
|f (t, x) − f (t, x1 )| ≤ KR |x − x1 | .

(3.8)

Corollary C.3.4 Let f satisfy (3.8) and suppose also that (t, x) → f (t, x) is continuous.
Suppose now that x0 is given and there exists an estimate of the form |x (t)| < R for all
t ∈ [0, T ) where T ≤ ∞ on the local solution to
x′ = f (t, x) , x (0) = x0 .

(3.9)

Then there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem, (3.9) valid on [0, T ).
Proof: Replace f (t, x) with f (t, P x) where P is the projection onto B (0, R). Then by
Theorem C.1.2 there exists a unique solution to the system
x′ = f (t, P x) , x (0) = x0
valid on [0, T1 ] for every T1 < T. Therefore, the above system has a unique solution on [0, T )
and from the estimate, P x = x. 

C.4

First Order Linear Systems

Here is a discussion of linear systems of the form
x′ = Ax + f (t)
where A is a constant n × n matrix and f is a vector valued function having all entries
continuous. Of course the existence theory is a very special case of the general considerations
above but I will give a self contained presentation based on elementary ﬁrst order scalar
diﬀerential equations and linear algebra.

Then if M ′ (t) and N ′ (t) both exist, it follows that

w (t) satisﬁes the following.
u (t) − Kw (t) = w′ (t) − Kw (t) ≤ u0 , w (0) = 0.

because this is equivalent to saying (x − y) ≥ 0.)

|(z,Az)| , |(Az, z)| ≤ nK |z| .

(3.15)

Now multiplying (3.14) by z and observing that
d ( 2)
|z| = (z′ , z) + (z, z′ ) = (Az, z) + (z,Az) ,

it follows from (3.15) and the observation that z (0) = 0,
∫ t

|z (t)| ≤

and so by Gronwall’s inequality, |z (t)| = 0 for all t ≥ 0. Thus,
x (t) = y (t)
for all t ≥ a.
Now let w (t) = x (a − t) − y (a − t) for t ≥ 0. Then w′ (t) = (−A) w (t) and you can
repeat the argument which was just given to conclude that x (t) = y (t) for all t ≤ a. 
Deﬁnition C.4.5 Let A be an n × n matrix. We say Φ (t) is a fundamental matrix for A
if
Φ′ (t) = AΦ (t) , Φ (0) = I,
(3.16)
−1

and Φ (t)

exists for all t ∈ R.

Why should anyone care about a fundamental matrix? The reason is that such a matrix
valued function makes possible a convenient description of the solution of the initial value
problem,
x′ = Ax + f (t) , x (0) = x0 ,
(3.17)
on the interval, [0, T ] . First consider the special case where n = 1. This is the ﬁrst order
linear diﬀerential equation,
r′ = λr + g, r (0) = r0 ,
(3.18)
where g is a continuous scalar valued function. First consider the case where g = 0.
Lemma C.4.6 There exists a unique solution to the initial value problem,
r′ = λr, r (0) = 1,

(3.19)

and the solution for λ = a + ib is given by
r (t) = eat (cos bt + i sin bt) .

(3.20)

This solution to the initial value problem is denoted as eλt . (If λ is real, eλt as deﬁned here
reduces to the usual exponential function so there is no contradiction between this and earlier
notation seen in Calculus.)

APPLICATIONS TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Proof: From the uniqueness theorem presented above, Theorem C.4.4, applied to the
case where n = 1, there can be no more than one solution to the initial value problem,
(3.19). Therefore, it only remains to verify (3.20) is a solution to (3.19). However, this is
an easy calculus exercise. 
Note the diﬀerential equation in (3.19) says
d ( λt )
e
= λeλt .
dt

(3.21)

With this lemma, it becomes possible to easily solve the case in which g ̸= 0.
Theorem C.4.7 There exists a unique solution to (3.18) and this solution is given by the
formula,
∫ t
r (t) = eλt r0 + eλt
e−λs g (s) ds.
(3.22)
0

Proof: By the uniqueness theorem, Theorem C.4.4, there is no more∫ than one solution.
0
It only remains to verify that (3.22) is a solution. But r (0) = eλ0 r0 + 0 e−λs g (s) ds = r0
and so the initial condition is satisﬁed. Next diﬀerentiate this expression to verify the
diﬀerential equation is also satisﬁed. Using (3.21), the product rule and the fundamental
theorem of calculus,
∫ t
r′ (t) = λeλt r0 + λeλt
e−λs g (s) ds + eλt e−λt g (t) = λr (t) + g (t) . 

Now consider the question of ﬁnding a fundamental matrix for A. When this is done, it
will be easy to give a formula for the general solution to (3.17) known as the variation of
constants formula, arguably the most important result in diﬀerential equations.
The next theorem gives a formula for the fundamental matrix (3.16). It is known as
Putzer’s method [1],[21].

It remains to verify that if (3.23) holds, then Φ (t) exists for all t. To do so, consider
v ̸= 0 and suppose for some t0 , Φ (t0 ) v = 0. Let x (t) ≡ Φ (t0 + t) v. Then
x′ (t) = AΦ (t0 + t) v = Ax (t) , x (0) = Φ (t0 ) v = 0.
But also z (t) ≡ 0 also satisﬁes
z′ (t) = Az (t) , z (0) = 0,
and so by the theorem on uniqueness, it must be the case that z (t) = x (t) for all t, showing
that Φ (t + t0 ) v = 0 for all t, and in particular for t = −t0 . Therefore,
Φ (−t0 + t0 ) v = Iv = 0
and so v = 0, a contradiction. It follows that Φ (t) must be one to one for all t and so,
−1
Φ (t) exists for all t.
It only remains to verify the solution to (3.23) is unique. Suppose Ψ is another fundamental matrix solving (3.23). Then letting v be an arbitrary vector,
z (t) ≡ Φ (t) v, y (t) ≡ Ψ (t) v
both solve the initial value problem,
x′ = Ax, x (0) = v,

APPLICATIONS TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

and so by the uniqueness theorem, z (t) = y (t) for all t showing that Φ (t) v = Ψ (t) v for
all t. Since v is arbitrary, this shows that Φ (t) = Ψ (t) for every t. 
It is useful to consider the diﬀerential equations for the rk for k ≥ 1. As noted above,
r0 (t) = 0 and r1 (t) = eλ1 t .

rk+1

Thus

assuming λ1 ̸= λ2 .
Sometimes people deﬁne a fundamental matrix to be a matrix Φ (t) such that Φ′ (t) =
AΦ (t) and det (Φ (t)) ̸= 0 for all t. Thus this avoids the initial condition, Φ (0) = I. The
next proposition has to do with this situation.
Proposition C.4.9 Suppose A is an n × n matrix and suppose Φ (t) is an n × n matrix for
each t ∈ R with the property that
Φ′ (t) = AΦ (t) .
(3.25)
Then either Φ (t)

−1

−1

exists for all t ∈ R or Φ (t)

fails to exist for all t ∈ R.

−1

Proof: Suppose Φ (0) exists and (3.25) holds. Let Ψ (t) ≡ Φ (t) Φ (0)
I and
−1
−1
Ψ′ (t) = Φ′ (t) Φ (0) = AΦ (t) Φ (0) = AΨ (t)
−1

−1

. Then Ψ (0) =

−1

so by Theorem C.4.8, Ψ (t) exists for all t. Therefore, Φ (t) also exists for all t.
−1
−1
Next suppose Φ (0) does not exist. I need to show Φ (t) does not exist for any t.
−1
−1
Suppose then that Φ (t0 ) does exist. Then letΨ (t) ≡ Φ (t0 + t) Φ (t0 ) . Then Ψ (0) =
−1
I and Ψ′ = AΨ so by Theorem C.4.8 it follows Ψ (t)
exists for all t and so for all
−1
−1
t, Φ (t + t0 ) must also exist, even for t = −t0 which implies Φ (0) exists after all. 
The conclusion of this proposition is usually referred to as the Wronskian alternative and
another way to say it is that if (3.25) holds, then either det (Φ (t)) = 0 for all t or det (Φ (t))
is never equal to 0. The Wronskian is the usual name of the function, t → det (Φ (t)).
The following theorem gives the variation of constants formula,.
Theorem C.4.10 Let f be continuous on [0, T ] and let A be an n × n matrix and x0 a
vector in Cn . Then there exists a unique solution to (3.17), x, given by the variation of

for Φ (t) the fundamental matrix for A. Also, Φ (t) = Φ (−t) and Φ (t + s) = Φ (t) Φ (s)

x (t) = Φ (t) x0 +

Proof: From the uniqueness theorem there is at most one solution to (3.17). Therefore,
if (3.26) solves (3.17), the theorem is proved. The veriﬁcation that the given formula works
is identical with the veriﬁcation that the scalar formula given in Theorem C.4.7 solves the
−1
initial value problem given there. Φ (s) is continuous because of the formula for the inverse
of a matrix in terms of the transpose of the cofactor matrix. Therefore, the integrand in
(3.26) is continuous and the fundamental theorem of calculus applies. To verify the formula
for the inverse, ﬁx s and consider x (t) = Φ (s + t) v, and y (t) = Φ (t) Φ (s) v. Then
x′ (t) = AΦ (t + s) v = Ax (t) , x (0) = Φ (s) v
y′ (t) = AΦ (t) Φ (s) v = Ay (t) , y (0) = Φ (s) v.
By the uniqueness theorem, x (t) = y (t) for all t. Since s and v are arbitrary, this shows
−1
Φ (t + s) = Φ (t) Φ (s) for all t, s. Letting s = −t and using Φ (0) = I veriﬁes Φ (t)
=
Φ (−t) .
−1
Next, note that this also implies Φ (t − s) Φ (s) = Φ (t) and so Φ (t − s) = Φ (t) Φ (s) .
Therefore, this yields (3.27) and then (3.28)follows from changing the variable. 
−1
If Φ′ = AΦ and Φ (t) exists for all t, you should verify that the solution to the initial
value problem
x′ = Ax + f , x (t0 ) = x0
is given by

∫

x (t) = Φ (t − t0 ) x0 +

Theorem C.4.10 is general enough to include all constant coeﬃcient linear diﬀerential
equations or any order. Thus it includes as a special case the main topics of an entire
elementary diﬀerential equations class. This is illustrated in the following example. One
can reduce an arbitrary linear diﬀerential equation to a ﬁrst order system and then apply the
above theory to solve the problem. The next example is a diﬀerential equation of damped
vibration.
Example C.4.11 The diﬀerential equation is y ′′ + 2y ′ + 2y = cos t and initial conditions,
y (0) = 1 and y ′ (0) = 0.
To solve this equation, let x1 = y and x2 = x′1 = y ′ . Then, writing this in terms of these
new variables, yields the following system.
x′2 + 2x2 + 2x1 = cos t
x′1 = x2
This system can be written in the above form as

Geometric Theory Of Autonomous Systems

Here a suﬃcient condition is given for stability of a ﬁrst order system. First of all, here is
a fundamental estimate for the entries of a fundamental matrix.
Lemma C.5.1 Let the functions, rk be given in the statement of Theorem C.4.8 and suppose that A is an n × n matrix whose eigenvalues are {λ1 , · · · , λn } . Suppose that these
eigenvalues are ordered such that
Re (λ1 ) ≤ Re (λ2 ) ≤ · · · ≤ Re (λn ) < 0.
Then if 0 > −δ > Re (λn ) is given, there exists a constant, C such that for each k =
0, 1, · · · , n,
|rk (t)| ≤ Ce−δt
(3.29)
for all t > 0.
Proof: This is obvious for r0 (t) because it is identically equal to 0. From the deﬁnition
of the rk , r1′ = λ1 r1 , r1 (0) = 1 and so r1 (t) = eλ1 t which implies
|r1 (t)| ≤ eRe(λ1 )t .

It follows by induction there exists a constant, C such that for all k ≤ n,
|rk (t)| ≤ Ctn eRe(λn )t
and this obviously implies the conclusion of the lemma.
The proof of the above lemma yields the following corollary.
Corollary C.5.2 Let the functions, rk be given in the statement of Theorem C.4.8 and
suppose that A is an n × n matrix whose eigenvalues are {λ1 , · · · , λn } . Suppose that these
eigenvalues are ordered such that
Re (λ1 ) ≤ Re (λ2 ) ≤ · · · ≤ Re (λn ) .
Then there exists a constant C such that for all k ≤ m
|rk (t)| ≤ Ctm eRe(λm )t .
With the lemma, the following sloppy estimate is available for a fundamental matrix.
Theorem C.5.3 Let A be an n × n matrix and let Φ (t) be the fundamental matrix for A.
That is,
Φ′ (t) = AΦ (t) , Φ (0) = I.
Suppose also the eigenvalues of A are {λ1 , · · · , λn } where these eigenvalues are ordered such
that
Re (λ1 ) ≤ Re (λ2 ) ≤ · · · ≤ Re (λn ) < 0.
Then if 0 > −δ > Re (λn ) , is given, there exists a constant, C such that Φ (t)ij ≤ Ce−δt
for all t > 0. Also
|Φ (t) x| ≤ Cn3/2 e−δt |x| .

This proves (3.30) and completes the proof.
Deﬁnition C.5.4 Let f : U → Rn where U is an open subset of Rn such that a ∈ U and
f (a) = 0. A point, a where f (a) = 0 is called an equilibrium point. Then a is asymptotically
stable if for any ε > 0 there exists r > 0 such that whenever |x0 − a| < r and x (t) the
solution to the initial value problem,
x′ = f (x) , x (0) = x0 ,
it follows
lim x (t) = a, |x (t) − a| < ε

t→∞

A diﬀerential equation of the form x′ = f (x) is called autonomous as opposed to a nonautonomous equation of the form x′ = f (t, x) . The equilibrium point a is stable if for every
ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if |x0 − a| < δ, then if x is the solution of
x′ = f (x) , x (0) = x0 ,

(3.31)

then |x (t) − a| < ε for all t > 0.
Obviously asymptotic stability implies stability.
An ordinary diﬀerential equation is called almost linear if it is of the form
x′ = Ax + g (x)
where A is an n × n matrix and
lim

x→0

g (x)
= 0.
|x|

Now the stability of an equilibrium point of an autonomous system, x′ = f (x) can
always be reduced to the consideration of the stability of 0 for an almost linear system.
Here is why. If you are considering the equilibrium point, a for x′ = f (x) , you could
deﬁne a new variable, y by a + y = x. Then asymptotic stability would involve |y (t)| < ε
and limt→∞ y (t) = 0 while stability would only require |y (t)| < ε. Then since a is an
equilibrium point, y solves the following initial value problem.
y′ = f (a + y) − f (a) , y (0) = y0 ,

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/

C.5. GEOMETRIC THEORY OF AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS

431

where y0 = x0 − a.
Let A = Df (a) . Then from the deﬁnition of the derivative of a function,
y′ = Ay + g (y) , y (0) = y0
where
lim

y→0

(3.32)

g (y)
= 0.
|y|

Thus there is never any loss of generality in considering only the equilibrium point 0 for an
almost linear system.1 Therefore, from now on I will only consider the case of almost linear
systems and the equilibrium point 0.
Theorem C.5.5 Consider the almost linear system of equations,
x′ = Ax + g (x)
where
lim

x→0

(3.33)

g (x)
=0
|x|

and g is a C 1 function. Suppose that for all λ an eigenvalue of A, Re λ < 0. Then 0 is
asymptotically stable.
Proof: By Theorem C.5.3 there exist constants δ > 0 and K such that for Φ (t) the
fundamental matrix for A,
|Φ (t) x| ≤ Ke−δt |x| .
Let ε > 0 be given and let r be small enough that Kr < ε and for |x| < (K + 1) r, |g (x)| <
η |x| where η is so small that Kη < δ, and let |y0 | < r. Then by the variation of constants
formula, the solution to (3.33), at least for small t satisﬁes
∫

t

Φ (t − s) g (y (s)) ds.

y (t) = Φ (t) y0 +

The following estimate holds.
∫ t

Therefore,

e |y (t)| < Kr +

By Gronwall’s inequality,
eδt |y (t)| < KreKηt
and so
|y (t)| < Kre(Kη−δ)t < εe(Kη−δ)t
Therefore, |y (t)| < Kr < ε for all t and so from Corollary C.3.4, the solution to (3.33)
exists for all t ≥ 0 and since Kη − δ < 0,
lim |y (t)| = 0.

APPLICATIONS TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

General Geometric Theory

Here I will consider the case where the matrix A has both positive and negative eigenvalues.
First here is a useful lemma.
Lemma C.6.1 Suppose A is an n × n matrix and there exists δ > 0 such that
0 < δ < Re (λ1 ) ≤ · · · ≤ Re (λn )
where {λ1 , · · · , λn } are the eigenvalues of A, with possibly some repeated. Then there exists
a constant, C such that for all t < 0,
|Φ (t) x| ≤ Ceδt |x|
Proof: I want an estimate on the solutions to the system
Φ′ (t) = AΦ (t) , Φ (0) = I.
for t < 0. Let s = −t and let Ψ (s) = Φ (t) . Then writing this in terms of Ψ,
Ψ′ (s) = −AΨ (s) , Ψ (0) = I.
Now the eigenvalues of −A have real parts less than −δ because these eigenvalues are
obtained from the eigenvalues of A by multiplying by −1. Then by Theorem C.5.3 there
exists a constant, C such that for any x,
|Ψ (s) x| ≤ Ce−δs |x| .
Therefore, from the deﬁnition of Ψ,
|Φ (t) x| ≤ Ceδt |x| .
Here is another essential lemma which is found in Coddington and Levinson [6]
Lemma C.6.2 Let pj (t) be polynomials with complex coeﬃcients and let
f (t) =

m
∑

pj (t) eλj t

j=1

where m ≥ 1, λj ̸= λk for j ̸= k, and none of the pj (t) vanish identically. Let
σ = max (Re (λ1 ) , · · · , Re (λm )) .
Then there exists a positive number, r and arbitrarily large positive values of t such that
e−σt |f (t)| > r.
In particular, |f (t)| is unbounded.
Proof: Suppose the largest exponent of any of the pj is M and let λj = aj + ibj . First
assume each aj = 0. This is convenient because σ = 0 in this case and the largest of the
Re (λj ) occurs in every λj .
Then arranging the above sum as a sum of decreasing powers of t,
f (t) = tM fM (t) + · · · + tf1 (t) + f0 (t) .

e−σt f (t) =
pj (t) ebj t + g (t)
j:aj =σ

∑
where limt→∞ g (t) = 0, g (t) being of the form s ps (t) e(as −σ+ibs )t where as − σ < 0. Then
this reduces to the case above in which σ = 0. Therefore, there exists r > 0 such that
e−σt f (t) > r
for arbitrarily large values of t. 
Next here is a Banach space which will be useful.
Lemma C.6.3 For γ > 0, let
{
}
Eγ = x ∈ BC ([0, ∞), Fn ) : t → eγt x (t) is also in BC ([0, ∞), Fn )
and let the norm be given by
||x||γ ≡ sup

{

eγt x (t) : t ∈ [0, ∞)

}

Then Eγ is a Banach space.
Proof: Let {xk } be a Cauchy sequence in Eγ . Then since BC ([0, ∞), Fn ) is a Banach
space, there exists y ∈ BC ([0, ∞), Fn ) such that eγt xk (t) converges uniformly on [0, ∞) to
y (t). Therefore e−γt eγt xk (t) = xk (t) converges uniformly to e−γt y (t) on [0, ∞). Deﬁne
x (t) ≡ e−γt y (t) . Then y (t) = eγt x (t) and by deﬁnition,
||xk − x||γ → 0.

where A− and A+ are square matrices of size k × k and (n − k) × (n − k) respectively. Also
assume A− has eigenvalues whose real parts are all less than −α while A+ has eigenvalues
whose real parts are all larger than α. Assume also that each of A− and A+ is upper
triangular.
Also, I will use the following convention. For v ∈ Fn ,

where v− consists of the ﬁrst k entries of v.
Then from Theorem C.5.3 and Lemma C.6.1 the following lemma is obtained.
Lemma C.7.1 Let A be of the form given in (3.34) as explained above and let Φ+ (t) and
Φ− (t) be the fundamental matrices corresponding to A+ and A− respectively. Then there
exist positive constants, α and γ such that
|Φ+ (t) y| ≤ Ceαt for all t < 0

(3.35)

|Φ− (t) y| ≤ Ce−(α+γ)t for all t > 0.

(3.36)

Also for any nonzero x ∈ Cn−k ,
|Φ+ (t) x| is unbounded.

(3.37)

Proof: The ﬁrst two claims have been established already. It suﬃces to pick α and γ
such that − (α + γ) is larger than all eigenvalues of A− and α is smaller than all eigenvalues
of A+ . It remains to verify (3.37). From the Putzer formula for Φ+ (t) ,
Φ+ (t) x =

n−1
∑

rk+1 (t) Pk (A) x

k=0

where P0 (A) ≡ I. Now each rk is a polynomial (possibly a constant) times an exponential.
This follows easily from the deﬁnition of the rk as solutions of the diﬀerential equations
′
rk+1
= λk+1 rk+1 + rk .

Now by assumption the eigenvalues have positive real parts so
σ ≡ max (Re (λ1 ) , · · · , Re (λn−k )) > 0.
It can also be assumed
Re (λ1 ) ≥ · · · ≥ Re (λn−k )
By Lemma C.6.2 it follows |Φ+ (t) x| is unbounded. This follows because
Φ+ (t) x = r1 (t) x +

∑

rk+1 (t) yk , r1 (t) = eλ1 t .

Since x ̸= 0, it has a nonzero entry, say xm ̸= 0. Consider the mth entry of the vector
Φ+ (t) x. By this Lemma the mth entry is unbounded and this is all it takes for x (t) to be
unbounded. 

APPLICATIONS TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Theorem C.7.3 Consider the initial value problem for the almost linear system
x′ = Ax + g (x) , x (0) = x0
in which g is C 1 and where at there are k < n eigenvalues of A which have negative real
parts and n − k eigenvalues of A which have positive real parts. Then 0 is not stable. More
precisely, there exists a set of points (a, ψ (a)) for a small and in a k dimensional subspace
such that for x0 on this set,
lim x (t, x0 ) = 0
t→∞

and for x0 not on this set, there exists a δ > 0 such that |x (t, x0 )| cannot remain less than
δ for all positive t.
Proof: This involves nothing more than a reduction to the situation of Lemma C.7.2.
From Theorem 10.5.2 on
( Page 10.5.2

It follows all conclusions of Lemma C.7.2 are valid for this theorem. 
The set of points (a, ψ (a)) for a small is called the stable manifold. Much more can be
said about the stable manifold and you should look at a good diﬀerential equations book

D.0.1

The Nested Interval Lemma

First, here is the one dimensional nested interval lemma.
Lemma D.0.4 Let Ik = [ak , bk ] be closed intervals, ak ≤ bk , such that Ik ⊇ Ik+1 for all k.
Then there exists a point c which is contained in all these intervals. If limk→∞ (bk − ak ) = 0,
then there is exactly one such point.
Proof: Note that the {ak } are an increasing sequence and that {bk } is a decreasing
sequence. Now note that if m < n, then
am ≤ an ≤ bn
while if m > n,
bn ≥ bm ≥ am .
It follows that am ≤ bn for any pair m, n. Therefore, each bn is an upper bound for all the
am and so if c ≡ sup {ak }, then for each n, it follows that c ≤ bn and so for all, an ≤ c ≤ bn
which shows that c is in all of these intervals.
If the condition on the lengths of the intervals holds, then if c, c′ are in all the intervals,
then if they are not equal, then eventually, for large enough k, they cannot both be contained
in [ak , bk ] since eventually bk − ak < |c − c′ |. This would be a contradiction. Hence c = c′ .

Deﬁnition D.0.5 The diameter of a set S, is deﬁned as
diam (S) ≡ sup {|x − y| : x, y ∈ S} .
Thus diam (S) is just a careful description of what you would think of as the diameter.
It measures how stretched out the set is.
Here is a multidimensional version of the nested interval lemma.

Lemma D.0.6 Let Ik = i=1 aki , bki ≡ x ∈ Rp : xi ∈ aki , bki
and suppose that for all

Then there exists a point c ∈ Rp which is an element of every Ik . If limk→∞ diam (Ik ) = 0,
then the point c is unique.
[ k k]

Proof: For each

[ ki =k ]1, · · · , p, ai , bi ⊇ ai , bi

If the condition on the diameters holds, then the lengths of the intervals limk→∞ aki , bki = 0
and so by the same lemma, each ci is unique. Hence c is unique. 

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

Convergent Sequences, Sequential Compactness

A mapping f : {k, k + 1, k + 2, · · · } → Rp is called a sequence. We usually write it in the
form {aj } where it is understood that aj ≡ f (j).
Deﬁnition D.0.7 A sequence, {ak } is said to converge to a if for every ε > 0 there exists
nε such that if n > nε , then |a − an | < ε. The usual notation for this is limn→∞ an = a
although it is often written as an → a. A closed set K ⊆ Rn is one which has the property
∞
that if {kj }j=1 is a sequence of points of K which converges to x, then x ∈ K.
One can also deﬁne a subsequence.
Deﬁnition D.0.8 {ank } is a subsequence of {an } if n1 < n2 < · · · .
The following theorem says the limit, if it exists, is unique.
Theorem D.0.9 If a sequence, {an } converges to a and to b then a = b.
Proof: There exists nε such that if n > nε then |an − a| <
|an − b| < 2ε . Then pick such an n.
|a − b| < |a − an | + |an − b| <

ε
2

and if n > nε , then

ε ε
+ = ε.
2 2

Since ε is arbitrary, this proves the theorem. 
The following is the deﬁnition of a Cauchy sequence in Rp .
Deﬁnition D.0.10 {an } is a Cauchy sequence if for all ε > 0, there exists nε such that
whenever n, m ≥ nε , if follows that |an −am | < ε.
A sequence is Cauchy, means the terms are “bunching up to each other” as m, n get
large.
Theorem D.0.11 The set of terms in a Cauchy sequence in Rp is bounded in the sense
that for all n, |an | < M for some M < ∞.
Proof: Let ε = 1 in the deﬁnition of a Cauchy sequence and let n > n1 . Then from the
deﬁnition, |an − an1 | < 1.It follows that for all n > n1 , |an | < 1 + |an1 | .Therefore, for all n,
|an | ≤ 1 + |an1 | +

n1
∑

|ak | . 

k=1

Theorem D.0.12 If a sequence {an } in Rp converges, then the sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Also, if some subsequence of a Cauchy sequence converges, then the original sequence
converges.
Proof: Let ε > 0 be given and suppose an → a. Then from the deﬁnition of convergence,
there exists nε such that if n > nε , it follows that |an −a| < 2ε . Therefore, if m, n ≥ nε + 1,
it follows that
ε ε
|an −am | ≤ |an −a| + |a − am | < + = ε
2 2
showing that, since ε > 0 is arbitrary, {an } is a Cauchy sequence. It remains to that the
last claim.
∞
Suppose then that {an } is a Cauchy sequence and a = limk→∞ ank where {ank }k=1
is a subsequence. Let ε > 0 be given. Then there exists K such that if k, l ≥ K, then

|ak − al | < 2ε . Then if k > K, it follows nk > K because n1 , n2 , n3 , · · · is strictly increasing
as the subscript increases. Also, there exists K1 such that if k > K1 , |ank − a| < 2ε . Then
letting n > max (K, K1 ), pick k > max (K, K1 ). Then
|a − an | ≤ |a − ank | + |ank − an | <

ε ε
+ = ε.

Therefore, the sequence converges. 

Denote by {J1 , · · · , J2p } these sets determined above. Since the union of these sets equals
all of I0 ≡ I, it follows that for some Jk , the sequence, {ai } is contained in Jk for inﬁnitely
many k. Let that one be called I1 . Next do for I1 what was done for I0 to get I2 ⊆ I1
such that the diameter is half that of I1 and I2 contains {ak } for inﬁnitely many values
of k. Continue in this way obtaining a nested sequence {Ik } such that Ik ⊇ Ik+1 , and if
x, y ∈ Ik , then |x − y| ≤ 2−k diam (I0 ), and In contains {ak } for inﬁnitely many values of
k for each n. Then by the nested interval lemma, there exists c such that c is contained in
each Ik . Pick an1 ∈ I1 . Next pick n2 > n1 such that an2 ∈ I2 . If an1 , · · · , ank have been
chosen, let ank+1 ∈ Ik+1 and nk+1 > nk . This can be done because in the construction, In
contains {ak } for inﬁnitely many k. Thus the distance between ank and c is no larger than
2−k diam (I0 ), and so limk→∞ ank = c ∈ I0 . 
Corollary D.0.15 Let K be a closed and bounded set of points in Rp . Then K is sequentially compact.
∏p
Proof: Since K is closed and bounded, there exists a closed rectangle, k=1 [ak , bk ]
which contains K. Now let {xk } be a sequence of ∏
points in K. By Theorem D.0.14, there
p
exists a subsequence {xnk } such that xnk → x ∈ k=1 [ak , bk ]. However, K is closed and
each xnk is in K so x ∈ K. 
Theorem D.0.16 Every Cauchy sequence in Rp converges.
∏p
Proof: Let {ak } be a Cauchy sequence. By Theorem D.0.11, there is some box i=1 [ai , bi ]
containing all∏the terms of {ak }. Therefore, by Theorem D.0.14, a subsequence converges
p
to a point of i=1 [ai , bi ]. By Theorem D.0.12, the original sequence converges. 

The Fundamental Theorem Of
Algebra
The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non constant polynomial having
coeﬃcients in C has a zero in C. If C is replaced by R, this is not true because of the
example, x2 + 1 = 0. This theorem is a very remarkable result and notwithstanding its title,
all the best proofs of it depend on either analysis or topology. It was proved by Gauss in
1797 then proved with no loose ends by Argand in 1806 although others also worked on
it. The proof given here follows Rudin [22]. See also Hardy [12] for another proof, more
discussion and references. Recall De Moivre’s theorem on Page 17 which is listed below for
convenience.
Theorem E.0.17 Let r > 0 be given. Then if n is a positive integer,
n

[r (cos t + i sin t)] = rn (cos nt + i sin nt) .
Now from this theorem, the following corollary on Page 1.5.5 is obtained.
Corollary E.0.18 Let z be a non zero complex number and let k be a positive integer. Then
there are always exactly k k th roots of z in C.

Lemma E.0.19 Let ak ∈ C for k = 1, · · · , n and let p (z) ≡ k=1 ak z k . Then p is continuous.

Then for |z − w| < 1, the triangle inequality implies |w| < 1 + |z| and so if |z − w| < 1,

|az n − awn | ≤ |a| |z − w| n (1 + |z|) .

Now let
λ ≡ inf {|p (z)| : z ∈ C} .
By (5.1), there exists an R > 0 such that if |z| > R, it follows that |p (z)| > λ + 1. Therefore,
λ ≡ inf {|p (z)| : z ∈ C} = inf {|p (z)| : |z| ≤ R} .
The set {z : |z| ≤ R} is a closed and bounded set and so this inﬁmum is achieved at some
point w with |w| ≤ R. A contradiction is obtained if |p (w)| = 0 so assume |p (w)| > 0. Then
consider

q (z) ≡

p (w)
It follows q (z) is of the form
q (z) = 1 + ck z k + · · · + cn z n
where ck ̸= 0, because q (0) = 1. It is also true that |q (z)| ≥ 1 by the assumption that
|p (w)| is the smallest value of |p (z)| . Now let θ ∈ C be a complex number with |θ| = 1 and
k

θck wk = − |w| |ck | .
If

|g (t, w)| < |w| |ck | /2
and so for such t,

|q (tηw)| < 1 − tk |w| |ck | + tk |w| |ck | /2 < 1,

The Symmetric Polynomial Theorem

First here is a deﬁnition of polynomials in many variables which have coeﬃcients in a
commutative ring. A commutative ring would be a ﬁeld except you don’t know that every
nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. If you like, let these coeﬃcients be in a ﬁeld
it is still interesting. A good example of a commutative ring is the integers. In particular,
every ﬁeld is a commutative ring.
Deﬁnition F.1.1 Let k ≡ (k1 , k2 , · · · , kn ) where each ki is a nonnegative integer. Let
∑
ki
|k| ≡

Polynomials of degree p in the variables x1 , x2 , · · · , xn are expressions of the form
∑
g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) =

|k|≤p

where each ak is in a commutative ring. If all ak = 0, the polynomial has no degree. Such
a polynomial is said to be symmetric if whenever σ is a permutation of {1, 2, · · · , n},
(
)
g xσ(1) , xσ(2) , · · · , xσ(n) = g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )
An example of a symmetric polynomial is

Another one is

is the coeﬃcient of (−1) xn−k in the following polynomial.

Then the following result is the fundamental theorem in the subject. It is the symmetric
polynomial theorem. It says that these elementary symmetric polynomials are a lot like a
basis for the symmetric polynomials.
Theorem F.1.3 Let g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) be a symmetric polynomial. Then g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )
equals a polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions.
∑
g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) =
ak sk11 · · · sknn
k

and the ak are unique.
Proof: If n = 1, it is obviously true because s1 = x1 . Suppose the theorem is true for
n − 1 and g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) has degree d. Let
g ′ (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn−1 ) ≡ g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn−1 , 0)
By induction, there are unique ak such that
g ′ (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn−1 ) =

∑

′k

n−1
1
ak s′k
1 · · · sn−1

k

where s′i is the corresponding symmetric polynomial which pertains to x1 , x2 , · · · , xn−1 .
Note that
sk (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn−1 , 0) = s′k (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn−1 )
Now consider
g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) −

∑

k

n−1
≡ q (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )
ak sk11 · · · sn−1

k

is a symmetric polynomial and it equals 0 when xn equals 0. Since it is symmetric, it is also
0 whenever xi = 0. Therefore,
q (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) = sn h (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )
and it follows that h (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) is symmetric of degree no more than d − n and is
uniquely determined. Thus, if g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) is symmetric of degree d,
∑
kn−1
g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) =
ak sk11 · · · sn−1
+ sn h (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )
k

where h has degree no more than d − n. Now apply the same argument to h (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )
and continue, repeatedly obtaining a sequence of symmetric polynomials hi , of strictly decreasing degree, obtaining expressions of the form
∑
kn−1 kn
g (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) =
bk sk11 · · · sn−1
sn + sn hm (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )
k

Eventually hm must be a constant or zero. By induction, each step in the argument yields
uniqueness and so, the ﬁnal sum of combinations of elementary symmetric functions is
uniquely determined. 
Here is a very interesting result which I saw claimed in a paper by Steinberg and Redheﬀer
on Lindemannn’s theorem which follows from the above corollary.

Theorem F.1.4 Let α1 , · · · , αn be roots of the polynomial equation
an xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0 = 0
where each ai is an integer. Then any symmetric polynomial in the quantities an α1 , · · · , an αn
having integer coeﬃcients is also an integer. Also any symmetric polynomial in the quantities α1 , · · · , αn having rational coeﬃcients is a rational number.
Proof: Let f (x1 , · · · , xn ) be the symmetric polynomial. Thus
f (x1 , · · · , xn ) ∈ Z [x1 · · · xn ]
From Corollary F.1.3 it follows there are integers ak1 ···kn such that
∑
f (x1 , · · · , xn ) =
ak1 ···kn pk11 · · · pknn
k1 +···+kn ≤m

where the pi are the elementary symmetric polynomials deﬁned as the coeﬃcients of

Thus

∑
=
ak1 ···kn pk11 (an α1 , · · · , an αn ) · · · pknn (an α1 , · · · , an αn )
k1 +···+kn

Now the given polynomial is of the form
an

n
∏

(x − αj )

and so the coeﬃcient of xn−k is pk (α1 , · · · , αn ) an = an−k . Also
pk (an α1 , · · · , an αn ) = akn pk (α1 , · · · , αn ) = akn

an−k

It follows
f (an α1 , · · · , an αn ) =

which is an integer. To see the last claim follows from this, take the symmetric polynomial
in α1 , · · · , αn and multiply by the product of the denominators of the rational coeﬃcients
to get one which has integer coeﬃcients. Then by the ﬁrst part, each homogeneous term is
just an integer divided by an raised to some power. 

The Fundamental Theorem Of Algebra

This is devoted to a mostly algebraic proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. It
depends on the interesting results about symmetric polynomials which are presented above.
I found it on the Wikipedia article about the fundamental theorem of algebra. You google

448

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

“fundamental theorem of algebra” and go to the Wikipedia article. It gives several other
proofs in addition to this one. According to this article, the ﬁrst completely correct proof
of this major theorem is due to Argand in 1806. Gauss and others did it earlier but their
arguments had gaps in them.
You can’t completely escape analysis when you prove this theorem. The necessary analysis is in the following lemma.
Lemma F.2.1 Suppose p (x) = xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0 where n is odd and the
coeﬃcients are real. Then p (x) has a real root.
Proof: This follows from the intermediate value theorem from calculus.
Next is an algebraic consideration. First recall some notation.
m
∏

ai ≡ a1 a2 · · · am

i=1

Recall a polynomial in {z1 , · · · , zn } is symmetric only if it can be written as a sum of
elementary symmetric polynomials raised to various powers multiplied by constants. This
follows from Proposition F.1.3 or Theorem F.1.3 both of which are the theorem on symmetric
polynomials.
The following is the main part of the theorem. In fact this is one version of the fundamental theorem of algebra which people studied earlier in the 1700’s.
Lemma F.2.2 Let p (x) = xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0 be a polynomial with real coefﬁcients. Then it has a complex root.
Proof: It is possible to write
n = 2k m
where m is odd. If n is odd, k = 0. If n is even, keep dividing by 2 until you are left with
an odd number. If k = 0 so that n is odd, it follows from Lemma F.2.1 that p (x) has a
real, hence complex root. The proof will be by induction on k, the case k = 0 being done.
Suppose then that it works for n = 2l m where m is odd and l ≤ k − 1 and let n = 2k m
where m is odd. Let {z1 , · · · , zn } be the roots of the polynomial in a splitting ﬁeld, the
existence of this ﬁeld being given by the above proposition. Then
p (x) =

n
∏

(x − zj ) =

j=1

n
∑

k

(−1) pk xk

(6.1)

k=0

where pk is the k th elementary symmetric polynomial. Note this shows
k

an−k = pk (−1) .

(6.2)

There is another polynomial which has coeﬃcients which are sums of real numbers times
the pk raised to various powers and it is
∏
qt (x) ≡
(x − (zi + zj + tzi zj )) , t ∈ R
1≤i<j≤n

I need to verify this is really the case for qt (x). When you switch any two of the zi in qt (x)
the polynomial does not change. For example, let n = 3 when qt (x) is
(x − (z1 + z2 + tz1 z2 )) (x − (z1 + z3 + tz1 z3 )) (x − (z2 + z3 + tz2 z3 ))

The Saylor Foundation

F.2. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA

449

and you can observe the assertion about the polynomial is true when you switch two different zi . Thus the coeﬃcients of qt (x) must be symmetric polynomials in the zi with real
coeﬃcients. Hence by Proposition F.1.3 these coeﬃcients are real polynomials in terms of
the elementary symmetric polynomials pk . Thus by (6.2) the coeﬃcients of qt (x) are real
polynomials in terms of the ak of the original polynomial. Recall these were all real. It
follows, and this is what was wanted,(that)qt (x) has all real coeﬃcients.
n
Note that the degree of qt (x) is
because there are this number of ways to pick
2
i < j out of {1, · · · , n}. Now
(
)
(
)
n (n − 1)
n
= 2k−1 m 2k m − 1
=
2
2
= 2k−1 (odd)
and so by induction, for each t ∈ R, qt (x) has a complex root.
There must exist s ̸= t such that for a single pair of indices i, j, with i < j,
(zi + zj + tzi zj ) , (zi + zj + szi zj )
are both complex. Here is why. Let A (i, j) denote those t ∈ R such that (zi + zj + tzi zj ) is
complex. It was just shown that every t ∈ R must be in some A (i, j). There are inﬁnitely
many t ∈ R and so some A (i, j) contains two of them.
Now for that t, s,
zi + zj + tzi zj
zi + zj + szi zj

=
=

a
b

where t ̸= s and so by Cramer’s rule,

zi + zj =

a t
b s
1 t
1 s

∈C

and also
zi zj =

1 a
1 b
1 t
1 s

∈C

At this point, note that zi , zj are both solutions to the equation
x2 − (z1 + z2 ) x + z1 z2 = 0,
which from the above has complex coeﬃcients. By the quadratic formula the zi , zj are both
complex. Thus the original polynomial has a complex root. 
With this lemma, it is easy to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra. The diﬀerence
between the lemma and this theorem is that in the theorem, the coeﬃcients are only assumed
to be complex. What this means is that if you have any polynomial with complex coeﬃcients
it has a complex root and so it is not irreducible. Hence the ﬁeld extension is the same ﬁeld.
Another way to say this is that for every complex polynomial there exists a factorization
into linear factors or in other words a splitting ﬁeld for a complex polynomial is the ﬁeld of
complex numbers.

Theorem F.2.3 Let p (x) ≡ an xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0 be any complex polynomial,
n ≥ 1, an ̸= 0. Then it has a complex root. Furthermore, there exist complex numbers
z1 , · · · , zn such that
n
∏
p (x) = an
(x − zk )
k=1

Proof: First suppose an = 1. Consider the polynomial
q (x) ≡ p (x) p (x)
this is a polynomial and it has real coeﬃcients. This is because it equals
( n
)
x + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0 ·
( n
)
x + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0
The xj+k term of the above product is of the form
ak xk aj xj + ak xk aj xj = xk+j (ak aj + ak aj )
and
ak aj + ak aj = ak aj + ak aj
so it is of the form of a complex number added to its conjugate. Hence q (x) has real
coeﬃcients as claimed. Therefore, by by Lemma F.2.2 it has a complex root z. Hence either
p (z) = 0 or p (z) = 0. Thus p (x) has a complex root.
Next suppose an ̸= 0. Then simply divide by it and get a polynomial in which an = 1.
Denote this modiﬁed polynomial as q (x). Then by what was just shown and the Euclidean
algorithm, there exists z1 ∈ C such that
q (x) = (x − z1 ) q1 (x)
where q1 (x) has complex coeﬃcients. Now do the same thing for q1 (x) to obtain
q (x) = (x − z1 ) (x − z2 ) q2 (x)
and continue this way. Thus

Obviously this is a harder proof than the other proof of the fundamental theorem of
algebra presented earlier. However, this is a better proof. Consider the algebraic numbers A consisting of the real numbers which are roots of some polynomial having rational
coeﬃcients. By Theorem 8.3.32 they are a ﬁeld. Now consider the ﬁeld A + iA with the
usual conventions for complex arithmetic. You could repeat the above argument with small
changes and conclude that every polynomial having coeﬃcients in A + iA has a root in
A + iA. Recall from Problem 41 on Page 223 that A is countable and so this is also the case
for A + iA. Thus this gives an algebraically complete ﬁeld which is countable and so very
diﬀerent than C. Of course there are other situations in which the above harder proof will
work and yield interesting results.

Most numbers are like this. Here the algebraic numbers are those which are roots of a
polynomial equation having rational numbers as coeﬃcients. By the fundamental theorem
of calculus, all these numbers are in C. There are only countably many of these algebraic
numbers, (Problem 41 on Page 223). Therefore, most numbers are transcendental. Nevertheless, it is very hard to prove that this or that number is transcendental. Probably the
most famous theorem about this is the Lindemannn Weierstrass theorem.

It follows that for j < p − 1, f (j) (0) = 0. This is because of that term xp−1 . If j ≥ p, f (j) (0)
is an integer multiple of p. Here is why. The terms in this derivative which are nonzero
involve taking p − 1 derivatives of xp−1 and this introduces a (p − 1)! which cancels out the
denominator. Then there are some other derivatives of the product of the (x − β i ) raised
to the power p. By the chain rule, these all involve a multiple of p. Thus this j th derivative
is of the form
pg (x, vβ 1 , · · · , vβ m ) ,
(6.8)
where g (x, vβ 1 , · · · , vβ m ) is a polynomial in x with coeﬃcients which are symmetric polynomials in {vβ 1 , · · · , vβ m } having integer coeﬃcients. Then derivatives of g with respect
to x also yield polynomials in x which have coeﬃcients which are symmetric polynomials
in {vβ 1 , · · · , vβ m } having integer coeﬃcients. Evaluating g at x = 0 must therefore yield
a polynomial which is symmetric in the {vβ 1 , · · · , vβ m } with integer coeﬃcients. Since the
{β 1 , · · · , β m } are the roots of a polynomial having integer coeﬃcients with leading coeﬃcient v, it follows from Theorem F.1.4 that this last polynomial is an integer and so the
j th derivative of f given by (6.8) when evaluated at x = 0 yields an integer times p. Now
consider the case of the (p − 1) derivative of f . The only nonzero term of f (j) (0) is the one
which comes from taking p − 1 derivatives of xp−1 and so it reduces to
v mp (−1)

mp

(β 1 β 2 · · · β m )

m

Now Q (0) = v (−1) (β 1 β 2 · · · β m ) = u and so v p (−1)

mp

p
p

(β 1 β 2 · · · β m ) = up which yields

f (p−1) (0) = v mp up v −p = v p(m−1) up
Note this is not necessarily a multiple of p and in fact will not be so if p > u, v because p is
a prime number. It follows
n
∑

f (j) (0) = v p(m−1) up + m (p) p

j=0

where m (p) is some integer.
Now consider the other sum in (6.6),
c

m ∑
n
∑

f (j) (β i )

i=1 j=0

Using the formula in (6.7) it follows that for j < p, f (j) (β i ) = 0. This is because for such
derivatives, each term will have that product of the (x − β i ) in it. Next consider the case
where j ≥ p. In this case, the nonzero terms must involve at least p derivatives of the
expression
p
((x − β 1 ) (x − β 2 ) · · · (x − β m ))
since otherwise, when evaluated at any β k the result would be 0. Hence the (p − 1)! will
vanish from the denominator and so all coeﬃcients of the polynomials in the β j and x will
be integers and in fact, there will be an extra factor of p left over. Thus the j th derivatives
for j ≥ p involve taking the k th derivative, k ≥ 0 with respect to x of
pv mp g (x, β 1 , · · · , β m )
where g (x, β 1 , · · · , β m ) is a polynomial in x having coeﬃcients which are integers times
symmetric polynomials in the {β 1 , · · · , β m } . It follows that the k th derivative for k ≥ 0

Note this shows π is irrational. If π = k/m where k, m are integers, then both iπ and
−iπ are roots of the polynomial with integer coeﬃcients,
m2 x2 + k 2
which would require from what was just shown that

Next is an even more interesting Lemma which follows from the above corollary.
Lemma F.3.4 If b0 , b1 , · · · , bn are non zero integers, and γ 1 , · · · , γ n are distinct algebraic
numbers, then
b0 eγ 0 + b1 eγ 1 + · · · + bn eγ n ̸= 0
Proof: Assume
b0 eγ 0 + b1 eγ 1 + · · · + bn eγ n = 0

(6.11)

Divide by eγ 0 and letting K = b0 ,
K + b1 eα(1) + · · · + bn eα(n) = 0

(6.12)

where α (k) = γ k − γ 0 . These are still distinct algebraic numbers none of which is 0 thanks
to Theorem 8.3.32. Therefore, α (k) is a root of a polynomial
vk xmk + · · · + uk

(6.13)

having integer coeﬃcients, vk , uk ̸= 0. Recall algebraic numbers were deﬁned as roots of
polynomial equations having rational coeﬃcients. Just multiply by the denominators to get
one with integer coeﬃcients. Let the roots of this polynomial equation be
{
}
α (k)1 , · · · , α (k)mk
and suppose they are listed in such a way that α (k)1 = α (k). Letting ik be an integer in
{1, · · · , mk } it follows from the assumption (6.11) that

This is because one of the factors is the one occurring in (6.12) when ik = 1 for every k. The
product is taken over all distinct ordered lists (i1 , · · · , in ) where ik is as indicated. Expand
this possibly huge product. This will yield something like the following.

where each i′k is another index in{{1, · · · , mik } and

corresponds to such a choice of bk1 , · · · , bkn−p which leads to K p+1 bk1 · · · bkn−p times a
sum of exponentials like those just described. Since the product in (6.14) is taken over all
choices ik ∈ {1, · · · , mk } , it follows that if you switch α (r)i and α (r)j , two of the roots of
the polynomial
vr xmr + · · · + ur
mentioned above, the result in (6.15) would be the same except for permuting the
β (s)1 , β (s)2 , · · · , β (s)µ(s) .
Thus a symmetric polynomial in
β (s)1 , β (s)2 , · · · , β (s)µ(s)
is also a symmetric polynomial in the α (k)1 , α (k)2 , · · · , α (k)mk for each k. Thus for a
given r, β (r)1 , · · · , β (r)µ(r) are roots of the polynomial
(
)
(x − β (r)1 ) (x − β (r)2 ) · · · x − β (r)µ(r)
whose coeﬃcients are symmetric polynomials in the β (r)j which is a symmetric polynomial
in the α (k)j , j = 1, · · · , mk for each k. Letting g be one of these symmetric polynomials

where Bk1 ···kmn is a symmetric polynomial in α (k)j , j = 1, · · · , mk for each k ≤ n − 1. Now
do for each Bk1 ···kmn what was just done for g featuring this time
{
}
α (n − 1)1 , · · · , α (n − 1)mn−1
and continuing this way, it must be the case that eventually you have a sum of integer
multiples of products of elementary symmetric polynomials in α (k)j , j = 1, · · · , mk for
each k ≤ n. By Theorem F.1.4, these are each rational numbers. Therefore, each such g is
a rational number and so the β (r)j are algebraic. Now (6.15) contradicts Corollary F.3.3.

Note this lemma is suﬃcient to prove Lindemann’s theorem that π is transcendental.
Here is why. If π is algebraic, then so is iπ and so from this lemma, e0 + eiπ ̸= 0 but this is
not the case because eiπ = −1.
The next theorem is the main result, the Lindemannn Weierstrass theorem.
Theorem F.3.5 Suppose a (1) , · · · , a (n) are nonzero algebraic numbers and suppose
α (1) , · · · , α (n)
are distinct algebraic numbers. Then
a (1) eα(1) + a (2) eα(2) + · · · + a (n) eα(n) ̸= 0
Proof: Suppose a (j) ≡ a (j)1 is a root of the polynomial
v j x mj + · · · + u j
where vj , uj ̸= 0. Let the roots of this polynomial be a (j)1 , · · · , a (j)mj . Suppose to the
contrary that
a (1)1 eα(1) + a (2)1 eα(2) + · · · + a (n)1 eα(n) = 0
Then consider the big product

(6.16)

the product taken over all ordered lists (i1 , · · · , in ) . This product equals
0 = b1 eβ(1) + b2 eβ(2) + · · · + bN eβ(N )

(6.17)

where the β (j) are the distinct exponents which result. The β (i) are clearly algebraic
because they are the sum of the α (i). Since the product in (6.16) is taken for all ordered
lists as described above, it follows that for a given k,if α (k)i is switched with α (k)j , that is,
two of the roots of vk xmk +· · ·+uk are switched, then the product is unchanged and so (6.17)
is also unchanged. Thus each bk is a symmetric polynomial in the a (k)j , j = 1, · · · , mk for
each k. It follows

This theorem is suﬃcient to show e is transcendental. If it were algebraic, then

More On Algebraic Field Extensions

The next few sections have to do with ﬁelds and ﬁeld extensions. There are many linear
algebra techniques which are used in this discussion and it seems to me to be very interesting.
However, this is deﬁnitely far removed from my own expertise so there may be some parts of
this which are not too good. I am following various algebra books in putting this together.
Consider the notion of splitting ﬁelds. It is desired to show that any two are isomorphic,
meaning that there exists a one to one and onto mapping from one to the other which
preserves all the algebraic structure. To begin with, here is a theorem about extending
homomorphisms. [17]
Deﬁnition F.4.1 Suppose F, F̄ are two ﬁelds and that f : F → F̄ is a homomorphism. This
means that
f (xy) = f (x) f (y) , f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y)
An isomorphism is a homomorphism which is one to one and onto. A monomorphism is
a homomorphism which is one to one. An automorphism is an isomorphism of a single
ﬁeld. Sometimes people use the symbol ≃ to indicate something is an isomorphism. Then if
p (x) ∈ F [x] , say

p (x) =

p̄ (x) will be the polynomial in F̄ [x] deﬁned as
p̄ (x) ≡

n
∑

f (ak ) xk .

k=0

Also consider f as a homomorphism of F [x] and F̄ [x] in the obvious way.
f (p (x)) = p̄ (x)
The following is a nice theorem which will be useful.
Theorem F.4.2 Let F be a ﬁeld and let r be algebraic over F. Let p (x) be the minimal
polynomial of r. Thus p (r) = 0 and p (x) is monic and no nonzero polynomial having
coeﬃcients in F of smaller degree has r as a root. In particular, p (x) is irreducible over F.
Then deﬁne f : F [x] → F [r] , the polynomials in r by
(m
)
m
∑
∑
f
ai x i ≡

i=0

i=0

Then f is a homomorphism. Also, deﬁning g : F [x] / (p (x)) by
g ([q (x)]) ≡ f (q (x)) ≡ q (r)
it follows that g is an isomorphism from the ﬁeld F [x] / (p (x)) to F [r] .
Proof: First of all, consider why f is a homomorphism. The preservation of sums is
obvious. Consider products.



Thus it is clear that f is a homomorphism.
First consider why g is even well deﬁned. If [q (x)] = [q1 (x)] , this means that
q1 (x) − q (x) = p (x) l (x)
for some l (x) ∈ F [x]. Therefore,
f (q1 (x))

= f (q (x)) + f (p (x) l (x))
= f (q (x)) + f (p (x)) f (l (x))
≡ q (r) + p (r) l (r) = q (r) = f (q (x))

Now from this, it is obvious that g is a homomorphism.
g ([q (x)] [q1 (x)])
g ([q (x)]) g ([q1 (x)])

= g ([q (x) q1 (x)]) = f (q (x) q1 (x)) = q (r) q1 (r)
≡ q (r) q1 (r)

Similarly, g preserves sums. Now why is g one to one? It suﬃces to show that if g ([q (x)]) = 0,
then [q (x)] = 0. Suppose then that
g ([q (x)]) ≡ q (r) = 0

Then
q (x) = p (x) l (x) + ρ (x)
where the degree of ρ (x) is less than the degree of p (x) or else ρ (x) = 0. If ρ (x) ̸= 0, then
it follows that
ρ (r) = 0
and ρ (x) has smaller degree than that of p (x) which contradicts the deﬁnition of p (x) as the
minimal polynomial of r. Since p (x) is irreducible, F [x] / (p (x)) is a ﬁeld. It is clear that g
is onto. Therefore, F [r] is a ﬁeld also. (This was shown earlier by diﬀerent reasoning.) 

Theorem F.4.3 Let f : F → F̄ be an isomorphism of the two ﬁelds. Let r be algebraic
over F with minimal polynomial p (x) and suppose there exists r̄ algebraic over F̄ such that
p̄ (r̄) = 0. Then there exists an isomorphism g : F [r] → F̄ [r̄] which agrees with f on F. If
g : F [r] → F̄ [r̄] is an isomorphism which agrees with f on F and if α ([k (x)]) ≡ k (r) is the
homomorphism mapping F [x] / (p (x)) to F [r] , then there must exist r̄ such that p̄ (r̄) = 0
and g = βα−1 where β
β : F [x] / (p (x)) → F̄ [r̄]
is given by β ([k (x)]) = k̄ (r̄) . In particular, g (r) = r̄.
Proof: From Theorem F.4.2, there exists α, an isomorphism in the following picture,
α ([k (x)]) = k (r).
α

β

F [r] ← F [x] / (p (x)) → F̄ [r̄]
where β ([k (x)]) ≡ k̄ (r̄) . (k̄ (x) comes from f as described in the above deﬁnition.) This β
is a well deﬁned monomorphism because of the assumption that p̄ (r̄) = 0. This needs to be
veriﬁed. Assume then that it is so. Then just let g = βα−1 .
Why is β well deﬁned? Suppose [k (x)] = [k ′ (x)] so that k (x) − k ′ (x) = l (x) p (x) . Then
since f is a homomorphism,
k̄ (x) − k̄ ′ (x) = ¯l (x) p̄ (x) , k̄ (r̄) − ḡ k̄ ′ (r̄) = ¯l (r̄) p̄ (r̄) = 0
so β is indeed well deﬁned. It is clear from the deﬁnition that β is a homomorphism. Suppose
β ([k (x)]) = 0. Does it follow that [k (x)] = 0? By assumption, ḡ (r̄) = 0 and also,
k̄ (x) = p̄ (x) ¯l (x) + ρ̄ (x)
where the degree of ρ̄ (x) is less than the degree of p̄ (x) or else it equals 0. But then, since
f is an isomorphism,
k (x) = p (x) l (x) + ρ (x)

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

where the degree of ρ (x) is less than the degree of p (x) . However, the above shows that
ρ (r) = 0 contrary to p (x) being the minimal polynomial. Hence ρ (x) = 0 and this implies
that [k (x)] = 0. Thus β is one to one and a homomorphism. Hence g = βα−1 works if it
is also onto. However, it is clear that α−1 is onto and that β is onto. Hence the desired
extension exists.
Now suppose such an isomorphism g exists. Then r̄ must equal g (r) and
0 = g (p (r)) = p̄ (g (r)) = p̄ (r̄)
Hence, β can be deﬁned as above as β ([k (x)]) ≡ k̄ (r̄) relative to this r̄ ≡ g (r) and
βα−1 (k (r)) ≡ β ([k (x)]) ≡ k̄ (g (r)) = g (k (r))

What is the meaning of the above in simple terms? It says that the monomorphisms
from F [r] to a ﬁeld K̄ containing F̄ correspond to the roots of p̄ (x) in K̄. That is, for each
root of p̄ (x), there is a monomorphism and for each monomorphism, there is a root. Also,
for each root r̄ of p̄ (x) in K̄, there is an isomorphism from F [r] to F̄ [r̄].
Note that if p (x) is a monic irreducible polynomial, then it is the minimal polynomial
for each of its roots. This is the situation which is about to be considered. It involves the
splitting ﬁelds K, K̄ of p (x) , p̄ (x) where η is an isomorphism of F and F̄ as described above.
See [17]. Here is a little diagram which describes what this theorem says.
Deﬁnition F.4.4 The symbol [K : F] where K is a ﬁeld extension of F means the dimension
of the vector space K with ﬁeld of scalars F.

Theorem F.4.5 Let η be an isomorphism from F to F̄ and let K = F [r1 , · · · , rn ] , K̄ =
F̄ [r̄1 , · · · , r̄n ] be splitting ﬁelds of p (x) and p̄ (x) respectively. Then there exist at most
[K : F] isomorphisms ζ i : K → K̄ which extend η. If {r̄1 , · · · , r̄n } are distinct, then there
exist exactly [K : F] isomorphisms of the above sort. In either case, the two splitting ﬁelds
are isomorphic with any of these ζ i serving as an isomorphism.
Proof: Suppose [K : F] = 1. Say a basis for K is {r} . Then {1, r} is dependent and so
there exist a, b ∈ F, not both zero such that a + br = 0. Then it follows that r ∈ F and so in
this case F = K. Then the isomorphism which extends η is just η itself and there is exactly
1 isomorphism.
Next suppose [K : F] > 1. Then p (x) has an irreducible factor over F of degree larger
than 1, q (x). If not, you would have
p (x) = xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + an
and it would factor as
= (x − r1 ) · · · (x − rn )
with each rj ∈ F, so F = K contrary to [K : F] > 1.Without loss of generality, let the roots
of q (x) in K be {r1 , · · · , rm }. Thus

Now q̄ (x) deﬁned analogously to p (x) , also has degree at least 2. Furthermore, it divides
p̄ (x) all of whose roots are in K̄. Denote the roots of q̄ (x) in K as {r̄1 , · · · , r̄m } where they
are counted according to multiplicity.
Then from Theorem F.4.3, there exist k ≤ m one to one homomorphisms ζ i mapping
F [r1 ] to K̄, one for each distinct root of q̄ (x) in K̄. If the roots of p̄ (x) are distinct, then
this is suﬃcient to imply that the roots of q̄ (x) are also distinct, and k = m. Otherwise,
maybe k < m. (It is conceivable that q̄ (x) might have repeated roots in K̄.) Then
[K : F] = [K : F [r1 ]] [F [r1 ] : F]
and since the degree of q (x) > 1 and q (x) is irreducible, this shows that [F [r1 ] : F] = m > 1
and so
[K : F [r1 ]] < [K : F]
Therefore, by induction, each of these k ≤ m = [F [r1 ] : F] one to one homomorphisms
extends to an isomorphism from K to K̄ and for each of these ζ i , there are no more than
[K : F [r1 ]] of these isomorphisms extending F. If the roots of p̄ (x) are distinct, then there
are exactly m of these ζ i and for each, there are [K : F [r1 ]] extensions. Therefore, if the
roots of p̄ (x) are distinct, this has identiﬁed
[K : F [r1 ]] m = [K : F [r1 ]] [F [r1 ] : F] = [K : F]
isomorphisms of K to K̄ which agree with η on F. If the roots of p̄ (x) are not distinct, then
maybe there are fewer than [K : F] extensions of η.
Is this all of them? Suppose ζ is such an isomorphism of K and K̄. Then consider its
restriction to F [r1 ] . By Theorem F.4.3, this restriction must coincide with one of the ζ i
chosen earlier. Then by induction, ζ is one of the extensions of the ζ i just mentioned. 
Deﬁnition F.4.6 Let K be a ﬁnite dimensional extension of a ﬁeld F such that every element of K is algebraic over F, that is, each element of K is a root of some polynomial
in F [x]. Then K is called a normal extension if for every k ∈ K all roots of the minimal
polynomial of k are contained in K.
So what are some ways to tell a ﬁeld is a normal extension? It turns out that if K is a
splitting ﬁeld of f (x) ∈ F [x] , then K is a normal extension. I found this in [17]. This is an
amazing result.
Proposition F.4.7 Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of f (x) ∈ F [x]. Then K is a normal extension.
In fact, if L is an intermediate ﬁeld between F and K, then L is also a normal extension of
F.
Proof: Let r ∈ K be a root of g (x), an irreducible monic polynomial in F [x]. It is
required to show that every other root of g (x) is in K. Let the roots of g (x) in a splitting
ﬁeld be {r1 = r, r2 , · · · , rm }. Now g (x) is the minimal polynomial of rj over F because g (x)
is irreducible. Recall why this was. If p (x) is the minimal polynomial of rj ,
g (x) = p (x) l (x) + r (x)
where r (x) either is 0 or it has degree less than the degree of p (x) . However, r (rj ) = 0 and
this is impossible if p (x) is the minimal polynomial. Hence r (x) = 0 and now it follows
that g (x) was not irreducible unless l (x) = 1.
By Theorem F.4.3, there exists an isomorphism η of F [r1 ] and F [rj ] which ﬁxes F and
maps r1 to rj . Now K [r1 ] and K [rj ] are splitting ﬁelds of f (x) over F [r1 ] and F [rj ] respectively. By Theorem F.4.5, the two ﬁelds K [r1 ] and K [rj ] are isomorphic, the isomorphism,
ζ extending η. Hence
[K [r1 ] : K] = [K [rj ] : K]

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

But r1 ∈ K and so K [r1 ] = K. Therefore, K = K [rj ] and so rj is also in K. Thus all the
roots of g (x) are actually in K. Consider the last assertion.
Suppose r = r1 ∈ L where the minimal polynomial for r is denoted by q (x). Then
letting the roots of q (x) in K be {r1 , · · · , rm }. By Theorem F.4.3 applied to the identity
map on L, there exists an isomorphism θ : L [r1 ] → L [rj ] which ﬁxes L and takes r1 to rj .
But this implies that
1 = [L [r1 ] : L] = [L [rj ] : L]
Hence rj ∈ L also. Since r was an arbitrary element of L, this shows that L is normal. 
Deﬁnition F.4.8 When you have F [a1 , · · · , am ] with each ai algebraic so that F [a1 , · · · , am ]
is a ﬁeld, you could consider
m
∏
f (x) ≡
fi (x)
i=1

where fi (x) is the minimal polynomial of ai . Then if K is a splitting ﬁeld for f (x) , this K
is called the normal closure. It is at least as large as F [a1 , · · · , am ] and it has the advantage
of being a normal extension.

F.5

The Galois Group

In the case where F = F̄, the above suggests the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition F.5.1 When K is a splitting ﬁeld for a polynomial p (x) having coeﬃcients in
F, we say that K is a splitting ﬁeld of p (x) over the ﬁeld F. Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of
p (x) over the ﬁeld F. Then G (K, F) denotes the group of automorphisms of K which leave
F ﬁxed. For a ﬁnite set S, denote by |S| as the number of elements of S. More generally,
when K is a ﬁnite extension of L, denote by G (K, L) the group of automorphisms of K
which leave L ﬁxed.
It is shown later that G (K, F) really is a group according to the strict deﬁnition of a
group. For right now, just regard it as a set of automorphisms which keeps F ﬁxed. Theorem
F.4.5 implies the following important result.
Theorem F.5.2 Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of p (x) over the ﬁeld F. Then
|G (K, F)| ≤ [K : F]
When the roots of p (x) are distinct, equality holds in the above.
So how large is |G (K, F)| in case p (x) is a polynomial of degree n which has n distinct
roots? Let p (x) be a monic polynomial with roots in K, {r1 , · · · , rn } and suppose that none
of the ri is in F. Thus
xn + a1 xn−1 + a2 xn−2 + · · · + an
n
∏

(x − rk ) , ai ∈ F

p (x) =

Thus K consists of all rational functions in the r1 , · · · , rn . Let σ be a mapping from
{r1 , · · · , rn } to {r1 , · · · , rn } , say rj → rij . In other words σ produces a permutation of
these roots. Consider the following way of obtaining something in G (K, F) from σ. If you
have a typical thing in K, you can obtain another thing in K by replacing each rj with rij in

a rational function, a quotient of two polynomials which have coeﬃcients in F. Furthermore,
if you do this, you can see right away that the resulting map form K to K is obviously an automorphism, preserving the operations of multiplication and addition. Does it keep F ﬁxed?
Of course. You don’t change the coeﬃcients of the polynomials in the rational function
which are always in F. Thus every permutation of the roots determines an automorphism
of K. Now suppose σ is an automorphism of K. Does it determine a permutation of the
roots?
0 = σ (p (ri )) = σ (p (σ (ri )))
and so σ (ri ) is also a root, say rij . Thus it is clear that each σ ∈ G (K, F) determines
a permutation of the roots. Since the roots are distinct, it follows that |G (K, F)| equals
the number of permutations of {r1 , · · · , rn } which is n! and that there is a one to one
correspondence between the permutations of the roots and G (K, F) . More will be done on
this later after discussing permutation groups.
This is a good time to make a very important observation about irreducible polynomials.
Lemma F.5.3 Suppose q (x) ̸= p (x) are both irreducible polynomials over a ﬁeld F. Then
for K a ﬁeld which contains all the roots of both polynomials, there is no root common to
both p (x) and q (x).
Proof: If l (x) is a monic polynomial which divides them both, then l (x) must equal
1. Otherwise, it would equal p (x) and q (x) which would require these two to be equal.
Thus p (x) and q (x) are relatively prime and there exist polynomials a (x) , b (x) having
coeﬃcients in F such that
a (x) p (x) + b (x) q (x) = 1
Now if p (x) and q (x) share a root r, then (x − r) divides both sides of the above in K [x],
but this is impossible. 
Now here is an important deﬁnition of a class of polynomials which yield equality in the
inequality of Theorem F.5.2.
Deﬁnition F.5.4 Let p (x) be a polynomial having coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld F. Also let K be a
splitting ﬁeld. Then p (x) is separable if it is of the form
p (x) =

m
∏

qi (x)

ki

i=1

where each qi (x) is irreducible over F and each qi (x) has distinct roots in K. From the
above lemma, no two qi (x) share a root. Thus
p1 (x) ≡

m
∏

qi (x)

i=1

has distinct roots in K.
For example, consider the case where F = Q and the polynomial is of the form
(

x2 + 1

)2 ( 2
)2
x − 2 = x8 − 2x6 − 3x4 + 4x2 + 4

[ √ ]
Then let K be the splitting ﬁeld over Q, Q i, 2 .The polynomials x2 + 1 and x2 − 2 are
irreducible over Q and each has distinct roots in K.
This is also a convenient time to show that G (K, F) for K a ﬁnite extension of F really
is a group. First, here is the deﬁnition.

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

Deﬁnition F.5.5 A group G is a nonempty set with an operation, denoted here as · such
that the following axioms hold.
1. For α, β, γ ∈ G, (α · β) · γ = α · (β · γ) . We usually don’t bother to write the ·.
2. There exists ι ∈ G such that αι = ια = α
3. For every α ∈ G, there exists α−1 ∈ G such that αα−1 = α−1 α = ι.
Then why is G ≡ G (K, F) , where K is a ﬁnite extension of F, a group? If you simply
look at the automorphisms of K then it is obvious that this is a group with the operation
being composition. Also, from Theorem F.4.5 |G (K, F)| is ﬁnite. Clearly ι ∈ G. It is
just the automorphism which takes everything to itself. The operation in this case is just
composition. Thus the associative law is obvious. What about the existence of the inverse?
Clearly, you can deﬁne the inverse of α, but does it ﬁx F? If α = ι, then the inverse is clearly
ι. Otherwise, consider α, α2 , · · · . Since |G (K, F)| is( ﬁnite,
is a repeat. Thus
)meventually there
to get ι = ααn−m . Hence α−1 is
αm = αn , n > m. Simply multiply on the left by α−1
a suitable power of α and so α−1 obviously leaves F ﬁxed. Thus G (K, F) which has been
called a group all along, really is a group.
Then the following corollary is the reason why separable polynomials are so important.
Also, one can show that if F contains a ﬁeld which is isomorphic to Q then every polynomial
with coeﬃcients in F is separable. This will be done later after presenting the big results.
This is equivalent to saying that the ﬁeld has characteristic zero. In addition, the property
of being separable holds in other situations which are described later.
Corollary F.5.6 Let K
separable. Then

be a splitting ﬁeld of p (x) over the ﬁeld F. Assume p (x) is
|G (K, F)| = [K : F]

Proof: Just note that K is also the splitting ﬁeld of p1 (x), the product of the distinct
irreducible factors and that from Lemma F.5.3, p1 (x) has distinct roots. Thus the conclusion
follows from Theorem F.4.5. 
What if L is an intermediate ﬁeld between F and K? Then p1 (x) still has coeﬃcients in
L and distinct roots in K and so it also follows that
|G (K, L)| = [K : L]
Deﬁnition F.5.7 Let G be a group of automorphisms of a ﬁeld K. Then denote by KG the
ﬁxed ﬁeld of G. Thus
KG ≡ {x ∈ K : σ (x) = x for all σ ∈ G}
Thus there are two new things, the ﬁxed ﬁeld of a group of automorphisms H denoted
by KH and the Gallois group G (K, L). How are these related? First here is a simple lemma
which comes from the deﬁnitions.
Lemma F.5.8 Let K be an algebraic extension of L (each element of L is a root of some
polynomial in L) for L, K ﬁelds. Then
(
)
G (K, L) = G K, KG(K,L)
Proof: It is clear that L ⊆ KG(K,L) because if r ∈ L then by deﬁnition, everything in
G (K, L) ﬁxes r and so r is in KG(K,L) . Therefore,
(
)
G (K, L) ⊇ G K, KG(K,L) .

F.5. THE GALOIS GROUP

467

Now let σ ∈ G (K, L) then it is one of the automorphisms
of K which
ﬁxes everything in
(
)
the ﬁxed ﬁeld of G (K, L) . Thus, by deﬁnition, σ ∈ G K, KG(K,L) and so the two are the
same. 
Now the following says that you can start with L, go to the group G (K, L) and then to
the ﬁxed ﬁeld of this group and end up back where you started. More precisely,
Proposition F.5.9 If K is a splitting ﬁeld of p (x) over the ﬁeld F for separable p (x) , and
if L is a ﬁeld between K and F, then K is also a splitting ﬁeld of p (x) over L and also
L = KG(K,L)
Proof: By the above lemma, and Corollary F.5.6,
[
][
]
|G (K, L)| = [K : L] = K : KG(K,L) KG(K,L) : L
(
) [
]
[
]
= G K, KG(K,L) KG(K,L) : L = |G (K, L)| KG(K,L) : L
[
]
which shows that KG(K,L) : L = 1 and so, since L ⊆ KG(K,L) , it follows that L = KG(K,L) .

This has shown the following diagram in the context of K being a splitting ﬁeld of a
separable polynomial over F and L being an intermediate ﬁeld.
L → G (K, L) → KG(K,L) = L
In particular, every intermediate ﬁeld is a ﬁxed ﬁeld of a subgroup of G (K, F). Is every
subgroup of G (K, F) obtained in the form G (K, L) for some intermediate ﬁeld? This involves
another estimate which is apparently due to Artin. I also found this in [17]. There is more
there about some of these things than what I am including.
Theorem F.5.10 Let K be a ﬁeld and let G be a ﬁnite group of automorphisms of K. Then
[K : KG ] ≤ |G|
Proof: Let G = {σ 1 , · · · , σ n } , σ 1 = ι the identity map and suppose {u1 , · · · , um } is a
linearly independent set in K with respect to the ﬁeld KG . Suppose m > n. Then consider
the system of equations
σ 1 (u1 ) x1 + σ 1 (u2 ) x2 + · · · + σ 1 (um ) xm = 0
σ 2 (u1 ) x1 + σ 2 (u2 ) x2 + · · · + σ 2 (um ) xm = 0
..
.

(6.18)

σ n (u1 ) x1 + σ n (u2 ) x2 + · · · + σ n (um ) xm = 0
which is of the form M x = 0 for x ∈ Km . Since M has more columns than rows, there
exists a nonzero solution x ∈ Km to the above system. Note that this could not happen if
x ∈ Km
G because of independence of {u1 , · · · , um } and the fact that σ 1 = ι. Let the solution
x be one which has the least possible number of nonzero entries. Without loss of generality,
some xk = 1 for some k. If σ r (xk ) = xk for all xk and for each r, then the xk are each
in KG and so the ﬁrst equation above would be impossible as just noted. Therefore, there
exists l ̸= k and σ r such that σ r (xl ) ̸= xl . For purposes of illustration, say l > k. Now
do σ r to both sides of all the above equations. This yields, after re ordering the resulting
equations a list of equations of the form
σ 1 (u1 ) σ r (x1 ) + · · · + σ 1 (uk ) 1 + · · · + σ 1 (ul ) σ r (xl ) + · · · + σ 1 (um ) σ r (xm ) = 0
σ 2 (u1 ) σ r (x1 ) + · · · + σ 2 (uk ) 1 + · · · + σ 2 (ul ) σ r (xl ) + · · · + σ 2 (um ) σ r (xm ) = 0
..
.
σ n (u1 ) σ r (x1 ) + · · · + σ n (uk ) 1 + · · · + σ n (ul ) σ r (xl ) + · · · + σ n (um ) σ r (xm ) = 0

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

This is because σ (1) = 1 if σ is an automorphism. The original system in (6.18) is of the
form
σ 1 (u1 ) x1 + · · · + σ 1 (uk ) 1 + · · · + σ 1 (ul ) xl + · · · + σ 1 (um ) xm = 0
σ 2 (u1 ) x1 + · · · + σ 2 (uk ) 1 + · · · + σ 1 (ul ) xl + · · · + σ 2 (um ) xm = 0
..
.
σ n (u1 ) x1 + · · · + σ n (uk ) 1 + · · · + σ 1 (ul ) xl + · · · + σ n (um ) xm = 0
Now replace the k th equation with the diﬀerence of the k th equations in the original system
and the one in which σ r was done to both sides of the equations. Since σ r (xl ) ̸= xl the
result will be a linear system of the form M y = 0 where y ̸= 0 has fewer nonzero entries
than x, contradicting the choice of x. 
With the above estimate, here is another relation between the ﬁxed ﬁelds and subgroups
of automorphisms. It doesn’t seem to depend on anything being a splitting ﬁeld of a
separable polynomial.
Proposition F.5.11 Let H be a ﬁnite group of automorphisms deﬁned on a ﬁeld K. Then
for KH the ﬁxed ﬁeld,
G (K, KH ) = H
Proof: If σ ∈ H, then by deﬁnition, σ ∈ G (K, KH ). It is clear that H ⊆ G (K, KH ) .
Then by Proposition F.5.10 and Theorem F.5.2,
|H| ≥ [K : KH ] ≥ |G (K, KH )| ≥ |H|
and so H = G (K, KH ). 
This leads to the following interesting correspondence in the case where K is a splitting
ﬁeld of a separable polynomial over a ﬁeld F.
β

Fixed ﬁelds

L → G (K, L)

Subgroups of G (K, F)

(6.19)

Then αβL = L and βαH = H. Thus there exists a one to one correspondence between the
ﬁxed ﬁelds and the subgroups of G (K, F). The following theorem summarizes the above
result.
Theorem F.5.12 Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial over a ﬁeld F. Then
there exists a one to one correspondence between the ﬁxed ﬁelds KH for H a subgroup of
G (K, F) and the intermediate ﬁelds as described in the above. H1 ⊆ H2 if and only if
KH1 ⊇ KH2 . Also
|H| = [K : KH ]
Proof: The one to one correspondence is established above. The claim about the ﬁxed
ﬁelds is obvious because if the group is larger, then the ﬁxed ﬁeld must get harder because it
is more diﬃcult to ﬁx everything using more automorphisms than with fewer automorphisms.
Consider the estimate. From Theorem F.5.10, |H| ≥ [K : KH ]. But also, H = G (K, KH )
from Proposition F.5.11 G (K, KH ) = H and from Theorem F.5.2,
|H| = |G (K, KH )| ≤ [K : KH ] .


Note that from the above discussion, when K is a splitting ﬁeld of p (x) ∈ F [x] , this
implies that if L is an intermediate ﬁeld, then it is also a ﬁxed ﬁeld of a subgroup of G (K, F).
In fact, from the above,
L = KG(K,L)

If H is a subgroup, then it is also the Galois group
H = G (K, KH ) .
By Proposition F.4.7, each of these intermediate ﬁelds L is also a normal extension of F.
Now there is also something called a normal subgroup which will end up corresponding with
these normal ﬁeld extensions consisting of the intermediate ﬁelds between F and K.

F.6

Normal Subgroups

When you look at groups, one of the ﬁrst things to consider is the notion of a normal
subgroup.
Deﬁnition F.6.1 Let G be a group. Then a subgroup N is said to be a normal subgroup if
whenever α ∈ G,
α−1 N α ⊆ N
The important thing about normal subgroups is that you can deﬁne the quotient group
G/N .
Deﬁnition F.6.2 Let N be a subgroup of G. Deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼ as follows.
α ∼ β means α−1 β ∈ N
Why is this an equivalence relation? It is clear that α ∼ α because α−1 α = ι ∈ N since
N is a subgroup. If α ∼ β, then α−1 β ∈ N and so, since N is a subgroup,
(

α−1 β

)−1

= β −1 α ∈ N

which shows that β ∼ α. Now suppose αα ∼ β, then α−1 β ∈ N and so, since N is a
subgroup,
( −1 )−1
α β
= β −1 α ∈ N
which shows that β ∼ α. Now suppose α ∼ β and β ∼ γ. Then α−1 β ∈ N and β −1 γ ∈ N.
Then since N is a subgroup
α−1 ββ −1 γ = α−1 γ ∈ N
and so α ∼ γ which shows that it is an equivalence relation as claimed. Denote by [α] the
equivalence class determined by α.
Now in the case of N a normal subgroup, you can consider the quotient group.
Deﬁnition F.6.3 Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G and deﬁne G/N as the set of
all equivalence classes with respect to the above equivalence relation. Also deﬁne
[α] [β] ≡ [αβ]
Proposition F.6.4 The above deﬁnition is well deﬁned and it also makes G/N into a
group.
Proof: First consider the claim that the deﬁnition is well deﬁned. Suppose then that
α ∼ α′ and β ∼ β ′ . It is required to show that

[αβ] = α′ β ′

Thus the operation[ is well

and the inverse is α−1 where α−1 is the inverse for α in G. The associative law is also
obvious. 
Note that it was important to have the subgroup be normal in order to have the operation
deﬁned on the quotient group.

Normal Extensions And Normal Subgroups

When K is a splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial having coeﬃcients in F, the intermediate
ﬁelds are each normal extensions from the above. If L is one of these, what about G (L, F)?
is this a normal subgroup of G (K, F)? More generally, consider the following diagram which
has now been established in the case that K is a splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial in
F [x].

The intermediate ﬁelds Li are each normal extensions of F each element of Li being algebraic.
As implied in the diagram, there is a one to one correspondence between the intermediate
ﬁelds and the Galois groups displayed. Is G (Lj−1 , F) a normal subgroup of G (Lj , F)?
Let σ ∈ G (Lj , F) and let η ∈ G (Lj−1 , F) . Then is σ −1 ησ ∈ G (Lj−1 , F)? Let r = r1
be something in Lj−1 and let {r1 , · · · , rm } be the roots of the minimal polynomial of r
denoted by f (x) , a polynomial having coeﬃcients in F. Then 0 = σf (r) = f (σ (r)) and
so σ (r) = rj for some j. Since Lj−1 is normal, σ (r) ∈ Lj−1 . Therefore, it is ﬁxed by η. It
follows that
σ −1 ησ (r) = σ −1 σ (r) = r
and so σ −1 ησ ∈ G (Lj−1 , F). Thus G (Lj−1 , F) is a normal subgroup of G (Lj , F) as hoped.
This leads to the following fundamental theorem of Galois theory.
Theorem F.7.1 Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial p (x) having coeﬃcients
k
in a ﬁeld F. Let {Li }i=0 be the increasing sequence of intermediate ﬁelds between F and K
as shown above in (6.20). Then each of these is a normal extension of F and the Galois
group G (Lj−1 , F) is a normal subgroup of G (Lj , F). In addition to this,
G (Lj , F) ≃ G (K, F) /G (K, Lj )
where the symbol ≃ indicates the two spaces are isomorphic.
Proof: All that remains is to check that the above isomorphism is valid. Let
θ : G (K, F) /G (K, Lj ) → G (Lj , F) , θ [σ] ≡ σ|Lj
In other words, this is just the restriction of σ to Lj . Is θ well deﬁned? If [σ 1 ] = [σ 2 ] , then
−1
by deﬁnition, σ 1 σ −1
ﬁxes everything in Lj . It follows that the
2 ∈ G (K, Lj ) and so σ 1 σ 2
restrictions of σ 1 and σ 2 to Lj are equal. Therefore, θ is well deﬁned. It is obvious that

θ is a homomorphism. Why is θ onto? This follows right away from Theorem F.4.5. Note
that K is the splitting ﬁeld of p (x) over Lj since Lj ⊇ F. Also if σ ∈ G (Lj , F) so it is an
automorphism of Lj , then, since it ﬁxes F, p (x) = p̄ (x) in that theorem. Thus σ extends to
ζ, an automorphism of K. Thus θζ = σ. Why is θ one to one? If θ [σ] = θ [α] , this means
σ = α on Lj . Thus σα−1 is the identity on Lj . Hence σα−1 ∈ G (K, Lj ) which is what it
means for [σ] = [α]. 
There is an immediate application to a description of the normal closure of an algebraic
extension F [a1 , a2 , · · · , am ] . To begin with, recall the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition F.7.2 When you have F [a1 , · · · , am ] with each ai algebraic so that F [a1 , · · · , am ]
is a ﬁeld, you could consider
m
∏
f (x) ≡
fi (x)
i=1

where fi (x) is the minimal polynomial of ai . Then if K is a splitting ﬁeld for f (x) , this K
is called the normal closure. It is at least as large as F [a1 , · · · , am ] and it has the advantage
of being a normal extension.
Let G (K, F) = {η 1 , η 2 , · · · , η m } . The conjugate ﬁelds are the ﬁelds
η j (F [a1 , · · · , am ])
Thus each of these ﬁelds is isomorphic to any other and they are all contained in K. Let K′
denote the smallest ﬁeld contained in K which contains all of these conjugate ﬁelds. Note
that if k ∈ F [a1 , · · · , am ] so that η i (k) is in one of these conjugate ﬁelds, then η j η i (k) is
also in a conjugate ﬁeld because η j η i is one of the automorphisms of G (K, F). Let
{
}
S = k ∈ K′ : η j (k) ∈ K′ each j .
Then from what was just shown, each conjugate ﬁeld is in S. Suppose k ∈ S. What about
k −1 ?
(
)
(
)
η j (k) η j k −1 = η j kk −1 = η j (1) = 1
(
)−1
(
)
(
)−1
and so η j (k)
= η j k −1 . Now η j (k)
∈ K′ because K′ is a ﬁeld. Therefore,
( −1 )
′
ηj k
∈ K . Thus S is closed with respect to taking inverses. It is also closed with
respect to products. Thus it is clear that S is a ﬁeld which contains each conjugate ﬁeld.
However, K′ was deﬁned as the smallest ﬁeld which contains the conjugate ﬁelds. Therefore,
S = K′ and so this shows that each η j maps K′ to itself while ﬁxing F. Thus G (K, F) ⊆
G (K′ , F) . However, since K′ ⊆ K, it follows that also G (K′ , F) ⊆ G (K, F) . Therefore,
G (K′ , F) = G (K, F) , and by the one to one correspondence between the intermediate ﬁelds
and the Galois groups, it follows that K′ = K. This proves the following lemma.
Lemma F.7.3 Let K denote the normal extension of F [a1 , · · · , am ] with each ai algebraic
so that F [a1 , · · · , am ] is a ﬁeld. Thus K is the splitting ﬁeld of the product of the minimal
polynomials of the ai . Then K is also the smallest ﬁeld containing the conjugate ﬁelds
η j (F [a1 , · · · , am ]) for {η 1 , η 2 , · · · , η m } = G (K, F).

Conditions For Separability

So when is it that a polynomial having coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld F is separable? It turns out
that this is always the case for ﬁelds which are enough like the rational numbers. It involves
considering the derivative of a polynomial. In doing this, there will be no analysis used, just

the rule for diﬀerentiation which we all learned in calculus. Thus the derivative is deﬁned
as follows.
(
)′
an xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0
≡ nan xn−1 + an−1 (n − 1) xn−2 + · · · + a1
This kind of formal manipulation is what most students do anyway, never thinking about
where it comes from. Here nan means to add an to itself n times. With this deﬁnition, it
is clear that the usual rules such as the product rule hold. This discussion follows [17].
Deﬁnition F.8.1 A ﬁeld has characteristic 0 if na ̸= 0 for all n ∈ N and a ̸= 0. Otherwise
a ﬁeld F has characteristic p if p · 1 = 0 for p · 1 deﬁned as 1 added to itself p times and p
is the smallest positive integer for which this takes place.
Note that with this deﬁnition, some of the terms of the derivative of a polynomial could
vanish in the case that the ﬁeld has characteristic p. I will go ahead and write them anyway.
For example, if the ﬁeld has characteristic p, then
′

(xp − a) = 0
because formally it equals p · 1xp−1 = 0xp−1 , the 1 being the 1 in the ﬁeld.
Note that the ﬁeld Zp does not have characteristic 0 because p · 1 = 0. Thus not all ﬁelds
have characteristic 0.
How can you tell if a polynomial has no repeated roots? This is the content of the next
theorem.
Theorem F.8.2 Let p (x) be a monic polynomial having coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld F, and let K
be a ﬁeld in which p (x) factors
p (x) =

n
∏

(x − ri ) , ri ∈ K.

i=1

Then the ri are distinct if and only if p (x) and p′ (x) are relatively prime over F.
Proof: Suppose ﬁrst that p′ (x) and p (x) are relatively prime over F. Since they are not
both zero, there exists polynomials a (x) , b (x) having coeﬃcients in F such that
a (x) p (x) + b (x) p′ (x) = 1
Now suppose p (x) has a repeated root r. Then in K [x] ,
2

p (x) = (x − r) g (x)
and so p′ (x) = 2 (x − r) g (x) + (x − r) g ′ (x). Then in K [x] ,
(
)
2
2
a (x) (x − r) g (x) + b (x) 2 (x − r) g (x) + (x − r) g ′ (x) = 1
2

Then letting x = r, it follows that 0 = 1. Hence p (x) has no repeated roots.
Next suppose there are no repeated roots of p (x). Then
p′ (x) =

n ∏
∑

(x − rj )

i=1 j̸=i

F.8. CONDITIONS FOR SEPARABILITY

473

p′ (x) cannot be zero in this case because
p′ (rn ) =

n−1
∏

(rn − rj ) ̸= 0

j=1

because it is the product of nonzero elements of K. Similarly no term in the sum for p′ (x)
can equal zero because
∏
(ri − rj ) ̸= 0.
j̸=i

Then if q (x) is a monic polynomial of degree larger than 1 which divides p (x), then the
roots of q (x) in K are a subset of {r1 , · · · , rn }. Without loss of generality, suppose these
roots of q (x) are {r1 , · · · , rk } , k ≤ n − 1, since q (x) divides p′ (x) which has degree at most
∏k
n − 1. Then q (x) = i=1 (x − ri ) but this fails to divide p′ (x) as polynomials in K [x] and
so q (x) fails to divide p′ (x) as polynomials in F [x] either. Therefore, q (x) = 1 and so the
two are relatively prime. 
The following lemma says that the usual calculus result holds in case you are looking at
polynomials with coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld of characteristic 0.
Lemma F.8.3 Suppose that F has characteristic 0. Then if f ′ (x) = 0, it follows that f (x)
is a constant.
Proof: Suppose
f (x) = an xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0
Then take the derivative n − 1 times to ﬁnd that an multiplied by a positive integer man
equals 0. Therefore, an = 0 because, by assumption man ̸= 0 if an ̸= 0. Now repeat the
argument with
f1 (x) = an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0
and continue this way to ﬁnd that f (x) = a0 ∈ F. 
Now here is a major result which applies to ﬁelds of characteristic 0.
Theorem F.8.4 If F is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, then every polynomial p (x) , having
coeﬃcients in F is separable.
Proof: It is required to show that the irreducible factors of p (x) have distinct roots in
K a splitting ﬁeld for p (x). So let q (x) be an irreducible monic polynomial. If l (x) is a
monic polynomial of positive degree which divides both q (x) and q ′ (x) , then since q (x) is
irreducible, it must be the case that l (x) = q (x) which forces q (x) to divide q ′ (x) . However,
the degree of q ′ (x) is less than the degree of q (x) so this is impossible. Hence l (x) = 1 and
so q ′ (x) and q (x) are relatively prime which implies that q (x) has distinct roots. 
It follows that the above theory all holds for any ﬁeld of characteristic 0. For example,
if the ﬁeld is Q then everything holds.
Proposition F.8.5 If a ﬁeld F has characteristic p, then p is a prime.
Proof: First note that if n · 1 = 0, if and only if for all a ̸= 0, n · a = 0 also. This just
follows from the distributive law and the deﬁnition of what is meant by n · 1, meaning that
you add 1 to itself n times. Suppose then that there are positive integers, each larger than
1 n, m such that nm · 1 = 0. Then grouping the terms in the sum associated with nm · 1,
it follows that n (m · 1) = 0. If the characteristic of the ﬁeld is nm, this is a contradiction
because then m · 1 ̸= 0 but n times it is, implying that n < nm but n · a = 0 for a nonzero
a. Hence n · 1 = 0 showing that mn is not the characteristic of the ﬁeld after all. 

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

Deﬁnition F.8.6 A ﬁeld F is called perfect if every polynomial p (x) having coeﬃcients in
F is separable.
The above shows that ﬁelds of characteristic 0 are perfect. The above theory about
Galois groups and ﬁxed ﬁelds all works for perfect ﬁelds. What about ﬁelds of characteristic
p where p is a prime? The following interesting lemma has to do with a nonzero a ∈ F
having a pth root in F.
Lemma F.8.7 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic p. Let a ̸= 0 where a ∈ F. Then either
p
xp − a is irreducible or there exists b ∈ F such that xp − a = (x − b) .
Proof: Suppose that xp − a is not irreducible. Then xp − a = g (x) f (x) where the
degree of g (x) , k is less than p and at least as large as 1. Then let b be a root of g (x). Then
bp − a = 0. Therefore,
p
xp − a = xp − bp = (x − b) .
p

That is right. xp − bp = (x − b) just like many beginning calculus students believe. It
happens because of the binomial theorem and the fact that the other terms have a factor of
p. Hence
p
xp − a = (x − b) = g (x) f (x)
p

k

and so g (x) divides (x − b) which requires that g (x) = (x − b) since g (x) has degree k.
It follows, since g (x) is given to have coeﬃcients in F, that bk ∈ F. Also bp ∈ F. Since k, p
are relatively prime, due to the fact that k < p with p prime, there are integers m, n such
that
1 = mk + np
Then from what you mean by raising b to an integer power and the usual rules of exponents
for integer powers,
( )m
n
b = bk (bp ) ∈ F.

So when is a ﬁeld of characteristic p perfect? As observed above, for a ﬁeld of characteristic p,
p
(a + b) = ap + bp .
Also,
p

(ab) = ap bp
It follows that a → ap is a homomorphism. This is also one to one because, as mentioned
above
p
(a − b) = ap − bp
Therefore, if ap = bp , it follows that a = b. Therefore, this homomorphism is also one to
one.
Let Fp be the collection of ap where a ∈ F. Then clearly Fp is a subﬁeld of F because
it is the image of a one to one homomorphism. What follows is the condition for a ﬁeld of
characteristic p to be perfect.
Theorem F.8.8 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic p. Then F is perfect if and only if F = Fp .
Proof: Suppose F = Fp ﬁrst. Let f (x) be an irreducible polynomial over F. By Theorem
F.8.2, if f ′ (x) and f (x) are relatively prime over F then f (x) has no repeated roots. Suppose
then that the two polynomials are not relatively prime. If d (x) divides both f (x) and f ′ (x)
with degree of d (x) ≥ 1. Then, since f (x) is irreducible, it follows that d (x) is a multiple

F.9. PERMUTATIONS

475

of f (x) and so f (x) divides f ′ (x) which is impossible unless f ′ (x) = 0. But if f ′ (x) = 0,
then f (x) must be of the form
a0 + a1 xp + a2 x2p + · · · + an xnp
since if it had some other nonzero term with exponent not a multiple of p then f ′ (x) could
not equal zero since you would have something surviving in the expression for the derivative
after taking out multiples of p which is like
kaxk−1
where a ̸= 0 and k < p. Thus ka ̸= 0. Hence the form of f (x) is as indicated above.
If ak = bpk for some bk ∈ F, then the expression for f (x) is
bp0 + bp1 xp + bp2 x2p + · · · + bpn xnp
(
)p
= b0 + b1 x + bx x2 + · · · + bn xn
because of the fact noted earlier that a → ap is a homomorphism. However, this says that
f (x) is not irreducible after all. It follows that there exists ak such that ak ∈
/ Fp contrary
p
′
to the assumption that F = F . Hence the greatest common divisor of f (x) and f (x) must
be 1.
p
Next consider the other direction. Suppose F ̸= Fp . Then there exists a ∈ F \ F .
p
p
Consider the polynomial x − a. As noted above, its derivative equals 0. Therefore, x − a
and its derivative cannot be relatively prime. In fact, xp − a would divide both. 
Now suppose F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. If n · 1 is never equal to 0 then, since the ﬁeld is ﬁnite,
k · 1 = m · 1, for some k < m. m > k, and (m − k) · 1 = 0 which is a contradiction. Hence
F is a ﬁeld of characteristic p for some prime p, by Proposition F.8.5. The mapping a → ap
was shown to be a homomorphism which is also one to one. Therefore, Fp is a subﬁeld of
F. It follows that it has characteristic q for some q a prime. However, this requires q = p
and so Fp = F. Then the following corollary is obtained from the above theorem.
Corollary F.8.9 If F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld, then F is perfect.
With this information, here is a convenient version of the fundamental theorem of Galois
theory.
Theorem F.8.10 Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of any polynomial p (x) ∈ F [x] where F is
k
either of characteristic 0 or of characteristic p with Fp = F. Let {Li }i=0 be the increasing
sequence of intermediate ﬁelds between F and K. Then each of these is a normal extension
of F and the Galois group G (Lj−1 , F) is a normal subgroup of G (Lj , F). In addition to this,
G (Lj , F) ≃ G (K, F) /G (K, Lj )
where the symbol ≃ indicates the two spaces are isomorphic.

F.9

Permutations

Let {a1 , · · · , an } be a set of distinct elements. Then a permutation of these elements is
usually thought of as a list in a particular order. Thus there are exactly n! permutations of
a set having n distinct elements. With this deﬁnition, here is a simple lemma.
Lemma F.9.1 Every permutation can be obtained from every other permutation by a ﬁnite
number of switches.

476

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

Proof: This is obvious if n = 1 or 2. Suppose then that it is true for sets of n−1 elements.
Take two permutations of {a1 , · · · , an } , P1 , P2 . To get from P1 to P2 using switches, ﬁrst
make a switch to obtain the last element in the list coinciding with the last element of P2 .
By induction, there are switches which will arrange the ﬁrst n − 1 to the right order. 
It is customary to consider permutations in terms of the set In ≡ {1, · · · , n} to be more
speciﬁc. Then one can think of a given permutation as a mapping σ from this set In to
itself which is one to one and onto. In fact, σ (i) ≡ j where j is in the ith position. Often
people write such a σ in the following form
(
)
1 2 ··· n
(6.21)
i1 i2 · · · in
An easy way to understand the above permutation is through the use of matrix multiplicaT
tion by permutation matrices. The above vector (i1 , · · · , in ) is obtained by


1

(
)
 2 
ei1 ei2 · · · ein  . 
(6.22)
 .. 
n
This can be seen right away from looking at a simple example or by using the deﬁnition of
matrix multiplication directly.
Deﬁnition F.9.2 The sign of the permutation (6.21) is deﬁned as the determinant of the
above matrix in (6.22).
In other words, the sign of the permutation
(
1 2 ···
i1 i2 · · ·

n
in

)

equals sgn (i1 , · · · , in ) deﬁned earlier in Lemma 3.3.1.
Note that from the fact that the determinant is well deﬁned and its properties, the sign of
a permutation is 1 if and only if the permutation is produced by an even number of switches
and that the number of switches used to produce a given permutation must be either even
or odd. Of course a switch is a permutation itself and this is called a transposition. Note
also that all these matrices are orthogonal matrices so to take the inverse, it suﬃces to take
a transpose, the inverse also being a permutation matrix.
The resulting group consisting of the permutations of In is called Sn . An important idea
is the notion of a cycle. Let σ be a permutation, a one to one and onto function deﬁned on
In . A cycle is of the form
(
)
k, σ (k) , σ 2 (k) , σ 3 (k) , · · · , σ m−1 (k) , σ m (k) = k.
The last condition must hold for some m because In is ﬁnite. Then a cycle can be considered
as a permutation as follows. Let (i1 , i2 , · · · , im ) be a cycle. Then deﬁne σ by σ (i1 ) =
i2 , σ (i2 ) = i3 , · · · , σ (im ) = i1 , and if k ∈
/ {i1 , i2 , · · · , im } , then σ (k) = k.
Note that if you have two cycles, (i1 , i2 , · · · , im ) , (j1 , j2 , · · · , jm ) which are disjoint in
the sense that
{i1 , i2 , · · · , im } ∩ {j1 , j2 , · · · , jm } = ∅,
then they commute. It is then clear that every permutation can be represented in a unique
way by disjoint cycles. Start with 1 and form the cycle determined by 1. Then start with the

F.9. PERMUTATIONS

477

smallest k ∈ In which was not included and begin a cycle starting with this. Continue this
way. Use the convention that (k) is just the identity. This representation is unique up to
order of the cycles which does not matter because they commute. Note that a transposition
can be written as (a, b).
A cycle can be written as a product of non disjoint transpositions.
(i1 , i2 , · · · , im ) = (im−1 , im ) · · · (i2 , im ) (i1 , im )
Thus if m is odd, the permutation has sign 1 and if m is even, the permutation has sign
−1
−1. Also, it is clear that the inverse of the above permutation is (i1 , i2 , · · · , im )
=
(im , · · · , i2 , i1 ) .
Deﬁnition F.9.3 An is the subgroup of Sn such that for σ ∈ An , σ is the product of an
even number of transpositions. It is called the alternating group.
The following important result is useful in describing An .
Proposition F.9.4 Let n ≥ 3. Then every permutation in An is the product of 3 cycles
and the identity.
Proof: In case n = 3, you can list all of the permutations in An
(
) (
) (
)
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
,
,
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
In terms of cycles, these are
(1, 2, 3) , (1, 3, 2)
You can easily check that they are inverses of each other. Now suppose n ≥ 4. The
permutations in An are deﬁned as the product of an even number of transpositions. There
are two cases. The ﬁrst case is where you have two transpositions which share a number,
(a, c) (c, b) = (a, c, b)
Thus when they share a number, the product is just a 3 cycle. Next suppose you have the
product of two transpositions which are disjoint. This can happen because n ≥ 4. First note
that
(a, b) = (c, b) (b, a, c) = (c, b, a) (c, a)
Therefore,
(a, b) (c, d)

= (c, b, a) (c, a) (a, d) (d, c, a)
= (c, b, a) (c, a, d) (d, c, a)

and so every product of disjoint transpositions is the product of 3 cycles. 
Lemma F.9.5 If n ≥ 5, then if B is a normal subgroup of An , and B is not the identity,
then B must contain a 3 cycle.
Proof: Let α be the permutation in B which is “closest” to the identity without being
the identity. That is, out of all permutations which are not the identity, this is one which
has the most ﬁxed points or equivalently moves the fewest numbers. Then α is the product
of disjoint cycles. Suppose that the longest cycle is the ﬁrst one and it has at least four
numbers. Thus
α = (i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 , · · · , m) γ 1 · · · γ p

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

Since B is normal,
α1 ≡ (i3 , i2 , i1 ) (i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 , · · · , m) (i1 , i2 , i3 ) γ 1 · · · γ p ∈ Am
Then consider α1 α−1 =
(i3 , i2 , i1 ) (i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 , · · · , m) (i1 , i2 , i3 ) (m, · · · i4 , i3 , i2 , i1 )
Then for this permutation, i1 → i3 , i2 → i2 , i3 → i4 , i4 → i1 . The other numbers not in
{i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 } are ﬁxed, and in addition i2 is ﬁxed which did not happen with α. Therefore,
this new permutation moves only 3 numbers. Since it is assumed that m ≥ 4, this is a
contradiction to α ﬁxing the most points. It follows that
α = (i1 , i2 , i3 ) γ 1 · · · γ p

(6.23)

α = (i1 , i2 ) γ 1 · · · γ p

(6.24)

or else
In the ﬁrst case, say γ 1 = (i4 , i5 , · · · ) . Multiply as follows α1 =
(i4 , i2 , i1 ) (i1 , i2 , i3 ) (i4 , i5 , · · · ) γ 2 · · · γ p (i1 , i2 , i4 ) ∈ B
Then form α1 α−1 ∈ B given by
−1
(i4 , i2 , i1 ) (i1 , i2 , i3 ) (i4 , i5 , · · · ) γ 2 · · · γ p (i1 , i2 , i4 ) γ −1
p · · · γ 1 (i3 , i2 , i1 )

= (i4 , i2 , i1 ) (i1 , i2 , i3 ) (i4 , i5 , · · · ) (i1 , i2 , i4 ) (· · · , i5 , i4 ) (i3 , i2 , i1 )
Then i1 → i4 , i2 → i3 , i3 → i5 , i4 → i2 , i5 → i1 and other numbers are ﬁxed. Thus α1 α−1
moves 5 points. However, α moves more than 5 if γ i is not the identity for any i ≥ 2. It
follows that
α = (i1 , i2 , i3 ) γ 1
and γ 1 can only be a transposition. However, this cannot happen because then the above
α would not even be in An . Therefore, γ 1 = ι and so
α = (i1 , i2 , i3 )
Thus in this case, B contains a 3 cycle.
Now consider case (6.24). None of the γ i can be a cycle of length more than 4 since
the above argument would eliminate this possibility. If any has length 3 then the above
argument implies that α equals this 3 cycle. It follows that each γ i must be a 2 cycle. Say
α = (i1 , i2 ) (i3 , i4 ) γ 2 · · · γ p
Thus it moves at least four numbers, greater than four if any of γ i for i ≥ 2 is not the
identity. As before, α1 ≡

Then i1 → i3 , i2 → i4 , i3 → i1 , i4 → i3 so this moves exactly four numbers. Therefore, none
of the γ i is diﬀerent than the identity for i ≥ 2. It follows that
α = (i1 , i2 ) (i3 , i4 )

(6.25)

and α moves exactly four numbers. Then since B is normal, α1 ≡
(i5 , i4 , i3 ) (i1 , i2 ) (i3 , i4 ) (i3 , i4 , i5 ) ∈ B
Then α1 α−1 =

(i5 , i4 , i3 ) (i1 , i2 ) (i3 , i4 ) (i3 , i4 , i5 ) (i3 , i4 ) (i1 , i2 ) ∈ B

Then i1 → i1 , i2 → i2 , i3 → i4 , i4 → i5 , i5 → i3 . Thus this permutation moves only three
numbers and so α cannot be of the form given in (6.25). It follows that case (6.24) does not
occur. 
Deﬁnition F.9.6 A group G is said to be simple if its only normal subgroups are itself and
the identity.
The following major result is due to Galois [17].
Proposition F.9.7 Let n ≥ 5. Then An is simple.
Proof: From Lemma F.9.5, if B is a normal subgroup of An , B ̸= {ι} , then it contains
a 3 cycle α = (i1 , i2 , i3 ),
(
)
i1 i2 i3
i2 i3 i1
Now let (j1 , j2 , j3 ) be another 3 cycle.
(

Let σ be a permutation which satisﬁes
σ (ik ) = jk
Then
σασ −1 (j1 ) =

σα (i1 ) = σ (i2 ) = j2

σασ −1 (j2 ) =
σασ −1 (j3 ) =

σα (i2 ) = σ (i3 ) = j3
σα (i3 ) = σ (i1 ) = j1

while σασ −1 leaves all other numbers ﬁxed. Thus σασ −1 is the given 3 cycle. It follows that
B contains every 3 cycle. By Proposition F.9.4, this implies B = An . The only problem is
that it is not know whether σ is in An . This is where n ≥ 5 is used. You can modify σ on
two numbers not equal to any of the {i1 , i2 , i3 } by multiplying by a transposition so that
the possibly modiﬁed σ is expressed as an even number of transpositions. 

Solvable Groups

Recall the fundamental theorem of Galois theory which established a correspondence between the normal subgroups of G (K, F) and normal ﬁeld extensions. Also recall that if H
is one of these normal subgroups, then there was an isomorphism between G (KH , F) and
the quotient group G (K, F) /H. The general idea of a solvable group is given next.

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

Deﬁnition F.10.1 A group G is solvable if there exists a decreasing sequence of subgroups
m
{Hi }i=0 such that H i is a normal subgroup of H (i−1) ,
G = H0 ⊇ H1 ⊇ · · · ⊇ Hm = {ι} ,
and each quotient group Hi−1 /Hi is Abelian. That is, for [a] , [b] ∈ Hi−1 /Hi ,
[ab] = [a] [b] = [b] [a] = [ba]
Note that if G is an Abelian group, then it is automatically solvable. In fact you can
just consider H0 = G, H1 = {ι}. In this case H0 /H1 is just the group G which is Abelian.
There is another idea which helps in understanding whether a group is solvable. It
involves the commutator subgroup. This is a very good idea because this subgroup is
deﬁned in terms of the group G.
Deﬁnition F.10.2 Let a, b ∈ G a group. Then the commutator is
aba−1 b−1
The commutator subgroup, denoted by G′ , is the smallest subgroup which contains all the
commutators.
The nice thing about the commutator subgroup is that it is a normal subgroup. There
are also many other amazing properties.
Theorem F.10.3 Let G be a group and let G′ be the commutator subgroup. Then G′ is a
normal subgroup. Also the quotient group G/G′ is Abelian. If H is any normal subgroup of
G such that G/H is Abelian, then H ⊇ G′ . If G′ = {ι} , then G must be Abelian.
Proof: The elements of G′ are just ﬁnite products of things like aba−1 b−1 . Note that
the inverse of something like this is also one of these.
( −1 −1 )−1
aba b
= bab−1 a−1 .
Thus the collection of ﬁnite products is indeed a subgroup. Now consider h ∈ G. Then
haba−1 b−1 h−1 = hah−1 hbh−1 ha−1 h−1 hb−1 h−1
(
)−1 (
)−1
= hah−1 hbh−1 hah−1
hbh−1
which is another one of those commutators. Thus for c a commutator and h ∈ G,
hch−1 = c1
another commutator. If you have a product of commutators c1 c2 · · · cm , then
hc1 c2 · · · cm h−1 =

m
∏

hci h−1 =

i=1

m
∏

di ∈ G′

i=1

′

where the di are each commutators. Hence G is a normal subgroup.
Consider now the quotient group. Is [g] [h] = [h] [g]? In other words, is [gh] = [hg]?
−1
In other words, is gh (hg) = ghg −1 h−1 ∈ G′ ? Of course. This is a commutator and Ǵ′
consists of products of these things. Thus the quotient group is Abelian.
Now let H be a normal subgroup of G such that G/H is Abelian. Then if g, h ∈ G,
[gh] = [hg] , gh (hg)

= ghg −1 h−1 ∈ H

Thus every commutator is in H and so H ⊇ G.
The last assertion is obvious because G/ {ι} is isomorphic to G. Also, to say that
G′ = {ι} is to say that
aba−1 b−1 = ι
which implies that ab = ba. 
Let G be a group and let G′ be its commutator subgroup. Then the commutator subgroup of G′ is G′′ and so forth. To save on notation, denote by G(k) the k th commutator
subgroup. Thus you have the sequence
G(0) ⊇ G(1) ⊇ G(2) ⊇ G(3) · · ·
each G(i) being a normal subgroup of G(i−1) although it is possible that G(i) is not a normal
subgroup of G. Then there is a useful criterion for a group to be solvable.
Theorem F.10.4 Let G be a group. It is solvable if and only if G(k) = {ι} for some k.
Proof: If G(k) = {ι} then G is clearly solvable because of Theorem F.10.3. The sequence
of commutator subgroups provides the necessary sequence of subgroups.
Next suppose that you have
G = H0 ⊇ H1 ⊇ · · · ⊇ Hm = {ι}
where each is normal in the preceding and the quotient groups are Abelian. Then from
Theorem F.10.3, G(1) ⊆ H1 . Thus H1′ ⊇ G(2) . But also, from Theorem F.10.3, since H1 /H2
is Abelian,
H2 ⊇ H1′ ⊇ G(2) .
Continuing this way G(k) = {ι} for some k ≤ m. 
Theorem F.10.5 If G is a solvable group and if H is a homomorphic image of G, then H
is also solvable.
Proof: By the above theorem, it suﬃces to show that H (k) = {ι} for some k. Let
′
f be the homomorphism. Then (H ′ = f (G
). To see this, consider (a commutator
of
)
)
−1
−1
−1 −1
(1)
(1)
H, f (a) f (b) f (a) f (b)
= f aba b
. It follows that H
= f G
. Now continue this way, letting G(1) play the role of G and H (1) the role of H. Thus, since G is
solvable, some G(k) = {ι} and so H (k) = {ι} also. 
Now as an important example, of a group which is not solvable, here is a theorem.
Theorem F.10.6 For n ≥ 5, Sn is not solvable.
Proof: It is clear that An is a normal subgroup of Sn because if σ is a permutation, then
it has the same sign as σ −1 . Thus σασ −1 ∈ An if α ∈ An . If H is a normal subgroup of Sn ,
for which Sn /H is Abelian, then H contains the commutator G′ . However, ασα−1 σ −1 ∈ An
obviously so An ⊇ Sn′ . By Proposition F.9.7, this forces Sn′ = An . So what is Sn′′ ? If it is
(k)
Sn , then Sn ̸= {ι} for any k and it follows that Sn is not solvable. If Sn′′ = {ι} , the only
other possibility, then An / {ι} is Abelian and so An is Abelian, but this is obviously false
because the cycles (1, 2, 3) , (2, 1, 4) are both in An . However, (1, 2, 3) (2, 1, 4) is

FIELDS AND FIELD EXTENSIONS

Solvability By Radicals

First of all, there exists a ﬁeld which has all the nth roots of 1. You could simply deﬁne it
to be the smallest sub ﬁeld of C such that it contains these roots. You could also enlarge
it by including some other numbers. For example, you could include Q. Observe that if
ξ ≡ ei2π/n , then ξ n = 1 but ξ k ̸= 1 if k < n and that if k < l < n, ξ k ̸= ξ l . Such a ﬁeld
has characteristic 0 because for m an integer, m · 1 ̸= 0. The following is from Herstein [13].
This is the kind of ﬁeld considered here.
Lemma F.11.1 Suppose a ﬁeld F has all the nth roots of 1 for a particular n and suppose
there exists ξ such that the nth roots of 1 are of the form ξ k for k = 1, · · · , n, the ξ k being
distinct. Let a ∈ F be nonzero. Let K denote the splitting ﬁeld of xn − a over F, thus K is
a normal extension of F. Then K = F [u] where u is any root of xn − a. The Galois group
G (K, F) is Abelian.
Proof: Let u be a root of xn − a and let K equal F [u] . Then let ξ be the nth root of
unity mentioned. Then
(
)n
k
ξ k u = (ξ n ) un = a
{
}
and so each ξ k u is a root of xn − a and these are distinct. It follows that u, ξu, · · · , ξ n−1 u
are the roots of xn − a and all are in F [u] . Thus F [u] = K. Let σ ∈ G (K, F) and observe
that since σ ﬁxes F,
((
)n
) ( (
))n
0 = σ ξk u − a = σ ξk u
−a
It follows that σ maps roots of xn − a to roots of xn − a. Therefore, if σ, α are two elements
of G (K, F) , there exist i, j each no larger than n − 1 such that
σ (u) = ξ i u, α (u) = ξ j u
A typical thing in F [u] is p (u) where p (x) ∈ F [x]. Then
(
)
(
)
σα (p (u)) = p ξ j ξ i u = p ξ i+j u
(
)
(
)
ασ (p (u)) = p ξ i ξ j u = p ξ i+j u
Therefore, G (K, F) is Abelian. 
Deﬁnition F.11.2 For F a ﬁeld, a polynomial p (x) ∈ F [x] is solvable by radicals over
F ≡ F0 if there is a sequence of ﬁelds F1 = F [a1 ] , F2 = F1 [a2 ] , · · · , Fk = Fk−1 [ak ] such that
for each i ≥ 1, aki i ∈ Fi−1 and Fk contains a splitting ﬁeld K for p (x) over F.
Lemma F.11.3 In the above deﬁnition, you can assume that Fk is a normal extension of
F.
Proof: First note that Fk = F [a1 , a2 , · · · , ak ]. Let G be the normal extension of Fk .
By Lemma F.7.3, G is the smallest ﬁeld which contains the conjugate ﬁelds
[
]
η j (F [a1 , a2 , · · · , ak ]) = F η j a1 , η j a2 , · · · , η j ak
( )
(
)ki
for {η 1 , η 2 , · · · , η m } = G (Fk , F). Also, η j ai
= η j aki i ∈ η j Fi−1 , η j F = F. Then
G = F [η 1 (a1 ) , η 1 (a2 ) , · · · , η 1 (ak ) , η 2 (a1 ) , η 2 (a2 ) , · · · , η 2 (ak ) · · · ]
and this is a splitting ﬁeld so is a normal extension. Thus G could be the new Fk with
respect to a longer sequence but would now be a splitting ﬁeld. 

At this point, it is a good idea to recall the big fundamental theorem mentioned above
which gives the correspondence between normal subgroups and normal ﬁeld extensions since
it is about to be used again.
F ≡ F0
G (F, F) = {ι}

⊆ G (F1 , F) ⊆ G (F2 , F)

Theorem F.11.4 Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of any polynomial p (x) ∈ F [x] where F is either
k
of characteristic 0 or of characteristic p with Fp = F. Let {Fi }i=0 be the increasing sequence
of intermediate ﬁelds between F and K. Then each of these is a normal extension of F and
the Galois group G (Fj−1 , F) is a normal subgroup of G (Fj , F). In addition to this,
G (Fj , F) ≃ G (K, F) /G (K, Fj )
where the symbol ≃ indicates the two spaces are isomorphic.
Theorem F.11.5 Let f (x) be a polynomial in F [x] where F is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0
which contains all nth roots of unity for each n ∈ N. Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of f (x) . Then
if f (x) is solvable by radicals over F, then the Galois group G (K, F) is a solvable group.
Proof: Using the deﬁnition given above for f (x) to be solvable by radicals, there is a
sequence of ﬁelds
F0 = F ⊆ F1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Fk , K ⊆ Fk ,
where Fi = Fi−1 [ai ], aki i ∈ Fi−1 , and each ﬁeld extension is a normal extension of the preceding one. You can assume that Fk is the splitting ﬁeld of a polynomial having coeﬃcients
in Fj−1 . This follows from the Lemma F.11.3 above. Then starting the hypotheses of the
theorem at Fj−1 rather than at F, it follows from Theorem F.11.4 that
G (Fj , Fj−1 ) ≃ G (Fk , Fj−1 ) /G (Fk , Fj )
By Lemma F.11.1, the Galois group G (Fj , Fj−1 ) is Abelian and so this requires that
G (Fk , F) is a solvable group.
Of course K is a normal ﬁeld extension of F because it is a splitting ﬁeld. By Theorem F.10.5, G (Fk , K) is a normal subgroup of G (Fk , F). Also G (K, F) is isomorphic to
G (Fk , F) /G (Fk , K) and so G (K, F) is a homomorphic image of G (Fk , F) which is solvable. Here is why this last assertion is so. Deﬁne θ : G (Fk , F) /G (Fk , K) → G (K, F) by
θ [σ] ≡ σ|K . Then this is clearly a homomorphism if it is well deﬁned. If [σ] = [α] this
means σα−1 ∈ G (Fk , K) and so σα−1 ﬁxes everything in K so that θ is indeed well deﬁned.
Therefore, by Theorem F.10.5, G (K, F) must also be solvable. 
Now this result implies that you can’t solve the general polynomial equation of degree 5
or more by radicals. Let {a1 , a2 , · · · , an } ⊆ G where G is some ﬁeld which contains a ﬁeld
F0 . Let
F ≡ F0 (a1 , a2 , · · · , an )
the ﬁeld of all rational functions in the numbers a1 , a2 , · · · , an . I am using this notation
because I don’t want to assume the ai are algebraic over F. Now consider the equation
p (t) = tn − a1 tn−1 + a2 tn−2 + · · · ± an .
and suppose that p (t) has distinct roots, none of them in F. Let K be a splitting ﬁeld for
p (t) over F so that

Then it follows that
ai = si (r1 , · · · , rn )
where the si are the elementary symmetric functions deﬁned in Deﬁnition F.1.2. For σ ∈
G (K, F) you can deﬁne σ̄ ∈ Sn by the rule
σ̄ (k) ≡ j where σ (rk ) = rj .
Recall that the automorphisms of G (K, F) take roots of p (t) to roots of p (t). This mapping
σ → σ̄ is onto, a homomorphism, and one to one because the symmetric functions si
are unchanged when the roots are permuted. Thus a rational function in s1 , s2 , · · · , sn is
unaﬀected when the roots rk are permuted. It follows that G (K, F) cannot be solvable if
n ≥ 5 because Sn is not solvable.

For example, consider 3x5 − 25x3 + 45x + 1 or equivalently x5 − 25
3 x + 15x + 3 . It clearly
has no rational roots and a graph will show it has 5 real roots. Let F be the smallest ﬁeld
contained in C which contains the coeﬃcients of the polynomial and all roots of unity. Then
probably none of these roots are in F and they are all distinct. In fact, it appears that the
real numbers which are in F are rational. Therefore, from the above, none of the roots are
solvable by radicals involving numbers from F. Thus none are solvable by radicals using
numbers from the smallest ﬁeld containing the coeﬃcients either.

41 Obviously not. Because of the Coriolis force experienced by the ﬁred bullet which is not experienced
by the dropped bullet, it will not be as simple as
in the physics books. For example, if the bullet is
ﬁred East, then y ′ sin ϕ > 0 and will contribute to
a force acting on the bullet which has been ﬁred
which will cause it to hit the ground faster than the
one dropped. Of course at the North pole or the
South pole, things should be closer to what is expected in the physics books because there sin ϕ = 0.
Also, if you ﬁre it North or South, there seems to
be no extra force because y ′ = 0.

9 From the Cayley Hamilton theorem,An +an−1 An−1 +
· · · + a1 A + a0 I = 0. Also the characteristic polynomial is det (tI − A) and the constant term is
n

(−1) det (A) . Thus a0 ̸= 0 if and only if det (A) ̸=
0 if and only if A−1 has an inverse. Thus if A−1
exists, it follows that
(
)
a0 I = − An + an−1 An−1 + · · · + a1 A
(
)
= A −An−1 − an−1 An−2 − · · · − a1 I and also
(

a0 I = −An−1 − an−1 An−2 − · · · − a1 I A Therefore, the inverse is

11 Say the characteristic polynomial is q (t) which is of
degree 3. Then if n ≥ 3, tn = q (t) l (t) + r (t) where
the degree of r (t) is either less than 3 or it equals
zero. Thus An = q (A) l (A) + r (A) = r (A) and
so all the terms An for n ≥ 3 can be replaced with
some r (A) where the degree of r (t) is no more than
2. Thus, assuming there are no convergence
issues,
∑2
the inﬁnite sum must be of the form k=0 bk Ak .

10 It is because you cannot have more than min (m, n)
nonzero rows in the row reduced echelon form. Recall that the number of pivot columns is the same

31 If A has an inverse, then it is one to one. Hence the

the kernel or null space of some matrix? Prove or

Consider the matrix

30 This is easy to see when you consider that P ij is
its own inverse and that P ij multiplied on the right
switches the ith and j th columns. Thus you switch
the columns and then you switch the rows. This has

This is not defective.
25 First consider the eigenvalue λ = 1. Then you have
ax2 = 0, bx3 = 0. If neither a nor b = 0 then
λ = 1 would be a defective eigenvalue and the matrix would be defective. If a = 0, then the dimension of the eigenspace is clearly 2 and so the matrix would be nondefective. If b = 0 but a ̸= 0,
then you would have a defective matrix because the
eigenspace would have dimension less than 2. If
c ̸= 0, then the matrix is defective. If c = 0 and
a = 0, then it is non defective. Basically, if a, c ̸= 0,
then the matrix is defective.
27 A (x + iy) = (a + ib) (x + iy) . Now just take complex conjugates of both sides.
29 Let A be skew symmetric. Then if x is an eigenvector for λ,
λxT x̄ = xT AT x̄ = −xT Ax̄ = −xT x̄λ̄

15 You can see these are not similar by noticing that
the second has an eigenspace of dimension equal to
1 so it is not similar to any diagonal matrix which
is what the ﬁrst one is.
19 This is because the general solution is yp + y where
Ayp = b and Ay = 0. Now A0 = 0 and so the solution is unique precisely when this is the only solution y to Ay = 0.

get 0 > λ |x| + λ̄ |x| = Re (λ) |x|
19 If Ax = λx, then you can take the norm of both
sides and conclude that |λ| = 1. It follows that the
eigenvalues of A are eiθ , e−iθ and another one which
has magnitude 1 and is real. This can only be 1 or
−1. Since the determinant is given to be 1, it follows
that it is 1. Therefore, there exists an eigenvector
for the eigenvalue 1.
