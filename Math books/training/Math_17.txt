Preface to the Third Edition

y goal in writing this book has been to create a very inexpensive
high-quality textbook. The book can be downloaded from my web
page in PDF format for free, and the print version costs considerably less
than comparable traditional textbooks.
In this third edition, Chapter 3 (on counting) has been expanded, and a
new chapter on calculus proofs has been added. New examples and exercises
have been added throughout. My decisions regarding revisions have been
guided by both the Amazon reviews and emails from readers, and I am
grateful for all comments.
I have taken pains to ensure that the third edition is compatible with the
second. Exercises have not been reordered, although some have been edited
for clarity and some new ones have been appended. (The one exception
is that Chapter 3’s reorganization shifted some exercises.) The chapter
sequencing is identical between editions, with one exception: The final
chapter on cardinality has become Chapter 14 in order to make way for the
new Chapter 13 on calculus proofs. There has been a slight renumbering of
the sections within chapters 10 and 11, but the numbering of the exercises
within the sections is unchanged.
This core of this book is an expansion and refinement of lecture notes I
developed while teaching proofs courses over the past 18 years at Virginia
Commonwealth University (a large state university) and Randolph-Macon
College (a small liberal arts college). I found the needs of these two audiences
to be nearly identical, and I wrote this book for them. But I am mindful of a
larger audience. I believe this book is suitable for almost any undergraduate
mathematics program.

Introduction

T

his is a book about how to prove theorems.

Until this point in your education, mathematics has probably been
presented as a primarily computational discipline. You have learned to
solve equations, compute derivatives and integrals, multiply matrices and
find determinants; and you have seen how these things can answer practical
questions about the real world. In this setting your primary goal in using
mathematics has been to compute answers.
But there is another side of mathematics that is more theoretical than
computational. Here the primary goal is to understand mathematical
structures, to prove mathematical statements, and even to invent or discover
new mathematical theorems and theories. The mathematical techniques
and procedures that you have learned and used up until now are founded
on this theoretical side of mathematics. For example, in computing the area
under a curve, you use the fundamental theorem of calculus. It is because
this theorem is true that your answer is correct. However, in learning
calculus you were probably far more concerned with how that theorem could
be applied than in understanding why it is true. But how do we know it is
true? How can we convince ourselves or others of its validity? Questions of
this nature belong to the theoretical realm of mathematics. This book is an
introduction to that realm.
This book will initiate you into an esoteric world. You will learn and
apply the methods of thought that mathematicians use to verify theorems,
explore mathematical truth and create new mathematical theories. This
will prepare you for advanced mathematics courses, for you will be better
able to understand proofs, write your own proofs and think critically and
inquisitively about mathematics.
The book is organized into four parts, as outlined below.

ix
PART I Fundamentals
• Chapter 1: Sets
• Chapter 2: Logic
• Chapter 3: Counting
Chapters 1 and 2 lay out the language and conventions used in all advanced
mathematics. Sets are fundamental because every mathematical structure,
object, or entity can be described as a set. Logic is fundamental because it
allows us to understand the meanings of statements, to deduce facts about
mathematical structures and to uncover further structures. All subsequent
chapters build on these first two chapters. Chapter 3 is included partly
because its topics are central to many branches of mathematics, but also
because it is a source of many examples and exercises that occur throughout
the book. (However, the course instructor may choose to omit Chapter 3.)
PART II Proving Conditional Statements
• Chapter 4: Direct Proof
• Chapter 5: Contrapositive Proof
• Chapter 6: Proof by Contradiction
Chapters 4 through 6 are concerned with three main techniques used for
proving theorems that have the “conditional” form “If P , then Q.”
PART III More on Proof
• Chapter 7: Proving Non-Conditional Statements
• Chapter 8: Proofs Involving Sets
• Chapter 9: Disproof
• Chapter 10: Mathematical Induction
These chapters deal with useful variations, embellishments and consequences of the proof techniques introduced in Chapters 4 through 6.
PART IV Relations, Functions and Cardinality
• Chapter 11: Relations
• Chapter 12: Functions
• Chapter 13: Proofs in Calculus
• Chapter 14: Cardinality of Sets
These final chapters are mainly concerned with the idea of functions, which
are central to all of mathematics. Upon mastering this material you will be
ready for advanced mathematics courses such as abstract algebra, analysis,
topology, combinatorics and theory of computation.

The chapters are organized as in the following dependency tree. The
left-hand column forms the core of the book; each chapter in this column
uses material from all chapters above it. Chapters 3 and 13 may be omitted
without loss of continuity. But the material in Chapter 3 is a great source
of exercises, and the reader who omits it should ignore the later exercises
that draw from it. Chapter 10, on induction, can also be omitted with no
break in continuity. However, induction is a topic that most proof courses
will include.

CHAPTER 1

Sets

ll of mathematics can be described with sets. This becomes more and
more apparent the deeper into mathematics you go. It will be apparent
in most of your upper level courses, and certainly in this course. The theory
of sets is a language that is perfectly suited to describing and explaining all
types of mathematical structures.

A

1.1 Introduction to Sets
A set is a collection of things. The things are called elements of the set. We
are mainly concerned with sets whose elements are mathematical entities,
such as numbers, points, functions, etc.
A set is often expressed by listing its elements between commas, enclosed
©
ª
by braces. For example, the collection 2, 4, 6, 8 is a set which has four
elements, the numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8. Some sets have infinitely many elements.
For example, consider the collection of all integers,
©

ª
. . . , −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . .

Here the dots indicate a pattern of numbers that continues forever in both
the positive and negative directions. A set is called an infinite set if it has
infinitely many elements; otherwise it is called a finite set.
Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. Thus
©
ª ©
ª
2, 4, 6, 8 = 4, 2, 8, 6 because even though they are listed in a different order,
©
ª ©
ª
the elements are identical; but 2, 4, 6, 8 6= 2, 4, 6, 7 . Also
©

ª ©
ª
. . . − 4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . = 0, −1, 1, −2, 2, −3, 3, −4, 4, . . . .

We often let uppercase letters stand for sets. In discussing the set
ª
©
ª
©
ª
2, 4, 6, 8 we might declare A = 2, 4, 6, 8 and then use A to stand for 2, 4, 6, 8 .
To express that 2 is an element of the set A , we write 2 ∈ A, and read this as
“2 is an element of A ,” or “2 is in A ,” or just “2 in A .” We also have 4 ∈ A , 6 ∈ A
and 8 ∈ A , but 5 ∉ A . We read this last expression as “5 is not an element of
A ,” or “5 not in A .” Expressions like 6, 2 ∈ A or 2, 4, 8 ∈ A are used to indicate
that several things are in a set.

Sets

Some sets are so significant that we reserve special symbols for them.
The set of natural numbers (i.e., the positive whole numbers) is denoted
by N, that is,
©
ª
N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . . .

The set of integers
©
ª
Z = . . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .

is another fundamental set. The symbol R stands for the set of all real
numbers, a set that is undoubtedly familiar to you from calculus. Other
special sets will be listed later in this section.
©
ª
Sets need not have just numbers as elements. The set B = T, F consists
of two letters, perhaps representing the values “true” and “false.” The set
©
ª
C = a, e, i, o, u consists of the lowercase vowels in the English alphabet.
©
ª
The set D = (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1) has as elements the four corner points
of a square on the x- y coordinate plane. Thus (0, 0) ∈ D , (1, 0) ∈ D , etc.,
but (1, 2) ∉ D (for instance). It is even possible for a set to have other sets
© ©
ª©
ªª
as elements. Consider E = 1, 2, 3 , 2, 4 , which has three elements: the
©
ª
©
ª
©
ª
number 1, the set 2, 3 and the set 2, 4 . Thus 1 ∈ E and 2, 3 ∈ E and
©
ª
2, 4 ∈ E . But note that 2 ∉ E , 3 ∉ E and 4 ∉ E .
©£ ¤ £ ¤ £ ¤ª
Consider the set M = 00 00 , 10 01 , 11 01 of three two-by-two matrices. We
£ ¤
£ ¤
have 00 00 ∈ M , but 10 11 ∉ M . Letters can serve as symbols denoting a set’s
£0 0¤
£ ¤
£ ¤
©
ª
elements: If a = 0 0 , b = 10 01 and c = 11 01 , then M = a, b, c .
If X is a finite set, its cardinality or size is the number of elements
it has, and this number is denoted as | X |. Thus for the sets above, | A | = 4,
|B| = 2, |C | = 5, |D | = 4, |E | = 3 and | M | = 3.
There is a special set that, although small, plays a big role. The empty
©ª
©ª
set is the set that has no elements. We denote it as ;, so ; = . Whenever
©ª
you see the symbol ;, it stands for . Observe that |;| = 0. The empty set
is the only set whose cardinality is zero.
© ª
Be careful in writing the empty set. Don’t write ; when you mean ;.
© ª
These sets can’t be equal because ; contains nothing while ; contains
one thing, namely the empty set. If this is confusing, think of a set as a
©
ª
box with things in it, so, for example, 2, 4, 6, 8 is a “box” containing four
©ª
© ª
numbers. The empty set ; = is an empty box. By contrast, ; is a box
with an empty box inside it. Obviously, there’s a difference: An empty box
© ª
is not the same as a box with
an
empty
box
inside
it.
Thus
; 6= ; . (You
¯© ª¯
© ª
might also note |;| = 0 and ¯ ; ¯ = 1 as additional evidence that ; 6= ; .)

© ª ©© ªªª

This box analogy can help us think about sets. The set F = ;, ; , ;
may look strange but it is really very simple. Think of it as a box containing
three things: an empty box, a box containing an empty box, and a box
©
ª
containing a box containing an empty box. Thus |F | = 3. The set G = N, Z
is a box containing two boxes, the box of natural numbers and the box of
integers. Thus |G | = 2.
A special notation called set-builder notation is used to describe sets
that are too big or complex to list between braces. Consider the infinite set
©
ª
of even integers E = . . . , −6, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, . . . . In set-builder notation this
set is written as
©
ª
E = 2n : n ∈ Z .
We read the first brace as “the set of all things of form,” and the colon as
©
ª
“such that.” So the expression E = 2n : n ∈ Z reads as “E equals the set of
all things of form 2n, such that n is an element of Z.” The idea is that E
consists of all possible values of 2n, where n takes on all values in Z.
In general, a set X written with set-builder notation has the syntax
©
ª
X = expression : rule ,

where the elements of X are understood to be all values of “expression” that
are specified by “rule.” For example, above E is the set of all values of the
expression 2n that satisfy the rule n ∈ Z. There can be many ways to express
©
ª ©
ª
the same set. For example, E = 2n : n ∈ Z = n : n is an even integer =
©
ª
n : n = 2k, k ∈ Z . Another common way of writing it is
©
ª
E = n ∈ Z : n is even ,

read “E is the set of all n in Z such that n is even.” Some writers use a bar
©
ª
instead of a colon; for example, E = n ∈ Z | n is even . We use the colon.
Example 1.1 Here are some further illustrations of set-builder notation.

Items 6–8 above highlight a conflict of notation that we must always
be alert to. The expression | X | means absolute value if X is a number
and cardinality if X is a set. The distinction should always be clear from
©
ª
context. Consider x ∈ Z : | x| < 4 in Example 1.1 (6) above. Here x ∈ Z, so x
is a number (not a set), and thus the bars in | x| must mean absolute value,
©©
ª©
ª © ªª
not cardinality. On the other hand, suppose A = 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7 and
©
ª
B = X ∈ A : | X | < 3 . The elements of A are sets (not numbers), so the | X | in
©©
ª © ªª
the expression for B must mean cardinality. Therefore B = 1, 2 , 7 .
Example 1.2 Describe the set A = 7a + 3b : a, b ∈ Z .
©

ª

Solution: This set contains all numbers of form 7a + 3b, where a and b
are integers. Each such number 7a + 3b is an integer, so A contains only
integers. But which integers? If n is any integer, then n = 7n + 3(−2n), so
n = 7a + 3b where a = n and b = −2n. Therefore n ∈ A . We’ve now shown that
A contains only integers, and also that every integer is an element of A .
Consequently A = Z.
We close this section with a summary of special sets. These are sets
that are so common that they are given special names and symbols.

Notice that Q is the set of all numbers in R that can be expressed as a

fraction of two integers. You may be aware that Q 6= R, as 2 ∉ Q but 2 ∈ R.
(If not, this point will be addressed in Chapter 6.)
In calculus you encountered intervals on the number line. Like R, these
too are infinite sets of numbers. Any two numbers a, b ∈ R with a < b give
rise to various intervals. Graphically, they are represented by a darkened
segment on the number line between a and b. A solid circle at an endpoint
indicates that that number is included in the interval. A hollow circle
indicates a point that is not included in the interval.

Each of these intervals is an infinite set containing infinitely many
numbers as elements. For example, though its length is short, the interval
(0.1, 0.2) contains infinitely many numbers, that is, all numbers between
0.1 and 0.2. It is an unfortunate notational accident that (a, b) can denote
both an open interval on the line and a point on the plane. The difference
is usually clear from context. In the next section we will see yet another
meaning of (a, b).

1.2 The Cartesian Product
Given two sets A and B, it is possible to “multiply” them to produce a new
set denoted as A × B. This operation is called the Cartesian product. To
understand it, we must first understand the idea of an ordered pair.
Definition 1.1 An ordered pair is a list (x, y) of two things x and y,
enclosed in parentheses and separated by a comma.
For example, (2, 4) is an ordered pair, as is (4, 2). These ordered pairs are
different because even though they have the same things in them, the order
is different. We write (2, 4) 6= (4, 2). Right away you can see that ordered pairs
can be used to describe points on the plane, as was done in calculus, but
they are not limited to just that. The things in an ordered pair don’t have
to be numbers. You can have ordered pairs of letters, such as (`, m), ordered
¡©
ª©
ª¢
pairs of sets such as 2, 5 , 3, 2 , even ordered pairs of ordered pairs like
¡
¢
¡ ©
ª¢ ¡
¢
(2, 4), (4, 2) . The following are also ordered pairs: 2, 1, 2, 3 , R, (0, 0) . Any
list of two things enclosed by parentheses is an ordered pair. Now we are
ready to define the Cartesian product.
Definition 1.2 The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is another
©
ª
set, denoted as A × B and defined as A × B = (a, b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B .

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

The Cartesian Product

Thus A × B is a set of ordered pairs of elements from A and B. For
©
ª
©
ª
example, if A = k, `, m and B = q, r , then
©
ª
A × B = (k, q), (k, r), (`, q), (`, r), (m, q), (m, r) .

Figure 1.1 shows how to make a schematic diagram of A × B. Line up the
elements of A horizontally and line up the elements of B vertically, as if
A and B form an x- and y-axis. Then fill in the ordered pairs so that each
element (x, y) is in the column headed by x and the row headed by y.

For another example, 0, 1 × 2, 1 = (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 1) . If you are a
visual thinker, you may wish to draw a diagram similar to Figure 1.1. The
rectangular array of such diagrams give us the following general fact.
Fact 1.1 If A and B are finite sets, then | A × B| = | A | · |B|.

Example 1.3 Let A = , , , , ,
be the set consisting of the six faces
of a dice. The Cartesian product A × A is diagramed below. By Fact 1.1 (or
by simple counting), | A × A | = 6 · 6 = 36. We might think of A × A as the set
of possible outcomes in rolling a dice two times in a row. Each element of
¡
¢
the product is an ordered pair of form result of 1st roll, result of 2nd roll .
Such constructions are useful in the study of probability.

The set R × R = (x, y) : x, y ∈ R should be very familiar. It can be viewed
as the set of points on the Cartesian plane, as drawn in Figure 1.2(a). The
©
ª
set R × N = (x, y) : x ∈ R, y ∈ N can be regarded as all of the points on the
plane whose second coordinate is a natural number. This is illustrated in
Figure 1.2(b), which shows that R × N looks like infinitely many horizontal
lines at integer heights above the x-axis. The set N × N is the set of all points
on the plane whose coordinates are both natural numbers. It looks like a
grid of dots in the first quadrant, as illustrated in Figure 1.2(c).

It is even possible for one factor of a Cartesian product to be a Cartesian
©
ª
product itself, as in R × (N × Z) = (x, (y, z)) : x ∈ R, (y, z) ∈ N × Z .
We can also define Cartesian products of three or more sets by moving
beyond ordered pairs. An ordered triple is a list (x, y, z). The Cartesian
©
ª
product of the three sets R, N and Z is R × N × Z = (x, y, z) : x ∈ R, y ∈ N, z ∈ Z .
Of course there is no reason to stop with ordered triples. In general,
©
ª
A 1 × A 2 × · · · × A n = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) : x i ∈ A i for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n .

Be mindful of parentheses. There is a slight difference between R × (N × Z)
and R × N × Z. The first is a Cartesian product of two sets; its elements are
ordered pairs (x, (y, z)). The second is a Cartesian product of three sets; its
elements are ordered triples (x, y, z). To be sure, in many situations there is
no harm in blurring the distinction between expressions like (x, (y, z)) and
(x, y, z), but for now we regard them as different.
For any set A and positive integer n, the Cartesian power A n is
©
ª
A n = A × A × · · · × A = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) : x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ∈ A .

In this way, R2 is the familiar Cartesian plane and R3 is three-dimensional
©
ª
space. You can visualize how, if R2 is the plane, then Z2 = (m, n) : m, n ∈ Z
is a grid of points on the plane. Likewise, as R3 is 3-dimensional space,
©
ª
Z3 = (m, n, p) : m, n, p ∈ Z is a grid of points in space.

In other courses you may encounter sets that are very similar to Rn , but
yet have slightly different shades of meaning. Consider, for example, the
set of all two-by-three matrices with entries from R:
M=

©£ u

v w¤
x y z

ª
: u, v, w, x, y, z ∈ R .

This is not really all that different from the set
©
ª
R6 = (u, v, w, x, y, z) : u, v, w, x, y, z ∈ R .

The elements of these sets are merely certain arrangements of six real
numbers. Despite their similarity, we maintain that M 6= R6 , for two-bythree matrices are not the same things as sequences of six numbers.

Example 1.4 Represent the two sides of a coin by the set S = h,t . The
possible outcomes of tossing the coin seven times in a row can be described
with the Cartesian power S 7 . A typical element of S 7 looks like
(h,h,t,h,t,t,t),

meaning a head was tossed first, then
another head, then a tail, then a head
¯ 7¯
¯
¯
followed by three tails. Note that S = 27 = 128, so there are 128 possible
outcomes. If this is not clear, then it will be explained fully in Chapter 3.

1.3 Subsets

It can happen that every element of a set A is an element of another set B.
©
ª
©
ª
For example, each element of A = 0, 2, 4 is also an element of B = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 .
When A and B are related this way we say that A is a subset of B.
Definition 1.3 Suppose A and B are sets. If every element of A is also
an element of B, then we say A is a subset of B, and we denote this as
A ⊆ B. We write A 6⊆ B if A is not a subset of B, that is, if it is not true that
every element of A is also an element of B. Thus A 6⊆ B means that there
is at least one element of A that is not an element of B.
Example 1.5 Be sure you understand why each of the following is true.

This brings us to a significant fact: If B is any set whatsoever, then ; ⊆ B.
To see why this is true, look at the last sentence of Definition 1.3. It says
that ; 6⊆ B would mean that there is at least one element of ; that is not an
element of B. But this cannot be so because ; contains no elements! Thus
it is not the case that ; 6⊆ B, so it must be that ; ⊆ B.
Fact 1.2

The empty set is a subset of all sets, that is, ; ⊆ B for any set B.

Here is another way to look at it. Imagine a subset of B as a thing you
©ª
make by starting with braces , then filling them with selections from B.
©
ª
©ª
For example, to make one particular subset of B = a, b, c , start with ,
©ª
©
ª
select b and c from B and insert them into
to form the subset b, c .
© ª
Alternatively, you could have chosen just a to make a , and so on. But one
©ª
option is to simply select nothing from B. This leaves you with the subset .
©ª
Thus ⊆ B. More often we write it as ; ⊆ B.

Subsets

This idea of “making” a subset can help us list out all the subsets of a
©
ª
given set B. As an example, let B = a, b, c . Let’s list all of its subsets. One
way of approaching this is to make a tree-like structure. Begin with the
©ª
subset , which is shown on the left of Figure 1.3. Considering the element
©ª
©ª
a of B, we have a choice: insert it into , or not. The lines from
point to
©ª
© ª
what we get depending whether or not we insert a, either
or a . Now
move on to the element b of B. For each of the sets just formed we can either
insert or not insert b, and the lines on the diagram point to the resulting
©ª © ª © ª
©
ª
sets , b , a , or a, b . Finally, to each of these sets, we can either insert
c or not insert it, and this gives us, on the far right-hand column, the sets
©ª © ª © ª ©
ª © ª ©
ª ©
ª
©
ª
, c , b , b, c , a , a, c , a, b and a, b, c . These are the eight subsets

of B = a, b, c .

Figure 1.3. A “tree” for listing subsets

We can see from the way this tree branches that if it happened that
© ª
B = a , then B would have just two subsets, those in the second column of
©
ª
the diagram. If it happened that B = a, b , then B would have four subsets,
those in the third column, and so on. At each branching of the tree, the
number of subsets doubles. So in general, if |B| = n, then B has 2n subsets.
Fact 1.3 If a finite set has n elements, then it has 2n subsets.

For a slightly more complex example, consider listing the subsets of
©
©
ªª
©
ª
B = 1, 2, 1, 3 . This B has just three elements: 1, 2 and 1, 3 . At this point
you probably don’t even have to draw a tree to list out B’s subsets. You just
make all the possible selections from B and put them between braces to get

ªª
, 1 , 2 , 1, 3 , 1, 2 , 1, 1, 3 , 2, 1, 3 , 1, 2, 1, 3 .

These are the eight subsets of B. Exercises like this help you identify what
©
ª
is and isn’t a subset. You know immediately that a set such as 1, 3 is not a
©ª
subset of B because it can’t be made by inserting elements from B into ,
as the 3 is not an element of B and thus is not a valid selection. Notice that
©
ª
©
ª
©©
ªª
although 1, 3 6⊆ B, it is true that 1, 3 ∈ B. Also, 1, 3 ⊆ B.

Though they should help you understand the concept of subset, the
above examples are somewhat artificial. But in general, subsets arise very
©
ª
naturally. For instance, consider the unit circle C = (x, y) ∈ R2 : x2 + y2 = 1 .

This is a subset C ⊆ R2 . Likewise the graph of a function y = f (x) is a set

of points G = (x, f (x)) : x ∈ R , and G ⊆ R2 . Surely sets such as C and G
are more easily understood or visualized when regarded as subsets of R2 .
Mathematics is filled with such instances where it is important to regard
one set as a subset of another.

1.4 Power Sets
Given a set, you can form a new set with the power set operation.
Definition 1.4 If A is a set, the power set of A is another set, denoted
as P (A) and defined to be the set of all subsets of A . In symbols, P (A) =
©
ª
X:X⊆A .
©

ª

For example, suppose A = 1, 2, 3 . The power set of A is the set of all
subsets of A . We learned how to find these subsets in the previous section,
©ª © ª © ª © ª ©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
©
ª
and they are , 1 , 2 , 3 , 1, 2 , 1, 3 , 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3 . Therefore the
power set of A is
n

P (A) = ;, 1 , 2 , 3 , 1, 2 , 1, 3 , 2, 3 , 1, 2, 3

.

As we saw in the previous section, if a finite set A has n elements, then
it has 2n subsets, and thus its power set has 2n elements.
Fact 1.4 If A is a finite set, then |P (A)| = 2| A | .

how (or if) they could be arranged in a list with a definite pattern:

The set P (R2 ) is mind boggling. Think of R2 = (x, y) : x, y ∈ R as the set
of all points on the Cartesian plane. A subset of R2 (that is, an element of
P (R2 )) is a set of points in the plane. Let’s look at some of these sets. Since
©
ª
©
ª
(1, 2), (1, 1) ⊆ R2 , we know that (1, 2), (1, 1) ∈ P (R2 ). We can even draw a
picture of this subset, as in Figure 1.4(a). For another example, the graph
©
ª
of the equation y = x2 is the set of points G = (x, x2 ) : x ∈ R and this is a
subset of R2 , so G ∈ P (R2 ). Figure 1.4(b) is a picture of G . Because this can
be done for any function, the graph of any imaginable function f : R → R is
an element of P (R2 ).

Figure 1.4. Three of the many, many sets in P (R2 )
In fact, any black-and-white image on the plane can be thought of as
a subset of R2 , where the black points belong to the subset and the white
points do not. So the text “INFINITE” in Figure 1.4(c) is a subset of R2 and
therefore an element of P (R2 ). By that token, P (R2 ) contains a copy of the
page you are reading now.
Thus, in addition to containing every imaginable function and every
imaginable black-and-white image, P (R2 ) also contains the full text of every
book that was ever written, those that are yet to be written and those that
will never be written. Inside of P (R2 ) is a detailed biography of your life,
from beginning to end, as well as the biographies of all of your unborn
descendants. It is startling that the five symbols used to write P (R2 ) can
express such an incomprehensibly large set.
Homework: Think about P (P (R2 )).

1.5 Union, Intersection, Difference

Just as numbers are combined with operations such as addition, subtraction
and multiplication, there are various operations that can be applied to sets.
The Cartesian product (defined in Section 1.2) is one such operation; given
sets A and B, we can combine them with × to get a new set A × B. Here are
three new operations called union, intersection and difference.
Definition 1.5 Suppose A and B are sets.
©
ª
The union of A and B is the set
A ∪ B = x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B .
©
ª
The intersection of A and B is the set A ∩ B = x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B .
©
ª
The difference of A and B is the set
A − B = x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B .
In words, the union A ∪ B is the set of all things that are in A or in B (or
in both). The intersection A ∩ B is the set of all things in both A and B. The
difference A − B is the set of all things that are in A but not in B.

1.6 Complement
This section introduces yet another set operation, called the set complement.
The definition requires the idea of a universal set, which we now discuss.
When dealing with a set, we almost always regard it as a subset of
some larger set. For example, consider the set of prime numbers P =
©
ª
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, . . . . If asked to name some things that are not in P , we
might mention some composite numbers like 4 or 6 or 423. It probably
would not occur to us to say that Vladimir Putin is not in P . True, Vladimir
Putin is not in P , but he lies entirely outside of the discussion of what is a
prime number and what is not. We have an unstated assumption that
P ⊆N

because N is the most natural setting in which to discuss prime numbers.
In this context, anything not in P should still be in N. This larger set N is
called the universal set or universe for P .
Almost every useful set in mathematics can be regarded as having some
©
natural universal set. For instance, the unit circle is the set C = (x, y) ∈ R2 :
ª
x2 + y2 = 1 , and since all these points are in the plane R2 it is natural to
regard R2 as the universal set for C . In the absence of specifics, if A is a set,
then its universal set is often denoted as U . We are now ready to define the
complement operation.
Definition 1.6 Let A be a set with a universal set U . The complement
of A , denoted A , is the set A = U − A .

1.7 Venn Diagrams

In thinking about sets, it is sometimes helpful to draw informal, schematic
diagrams of them. In doing this we often represent a set with a circle
(or oval), which we regard as enclosing all the elements of the set. Such
diagrams can illustrate how sets combine using various operations. For
example, Figures 1.7(a–c) show two sets A and B that overlap in a middle
region. The sets A ∪ B, A ∩ B and A − B are shaded. Such graphical representations of sets are called Venn diagrams, after their inventor, British
logician John Venn, 1834–1923.

Figure 1.7. Venn diagrams for two sets
Though you are unlikely to draw Venn diagrams as a part of a proof of
any theorem, you will probably find them to be useful “scratch work” devices
that help you to understand how sets combine, and to develop strategies
for proving certain theorems or solving certain problems. The remainder of
this section uses Venn diagrams to explore how three sets can be combined
using ∪ and ∩.
Let’s begin with the set A ∪ B ∪ C . Our definitions suggest this should
consist of all elements which are in one or more of the sets A , B and C .
Figure 1.8(a) shows a Venn diagram for this. Similarly, we think of A ∩ B ∩ C
as all elements common to each of A , B and C , so in Figure 1.8(b) the region
belonging to all three sets is shaded.

We can also think of A ∩ B ∩ C as the two-step operation (A ∩ B) ∩ C . In
this expression the set A ∩ B is represented by the region common to both A
and B, and when we intersect this with C we get Figure 1.8(b). This is a
visual representation of the fact that A ∩ B ∩ C = (A ∩ B) ∩ C . Similarly, we
have A ∩ B ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C). Likewise, A ∪ B ∪ C = (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C).
Notice that in these examples, where the expression either contains only
the symbol ∪ or only the symbol ∩, the placement of the parentheses is
irrelevant, so we are free to drop them. It is analogous to the situations in
algebra involving expressions (a + b)+ c = a +(b + c) or (a · b)· c = a ·(b · c). We tend
to drop the parentheses and write simply a + b + c or a · b · c. By contrast, in
an expression like (a + b) · c the parentheses are absolutely essential because
(a + b) · c and a + (b · c) are generally not equal.
Now let’s use Venn diagrams to help us understand the expressions
(A ∪ B) ∩ C and A ∪ (B ∩ C), which use a mix of ∪ and ∩. Figure 1.9 shows
how to draw a Venn diagram for (A ∪ B) ∩ C . In the drawing on the left, the
set A ∪ B is shaded with horizontal lines, while C is shaded with vertical
lines. Thus the set (A ∪ B) ∩ C is represented by the cross-hatched region
where A ∪ B and C overlap. The superfluous shadings are omitted in the
drawing on the right showing the set (A ∪ B) ∩ C .

horizontal lines, and B ∩ C is shaded with vertical lines. The union A ∪ (B ∩ C)
is represented by the totality of all shaded regions, as shown on the right.

Compare the diagrams for (A ∪ B) ∩ C and A ∪ (B ∩ C) in Figures 1.9 and
1.10. The fact that the diagrams are different indicates that (A ∪ B) ∩ C 6=
A ∪ (B ∩ C) in general. Thus an expression such as A ∪ B ∩ C is absolutely
meaningless because we can’t tell whether it means (A ∪ B) ∩ C or A ∪ (B ∩ C).
In summary, Venn diagrams have helped us understand the following.
Important Points:
• If an expression involving sets uses only ∪, then parentheses are optional.
• If an expression involving sets uses only ∩, then parentheses are optional.
• If an expression uses both ∪ and ∩, then parentheses are essential.

In the next section we will study types of expressions that use only ∪ or
only ∩. These expressions will not require the use of parentheses.

1.8 Indexed Sets
When a mathematical problem involves lots of sets, it is often convenient to
keep track of them by using subscripts (also called indices). Thus instead of
denoting three sets as A , B and C , we might instead write them as A 1 , A 2
and A 3 . These are called indexed sets.
Although we defined union and intersection to be operations that combine two sets, you by now have no difficulty forming unions and intersections
of three or more sets. (For instance, in the previous section we drew Venn
diagrams for the intersection and union of three sets.) But let’s take a
moment to write down careful definitions. Given sets A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n , the set
A 1 ∪ A 2 ∪ A 3 ∪ · · · ∪ A n consists of everything that is in at least one of the
sets A i . Likewise A 1 ∩ A 2 ∩ A 3 ∩· · ·∩ A n consists of everything that is common
to all of the sets A i . Here is a careful definition.
Definition 1.7

Suppose A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n are sets. Then

But if the number n of sets is large, these expressions can get messy. To
overcome this, we now develop some notation akin to sigma notation. You
already know that sigma notation is a convenient symbolism for expressing
sums of many numbers. Given numbers a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . . , a n , then
n

a i = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + a n .

i =1

Even if the list of numbers is infinite, the sum

X

a i = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + a i + · · ·

is often still meaningful. The notation we are about to introduce is very
similar to this. Given sets A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , . . . , A n , we define

Here we are taking the union or intersection of a collection of sets A i where

i is an element of some set, be it 1, 2, 3 or N. In general, the way this works
is that we will have a collection of sets A i for i ∈ I , where I is the set of
possible subscripts. The set I is called an index set.
It is important to realize that the set I need not even consist of integers.
(We could subscript with letters or real numbers, etc.) Since we are programmed to think of i as an integer, let’s make a slight notational change:
Use α, not i , to stand for an element of I . Thus we are dealing with a
collection of sets A α for α ∈ I . This leads to the following definition.

Example 1.14 In this example, all sets A α are all subsets of the plane R2 .
©
ª
Each α belongs to the index set I = [0, 2] = x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 , which is the set
of all real numbers between 0 and 2. For each number α ∈ I , define A α to be
the set A α = [α, 2] × [0, α], which is the rectangle on the x y-plane whose base
runs from α to 2 on the x-axis, and whose height is α. Some of these are
shown shaded below. (The dotted diagonal line y = x is not a part of any of
the sets, but is shown for clarity, as the upper left corner of each A α touches
it.) Note that these sets are not indexed with just integers. For example, as
p
2 ∈ I , there is a set A p2 , which shown below on the right.

Now consider the infinite union
A α . It is the shaded triangle shown

A α . Notice that the point (2, 0) on

the x-axis is the lower right corner of any set A α , so (2, 0) ∈ A α for any α ∈ I .
Therefore the point (2, 0) is in the intersection of all the A α . But any other
point (x, y) 6= (2, 0) on the triangle does not belong to all of the sets A α . The
reason is that if x < 2, then (x, y) ∉ A α for any x < α ≤ 2. (Check this.) And if
x = 2, then (x, y) ∉ A α for any 0 < α < y. Consequently

Example 1.15 Here our sets are indexed by R2 . For any (a, b) ∈ R2 , let P(a,b)
be the following subset of R3 :
©
ª
P(a,b) = (x, y, z) ∈ R3 : ax + b y = 0 .

In words, given a point (a, b) ∈ R2 , the corresponding set P(a,b) consists of
all points (x, y, z) in R3 that satisfy the equation ax + b y = 0. From previous
math courses you will recognize this as a plane in R3 , that is, P(a,b) is a plane
in R3 . Moreover, since any point (0, 0, z) on the z-axis automatically satisfies
ax + b y = 0, each P(a,b) contains the z-axis.
©

Figure 1.11 (left) shows the set P(1,2) = (x, y, z) ∈ R3 : x + 2y = 0 . It is the
vertical plane that intersects the x y-plane at the line x + 2y = 0.

Figure 1.11. The sets P(a,b) are vertical planes containing the z-axis.
For any point (a, b) ∈ R2 with (a, b) 6= (0, 0), we can visualize P(a,b) as the
vertical plane that cuts the x y-plane at the line ax + b y = 0. Figure 1.11
(right) shows a few of the P(a,b) . Since any two such planes intersect along
the z-axis, and because the z-axis is a subset of every P(a,b) , it is immediately
clear that

P(a,b) = (0, 0, z) : z ∈ R = “the z-axis”.

For the union, note that any given point (a, b, c) ∈ R3 belongs to the set
P(−b,a) because (x, y, z) = (a, b, c) satisfies the equation − bx + a y = 0. (In fact,
any (a, b, c) belongs to the special set P(0,0) = R3 , which is the only P(a,b) that
is not a plane.) Since any point in R3 belongs to some P(a,b) we have

1.9 Sets That Are Number Systems

In practice, the sets we tend to be most interested in often have special
properties and structures. For example, the sets Z, Q and R are familiar
number systems: Given such a set, any two of its elements can be added
(or multiplied, etc.) together to produce another element in the set. These
operations obey the familiar commutative, associative and distributive
properties that we all have dealt with for years. Such properties lead to
the standard algebraic techniques for solving equations. Even though we
are concerned with the idea of proof, we will not find it necessary to define,
prove or verify such properties and techniques; we will accept them as the
ground rules upon which our further deductions are based.
We also accept as fact the natural ordering of the elements of N, Z, Q and
R, so that (for example) the meaning of “5 < 7” is understood and does not
need to be justified or explained. Similarly, if x ≤ y and a 6= 0, we know that
ax ≤ a y or ax ≥ a y, depending on whether a is positive or negative.
Another thing that our ingrained understanding of number order tells
us is that any non-empty subset of N has a smallest element. In other words,
if A ⊆ N and A 6= ;, then there is an element x0 ∈ A that is smaller than
every other element of A . (To find it, start at 1, then move in increments to
2, 3, 4, etc., until you hit a number x0 ∈ A ; this is the smallest element of
©
ª
A .) Similarly, given b ∈ Z, any non-empty subset A ⊆ b, b + 1, b + 2, b + 3, . . .
has a smallest element. This fact is sometimes called the well-ordering
principle. There is no need to remember this term, but do be aware that
we will use this simple, intuitive idea often in proofs, usually without a
second thought.
The well-ordering principle seems innocent enough, but it actually says
something very fundamental and special about the positive integers N.
In fact, the corresponding statement for the positive real numbers is false:
©
ª
The subset A = n1 : n ∈ N of the positive reals has no smallest element
because for any x0 = n1 ∈ A we might pick, there is a smaller element n+1 1 ∈ A .
One consequence of the well-ordering principle (as we will see below) is
the familiar fact that any integer a can be divided by a non-zero integer b,
resulting in a quotient q and remainder r . For example, b = 3 goes into
a = 17 q = 5 times with remainder r = 2. In symbols, 17 = 5 · 3 + 2, or a = qb + r .
This significant fact is called the division algorithm.
Fact 1.5 (Division Algorithm) Given integers a and b with b > 0,
there exist unique integers q and r for which a = qb + r and 0 ≤ r < b.

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

Sets That Are Number Systems

31

Although there is no harm in accepting the division algorithm without
proof, note that it does follow from the well-ordering principle. Here’s how:
Given integers a, b with b > 0, form the set
©
ª ©
ª
A = a − xb : x ∈ Z, 0 ≤ a − xb ⊆ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .

This is the set of non-negative integers got by subtracting multiples of b
©
ª
from a. (Example: If a = 17 and b = 3, then we get A = 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, . . .
by subtracting multiples of 3 from 17. Note that the remainder r = 2 of 17 ÷ 3
is the smallest element of A .) In general, the well-ordering principle says
©
ª
the set A = a − xb : x ∈ Z, 0 ≤ a − xb has a smallest element r . Then r = a − qb
©
ª
for some x = q ∈ Z, so a = qb + r . Because r ∈ A ⊆ 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . , we know 0 ≤ r .
In addition, it cannot happen that r ≥ b: If this were the case, then the
non-negative number r − b = (a − qb) − b = a − (q + 1)b having form a − xb would
be a smaller element of A than r , and r was explicitly chosen as the smallest
element of A . Since it is not true that r ≥ b, it must be that r < b. Therefore
0 ≤ r < b. We’ve now produced a q and an r for which a = qb + r and 0 ≤ r < b.
(Exercise 28 of Chapter 7 asks you to prove q and r are unique in the sense
that no other values of q and r have these properties.)
Moving on, it is time to clarify a small issue. This chapter asserted that
all of mathematics can be described with sets. But at the same time we
maintained that some mathematical entities are not sets. (For instance,
our approach was to say that an individual number, such as 5, is not itself
a set, though it may be an element of a set.) We have made this distinction
because we need a place to stand as we explore sets: After all, it would
appear suspiciously circular to declare that every mathematical entity is a
set, and then go on to define a set as a collection whose members are sets!
But to most mathematicians, saying “The number 5 is not a set,” is like
saying “The number 5 is not a number.”
The truth is that any number can itself be understood as a set. One
way to do this is to begin with the identification 0 = ;. Then 1 = {;} =
©
ª
©
ª
{0}, and 2 = ;, {;} = {0, 1}, and 3 = ;, {;}, {;, {;}} = {0, 1, 2}. In general the
©
ª
natural number n is the set n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 of the n numbers (which are
themselves sets) that come before it.
We will not undertake such a study here, but the elements of the number
systems Z, Q and R can all be defined in terms of sets. (Even the operations
of addition, multiplication, etc., can be defined in set-theoretic terms.) In
fact, mathematics itself can be regarded as the study of things that can
be described as sets. Any mathematical entity is a set, whether or not we
choose to think of it that way.

1.10 Russell’s Paradox

This section contains some background information that may be interesting,
but is not used in the remainder of the book.
The philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) did
groundbreaking work on the theory of sets and the foundations of mathematics. He was probably among the first to understand how the misuse
of sets can lead to bizarre and paradoxical situations. He is famous for an
idea that has come to be known as Russell’s paradox.
Russell’s paradox involves the following set of sets:
©
ª
A = X : X is a set and X ∉ X .

(1.1)

In words, A is the set of all sets that do not include themselves as elements.
Most sets we can think of are in A . The set Z of integers is not an integer
(i.e., Z ∉ Z) and therefore Z ∈ A . Also ; ∈ A because ; is a set and ; ∉ ;.
©©©© ªªªª
Is there a set that is not in A ? Consider B =
...
. Think of B as a
box containing a box, containing a box, containing a box, and so on, forever.
Or a set of identical Russian dolls, nested one inside the other, endlessly.
The curious thing about B is that it has just one element, namely B itself:
B=

© ©©©

ªªª ª
...
.
| {z }
B

Thus B ∈ B. As B does not satisfy B ∉ B, Equation (1.1) says B ∉ A .
Russell’s paradox arises from the question “Is A an element of A ?”
For a set X , Equation (1.1) says X ∈ A means the same thing as X ∉ X .
So for X = A , the previous line says A ∈ A means the same thing as A ∉ A .
Conclusions: If A ∈ A is true, then it is false. If A ∈ A is false, then it is true.
This is Russell’s paradox.
Initially Russell’s paradox sparked a crisis among mathematicians. How
could a mathematical statement be both true and false? This seemed to be
in opposition to the very essence of mathematics.
The paradox instigated a very careful examination of set theory and
an evaluation of what can and cannot be regarded as a set. Eventually
mathematicians settled upon a collection of axioms for set theory—the
so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. One of these axioms is the wellordering principle of the previous section. Another, the axiom of foundation,
states that no non-empty set X is allowed to have the property X ∩ x 6= ; for
© ª
all its elements x. This rules out such circularly defined “sets” as B = B
mentioned above. If we adhere to these axioms, then situations like Russell’s

Russell’s Paradox

paradox disappear. Most mathematicians accept all this on faith and happily
ignore the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. Paradoxes like Russell’s do not tend
to come up in everyday mathematics—you have to go out of your way to
construct them.
Still, Russell’s paradox reminds us that precision of thought and language is an important part of doing mathematics. The next chapter deals
with the topic of logic, a codification of thought and language.

CHAPTER 2

Logic

ogic is a systematic way of thinking that allows us to parse the meanings
of sentences and to deduce new information from old information. You
use logic informally in everyday life and certainly also in doing mathematics.
For example, say you are working with a certain circle (call it “Circle X”),
and suppose you have available the following two pieces of information.

L

1. Circle X has a radius of 3 units.
2. If any circle has radius r , then its area is π r 2 square units.

You have no trouble putting these two facts together to get:
3. Circle X has area 9π square units.

In doing this you are using logic to combine existing information to
produce new information. Because deducing new information is central to
mathematics, logic plays a fundamental role. This chapter is intended to
give you a sufficient mastery of it.
It is important to realize that logic is a process of deducing information
correctly, not just deducing correct information. For example, suppose we
were mistaken and Circle X actually had a radius of 4, not 3. Let’s look at
our exact same argument again.
1. Circle X has a radius of 3 units.
2. If any circle has radius r , then its area is π r 2 square units.
3. Circle X has area 9π square units.

The sentence “Circle X has a radius of 3 units.” is now untrue, and so is our
conclusion “Circle X has area 9π square units.” But the logic is perfectly
correct; the information was combined correctly, even if some of it was false.
This distinction between correct logic and correct information is significant
because it is often important to follow the consequences of an incorrect
assumption. Ideally, we want both our logic and our information to be
correct, but the point is that they are different things.

Statements

35

In proving theorems, we apply logic to information that is considered
obviously true (such as “Any two points determine exactly one line.”) or is
already known to be true (e.g., the Pythagorean theorem). If our logic is
correct, then anything we deduce from such information will also be true
(or at least as true as the “obviously true” information we began with).
2.1 Statements
The study of logic begins with statements. A statement is a sentence or
a mathematical expression that is either definitely true or definitely false.
You can think of statements as pieces of information that are either correct
or incorrect. Thus statements are pieces of information that we might
apply logic to in order to produce other pieces of information (which are also
statements).
Example 2.1

Here are some examples of statements. They are all true.

If a circle has radius r , then its area is π r 2 square units.
Every even number is divisible by 2.
2∈Z
p
2∉Z
N⊆Z

The set {0, 1, 2} has three elements.
Some right triangles are isosceles.
Example 2.2

Here are some additional statements. They are all false.

All right triangles are isosceles.
5=2
p
2∉R
Z⊆N

{0, 1, 2} ∩ N = ;

Example 2.3

Here non-statements are paired with similar statements.

NOT a statement:

Example 2.4 We will often use the letters P , Q , R and S to stand for
specific statements. When more letters are needed we can use subscripts.
Here are more statements, designated with letters. You decide which of
them are true and which are false.
P : For every integer n > 1, the number 2n − 1 is prime.
Q : Every polynomial of degree n has at most n roots.
R : The function f (x) = x2 is continuous.
S1 : Z ⊆ ;
S 2 : {0, −1, −2} ∩ N = ;

Designating statements with letters (as was done above) is a very useful
shorthand. In discussing a particular statement, such as “The function
f (x) = x2 is continuous,” it is convenient to just refer to it as R to avoid having
to write or say it many times.
Statements can contain variables. Here is an example.
P : If an integer x is a multiple of 6, then x is even.

This is a sentence that is true. (All multiples of 6 are even, so no matter
which multiple of 6 the integer x happens to be, it is even.) Since the sentence
P is definitely true, it is a statement. When a sentence or statement P
contains a variable such as x, we sometimes denote it as P(x) to indicate that
it is saying something about x. Thus the above statement can be denoted as
P(x) : If an integer x is a multiple of 6, then x is even.

A statement or sentence involving two variables might be denoted P(x, y),
and so on.
It is quite possible for a sentence containing variables to not be a statement. Consider the following example.
Q(x) : The integer x is even.

Is this a statement? Whether it is true or false depends on just which integer
x is. It is true if x = 4 and false if x = 7, etc. But without any stipulations on
the value of x it is impossible to say whether Q(x) is true or false. Since it
is neither definitely true nor definitely false, Q(x) cannot be a statement.
A sentence such as this, whose truth depends on the value of one or more
variables, is called an open sentence. The variables in an open sentence
(or statement) can represent any type of entity, not just numbers. Here is
an open sentence where the variables are functions:

Statements

R( f, g) : The function f is the derivative of the function g.

This open sentence is true if f (x) = 2x and g(x) = x2 . It is false if f (x) = x3
and g(x) = x2 , etc. A sentence such as R( f, g) (that involves variables) can be
denoted either as R( f, g) or just R . We use the expression R( f, g) when we
want to emphasize that the sentence involves variables.
We will have more to say about open sentences later, but for now let’s
return to statements.
Statements are everywhere in mathematics. Any result or theorem
that has been proved true is a statement. The quadratic formula and the
Pythagorean theorem are both statements:
p
− b ± b2 − 4ac
P : The solutions of the equation ax + bx + c = 0 are x =
.
2a
2

Q:

If a right triangle has legs of lengths a and b and hypotenuse of
length c, then a2 + b2 = c2 .

Here is a very famous statement, so famous, in fact, that it has a name.
It is called Fermat’s last theorem after Pierre Fermat, a seventeenthcentury French mathematician who scribbled it in the margin of a book.
R : For all numbers a, b, c, n ∈ N with n > 2, it is the case that a n + b n 6= c n .

Fermat believed this statement to be true. He noted that he could prove it
was true, except the book’s margin was too narrow to contain his proof. It
is doubtful that he really had a correct proof in mind, for after his death
many generations of brilliant mathematicians tried unsuccessfully to prove
that his statement was true (or false). Finally, in 1993, Andrew Wiles of
Princeton University announced that he had devised a proof. Wiles had
worked on the problem for over seven years, and his proof runs through
hundreds of pages. The moral of this story is that some true statements
are not obviously true.
Here is another statement famous enough to be named. It was first
posed in the eighteenth century by the German mathematician Christian
Goldbach, and thus is called the Goldbach conjecture:
S : Every even integer greater than 2 is a sum of two prime numbers.

You must agree that S is either true or false. It appears to be true, because
when you examine even numbers that are bigger than 2, they seem to be
sums of two primes: 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, 10 = 5 + 5, 12 = 5 + 7,
100 = 17 + 83 and so on. But that’s not to say there isn’t some large even

number that’s not the sum of two primes. If such a number exists, then S
is false. The thing is, in the over 260 years since Goldbach first posed this
problem, no one has been able to determine whether it’s true or false. But
since it is clearly either true or false, S is a statement.
This book is about the methods that can be used to prove that S (or any
other statement) is true or false. To prove that S is true, start with obvious
statements (or other statements that have been proven true) and use logic
to deduce more and more complex statements until finally we obtain the
statement S . Of course some statements are more difficult to prove than
others, and S appears to be notoriously difficult; we will concentrate on
statements that are easier to prove.
But the point is this: In proving that statements are true, we use logic
to help us understand statements and to combine pieces of information
to produce new pieces of information. In the next several sections we
explore some standard ways that statements can be combined to form new
statements, or broken down into simpler statements.

2.2 And, Or, Not
The word “and” can be used to combine two statements to form a new
statement. Consider for example the following sentence.
R 1 : The number 2 is even and the number 3 is odd.

We recognize this as a true statement, based on our ingrained understanding
of the meaning of the word “and.” Notice that R1 is made up of two simpler
statements:
P : The number 2 is even.
Q : The number 3 is odd.

These are joined together by the word “and” to form the more complex
statement R1 . The statement R1 asserts that P and Q are both true. Since
both P and Q are in fact true, the statement R1 is also true.
Had one or both of P and Q been false, then R1 would be false. For
instance, each of the following statements is false.
R 2 : The number 1 is even and the number 3 is odd.
R 3 : The number 2 is even and the number 4 is odd.
R 4 : The number 3 is even and the number 2 is odd.

From these examples we see that any two statements P and Q can be
combined to form a new statement “P and Q .” In the spirit of using letters
to denote statements, we now introduce the special symbol ∧ to stand for the
word “and.” Thus if P and Q are statements, P ∧ Q stands for the statement
“P and Q .” The statement P ∧ Q is true if both P and Q are true; otherwise
it is false. This is summarized in the following table, called a truth table.
P

Q

P ∧Q

In this table, T stands for “True,” and F stands for “False.” (T and F are
called truth values.) Each line lists one of the four possible combinations
or truth values for P and Q , and the column headed by P ∧ Q tells whether
the statement P ∧ Q is true or false in each case.

Statements can also be combined using the word “or.” Consider the
following four statements.
S 1 : The number 2 is even or the number 3 is odd.
S 2 : The number 1 is even or the number 3 is odd.
S 3 : The number 2 is even or the number 4 is odd.
S 4 : The number 3 is even or the number 2 is odd.

In mathematics, the assertion “P or Q ” is always understood to mean that
one or both of P and Q is true. Thus statements S1 , S2 , S3 are all true,
while S4 is false. The symbol ∨ is used to stand for the word “or.” So if P
and Q are statements, P ∨ Q represents the statement “P or Q .” Here is the
truth table.

It is important to be aware that the meaning of “or” expressed in the
above table differs from the way it is often used in everyday conversation.
For example, suppose a university official makes the following threat:
You pay your tuition or you will be withdrawn from school.
You understand that this means that either you pay your tuition or you will
be withdrawn from school, but not both. In mathematics we never use the
word “or” in such a sense. For us “or” means exactly what is stated in the
table for ∨. Thus P ∨ Q being true means one or both of P and Q is true. If
we ever need to express the fact that exactly one of P and Q is true, we use
one of the following constructions:
P or Q , but not both.

Either P or Q .
Exactly one of P or Q .
If the university official were a mathematician, he might have qualified his
statement in one of the following ways.
Pay your tuition or you will be withdrawn from school, but not both.
Either you pay your tuition or you will be withdrawn from school.

To conclude this section, we mention another way of obtaining new
statements from old ones. Given any statement P , we can form the new
statement “It is not true that P .” For example, consider the following
statement.
The number 2 is even.
This statement is true. Now change it by inserting the words “It is not true
that” at the beginning:
It is not true that the number 2 is even.
This new statement is false.
For another example, starting with the false statement “2 ∈ ;,” we get
the true statement “It is not true that 2 ∈ ;.”
We use the symbol ∼ to stand for the words “It’s not true that,” so ∼ P
means “It’s not true that P .” We can read ∼ P simply as “not P .” Unlike
∧ and ∨, which combine two statements, the symbol ∼ just alters a single
statement. Thus its truth table has just two lines, one for each possible
value of P .
P

∼P

T

T

The statement ∼ P is called the negation of P . The negation of a specific
statement can be expressed in numerous ways. Consider
P : The number 2 is even.

Here are several ways of expressing its negation.
∼ P : It’s not true that the number 2 is even.
∼ P : It is false that the number 2 is even.
∼ P : The number 2 is not even.

In this section we’ve learned how to combine or modify statements with
the operations ∧, ∨ and ∼. Of course we can also apply these operations
to open sentences or a mixture of open sentences and statements. For
example, (x is an even integer) ∧ (3 is an odd integer) is an open sentence
that is a combination of an open sentence and a statement.

2.3 Conditional Statements
There is yet another way to combine two statements. Suppose we have in
mind a specific integer a. Consider the following statement about a.
R : If the integer a is a multiple of 6, then a is divisible by 2.

We immediately spot this as a true statement based on our knowledge of
integers and the meanings of the words “if” and “then.” If integer a is a
multiple of 6, then a is even, so therefore a is divisible by 2. Notice that R is
built up from two simpler statements:
P : The integer a is a multiple of 6.
Q : The integer a is divisible by 2.
R : If P , then Q .

In general, given any two statements P and Q whatsoever, we can form
the new statement “If P , then Q .” This is written symbolically as P ⇒ Q
which we read as “If P , then Q ,” or “P implies Q .” Like ∧ and ∨, the symbol
⇒ has a very specific meaning. When we assert that the statement P ⇒ Q
is true, we mean that if P is true then Q must also be true. (In other words
we mean that the condition P being true forces Q to be true.) A statement
of form P ⇒ Q is called a conditional statement because it means Q will
be true under the condition that P is true.

Think of P ⇒ Q as a promise that whenever P is true, Q will be true also.
There is only one way this promise can be broken (i.e., be false), namely if P
is true but Q is false. So the truth table for the promise P ⇒ Q is as follows:
P

Q

Perhaps you are bothered by how P ⇒ Q is true in the last two lines. Here
is an example to explain it. Suppose your professor makes this promise:
If you pass the final exam, then you will pass the course.
Your professor is making the promise
(You pass the exam) ⇒ (You pass the course).
Under what circumstances did she lie? There are four possible scenarios,
depending on whether or not you passed the exam and whether or not you
passed the course. These scenarios are tallied in the following table.
You pass exam

You pass course

(You pass exam) ⇒ (You pass course)

T

T

T

T

F

The first row is the scenario in which you pass the exam and you pass
the course. Clearly the professor kept her promise, so the T in the third
column indicates that she told the truth. In the second row, you passed the
exam but failed the course. In this case your professor broke her promise,
and the F in the third column indicates that what she said was untrue.
The third row describes the scenario in which you failed the exam but
still passed the course. How could that happen? Maybe your professor felt
sorry for you. But that doesn’t make her a liar. Her only promise was that
if you passed the exam then you would pass the course. She did not say
passing the exam was the only way to pass the course. Since she didn’t lie,
then she told the truth, so there is a T in the third column.
Finally look at the fourth row: you failed the exam and failed the course.
Your professor certainly did not lie to you. Hence the T in the third column.

For another example, consider this statement:
If this month is September, then there is an equinox this month.

An equinox is a day for which there are equal hours of darkness and light.
There are two equinoxes per year, one in September and the other in March.
The above statement is thus unquestionably true, for it asserts correctly
that if the current month is September, then an equinox will occur this
month. In symbolic form, our statement is
(This month is September) ⇒ (There is an equinox this month).
This statement is true, but the open sentences P : “This month is September,”
and Q : “There is an equinox this month,” are either true or false, depending
on what month it is. But P ⇒ Q is always true. This is shown below for
three (out of 12) months. Notice how P ⇒ Q is true, even when P is false.

As P ⇒ Q is a true statement in this particular example, there is no month
with P true and Q false. (Unless we imagine that Earth is destroyed by an
asteroid before September 21, a possibility that we shall not entertain.)
In mathematics, whenever we encounter the construction “If P , then Q ,”
it means exactly what the truth table for ⇒ expresses. Of course there are
other grammatical constructions that also mean P ⇒ Q . Here is a summary
of the main ones. The meaning of each is encapsulated by the table for ⇒.
If P , then Q .
Q if P .
Q whenever P .
Q , provided that P .
Whenever P , then also Q .
P is a sufficient condition for Q .
For Q , it is sufficient that P .

These can all be used in the place of (and mean exactly the same thing
as) “If P , then Q .” You should analyze the meaning of each one and convince
yourself that it captures the meaning of P ⇒ Q . For example, P ⇒ Q means
the condition of P being true is enough (i.e., sufficient) to make Q true;
hence “P is a sufficient condition for Q .”
The wording can be tricky. An everyday situation may help clarify it.
For example, consider your professor’s promise:
(You pass the exam) ⇒ (You pass the course).
This means that your passing the exam is a sufficient (though perhaps not
necessary) condition for your passing the course. Thus your professor might
just as well have phrased her promise in one of the following ways.
Passing the exam is a sufficient condition for passing the course.
For you to pass the course, it is sufficient that you pass the exam.
However, when we want to say “If P , then Q ” in everyday conversation,
we do not normally express this as “Q is a necessary condition for P ” or
“P only if Q .” But such constructions are not uncommon in mathematics.
To understand why they make sense, notice that P ⇒ Q being true means
that it’s impossible that P is true but Q is false, so in order for P to be true
it is necessary that Q is true; hence “Q is a necessary condition for P .” And
this means that P can only be true if Q is true, i.e., “P only if Q .”

2.4 Biconditional Statements
It is important to understand that P ⇒ Q is not the same as Q ⇒ P . To see
why, suppose that a is some integer and consider the statements
(a is a multiple of 6)
(a is divisible by 2)

⇒ (a is divisible by 2),
⇒ (a is a multiple of 6).

The first statement asserts that if a is a multiple of 6 then a is divisible
by 2. This is clearly true, for any multiple of 6 is even and therefore divisible
by 2. The second statement asserts that if a is divisible by 2 then it is a
multiple of 6. This is not necessarily true, for a = 4 (for instance) is divisible
by 2, yet not a multiple of 6. Therefore the meanings of P ⇒ Q and Q ⇒ P
are in general quite different. The conditional statement Q ⇒ P is called
the converse of P ⇒ Q , so a conditional statement and its converse express
entirely different things.
But sometimes, if P and Q are just the right statements, it can happen
that P ⇒ Q and Q ⇒ P are both necessarily true. For example, consider the
statements
(a is even)
(a is divisible by 2)

⇒ (a is divisible by 2),
⇒ (a is even).

No matter what value a has, both of these statements are true. Since both
P ⇒ Q and Q ⇒ P are true, it follows that (P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P) is true.
Let’s introduce a new symbol ⇔ to express the meaning of the statement
(P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P). The expression P ⇔ Q is understood to have exactly the
same meaning as (P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P). According to the previous section, Q ⇒ P
is read as “P if Q ,” and P ⇒ Q can be read as “P only if Q .” Therefore we
pronounce P ⇔ Q as “P if and only if Q .” For example, given an integer a,
we have the true statement
(a is even) ⇔ (a is divisible by 2),
which we can read as “The integer a is even if and only if a is divisible by 2.”

The truth table for ⇔ is shown below. Notice that in the first and last
rows, both P ⇒ Q and Q ⇒ P are true (according to the truth table for ⇒), so
(P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P) is true, and hence P ⇔ Q is true. However, in the middle
two rows one of P ⇒ Q or Q ⇒ P is false, so (P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P) is false, making
P ⇔ Q false.

Compare the statement R : (a is even) ⇔ (a is divisible by 2) with this
truth table. If a is even then the two statements on either side of ⇔ are
true, so according to the table R is true. If a is odd then the two statements
on either side of ⇔ are false, and again according to the table R is true.
Thus R is true no matter what value a has. In general, P ⇔ Q being true
means P and Q are both true or both false.
Not surprisingly, there are many ways of saying P ⇔ Q in English. The
following constructions all mean P ⇔ Q :
P if and only if Q .
P is a necessary and sufficient condition for Q .
For P it is necessary and sufficient that Q .
P is equivalent to Q .

2.5 Truth Tables for Statements

You should now know the truth tables for ∧, ∨, ∼, ⇒ and ⇔. They should
be internalized as well as memorized. You must understand the symbols
thoroughly, for we now combine them to form more complex statements.
For example, suppose we want to convey that one or the other of P and Q
is true but they are not both true. No single symbol expresses this, but we
could combine them as
(P ∨ Q) ∧ ∼ (P ∧ Q),

which literally means:
P or Q is true, and it is not the case that both P and Q are true.

This statement will be true or false depending on the truth values of P and Q .
In fact we can make a truth table for the entire statement. Begin as usual
by listing the possible true/false combinations of P and Q on four lines. The
statement (P ∨ Q)∧ ∼ (P ∧ Q) contains the individual statements (P ∨ Q) and
(P ∧ Q), so we next tally their truth values in the third and fourth columns.
The fifth column lists values for ∼ (P ∧ Q), and these are just the opposites
of the corresponding entries in the fourth column. Finally, combining the
third and fifth columns with ∧, we get the values for (P ∨ Q)∧ ∼ (P ∧ Q) in
the sixth column.

This truth table tells us that (P ∨ Q)∧ ∼ (P ∧ Q) is true precisely when one
but not both of P and Q are true, so it has the meaning we intended. (Notice
that the middle three columns of our truth table are just “helper columns”
and are not necessary parts of the table. In writing truth tables, you may
choose to omit such columns if you are confident about your work.)
For another example, consider the following familiar statement about
real numbers x and y:
The product x y equals zero if and only if x = 0 or y = 0.
This can be modeled as (x y = 0) ⇔ (x = 0 ∨ y = 0). If we introduce letters P,Q
and R for the statements x y = 0, x = 0 and y = 0, it becomes P ⇔ (Q ∨R). Notice
that the parentheses are necessary here, for without them we wouldn’t know
whether to read the statement as P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) or (P ⇔ Q) ∨ R .

We fill in the fourth column using our knowledge of the truth table for ∨.
Finally the fifth column is filled in by combining the first and fourth columns
with our understanding of the truth table for ⇔. The resulting table gives
the true/false values of P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) for all values of P , Q and R .
Notice that when we plug in various values for x and y, the statements
P : x y = 0, Q : x = 0 and R : y = 0 have various truth values, but the statement
P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) is always true. For example, if x = 2 and y = 3, then P , Q and
R are all false. This scenario is described in the last row of the table, and
there we see that P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) is true. Likewise if x = 0 and y = 7, then P
and Q are true and R is false, a scenario described in the second line of
the table, where again P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) is true. There is a simple reason why
P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) is true for any values of x and y: It is that P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) represents
(x y = 0) ⇔ (x = 0 ∨ y = 0), which is a true mathematical statement. It is
absolutely impossible for it to be false.
This may make you wonder about the lines in the table where P ⇔ (Q ∨ R)
is false. Why are they there? The reason is that P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) can also
represent a false statement. To see how, imagine that at the end of the
semester your professor makes the following promise.
You pass the class if and only if you get an “A” on the final or you get a
“B” on the final.
This promise has the form P ⇔ (Q ∨ R), so its truth values are tabulated in
the above table. Imagine it turned out that you got an “A” on the exam but
failed the course. Then surely your professor lied to you. In fact, P is false,
Q is true and R is false. This scenario is reflected in the sixth line of the
table, and indeed P ⇔ (Q ∨ R) is false (i.e., it is a lie).

The moral of this example is that people can lie, but true mathematical
statements never lie.
We close this section with a word about the use of parentheses. The
symbol ∼ is analogous to the minus sign in algebra. It negates the expression
it precedes. Thus ∼ P ∨ Q means (∼ P) ∨ Q , not ∼ (P ∨ Q). In ∼ (P ∨ Q), the
value of the entire expression P ∨ Q is negated.

2.6 Logical Equivalence
In contemplating the truth table for P ⇔ Q , you probably noticed that P ⇔ Q
is true exactly when P and Q are both true or both false. In other words,
P ⇔ Q is true precisely when at least one of the statements P ∧ Q or ∼ P ∧ ∼ Q
is true. This may tempt us to say that P ⇔ Q means the same thing as
(P ∧ Q) ∨ (∼ P ∧ ∼ Q).
To see if this is really so, we can write truth tables for P ⇔ Q and
(P ∧ Q) ∨ (∼ P ∧ ∼ Q). In doing this, it is more efficient to put these two
statements into the same table, as follows. (This table has helper columns
for the intermediate expressions ∼ P , ∼ Q , (P ∧ Q) and (∼ P ∧ ∼ Q).)

variables P and Q . We express this state of affairs by writing
P ⇔ Q = (P ∧ Q) ∨ (∼ P ∧ ∼ Q)

and saying that P ⇔ Q and (P ∧ Q) ∨ (∼ P ∧ ∼ Q) are logically equivalent.
In general, two statements are logically equivalent if their truth
values match up line-for-line in a truth table.
Logical equivalence is important because it can give us different (and
potentially useful) ways of looking at the same thing. As an example, the
following table shows that P ⇒ Q is logically equivalent to (∼ Q) ⇒ (∼ P).

The fact P ⇒ Q = (∼ Q) ⇒ (∼ P) is useful because so many theorems have
the form P ⇒ Q . As we will see in Chapter 5, proving such a theorem may
be easier if we express it in the logically equivalent form (∼ Q) ⇒ (∼ P).
Two pairs of logically equivalent statements in particular are significant
enough to have a special name: DeMorgan’s laws.
Fact 2.1 (DeMorgan’s Laws)
1. ∼ (P ∧ Q) = (∼ P) ∨ (∼ Q)
2. ∼ (P ∨ Q) = (∼ P) ∧ (∼ Q)

DeMorgan’s laws are actually very natural and intuitive. Consider the
statement ∼ (P ∧ Q), which we can interpret as meaning that it is not the
case that both P and Q are true. If it is not the case that both P and Q are
true, then at least one of P or Q is false, in which case (∼ P) ∨ (∼ Q) is true.
Thus ∼ (P ∧ Q) means the same thing as (∼ P) ∨ (∼ Q).

DeMorgan’s laws can be very useful. Suppose we happen to know that
some statement of form ∼ (P ∨ Q) is true. The second of DeMorgan’s laws
tells us that (∼ Q) ∧ (∼ P) is also true, hence ∼ P and ∼ Q are both true as
well. Quickly obtaining this additional information can be extremely useful.
Here is a summary of some significant logical equivalences. Those that
are not immediately obvious can be verified with truth tables.

Notice how the distributive law P ∧ (Q ∨ R) = (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) has the
same structure as the distributive law p · (q + r) = p · q + p · r from algebra.
Concerning the associative laws, the fact that P ∧ (Q ∧ R) = (P ∧ Q) ∧ R means
that the position of the parentheses is irrelevant, and we can write this as
P ∧ Q ∧ R without ambiguity. Similarly, we may drop the parentheses in an
expression such as P ∨ (Q ∨ R).
But parentheses are essential when there is a mix of ∧ and ∨, as in
P ∨ (Q ∧ R). Indeed, P ∨ (Q ∧ R) and (P ∨ Q) ∧ R are not logically equivalent.

Quantifiers

2.7 Quantifiers
Using symbols ∧, ∨, ∼, ⇒ and ⇔, we can deconstruct many English sentences
into a symbolic form. As we have seen, this symbolic form can help us
understand the logical structure of sentences and how different sentences
may actually have the same meaning (as in logical equivalence).
But these symbols alone are not powerful enough to capture the full
meaning of every statement. To see why, imagine that we are dealing with
©
ª
an infinite set X = x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . of integers. Suppose we want to express
the statement “Every element of X is odd.” We would have to write
P(x1 ) ∧ P(x2 ) ∧ P(x3 ) ∧ P(x4 ) ∧ · · · ,

where P(x) is the open sentence “ x is odd.” And if we wanted to express
“There is at least one element of X that is odd,” we’d have to write
P(x1 ) ∨ P(x2 ) ∨ P(x3 ) ∨ P(x4 ) ∨ · · · .

The problem is that these expressions trail on forever.
To overcome this defect, we will introduce two new symbols ∀ and ∃. The
symbol ∀ stands for the phrase “for all” and ∃ stands for “there exists.” Thus
the statement “Every element of X is odd.” is written symbolically as
∀ x ∈ X , P(x),

and “There is at least one element of X that is odd,” is written succinctly as
∃ x ∈ X , P(x),

These new symbols are called quantifiers.
Definition 2.1

The symbols ∀ and ∃ are called quantifiers.

∀ stands for the phrase “For all” or “For every,” or “For each,”
∃ stands for the phrase “There exists a” or “There is a.”

Thus the statement
For every n ∈ Z, 2n is even,
can be expressed in either of the following ways:
∀ n ∈ Z, 2n is even,
∀ n ∈ Z, E(2n).

Logic

54
Likewise, a statement such as
There exists a subset X of N for which | X | = 5.
can be translated as
∃ X , (X ⊆ N) ∧ (| X | = 5)

or

∃ X ⊆ N, | X | = 5

or

∃ X ∈ P (N), | X | = 5.

The symbols ∀ and ∃ are called quantifiers because they refer in some
sense to the quantity (i.e., all or some) of the variable that follows them. The
symbol ∀ is called the universal quantifier and ∃ is called the existential
quantifier. Statements containing them are called quantified statements.
A statement beginning with ∀ is called a universally quantified statement, and one beginning with ∃ is called an existentially quantified
statement.
Example 2.5 The following English statements are paired with their
translations into symbolic form.
Every integer that is not odd is even.
∀ n ∈ Z, ∼ (n is odd ) ⇒ (n is even), or

∀ n ∈ Z, ∼ O(n) ⇒ E(n).

There is an integer that is not even.
∃ n ∈ Z, ∼ E(n).
For every real number x, there is a real number y for which y3 = x.
∀ x ∈ R, ∃ y ∈ R, y3 = x.
Given any two rational numbers a and b, the product ab is rational.
∀ a, b ∈ Q, ab ∈ Q.
Given a set X (such as, but not limited to, N, Z, Q, etc.), a quantified
statement of form ∀ x ∈ X , P(x) is understood to be true if P(x) is true for every
x ∈ X . If there is at least one x ∈ X for which P(x) is false, then ∀ x ∈ X , P(x)
is a false statement. Similarly, ∃ x ∈ X , P(x) is true provided that P(x) is true
for at least one element x ∈ X ; otherwise it is false. Thus each statement in
Example 2.5 is true. Here are some examples of quantified statements that
are false:
Example 2.6 The following false quantified statements are paired with
their translations.
Every integer is even.
∀ n ∈ Z, E(n).

There is an integer n for which n2 = 2.
∃ n ∈ Z, n2 = 2.
For every real number x, there is a real number y for which y2 = x.
∀ x ∈ R, ∃ y ∈ R, y2 = x.
Given anyptwo rational numbers a and b, the number
∀ a, b ∈ Q, ab ∈ Q.

p

ab is rational.

Example 2.7 When a statement contains two quantifiers you must be
very alert to their order, for reversing the order can change the meaning.
Consider the following statement from Example 2.5.
∀ x ∈ R, ∃ y ∈ R, y3 = x.

This statement is true, for no matter what number x is there exists a number
p
y = 3 x for which y3 = x. Now reverse the order of the quantifiers to get the
new statement
∃ y ∈ R, ∀ x ∈ R, y3 = x.

This new statement says that there exists a particular number y with the
property that y3 = x for every real number x. Since no number y can have
this property, the statement is false. The two statements above have entirely
different meanings.
Quantified statements are often misused in casual conversation. Maybe
you’ve heard someone say “All students do not pay full tuition.” when they
mean “Not all students pay full tuition.” While the mistake is perhaps
marginally forgivable in casual conversation, it must never be made in a
mathematical context. Do not say “All integers are not even.” because that
means there are no even integers. Instead, say “Not all integers are even.”

2.8 More on Conditional Statements

It is time to address a very important point about conditional statements
that contain variables. To motivate this, let’s return to the following example
concerning integers x:
(x is a multiple of 6) ⇒ (x is even).

As noted earlier, since every multiple of 6 is even, this is a true statement
no matter what integer x is. We could even underscore this fact by writing
this true statement as
∀ x ∈ Z, (x is a multiple of 6) ⇒ (x is even).

But now switch things around to get the different statement
(x is even) ⇒ (x is a multiple of 6).

This is true for some values of x such as −6, 12, 18, etc., but false for others
(such as 2, 4, etc.). Thus we do not have a statement, but rather an open
sentence. (Recall from Section 2.1 that an open sentence is a sentence
whose truth value depends on the value of a certain variable or variables.)
However, by putting a universal quantifier in front we get
∀ x ∈ Z, (x is even) ⇒ (x is a multiple of 6),

which is definitely false, so this new expression is a statement, not an open
sentence. In general, given any two open sentences P(x) and Q(x) about
integers x, the expression ∀ x ∈ Z, P(x) ⇒ Q(x) is either true or false, so it is
a statement, not an open sentence.
Now we come to the very important point. In mathematics, whenever
P(x) and Q(x) are open sentences concerning elements x in some set X
(depending on context), an expression of form P(x) ⇒ Q(x) is understood to be
the statement ∀ x ∈ X , P(x) ⇒ Q(x). In other words, if a conditional statement
is not explicitly quantified then there is an implied universal quantifier in
front of it. This is done because statements of the form ∀ x ∈ X , P(x) ⇒ Q(x)
are so common in mathematics that we would get tired of putting the ∀ x ∈ X
in front of them.
Thus the following sentence is a true statement (as it is true for all x).
If x is a multiple of 6, then x is even.

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

Translating English to Symbolic Logic

57

Likewise, the next sentence is a false statement (as it is not true for all x).
If x is even, then x is a multiple of 6.
This leads to the following significant interpretation of a conditional
statement, which is more general than (but consistent with) its definition
in Section 2.3.
Definition 2.2 If P and Q are statements or open sentences, then
“If P , then Q ,”
is a statement. This statement is true if it’s impossible for P to be true
while Q is false. It is false if there is at least one instance in which P is
true but Q is false.
Thus the following are true statements:
If x ∈ R, then x2 + 1 > 0.
If a function f is differentiable on R, then f is continuous on R.
Likewise, the following are false statements:
If p is a prime number, then p is odd.
If f is a rational function, then f has an asymptote.

(2 is prime.)
( x2 is rational.)

2.9 Translating English to Symbolic Logic
In writing (and reading) proofs of theorems, we must always be alert to the
logical structure and meanings of the sentences. Sometimes it is necessary
or helpful to parse them into expressions involving logic symbols. This may
be done mentally or on scratch paper, or occasionally even explicitly within
the body of a proof. The purpose of this section is to give you sufficient
practice in translating English sentences into symbolic form so that you
can better understand their logical structure. Here are some examples:
Example 2.8

Consider the Mean Value Theorem from Calculus:

If f is continuous on the interval [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then
f ( a)
there is a number c ∈ (a, b) for which f 0 (c) = f (bb)−
−a .
Here is a translation to symbolic form:

Example 2.9 Consider Goldbach’s conjecture, from Section 2.1:
Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.

This can be translated in the following ways, where P is the set of prime
numbers and X = {4, 6, 8, 10, . . .} is the set of even integers greater than 2.
¡

¢ ¡
¢
n ∈ X ⇒ ∃ p, q ∈ P, n = p + q

∀ n ∈ X , ∃ p, q ∈ P, n = p + q

These translations of Goldbach’s conjecture illustrate an important point.
The first has the basic structure (n ∈ X ) ⇒ Q(n) and the second has structure
∀ n ∈ X , Q(n), yet they have exactly the same meaning. This is significant.
Every universally quantified statement can be expressed as a conditional
statement.
Fact 2.2 Suppose X is a set and Q(x) is a statement about x for each
x ∈ X . The following statements mean the same thing:
∀ x ∈ X , Q(x)
(x ∈ X ) ⇒ Q(x).

This fact is significant because so many theorems have the form of
a conditional statement. (The Mean Value Theorem is an example.) In
proving a theorem we have to think carefully about what it says. Sometimes
a theorem will be expressed as a universally quantified statement, but it will
be more convenient to think of it as a conditional statement. Understanding
the above fact allows us to switch between the two forms.
The section closes with some final points. In translating a statement,
be attentive to its intended meaning. Don’t jump into, for example, automatically replacing every “and” with ∧ and “or” with ∨. An example:
At least one of the integers x and y is even.
Don’t be led astray by the presence of the word “and.” The meaning of
the statement is that one or both of the numbers is even, so it should be
translated with “or,” not “and”:
( x is even) ∨ ( y is even).
Finally, the logical meaning of “but” can be captured by “and.” The
sentence “The integer x is even, but the integer y is odd,” is translated as
( x is even) ∧ ( y is odd).

2.10 Negating Statements
Given a statement R , the statement ∼ R is called the negation of R . If R is
a complex statement, then it is often the case that its negation ∼ R can be
written in a simpler or more useful form. The process of finding this form
is called negating R . In proving theorems it is often necessary to negate
certain statements. We now investigate how to do this.
We have already examined part of this topic. DeMorgan’s laws
∼ (P ∧ Q) = (∼ P) ∨ (∼ Q)

(2.6)

∼ (P ∨ Q) = (∼ P) ∧ (∼ Q)

(2.7)

(from Section 2.6) can be viewed as rules that tell us how to negate the
statements P ∧ Q and P ∨ Q . Here are some examples that illustrate how
DeMorgan’s laws are used to negate statements involving “and” or “or.”

Logic

Example 2.10

Consider negating the following statement.

R : You can solve it by factoring or with the quadratic formula.

Now, R means (You can solve it by factoring) ∨ (You can solve it with Q.F.),
which we will denote as P ∨ Q . The negation of this is
∼ (P ∨ Q) = (∼ P) ∧ (∼ Q).

Therefore, in words, the negation of R is
∼ R : You can’t solve it by factoring and you can’t solve it with

the quadratic formula.
Maybe you can find ∼ R without invoking DeMorgan’s laws. That is good;
you have internalized DeMorgan’s laws and are using them unconsciously.
Example 2.11

We will negate the following sentence.

R : The numbers x and y are both odd.

This statement means ( x is odd) ∧ ( y is odd), so its negation is
¡
¢
∼ (x is odd) ∧ (y is odd) = ∼ (x is odd) ∨ ∼ (y is odd)
= (x is even) ∨ (y is even).

Therefore the negation of R can be expressed in the following ways:
∼ R : The number x is even or the number y is even.
∼ R : At least one of x and y is even.

Now let’s move on to a slightly different kind of problem. It’s often
necessary to find the negations of quantified statements. For example,
consider ∼ (∀ x ∈ N, P(x)). Reading this in words, we have the following:
It is not the case that P(x) is true for all natural numbers x.
This means P(x) is false for at least one x. In symbols, this is ∃ x ∈ N, ∼ P(x).
Thus ∼ (∀ x ∈ N, P(x)) = ∃ x ∈ N, ∼ P(x). Similarly, you can reason out that
∼ (∃ x ∈ N, P(x)) = ∀ x ∈ N, ∼ P(x). In general:
¡
¢
∼ ∀ x ∈ X , P(x) = ∃ x ∈ X , ∼ P(x),
¡
¢
∼ ∃ x ∈ X , P(x) = ∀ x ∈ X , ∼ P(x).

Be sure that you understand these two logical equivalences. They conform
to our everyday use of language, but they pin down the meaning in a
mathematically precise way.

Negating Statements
Example 2.12

61

Consider negating the following statement.

R : The square of every real number is non-negative.

Symbolically, R can be expressed as ∀ x ∈ R, x2 ≥ 0, and thus its negation is
∼ (∀ x ∈ R, x2 ≥ 0) = ∃ x ∈ R, ∼ (x2 ≥ 0) = ∃ x ∈ R, x2 < 0. In words, this is
∼ R : There exists a real number whose square is negative.

Observe that R is true and ∼ R is false. Maybe you can get ∼ R immediately,
without using Equation (2.8) as we did above. If so, that is good; if not, you
should be there soon.
Example 2.13 If a statement has multiple quantifiers, negating it involves
several iterations of Equations (2.8) and (2.9). Consider the following:
S : For every real number x there is a real number y for which y3 = x.

This statement asserts any real number x has a cube root y, so it’s true.
Symbolically S can be expressed as
∀ x ∈ R, ∃ y ∈ R, y3 = x.

Let’s work out the negation of this statement.
∼ (∀ x ∈ R, ∃ y ∈ R, y3 = x) = ∃ x ∈ R, ∼ (∃ y ∈ R, y3 = x)
= ∃ x ∈ R, ∀ y ∈ R, ∼ (y3 = x)
= ∃ x ∈ R, ∀ y ∈ R, y3 6= x.

Thus the negation is a (false) statement that can be written in either of the
following ways.
∼ S : There is a real number x such that for all real numbers y, y3 6= x.
∼ S : There is a real number x for which y3 6= x for all real numbers y.

In writing proofs you will occasionally have to negate a conditional
statement P ⇒ Q . The remainder of this section describes how to do this.
To begin, look at the expression ∼ (P ⇒ Q), which literally says “P ⇒ Q is
false.” You know from the truth table for ⇒ that the only way that P ⇒ Q
can be false is if P is true and Q is false. Therefore
∼ (P ⇒ Q) = P ∧ ∼ Q.

(2.10)

(In fact, in Exercise 12 of Section 2.6, you used a truth table to verify that
these two statements are indeed logically equivalent.)

Example 2.14 Negate the following statement about a particular (i.e.,
constant) number a.
R : If a is odd then a2 is odd.

Using Equation (2.10), we get the following negation.
∼ R : a is odd and a2 is not odd.

Example 2.15 This example is like the previous one, but the constant a
is replaced by a variable x. We will negate the following statement.
R : If x is odd then x2 is odd.

As in Section 2.8, we interpret this as the universally quantified statement
R : ∀ x ∈ Z, (x odd) ⇒ (x2 odd).

By Equations (2.8) and (2.10), we get the following negation for R .
¡
¢
¡
¢
∼ ∀ x ∈ Z, (x odd) ⇒ (x2 odd) = ∃ x ∈ Z, ∼ (x odd) ⇒ (x2 odd)

= ∃ x ∈ Z, (x odd)∧ ∼ (x2 odd).

Translating back into words, we have
∼ R : There is an odd integer x whose square is not odd.

Notice that R is true and ∼ R is false.
The above Example 2.15 showed how to negate a conditional statement
P(x) ⇒ Q(x). This type of problem can sometimes be embedded in more
complex negation. See Exercise 5 below (and its solution).
Exercises for Section 2.10

3. For every prime number p, there is another prime number q with q > p.
4. For every positive number ε, there is a positive number δ such that | x − a| < δ

5. For every positive number ε, there is a positive number M for which | f ( x) − b| < ε

2.11 Logical Inference
Suppose we know that a conditional statement P ⇒ Q is true. This tells us
that whenever P is true, Q will also be true. By itself, P ⇒ Q being true does
not tell us that either P or Q is true (they could both be false, or P could
be false and Q true). But if in addition we happen to know that P is true,
then Q must be true. This is called a logical inference: From two true
statements we infer that a third statement is true. In essence, statements
P ⇒ Q and P are “added together” to get Q . We can indicate this by stacking
P ⇒ Q and P one atop the other with a line separating them from Q . The
intended meaning is that P ⇒ Q combined with P produces Q .
P ⇒Q
P
Q

This is a very frequently-used pattern of thought. (In fact, it is exactly the
pattern we used in the example on page 34.) This rule even has a name. It
is called the modus ponens rule.
Two other logical inferences, called modus tollens and elimination
are listed below. In each case you should convince yourself (based on your
knowledge of the relevant truth tables) that the truth of the statements
above the line forces the statement below the line to be true.
Modus Ponens

It is important to internalize these rules. (You already use at least modus
ponens and elimination in daily life anyway.) But you need not remember
their names; few mathematicians can recall the names, though they use
the rules constantly. The names are not important, but the rules are.

Three additional logical inferences are listed below. The first states the
obvious fact that if P and Q are both true, then so is the statement P ∧ Q .
On the other hand, P ∧ Q being true forces P (also Q ) to be true. Finally, if
P is true, then P ∨ Q must be true, no matter what statement Q is.

These inferences are so intuitively obvious that they scarcely need to be
mentioned. However, they represent certain patterns of reasoning that we
will frequently apply to sentences in proofs, so we should be cognizant of
the fact that we are using them.
2.12 An Important Note
It is important to be aware of the reasons that we study logic. There are
three very significant reasons. First, the truth tables we studied tell us the
exact meanings of the words such as “and,” “or,” “not” and so on. For instance,
whenever we use or read the “If..., then” construction in a mathematical
context, logic tells us exactly what is meant. Second, the rules of inference
provide a system in which we can produce new information (statements)
from known information. Finally, logical rules such as DeMorgan’s laws
help us correctly change certain statements into (potentially more useful)
statements with the same meaning. Thus, logic helps us understand the
meanings of statements, and it also produces new meaningful statements.
Logic is the glue that holds strings of statements together and pins down
the exact meaning of certain key phrases such as the “If..., then” or “For
all” constructions. Logic is the common language that all mathematicians
use, so we must have a firm grip on it in order to write and understand
mathematics.
But despite its fundamental role, logic’s place is in the background of
what we do, not the forefront. From here on, the beautiful symbols ∧, ∨,
⇒, ⇔, ∼, ∀ and ∃ are rarely written. But we are aware of their meanings
constantly. When reading or writing a sentence involving mathematics we
parse it with these symbols, either mentally or on scratch paper, so as to
understand the true and unambiguous meaning.

CHAPTER 3

Counting

t may seem peculiar that a college-level text has a chapter on counting.
At its most basic level, counting is a process of pointing to each object
in a collection and calling off “one, two, three,...” until the quantity of
objects is determined. How complex could that be? Actually, counting
can become quite subtle, and in this chapter we explore some of its more
sophisticated aspects. Our goal is still to answer the question “How many?”
but we introduce mathematical techniques that bypass the actual process of
counting individual objects. Sets play a big role in our discussions because
the things we need to count are often naturally grouped together into a set.
The concept of a list is also extremely useful.

I

3.1 Lists
A list is an ordered sequence of objects. A list is denoted by an opening
parenthesis, followed by the objects, separated by commas, followed by a
closing parenthesis. For example (a, b, c, d, e) is a list consisting of the first
five letters of the English alphabet, in order. The objects a, b, c, d, e are called
the entries of the list; the first entry is a, the second is b, and so on. If the
entries are rearranged we get a different list, so, for instance,
(a, b, c, d, e) 6= (b, a, c, d, e).

A list is somewhat like a set, but instead of being a mere collection of objects,
the entries of a list have a definite order. For sets we have
©

ª ©
ª
a, b, c, d, e = b, a, c, d, e ,

but—as noted above—the analogous equality for lists does not hold.
Unlike sets, lists can have repeated entries. Thus (5, 3, 5, 4, 3, 3) is a
perfectly acceptable list, as is (S, O, S). The length of a list is its number of
entries. So (5, 3, 5, 4, 3, 3) has length six, and (S, O, S) has length three.

Counting

66

For more examples, (a, 15) is a list of length two. And (0, (0, 1, 1)) is a list
of length two whose second entry is a list of length three. Two lists are
equal if they have exactly the same entries in exactly the same positions.
Thus equal lists have the same number of entries. If two lists have different
lengths, then they can not be equal. Thus (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) 6= (0, 0, 0, 0, 0). Also
( g, r, o, c, e, r, y, l, i, s, t )

6=

¡

bread
milk
eggs
bananas
coffee

¢

because the list on the left has length eleven but the list on the right has
just one entry (a piece of paper with some words on it).
There is one very special list which has no entries at all. It is called the
empty list and is denoted ( ). It is the only list whose length is zero.
For brevity we often write lists without parentheses, or even commas.
For instance, we may write (S, O, S) as SOS if there is no risk of confusion.
But be alert that doing this can lead to ambiguity: writing (9, 10, 11) as
9 10 11 may cause us to confuse it with (9, 1, 0, 1, 1). Here it’s best to retain
the parenthesis/comma notation or at least write the list as 9, 10, 11. A list
of symbols written without parentheses and commas is called a string.
The process of tossing a coin ten times may be described by a string such
as HHT HTTT HHT . Tossing it twice could lead to any of the outcomes HH ,
HT , T H or TT . Tossing it zero times is described by the empty list ( ).
Imagine rolling a dice five times and recording the outcomes. This might
¡
¢
be described by the list , , , , , meaning that you rolled first, then
, then , etc. We might abbreviate this list as
, or 3, 5, 3, 1, 6.
Now imagine rolling a pair of dice, one white and one black. A typical
©
ª
outcome might be modeled as a set like
, . Rolling the pair six times
might be described with a list of six such outcomes:

We might abbreviate this list as

We study lists because many real-world phenomena can be described
and understood in terms of them. Your phone number can be identified
as a list of ten digits. (Order is essential, for rearranging the digits can
produce a different phone number.) A byte is another important example
of a list. A byte is simply a length-eight list of 0’s and 1’s. The world of
information technology revolves around bytes. And the examples above
show that multi-step processes (such as rolling a dice twice) can be modeled
as lists.
We now explore methods of counting or enumerating lists and processes.

The Multiplication Principle

67

3.2 The Multiplication Principle
Many practical problems involve counting the number of possible lists that
satisfy some condition or property.
For example, suppose we make a list of length three having the property
©
ª
that the first entry must be an element of the set a, b, c , the second entry
©
ª
©
ª
must be in 5, 7 and the third entry must be in a, x . Thus (a, 5, a) and
(b, 5, a) are two such lists. How many such lists are there all together? To
answer this question, imagine making the list by selecting the first entry,
then the second and finally the third. This is described in Figure 3.1. The
choices for the first list entry are a, b or c, and the left of the diagram
branches out in three directions, one for each choice. Once this choice is
made there are two choices (5 or 7) for the second entry, and this is described
graphically by two branches from each of the three choices for the first entry.
This pattern continues for the choice for the third entry, which is either
a or x. Thus, in the diagram there are 3 · 2 · 2 = 12 paths from left to right,
each corresponding to a particular choice for each entry in the list. The
corresponding lists are tallied at the far-right end of each path. So, to
answer our original question, there are 12 possible lists with the stated
properties.

Figure 3.1. Constructing lists of length 3
In the above example there are 3 choices for the first entry, 2 choices for
the second entry, and 2 for the third, and the total number of possible lists
is the product of choices 3 · 2 · 2 = 12. This kind of reasoning is an instance of
what we will call the multiplication principle. We will do one more example
before stating this important idea.

Consider making a list of length 4 from the four letters a, b, c, d , where
the list is not allowed to have a repeated letter. For example, abcd and cadb
are allowed, but aabc and cacb are not allowed. How many such lists are
there?
Let’s analyze this question with a tree representing the choices we have
for each list entry. In making such a list we could start with the first entry:
we have 4 choices for it, namely a, b, c or d , and the left side of the tree
branches out to each of these choices. But once we’ve chosen a letter for
the first entry, we can’t use that letter in the list again, so there are only 3
choices for the second entry. And once we’ve chosen letters for the first and
second entries we can’t use these letters in the third entry, so there are just
2 choices for it. By the time we get to the fourth entry we are forced to use
whatever letter we have left; there is only 1 choice.
The situation is described fully in the below tree showing how to make
all allowable lists by choosing 4 letters for the first entry, 3 for the second
entry, 2 for the third entry and 1 for the fourth entry. We see that the total
number of lists is the product 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24.

The Multiplication Principle

69

These trees show that the number of lists constructible by some specified
process equals the product of the numbers of choices for each list entry. We
summarize this kind of reasoning as an important fact.
Fact 3.1 (Multiplication Principle) Suppose in making a list of
length n there are a 1 possible choices for the first entry, a 2 possible
choices for the second entry, a 3 possible choices for the third entry, and
so on. Then the total number of different lists that can be made this way
is the product a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · · · · a n .
In using the multiplication principle you do not need to draw a tree
with a 1 · a 2 · · · · · a n branches. Just multiply the numbers!
Example 3.1 A standard license plate consists of three letters followed
by four numbers. For example, JRB-4412 and MMX-8901 are two standard
license plates. How many different standard license plates are possible?
Solution: A license plate such as JRB-4412 corresponds to a length-7 list
(J, R, B, 4, 4, 1, 2), so we just need to count how many such lists are possible.
We use the multiplication principle. There are a 1 = 26 possibilities (one for
each letter of the alphabet) for the first entry of the list. Similarly, there are
a 2 = 26 possibilities for the second entry and a 3 = 26 possibilities for the third.
There are a 4 = 10 possibilities for the fourth entry. Likewise a 5 = a 6 = a 7 = 10.
So there is a total of a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · a 4 · a 5 · a 6 · a 7 = 26 · 26 · 26 · 10 · 10 · 10 · 10 =
175,760,000 possible standard license plates.
Example 3.2 In ordering a café latte, you have a choice of whole, skim or
soy milk; small, medium or large; and either one or two shots of espresso.
How many choices do you have in ordering one drink?
Solution: Your choice is modeled by a list of form (milk, size, shots). There
are 3 choices for the first entry, 3 for the second and 2 for the third. By the
multiplication principle, the number of choices is 3 · 3 · 2 = 18.
There are two types of list-counting problems. On one hand, there are
situations in which list entries can be repeated, as in license plates or
telephone numbers. The sequence CCX-4144 is a perfectly valid license
plate in which the symbols C and 4 appear more than once. On the other
hand, for some lists repeated symbols do not make sense or are not allowed,
as in the (milk, size, shots) list from Example 3.2. We say repetition is
allowed in the first type of list and repetition is not allowed in the second
kind of list. (We will call a list in which repetition is not allowed a nonrepetitive list.) The next example illustrates the difference.

Example 3.3 Consider lists of length 4 made with symbols A, B, C, D, E, F,G .
(a) How many such lists are possible if repetition is allowed?
(b) How many such lists are possible if repetition is not allowed?
(c) How many are there if repetition is not allowed and the list has an E ?
(d) How many are there if repetition is allowed and the list has an E?
Solutions:
(a) Imagine the list as containing four boxes that we fill with selections
from the letters A, B, C, D, E, F and G, as illustrated below.

(

,

)

7 choices
7 choices
7 choices
7 choices

We have 7 choices in filling each box. The multiplication principle says
the total number of lists that can be made this way is 7 · 7 · 7 · 7 = 2401.
(b) This problem is the same as the previous one except that repetition
is not allowed. We have seven choices for the first box, but once it is
filled we can no longer use the symbol that was placed in it. Hence
there are only six possibilities for the second box. Once the second
box has been filled we have used up two of our letters, and there are
only five left to choose from in filling the third box. Finally, when the
third box is filled we have only four possible letters for the last box.

(

)

7 choices
6 choices
5 choices
4 choices

Thus there are 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 = 840 lists in which repetition does not occur.
(c) We are asked to count the length-4 lists in which repetition is not
allowed and the symbol E must appear somewhere in the list. Thus E
occurs once and only once in each list. Let us divide these lists into
four categories depending on whether the E occurs as the first, second,
third or fourth entry. These four types of lists are illustrated below.

The Multiplication Principle

71

Consider lists of the first type, in which the E appears in the first
entry. We have six remaining choices (A, B, C, D, F or G) for the second
entry, five choices for the third entry and four choices for the fourth
entry. Hence there are 6 · 5 · 4 = 120 lists having an E in the first entry.
As shown above, there are also 6 · 5 · 4 = 120 lists having an E in the
second, third or fourth entry. So there are 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 480
lists with exactly one E.
(d) Now we seek the number of length-4 lists where repetition is allowed
and the list must contain an E. Here is our strategy: By Part (a) of
this exercise there are 7 · 7 · 7 · 7 = 74 = 2401 lists with repetition allowed.
Obviously this is not the answer to our current question, for many of
these lists contain no E. We will subtract from 2401 the number of
lists that do not contain an E. In making a list that does not contain
an E, we have six choices for each list entry (because we can choose
any one of the six letters A, B, C, D, F or G). Thus there are 6 · 6 · 6 · 6 =
64 = 1296 lists without an E. So the answer to our question is that
there are 2401 − 1296 = 1105 lists with repetition allowed that contain
at least one E.
Before moving on from Example 3.3, let’s address an important point.
Perhaps you wondered if Part (d) could be solved in the same way as Part (c).
Let’s try doing it that way. We want to count the length-4 lists (repetition
allowed) that contain at least one E. The following diagram is adapted from
Part (c). The only difference is that there are now seven choices in each slot
because we are allowed to repeat any of the seven letters.

We get a total of 73 + 73 + 73 + 73 = 1372 lists, an answer that is larger
than the (correct) value of 1105 from our solution to Part (d) above. It is
easy to see what went wrong. The list (E, E, A, B) is of type 1 and type 2,
so it got counted twice. Similarly (E, E, C, E) is of type 1, 2 and 4, so it got
counted three times. In fact, you can find many similar lists that were
counted multiple times. In solving counting problems, we must always be
careful to avoid this kind of double-counting or triple-counting, or worse.

The next section presents two new counting principles that codify the
kind of thinking we used in parts (c) and (d) above. Combined with the
multiplication principle, they solve complex counting problems in ways that
avoid the pitfalls of double counting. But first, one more example of the
multiplication principle highlights another pitfall to be alert to.
Example 3.4 A non-repetitive list of length 5 is to be made from the
symbols A , B, C , D , E , F , G . The first entry must be either a B, C or D , and
the last entry must be a vowel. How many such lists are possible?
Solution: Start by making a list of five boxes. The first box must contain
either B, C or D , so there are three choices for it.

(

,

,

,

,

)

3 choices

Now there are 6 letters left for the remaining 4 boxes. The knee-jerk action
is to fill them in, one at a time, using up an additional letter each time.

(

,

,

,

,

)

3 choices
6 choices
5 choices
4 choices

But when we get to the last box, there is a problem. It is supposed to
contain a vowel, but for all we know we have already used up one or both
vowels in the previous boxes. The multiplication principle breaks down
because there is no way to tell how many choices there are for the last box.
The correct way to solve this problem is to fill in the first and last boxes
(the ones that have restrictions) first.

(

2 choices

Then fill the remaining middle boxes with the 5 remaining letters.

By the multiplication principle, there are 3 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 = 360 lists.
The new principles to be introduced in the next section are usually used
in conjunction with the multiplication principle. So work a few exercises
now to test your understanding of it.

3.3 The Addition and Subtraction Principles

We now discuss two new counting principles, the addition and subtraction
principles. Actually, they are not entirely new—you’ve used them intuitively
for years. Here we give names to these two fundamental thought patterns,
and phrase them in the language of sets. Doing this helps us recognize when
we are using them, and, more importantly, it helps us see new situations in
which they can be used.
The addition principle simply asserts that if a set can be broken into
pieces, then the size of the set is the sum of the sizes of the pieces.
Fact 3.2 (Addition Principle)
Suppose a finite set X can be decomposed
as a union X = X ∪ X ∪ · · · ∪ X n ,
¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ 1 ¯2 ¯
where X i ∩ X j = ; whenever i 6= j . Then ¯ X ¯ = ¯ X 1 ¯ + ¯ X 2 ¯ + · · · + ¯ X n ¯.

In our first example we will rework an instance where we used the
addition principle naturally, without comment: in Part (c) of Example 3.3.
Example 3.5 How many length-4 non-repetitive lists can be made from
the symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G, if the list must contain an E?
In Example 3.3 (c) our approach was to divide these lists into four types,
depending on whether the E is in the first, second, third or fourth position.
Type 1

Type 2

E

Type 3

E
6 5 4

Type 4

Then we used the multiplication principle to count the lists of type 1.
There are 6 choices for the second entry, 5 for the third, and 4 for the fourth.
This is indicated above, where the number below a box is the number of
choices we have for that position. The multiplication principle implies that
there are 6 · 5 · 4 = 120 lists of type 1. Similarly there are 6 · 5 · 4 = 120 lists of
types 2, 3, and 4.

The Addition and Subtraction Principles

75

We then used the addition principle intuitively, conceiving of the lists to be
counted as the elements of a set X , broken up into parts X 1 , X 2 , X 3 and X 4 ,
which are the lists of types 1 ,2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The addition principle says that the number of lists that contain an E is
| X | = | X 1 | + | X 2 | + | X 3 | + | X 4 | = 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 480.
We use the addition principle when we need to count the things in some
set X . If we can find a way to break X up as X = X 1 ∪ X 2 ∪· · ·∪ X n , where each
X i is easier to count than X , then the addition principle gives an answer of
| X | = | X 1 | + | X 2 | + | X 3 | + · · · + | X n |.
But for this to work the intersection of any two pieces X i must be ;,
as stated in Fact 3.2. For instance, if X 1 and X 2 shared an element, then
that element would be counted once in | X 1 | and again in | X 2 |, and we’d
get | X | < | X 1 | + | X 2 | + · · · + | X n |. (This is precisely the double counting issue
mentioned after Example 3.3.)
Example 3.6 How many even 5-digit numbers are there for which no
digit is 0, and the digit 6 appears exactly once? For instance, 55634 and
16118 are such numbers, but not 63304 (has a 0), nor 63364 (too many 6’s),
nor 55637 (not even).
Solution: Let X be the set of all such numbers. The answer will be | X |, so
our task is to find | X |. Put X = X 1 ∪ X 2 ∪ X 3 ∪ X 4 ∪ X 5 , where X i is the set of
those numbers in X whose i th digit is 6, as diagramed below. Note X i ∩ X j = ;
whenever i 6= j because the numbers in X i have their 6 in a different position
than the numbers in X j . Our plan is to use the multiplication principle to
compute each | X i |, and follow this with the addition principle.

The first digit of any number in X 1 is 6, and the three digits following it
can be any of the ten digits except 0 (not allowed) or 6 (already appears).
Thus there are eight choices for each of three digits following the first 6.
But because any number in X 1 is even, its final digit must be one of 2,4
or 8, so there are just three choices for this final digit. By the multiplication
principle, | X 1 | = 8 · 8 · 8 · 3 = 1536. Likewise | X 2 | = | X 3 | = | X 4 | = 8 · 8 · 8 · 3 = 1536.
But X 5 is slightly different because we do not choose the final digit,
which is already 6. The multiplication principle gives | X 5 | = 8 · 8 · 8 · 8 = 4096.
The addition principle gives our final answer. The number of even 5digit numbers with no 0’s and one 6 is | X | = | X 1 | + | X 2 | + | X 3 | + | X 4 | + | X 5 | =
1536 + 1536 + 1536 + 1536 + 4096 = 10,240.

Now we introduce our next counting
U
method, the subtraction principle. To set
it up, imagine that a set X is a subset of a
X
universal set U , as shown on the right.
U−X
The complement X = U − X is shaded.
Suppose we wanted to count the things
in this shaded region. Surely this is the number
of things in U minus
¯
¯
¯
¯
the number of things in X , which is to say U − X = |U | − | X |. That is the
subtraction principle.
Fact 3.3 (Subtraction Principle) ¯ ¯
¯ X ¯ = |U | − | X |.
If X is a subset of a finite set U
, then
¯
¯
In other words, if X ⊆ U then ¯U − X ¯ = |U | − | X |.
The subtraction principle is used in situations where it is easier to count
the things in some set U that we wish to exclude from consideration than
it is to count those things that are included. We have seen this kind of
thinking before. We quietly and naturally used it in part (d) of Example 3.3.
For convenience we repeat that example now, casting it into the language
of the subtraction principle.
Example 3.7 How many length-4 lists can be made from the symbols
A, B, C, D, E, F, G if the list has at least one E , and repetition is allowed?
Solution: Such a list might contain one, two, three or four E ’s, which could
occur in various positions. This is a fairly complex situation.
But it is very easy to count the set U of all lists of length 4 made from
A, B, C, D, E, F, G if we don’t care whether or not the lists have any E ’s.
The multiplication principle says |U | = 7 · 7 · 7 · 7 = 2401.
It is equally easy to count the set X of those lists that contain no E ’s.
The multiplication principle says | X | = 6 · 6 · 6 · 6 = 1296.
We are interested in those lists that have at least one E , and this is
the set U − X . By the subtraction principle, the answer to our question is
|U − X | = |U | − | X | = 2401 − 1296 = 1105.
As we continue with counting we will have many opportunities to use
the multiplication, addition and subtraction principles. Usually these will
arise in the context of other counting principles that we have yet to explore.
It is thus important that you solidify the current ideas now, by working
some exercises before moving on.

3.4 Factorials and Permutations

In working examples from the previous two sections you may have noticed
that we often need to count the number of non-repetitive lists of length n
that are made from n symbols. This kind of problem occurs so often that a
special idea, called a factorial, is used to handle it.
The table below motivates this. The first column lists successive integer
©
ª
values n, from 0 onward. The second contains a set a, b, . . . of n symbols.
The third column shows all the possible non-repetitive lists of length n
that can be made from these symbols. Finally, the last column tallies up
how many lists there are of that type. When n = 0 there is only one list of
length 0 that can be made from 0 symbols, namely the empty list ( ). Thus
the value 1 is entered in the last column of that row.

For n > 0, the number that appears in the last column can be computed
using the multiplication principle. The number of non-repetitive lists of
length n that can be made from n symbols is n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1. Thus, for
instance, the number in the last column of the row for n = 4 is 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24.
The number that appears in the last column of Row n is called the
factorial of n. It is denoted with the special symbol n!, which we pronounce
as “n factorial." Here is the definition:
Definition 3.1 If n is a non-negative integer, then n! is the number of
lists of length n that can be made from n symbols, without repetition.
Thus 0! = 1 and 1! = 1. If n > 1, then n! = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1.

6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 720,

and so on.

Students are often tempted to say 0! = 0, but this is wrong. The correct
value is 0! = 1, as the above definition and table show. Here is another way
to see that 0! must equal 1: Notice that 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 5 · (4 · 3 · 2 · 1) = 5 · 4!.
Also 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 4 · (3 · 2 · 1) = 4 · 3!. Generalizing this, we get a formula.
n! = n · (n − 1)!

(3.1)

Plugging in n = 1 gives 1! = 1 · (1 − 1)! = 1 · 0!, that is, 1! = 1 · 0!. If we mistakenly
thought 0! were 0, this would give the incorrect result 1! = 0.
Example 3.8 This problem involves making lists of length seven from the
letters a, b, c, d, e, f and g.
(a) How many such lists are there if repetition is not allowed?
(b) How many such lists are there if repetition is not allowed and the first
two entries must be vowels?
(c) How many such lists are there in which repetition is allowed, and the
list must contain at least one repeated letter?
To answer the first question, note that there are seven letters, so the
number of lists is 7! = 5040. To answer the second question, notice that
©
ª
the set a, b, c, d, e, f, g contains two vowels and five consonants. Thus in
making the list the first two entries must be filled by vowels and the final
five must be filled with consonants. By the multiplication principle, the
number of such lists is 2 · 1 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 2!5! = 240.
To answer part (c) we use the subtraction principle. Let U be the set of all
lists made from a, b, c, d, e, f, g, with repetition allowed. The multiplication
principle gives |U | = 7 · 7 · 7 · 7 · 7 · 7 · 7 = 77 = 823, 543. Notice that U includes
lists that are non-repetitive, like (a,g,f,b,d,c,e), as well as lists that have
some repetition, like (f,g,b,g,a,a,a). We want to find the number of lists that
have at least one repeated letter, so we will subtract away from U all those
lists that have no repetition. Let X ⊆ U be those lists that have no repetition,
so | X | = 7!. Thus the answer to our question is |U − X | = |U | − | X | = 77 − 7! =
823, 543 − 5040 = 818, 503.

In part (a) of Example 3.8 we counted the number of non-repetitive lists
©
ª
made from all seven of the symbols in the set X = a, b, c, d, e, f, g , and
there were 7! = 5040 such lists. Any such list, such as bcedagf, gfedcba or
abcdefg is simply an arrangement of the elements of X in a row. There is a
name for such an arrangement. It is called a permutation of X .
A permutation of a set is an arrangement of all of the set’s elements
in a row, that is, a list without repetition that uses every element of the set.
©
ª
For example, the permutations of the set X = 1, 2, 3 are the six lists
123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.

That we get six different permutations of X is predicted by Definition 3.1,
which says there are 3! = 3 · 2 · 1 = 6 non-repetitive lists that can be made
from the three symbols in X .
Think of the numbers 1, 2 and 3 as representing three books. The above
shows that there are six ways to arrange them on a shelf.
From a deck of cards you take the four queens and lay them in a row.
By the multiplication principle there are 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24 ways to do this,
that is, there are 24 permutations of the set of four Queen cards.

4! = 24 permutations. The set a,b,c,d,e,f,g has 7! = 5040 permutations,

though there’s not much point in listing them all out. The important thing
is that the factorial counts the number of permutations.
In saying a permutation of a set is an arrangement of its elements in a
row, we are speaking informally because sometimes the elements are not
literally in a row. Imagine a classroom of 20 desks, in four rows of five desks
each. Let X be a class (set) of 20 students. If the students walk in and seat
themselves, one per desk, we can regard this as a permutation of the 20
students because we can number the desks 1, 2, 3, . . . , 20 and in this sense
the students have arranged themselves in a list of length 20. There are
20! = 2, 432, 902, 008, 176, 640, 000 permutations of the students.

Now we discuss a variation of the idea of a permutation of a set X .
Imagine taking some number k ≤ | X | of elements from the set X and then
arranging them in a row. The result is what we call a k-permutation of X .
A permutation of X is a non-repetitive list made from all elements of X .
A k-permutation of X is a non-repetitive list made from k elements of X .
©

ª

For example, take X = a, b, c, d . The 1-permutations of X are the lists
we could make with just one element from X . There are only 4 such lists:
a

b

c

d.

The 2-permutations of X are the non-repetitive lists that we could make
from two elements of X . There are 12 of them:
ab

ac

ad

ba

bc

bd

ca

cb

cd

da

db

dc.

Even before writing them all down, we’d know there are 12 of them because
in making a non-repetitive length-2 list from X we have 4 choices for the first
element, then 3 choices for the second, so by the multiplication principle
the total number of 2-permutations of X is 4 · 3 = 12.
Now let’s count the number of 3-permutations of X . They are the length3 non-repetitive lists made from elements of X . The multiplication principle
says there will be 4 · 3 · 2 = 24 of them. Here they are:

The 4-permutations of X are the non-repetitive lists made from all 4
elements of X . These are simply the 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24 permutations of X .
Let’s go back and think about the 0-permutations of X . They are the
non-repetitive lists of length 0 made from the elements of X . Of course
there is only one such list, namely the empty list ().
Now we are going to introduce some notation. The expression P(n, k)
denotes the number of k-permutations of an n-element set. By the examples
on this page we have P(4, 0) = 1, P(4, 1) = 4, P(4, 2) = 12, P(4, 3) = 24, and
P(4, 4) = 24.
What about, say, P(4, 5)? This is the number of 5-permutations of a
4-element set, that is, the number of non-repetitive length-5 lists that can
be made from 4 symbols. There is no such list, so P(4, 5) = 0.

If n > 0, then P(n, k) can be computed with the multiplication principle.
In making a non-repetitive length-k list from n symbols we have n choices
for the 1st entry, n − 1 for the 2nd, n − 2 for the 3rd, and n − 3 for the 4th.
1st

2nd 3rd

4th

5th

···

kth

···
n

( n −1)( n −2)( n −3)( n −4)

···

( n − k + 1)

Notice that the number of choices for the i th position is n − i + 1. For example,
the 5th position has n − 5 + 1 = n − 4 choices. Continuing in this pattern, the
last (kth) entry has n − k + 1 choices. Therefore
P(n, k) = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1).

(3.2)

All together there are k factors in this product, so to compute P(n, k) just
perform n(n − 1)(n − 2)(n − 3) · · · until you’ve multiplied k numbers. Examples:
P(10, 1)
P(10, 2)
P(10, 3)

10 · 9 · 8 · 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 · 0 = 0.

Note P(10, 11) = 0, as the 11th factor in the product is 0. This makes
sense because P(10, 11) is the number of non-repetitive length-11 lists made
from just 10 symbols. There are no such lists, so P(10, 11) = 0 is right. In
fact you can check that Equation (3.2) gives P(n, k) = 0 whenever k > n.
Also notice above that P(10, 10) = 10!. In general P(n, n) = n!.
We now derive another formula for P(n, k), one that works for 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
Using Equation (3.2) with cancellation and the definition of a factorial,
P(n, k) =
=

n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1)
n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1)(n − k)(n − k − 1) · · · 3 · 2 · 1
(n − k)(n − k − 1) · · · 3 · 2 · 1

=

n!
.
(n − k)!

To illustrate, let’s find P(8, 5) in two ways. Equation (3.2) says P(8, 5) =
8 · 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 = 6720. By the above formula, P(8, 5) =

We summarize these ideas in the following definition and fact.
Fact 3.4 A k-permutation of an n-element set is a non-repetitive
length- k list made from elements of the set. Informally we think of
a k-permutation as an arrangement of k of the set’s elements in a row.
The number of k-permutations of an n-element set is denoted P(n, k), and
P(n, k) = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1).

If 0 ≤ k ≤ n, then P(n, k) = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1) =

n!
.
(n − k)!

Notice that P(n, 0) = (n−n!0)! = nn!! = 1, which makes sense because only one
list of length 0 can be made from n symbols, namely the empty list. Also
1
P(0, 0) = (0−0!0)! = 0!
0! = 1 = 1, which is to be expected because there is only one
list of length 0 that can be made with 0 symbols, again the empty list.
Example 3.9 Ten contestants run a marathon. All finish, and there are
no ties. How many different possible rankings are there for first-, secondand third-place?
Solution: Call the contestants A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J . A ranking
of winners can be regarded as a 3-permutation of the set of 10 contestants.
For example, ECH means E in first-place, C in second-place and H in third.
Thus there are P(10, 3) = 10 · 9 · 8 = 720 possible rankings.
Example 3.10 You deal five cards off of a standard 52-card deck, and line
them up in a row. How many such lineups are there that either consist of
all red cards, or all clubs?
Solution: There are 26 red cards. The number of ways to line up five of
them is P(26, 5) = 26 · 25 · 24 · 23 · 22 = 7, 893, 600.
There are 13 club cards (which are black). The number of ways to line up
five of them is P(13, 5) = 13 · 12 · 11 · 10 · 9 = 154, 440.
By the addition principle, the answer to our question is that there are
P(26, 5) + P(13, 5) = 8, 048, 040 lineups that are either all red cards, or all club
cards.
Notice that we do not need to use the notation P(n, k) to solve the problems on this page. Straightforward applications of the multiplication and
addition principles would suffice. However, the P(n, k) notation often proves
to be a convenient shorthand.

Notice that this function provides a way of extending factorials to numbers other
than integers. Since Γ( n) = (n − 1)! for all n ∈ N, we have the formula n! = Γ(n + 1).
But Γ can be evaluated at any number in [0, ∞), not just at integers, so we have

3.5 Counting Subsets
The previous section dealt with counting lists made by selecting k entries
from a set of n elements. We turn now to a related question: How many
subsets can be made by selecting k elements from a set with n elements?
©
ª
To see the difference between these two problems, take A = a, b, c, d, e .
Consider the non-repetitive lists made from selecting two elements from A .
Fact 3.4 says there are P(5, 2) = 5 · 4 = 20 such lists, namely
(a, b), (a, c), (a, d), (a, e), (b, c), (b, d), (b, e), (c, d), (c, e), (d, e),
(b, a), (c, a), (d, a), (e, a), (c, b), (d, b), (e, b), (d, c), (e, c), (e, d).

But there are only ten 2-element subsets of A . They are

ª ©
ª ©
ª © ª ©
ª
a, b , a, c , a, d , a, e , b, c , b, d , b, e , c, d , c, e , d, e .

The reason that there are more lists than subsets is that changing the
order of the entries of a list produces a different list, but changing the order
of the elements of a set does not change the set. Using elements a, b ∈ A , we
©
ª
can make two lists (a, b) and (b, a), but only one subset a, b .
This section is concerned with counting subsets, not lists. As noted above,
the basic question is this: How many subsets can be made by choosing k
elements from an n-element set? We begin with some notation that gives a
name to the answer to this question.
Definition 3.2 If n and k are integers, then nk denotes the number of
subsets that can be made by choosing k elements from an n-element set.
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
We read nk as “ n choose k.” (Some textbooks write C(n, k) instead of nk .)
¡ ¢

This is illustrated in the following table that tallies the k-element subsets
©
ª
of the 4-element set A = a, b, c, d , for various values of k.

The values of k appear in the far-left column of the table. To the right of
each k are all of the subsets (if any) of A of size k. For example, when k = 1,
© ª © ª © ª
© ª
set A has four subsets of size k, namely a , b , c and d . Therefore
¡4¢
¡4¢
1 = 4. When k = 2 there are six subsets of size k so 2 = 6.
When k = 0, there is only one subset of A that has cardinality k, namely
¡ ¢
the empty set, ;. Therefore 40 = 1.
Notice that if k is negative or greater than | A |, then A has no subsets of
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
cardinality k, so 4k = 0 in these cases. In general nk = 0 whenever k < 0 or
¡ ¢
k > n. In particular this means nk = 0 if n is negative.
¡ ¢
Although it was not hard to work out the values of 4k by writing out
subsets in the above table, this method of actually listing sets would not
¡ ¢
be practical for computing nk when n and k are large. We need a formula.
¡ ¢
To find one, we will now carefully work out the value of 53 in a way that
¡ ¢
highlights a pattern that points the way to a formula for any nk .
¡5¢
©
ª
To begin, note that 3 is the number of 3-element subsets of a, b, c, d, e .
¡ ¢
These are listed in the top row of the table below, where we see 53 = 10.
The column under each subset tallies the 3! = 6 permutations of that subset.
©
ª
The first subset a, b, c has 3! = 6 permutations; these are listed below it.

The second column tallies the permutations of a, b, d , and so on.

The body of this table has 53 columns and 3! rows, so it has a total of
¡ ¢
3! 53 lists. But notice also that the table consists of every 3-permutation of
©
ª
a, b, c, d, e . Fact 3.4 says that there are P(5, 3) = (5−5!3)! such 3-permutations.
¡ ¢
Thus the total number of lists in the table can be written as either 3! 53 or

Solution: Making a 5-element subset of A with exactly two even elements
is a 2-step process. First select two of the four even elements from A .
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
There are 42 = 6 ways to do this. Next, there are 53 = 10 ways select three
of the five odd elements of A . By the multiplication principle, there are
¡4¢¡5¢
2 3 = 6 · 10 = 60 ways to select two even and three odd elements from A . So
there are 60 5-element subsets of A with exactly two even elements.

Example 3.15 A lottery features a bucket of 36 balls numbered 1 through
36. Six balls will be drawn randomly. For $1 you buy a ticket with six blanks:
ä ä ä ä ä ä . You fill in the blanks with six different numbers between 1
and 36. You win $1, 000, 000 if you chose the same numbers that are drawn,
regardless of order. What are your chances of winning?
Solution: In filling out the ticket you are choosing six numbers from a set of
¡ ¢
36!
36 numbers. Thus there are 36
6 = 6!(36−6)! = 1, 947, 792 different combinations
of numbers you might write. Only one of these will be a winner. Your
chances of winning are one in 1, 947, 792.
Example 3.16 How many 7-digit binary strings (0010100, 1101011, etc.)
have an odd number of 1’s?
Solution: Let A be the set of all 7-digit binary strings with an odd number
of 1’s, so the answer will be | A |. To find | A |, we break A into smaller parts.
Notice any string in A will have either one, three, five or seven 1’s. Let A 1 be
the set of 7-digit binary strings with only one 1. Let A 3 be the set of 7-digit
binary strings with three 1’s. Let A 5 be the set of 7-digit binary strings with
five 1’s, and let A 7 be the set of 7-digit binary strings with seven 1’s. Then
A = A 1 ∪ A 3 ∪ A 5 ∪ A 7 . Any two of the sets A i have empty intersection, so the
addition principle gives | A | = | A 1 | + | A 3 | + | A 5 | + | A 7 |.
Now we must compute the individual terms of this sum. Take A 3 , the
set of 7-digit binary strings with three 1’s. Such a string can be formed by
selecting three out of seven positions for the 1’s and putting 0’s in the other
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
spaces. Thus | A 3 | = 73 . Similarly | A 1 | = 71 , | A 5 | = 75 , and | A 7 | = 77 .
Answer: | A | = | A 1 | + | A 3 | + | A 5 | + | A 7 | = 71 + 73 + 75 + 77 = 7 + 35 + 21 + 1 = 64.
There are 64 7-digit binary strings with an odd number of 1’s.

3.6 Pascal’s Triangle and the Binomial Theorem

There are some beautiful and significant patterns among the numbers nk .
We now investigate a pattern based on one equation in particular. It happens
that

for any integers n and k with 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
¡ ¢
To see why this is true, notice that the left-hand side n+k 1 is the number
©
ª
of k-element subsets of the set A = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , n , which has n + 1 elements.
¡ ¢
Such a subset either contains 0 or it does not. The k−n 1 on the right is
the number of subsets of A that contain 0, because to make such a subset
© ª
we can start with 0 and append it an additional k − 1 numbers selected
©
ª
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
from 1, 2, 3, . . . , n , and there are k−n 1 ways to do this. Also, the nk on the
right is the number of subsets of A that do not contain 0, for it is the
©
ª
number of ways to select k elements from 1, 2, 3, . . . , n . In light of all this,
Equation (3.3) just states the obvious fact that the number of k-element
subsets of A equals the number of k-element subsets that contain 0 plus
the number of k-element subsets that do not contain 0.
Having seen why Equation (3.3) is true, we now highlight it by arranging
¡ ¢
the numbers nk in a triangular pattern. The left-hand side of Figure 3.3

shows the numbers nk arranged in a pyramid with 00 at the apex, just

This pattern is especially evident on the right of Figure 3.3, where each

worked out. Notice how 21 is the sum of the numbers 6 and 15 above
k
it. Similarly, 5 is the sum of the 1 and 4 above it and so on.
This arrangement is called Pascal’s triangle, after Blaise Pascal, 1623–
1662, a French philosopher and mathematician who discovered many of its
properties. We’ve shown only the first eight rows, but the triangle extends
downward forever. We can always add a new row at the bottom by placing
a 1 at each end and obtaining each remaining number by adding the two
numbers above its position. Doing this in Figure 3.3 (right) gives a new

The very top row (containing only 1) of Pascal’s triangle is called Row 0.

For now we will be content to accept the binomial theorem without proof.
(You will be asked to prove it in an exercise in Chapter 10.) You may find it
useful from time to time. For instance, you can use it if you ever need to
expand an expression such as (x + y)7 . To do this, look at Row 7 of Pascal’s
triangle in Figure 3.3 and apply the binomial theorem to get
(x + y)7 = x7 + 7x6 y + 21x5 y2 + 35x4 y3 + 35x3 y4 + 21x2 y5 + 7x y6 + y7 .

The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

93

3.7 The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
Many counting problems involve computing the cardinality of a union A ∪ B
of two finite sets. We examine this kind of problem now.
First we develop a formula for | A ∪ B|. It is tempting to say that | A ∪ B|
must equal | A | + |B|, but that is not quite right. If we count the elements of
A and then count the elements of B and add the two figures together, we
get | A | + |B|. But if A and B have some elements in common, then we have
counted each element in A ∩ B twice.

B

A

Therefore | A | + |B| exceeds | A ∪ B| by | A ∩ B|, and consequently | A ∪ B| =
| A | + |B| − | A ∩ B|. This can be a useful equation.
Fact 3.6 Inclusion-Exclusion Formula
If A and B are finite sets, then | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B|.
Notice that the sets A , B and A ∩ B are all generally smaller than A ∪ B,
so Fact 3.6 has the potential of reducing the problem of determining | A ∪ B|
to three simpler counting problems. It is called the inclusion-exclusion
formula because elements in A ∩ B are included (twice) in | A | + |B|, then
excluded when | A ∩ B| is subtracted. Notice that if A ∩ B = ;, then we do
in fact get | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B|. (This is an instance of the addition principle!)
Conversely, if | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B|, then it must be that A ∩ B = ;.
Example 3.17 A 3-card hand is dealt off of a standard 52-card deck. How
many different such hands are there for which all three cards are red or all
three cards are face cards?
Solution: Let A be the set of 3-card hands where all three cards are red
(i.e., either ♥ or ♦). Let B be the set of 3-card hands in which all three cards
are face cards (i.e., J,K or Q of any suit). These sets are illustrated below.

We seek the number of 3-card hands that are all red or all face cards, and
this number is | A ∪ B|. By Fact 3.6, | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B|. Let’s examine
| A |, |B| and | A ∩ B| separately. Any hand in A is formed by selecting three
¡ ¢
cards from the 26 red cards in the deck, so | A | = 26
3 . Similarly, any hand in
B is formed by selecting three cards from the 12 face cards in the deck, so
¡ ¢
|B| = 12
3 . Now think about A ∩ B. It contains all the 3-card hands made up
of cards that are red face cards.

Now we can answer our question. The number of 3-card hands that are

all red or all face cards is | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B| = 26
3 + 3 − 3 = 2600 +
220 − 20 = 2800.
Example 3.18 A 3-card hand is dealt off of a standard 52-card deck. How
many different such hands are there for which it is not the case that all 3
cards are red or all three cards are face cards?
Solution: We will use the subtraction principle combined with our answer
¡ ¢
52!
to Example 3.17, above. The total number of 3-card hands is 52
3 = 3!(52−3)! =
52!
52·51·50
= 26 · 17 · 50 = 22, 100. To get our answer, we must subtract from
3!49! =
3!
this the number of 3-card hands that are all red or all face cards, that is,
we must subtract the answer from Example 3.17. Thus the answer to our
question is 22, 100 − 2800 = 19,300.
There is an analogue of Fact 3.6 that involves three sets. Consider three
sets A , B and C , as represented in the following Venn Diagram.
C

A

B

Using the same kind of reasoning that resulted in Fact 3.6, you can convince
yourself that
| A ∪ B ∪ C | = | A | + | B | + | C | − | A ∩ B | − | A ∩ C | − | B ∩ C | + | A ∩ B ∩ C |.

3.8 Counting Multisets

You have in your pocket four pennies, two nickels, a dime and two quarters.
You might be tempted to regard this collection as a set
©
ª
1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 25, 25 .

But this is not a valid model of your collection of change, because a set
cannot have repeated elements. To overcome this difficulty, we make a new
construction called a multiset. A multiset is like a set, except that elements
©ª
can be repeated. We will use square brackets [ ] instead of braces to denote
multisets. For example, your multiset of change is
£
¤
1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 25, 25 .

A multiset is a hybrid of a set and a list; in a multiset, elements can be
repeated, but order does not matter. For instance
£
¤
£
¤
1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 25, 25 = 25, 5, 1, 1, 10, 1, 1, 5, 25
£
¤
= 25, 10, 25, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 1 .

Given a multiset A , its cardinality | A | is the number of elements it
£
¤
has, including repetition. So if A = 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 25, 25 , then | A | = 9. The
multiplicity of an element x ∈ A is the number of times that x appears, so
1 ∈ A has multiplicity 4, while 5 and 25 each have multiplicity 2, and 10 has
multiplicity 1. Notice that every set can be regarded as a multiset for which
each element has multiplicity 1. In this sense we can think of ; = {} = [] as
the multiset that has no elements.
To illustrate the idea of multisets, consider the multisets of cardinality 2
©
ª
that can be made from the symbols a, b, c, d . They are
[a, a] [a, b] [a, c] [a, d] [b, b] [b, c] [b, d] [c, c] [c, d] [d, d].

We have listed them so that the letters in each multiset are in alphabetical
order (remember, we can order the elements of a multiset in any way we
choose), and the 10 multisets are arranged in dictionary order.
©
ª
For multisets of cardinality 3 made from a, b, c, d , we have
[a, a, a] [a, a, b] [a, a, c] [a, a, d]
[a, b, c] [a, b, d] [a, c, c] [a, c, d]
[b, b, b] [b, b, c] [b, b, d] [b, c, c]
[b, d, d] [c, c, c] [c, c, d] [c, d, d]

Though X = a, b, c, d has no subsets of cardinality 5, there are many
multisets of cardinality 5 made from these elements, including [a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, b, c, d] and [b, c, c, d, d], and so on. Exactly how many are there?
This is the first question about multisets that we shall tackle: Given a
finite set X , how many cardinality-k multisets can be made from X ?
Let’s start by counting the cardinality-5 multisets made from symbols
©
ª
X = a, b, c, d . (Our approach will lead to a general formula.) We know we
can write any such multiset with its letters in alphabetical order. Tweaking
the notation slightly, we could write any such multiset with bars separating
the groupings of a, b, c, d , as shown in the table below. Notice that if a
symbol does not appear in the multiset, we still write the bar that would
have separated it from the others.

∗| ∗ | ∗ ∗|∗
∗ ∗ || ∗ ∗|∗
| ∗ ∗|| ∗ ∗∗
∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗|||

This suggests that we can encode the multisets as lists made from the two
symbols ∗ and |, with an ∗ for each element of the multiset, as follows.
∗ for each a

∗ for each b

∗ for each c

∗ for each d

z }| { ¯ z }| { ¯ z }| { ¯ z }| {
∗ ··· ··· ∗ ¯ ∗ ··· ··· ∗ ¯ ∗ ··· ··· ∗ ¯ ∗ ··· ··· ∗

For examples see the right-hand column of the table. Any such encoding is
a list made from 5 stars and 3 bars, so the list has a total of 8 entries. How
many such lists are there? We can form such a list by choosing 3 of the 8
positions for the bars, and filling the remaining three positions with stars.
¡ ¢
8!
Therefore the number of such lists is 83 = 3!5!
= 56.
That is our answer. There are 56 cardinality-5 multisets that can
be made from the symbols in X = {a, b, c, d }.
If we wanted to count the cardinality-3 multisets made from X , then the
exact same reasoning would apply, but with 3 stars instead of 5. We’d be
¡ ¢
6!
counting the length-6 lists with 3 stars and 3 bars. There are 63 = 3!3!
= 20
such lists. So there are 20 cardinality-3 multisets made from X = {a, b, c, d }.
This agrees with our accounting on the previous page.

Such a list has k stars (one for each element of the multiset) and n − 1
separating bars (a bar between each of the n groupings of stars). Therefore
its length is k + n − 1. We can make such a list by selecting n − 1 list positions
out of k + n − 1 positions for the bars and inserting stars in the left-over
¡
¢
positions. Thus there are k+n−n−1 1 such lists. Alternatively we could choose k
positions for the stars and fill in the remaining n − k with bars, so there are

¡

such lists. Note that k+kn−1 = k+n−n−1 1 by Equation (3.4) on page 91.

with k stars and n − 1 bars separating the n groupings of stars. Such a
list can be made by selecting n − 1 positions for the bars, and filling the
¡
¢
remaining positions with stars, and there are k+n−n−1 1 ways to do this.
For example, the number of 2-element multisets that can be made from
¡
¢ ¡ ¢
the 4-element set X = {a, b, c, d } is 2+42−1 = 52 = 10. This agrees with our
accounting of them on page 96. The number of 3-element multisets that
¡
¢ ¡ ¢
can be made from the elements of X is 3+43−1 = 63 = 20. Again this agrees
with our list of them on page 96.
¡
¢ ¡ ¢
The number of 1-element multisets made from X is 1+41−1 = 41 = 4.
Indeed, the four multisets are [a], [b], [c] and [d]. The number of 0-element

multisets made from X is 0+40−1 = 30 = 1. This is right, because there is
only one such multiset, namely ;.

Example 3.19 A bag contains 20 identical red marbles, 20 identical green
marbles, and 20 identical blue marbles. You reach in and grab 20 marbles.
There are many possible outcomes. You could have 11 reds, 4 greens and 5
blues. Or you could have 20 reds, 0 greens and 0 blues, etc. All together,
how many outcomes are possible?
Solution: Each outcome can be thought of as a 20-element multiset made
©
ª
from the elements of the 3-element set X = r,g,b . For example, 11 reds, 4
greens and 5 blues would correspond to the multiset
[ r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,g,g,g,g,b,b,b,b,b ].

The outcome consisting of 10 reds and 10 blues corresponds to the multiset
[ r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b ].

Thus the total number of outcomes is the number of 20-element multisets
made from the elements of the 3-element set X = {r,g,b}. By Fact 3.7, the
¡
¢ ¡ ¢
answer is 20+203−1 = 22
20 = 231 possible outcomes.
Rather than remembering the formula in Fact 3.7, it is probably best
to work out a new stars-and-bars model as needed. This is because it is
often easy to see how a particular problem can be modeled with stars and
bars, and once they have been set up, the formula in Fact 3.7 falls out
automatically.
For instance, we could solve Example 3.19 by noting that each outcome
has a star-and-bar encoding using 20 stars and 2 bars. (The outcome
[r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,g,g,g,g,b,b,b,b,b] can be encoded in stars and bars as
∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ | ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ | ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗, etc.) We can form such a list by choosing
2 out of 22 slots for bars and filling the remaining 20 slots with stars. There
¡ ¢
are 22
2 = 231 ways of doing this.
Our next example involves counting the number of non-negative integer
solutions of the equation w + x + y + z = 20. By a non-negative integer solution
to the equation, we mean an assignment of non-negative integers to the variables that makes the equation true. For example, one solution is w = 7, x = 3,
y = 5, z = 5. We can write this solution compactly as (w, x, y, z) = (7, 3, 5, 5).
Two other solutions are (w, x, y, z) = (1, 3, 1, 15) and (w, x, y, z) = (0, 20, 0, 0). We
would not include (w, x, y, z) = (1, −1, 10, 10) as a solution because even though
it satisfies the equation, the value of x is negative. How many solutions are
there all together? The next example presents a way of solving this type of
question.

Example 3.20 How many non-negative integer solutions does the equation w + x + y + z = 20 have?
Solution: We can model a solution with stars and bars. For example,
encode the solution (w, x, y, z) = (3, 4, 5, 8) as
3

4

5

8

z }| { ¯ z }| { ¯ z }| { ¯ z
}|
{
∗ ∗ ∗ ¯ ∗ ∗ ∗∗ ¯ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ¯ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗∗ .

In general, any solution (w, x, y, z) = (a, b, c, d) gets encoded as
a stars

b stars

c stars

d stars

z }| { ¯ z }| { ¯ z }| { ¯ z }| {
∗ ∗ ∗ · · · ∗ ¯ ∗ ∗ ∗ · · · ∗ ¯ ∗ ∗ ∗ · · · ∗ ¯ ∗ ∗ ∗ · · · ∗,

where all together there are 20 stars and 3 bars. So, for instance the solution
(w, x, y, z) = (0, 0, 10, 10) gets encoded as || ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗| ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗, and
the solution (w, x, y, z) = (7, 3, 5, 5) is encoded as ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗|∗∗∗|∗∗∗∗∗|∗∗∗∗∗.
Thus we can describe any non-negative integer solution to the equation as
a list of length 20 + 3 = 23 that has 20 stars and 3 bars. We can make any
such list by choosing 3 out of 23 spots for the bars, and filling the remaining
¡ ¢
23·22·21
23!
=
20 spots with stars. The number of ways to do this is 23
3 = 3!20! =
3·2
23 · 11 · 7 = 1771. Thus there are 1771 non-negative integer solutions of
w + x + y + z = 20.
For another approach to this example, model solutions of w + x + y + z = 20
©
ª
as 20-element multisets made from the elements of w, x, y, z . For example,
solution (5, 5, 4, 6) corresponds to [w, w, w, w, w, x, x, x, x, x, y, y, y, y, z, z, z, z, z, z].
¡
¢ ¡ ¢
By Fact 3.7, there are 20+204−1 = 23
20 = 1771 such multisets, so this is the
number of solutions to w + x + y + z = 20.
Example 3.21 This problem concerns the lists (w, x, y, z) of integers with
the property that 0 ≤ w ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 10. That is, each entry is an integer
between 0 and 10, and the entries are ordered from smallest to largest. For
example, (0, 3, 3, 7), (1, 1, 1, 1) and (2, 3, 6, 9) have this property, but (2, 3, 6, 4)
does not. How many such lists are there?
Solution: We can encode such a list with 10 stars and 4 bars, where w is
the number of stars to the left of the first bar, x is the number of stars to
the left of the second bar, y is the number of stars to the left of the third
bar, and z is the number of stars to the left of the fourth bar.
For example, (2, 3, 6, 9) is encoded as ∗ ∗ | ∗ | ∗ ∗ ∗ | ∗ ∗ ∗ |∗, and (1, 2, 3, 4) is
encoded as ∗| ∗ | ∗ | ∗ | ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗.

Here are some other examples of lists paired with their encodings.
(0, 3, 3, 7)
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(9, 9, 9, 10)

| ∗ ∗ ∗ | | ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ | ∗ ∗∗
∗ | | | | ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗∗
∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗|||∗ |

Such encodings are lists of length 14, with 10 stars and 4 bars. We can
make such a list by choosing 4 of the 14 slots for the bars and filling the
¡ ¢
remaining slots with stars. The number of ways to do this is 14
4 = 1001.
Answer: There are 1001 such lists.
We will examine one more type of multiset problem. To motivate it,
consider the permutations of the letters of the word “BOOK.” At first glance
there are 4 letters, so we should get 4! = 24 permutations. But this is not
quite right because two of the letters are identical. We could interchange the
two O’s but still have the same permutation. To get a grip on the problem,
let’s make one of the letters lower case: BOoK. Now our 24 permutations
are listed below in the oval.
BOoK KOoB OoKB OoBK OBoK OKoB OKBo OBKo BKOo KBOo KOBo BOKo
BoOK KoOB oOKB oOBK oBOK oKOB oKBO oBKO BKoO KBoO KoBO BoKO
BOOK KOOB OOKB OOBK OBOK OKOB OKBO OBKO BKOO KBOO KOBO BOKO

The columns in the oval correspond to the same permutation of the letters
of BOOK, as indicated in the row below the oval. Thus there are actually
4!
24
2 = 2 = 12 permutations of the letters of BOOK.
This is actually a problem about multisets. The letters in “BOOK” form a
£
¤
multiset B,O,O,K , and we have determined that there are 12 permutations
of this multiset.
For another motivational example, consider the permutations of the
letters of the word BANANA. Here there are two N’s and three A’s. Though
some of the letters look identical, think of them as distinct physical objects
that we can permute into different orderings. It helps to subscript the
letters to emphasize that they are actually six distinct objects:
B A 1 N 1 A2 N 2 A3 .

Now, there are 6! = 720 permutations of these six letters. It’s not practical
to write out all of them, but we can get a sense of the problem by making a
partial listing in the box below.

The first column lists the permutations of B A1 N1 A2 N2 A3 corresponding to
the word BANANA. By the multiplication principle, the column has 3!2! = 12
permutations because the three A i ’s can be permuted in 3! ways within
their positions, and the two N i ’s can be permuted in 2! ways. Similarly, the
second column lists the 3!2! = 12 permutations corresponding to the “word”
ABNANA.
All together there are 6! = 720 permutations of B A1 N1 A2 N2 A3 , and
groupings of 12 of them correspond to particular permutations of BANANA.

Therefore the total number of permutations of BANANA is 3!2!

3.9 The Division and Pigeonhole Principles

Our final fundamental counting principle is called the division principle.
Before discussing it, we need some notation. Given a number x, its floor
b xc is x rounded down to the nearest integer. Thus b 10
4 c = 2, and b9.31c = 9,
and b7c = 7, etc. The ceiling of x, denoted d xe, is x rounded up to the nearest
integer. Thus d 10
4 e = 3, and d9.31e = 10, and d7e = 7.
The division principle is often illustrated by a simple situation involving
pigeons. Imagine n pigeons that live in k pigeonholes, or boxes. (Possibly
n 6= k.) At night all the pigeons fly into the boxes. When this happens, some
of the k boxes may contain more than one pigeon, and some may be empty.
But no matter what, the average number of pigeons per box is nk . Obviously,
at least one of the boxes contains nk or more pigeons. (Because not all the
boxes can contain fewer than the average number of pigeons per box.) And
because a box must contain a whole number of pigeons, we round up to
conclude that at least one box contains d nk e or more pigeons.
Similarly, at least one box must contain nk or fewer pigeons, because not
all boxes can contain more than the average number of pigeons per box.
Rounding down, at least one box contains b nk c or fewer pigeons.
We call this line of reasoning the division principle. (Some texts call it
the strong form of the pigeonhole principle.)
Fact 3.9 (Division Principle)
Suppose n objects are placed into k boxes.
Then at least one box contains d nk e or more objects,
and at least one box contains b nk c or fewer objects.
This has a useful variant. If n > k, then nk > 1, so d nk e > 1, and this means
some box contains more than one object. On the other hand, if n < k then
n
n
k < 1, so b k c < 1, meaning at least one box is empty. Thus the division
principle yields the following consequence, called the pigeonhole principle.
Fact 3.10 (Pigeonhole Principle)
Suppose n objects are placed into k boxes.
If n > k, then at least one box contains more than one object.
If n < k, then at least one box is empty.
The pigeonhole principle is named for the scenario in which n pigeons
fly into k pigeonholes (or boxes). If there are more pigeons than boxes (n > k)

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

The Division and Pigeonhole Principles

105

then some box gets more than one pigeon. And if there are fewer pigeons
than boxes ( n < k) then there must be at least one empty box.
Like the multiplication, addition and subtraction principles, the division
and pigeonhole principles are intuitive and obvious, but they can prove
things that are not obvious. The challenge is seeing where and how to apply
them. Our examples will start simple and get progressively more complex.
For an extremely simple application, notice that in any group of 13
people, at least two of them were born on the same month. Although this is
obvious, it really does follow from the pigeonhole principle. Think of the 13
people as objects, and put each person in the “box” that is his birth month.
As there are more people than boxes (months), at least one box (month) has
two or more people in it, meaning at least two of the 13 people were born in
the same month.
Further, for any group of 100 people, the division principle says that
there is a month in which d 100
12 e = 9 or more of the people were born. It also
guarantees a month in which b 100
12 c = 8 or fewer of the people were born.
Example 3.24 Pick six integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). Show that
two of them must add up to 9.
For example, suppose you picked 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8. Then 1 + 8 = 9. If you
picked 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. then 4 + 5 = 9. The problem asks us to show that this
happens no matter how we pick the numbers.
Solution: Pick six numbers between 0 and 9. Here’s why two of them sum
to 9: Imagine five boxes, each marked with two numbers, as shown below.
Each box is labeled so that the two numbers written on it sum to 9.

0, 9

1, 8

2, 7

3, 6

4, 5

For each number that was picked, put it in the box having that number
written on it. For example, if we picked 7, it goes in the box labeled “2, 7.”
(The number 2, if picked, would go in that box too.) In this way we place the
six chosen numbers in five boxes. As there are more numbers than boxes,
the pigeonhole principle says that some box has more than one (hence two)
of the picked numbers in it. Those two numbers sum to 9.
Notice that if we picked only five numbers from 0 to 9, then it’s possible
that no two sum to 9: we could be unlucky and pick 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But the
pigeonhole principle ensures that if six are picked then two do sum to 9.

Example 3.25 A store has a gumball machine containing a large number
of red, green, blue and white gumballs. You get one gumball for each nickel
you put into the machine. The store offers the following deal: You agree to
buy some number of gumballs, and if 13 or more of them have the same
color you get $5. What is the fewest number of gumballs you need to buy to
be 100% certain that you will make money on the deal?
Solution: Let n be the number of gumballs that you buy. Imagine sorting
your n gumballs into four boxes labeled RED, GREEN, BLUE, and WHITE.
(That is, red balls go in the red box, green balls go in the green box, etc.)

RED

GREEN

BLUE

WHITE

The division principle says that one box contains d n4 e or more gumballs.
Provided d n4 e ≥ 13, you will know you have 13 gumballs of the same color.
This happens if n4 > 12 (so the ceiling of n4 rounds to a value larger than 12).
Therefore you need n > 4 · 12 = 48, so if n = 49 you know you have at least
d 49
4 e = d12.25e = 13 gumballs of the same color.
Answer: Buy 49 gumballs for 49 nickels, which is $2.45. You get $5, and
therefore have made $2.55.
Note that if you bought just 48 gumballs, you might win, but there is a
chance that you’d get 12 gumballs of each color and miss out on the $5. And
if you bought more than 49, you’d still get the $5, but you would have spent
more nickels.
Explicitly mentioning the boxes in the above solution is not necessary.
Some people prefer to draw a conclusion based averaging alone. They
might solve the problem by letting n be the number of gumballs bought,
so n = r + g + b + w, where r is the number of them that are red, g is the
number that are green, b is the number of blues and w is the number
of whites. Then the average number of gumballs of a particular color is
r+ g+b+w n
= . We need this to be greater than 12 to ensure 13 of the
4
4
same color, and the smallest number that does the job is n = 49. This is still

the division principle, in a pure form.

There we argued that the left-hand side n+k 1 is, by definition, the number

ª
of k-element subsets of the set S = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n with |S | = n + 1. But the righthand side also gives the number of k-element subsets of S , because such a
subset either contains 0 or it does not. We can make any k-element subset of
S that contains 0 by starting with 0 and selecting k − 1 other elements from

Both sides count the number of k-element subsets of S , so they are equal.
This is combinatorial proof.
Example 3.27 Use combinatorial proof to show

Solution. First, by definition, if k < 0 or k > n, then both sides are 0, and
thus equal. Therefore for the rest of the proof we can assume 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
¡ ¢
©
ª
The left-hand side nk is the number of k-element subsets of S = 1, 2, . . . , n .
Every k-element subset X ⊆ S pairs with a unique (n − k)-element subset
X = S − X ⊆ S . Thus the number of k-element subsets of S equals the number
¡ ¢ ¡
¢
of (n − k)-element subsets of S , which is to say nk = n−n k .

Solution. First, the right-hand side n is the number of ways to select n
things from a set S that has 2n elements.
Now let’s count this a different way. Divide S into two equal-sized parts,
S = A ∪ B, where | A | = n and |B| = n, and A ∩ B = ;.
For any fixed k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n, we can select n things from S by taking k
things from A and n − k things from B for a total of k + (n − k) = n things. By
¡ ¢¡
¢
the multiplication principle, we get nk n−n k n-element subsets of S this way.
As k could be any number from 0 to n, the number of ways to select n
things from S is thus

How to Prove Conditional
Statements

CHAPTER 4

Direct Proof

t is time to prove some theorems. There are various strategies for doing
this; we now examine the most straightforward approach, a technique
called direct proof. As we begin, it is important to keep in mind the meanings
of three key terms: theorem, proof and definition.
A theorem is a mathematical statement that is true and can be (and
has been) verified as true. A proof of a theorem is a written verification
that shows that the theorem is definitely and unequivocally true. A proof
should be understandable and convincing to anyone who has the requisite
background and knowledge. This knowledge includes an understanding of
the meanings of the mathematical words, phrases and symbols that occur
in the theorem and its proof. It is crucial that both the writer of the proof
and the readers of the proof agree on the exact meanings of all the words,
for otherwise there is an intolerable level of ambiguity. A definition is an
exact, unambiguous explanation of the meaning of a mathematical word or
phrase. We will elaborate on the terms theorem and definition in the next
two sections, and then finally we will be ready to begin writing proofs.

I

4.1 Theorems
A theorem is a statement that is true and has been proved to be true. You
have encountered many theorems in your mathematical education. Here
are some theorems taken from an undergraduate calculus text. They will
be familiar to you, though you may not have read all the proofs.
Theorem: Let f be differentiable on an open interval I and let c ∈ I . If
f (c) is the maximum or minimum value of f on I , then f 0 (c) = 0.
Theorem: If

P∞

k=1

a k converges, then lim a k = 0.
k→∞

Theorem: Suppose f is continuous on the interval [a, b]. Then f is
integrable on [a, b].
Theorem: Every absolutely convergent series converges.

Direct Proof

114

Observe that each of these theorems either has the conditional form “If
P , then Q ,” or can be put into that form. The first theorem has an initial
sentence “Let f be differentiable on an open interval I , and let c ∈ I ,” which

sets up some notation, but a conditional statement follows it. The third
theorem has form “Suppose P . Then Q ,” but this means the same thing
as “If P , then Q .” The last theorem can be re-expressed as “If a series is
absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.”
¡ ¢2 ¡ ¢
P
For another example, the equation nk=0 nk = 2nn from Example 3.28
(page 109) is best phrased as a conditional statement, to make clear the
assumption that n is an integer.
Theorem: If n is a non-negative integer, then

n ¡ ¢2
P
n
k=0

k

.

A theorem of the form “If P , then Q ,” can be regarded as a device that
produces new information from P . Whenever we are dealing with a situation
in which P is true, then the theorem guarantees that, in addition, Q is true.
Since this kind of expansion of information is useful, theorems of the form
“If P , then Q ,” are very common.
But not every theorem is a conditional statement. Some have the form
of the biconditional P ⇔ Q , but, as we know, that can be expressed as two
conditional statements. Other theorems simply state facts about specific
things. For example, here is another theorem from your study of calculus.
Theorem: The harmonic series 1 + 12 + 13 + 41 + 15 + · · · diverges.
It would be difficult (or at least awkward) to restate this as a conditional
statement. Still, it is true that most theorems are conditional statements,
so much of this book will concentrate on that type of theorem.
It is important to be aware that there are a number of words that mean
essentially the same thing as the word “theorem,” but are used in slightly
different ways. In general the word “theorem” is reserved for a statement
that is considered important or significant (the Pythagorean theorem, for
example). A statement that is true but not as significant is sometimes called
a proposition. A lemma is a theorem whose main purpose is to help prove
another theorem. A corollary is a result that is an immediate consequence
of a theorem or proposition. It is not important that you remember all these
words now, for their meanings will become clear with usage.
Our main task is to learn how to prove theorems. As the above examples
suggest, proving theorems requires a clear understanding of the conditional
statement, and that is the main reason we studied it so extensively in
Chapter 2. It is also crucial to understand the role of definitions.

4.2 Definitions
A proof of a theorem should be absolutely convincing. Ambiguity must be
avoided. Everyone must agree on the exact meaning of each mathematical
term. In Chapter 1 we defined the meanings of the sets N, Z, R, Q and ;, as
well as the meanings of the symbols ∈ and ⊆, and we shall make frequent
use of these things. Here is another definition that we use often.
Definition 4.1

An integer n is even if n = 2a for some integer a ∈ Z.

Thus, for example, 10 is even because 10 = 2 · 5. Also, according to the
definition, 7 is not even because there is no integer a for which 7 = 2a. While
there would be nothing wrong with defining an integer to be odd if it’s not
even, the following definition is more concrete.
Definition 4.2 An integer n is odd if n = 2a + 1 for some integer a ∈ Z.
Thus 7 is odd because 7 = 2 · 3 + 1. We will use these definitions whenever
the concept of even or odd numbers arises. If in a proof a certain number is
even, the definition allows us to write it as 2a for an appropriate integer a.
If some quantity has form 2b + 1 where b is an integer, then the definition
tells us the quantity is odd.
Definition 4.3 Two integers have the same parity if they are both
even or they are both odd. Otherwise they have opposite parity.
Thus 5 and −17 have the same parity, as do 8 and 0; but 3 and 4 have
opposite parity.
Two points about definitions are in order. First, in this book the word
or term being defined appears in boldface type. Second, it is common to
express definitions as conditional statements even though the biconditional
would more appropriately convey the meaning. Consider the definition of an
even integer. You understand full well that if n is even then n = 2a (for a ∈ Z),
and if n = 2a, then n is even. Thus, technically the definition should read
“An integer n is even if and only if n = 2a for some a ∈ Z.” However, it is an
almost-universal convention that definitions are phrased in the conditional
form, even though they are interpreted as being in the biconditional form.
There is really no good reason for this, other than economy of words. It is
the standard way of writing definitions, and we have to get used to it.
Here is another definition that we will use often.

Direct Proof

Definition 4.4 Suppose a and b are integers. We say that a divides b,
written a | b, if b = ac for some c ∈ Z. In this case we also say that a is a
divisor of b, and that b is a multiple of a.
For example, 5 divides 15 because 15 = 5 · 3. We write this as 5 | 15.
Similarly 8 | 32 because 32 = 8 · 4, and −6 | 6 because 6 = −6 · −1. However, 6
does not divide 9 because there is no integer c for which 9 = 6 · c. We express
this as 6 - 9, which we read as “6 does not divide 9.”
Be careful of your interpretation of the symbols. There is a big difference
between the expressions a | b and a/b. The expression a | b is a statement,
while a/b is a fraction. For example, 8 | 16 is true and 8 | 20 is false. By
contrast, 8/16 = 0.5 and 8/20 = 0.4 are numbers, not statements. Be careful
not to write one when you mean the other.
Every integer has a set of integers that divide it. For example, the set of
©
ª ©
ª
divisors of 6 is a ∈ Z : a | 6 = − 6, −3, −2, −1, 1, 2, 3, 6 . The set of divisors of 5
©
ª
is − 5, −1, 1, 5 . The set of divisors of 0 is Z. This brings us to the following
definition, with which you are already familiar.
Definition 4.5 A number n ∈ N is prime if it has exactly two positive
divisors, 1 and n. If n has more than two positive divisors, it is called
composite. (Thus n is composite if and only if n = ab for 1 < a, b < n.)
For example, 2 is prime, as are 5 and 17. The definition implies that 1 is
neither prime nor composite, as it only has one positive divisor, namely 1.
Definition 4.6 The greatest common divisor of integers a and b,
denoted gcd(a, b), is the largest integer that divides both a and b.
The least common multiple of non-zero integers a and b, denoted
lcm(a, b), is the smallest integer in N that is a multiple of both a and b.
So gcd(18, 24) = 6, gcd(5, 5) = 5 and gcd(32, −8) = 8. Also gcd(50, 18) = 2,
but gcd(50, 9) = 1. Note that gcd(0, 6) = 6, because, although every integer
divides 0, the largest divisor of 6 is 6.
The expression gcd(0, 0) is problematic. Every integer divides 0, so the
only conclusion is that gcd(0, 0) = ∞. We circumvent this irregularity by
simply agreeing to consider gcd(a, b) only when a and b are not both zero.
Continuing our examples, lcm(4, 6) = 12, and lcm(7, 7) = 7.
Of course not all terms can be defined. If every word in a definition were
defined, there would be separate definitions for the words that appeared

Richard Hammack

Definitions

117

in those definitions, and so on, until the chain of defined terms became
circular. Thus we accept some ideas as being so intuitively clear that they
require no definitions or verifications. For example, we will not find it
necessary to define what an integer (or a real number) is. Nor will we define
addition, multiplication, subtraction and division, though we will use these
operations freely. We accept and use such things as the distributive and
commutative properties of addition and multiplication, as well as other
standard properties of arithmetic and algebra.
As mentioned in Section 1.9, we accept as fact the natural ordering of the
elements of N, Z, Q and R, so that (for example) statements such as “5 < 7,”
and “ x < y implies − x > − y,” do not need to be justified.
In addition, we accept the following fact without justification or proof.
Fact 4.1 If a and b are integers, then so are their sum, product and
difference. That is, if a, b ∈ Z, then a + b ∈ Z, a − b ∈ Z and ab ∈ Z
It follows that any combination of integers using the operations +, − and ·
is an integer. For example, if a, b and c are integers, then a2 b − ca + b ∈ Z.
We will also accept as obvious the fact that any integer a can be divided
by a positive integer b, resulting in a unique quotient q and remainder r .
For example, b = 3 goes into a = 17 q = 5 times with remainder r = 2. In
symbols, 17 = 5 · 3 + 2, or a = qb + r . This fact, called the division algorithm,
was mentioned on page 30.
(The Division Algorithm) Given integers a and b with b > 0, there exist
unique integers q and r for which a = qb + r and 0 ≤ r < b.
Another fact that we will accept without proof (at least for now) is
that every natural number greater than 1 has a unique factorization into
primes. For example, the number 1176 can be factored into primes as
1176 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 3 · 7 · 7 = 23 · 3 · 72 . By unique we mean that any factorization
of 1176 into primes will have exactly the same factors (i.e., three 2’s, one 3
and two 7’s). Thus, for example, there is no valid factorization of 1176 that
has a factor of 5. You may be so used to factoring numbers into primes that
it seems obvious that there cannot be different prime factorizations of the
same number, but in fact this is a fundamental result whose proof is not
transparent. Nonetheless, we will be content to assume that every natural
number greater than 1 has a unique factorization into primes. (We will
revisit the issue of a proof in Section 10.3.)
We will introduce other accepted facts, as well as definitions, as needed.

4.3 Direct Proof

This section explains a simple way to prove theorems or propositions that
have the form of conditional statements. The technique is called direct
proof. To simplify the discussion, our first examples will involve proving
statements that are almost obviously true. Thus we will call the statements
propositions rather than theorems. (Remember, a proposition is a statement
that, although true, is not as significant as a theorem.)
To understand how the technique of direct proof works, suppose we have
some proposition of the following form.
Proposition

If P , then Q .

This proposition is a conditional statement of form P ⇒ Q . Our goal is
to show that this conditional statement is true. To see how to proceed, look
at the truth table for P ⇒ Q .
P

The table shows that if P is false, the statement P ⇒ Q is automatically
true. This means that if we are concerned with showing P ⇒ Q is true, we
don’t have to worry about the situations where P is false (as in the last two
lines of the table) because the statement P ⇒ Q will be automatically true
in those cases. But we must be very careful about the situations where P is
true (as in the first two lines of the table). We must show that the condition
of P being true forces Q to be true also, for that means the second line of
the table cannot happen.
This gives a fundamental outline for proving statements of the form
P ⇒ Q . Begin by assuming that P is true (remember, we don’t need to worry
about P being false) and show this forces Q to be true.

So the setup for direct proof is remarkably simple. The first line of the
proof is the sentence “Suppose P .” The last line is the sentence “Therefore Q .”
Between the first and last line we use logic, definitions and standard math
facts to transform the statement P to the statement Q . It is common to use
the word “Proof” to indicate the beginning of a proof, and the symbol to
indicate the end.
As our first example, let’s prove that if x is odd then x2 is also odd.
(Granted, this is not a terribly impressive result, but we will move on to
more significant things in due time.) The first step in the proof is to fill in
the outline for direct proof. This is a lot like painting a picture, where the
basic structure is sketched in first. We leave some space between the first
and last line of the proof. The following series of frames indicates the steps
you might take to fill in this space with a logical chain of reasoning.
Proposition If x is odd, then x2 is odd.
Proof. Suppose x is odd.

Therefore x2 is odd.

■

Now that we have written the first and last lines, we need to fill in the space
with a chain of reasoning that shows that x being odd forces x2 to be odd.
In doing this it’s always advisable to use any definitions that apply. The
first line says x is odd, and by Definition 4.2 it must be that x = 2a + 1 for
some a ∈ Z, so we write this in as our second line.
Proposition

If x is odd, then x2 is odd.

Proof. Suppose x is odd.
Then x = 2a + 1 for some a ∈ Z, by definition of an odd number.
Therefore x2 is odd.

■

Now jump down to the last line, which says x2 is odd. Think about what
the line immediately above it would have to be in order for us to conclude
that x2 is odd. By the definition of an odd number, we would have to have
x2 = 2a + 1 for some a ∈ Z. However, the symbol a now appears earlier in the
proof in a different context, so we should use a different symbol, say b.

Direct Proof

120
Proposition

If x is odd, then x2 is odd.

Proof. Suppose x is odd.
Then x = 2a + 1 for some a ∈ Z, by definition of an odd number.
Thus x2 = 2b + 1 for an integer b.
Therefore x2 is odd, by definition of an odd number.

■

We are almost there. We can bridge the gap as follows.
Proposition

If x is odd, then x2 is odd.

Proof. Suppose x is odd.
Then x = 2a + 1 for some a ∈ Z, by definition of an odd number.
Thus x2 = (2a + 1)2 = 4a2 + 4a + 1 = 2(2a2 + 2a) + 1.
So x2 = 2b + 1 where b is the integer b = 2a2 + 2a.
Thus x2 = 2b + 1 for an integer b.
Therefore x2 is odd, by definition of an odd number.

■

Finally, we may wish to clean up our work and write the proof in paragraph
form. Here is our final version.
Proposition

If x is odd, then x2 is odd.

Proof. Suppose x is odd. Then x = 2a + 1 for some a ∈ Z, by definition
of an odd number. Thus x2 = (2a + 1)2 = 4a2 + 4a + 1 = 2(2a2 + 2a) + 1, so
x2 = 2b + 1 where b = 2a2 + 2a ∈ Z. Therefore x2 is odd, by definition
of an odd number.
■
At least initially, it’s generally a good idea to write the first and last line
of your proof first, and then fill in the gap, sometimes jumping alternately
between top and bottom until you meet in the middle, as we did above. This
way you are constantly reminded that you are aiming for the statement
at the bottom. Sometimes you will leave too much space, sometimes not
enough. Sometimes you will get stuck before figuring out what to do. This
is normal. Mathematicians do scratch work just as artists do sketches for
their paintings.

Richard Hammack

Direct Proof

121

Here is another example. Consider proving the following proposition.
Proposition

Let a, b and c be integers. If a | b and b | c, then a | c.

Let’s apply the basic outline for direct proof. To clarify the procedure we
will write the proof in stages again.
Proposition Let a, b and c be integers. If a | b and b | c, then a | c.
Proof. Suppose a | b and b | c.

Therefore a | c.

■

Our first step is to apply Definition 4.4 to the first line. The definition
says a | b means b = ac for some integer c, but since c already appears in
a different context on the first line, we must use a different letter, say d .
Similarly let’s use a new letter e in the definition of b | c.
Proposition Let a, b and c be integers. If a | b and b | c, then a | c.
Proof. Suppose a | b and b | c.
By Definition 4.4, we know a | b means b = ad for some d ∈ Z.
Likewise, b | c means c = be for some e ∈ Z.
Therefore a | c.

■

We have almost bridged the gap. The line immediately above the last line
should show that a | c. According to Definition 4.4, this line should say that
c = ax for some integer x. We can get this equation from the lines at the top,
as follows.
Proposition Let a, b and c be integers. If a | b and b | c, then a | c.
Proof. Suppose a | b and b | c.
By Definition 4.4, we know a | b means b = ad for some d ∈ Z.
Likewise, b | c means c = be for some e ∈ Z.
Thus c = be = (ad)e = a(de), so c = ax for the integer x = de.
Therefore a | c.
The next example is presented all at once rather than in stages.

Proposition

If x is an even integer, then x2 − 6x + 5 is odd.

Proof. Suppose x is an even integer.
Then x = 2a for some a ∈ Z, by definition of an even integer.
So x2 −6x +5 = (2a)2 −6(2a)+5 = 4a2 −12a +5 = 4a2 −12a +4+1 = 2(2a2 −6a +2)+1.
Therefore we have x2 − 6x + 5 = 2b + 1, where b = 2a2 − 6a + 2 ∈ Z.
Consequently x2 − 6x + 5 is odd, by definition of an odd number.
■
One doesn’t normally use a separate line for each sentence in a proof,
but for clarity we will often do this in the first few chapters of this book.
Our next example illustrates a standard technique for showing two
quantities are equal. If we can show m ≤ n and n ≤ m then it follows that
m = n. In general, the reasoning involved in showing m ≤ n can be quite
different from that of showing n ≤ m.
Recall Definition 4.6 of a least common multiple on page 116.
Proposition

If a, b, c ∈ N, then lcm(ca, cb) = c · lcm(a, b).

Proof. Assume a, b, c ∈ N. Let m = lcm(ca, cb) and n = c · lcm(a, b). We will
show m = n. By definition, lcm(a, b) is a positive multiple of both a and b, so
lcm(a, b) = ax = b y for some x, y ∈ N. From this we see that n = c · lcm(a, b) =
cax = cb y is a positive multiple of both ca and cb. But m = lcm(ca, cb) is the
smallest positive multiple of both ca and cb. Thus m ≤ n.
On the other hand, as m = lcm(ca, cb) is a multiple of both ca and cb, we
have m = cax = cb y for some x, y ∈ Z. Then 1c m = ax = b y is a multiple of both
a and b. Therefore lcm(a, b) ≤ 1c m, so c · lcm(a, b) ≤ m, that is, n ≤ m.
We’ve shown m ≤ n and n ≤ m, so m = n. The proof is complete.
■
The examples we’ve looked at so far have all been proofs of statements
about integers. In our next example, we are going to prove that if x and y
p
p
are positive real numbers for which x ≤ y, then x ≤ y. You may feel that
the proof is not as “automatic” as the proofs we have done so far. Finding
the right steps in a proof can be challenging, and that is part of the fun.

This proposition tells us that whenever x ≤ y, we can take the square
p
p
root of both sides and be assured that x ≤ y. This can be useful, as we
will see in our next proposition.
p
That proposition will concern the expression 2 x y ≤ x + y. Notice when
you substitute random positive values for the variables, the expression is
p
p
true. For example, for x = 6 and y = 4, the left side is 2 6 · 4 = 4 6 ≈ 9.79,
p
which is less than the right side 6 + 4 = 10. Is it true that 2 x y ≤ x + y for
any positive x and y? How could we prove it?
To see how, let’s first cast this into the form of a conditional statement:
p
If x and y are positive real numbers, then 2 x y ≤ x + y. The proof begins
p
with the assumption that x and y are positive, and ends with 2 x y ≤ x + y.
In mapping out a strategy, it can be helpful to work backwards, working
p
from 2 x y ≤ x + y to something that is obviously true. Then the steps can be
p
reversed in the proof. In this case, squaring both sides of 2 x y ≤ x + y gives
us
4x y ≤ x2 + 2x y + y2 .

Now subtract 4x y from both sides and factor:
0 ≤

x2 − 2x y + y2

0 ≤ (x − y)2 .

But this last line is clearly true, since the square of x − y cannot be negative!
This gives us a strategy for the proof, which follows.
Proposition

p

If x and y are positive real numbers, then 2 x y ≤ x + y.

Proof. Suppose x and y are positive real numbers.
Then 0 ≤ (x − y)2 , that is, 0 ≤ x2 − 2x y + y2 .
Adding 4x y to both sides gives 4x y ≤ x2 + 2x y + y2 .
Factoring yields 4x y ≤ (x + y)2 .
Previously we proved that such an inequality still holds after taking the
p
square root of both sides; doing so produces 2 x y ≤ x + y.
■
Notice that in the last step of the proof
p we took the square root of both
p
sides of 4x y ≤ (x + y)2 and got 4x y ≤ (x + y)2 , and the fact that this did
not reverse the symbol ≤ followed from our previous proposition. This is an
important point. Often the proof of a proposition or theorem uses another
proposition or theorem (that has already been proved).

4.4 Using Cases

In proving a statement is true, we sometimes have to examine multiple
cases before showing the statement is true in all possible scenarios. This
section illustrates a few examples.
Our examples will concern the expression 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1). Here is a
table showing its value for various integers for n. Notice that 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1)
is a multiple of 4 in every line.

Is 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) always a multiple of 4? We prove the answer is “yes”
in our next example. Notice, however, that the expression 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1)
behaves differently depending on whether n is even or odd, for in the first
case (−1)n = 1, and in the second (−1)n = −1. Thus the proof must examine
these two possibilities separately.
Proposition

If n ∈ N, then 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) is a multiple of 4.

Proof. Suppose n ∈ N.
Then n is either even or odd. Let’s consider these two cases separately.
Case 1. Suppose n is even. Then n = 2k for some k ∈ Z, and (−1)n = 1.
Thus 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) = 1 + (1)(2 · 2k − 1) = 4k, which is a multiple of 4.
Case 2. Suppose n is odd. Then n = 2k + 1 for some k ∈ Z, and (−1)n = −1.
Thus 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) = 1 − (2(2k + 1) − 1) = −4k, which is a multiple of 4.
These cases show that 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) is always a multiple of 4.

■

Now let’s examine the flip side of the question. We just proved that
1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) is always a multiple of 4, but can we get every multiple of 4
this way? The following proposition and proof give an affirmative answer.

Proposition

Every multiple of 4 equals 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) for some n ∈ N.

Proof. In conditional form, the proposition is as follows:
If k is a multiple of 4, then there is an n ∈ N for which 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) = k.
What follows is a proof of this conditional statement.
Suppose k is a multiple of 4.
This means k = 4a for some integer a.
We must produce an n ∈ N for which 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) = k.
This is done by cases, depending on whether a is zero, positive or negative.
Case 1. Suppose a = 0. Let n = 1. Then 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) = 1 + (−1)1 (2 − 1) = 0
= 4 · 0 = 4a = k.
Case 2. Suppose a > 0. Let n = 2a, which is in N because a is positive. Also
n is even, so (−1)n = 1. Thus 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) = 1 + (2n − 1) = 2n = 2(2a) = 4a = k.
Case 3. Suppose a < 0. Let n = 1 − 2a, which is an element of N because
a is negative, making 1 − 2a positive. Also n is odd, so (−1)n = −1. Thus
1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) = 1 − (2n − 1) = 1 − (2(1 − 2a) − 1) = 4a = k.
The above cases show that no matter whether a multiple k = 4a of 4 is
zero, positive or negative, k = 1 + (−1)n (2n − 1) for some n ∈ N.

4.5 Treating Similar Cases
Occasionally two or more cases in a proof will be so similar that writing
them separately seems tedious or unnecessary. Here is an example:
Proposition

If two integers have opposite parity, then their sum is odd.

Proof. Suppose m and n are two integers with opposite parity.
We need to show that m + n is odd. This is done in two cases, as follows.
Case 1. Suppose m is even and n is odd. Thus m = 2a and n = 2b + 1 for
some integers a and b. Therefore m + n = 2a + 2b + 1 = 2(a + b) + 1, which is
odd (by Definition 4.2).
Case 2. Suppose m is odd and n is even. Thus m = 2a + 1 and n = 2b for
some integers a and b. Therefore m + n = 2a + 1 + 2b = 2(a + b) + 1, which is
odd (by Definition 4.2).
In either case, m + n is odd.
■
The two cases in this proof are entirely alike except for the order in
which the even and odd terms occur. It is entirely appropriate to just do
one case and indicate that the other case is nearly identical. The phrase
“Without loss of generality...” is a common way of signaling that the proof is
treating just one of several nearly identical cases. Here is a second version
of the above example.

Proposition

If two integers have opposite parity, then their sum is odd.

Proof. Suppose m and n are two integers with opposite parity.
We need to show that m + n is odd.
Without loss of generality, suppose m is even and n is odd.
Thus m = 2a and n = 2b + 1 for some integers a and b.
Therefore m + n = 2a + 2b + 1 = 2(a + b) + 1, which is odd (by Definition 4.2). ■
In reading proofs in other texts, you may sometimes see the phrase
“Without loss of generality” abbreviated as “WLOG.” However, in the interest
of transparency we will avoid writing it this way. In a similar spirit, it is
advisable—at least until you become more experienced in proof writing—
that you write out all cases, no matter how similar they appear to be.
Please check your understanding by doing the following exercises. The
odd numbered problems have complete proofs in the Solutions section in

Contrapositive Proof

e now examine an alternative to direct proof called contrapositive
proof. Like direct proof, the technique of contrapositive proof is
used to prove conditional statements of the form “If P , then Q .” Although
it is possible to use direct proof exclusively, there are occasions where
contrapositive proof is much easier.

W

5.1 Contrapositive Proof
To understand how contrapositive proof works, imagine that you need to
prove a proposition of the following form.
Proposition

If P , then Q .

This is a conditional statement of form P ⇒ Q . Our goal is to show that
this conditional statement is true. Recall that in Section 2.6 we observed
that P ⇒ Q is logically equivalent to ∼ Q ⇒∼ P . For convenience, we duplicate
the truth table that verifies this fact.

According to the table, statements P ⇒ Q and ∼ Q ⇒∼ P are different
ways of expressing exactly the same thing. The expression ∼ Q ⇒∼ P is
called the contrapositive form of P ⇒ Q . (Do not confuse the two words
contrapositive and converse. Recall from Section 2.4 that the converse of
P ⇒ Q is the statement Q ⇒ P , which is not logically equivalent to P ⇒ Q .)

Contrapositive Proof

129

Since P ⇒ Q is logically equivalent to ∼ Q ⇒∼ P , it follows that to prove
P ⇒ Q is true, it suffices to instead prove that ∼ Q ⇒∼ P is true. If we were
to use direct proof to show ∼ Q ⇒∼ P is true, we would assume ∼ Q is true
and use this to deduce that ∼ P is true. This in fact is the basic approach of
contrapositive proof, summarized as follows.
Outline for Contrapositive Proof
Proposition

If P , then Q .

Proof. Suppose ∼ Q .
..
.

Therefore ∼ P .

■

So the setup for contrapositive proof is very simple. The first line of the
proof is the sentence “Suppose Q is not true.” (Or something to that effect.)
The last line is the sentence “Therefore P is not true.” Between the first and
last line we use logic and definitions to transform the statement ∼ Q to the
statement ∼ P .
To illustrate this new technique, and to contrast it with direct proof, we
now prove a proposition in two ways: first with direct proof and then with
contrapositive proof.
Proposition

Suppose x ∈ Z. If 7x + 9 is even, then x is odd.

Proof. (Direct) Suppose 7x + 9 is even.
Thus 7x + 9 = 2a for some integer a.
Subtracting 6x + 9 from both sides, we get x = 2a − 6x − 9.
Thus x = 2a − 6x − 9 = 2a − 6x − 10 + 1 = 2(a − 3x − 5) + 1.
Consequently x = 2b + 1, where b = a − 3x − 5 ∈ Z.
Therefore x is odd.

■

Here is a contrapositive proof of the same statement:
Proposition

Suppose x ∈ Z. If 7x + 9 is even, then x is odd.

Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose x is not odd.
Thus x is even, so x = 2a for some integer a.
Then 7x + 9 = 7(2a) + 9 = 14a + 8 + 1 = 2(7a + 4) + 1.
Therefore 7x + 9 = 2b + 1, where b is the integer 7a + 4.
Consequently 7x + 9 is odd.
Therefore 7x + 9 is not even.

Contrapositive Proof

130

Though the proofs have equal length, you may feel that the contrapositive
proof was smoother. This is because it is easier to transform information
about x into information about 7x + 9 than the other way around. For our
next example, consider the following proposition concerning an integer x:
Proposition

Suppose x ∈ Z. If x2 − 6x + 5 is even, then x is odd.

A direct proof would be problematic. We would begin by assuming that
x − 6x + 5 is even, so x2 − 6x + 5 = 2a. Then we would need to transform this
into x = 2b + 1 for b ∈ Z. But it is not quite clear how that could be done, for
it would involve isolating an x from the quadratic expression. However the
proof becomes very simple if we use contrapositive proof.
2

Proposition

Suppose x ∈ Z. If x2 − 6x + 5 is even, then x is odd.

Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose x is not odd.
Thus x is even, so x = 2a for some integer a.
So x2 −6x +5 = (2a)2 −6(2a)+5 = 4a2 −12a +5 = 4a2 −12a +4+1 = 2(2a2 −6a +2)+1.
Therefore x2 − 6x + 5 = 2b + 1, where b is the integer 2a2 − 6a + 2.
Consequently x2 − 6x + 5 is odd.
Therefore x2 − 6x + 5 is not even.
■
In summary, since x being not odd (∼ Q ) resulted in x2 − 6x + 5 being not
even (∼ P ), then x2 − 6x + 5 being even (P ) means that x is odd (Q ). Thus we
have proved P ⇒ Q by proving ∼ Q ⇒∼ P . Here is another example:
Proposition

Suppose x, y ∈ R. If y3 + yx2 ≤ x3 + x y2 , then y ≤ x.

Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose it is not true that y ≤ x, so y > x.
Then y − x > 0. Multiply both sides of y − x > 0 by the positive value x2 + y2 .
(y − x)(x2 + y2 ) > 0(x2 + y2 )
yx2 + y3 − x3 − x y2

y + yx

> 0
>

x3 + x y2

Therefore y3 + yx2 > x3 + x y2 , so it is not true that y3 + yx2 ≤ x3 + x y2 .

■

Proving “If P , then Q ,” with the contrapositive approach necessarily
involves the negated statements ∼ P and ∼ Q . In working with these we
may have to use the techniques for negating statements (e.g., DeMorgan’s
laws) discussed in Section 2.10. We consider such an example next.

Congruence of Integers
Proposition

131

Suppose x, y ∈ Z. If 5 - x y, then 5 - x and 5 - y.

Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose it is not true that 5 - x and 5 - y.
By DeMorgan’s law, it is not true that 5 - x or it is not true that 5 - y.
Therefore 5 | x or 5 | y. We consider these possibilities separately.
Case 1. Suppose 5 | x. Then x = 5a for some a ∈ Z.
From this we get x y = (5a)y = 5(a y), and that means 5 | x y.
Case 2. Suppose 5 | y. Then y = 5a for some a ∈ Z.
From this we get x y = x(5a) = 5(xa), and that means 5 | x y.
The above cases show that 5 | x y, so it is not true that 5 - x y.

■

5.2 Congruence of Integers
Now is a good time to introduce a new definition that occurs in many
branches of mathematics and will surely play a role in some of your later
courses. But our main reason for introducing it is that it provides more
opportunities to practice writing proofs, both direct and contrapositive.
Definition 5.1 Given integers a and b and n ∈ N, we say that a and b
are congruent modulo n if n | (a − b). We express this as a ≡ b (mod n).
If a and b are not congruent modulo n, we write this as a 6≡ b (mod n).
Example 5.1 Here are some examples:
1. 9 ≡ 1 (mod 4) because 4 | (9 − 1).
2.

6 ≡ 10 (mod 4) because 4 | (6 − 10).

3.

14 6≡ 8 (mod 4) because 4 - (14 − 8).

4.

20 ≡ 4 (mod 8) because 8 | (20 − 4).

5.

17 ≡ −4 (mod 3) because 3 | (17 − (−4)).

In practical terms, a ≡ b (mod n) means that a and b have the same
remainder when divided by n. For example, we saw above that 6 ≡ 10
(mod 4) and indeed 6 and 10 both have remainder 2 when divided by 4. Also
we saw 14 6≡ 8 (mod 4), and sure enough 14 has remainder 2 when divided
by 4, while 8 has remainder 0.
To see that this is true in general, note that if a and b both have the
same remainder r when divided by n, then it follows that a = kn + r and
b = ` n + r for some k, ` ∈ Z. Then a − b = (kn + r) − (` n + r) = n(k − `). But
a − b = n(k − `) means n | (a − b), so a ≡ b (mod n). Conversely, this chapter’s
Exercise 32 asks you to show that if a ≡ b (mod n), then a and b have the
same remainder when divided by n.

Free PDF version

Contrapositive Proof

132

We conclude this section with several proofs involving congruence of
integers, but you will also test your skills with other proofs in the exercises.
Proposition

Let a, b ∈ Z and n ∈ N. If a ≡ b (mod n), then a2 ≡ b2 (mod n).

Proof. We will use direct proof. Suppose a ≡ b (mod n).
By definition of congruence of integers, this means n | (a − b).
Then by definition of divisibility, there is an integer c for which a − b = nc.
Now multiply both sides of this equation by a + b.
a−b

=

(a − b)(a + b) =
a2 − b 2

=

nc
nc(a + b)
nc(a + b)

Since c(a + b) ∈ Z, the above equation tells us n | (a2 − b2 ).
According to Definition 5.1, this gives a2 ≡ b2 (mod n).

■

Let’s pause to consider this proposition’s meaning. It says a ≡ b (mod n)
implies a2 ≡ b2 (mod n). In other words, it says that if integers a and b have
the same remainder when divided by n, then a2 and b2 also have the same
remainder when divided by n. As an example of this, 6 and 10 have the same
remainder (2) when divided by n = 4, and their squares 36 and 100 also have
the same remainder (0) when divided by n = 4. The proposition promises
this will happen for all a, b and n. In our examples we tend to concentrate
more on how to prove propositions than on what the propositions mean.
This is reasonable since our main goal is to learn how to prove statements.
But it is helpful to sometimes also think about the meaning of what we
prove.
Proposition

Let a, b, c ∈ Z and n ∈ N. If a ≡ b (mod n), then ac ≡ bc (mod n).

Proof. We employ direct proof. Suppose a ≡ b (mod n). By Definition 5.1, it
follows that n | (a − b). Therefore, by definition of divisibility, there exists an
integer k for which a − b = nk. Multiply both sides of this equation by c to
get ac − bc = nkc. Thus ac − bc = n(kc) where kc ∈ Z, which means n | (ac − bc).
By Definition 5.1, we have ac ≡ bc (mod n).
■
Contrapositive proof seems to be the best approach in the next example,
since it will eliminate the symbols - and 6≡.

Mathematical Writing
Proposition

133

Suppose a, b ∈ Z and n ∈ N. If 12a 6≡ 12b (mod n), then n - 12.

Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose n | 12. Then 12 = nc for some c ∈ Z. Thus
12(a − b) =

nc(a − b)

From this, 12a − 12b = n(ca − cb). Because ca − cb ∈ Z, we get n | (12a − 12b).
This in turn means 12a ≡ 12b (mod n).
■
5.3 Mathematical Writing
Now that we have begun writing proofs, it is a good time to contemplate the
craft of writing. Unlike logic and mathematics, where there is a clear-cut
distinction between what is right or wrong, the difference between good and
bad writing is sometimes a matter of opinion. But there are some standard
guidelines that will make your writing clearer. Some are listed below.
1. Begin each sentence with a word, not a mathematical symbol.
The reason is that sentences begin with capital letters, but mathematical
symbols are case sensitive. Because x and X can have entirely different
meanings, putting such symbols at the beginning of a sentence can lead
to ambiguity. Here are some examples of bad usage (marked with ×)
and good usage (marked with X):
A is a subset of B.
The set A is a subset of B.

×

X

x is an integer, so 2x + 5 is an integer.
Because x is an integer, 2x + 5 is an integer.
x2 − x + 2 = 0 has two solutions.
X 2 − x + 2 = 0 has two solutions.
The equation x2 − x + 2 = 0 has two solutions.

a mathematical symbol or expression.

3. Separate mathematical symbols and expressions with words.
Not doing this can cause confusion by making distinct expressions appear
to merge. Compare the clarity of the following examples.
Because x2 − 1 = 0, x = 1 or x = −1.
Because x2 − 1 = 0, it follows that x = 1 or x = −1.

X

Unlike A ∪ B, A ∩ B equals ;.
Unlike A ∪ B, the set A ∩ B equals ;.

X

×

×

4. Avoid misuse of symbols. Symbols such as =, ≤, ⊆, ∈, etc., are not
words. While it is appropriate to use them in mathematical expressions,
they are out of place in other contexts.
Since the two sets are =, one is a subset of the other.
Since the two sets are equal, one is a subset of the other.

×

X

The empty set is a ⊆ of every set.
The empty set is a subset of every set.

×

X

Since a is odd and x odd ⇒ x2 odd, a2 is odd.
Since a is odd and any odd number squared is odd, a2 is odd.

X

×

5. Avoid using unnecessary symbols. Mathematics is confusing enough
without them. Don’t muddy the water even more.
No set X has negative cardinality.
No set has negative cardinality.

×

X

6. Use the first person plural. In mathematical writing, it is common
to use the words “we” and “us” rather than “I,” “you” or “me.” It is as if
the reader and writer are having a conversation, with the writer guiding
the reader through the details of the proof.
7. Use the active voice. This is just a suggestion, but the active voice
makes your writing more lively. (And briefer too.)
The value x = 3 is obtained through division of both sides by 5.
Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 3.

×

X

8. Explain each new symbol. In writing a proof, you must explain the
meaning of every new symbol you introduce. Failure to do this can lead
to ambiguity, misunderstanding and mistakes. For example, consider
the following two possibilities for a sentence in a proof, where a and b
have been introduced on a previous line.

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

Mathematical Writing

135

Since a | b, it follows that b = ac.
Since a | b, it follows that b = ac for some integer c.

×

X

If you use the first form, then the reader may momentarily scan backwards looking for where the c entered into the picture, not realizing at
first that it came from the definition of divides.
9. Watch out for “it.” The pronoun “it” causes confusion when it is
unclear what it refers to. If there is any possibility of confusion, you
should avoid “it.” Here is an example:
Since X ⊆ Y , and 0 < | X |, we see that it is not empty.

×

Is “it” X or Y ? Either one would make sense, but which do we mean?
X

Since X ⊆ Y , and 0 < | X |, we see that Y is not empty.

10. Since, because, as, for, so. In proofs, it is common to use these
words as conjunctions joining two statements, and meaning that one
statement is true and as a consequence the other true. The following
statements all mean that P is true (or assumed to be true) and as a
consequence Q is true also.
Q since P
Since P , Q

Q because P
Because P , Q

Q , as P
As P , Q

Q , for P

P , so Q

Notice that the meaning of these constructions is different from that of
“If P , then Q ,” for they are asserting not only that P implies Q , but also
that P is true. Exercise care in using them. It must be the case that P
and Q are both statements and that Q really does follow from P .
x ∈ N, so Z
x ∈ N, so x ∈ Z

×

X

11. Thus, hence, therefore, consequently. These adverbs precede a
statement that follows logically from previous sentences or clauses. Be
sure that a statement follows them.
Therefore 2k + 1.
Therefore a = 2k + 1.

×

X

12. Clarity is the gold standard of mathematical writing. If you
think breaking a rule makes your writing clearer, then break the rule.
Your mathematical writing will evolve with practice. One of the best
ways to develop a good mathematical writing style is to read other people’s
proofs. Adopt what works and avoid what doesn’t.

Proof by Contradiction

e now explore a third method of proof: proof by contradiction. This
method is not limited to proving just conditional statements—it can
be used to prove any kind of statement whatsoever. The basic idea is to
assume that the statement we want to prove is false, and then show that
this assumption leads to nonsense. We are then led to conclude that we
were wrong to assume the statement was false, so the statement must be
true. As an example, consider the following proposition and its proof.

W

Proposition

If a, b ∈ Z, then a2 − 4b 6= 2.

Proof. Suppose this proposition is false.
This conditional statement being false means there exist numbers a and b
for which a, b ∈ Z is true, but a2 − 4b 6= 2 is false.
In other words, there exist integers a, b ∈ Z for which a2 − 4b = 2.
From this equation we get a2 = 4b + 2 = 2(2b + 1), so a2 is even.
Because a2 is even, it follows that a is even, so a = 2c for some integer c.
Now plug a = 2c back into the boxed equation to get (2c)2 − 4b = 2,
so 4c2 − 4b = 2. Dividing by 2, we get 2c2 − 2b = 1.
Therefore 1 = 2(c2 − b), and because c2 − b ∈ Z, it follows that 1 is even.
We know 1 is not even, so something went wrong.
But all the logic after the first line of the proof is correct, so it must be that
the first line was incorrect. In other words, we were wrong to assume the
proposition was false. Thus the proposition is true.
■
You may be a bit suspicious of this line of reasoning, but in the next
section we will see that it is logically sound. For now, notice that at the end of
the proof we deduced that 1 is even, which conflicts with our knowledge that
1 is odd. In essence, we have obtained the statement (1 is odd)∧ ∼ (1 is odd),
which has the form C ∧ ∼ C . Notice that no matter what statement C is, and
whether or not it is true, the statement C ∧ ∼ C is false. A statement—like
this one—that cannot be true is called a contradiction. Contradictions
play a key role in our new technique.

Proof by Contradiction

6.1 Proving Statements with Contradiction

Let’s now see why the proof on the previous page is logically valid. In that
proof we needed to show that a statement P : (a, b ∈ Z) ⇒ (a2 − 4b 6= 2) was true.
The proof began with the assumption that P was false, that is that ∼ P was
true, and from this we deduced C ∧ ∼ C . In other words we proved that ∼ P
being true forces C ∧ ∼ C to be true, and this means that we proved that the
conditional statement (∼ P) ⇒ (C ∧ ∼ C) is true. To see that this is the same
as proving P is true, look at the following truth table for (∼ P) ⇒ (C ∧ ∼ C).
Notice that the columns for P and (∼ P) ⇒ (C ∧ ∼ C) are exactly the same, so
P is logically equivalent to (∼ P) ⇒ (C ∧ ∼ C).

Therefore to prove a statement P , it suffices to instead prove the conditional
statement (∼ P) ⇒ (C ∧ ∼ C). This can be done with direct proof: Assume
∼ P and deduce C ∧ ∼ C . Here is the outline:

Therefore C ∧ ∼ C .

■

A slightly unsettling feature of this method is that we may not know at
the beginning of the proof what the statement C is going to be. In doing the
scratch work for the proof, you assume that ∼ P is true, then deduce new
statements until you have deduced some statement C and its negation ∼ C .
If this method seems confusing, look at it this way. In the first line of
the proof we suppose ∼ P is true, that is, we assume P is false. But if P is
really true then this contradicts our assumption that P is false. But we
haven’t yet proved P to be true, so the contradiction is not obvious. We use
logic and reasoning to transform the non-obvious contradiction ∼ P to an
obvious contradiction C ∧ ∼ C .

The idea of proof by contradiction is ancient, going back at least to the
Pythagoreans, who used it to prove that certain numbers are irrational.
p
Our next example follows their logic to prove that 2 is irrational. Recall
that a number is rational if it is a fraction of integers, and it is irrational if
it cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers. Here is the exact definition:
Definition 6.1 A real number x is rational if x = ab for some a, b ∈ Z.
Also, x is irrational if it is not rational, that is if x 6= ab for every a, b ∈ Z.
p

We are now ready to use contradiction to prove that 2 is irrational.
According to the outline, the first line of the proof should be “Suppose that
p
it is not true that 2 is irrational.” But it is helpful (though not mandatory)
to tip our reader off to the fact that we are using proof by contradiction.
One standard way of doing this is to make the first line “Suppose for the
p
sake of contradiction that it is not true that 2 is irrational."
Proposition

The number

p
2 is irrational.
p

Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that it is not true that 2 is
p
irrational. Then 2 is rational, so there are integers a and b for which
p
a
2= .
b

(6.1)

Let this fraction be fully reduced; in particular, this means that a and
b are not both even. (If they were both even, then the fraction could be
further reduced by factoring 2’s from the numerator and denominator and
2
canceling.) Squaring both sides of Equation 6.1 gives 2 = ab2 , and therefore
a2 = 2b2 .

(6.2)

From this it follows that a2 is even. But we proved earlier (Exercise 1 on
page 136) that a2 being even implies a is even. Thus, as we know that a
and b are not both even, it follows that b is odd. Now, since a is even there
is an integer c for which a = 2c. Plugging this value for a into Equation (6.2),
we get (2c)2 = 2b2 , so 4c2 = 2b2 , and hence b2 = 2c2 . This means b2 is even,
so b is even also. But previously we deduced that b is odd. Thus we have
the contradiction b is even and b is odd.
■
To appreciate the power of proof by contradiction, imagine trying to
p
prove that 2 is irrational without it. Where would we begin? What would
be our initial assumption? There are no clear answers to these questions.

Proof by contradiction gives us a starting point: Assume 2 is rational, and
work from there.
In the above proof we got the contradiction (b is even) ∧ ∼(b is even) which
has the form C ∧ ∼ C . In general, your contradiction need not necessarily be
of this form. Any statement that is clearly false is sufficient. For example
2 6= 2 would be a fine contradiction, as would be 4 | 2, provided that you could
deduce them.
Here is another ancient example, dating back at least as far as Euclid:
Proposition

There are infinitely many prime numbers.

Proof. For the sake of contradiction, suppose there are only finitely many
prime numbers. Then we can list all the prime numbers as p 1 , p 2 , p 3 , . . . p n ,
where p 1 = 2, p 2 = 3, p 3 = 5, p 4 = 7 and so on. Thus p n is the nth and largest
prime number. Now consider the number a = (p 1 p 2 p 3 · · · p n ) + 1, that is, a is
the product of all prime numbers, plus 1. Now a, like any natural number
greater than 1, has at least one prime divisor, and that means p k | a for at
least one of our n prime numbers p k . Thus there is an integer c for which
a = c p k , which is to say
(p 1 p 2 p 3 · · · p k−1 p k p k+1 · · · p n ) + 1 = c p k .

Dividing both sides of this by p k gives us
(p 1 p 2 p 3 · · · p k−1 p k+1 · · · p n ) +

so

1
= c,
pk

1
= c − (p 1 p 2 p 3 · · · p k−1 p k+1 · · · p n ).
pk

The expression on the right is an integer, while the expression on the left is
not an integer. This is a contradiction.
■
Proof by contradiction often works well in proving statements of the form
∀ x, P(x). The reason is that the proof set-up involves assuming ∼ ∀ x, P(x),
which as we know from Section 2.10 is equivalent to ∃ x, ∼ P(x). This gives
us a specific x for which ∼ P(x) is true, and often that is enough to produce
a contradiction. Here is an example:
Proposition

For every real number x ∈ [0, π/2], we have sin x + cos x ≥ 1.

Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that this is not true.
Then there exists an x ∈ [0, π/2] for which sin x + cos x < 1.

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

Proving Conditional Statements by Contradiction

141

Since x ∈ [0, π/2], neither sin x nor cos x is negative, so 0 ≤ sin x + cos x < 1.
Thus 02 ≤ (sin x + cos x)2 < 12 , which gives 02 ≤ sin2 x + 2 sin x cos x + cos2 x < 12 .
As sin2 x + cos2 x = 1, this becomes 0 ≤ 1 + 2 sin x cos x < 1, so 1 + 2 sin x cos x < 1.
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives 2 sin x cos x < 0.
But this contradicts the fact that neither sin x nor cos x is negative.
■
6.2 Proving Conditional Statements by Contradiction
Since the previous two chapters dealt exclusively with proving conditional
statements, we now formalize the procedure in which contradiction is used
to prove a conditional statement. Suppose we want to prove a proposition
of the following form.
Proposition

If P , then Q .

Thus we need to prove that P ⇒ Q is true. Proof by contradiction begins
with the assumption that ∼ (P ⇒ Q) is true, that is, that P ⇒ Q is false. But
we know that P ⇒ Q being false means that it is possible that P can be true
while Q is false. Thus the first step in the proof is to assume P and ∼ Q .
Here is an outline:
Outline for Proving a Conditional

Proposition

If P , then Q .

Proof. Suppose P and ∼ Q .

.

Therefore C ∧ ∼ C .

■

To illustrate this new technique, we revisit a familiar result: If a2 is
even, then a is even. According to the outline, the first line of the proof
should be “For the sake of contradiction, suppose a2 is even and a is not
even.”
Proposition

Suppose a ∈ Z. If a2 is even, then a is even.

Proof. For the sake of contradiction, suppose a2 is even and a is not even.
Then a2 is even, and a is odd.
Since a is odd, there is an integer c for which a = 2c + 1.
Then a2 = (2c + 1)2 = 4c2 + 4c + 1 = 2(2c2 + 2c) + 1, so a2 is odd.
Thus a2 is even and a2 is not even, a contradiction.

Here is another example.
Proposition

If a, b ∈ Z and a ≥ 2, then a - b or a - (b + 1).

Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction there exist a, b ∈ Z with a ≥ 2,
and for which it is not true that a - b or a - (b + 1).
By DeMorgan’s law, we have a | b and a | (b + 1).
The definition of divisibility says there are c, d ∈ Z with b = ac and b + 1 = ad .
Subtracting one equation from the other gives ad − ac = 1, so a(d − c) = 1.
Since a is positive, d − c is also positive (otherwise a(d − c) would be negative).
Then d − c is a positive integer and a(d − c) = 1, so a = 1/(d − c) < 2.
Thus we have a ≥ 2 and a < 2, a contradiction.
■
6.3 Combining Techniques
Often in more complex proofs several proof techniques are combined within
a single proof. For example, in proving a conditional statement P ⇒ Q , we
might begin with direct proof and thus assume P to be true with the aim of
ultimately showing Q is true. But the truth of Q might hinge on the truth
of some other statement R which—together with P —would imply Q . We
would then need to prove R , and we would use whichever proof technique
seems most appropriate. This can lead to “proofs inside of proofs.” Consider
the following example. The overall approach is direct, but inside the direct
proof is a separate proof by contradiction.
Proposition Every non-zero rational number can be expressed as a product of two irrational numbers.
Proof. This proposition can be reworded as follows: If r is a non-zero rational
number, then r is a product of two irrational numbers. In what follows, we
prove this with direct proof.
Suppose r is a non-zero rational number. Then r = ab for integers a and b.
Also, r can be written as a product of two numbers as follows:
r=

p
of this chapter (or see its solution). Exercise 5 asks you to prove that 3
p
is irrational. This turns out to be slightly trickier than proving that 2 is
irrational.
6.4 Some Words of Advice
Despite the power of proof by contradiction, it’s best to use it only when the
direct and contrapositive approaches do not seem to work. The reason for
this is that a proof by contradiction can often have hidden in it a simpler
contrapositive proof, and if this is the case it’s better to go with the simpler
approach. Consider the following example.
Proposition

Suppose a ∈ Z. If a2 − 2a + 7 is even, then a is odd.

Proof. (Contradiction) Suppose a2 − 2a + 7 is even and a is not odd.
That is, suppose a2 − 2a + 7 is even and a is even.
Since a is even, there is an integer c for which a = 2c.
Then a2 − 2a + 7 = (2c)2 − 2(2c) + 7 = 2(2c2 − 2c + 3) + 1, so a2 − 2a + 7 is odd.
Thus a2 − 2a + 7 is both even and odd, a contradiction.
■
Though there is nothing really wrong with this proof, notice that part
of it assumes a is not odd and deduces that a2 − 2a + 7 is not even. That is
the contrapositive approach! Thus it would be more efficient to proceed as
follows, using contrapositive proof.
Proposition

Suppose a ∈ Z. If a2 − 2a + 7 is even, then a is odd.

Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose a is not odd.
Then a is even, so there is an integer c for which a = 2c.
Then a2 − 2a + 7 = (2c)2 − 2(2c) + 7 = 2(2c2 − 2c + 3) + 1, so a2 − 2a + 7 is odd.
Thus a2 − 2a + 7 is not even.

Proving Non-Conditional Statements

he last three chapters introduced three major proof techniques: direct,
contrapositive and contradiction. These three techniques are used to
prove statements of the form “If P , then Q .” As we know, most theorems
and propositions have this conditional form, or they can be reworded to
have this form. Thus the three main techniques are quite important. But
some theorems and propositions cannot be put into conditional form. For
example, some theorems have form “P if and only if Q .” Such theorems
are biconditional statements, not conditional statements. In this chapter
we examine ways to prove them. In addition to learning how to prove
if-and-only-if theorems, we will also look at two other types of theorems.

T

7.1 If-and-Only-If Proof
Some propositions have the form
P if and only if Q .

We know from Section 2.4 that this statement asserts that both of the
following conditional statements are true:
If P , then Q .
If Q , then P .
So to prove “P if and only if Q ,” we must prove two conditional statements.
Recall from Section 2.4 that Q ⇒ P is called the converse of P ⇒ Q . Thus
we need to prove both P ⇒ Q and its converse. These are both conditional
statements, so we may prove them with either direct, contrapositive or
contradiction proof. Here is an outline:

Let’s start with a very simple example. You already know that an integer
n is odd if and only if n2 is odd, but let’s prove it anyway, just to illustrate
the outline. In this example we prove ( n is odd)⇒(n2 is odd) using direct
proof and (n2 is odd)⇒(n is odd) using contrapositive proof.

Proposition

The integer n is odd if and only if n2 is odd.

Proof. First we show that n being odd implies that n2 is odd. Suppose n
is odd. Then, by definition of an odd number, n = 2a + 1 for some integer a.
Thus n2 = (2a + 1)2 = 4a2 + 4a + 1 = 2(2a2 + 2a) + 1. This expresses n2 as twice
an integer, plus 1, so n2 is odd.
Conversely, we need to prove that n2 being odd implies that n is odd. We
use contrapositive proof. Suppose n is not odd. Then n is even, so n = 2a for
some integer a (by definition of an even number). Thus n2 = (2a)2 = 2(2a2 ),
so n2 is even because it’s twice an integer. Thus n2 is not odd. We’ve now
proved that if n is not odd, then n2 is not odd, and this is a contrapositive
proof that if n2 is odd then n is odd.
■
In proving “P if and only if Q ,” you should begin a new paragraph when
starting the proof of Q ⇒ P . Since this is the converse of P ⇒ Q , it’s a good
idea to begin the paragraph with the word “Conversely” (as we did above) to
remind the reader that you’ve finished the first part of the proof and are
moving on to the second. Likewise, it’s a good idea to remind the reader of
exactly what statement that paragraph is proving.
The next example uses direct proof in both parts of the proof.
Proposition Suppose a and b are integers. Then a ≡ b (mod 6) if and only
if a ≡ b (mod 2) and a ≡ b (mod 3).
Proof. First we prove that if a ≡ b (mod 6), then a ≡ b (mod 2) and a ≡ b
(mod 3). Suppose a ≡ b (mod 6). This means 6 | (a − b), so there is an integer
n for which
a − b = 6n.

From this we get a − b = 2(3n), which implies 2 | (a − b), so a ≡ b (mod 2). But
we also get a − b = 3(2n), which implies 3 | (a − b), so a ≡ b (mod 3). Therefore
a ≡ b (mod 2) and a ≡ b (mod 3).
Conversely, suppose a ≡ b (mod 2) and a ≡ b (mod 3). Since a ≡ b (mod 2)
we get 2 | (a − b), so there is an integer k for which a − b = 2k. Therefore a − b
is even. Also, from a ≡ b (mod 3) we get 3 | (a − b), so there is an integer ` for
which
a − b = 3` .

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

Equivalent Statements

149

But since we know a − b is even, it follows that ` must be even also, for
if it were odd then a − b = 3` would be odd (because a − b would be the
product of two odd integers). Hence ` = 2m for some integer m. Thus
a − b = 3` = 3 · 2m = 6m. This means 6 | (a − b), so a ≡ b (mod 6).
■
Since if-and-only-if proofs simply combine methods with which we are
already familiar, we will not do any further examples in this section. But it
is of utmost importance that you practice your skill on some of this chapter’s
exercises.
7.2 Equivalent Statements
In other courses you will sometimes encounter a certain kind of theorem
that is neither a conditional nor a biconditional statement. Instead, it
asserts that a list of statements is “equivalent.” You saw this (or will see it)
in your linear algebra textbook, which featured the following theorem:
Theorem Suppose A is an n × n matrix. The following statements are
equivalent:
(a) The matrix A is invertible.
(b) The equation Ax = b has a unique solution for every b ∈ Rn .
(c) The equation Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution.
(d) The reduced row echelon form of A is I n .
(e) det(A) 6= 0.
(f) The matrix A does not have 0 as an eigenvalue.
When a theorem asserts that a list of statements is “equivalent,” it is
asserting that either the statements are all true, or they are all false. Thus
the above theorem tells us that whenever we are dealing with a particular
n × n matrix A , then either the statements (a) through (f) are all true for A ,
or statements (a) through (f) are all false for A . For example, if we happen to
know that det(A) 6= 0, the theorem assures us that in addition to statement
(e) being true, all the statements (a) through (f) are true. On the other
hand, if it happens that det(A) = 0, the theorem tells us that all statements
(a) through (f) are false. In this way, the theorem multiplies our knowledge
of A by a factor of six. Obviously that can be very useful.
What method would we use to prove such a theorem? In a certain
sense, the above theorem is like an if-and-only-if theorem. An if-and-only-if
theorem of form P ⇔ Q asserts that P and Q are either both true or both
false, that is, that P and Q are equivalent. To prove P ⇔ Q we prove P ⇒ Q
followed by Q ⇒ P , essentially making a “cycle” of implications from P to Q

150

and back to P . Similarly, one approach to proving the theorem about the
n × n matrix would be to prove the conditional statement (a) ⇒ (b), then
(b) ⇒ (c), then (c) ⇒ (d), then (d) ⇒ (e), then (e) ⇒ ( f ) and finally ( f ) ⇒ (a).
This pattern is illustrated below.
(a) =⇒ (b) =⇒ (c)
⇑
⇓
( f ) ⇐= (e) ⇐= (d)

Notice that if these six implications have been proved, then it really does
follow that the statements (a) through (f) are either all true or all false.
If one of them is true, then the circular chain of implications forces them
all to be true. On the other hand, if one of them (say (c)) is false, the fact
that (b) ⇒ (c) is true forces (b) to be false. This combined with the truth of
(a) ⇒ (b) makes (a) false, and so on counterclockwise around the circle.
Thus to prove that n statements are equivalent, it suffices to prove
n conditional statements showing each statement implies another, in a
circular pattern. But it is not necessary that the pattern be circular. The
following schemes would also do the job:
(a) =⇒ (b) ⇐⇒ (c)
⇑
⇓
( f ) ⇐= (e) ⇐⇒ (d)

(a) ⇐⇒ (b) ⇐⇒ (c)
m
( f ) ⇐⇒ (e) ⇐⇒ (d)

But a circular pattern yields the fewest conditional statements that
must be proved. Whatever the pattern, each conditional statement can be
proved with either direct, contrapositive or contradiction proof.
Though we shall not do any of these proofs in this text, you are sure to
encounter them in subsequent courses.
7.3 Existence Proofs; Existence and Uniqueness Proofs
Up until this point, we have dealt with proving conditional statements
or with statements that can be expressed with two or more conditional
statements. Generally, these conditional statements have form P(x) ⇒ Q(x).
(Possibly with more than one variable.) We saw in Section 2.8 that this can
be interpreted as a universally quantified statement ∀ x, P(x) ⇒ Q(x).

Thus, conditional statements are universally quantified statements,
so in proving a conditional statement—whether we use direct, contrapositive or contradiction proof—we are really proving a universally quantified
statement.
But how would we prove an existentially quantified statement? What
technique would we employ to prove a theorem of the following form?
∃ x, R(x)

This statement asserts that there exists some specific object x for which
R(x) is true. To prove ∃ x, R(x) is true, all we would have to do is find and
display an example of a specific x that makes R(x) true.
Though most theorems and propositions are conditional (or if-andonly-if) statements, a few have the form ∃ x, R(x). Such statements are
called existence statements, and theorems that have this form are called
existence theorems. To prove an existence theorem, all you have to do
is provide a particular example that shows it is true. This is often quite
simple. (But not always!) Here are some examples:
Proposition

There exists an even prime number.

Proof. Observe that 2 is an even prime number.

■

Admittedly, this last proposition was a bit of an oversimplification. The
next one is slightly more challenging.
Proposition There exists an integer that can be expressed as the sum of
two perfect cubes in two different ways.
Proof. Consider the number 1729. Note that 13 + 123 = 1729 and 93 + 103 =
1729. Thus the number 1729 can be expressed as the sum of two perfect
cubes in two different ways.
■
Sometimes in the proof of an existence statement, a little verification is
needed to show that the example really does work. For example, the above
proof would be incomplete if we just asserted that 1729 can be written as a
sum of two cubes in two ways without showing how this is possible.
WARNING: Although an example suffices to prove an existence statement,
a single example does not prove a conditional statement.

Proving Non-Conditional Statements

Often an existence statement will be embedded inside of a conditional
statement. Consider the following. (Recall the definition of gcd on page 116.)
If a, b ∈ N, then there exist integers k and ` for which gcd(a, b) = ak + b`.
This is a conditional statement that has the form
a, b ∈ N =⇒ ∃ k, ` ∈ Z, gcd(a, b) = ak + b`.

To prove it with direct proof, we would first assume that a, b ∈ N, then
prove the existence statement ∃ k, ` ∈ Z, gcd(a, b) = ak + b`. That is, we
would produce two integers k and ` (which depend on a and b) for which
gcd(a, b) = ak + b`. Let’s carry out this plan. (We will use this fundamental
proposition several times later, so it is given a number.)
Proposition 7.1 If a, b ∈ N, then there exist integers k and ` for which
gcd(a, b) = ak + b`.
Proof. (Direct) Suppose a, b ∈ N. Consider the set A = ax + b y : x, y ∈ Z .
This set contains both positive and negative integers, as well as 0. (Reason:
Let y = 0 and let x range over all integers. Then ax + b y = ax ranges over
all multiples of a, both positive, negative and zero.) Let d be the smallest
positive element of A . Then, because d is in A , it must have the form
d = ak + b` for some specific k, ` ∈ Z.
To finish, we will show d = gcd(a, b). We will first argue that d is a
common divisor of a and b, and then that it is the greatest common divisor.
To see that d | a, use the division algorithm (page 30) to write a = qd + r
for integers q and r with 0 ≤ r < d . The equation a = qd + r yields
©

r

=

a − qd

=

a − q(ak + b`)

=

a(1 − qk) + b(− q`).

ª

Therefore r has form r = ax + b y, so it belongs to A . But 0 ≤ r < d and d is the
smallest positive number in A , so r can’t be positive; hence r = 0. Updating
our equation a = qd + r , we get a = qd , so d | a. Repeating this argument
with b = qd + r shows d | b. Thus d is indeed a common divisor of a and b. It
remains to show that it is the greatest common divisor.
As gcd(a, b) divides a and b, we have a = gcd(a, b) · m and b = gcd(a, b) · n for
¡
¢
some m, n ∈ Z. So d = ak + b` = gcd(a, b) · mk + gcd(a, b) · n` = gcd(a, b) mk + n` ,
and thus d is a multiple of gcd(a, b). Therefore d ≥ gcd(a, b). But d can’t be
a larger common divisor of a and b than gcd(a, b), so d = gcd(a, b).

We conclude this section with a discussion of so-called uniqueness proofs.
Some existence statements have form “There is a unique x for which P(x).”
Such a statement asserts that there is exactly one example x for which P(x) is
true. To prove it, you must produce an example x = d for which P(d) is true,
and you must show that d is the only such example. The next proposition
©
ª
illustrates this. In essence, it asserts that the set ax + b y : x, y ∈ Z consists
precisely of all the multiples of gcd(a, b).
Proposition Suppose a, b ∈ N. Then there exists a unique d ∈ N for which:
An integer m is a multiple of d if and only if m = ax + b y for some x, y ∈ Z.
Proof. Suppose a, b ∈ N. Let d = gcd(a, b). We first show that an integer m is
a multiple of d if and only if m = ax + b y for some x, y ∈ Z. Let m = dn be a
multiple of d . By Proposition 7.1 (on the previous page), there are integers
k and ` for which d = ak + b`. Then m = dn = (ak + b`)n = a(kn) + b(` n), so
m = ax + b y for integers x = kn and y = ` n.
Conversely, suppose m = ax + b y for some x, y ∈ Z. Since d = gcd(a, b) is
a divisor of both a and b, we have a = dc and b = de for some c, e ∈ Z. Then
m = ax + b y = dcx + de y = d(cx + e y), and this is a multiple of d .
We have now shown that there is a natural number d with the property
that m is a multiple of d if and only if m = ax + b y for some x, y ∈ Z. It remains
to show that d is the unique such natural number. To do this, suppose d 0 is
any natural number with the property that d has:
m is a multiple of d 0 ⇐⇒ m = ax + b y for some x, y ∈ Z.

(7.1)

We next argue that d 0 = d ; that is, d is the unique natural number with
the stated property. Because of (7.1), m = a · 1 + b · 0 = a is a multiple of d 0 .
Likewise m = a · 0 + b · 1 = b is a multiple of d 0 . Hence a and b are both
multiples of d 0 , so d 0 is a common divisor of a and b, and therefore
d 0 ≤ gcd(a, b) = d.

But also, by (7.1), the multiple m = d 0 · 1 = d 0 of d 0 can be expressed as
d 0 = ax + b y for some x, y ∈ Z. As noted in the second paragraph of the proof,
a = dc and b = de for some c, e ∈ Z. Thus d 0 = ax + b y = dcx + de y = d(cx + e y),
so d 0 is a multiple d . As d 0 and d are both positive, it follows that
d ≤ d0.

We’ve now shown that d 0 ≤ d and d ≤ d 0 , so d = d 0 . The proof is complete. ■

7.4 Constructive Versus Non-Constructive Proofs
Existence proofs fall into two categories: constructive and non-constructive.
Constructive proofs display an explicit example that proves the theorem;
non-constructive proofs prove an example exists without actually giving it.
We illustrate the difference with two proofs of the same fact: There exist
irrational numbers x and y (possibly equal) for which x y is rational.
There exist irrational numbers x, y for which x y is rational.

Proposition

Proof. Let x = 2 and y = 2. We know y is irrational, but it is not clear
whether x is rational or irrational. On one hand, if x is irrational, then we
have an irrational number to an irrational power that is rational:

On the other hand, if x is rational, then y = 2 = x is rational. Either way,
we have an irrational number to an irrational power that is rational.
■
y

The above is a classic example of a non-constructive proof. It shows
that there exist irrational numbers x and y for which x y is rational without
actually
producing
(or constructing) an example. It convinces us that one

or 2 is an irrational number to an irrational power that is
rational, but it does not say which one is the correct example. It thus proves
that an example exists without explicitly stating one.
Next comes a constructive proof of this statement, one that produces
(or constructs) two explicit irrational numbers x, y for which x y is rational.
There exist irrational numbers x, y for which x y is rational.

Proposition

Proof. Let x = 2 and y = log2 9. Then
xy =

As 3 is rational, we have shown that x y = 3 is rational.
p
We know that x = 2 is irrational. The proof will be complete if we can
show that y = log2 9 is irrational. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that
log2 9 is rational, so there are integers a and b for which ab = log2 9. This
¢b

means 2a/b = 9, so 2a/b = 9b , which reduces to 2a = 9b . But 2a is even, while
9b is odd (because it is the product of the odd number 9 with itself b times).
This is a contradiction; the proof is complete.

This existence proof has inside of it a separate proof (by contradiction)
that log2 9 is irrational. Such combinations of proof techniques are, of course,
typical.
Be alert to constructive and non-constructive proofs as you read proofs
in other books and articles, as well as to the possibility of crafting such
proofs of your own.

Proofs Involving Sets

tudents in their first advanced mathematics classes are often surprised
by the extensive role that sets play and by the fact that most of the
proofs they encounter are proofs about sets. Perhaps you’ve already seen
such proofs in your linear algebra course, where a vector space was defined
to be a set of objects (called vectors) that obey certain properties. Your
text proved many things about vector spaces, such as the fact that the
intersection of two vector spaces is also a vector space, and the proofs used
ideas from set theory. As you go deeper into mathematics, you will encounter
more and more ideas, theorems and proofs that involve sets. The purpose
of this chapter is to give you a foundation that will prepare you for this new
outlook.
We will discuss how to show that an object is an element of a set, how to
prove one set is a subset of another and how to prove two sets are equal. As
you read this chapter you may need to occasionally refer back to Chapter 1
to refresh your memory. For your convenience, the main definitions from
Chapter 1 are summarized below. If A and B are sets, then

8.1 How to Prove a ∈ A
We will begin with a review of set-builder notation, and then review how to
show that a given object a is an element of some set A .

ª

Generally, a set A will be expressed in set-builder notation A = x : P(x) ,
where P(x) is some open sentence about x. The set A is understood to have
as elements all those things x for which P(x) is true. For example,
©

ª ©
ª
x : x is an odd integer = . . . , −5, −3, −1, 1, 3, 5, . . . .
©

ª

A common variation of this notation is to express a set as A = x ∈ S : P(x) .
Here it is understood that A consists of all elements x of the (predetermined)
set S for which P(x) is true. Keep in mind that, depending on context, x
could be any kind of object (integer, ordered pair, set, function, etc.). There is
also nothing special about the particular variable x; any reasonable symbol
x, y, k, etc., would do. Some examples follow.

Now it should be clear how to prove that an object a belongs to a set x : P(x) .
©
ª
Since x : P(x) consists of all things x for which P(x) is true, to show that
©
ª
a ∈ x : P(x) we just need to show that P(a) is true. Likewise, to show
©
ª
a ∈ x ∈ S : P(x) , we need to confirm that a ∈ S and that P(a) is true. These
ideas are summarized below. However, you should not memorize these
methods, you should understand them. With contemplation and practice,
using them becomes natural and intuitive.

21 ∈ A because P(21) is true. Similarly, 7, 14, 28, 35, etc., are all elements of
A . But 8 ∉ A (for example) because P(8) is false. Likewise −14 ∉ A because
P(−14) is false.

How to Prove A ⊆ B

159

Example 8.3 Consider the set B = (x, y) ∈ Z × Z : x ≡ y (mod 5) . Notice
(8, 23) ∈ B because (8, 23) ∈ Z × Z and 8 ≡ 23 (mod 5). Likewise, (100, 75) ∈ B,
(102, 77) ∈ B, etc., but (6, 10) ∉ B.
Now suppose n ∈ Z and consider the ordered pair (4n + 3, 9n − 2). Does this
ordered pair belong to B? To answer this, we first observe that
(4n + 3, 9n − 2) ∈ Z × Z. Next, we observe that (4n + 3) − (9n − 2) = −5n + 5 = 5(1 − n),
¡
¢
so 5 | (4n + 3) − (9n − 2) , which means (4n + 3) ≡ (9n − 2) (mod 5). Therefore we
have established that (4n + 3, 9n − 2) meets the requirements for belonging
to B, so (4n + 3, 9n − 2) ∈ B for every n ∈ Z.

Example 8.4 This illustrates another common way of defining a set.
©
ª
Consider the set C = 3x3 + 2 : x ∈ Z . Elements of this set consist of all the
values 3x3 + 2 where x is an integer. Thus −22 ∈ C because −22 = 3(−2)3 + 2.
You can confirm −1 ∈ C and 5 ∈ C , etc. Also 0 ∉ C and 12 ∉ C , etc.
8.2 How to Prove A ⊆ B
In this course (and more importantly, beyond it) you will encounter many
circumstances where it is necessary to prove that one set is a subset of another. This section explains how to do this. The methods we discuss should
improve your skills in both writing your own proofs and in comprehending
the proofs that you read.
Recall (Definition 1.3) that if A and B are sets, then A ⊆ B means that
every element of A is also an element of B. In other words, it means if a ∈ A ,
then a ∈ B. Therefore to prove that A ⊆ B, we just need to prove that the
conditional statement
“If a ∈ A , then a ∈ B”
is true. This can be proved directly, by assuming a ∈ A and deducing a ∈ B.
The contrapositive approach is another option: Assume a ∉ B and deduce
a ∉ A . Each of these two approaches is outlined below.
How to Prove A ⊆ B
(Direct approach)
Proof. Suppose a ∈ A .

How to Prove A ⊆ B
(Contrapositive approach)

Therefore a ∈ B.

In practice, the direct approach usually yields the most straightforward
and easy proof, though occasionally the contrapositive is the most expedient.
(You can even prove A ⊆ B by contradiction: Assume (a ∈ A) ∧ (a ∉ B), and
deduce a contradiction.) The remainder of this section consists of examples
with occasional commentary. Unless stated otherwise, we will use the direct
approach in all proofs; pay special attention to how the above outline for
the direct approach is used.

Proof. Suppose a ∈ x ∈ Z : 18 | x .
This means that a ∈ Z and 18 | a.
By definition of divisibility, there is an integer c for which a = 18c.
Consequently a = 6(3c), and from this we deduce that 6 | a.

Therefore a is one of the integers that 6 divides, so a ∈ x ∈ Z : 6 | x .

Proof. Suppose a ∈ x ∈ Z : 2 | x ∩ x ∈ Z : 9 | x .
©
ª
©
ª
By definition of intersection, this means a ∈ x ∈ Z : 2 | x and a ∈ x ∈ Z : 9 | x .
©
ª
Since a ∈ x ∈ Z : 2 | x we know 2 | a, so a = 2c for some c ∈ Z. Thus a is even.
©
ª
Since a ∈ x ∈ Z : 9 | x we know 9 | a, so a = 9d for some d ∈ Z.
As a is even, a = 9d implies d is even. (Otherwise a = 9d would be odd.)
Then d = 2e for some integer e, and we have a = 9d = 9(2e) = 6(3e).
©
ª
From a = 6(3e), we conclude 6 | a, and this means a ∈ x ∈ Z : 6 | x .

We have shown that a ∈ x ∈ Z : 2 | x ∩ x ∈ Z : 9 | x implies a ∈ x ∈ Z : 6 | x ,

How to Prove A ⊆ B

161

Some statements involving subsets are transparent enough that we
often accept (and use) them without proof. For example, if A and B are any
sets, then it’s very easy to confirm A ∩ B ⊆ A . (Reason: Suppose x ∈ A ∩ B.
Then x ∈ A and x ∈ B by definition of intersection, so in particular x ∈ A .
Thus x ∈ A ∩ B implies x ∈ A , so A ∩ B ⊆ A .) Other statements of this nature
include A ⊆ A ∪ B and A − B ⊆ A , as well as conditional statements such as
¡
¢
(A ⊆ B) ∧ (B ⊆ C) ⇒ (A ⊆ C) and (X ⊆ A) ⇒ (X ⊆ A ∪ B). Our point of view in
this text is that we do not need to prove such obvious statements unless
we are explicitly asked to do so in an exercise. (Still, you should do some
quick mental proofs to convince yourself that the above statements are true.
If you don’t see that A ∩ B ⊆ A is true but that A ⊆ A ∩ B is not necessarily
true, then you need to spend more time on this topic.)
The next example will show that if A and B are sets, then P (A) ∪ P (B) ⊆
P (A ∪ B). Before beginning our proof, let’s look at an example to see if this

statement really makes sense. Suppose A = 1, 2 and B = 2, 3 . Then
P (A) ∪ P (B) =

= ;, 1 , 2 , 3 , 1, 2 , 2, 3 .

Also P (A ∪ B) = P ( 1, 2, 3 ) = ;, 1 , 2 , 3 , 1, 2 , 2, 3 , 1, 3 , 1, 2, 3 . Thus,
even though P (A) ∪ P (B) 6= P (A ∪ B), it is true that P (A) ∪ P (B) ⊆ P (A ∪ B)
for this particular A and B. Now let’s prove P (A) ∪ P (B) ⊆ P (A ∪ B) no
matter what sets A and B are.

Prove that if A and B are sets, then P (A) ∪ P (B) ⊆ P (A ∪ B).

Proof. Suppose X ∈ P (A) ∪ P (B).
By definition of union, this means X ∈ P (A) or X ∈ P (B).
Therefore X ⊆ A or X ⊆ B (by definition of power sets). We consider cases.
Case 1. Suppose X ⊆ A . Then X ⊆ A ∪ B, and this means X ∈ P (A ∪ B).
Case 2. Suppose X ⊆ B. Then X ⊆ A ∪ B, and this means X ∈ P (A ∪ B).
(We do not need to consider the case where X ⊆ A and X ⊆ B because that
is taken care of by either of cases 1 or 2.) The above cases show that
X ∈ P (A ∪ B).
Thus we’ve shown that X ∈ P (A) ∪ P (B) implies X ∈ P (A ∪ B), and this
completes the proof that P (A) ∪ P (B) ⊆ P (A ∪ B).

In our next example, we prove a conditional statement. Direct proof is
used, and in the process we use our new technique for showing A ⊆ B.

Example 8.9 Suppose A and B are sets. If P (A) ⊆ P (B), then A ⊆ B.
Proof. We use direct proof. Assume P (A) ⊆ P (B).
Based on this assumption, we must now show that A ⊆ B.
To show A ⊆ B, suppose that a ∈ A .

Then the one-element set a is a subset of A , so a ∈ P (A).

8.3 How to Prove A = B
In proofs it is often necessary to show that two sets are equal. There is a
standard way of doing this. Suppose we want to show A = B. If we show
A ⊆ B, then every element of A is also in B, but there is still a possibility
that B could have some elements that are not in A , so we can’t conclude
A = B. But if in addition we also show B ⊆ A , then B can’t contain anything
that is not in A , so A = B. This is the standard procedure for proving A = B:
Prove both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A .
How to Prove A = B
Proof.
[Prove that A ⊆ B.]
[Prove that B ⊆ A .]
Therefore, since A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A ,
it follows that A = B.

©
ª
a ∈ n ∈ Z : 35 | n . This means 35 | a, so a = 35c for some c ∈ Z. Thus a = 5(7c)
©
ª
and a = 7(5c). From a = 5(7c) it follows that 5 | a, so a ∈ n ∈ Z : 5 | n . From
©
ª
a = 7(5c) it follows that 7 | a, which means a ∈ n ∈ Z : 7 | n . As a belongs to

©
ª
©

both n ∈ Z : 5 | n and n ∈ Z : 7 | n , we get a ∈ n ∈ Z : 5 | n ∩ n ∈ Z : 7 | n . Thus

we’ve shown that n ∈ Z : 35 | n ⊆ n ∈ Z : 5 | n ∩ n ∈ Z : 7 | n .

Next we show n ∈ Z : 5 | n ∩ n ∈ Z : 7 | n ⊆ n ∈ Z : 35 | n . Suppose that

a ∈ n ∈ Z : 5 | n ∩ n ∈ Z : 7 | n . By definition of intersection, this means that

©
ª
a ∈ n ∈ Z : 5 | n and a ∈ n ∈ Z : 7 | n . Therefore it follows that 5 | a and 7 | a.

You know from algebra that if c 6= 0 and ac = bc, then a = b. The next
example shows that an analogous statement holds for sets A, B and C . The
example asks us to prove a conditional statement. We will prove it with
direct proof. In carrying out the process of direct proof, we will have to use
the new techniques from this section.
Example 8.11 Suppose A , B, and C are sets, and C 6= ;. Prove that if
A × C = B × C , then A = B.
Proof. Suppose A × C = B × C . We must now show A = B.
First we will show A ⊆ B. Suppose a ∈ A . Since C 6= ;, there exists
an element c ∈ C . Thus, since a ∈ A and c ∈ C , we have (a, c) ∈ A × C , by
definition of the Cartesian product. But then, since A × C = B × C , it follows
that (a, c) ∈ B × C . But (a, c) ∈ B × C means a ∈ B, by definition of the Cartesian
product. We have shown a ∈ A implies a ∈ B, so A ⊆ B.
Next we show B ⊆ A . We use the same argument as above, with the roles
of A and B reversed. Suppose a ∈ B. Since C 6= ;, there exists an element
c ∈ C . Thus, since a ∈ B and c ∈ C , we have (a, c) ∈ B × C . But then, since
B × C = A × C , we have (a, c) ∈ A × C . It follows that a ∈ A . We have shown
a ∈ B implies a ∈ A , so B ⊆ A .
The previous two paragraphs have shown A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A , so A = B. In
summary, we have shown that if A × C = B × C , then A = B. This completes
the proof.
■
Now we’ll look at another way that set operations are similar to operations on numbers. From algebra you are familiar with the distributive
property a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c. Replace the numbers a, b, c with sets A, B, C,
and replace · with × and + with ∩. We get A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C). This
statement turns out to be true, as we now prove.
Example 8.12

Given sets A , B and C , prove A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C).

Proof. First we will show that A × (B ∩ C) ⊆ (A × B) ∩ (A × C).
Suppose (a, b) ∈ A × (B ∩ C).
By definition of the Cartesian product, this means a ∈ A and b ∈ B ∩ C .
By definition of intersection, it follows that b ∈ B and b ∈ C .

Proofs Involving Sets

164

Thus, since a ∈ A and b ∈ B, it follows that (a, b) ∈ A × B (by definition of ×).
Also, since a ∈ A and b ∈ C , it follows that (a, b) ∈ A × C (by definition of ×).
Now we have (a, b) ∈ A × B and (a, b) ∈ A × C , so (a, b) ∈ (A × B) ∩ (A × C).
We’ve shown that (a, b) ∈ A × (B ∩ C) implies (a, b) ∈ (A × B) ∩ (A × C) so we have
A × (B ∩ C) ⊆ (A × B) ∩ (A × C).
Next we will show that (A × B) ∩ (A × C) ⊆ A × (B ∩ C).
Suppose (a, b) ∈ (A × B) ∩ (A × C).
By definition of intersection, this means (a, b) ∈ A × B and (a, b) ∈ A × C .
By definition of the Cartesian product, (a, b) ∈ A × B means a ∈ A and b ∈ B.
By definition of the Cartesian product, (a, b) ∈ A × C means a ∈ A and b ∈ C .
We now have b ∈ B and b ∈ C , so b ∈ B ∩ C , by definition of intersection.
Thus we’ve deduced that a ∈ A and b ∈ B ∩ C , so (a, b) ∈ A × (B ∩ C).
In summary, we’ve shown that (a, b) ∈ (A × B)∩(A × C) implies (a, b) ∈ A ×(B ∩ C)
so we have (A × B) ∩ (A × C) ⊆ A × (B ∩ C).
The previous two paragraphs show that A × (B ∩ C) ⊆ (A × B) ∩ (A × C) and
(A × B) ∩ (A × C) ⊆ A × (B ∩ C), so it follows that (A × B) ∩ (A × C) = A × (B ∩ C). ■
Occasionally you can prove two sets are equal by working out a series of
equalities leading from one set to the other. This like showing two algebraic
expressions are equal by manipulating one until you obtain the other. We
illustrate this in the following example, which gives an alternate solution
to the previous example. This approach is sometimes not applicable (or
awkward), but when it works it can shorten a proof dramatically.
A quick note before beginning the example. Notice that any statement P
is logically equivalent to P ∧ P . (Write out a truth table if you are in doubt.)
At one point in the following example we will replace the expression x ∈ A
with the logically equivalent statement (x ∈ A) ∧ (x ∈ A).
Example 8.13

Given sets A , B, and C , prove A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C).

Proof. Just observe the following sequence of equalities.

It is very good practice to prove these equations. Depending on your

don’t forget them entirely. They may be useful later in your mathematical
work. If so, you can look them up or re-derive them on the spot. If you go
on to study mathematics deeply, you will at some point realize that you’ve
internalized them without even being cognizant of it.
8.4 Examples: Perfect Numbers
Sometimes it takes a good bit of work and creativity to show that one set
is a subset of another or that they are equal. We illustrate this now with
examples from number theory involving what are called perfect numbers.
Even though this topic is quite old, dating back more than 2000 years, it
leads to some questions that are unanswered even today.
The problem involves adding up the positive divisors of a natural number.
To begin the discussion, consider the number 12. If we add up the positive
divisors of 12 that are less than 12, we obtain 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is
greater than 12. Doing the same thing for 15, we get 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is
less than 15. For the most part, given a natural number p, the sum of its
positive divisors less than itself will either be greater than p or less than p.
But occasionally the divisors add up to exactly p. If this happens, then p is
said to be a perfect number.
Definition 8.1 A number p ∈ N is perfect if it equals the sum of its
positive divisors less than itself. Some examples follow.
• The number 6 is perfect since 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.
• The number 28 is perfect since 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
• The number 496 is perfect since 496 = 1+2+4+8+16+31+62+124+248.

166

Though it would take a while to find it by trial-and-error, the next perfect
number after 496 is 8128. You can check that 8128 is perfect. Its divisors
are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127, 254, 508, 1016, 2032, 4064 and indeed
8128 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 127 + 254 + 508 + 1016 + 2032 + 4064.

Are there other perfect numbers? How can they be found? Do they obey any
patterns? These questions fascinated the ancient Greek mathematicians.
In what follows we will develop an idea—recorded by Euclid—that partially
answers these questions. Euclid lived millennia before set theory was even
invented, so he certainly did not use sets. Nonetheless we will phrase his
idea in the language of sets.
Since our goal is to understand what numbers are perfect, let’s define
the following set:
©
ª
P = p ∈ N : p is perfect .
©

ª

Therefore P = 6, 28, 496, 8128, . . . , but it is unclear what numbers are in P
other than the ones listed. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of
just which numbers the set P includes. To do this, we will examine the
following set A . It looks more complicated than P , but it will be very helpful
for understanding P , as we will soon see.

A = 2n−1 (2n − 1) : n ∈ N, and 2n − 1 is prime

In words, A consists of every natural number of form 2n−1 (2n − 1), where
2n − 1 is prime. To get a feel for what numbers belong to A , look at the
following table. For each natural number n, it tallies the corresponding
numbers 2n−1 and 2n − 1. If 2n − 1 happens to be prime, then the product
2n−1 (2n − 1) is given; otherwise that entry is labeled with an ∗.

Examples: Perfect Numbers

167

Notice that the first four entries of A are the perfect numbers 6, 28, 496
and 8128. At this point you may want to jump to the conclusion that A = P .
But it is a shocking fact that in over 2000 years no one has ever been able
to determine whether or not A = P . But it is known that A ⊆ P , and we will
now prove it. In other words, we are going to show that every element of A
is perfect. (But by itself, that leaves open the possibility that there may be
some perfect numbers in P that are not in A .)
The main ingredient for the proof will be the formula for the sum of a
geometric series with common ratio r . You probably saw this most recently
in Calculus II. The formula is

(See the solution for Exercise 19 in Section 7.4 for a proof of this formula.)
Now we are ready to prove our result. Let’s draw attention to its significance
by calling it a theorem rather than a proposition.
Theorem 8.1 If A = 2n−1 (2n − 1) : n ∈ N, and 2n − 1 is prime and P =

p ∈ N : p is perfect , then A ⊆ P .

Proof. Assume A and P are as stated. To show A ⊆ P , we must show that
p ∈ A implies p ∈ P . Thus suppose p ∈ A . By definition of A , this means
p = 2n−1 (2n − 1)

(8.2)

for some n ∈ N for which 2n − 1 is prime. We want to show that p ∈ P , that is,
we want to show p is perfect. Thus, we need to show that the sum of the
positive divisors of p that are less than p add up to p. Notice that since 2n − 1
is prime, any divisor of p = 2n−1 (2n − 1) must have the form 2k or 2k (2n − 1)
for 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Thus the positive divisors of p are as follows:
20 ,

Notice that this list starts with 20 = 1 and ends with 2n−1 (2n − 1) = p.

This shows that the positive divisors of p that are less than p add up to
p. Therefore p is perfect, by definition of a perfect number. Thus p ∈ P , by
definition of P .
We have shown that p ∈ A implies p ∈ P , which means A ⊆ P .
■
Combined with the chart on the previous page, this theorem gives us
a new perfect number! The element p = 213−1 (213 − 1) = 33, 550, 336 in A is
perfect.
Observe also that every element of A is a multiple of a power of 2, and
therefore even. But this does not necessarily mean every perfect number
is even, because we’ve only shown A ⊆ P , not A = P . For all we know there
may be odd perfect numbers in P − A that are not in A .
Are there any odd perfect numbers? No one knows.
In over 2000 years, no one has ever found an odd perfect number, nor
has anyone been able to prove that there are none. But it is known that the
set A does contain every even perfect number. This fact was first proved by
Euler, and we duplicate his reasoning in the next theorem, which proves
that A = E , where E is the set of all even perfect numbers. It is a good
example of how to prove two sets are equal.
For convenience, we are going to use a slightly different definition of a
perfect number. A number p ∈ N is perfect if its positive divisors add up
to 2p. For example, the number 6 is perfect since the sum of its divisors is
1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 2 · 6. This definition is simpler than the first one because we do
not have to stipulate that we are adding up the divisors that are less than
p. Instead we add in the last divisor p, and that has the effect of adding an
additional p, thereby doubling the answer.

©
ª
p ∈ N : p is perfect and even , then A = E .
©

ª

Proof. To show that A = E , we need to show A ⊆ E and E ⊆ A .
First we will show that A ⊆ E . Suppose p ∈ A . This means p is even,
because the definition of A shows that every element of A is a multiple of
a power of 2. Also, p is a perfect number because Theorem 8.1 states that
every element of A is also an element of P , hence perfect. Thus p is an even
perfect number, so p ∈ E . Therefore A ⊆ E .
Next we show that E ⊆ A . Suppose p ∈ E . This means p is an even
perfect number. Write the prime factorization of p as p = 2k 3n1 5n2 7n3 . . .,
where some of the powers n1 , n2 , n3 . . . may be zero. But, as p is even, the
power k must be greater than zero. It follows p = 2k q for some positive
integer k and an odd integer q. Now, our aim is to show that p ∈ A , which
means we must show p has form p = 2n−1 (2n − 1). To get our current p = 2k q
closer to this form, let n = k + 1, so we now have
p = 2n−1 q.

From this we see that 2nq−1 is an integer. It follows that both q and 2nq−1 are
positive divisors of q. Since their sum equals the sum of all positive divisors
of q, it follows that q has only two positive divisors, q and 2nq−1 . Since one
of its divisors must be 1, it must be that 2nq−1 = 1, which means q = 2n − 1.
Now a number with just two positive divisors is prime, so q = 2n − 1 is prime.
Plugging this into Equation (8.3) gives p = 2n−1 (2n − 1), where 2n − 1 is prime.
This means p ∈ A , by definition of A . We have now shown that p ∈ E implies
p ∈ A , so E ⊆ A .
Since A ⊆ E and E ⊆ A , it follows that A = E .

Do not be alarmed if you feel that you wouldn’t have thought of this
proof. It took the genius of Euler to discover this approach.
We’ll conclude this chapter with some facts about perfect numbers.
• The sixth perfect number is p = 217−1 (217 − 1) = 8589869056.
• The seventh perfect number is p = 219−1 (219 − 1) = 137438691328.
• The eighth perfect number is p = 231−1 (231 − 1) = 2305843008139952128.
• The twentieth perfect number is p = 24423−1 (24423 − 1). It has 2663 digits.
• The twenty-third perfect number p = 211,213−1 (211,213 − 1) has 6957 digits.
• The fiftieth perfect number is p = 277,232,917−1 (277,232,917 − 1).
As mentioned earlier, no one knows whether or not there are any odd
perfect numbers. It is not even known whether there are finitely many or
infinitely many perfect numbers. It is known that the last digit of every
even perfect number is either a 6 or an 8. Perhaps this is something you’d
enjoy proving.
We’ve seen that perfect numbers are closely related to prime numbers
having the form 2n − 1. Such prime numbers are called Mersenne primes,
after the French scholar Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), who popularized
them. The first several Mersenne primes are 22 − 1 = 3, 23 − 1 = 7, 25 − 1 = 31,
27 − 1 = 127 and 213 − 1 = 8191. To date, only 51 Mersenne primes are known,
the largest of which is 282,589,933 − 1. There is a substantial cash prize for
anyone who finds a 52nd. (See https://www.mersenne.org/.) You may have
better luck with the exercises.

CHAPTER 9

Disproof

ver since Chapter 4 we have dealt with one major theme: Given a
statement, prove that is it true. In every example and exercise we
were handed a true statement and charged with the task of proving it. Have
you ever wondered what would happen if you were given a false statement
to prove? The answer is that no (correct) proof would be possible, for if it
were, the statement would be true, not false.
But how would you convince someone that a statement is false? The
mere fact that you could not produce a proof does not automatically mean
the statement is false, for you know (perhaps all too well) that proofs can
be difficult to construct. It turns out that there is a very simple and utterly
convincing procedure that proves a statement is false. The process of carrying out this procedure is called disproof. Thus, this chapter is concerned
with disproving statements.
Before describing the new method, we will set the stage with some
relevant background information. First, we point out that mathematical
statements can be divided into three categories, described below.
One category consists of all those statements that have been proved to be
true. For the most part we regard these statements as significant enough to
be designated with special names such as “theorem,” “proposition,” “lemma”
and “corollary.” Some examples of statements in this category are listed
in the left-hand box in the diagram on the following page. There are also
some wholly uninteresting statements (such as 2 = 2) in this category, and
although we acknowledge their existence we certainly do not dignify them
with terms such as “theorem” or “proposition.”
At the other extreme is a category consisting of statements that are
known to be false. Examples are listed in the box on the right. Since
mathematicians are not very interested in them, these types of statements
do not get any special names, other than the blanket term “false statement.”
But there is a third (and quite interesting) category between these
two extremes. It consists of statements whose truth or falsity has not
been determined. Examples include things like “Every perfect number

E

173
is even,” or “Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.”
(The latter statement is called the Goldbach conjecture. See Section 2.1.)
Mathematicians have a special name for the statements in this category
that they suspect (but haven’t yet proved) are true. Such statements are
called conjectures.

Mathematicians spend much of their time and energy attempting to
prove or disprove conjectures. (They also expend considerable mental energy
in creating new conjectures based on collected evidence or intuition.) When
a conjecture is proved (or disproved) the proof or disproof will typically
appear in a published paper, provided the conjecture is of sufficient interest.
If it is proved, the conjecture attains the status of a theorem or proposition.
If it is disproved, then no one is really very interested in it anymore—
mathematicians do not care much for false statements. (Though some
disproved conjectures are viewed as instructive examples or curiosities,
especially if the conjecture had been considered significant.)
Most conjectures that mathematicians are interested in are quite
difficult to prove or disprove. We are not at that level yet. In this text,
the “conjectures” that you will encounter are the kinds of statements that
an experienced mathematician would immediately spot as true or false, but
you may have to do some work before figuring out a proof or disproof. But
in keeping with the cloud of uncertainty that surrounds conjectures at the
advanced levels of mathematics, most exercises in this chapter (and many
beyond it) will ask you to prove or disprove statements without giving any
hint as to whether they are true or false. Your job will be to decide whether
or not they are true and to either prove or disprove them. The examples

in this chapter will illustrate the processes one typically goes through in
deciding whether a statement is true or false, and then verifying that it’s
true or false.
You know the three major methods of proving a statement: direct proof,
contrapositive proof and proof by contradiction. Now we are ready to understand the method of disproving a statement. Suppose you want to disprove
a statement P . In other words you want to prove that P is false. The way to
do this is to prove that ∼ P is true, for if ∼ P is true, it follows immediately
that P has to be false.
How to disprove P :

Prove ∼ P .

Our approach is incredibly simple. To disprove P , prove ∼ P . In theory,
this proof can be carried out by the direct, contrapositive or contradiction
approaches. However, in practice things can be even easier than that if we
are disproving a universally quantified statement or a conditional statement.
That is our next topic.
9.1 Disproving Universal Statements: Counterexamples
A conjecture may be described as a statement that we hope is a theorem.
As we know, many theorems (hence many conjectures) are universally quantified statements. Thus it seems reasonable to begin our discussion by
investigating how to disprove a universally quantified statement such as
∀ x ∈ S, P(x).

To disprove this statement, we must prove its negation. Its negation is
∼ (∀ x ∈ S, P(x)) = ∃ x ∈ S, ∼ P(x).

The negation is an existence statement. To prove the negation is true, we
just need to produce an example of an x ∈ S that makes ∼ P(x) true, that is,
an x that makes P(x) false. This leads to the following outline for disproving
a universally quantified statement.
How to disprove ∀ x ∈ S, P(x).
Produce an example of an x ∈ S
that makes P(x) false.

Counterexamples

175

Things are just as simple if we want to disprove a conditional statement
P(x) ⇒ Q(x). This statement asserts that for every x that makes P(x) true,
Q(x) will also be true. The statement can only be false if there is an x that
makes P(x) true and Q(x) false. This leads to our next outline for disproof.

How to disprove P(x) ⇒ Q(x).
Produce an example of an x that
makes P(x) true and Q(x) false.
In both of the above outlines, the statement is disproved simply by
exhibiting an example that shows the statement is not always true. (Think
of it as an example that exposes the statement as a promise that can be
broken.) There is a special name for an example that disproves a statement:
It is called a counterexample.
Example 9.1 As our first example, we will work through the process of
deciding whether or not the following conjecture is true.
Conjecture

For every n ∈ Z, the integer f (n) = n2 − n + 11 is prime.

In resolving the truth or falsity of a conjecture, it’s a good idea to gather
as much information about the conjecture as possible. In this case let’s
start by making a table that tallies the values of f (n) for some integers n.

In every case, f (n) is prime, so you may begin to suspect that the conjecture
is true. Before attempting a proof, let’s try one more n. Unfortunately,
f (11) = 112 − 11 + 11 = 112 is not prime. The conjecture is false because n = 11
is a counterexample. We summarize our disproof as follows:
Disproof. The statement “For every n ∈ Z, the integer f (n) = n2 − n + 11 is
prime,” is false. For a counterexample, note that for n = 11, the integer
f (11) = 121 = 11 · 11 is not prime.
■
In disproving a statement with a counterexample, it is important to explain
exactly how the counterexample makes the statement false. Our work would
not have been complete if we had just said “for a counterexample, consider
n = 11,” and left it at that. We need to show that the answer f (11) is not
prime. Showing the factorization f (11) = 11 · 11 suffices for this.

Let A = 1, 2, 3 , B = 1, 2 and C = 2, 3 . Notice that A − (B ∩ C) = 1, 3 and
(A − B) ∩ (A − C) = ;, so A − (B ∩ C) 6= (A − B) ∩ (A − C).
■
(To see where this counterexample came from, draw Venn diagrams for
A − (B ∩ C) and (A − B) ∩ (A − C). You will see that the diagrams are different.
The numbers 1, 2 and 3 can then be inserted into the regions of the diagrams
in such a way as to create the above counterexample.)
9.2 Disproving Existence Statements
We have seen that we can disprove a universally quantified statement or a
conditional statement simply by finding a counterexample. Now let’s turn
to the problem of disproving an existence statement such as
∃ x ∈ S, P(x).

Proving this would involve simply finding an example of an x that makes
P(x) true. To disprove it, we have to prove its negation ∼ (∃ x ∈ S, P(x)) =
∀ x ∈ S, ∼ P(x). But this negation is universally quantified. Proving it involves
showing that ∼ P(x) is true for all x ∈ S , and for this an example does not
suffice. Instead we must use direct, contrapositive or contradiction proof to
prove the conditional statement “If x ∈ S , then ∼ P(x).” As an example, here
is a conjecture to either prove or disprove.
Example 9.3 Either prove or disprove the following conjecture.
Conjecture There is a real number x for which x4 < x < x2 .
This may not seem like an unreasonable statement at first glance. After all,
if the statement were asserting the existence of a real number for which
x3 < x < x2 , then it would be true: just take x = −2. But it asserts there
is an x for which x4 < x < x2 . When we apply some intelligent guessing to
locate such an x we run into trouble. If x = 12 , then x4 < x, but we don’t have
x < x2 ; similarly if x = 2, we have x < x2 but not x4 < x. Since finding an x
with x4 < x < x2 seems problematic, we may begin to suspect that the given
statement is false.
Let’s see if we can disprove it. According to our strategy for disproof,
to disprove it we must prove its negation. Symbolically, the statement is

Richard Hammack

Disproving Existence Statements

177

∃ x ∈ R, x4 < x < x2 , so its negation is
∼ (∃ x ∈ R, x4 < x < x2 ) = ∀ x ∈ R, ∼ (x4 < x < x2 ).

Thus, in words the negation is
For every real number x, it is not the case that x4 < x < x2 .
This can be proved with contradiction, as follows. Suppose for the sake of
contradiction that there is an x for which x4 < x < x2 . Then x must be positive
since it’s greater than the non-negative number x4 . Dividing all parts of
x4 < x < x2 by the positive number x produces x3 < 1 < x. Now subtract 1 from
all parts of x3 < 1 < x to obtain x3 − 1 < 0 < x − 1 and reason as follows:
x3 − 1 < 0 <

x−1

2

(x − 1)(x + x + 1) < 0 < (x − 1)
x2 + x + 1 < 0 < 1

(Division by x − 1 did not reverse the inequality < because the second line
above shows 0 < x − 1, that is, x − 1 is positive.) Now we have x2 + x + 1 < 0,
which is a contradiction because x being positive forces x2 + x + 1 > 0.
We summarize our work as follows.
The statement “There is a real number x for which x4 < x < x2 ” is false
because we have proved its negation “For every real number x, it is not the
case that x4 < x < x2 .”
As you work the exercises, keep in mind that not every conjecture will be
false. If one is true, then a disproof is impossible and you must produce a
proof. Here is an example:
Example 9.4

Either prove or disprove the following conjecture.

Conjecture There exist three integers x, y, z, all greater than 1 and no
two equal, for which x y = y z .
This conjecture is true. It is an existence statement, so to prove it we
just need to give an example of three integers x, y, z, all greater than 1 and
no two equal, so that x y = y z . A proof follows.
Proposition There exist three integers x, y, z, all greater than 1 and no
two equal, for which x y = y z .
Proof. Note that if x = 2, y = 16 and z = 4, then x y = 216 = (24 )4 = 164 = y z .

9.3 Disproof by Contradiction

Contradiction can be a very useful way to disprove a statement. To see how
this works, suppose we wish to disprove a statement P . We know that to
disprove P , we must prove ∼ P . To prove ∼ P with contradiction, we assume
∼∼ P is true and deduce a contradiction. But since ∼∼ P = P , this boils down
to assuming P is true and deducing a contradiction. Here is an outline:
How to disprove P with contradiction:
Assume P is true, and deduce a contradiction.
To illustrate this, let’s revisit Example 9.3 but do the disproof with
contradiction. You will notice that the work duplicates much of what we
did in Example 9.3, but is it much more streamlined because here we do
not have to negate the conjecture.
Example 9.5 Disprove the following conjecture.
Conjecture There is a real number x for which x4 < x < x2 .
Disproof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that this conjecture is true.
Let x be a real number for which x4 < x < x2 . Then x is positive, since it is
greater than the non-negative number x4 . Dividing all parts of x4 < x < x2
by the positive number x produces x3 < 1 < x. Now subtract 1 from all parts
of x3 < 1 < x to obtain x3 − 1 < 0 < x − 1 and reason as follows:
x3 − 1 < 0 <

x−1

2

(x − 1)(x + x + 1) < 0 < (x − 1)
x2 + x + 1 < 0 < 1

Now we have x2 + x + 1 < 0, which is a contradiction because x is positive.
Thus the conjecture must be false.

Note that in the first five lines of the table, the sum of the first n odd
numbers really does add up to n2 . Notice also that these first five lines
indicate that the nth odd natural number (the last number in each sum)
is 2n − 1. (For instance, when n = 2, the second odd natural number is
2 · 2 − 1 = 3; when n = 3, the third odd natural number is 2 · 3 − 1 = 5, etc.)
The table raises a question. Does the sum 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2n − 1) really
always equal n2 ? In other words, is the conjecture true?
Let’s rephrase this. For each natural number n (i.e., for each line of the
table), we have a statement S n , as follows:

181
S 1 : 1 = 12
S 2 : 1 + 3 = 22
S 3 : 1 + 3 + 5 = 32
..
.

S n : 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2n − 1) = n2
..
.

Our question is: Are all of these statements true?
Mathematical induction answers just this kind of question, where we
have an infinite list of statements S1 , S2 , S3 , . . . that we want to prove true.
The method is really quite simple. To visualize it, think of the statements
as dominoes, lined up in a row. Suppose you can prove the first statement
S 1 , and symbolize this as domino S 1 being knocked down. Also, say you can
prove that any statement S k being true (falling) forces the next statement
S k+1 to be true (to fall). Then S 1 falls, knocking down S 2 . Next S 2 falls,
knocking down S3 , then S3 knocks down S4 , and so on. The inescapable
conclusion is that all the statements are knocked down (proved true).

10.1 Proof by Induction

This domino analogy motivates an outline for our next major proof technique:
proof by mathematical induction.
Outline for Proof by Induction
Proposition The statements S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , . . . are all true.
Proof. (Induction)
(1) Prove that the first statement S1 is true.
(2) Given any integer k ≥ 1, prove that the statement S k ⇒ S k+1 is true.
It follows by mathematical induction that every S n is true.
■
In this setup, the first step (1) is called the basis step. Because S1 is
usually a very simple statement, the basis step is often quite easy to do. The
second step (2) is called the inductive step. In the inductive step direct
proof is most often used to prove S k ⇒ S k+1 , so this step is usually carried
out by assuming S k is true and showing this forces S k+1 to be true. The
assumption that S k is true is called the inductive hypothesis.
Now let’s apply this technique to our original conjecture that the sum of
the first n odd natural numbers equals n2 . Our goal is to show that for each
n ∈ N, the statement S n : 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2n − 1) = n2 is true. Before getting
started, observe that S k is obtained from S n by plugging k in for n. Thus
S k is the statement S k : 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2k − 1) = k2 . Also, we get S k+1 by
plugging in k + 1 for n, so that S k+1 : 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2(k + 1) − 1) = (k + 1)2 .
Proposition If n ∈ N, then 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2n − 1) = n2 .
Proof. We will prove this with mathematical induction.
(1) Observe that if n = 1, this statement is 1 = 12 , which is obviously true.
(2) We must now prove S k ⇒ S k+1 for any k ≥ 1. That is, we must show that
if 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 +· · ·+ (2k − 1) = k2 , then 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 +· · ·+ (2(k + 1) − 1) = (k + 1)2 .
We use direct proof. Suppose 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2k − 1) = k2 . Then
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · + (2(k + 1) − 1) =
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2k − 1) + (2(k + 1) − 1) =
¡
¢
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2k − 1) + (2(k + 1) − 1) =
k2 + (2(k + 1) − 1) =

k2 + 2k + 1

= (k + 1)2 .

Thus 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2(k + 1) − 1) = (k + 1)2 . This proves that S k ⇒ S k+1 .
It follows by induction that 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + · · · + (2n − 1) = n2 for every n ∈ N. ■

In induction proofs it is usually the case that the first statement S1 is
indexed by the natural number 1, but this need not always be so. Depending
on the problem, the first statement could be S0 , or S m for any other integer m.
In the next example S0 , S1 , S2 , S3 , . . . are the statements. The same outline
is used, except that the basis step verifies S0 , not S1 .
Proposition

If n is a non-negative integer, then 5 | (n5 − n).

Proof. We will prove this with mathematical induction. Observe that the
first non-negative integer is 0, so the basis step involves n = 0.
(1) If n = 0, this statement is 5 | (05 − 0) or 5 | 0, which is obviously true.
(2) Let k ≥ 0. We need to prove that if 5 | (k5 − k), then 5 | ((k + 1)5 − (k + 1)).
We use direct proof. Suppose 5 | (k5 − k). Thus k5 − k = 5a for some a ∈ Z.
Observe that
(k + 1)5 − (k + 1) =

k5 + 5k4 + 10k3 + 10k2 + 5k + 1 − k − 1

= (k5 − k) + 5k4 + 10k3 + 10k2 + 5k
= 5a + 5k4 + 10k3 + 10k2 + 5k
¡
¢
= 5 a + k4 + 2k3 + 2k2 + k .

This shows (k +1)5 −(k +1) is an integer multiple of 5, so 5 | ((k +1)5 −(k +1)).
We have now shown that 5 | (k5 − k) implies 5 | ((k + 1)5 − (k + 1)).
It follows by induction that 5 | (n5 − n) for all non-negative integers n.

■

As noted, induction is used to prove statements of the form ∀ n ∈ N, S n .
But notice the outline does not work for statements of form ∀ n ∈ Z, S n (where
n is in Z, not N). The reason is that if you are trying to prove ∀ n ∈ Z, S n by
induction, and you’ve shown S1 is true and S k ⇒ S k+1 , then it only follows
from this that S n is true for n ≥ 1. You haven’t proved that any of the
statements S0 , S−1 , S−2 , . . . are true. If you ever want to prove ∀ n ∈ Z, S n
by induction, you have to show that some S a is true and S k ⇒ S k+1 and
S k ⇒ S k−1 .
Unfortunately, the term mathematical induction is sometimes confused
with inductive reasoning, which is the process of reaching the conclusion
that something is likely to be true based on prior observations of similar
circumstances. Please note that mathematical induction—as introduced in
this chapter—is a rigorous technique that proves statements with absolute
certainty.
To round out this section, we present four additional induction proofs.

In our outline for proof by induction, the inductive step (2) involved
proving S k ⇒ S k+1 . Obviously, you can prove S n ⇒ S n+1 instead. (That
is, assume the statement is true for n, and show that it is true for n + 1.)
Sometimes proving S n−1 ⇒ S n is more convenient, and this too is valid.
The proofs in the following examples will use the scheme S k ⇒ S k+1 , but
some solutions to odd-numbered exercises will be phrased as S n ⇒ S n+1 or
S n−1 ⇒ S n . Fluency comes with reading and practice.

The next example illustrates a trick that is occasionally useful. You
know that you can add equal quantities to both sides of an equation without
violating equality. But don’t forget that you can add unequal quantities to
both sides of an inequality, as long as the quantity added to the bigger side
is bigger than the quantity added to the smaller side. For example, if x ≤ y
and a ≤ b, then x + a ≤ y + b. Similarly, if x ≤ y and b is positive, then x ≤ y + b.
This oft-neglected fact is used in the next proof.
Proposition

The inequality 2n ≤ 2n+1 − 2n−1 − 1 holds for each n ∈ N.

Proof. We will prove this with mathematical induction.
(1) If n = 1, this statement is 21 ≤ 21+1 − 21−1 − 1, and this simplifies to
2 ≤ 4 − 1 − 1, which is obviously true.
(2) Say k ≥ 1. We use direct proof to show that 2k ≤ 2k+1 − 2k−1 − 1 implies
2k+1 ≤ 2(k+1)+1 − 2(k+1)−1 − 1. Suppose 2k ≤ 2k+1 − 2k−1 − 1. Then
2k ≤ 2k+1 − 2k−1 − 1
¡ ¢
¡
¢
2 2k ≤ 2 2k+1 − 2k−1 − 1

(multiply both sides by 2)

2k+1 ≤ 2k+2 − 2k − 2
2k+1 ≤ 2k+2 − 2k − 2 + 1

(add 1 to the bigger side)

2k+1 ≤ 2k+2 − 2k − 1
2k+1 ≤ 2(k+1)+1 − 2(k+1)−1 − 1.

It follows by induction that 2n ≤ 2n+1 − 2n−1 − 1 for each n ∈ N.

■

We next prove that if n ∈ N, then the inequality (1 + x)n ≥ 1 + nx holds for
all x ∈ R with x > −1. Thus we will need to prove that the statement
S n : (1 + x)n ≥ 1 + nx for every x ∈ R with x > −1

is true for every natural number n. This is (only) slightly different from our
other examples, which proved statements of the form ∀n ∈ N, P(n), where
P(n) is a statement about the number n. This time we are proving something
of the form
³
´
∀ n ∈ N, ∀ x ∈ (−1, ∞), P(n, x) ,

where the open sentence P(n, x) : (1 + x)n ≥ 1 + nx involves not only n, but also
a second variable x. (For the record, the inequality (1 + x)n ≥ 1 + nx is known
as Bernoulli’s inequality.)

Proposition

If n ∈ N, then (1 + x)n ≥ 1 + nx for all x ∈ R with x > −1.

Proof. We will prove this with mathematical induction.
(1) For the basis step, notice that when n = 1 the statement is (1 + x)1 ≥
1 + 1 · x , and this is true because both sides equal 1 + x.
(2) Assume that for some k ≥ 1, the statement (1 + x)k ≥ 1 + kx is true for
all x ∈ R with x > −1. From this we need to prove (1 + x)k+1 ≥ 1 + (k + 1)x.
Now, 1 + x is positive because x > −1, so we can multiply both sides of
(1 + x)k ≥ 1 + kx by (1 + x) without changing the direction of the ≥.
(1 + x)k (1 + x) ≥ (1 + kx)(1 + x)
(1 + x)k+1

≥ 1 + x + kx + kx2

(1 + x)k+1

≥ 1 + (k + 1)x + kx2

The above term kx2 is positive, so removing it from the right-hand side
will only make that side smaller. Thus we get (1 + x)k+1 ≥ 1 + (k + 1)x. ■
Next, an example where the basis step involves more than routine checking. (It will be used later, so it is numbered for reference.)
Proposition 10.1 Suppose a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n are n integers, where n ≥ 2. If p
is prime and p | (a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · · · a n ), then p | a i for at least one of the a i .
Proof. The proof is induction on n.
(1) The basis step involves n = 2. Let p be prime and suppose p | (a 1 a 2 ). We
need to show that p | a 1 or p | a 2 , or equivalently, if p - a 1 , then p | a 2 .
Thus suppose p - a 1 . Since p is prime, it follows that gcd(p, a 1 ) = 1. By
Proposition 7.1 (on page 152), there are integers k and ` for which
1 = pk + a 1 `. Multiplying this by a 2 gives
a 2 = pka 2 + a 1 a 2 `.

As we are assuming that p divides a 1 a 2 , it is clear that p divides the
expression pka2 + a 1 a 2 ` on the right; hence p | a 2 . We’ve now proved
that if p | (a 1 a 2 ), then p | a 1 or p | a 2 . This completes the basis step.
(2) Suppose that k ≥ 2, and p | (a 1 · a 2 · · · a k ) implies then p | a i for some a i .
¡
¢
Now let p | (a 1 · a 2 · · · a k · a k+1 ). Then p | (a 1 · a 2 · · · a k ) · a k+1 . By what we
proved in the basis step, it follows that p | (a 1 · a 2 · · · a k ) or p | a k+1 . This
and the inductive hypothesis imply that p divides one of the a i .

Please test your understanding now by working a few exercises.

10.2 Proof by Strong Induction
Sometimes in an induction proof it is hard to show that S k implies S k+1 .
It may be easier to show some “lower” S m (with m < k) implies S k+1 .
For such situations there is a slight variant of induction called strong
induction. Strong induction works just like regular induction, except that
in Step (2) instead of assuming S k is true and showing this forces S k+1 to
be true, we assume that all the statements S1 , S2 , . . . , S k are true and show
this forces S k+1 to be true. The idea is that if the first k dominoes falling
always forces the (k + 1)th domino to fall, then all the dominoes must fall.
Outline for Proof by Strong Induction
Proposition The statements S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , . . . are all true.
Proof. (Strong induction)
(1) Prove the first statement S1 . (Or the first several S n , if needed.)
(2) Given any integer k ≥ 1, prove (S1 ∧ S2 ∧ S3 ∧ · · · ∧ S k ) ⇒ S k+1 .
■
This is useful when S k does not easily imply S k+1 . You may be better served
by showing some earlier statement (S k−1 or S k−2 , for instance) implies S k+1 .
In strong induction you can use any (or all) of S1 , S2 , . . . , S k to prove S k+1 .
Here is a classic first example of a strong induction proof: The problem
is to prove that you can achieve any postage of 8 cents or more, exactly,
using only 3¢ and 5¢ stamps. For example, for a postage of 47 cents, you
could use nine 3¢ stamps and four 5¢ stamps. Let S n be the statement
S n : You can get a postage of exactly n¢ using only 3¢ and 5¢ stamps. Thus
we need to prove all the statements S8 , S9 , S10 , S11 . . . are true. In the proof,
to show S k+1 is true we will need to “go back” three steps from S k+1 , so the
basis step involves verifying the first three statements S8 , S9 and S10 .
Proposition

Any postage of 8¢ or more is possible using 3¢ and 5¢ stamps.

Proof. We will use strong induction.
(1) This holds for postages of 8, 9 and 10 cents: For 8¢, use one 3¢ stamp
and one 5¢ stamp. For 9¢, three 3¢ stamps. For 10¢, two 5¢ stamps.
(2) Let k ≥ 10, and for each 8 ≤ m ≤ k, assume a postage of m cents can be
obtained exactly with 3¢ and 5¢ stamps. (That is, assume statements
S 8 , S 9 , . . . , S k are all true.) We must show that S k+1 is true, that is, (k + 1)cents postage can be achieved with 3¢ and 5¢ stamps. By assumption,
S k−2 is true. Thus we can get (k −2)-cents postage with 3¢ and 5¢ stamps.
Now just add one more 3¢ stamp, and we have (k − 2) + 3 = k + 1 cents
postage with 3¢ and 5¢ stamps.

Our next example proves that 12 | (n4 − n2 ) for any n ∈ N. But first, let’s see
how regular induction is problematic. Regular induction starts by checking
12 | (n4 − n2 ) for n = 1. This reduces to 12 | 0, which is true. Next we assume
¡
¢
12 | (k4 − k2 ) and try to show that this implies 12 | (k + 1)4 − (k + 1)2 . Now,
12 | (k4 − k2 ) means k4 − k2 = 12a for some a ∈ Z. We want to use this to get
(k + 1)4 − (k + 1)2 = 12b for some integer b. Working it out,
(k + 1)4 − (k + 1)2

= (k4 + 4k3 + 6k2 + 4k + 1) − (k2 + 2k + 1)
= (k4 − k2 ) + 4k3 + 6k2 + 2k
= 12a + 4k3 + 6k2 + 2k.

At this point we’re stuck because we can’t factor out a 12.
Let’s try strong induction. Say S n is the statement S n : 12 | (n4 − n2 ).
In strong induction, we assume each of S1 , S2 , . . . , S k is true, and show that
this makes S k+1 true. In particular, if S1 through S k are true, then S k−5 is
true, provided k − 5 ≥ 1. We will show S k−5 ⇒ S k+1 instead of S k ⇒ S k+1 .
But as k − 5 ≥ 1, we have k ≥ 6. Thus our basis step must check that
S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , S 4 , S 5 , S 6 are all true. Once this is done, S k−5 ⇒ S k+1 will imply
that any other S k is true. For example, if k = 6, then S k−5 ⇒ S k+1 is S1 ⇒ S7 ,
so S7 is true. If k = 7, then S k−5 ⇒ S k+1 is S2 ⇒ S8 , so S8 is true, etc.
Proposition

If n ∈ N, then 12 | (n4 − n2 ).

Proof. We will prove this with strong induction.
(1) First note that the statement is true for the first six positive integers:
For n = 1, 12 divides 14 − 12 = 0.
For n = 4, 12 divides 44 − 42 = 240.
For n = 2, 12 divides 24 − 22 = 12. For n = 5, 12 divides 54 − 52 = 600.
For n = 3, 12 divides 34 − 32 = 72. For n = 6, 12 divides 64 − 62 = 1260.
(2) For k ≥ 6, assume 12 | (m4 − m2 ) for 1 ≤ m ≤ k (i.e., S1 , S2 , . . . , S k are true).
¡
¢
We must show S k+1 is true, that is, 12 | (k + 1)4 − (k + 1)2 . Now, S k−5

being true means 12 | (k − 5)4 − (k − 5)2 . To simplify, put k − 5 = ` so
12 | (`4 − `2 ), meaning `4 − `2 = 12a for a ∈ Z, and k + 1 = ` + 6 . Then:
(k + 1)4 − (k + 1)2

= `4 + 24`3 + 216`2 + 864` + 1296 − (`2 + 12` + 36)

= 12 a + 2`3 + 18`2 + 71` + 105 .

Because a + 2`3 + 18`2 + 71` + 105 ∈ Z, we get 12 | (k + 1)4 − (k + 1)2 .

Our next example involves mathematical objects called graphs. The
word graph has two meanings in mathematics. First, there are the graphs
of equations and functions from algebra and calculus. But here we will be
interested in the second meaning: A graph is a configuration consisting of
points (called vertices) and edges, which are lines connecting the vertices.
Following are pictures of four graphs. Let’s agree that all of our graphs will
be in “one piece,” that is, you can travel from any vertex of a graph to any
other vertex by traversing a route of edges from one vertex to the other.
v0

Figure 10.1. Examples of Graphs
A cycle in a graph is a sequence of distinct edges in the graph that form
a route that ends where it began. For example, the graph on the far left
of Figure 10.1 has a cycle that starts at vertex v1 , then goes to v2 , then to
v3 , then v4 and finally back to its starting point v1 . You can find cycles in
both of the graphs on the left, but the two graphs on the right do not have
cycles. There is a special name for a graph that has no cycles; it is called a
tree. Thus the two graphs on the right of Figure 10.1 are trees, but the two
graphs on the left are not trees. Note that a single vertex • has no cycle, so
it is a tree (with one vertex and zero edges).
The two trees in Figure 10.1 both have one fewer edge than vertex. The
tree on the far right has 5 vertices and 4 edges. The one next to it has 6
vertices and 5 edges. Draw any tree (like the one in Figure 10.2). If it has n
vertices, then it will have n − 1 edges. We now prove that this is always true.

Figure 10.2. A tree
Our proof will use the following observation: If we remove an edge from
a tree (but leave its two endpoints), then the tree is cut into two separate
graphs, each a tree, and each smaller than the tree we began with.

Proposition

If a tree has n vertices, then it has n − 1 edges.

Proof. Notice that this theorem asserts that for any n ∈ N, the following
statement is true: S n : A tree with n vertices has n − 1 edges. We use strong
induction to prove this.
(1) Observe that if a tree has n = 1 vertex then it has no edges. Thus it has
n − 1 = 0 edges, so the theorem is true when n = 1. (That is, S 1 is true.)
(2) Now take an integer k ≥ 1. We must show (S1 ∧ S2 ∧ · · · ∧ S k ) ⇒ S k+1 . In
words, we must show that if it is true that any tree with m vertices
has m − 1 edges, where 1 ≤ m ≤ k, then any tree with k + 1 vertices has
(k + 1) − 1 = k edges. We will use direct proof.
Suppose that for each m with 1 ≤ m ≤ k, any tree with m vertices has
m − 1 edges. Let T be a tree with k + 1 vertices. We must show that T
has (k + 1) − 1 edges. Pick an edge of T and label it e, as shown below.

leaves two smaller trees that we call T1 and T2 . Let’s say T1 has x
vertices and T2 has y vertices. As each of these two smaller trees has
fewer than k + 1 vertices, our inductive hypothesis guarantees that T1
has x − 1 edges, and T2 has y − 1 edges. Think about our original tree T .
It has x + y vertices. It has x − 1 edges that belong to T1 and y − 1 edges
that belong to T2 , plus it has the additional edge e that belongs to
neither T1 nor T2 . Thus, all together, the number of edges that T has
is (x − 1) + (y − 1) + 1 = (x + y) − 1. In other words, T has one fewer edges
than it has vertices. Thus T has k + 1 vertices and (k + 1) − 1 = k edges.
It follows by strong induction that a tree with n vertices has n − 1 edges. ■
Notice that it was absolutely essential that we used strong induction
in the above proof because the two trees T1 and T2 will not both have k
vertices. At least one will have fewer than k vertices. Thus the statement
S k is not enough to imply S k+1 . We need to use the assumption that S m will
be true whenever m ≤ k, and strong induction allows us to do this.

10.3 Proof by Smallest Counterexample
This section introduces yet another proof technique, called proof by smallest counterexample. It is a hybrid of induction and proof by contradiction.
It has the nice feature that it leads you straight to a contradiction. It is therefore more “automatic” than the proof by contradiction that was introduced
in Chapter 6. Here is the outline:
Outline for Proof by Smallest Counterexample
Proposition

The statements S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , . . . are all true.

Proof. (Smallest counterexample)
(1) Check that the first statement S1 is true.
(2) For the sake of contradiction, suppose not every S n is true.
(3) Let k > 1 be the smallest integer for which S k is false.
(4) Then S k−1 is true and S k is false. Use this to get a contradiction.

■

This setup leads you to a point where S k−1 is true and S k is false. It is
here, where true and false collide, that you will find a contradiction. Let’s
do an example.
Proposition

If n ∈ N, then 4 | (5n − 1).

Proof. We use proof by smallest counterexample. (We will number the steps
to match the outline, but that is not usually done in practice.)
(1) If n = 1, then the statement is 4 | (51 − 1), or 4 | 4, which is true.
(2) For sake of contradiction, suppose it’s not true that 4 | (5n − 1) for all n.
(3) Let k > 1 be the smallest integer for which 4 - (5k − 1).
(4) Then 4 | (5k−1 − 1), so there is an integer a for which 5k−1 − 1 = 4a. Then
5k−1 − 1 = 4a
5(5k−1 − 1) = 5 · 4a
5k − 5 = 20a
5k − 1 = 20a + 4
5k − 1 = 4(5a + 1).

This means 4 | (5k −1), a contradiction, because 4 - (5k −1) in Step 3. Thus,
we were wrong in Step 2 to assume that it is untrue that 4 | (5n − 1) for
every n. Therefore 4 | (5n − 1) is true for every n.

10.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any integer greater
than 1 has a unique prime factorization. For example, 12 factors into primes
as 12 = 2 · 2 · 3, and moreover any factorization of 12 into primes uses exactly
the primes 2, 2 and 3. Our proof combines the techniques of induction,
cases, minimum counterexample and the idea of uniqueness of existence
outlined at the end of Section 7.3.
Theorem 10.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) Any integer n > 1
has a unique prime factorization. “Unique” means that if n = p 1 · p 2 · p 3 · · · p k
and n = a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · · · a ` are two prime factorizations of n, then k = `, and the
primes p i and a i are the same, except that they may be in different orders.
Proof. Suppose n > 1. We first use strong induction to show that n has a
prime factorization. For the basis step, if n = 2, it is prime, so it is already
its own prime factorization. Let n ≥ 2 and assume every integer between 2
and n (inclusive) has a prime factorization. Consider n + 1. If it is prime,
then it is its own prime factorization. If it is not prime, then it factors as
n + 1 = ab with a, b > 1. Because a and b are both less than n + 1 they have
prime factorizations a = p 1 · p 2 · p 3 · · · p k and b = p01 · p02 · p03 · · · p0` . Then
n + 1 = ab = (p 1 · p 2 · p 3 · · · p k )(p01 · p02 · p03 · · · p0` )

is a prime factorization of n + 1. This competes the proof by strong induction
that every integer greater than 1 has a prime factorization.
Next we use proof by smallest counterexample to prove that the prime
factorization of any n ≥ 2 is unique. If n = 2, then n clearly has only one
prime factorization, namely itself. Assume for the sake of contradiction that
there is an n > 2 that has different prime factorizations n = p 1 · p 2 · p 3 · · · p k
and n = a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · · · a ` . Assume n is the smallest number with this property.
From n = p 1 · p 2 · p 3 · · · p k , we see that p 1 | n, so p 1 | (a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · · · a ` ). By
Proposition 10.1 (page 186), p 1 divides one of the primes a i . As a i is prime,
we have p 1 = a i . Dividing n = p 1 · p 2 · p 3 · · · p k = a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · · · a ` by p 1 = a i
yields
p 2 · p 3 · · · p k = a 1 · a 2 · a 3 · · · a i−1 · a i+1 · · · a ` .

These two factorizations are different, because the two prime factorizations
of n were different. (Remember: the primes p 1 and a i are equal, so the
difference appears in the remaining factors, displayed above.) But also the
above number p 2 · p 3 · · · p k is smaller than n, and this contradicts the fact
that n was the smallest number with two different prime factorizations. ■

A word of caution about induction and proof by smallest counterexample:
In proofs in other textbooks or in mathematical papers, it often happens
that the writer doesn’t tell you up front that these techniques are being
used. Instead, you will have to read through the proof to glean from context
what technique is being used. In fact, the same warning applies to all of our
proof techniques. If you continue with mathematics, you will gradually gain
through experience the ability to analyze a proof and understand exactly
what approach is being used when it is not stated explicitly. Frustrations
await you, but do not be discouraged by them. Frustration is a natural part
of anything that’s worth doing.
10.5 Fibonacci Numbers
Leonardo Pisano, now known as Fibonacci, was a mathematician born
around 1175 in what is now Italy. His most significant work was a book
Liber Abaci, which is recognized as a catalyst in medieval Europe’s slow
transition from Roman numbers to the Hindu-Arabic number system. But
he is best known today for a number sequence that he described in his book
and that bears his name. The Fibonacci sequence is
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, . . .

The numbers that appear in this sequence are called Fibonacci numbers.
The first two numbers are 1 and 1, and thereafter any entry is the sum
of the previous two entries. For example 3 + 5 = 8, and 5 + 8 = 13, etc. We
denote the nth term of this sequence as F n . Thus F1 = 1, F2 = 1, F3 = 2,
F4 = 3, F7 = 13 and so on. Notice that the Fibonacci sequence is entirely
determined by the rules F1 = 1, F2 = 1, and F n = F n−1 + F n−2 .
We introduce Fibonacci’s sequence here partly because it is something
everyone should know about, but also because it is a great source of induction
problems. This sequence, which appears with surprising frequency in
nature, is filled with mysterious patterns and hidden structures. Some of
these structures will be revealed in the examples and exercises.
We emphasize that the condition F n = F n−1 + F n−2 (or equivalently F n+1 =
F n + F n−1 ) is the perfect setup for induction. It suggests that we can determine something about F n by looking at earlier terms of the sequence.
In using induction to prove something about the Fibonacci sequence, you
should expect to use the equation F n = F n−1 + F n−2 somewhere.
For our first example we will prove that F n2+1 − F n+1 F n − F n2 = (−1)n for any
natural number n. For example, if n = 5 we have F62 − F6 F5 − F52 = 82 − 8 · 5 − 52 =
64 − 40 − 25 = −1 = (−1)5 .

Proposition

The Fibonacci sequence obeys F n2+1 − F n+1 F n − F n2 = (−1)n .

Proof. We will prove this with mathematical induction.
(1) If n = 1 we have F n2+1 − F n+1 F n − F n2 = F22 − F2 F1 − F12 = 12 − 1 · 1 − 12 = −1 =
(−1)1 = (−1)n , so indeed F n2+1 − F n+1 F n − F n2 = (−1)n is true when n = 1.
(2) Let k ∈ N. Using direct proof, we will show F k2+1 − F k+1 F k − F k2 = (−1)k
implies F k2+2 − F k+2 F k+1 − F k2+1 = (−1)k+1 . Say F k2+1 − F k+1 F k − F k2 = (−1)k .
Next we work out F k2+2 − F k+2 F k+1 − F k2+1 and show that it equals (−1)k+1 .
In doing this we will use the fact F k+2 = F k+1 + F k . Observe that
F k2+2 − F k+2 F k+1 − F k2+1

= (F k+1 + F k )2 − (F k+1 + F k )F k+1 − F k2+1
=

F k2+1 + 2F k+1 F k + F k2 − F k2+1 − F k F k+1 − F k2+1

= −F k2+1 + F k+1 F k + F k2
= −(F k2+1 − F k+1 F k − F k2 )
= −(−1)k

(inductive hypothesis)

= (−1)1 (−1)k
= (−1)k+1 .

Therefore F k2+2 − F k+2 F k+1 − F k2+1 = (−1)k+1 .
It follows by induction that F n2+1 − F n+1 F n − F n2 = (−1)n for every n ∈ N.

■

Let’s pause for a moment and think about what the result we just proved
means. Dividing both sides of F n2+1 − F n+1 F n − F n2 = (−1)n by F n2 gives

For large values of n, the right-hand side is very close to zero, and the
left-hand side is F n+1 /F n plugged into the polynomial x2 − x − 1. Thus, as
n increases, the ratio F n+1 /F n approaches a root
of x2 − x − 1 = 0. By the
p
quadratic formula, the roots of x2 − x − 1 are 1±2 5 . As F n+1 /F n > 1, this ratio
must be approaching the positive root

For a quick spot check, note that F14 /F13 ≈ 1.618025, while 1+2 5 ≈ 1.618033.
Even for the small value n = 13, the numbers match to four decimal places.

The number Φ = 1+2 5 is sometimes called the golden ratio, and there
has been much speculation about its occurrence in nature as well as in
classical art and architecture. One theory holds that the Parthenon and the
Great Pyramids of Egypt were designed in accordance with this number.
But we are here concerned with things that can be proved. We close by
observing how the Fibonacci sequence in many ways resembles a geometric
sequence. Recall that a geometric sequence with first term a and common
ratio r has the form
a, ar, ar 2 , ar 3 , ar 4 , ar 5 , ar 6 , ar 7 , ar 8 , . . .

where any term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by r . In
general its nth term is G n = ar n , and G n+1 /G n = r . Equation (10.1) tells
us that F n+1 /F n ≈ Φ. Thus even though it is not a geometric sequence, the
Fibonacci sequence tends to behave like a geometric sequence with common
ratio Φ, and the further “out” you go, the higher the resemblance.

Relations

I

n mathematics there are endless ways that two entities can be related
to each other. Consider the following mathematical statements.

5 < 10
a ≡ b ( mod n)

5≤5
6∈Z

6 = 30
5
X ⊆Y

5 | 80
π ≈ 3.14

7>4
0 ≥ −1

x 6= y
p
2∉Z

8-3
Z 6⊆ N

In each case two entities appear on either side of a symbol, and we
interpret the symbol as expressing some relationship between the two
entities. Symbols such as <, ≤, =, |, -, ≥, >, ∈ and ⊆, etc., are called relations
because they convey relationships among things.
Relations are significant. In fact, you would have to admit that there
would be precious little left of mathematics if we took away all the relations.
Therefore it is important to have a firm understanding of them, and this
chapter is intended to develop that understanding.
Rather than focusing on each relation individually (an impossible task
anyway since there are infinitely many different relations), we will develop
a general theory that encompasses all relations. Understanding this
general theory will give us the conceptual framework and language needed
to understand and discuss any specific relation.
11.1 Relations
Before stating the theoretical definition of a relation, let’s look at a
motivational example. This example will lead naturally to our definition.
©
ª
Consider the set A = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . (There’s nothing special about this
particular set; any set of numbers would do for this example.) Elements
of A can be compared to each other by the symbol “<.” For example, 1 < 4,
2 < 3, 2 < 4, and so on. You have no trouble understanding this because the
notion of numeric order is so ingrained. But imagine you had to explain
it to an idiot savant, one with an obsession for detail but absolutely no
understanding of the meaning of (or relationships between) integers. You
might consider writing down for your student the following set:
©
ª
R = (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5) .

Relations

202

The set R encodes the meaning of the < relation for elements in A . An
ordered pair (a, b) appears in the set if and only if a < b. If asked whether or
not it is true that 3 < 4, your student could look through R until he found
the ordered pair (3, 4); then he would know 3 < 4 is true. If asked about 5 < 2,
he would see that (5, 2) does not appear in R , so 5 6< 2. The set R , which is a
subset of A × A , completely describes the relation < for A .
It may seem simple-minded at first, but this is the central idea of our
main definition. This definition is general enough to describe not just the
©
ª
relation < for the set A = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , but any relation for any set A .
Definition 11.1 A relation on a set A is a subset R ⊆ A × A . We often
abbreviate the statement (x, y) ∈ R as xR y. The statement (x, y) ∉ R is
abbreviated as x R
6 y.
Notice that a relation is a set, so we can use what we know about sets to
understand and explore relations. But before getting deeper into the theory
of relations, let’s look at some examples of Definition 11.1.
©

ª

Example 11.1 Let A = 1, 2, 3, 4 , and consider the following set:
©
ª
R = (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1) ⊆ A × A.

The set R is a relation on A , by Definition 11.1. Since (1, 1) ∈ R , we have
1R1. Similarly 2R1 and 2R2, and so on. However, notice that (for example)
(3, 4) ∉ R , so 3 R
6 4. Observe that R is the familiar relation ≥ for the set A .
Chapter 1 proclaimed that all of mathematics can be described with sets.
Just look at how successful this program has been! The greater-than-orequal-to relation is now a set R . (We might even express this in the rather
cryptic form ≥= R .)
©

ª

Example 11.2 Let A = 1, 2, 3, 4 , and consider the following set:
©
ª
S = (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4) ⊆ A × A.

Here we have 1S1, 1S3, 4S2, etc., but 3 6S 4 and 2 6S 1. What does S mean?
Think of it as meaning “has the same parity as.” Thus 1S1 reads “1 has the
same parity as 1,” and 4S2 reads “4 has the same parity as 2.”
Example 11.3 Consider relations R and S of the previous two examples.
©
ª
Note that R ∩ S = (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 1), (4, 4), (4, 2) ⊆ A × A is a relation on A .
The expression x(R ∩ S)y means “ x ≥ y, and x has the same parity as y.”

Let B = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , and consider the following set:

U = (1, 3), (3, 3), (5, 2), (2, 5), (4, 2) ⊆ B × B.

Then U is a relation on B because U ⊆ B × B. You may be hard-pressed to
invent any “meaning” for this particular relation. A relation does not have
to have any meaning. Any random subset of B × B is a relation on B, whether
or not it describes anything familiar.
Some relations can be described with pictures. For example, we can
depict the above relation U on B by drawing points labeled by elements of B.
The statement (x, y) ∈ U is then represented by an arrow pointing from x to y,
a graphic symbol meaning “x relates to y.” Here is a picture of U :

that the picture conveys the relation better than the set does. They are two
different ways of expressing the same thing. In some instances pictures are
more convenient than sets for discussing relations.

Although such diagrams can help us visualize relations, they do have
their limitations. If A and R were infinite, then the diagram would be
impossible to draw, but the set R might be easily expressed in set-builder
notation. Here are some examples.
Example 11.5 Consider the set R = (x, y) ∈ Z × Z : x − y ∈ N ⊆ Z × Z. This
is the > relation on the set A = Z. It is infinite because there are infinitely
many ways to have x > y where x and y are integers.

Example 11.6 The set R = (x, x) : x ∈ R ⊆ R × R is the relation = on the
set R, because xR y means the same thing as x = y. Thus R is a set that
expresses the notion of equality of real numbers.

11.2 Properties of Relations
A relational expression xR y is an open sentence; it is either true or false.
For example, 5 < 10 is true, and 10 < 5 is false. (Thus an operation like +
is not a relation, because, for instance, 5 + 10 has a numeric value, not a
T/F value.) Since relational expressions have T/F values, we can combine
them with logical operators; for example, xR y ⇒ yRx is a statement or open
sentence whose truth or falsity may depend on x and y.
With this in mind, note that some relations have properties that others
don’t have. For example, the relation ≤ on Z satisfies x ≤ x for every x ∈ Z.
But this is not so for < because x < x is never true. The next definition lays
out three particularly significant properties that relations may have.
Definition 11.2 Suppose R is a relation on a set A .
1. Relation R is reflexive if xRx for every x ∈ A .
That is, R is reflexive if ∀ x ∈ A, xRx.
2. Relation R is symmetric if xR y implies yRx for all x, y ∈ A .
That is, R is symmetric if ∀ x, y ∈ A, xR y ⇒ yRx.
3. Relation R is transitive if whenever xR y and yR z, then also xR z.
¡
¢
That is, R is transitive if ∀ x, y, z ∈ A, (xR y) ∧ (yR z) ⇒ xR z.
To illustrate this, let’s consider the set A = Z. Examples of reflexive
relations on Z include ≤, =, and |, because x ≤ x, x = x and x | x are all true
for any x ∈ Z. On the other hand, >, <, 6= and - are not reflexive, for none of
the statements x < x, x > x, x 6= x and x - x is ever true.
The relation 6= is symmetric, for if x 6= y, then surely y 6= x also. Also,
the relation = is symmetric because x = y always implies y = x.
The relation ≤ is not symmetric, as x ≤ y does not necessarily imply
y ≤ x. For instance 5 ≤ 6 is true, but 6 ≤ 5 is false. Notice (x ≤ y) ⇒ (y ≤ x) is
true for some x and y (for example, it is true when x = 2 and y = 2), but still
≤ is not symmetric because it is not the case that (x ≤ y) ⇒ (y ≤ x) is true
for all integers x and y.
The relation ≤ is transitive because whenever x ≤ y and y ≤ z, it also
is true that x ≤ z. Likewise <, ≥, > and = are all transitive. Examine the
following table and be sure you understand why it is labeled as it is.

Example 11.7 Here A = b, c, d, e , and R is the following relation on A :
©
ª
R = (b, b), (b, c), (c, b), (c, c), (d, d), (b, d), (d, b), (c, d), (d, c) .
This relation is not reflexive, for although bRb, cR c and dRd , it is not true
that eR e. For a relation to be reflexive, xRx must be true for all x ∈ A .
The relation R is symmetric, because whenever we have xR y, it follows
that yRx too. Observe that bR c and cRb; bRd and dRb; dR c and cRd . Take
away the ordered pair (c, b) from R , and R is no longer symmetric.
The relation R is transitive, but it takes some work to check it. We
must check that the statement (xR y ∧ yR z) ⇒ xR z is true for all x, y, z ∈ A .
For example, taking x = b, y = c and z = d , we have (bR c ∧ cRd) ⇒ bRd ,
which is the true statement (T ∧ T) ⇒ T . Likewise, (bRd ∧ dR c) ⇒ bR c is
the true statement (T ∧ T) ⇒ T . Take note that if x = b, y = e and z = c,
then (bR e ∧ eR c) ⇒ bR c becomes (F ∧ F) ⇒ T , which is still true. It’s not
much fun, but going through all the combinations, you can verify that
(xR y ∧ yR z) ⇒ xR z is true for all choices x, y, z ∈ A . (Try at least a few of
them.)
The relation R from Example 11.7 has a meaning. You can think of
xR y as meaning that x and y are both consonants. Thus bR c because b
and c are both consonants; but b R
6 e because it’s not true that b and e are
both consonants. Once we look at it this way, it’s immediately clear that R
has to be transitive. If x and y are both consonants and y and z are both
consonants, then surely x and z are both consonants. This illustrates a
point that we will see again later in this section: Knowing the meaning of a
relation can help us understand it and prove things about it.
Here is a picture of R . Notice that we can immediately spot several
properties of R that may not have been so clear from its set description. For
instance, we see that R is not reflexive because it lacks a loop at e, hence
eR
6 e.

Consider the bottom diagram in Box 3, above. The transitive property
demands (xR y ∧ yRx) ⇒ xRx. Thus, if xR y and yRx in a transitive relation,
then also xRx, so there is a loop at x. In this case (yRx ∧ xR y) ⇒ yR y, so
there will be a loop at y too.
Although these visual aids can be illuminating, their use is limited
because many relations are too large and complex to be adequately described
as diagrams. For example, it would be impossible to draw a diagram for the
relation ≡ (mod n), where n ∈ N. Such a relation would best be explained in
a more theoretical (and less visual) way.
We next prove that ≡ (mod n) is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Obviously we will not glean this from a drawing. Instead we will prove it
from the properties of ≡ (mod n) and Definition 11.2. Pay attention to this
example. It illustrates how to prove things about relations.

Example 11.8 Prove the following proposition.

Proposition Let n ∈ N. The relation ≡ (mod n) on the set Z is reflexive,
symmetric and transitive.
Proof. First we will show that ≡ (mod n) is reflexive. Take any integer x ∈ Z,
and observe that n | 0, so n | (x − x). By definition of congruence modulo n, we
have x ≡ x (mod n). This shows x ≡ x (mod n) for every x ∈ Z, so ≡ (mod n) is
reflexive.
Next, we will show that ≡ (mod n) is symmetric. For this, we must show
that for all x, y ∈ Z, the condition x ≡ y (mod n) implies that y ≡ x (mod n).
We use direct proof. Suppose x ≡ y (mod n). Thus n | (x − y) by definition
of congruence modulo n. Then x − y = na for some a ∈ Z by definition of
divisibility. Multiplying both sides by −1 gives y − x = n(−a). Therefore
n | (y − x), and this means y ≡ x (mod n). We’ve shown that x ≡ y (mod n)
implies that y ≡ x (mod n), and this means ≡ (mod n) is symmetric.
Finally we will show that ≡ (mod n) is transitive. For this we must
show that if x ≡ y (mod n) and y ≡ z (mod n), then x ≡ z (mod n). Again
we use direct proof. Suppose x ≡ y (mod n) and y ≡ z (mod n). This means
n | (x − y) and n | (y − z). Therefore there are integers a and b for which
x − y = na and y − z = nb. Adding these two equations, we obtain x − z = na + nb.
Consequently, x − z = n(a + b), so n | (x − z), hence x ≡ z (mod n). This completes
the proof that ≡ (mod n) is transitive.
The past three paragraphs have shown that the relation ≡ (mod n) is
reflexive, symmetric and transitive, so the proof is complete.
■
As you continue with mathematics the reflexive, symmetric and transitive properties will take on special significance in a variety of settings.
In preparation for this, the next section explores further consequences of
these properties. But first work some of the following exercises.

11.3 Equivalence Relations

The relation = on the set Z (or on any set A ) is reflexive, symmetric and
transitive. There are many other relations that are also reflexive, symmetric
and transitive. Relations that have all three of these properties occur very
frequently in mathematics and often play quite significant roles. (For
instance, this is certainly true of the relation = .) Such relations are given
a special name. They are called equivalence relations.
Definition 11.3 A relation R on a set A is an equivalence relation if
it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
As an example, Figure 11.2 shows four different equivalence relations R1 ,
©
ª
R 2 , R 3 and R 4 on the set A = − 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 . Each one has its own meaning,
as labeled. For example, in the second row the relation R2 literally means
“has the same parity as.” So 1R2 3 means “1 has the same parity as 3,” etc.

Equivalence Relations

211

The above diagrams make it easy to check that each relation is reflexive,
symmetric and transitive, i.e., that each is an equivalence relation. For
example, R1 is symmetric because xR 1 y ⇒ yR 1 x is always true: When x = y
it becomes T ⇒ T (true), and when x 6= y it becomes F ⇒ F (also true). In
a similar fashion, R1 is transitive because (xR 1 y ∧ yR1 z) ⇒ xR 1 z is always
true: It always works out to one of T ⇒ T , F ⇒ T or F ⇒ F . (Check this.)
As you can see from the examples in Figure 11.2, equivalence relations
on a set tend to express some measure of “sameness” among the elements
of the set, whether it is true equality or something weaker (like having the
same parity).
It’s time to introduce an important definition. Whenever you have an
equivalence relation R on a set A , it divides A into subsets called equivalence
classes. Here is the definition:
Definition 11.4 Suppose R is an equivalence relation on a set A . Given
any element a ∈ A , the equivalence class containing a is the subset
©
ª
x ∈ A : xRa of A consisting of all the elements of A that relate to a. This
set is denoted as [a]. Thus the equivalence class containing a is the set
©
ª
[a] = x ∈ A : xRa .
Example 11.9 Consider the relation R1 in Figure 11.2. The equivalence
©
ª
class containing 2 is the set [2] = x ∈ A : xR 1 2 . Because in this relation the
© ª
only element that relates to 2 is 2 itself, we have [2] = 2 . Other equivalence
©
ª
© ª
© ª
© ª
classes for R1 are [−1] = − 1 , [1] = 1 , [3] = 3 and [4] = 4 . Thus this
relation has five separate equivalence classes.
Example 11.10 Consider the relation R2 in Figure 11.2. The equivalence
©
ª
class containing 2 is the set [2] = x ∈ A : xR 2 2 . Because only 2 and 4 relate
©
ª
©
ª ©
ª
to 2, we have [2] = 2, 4 . Observe that we also have [4] = x ∈ A : xR 2 4 = 2, 4 ,
©
ª ©
ª
so [2] = [4]. Another equivalence class for R2 is [1] = x ∈ A : xR 2 1 = − 1, 1, 3 .
©
ª
In addition, note that [1] = [−1] = [3] = − 1, 1, 3 . Thus this relation has just
©
ª
©
ª
two equivalence classes, namely 2, 4 and − 1, 1, 3 .
Example 11.11 The relation R4 in Figure 11.2 has three equivalence
©
ª
©
ª
©
ª
classes. They are [−1] = − 1 and [1] = [3] = 1, 3 and [2] = [4] = 2, 4 .
Don’t be misled by Figure 11.2. It’s important to realize that not every
equivalence relation can be drawn as a diagram involving nodes and arrows.
©
ª
Even the simple relation R = (x, x) : x ∈ R , which expresses equality in the
set R, is too big to be drawn. Its picture would involve a point for every real
number and a loop at each point. Clearly that’s too many points and loops
to draw.

We close this section with several other examples of equivalence relations
on infinite sets.
Example 11.12 Let P be the set of all polynomials with real coefficients.
Define a relation R on P as follows. Given f (x), g(x) ∈ P , let f (x) R g(x) mean
that f (x) and g(x) have the same degree. Thus (x2 + 3x − 4) R (3x2 − 2) and
(x3 + 3x2 − 4) 6R (3x2 − 2), for example. It takes just a quick mental check to
see that R is an equivalence relation. (Do it.) It’s easy to describe the
equivalence classes of R . For example, [3x2 + 2] is the set of all polynomials
that have the same degree as 3x2 + 2, that is, the set of all polynomials of
©
ª
degree 2. We can write this as [3x2 + 2] = ax2 + bx + c : a, b, c ∈ R, a 6= 0 .
Example 11.13 In Example 11.8 we proved that for a given n ∈ N the
relation ≡ (mod n) is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Thus, in our new
parlance, ≡ (mod n) is an equivalence relation on Z. Consider the case n = 3.
Let’s find the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation ≡ (mod 3).
The equivalence class containing 0 seems like a reasonable place to start.
Observe that
©
ª
[0] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 0 (mod 3) =
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
x ∈ Z : 3 | (x − 0) = x ∈ Z : 3 | x = . . . , −3, 0, 3, 6, 9, . . . .

Thus the class [0] consists of all the multiples of 3. (Or, said differently, [0]
consists of all integers that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 3.) Note
that [0] = [3] = [6] = [9], etc. The number 1 does not show up in the set [0] so
let’s next look at the equivalence class [1]:
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
[1] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 1 (mod 3) = x ∈ Z : 3 | (x − 1) = . . . , −5, −2, 1, 4, 7, 10, . . . .

The equivalence class [1] consists of all integers that give a remainder of 1
when divided by 3. The number 2 is in neither of the sets [0] or [1], so we
next look at the equivalence class [2]:
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
[2] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 2 (mod 3) = x ∈ Z : 3 | (x − 2) = . . . , −4, −1, 2, 5, 8, 11, . . . .

The equivalence class [2] consists of all integers that give a remainder of
2 when divided by 3. Observe that any integer is in one of the sets [0], [1]
or [2], so we have listed all of the equivalence classes. Thus ≡ (mod 3) has
exactly three equivalence classes, as described above.
Similarly, you can show that the equivalence relation ≡ (mod n) has n
equivalence classes [0], [1], [2], . . . , [n − 1].

Equivalence Relations

The idea of an equivalence relation is fundamental. In a very real sense
you have dealt with equivalence relations for much of your life, without
being aware of it. In fact your conception of fractions is entwined with an
intuitive notion of an equivalence relation. To see how this is so, consider
the set of all fractions, not necessarily reduced:
F=

nm

n

o
: m, n ∈ Z, n 6= 0 .

Interpret this set not as Q, but rather as the set of all possible fractions.
For example, we consider the fractions 21 and 24 as being distinct (unequal)
elements of F because their numerators and denominators don’t match.
Of course 12 and 24 are equal numbers, but they are different fractions, so

The takeaway is that you have for years lumped together equal fractions
into equivalence classes under this equivalence relation.
Later, when you learned calculus, equivalence relations once again were
R
just under the surface. The antiderivative f (x) dx of a function f (x) was
defined to be the set of functions F(x) + C whose derivatives are f (x). This
set is an equivalence class in the set of integrable functions, where two
functions are related if their difference is a constant. (We are glossing over
some fine points that will be cleared up in an advanced calculus course.)
Such examples underscore an important point: Equivalence relations
arise in many areas of mathematics. This is especially true in the advanced
realms of mathematics, where equivalence relations are the right tool
for important constructions, constructions as natural and far-reaching as
fractions, or antiderivatives. Learning about equivalence relations now
paves the way to a deeper understanding of later courses, and work.

11.4 Equivalence Classes and Partitions
This section collects several properties of equivalence classes.
Our first result proves that [a] = [b] if and only if aRb. This is useful
because it assures us that whenever we are in a situation where [a] = [b], we
also have aRb, and vice versa. Being able to switch back and forth between
these two pieces of information can be helpful in a variety of situations,
and you may find yourself using this result a lot. Be sure to notice that
the proof uses all three properties (reflexive, symmetric and transitive) of
equivalence relations. Notice also that we have to use some techniques from
Chapter 8 (Proofs Involving Sets) in dealing with the sets [a] and [b].
Theorem 11.1 Suppose R is an equivalence relation on a set A . Suppose
also that a, b ∈ A . Then [a] = [b] if and only if aRb.
Proof. Suppose [a] = [b]. Note that aRa by the reflexive property of R , so
©
ª
©
ª
©
ª
a ∈ x ∈ A : xRa = [a] = [b] = x ∈ A : xRb . But a belonging to x ∈ A : xRb
means aRb. This completes the first part of the if-and-only-if proof.
Conversely, suppose aRb. We need to show [a] = [b]. We will do this by
showing [a] ⊆ [b] and [b] ⊆ [a].
©
ª
First we show [a] ⊆ [b]. Suppose c ∈ [a]. As c ∈ [a] = x ∈ A : xRa , we get
cRa. Now we have cRa and aRb, so cRb because R is transitive. But cRb
©
ª
implies c ∈ x ∈ A : xRb = [b]. This demonstrates that c ∈ [a] implies c ∈ [b],
so [a] ⊆ [b].
©
ª
Next we show [b] ⊆ [a]. Suppose c ∈ [b]. As c ∈ [b] = x ∈ A : xRb , we get
cRb. Remember that we are assuming aRb, so bRa because R is symmetric.
Now we have cRb and bRa, so cRa because R is transitive. But cRa implies
©
ª
c ∈ x ∈ A : xRa = [a]. This demonstrates that c ∈ [b] implies c ∈ [a]; hence
[b] ⊆ [a].
The previous two paragraphs imply that [a] = [b].
■
To illustrate Theorem 11.1, recall that in Example 11.13 we worked out
the equivalence classes of ≡ (mod 3). We observed that
©
ª
[−3] = [9] = . . . , −3, 0, 3, 6, 9, . . . .

Note that [−3] = [9] and −3 ≡ 9 (mod 3), just as Theorem 11.1 predicts. The
theorem assures us that this will work for any equivalence relation. In
the future you may find yourself using the result of Theorem 11.1 often.
Over time it may become natural and familiar; you will use it automatically,
without even thinking of it as a theorem.

Our next topic addresses the fact that an equivalence relation on a set
A divides A into various equivalence classes. There is a special word for

this kind of situation. We address it now, as you are likely to encounter it
in subsequent mathematics classes.
Definition 11.5 A partition of a set A is a set of non-empty subsets
of A , such that the union of all the subsets equals A , and the intersection
of any two different subsets is ;.

ª © ª © ªª

Example 11.14 Let A = a, b, c, d . One partition of A is a, b , c , d .
©
ª © ª

This is a set of three subsets a, b , c and d of A . The union of the three
subsets equals A ; the intersection of any two subsets is ;.
Other partitions of A are

to name a few. Intuitively, a partition is just a dividing up of A into pieces.
Example 11.15 Consider the equivalence relations in Figure 11.2. Each
©
ª
of these is a relation on the set A = − 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 . The equivalence classes of
each relation are listed on the right side of the figure. Observe that, in each
case, the set of equivalence classes forms a partition of A . For example, the
©©
ª © ª © ª © ª © ªª
relation R1 yields the partition − 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 of A . Likewise the
©©
ª©
ªª
equivalence classes of R2 form the partition − 1, 1, 3 , 2, 4 .
Example 11.16 Recall that Example 11.13 worked out the equivalence
classes of the equivalence relation ≡ (mod 3) on the set Z. These equivalence
classes give the following partition of Z:

ª

We can write it more compactly as [0], [1], [2] .
Our examples and experience suggest that the equivalence classes of an
equivalence relation on a set form a partition of that set. This is indeed the
case, and we now prove it.
Theorem 11.2 Suppose R is an equivalence relation on a set A . Then the
©
ª
set [a] : a ∈ A of equivalence classes of R forms a partition of A .
Proof. To show that [a] : a ∈ A is a partition of A we need to show two
things: We need to show that the union of all the sets [a] equals A , and we
need to show that if [a] 6= [b], then [a] ∩ [b] = ;.

Notationally, the union of all the sets [a] is a∈ A [a], so we need to prove
S
a∈ A [a] = A . Suppose x ∈ a∈ A [a]. This means x ∈ [a] for some a ∈ A . Since
S
[a] ⊆ A , it then follows that x ∈ A . Thus a∈ A [a] ⊆ A . On the other hand,
suppose x ∈ A . As x ∈ [x], we know x ∈ [a] for some a ∈ A (namely a = x).
S

Therefore x ∈ a∈ A [a], and this shows A ⊆ a∈ A [a]. Since a∈ A [a] ⊆ A and
S
S
A ⊆ a∈ A [a], it follows that a∈ A [a] = A .
Next we need to show that if [a] 6= [b] then [a] ∩ [b] = ;. Let’s use contrapositive proof. Suppose it’s not the case that [a] ∩ [b] = ;, so there is
some element c with c ∈ [a] ∩ [b]. Thus c ∈ [a] and c ∈ [b]. Now, c ∈ [a] means
cRa, and then aR c since R is symmetric. Also c ∈ [b] means cRb. Now we
have aR c and cRb, so aRb (because R is transitive). By Theorem 11.1, aRb
implies [a] = [b]. Thus [a] 6= [b] is not true.
We’ve now shown that the union of all the equivalence classes is A , and
the intersection of two different equivalence classes is ;. Therefore the set
of equivalence classes is a partition of A .
■
S

Theorem 11.2 says the equivalence classes of any equivalence relation
on a set A form a partition of A . Conversely, any partition of A describes
an equivalence relation R where xR y if and only if x and y belong to the
same set in the partition. (See Exercise 4 for this section, below.) Thus
equivalence relations and partitions are really just two different ways of
looking at the same thing. In your future mathematical studies you may
find yourself easily switching between these two points of view.

11.5 The Integers Modulo n

Example 11.8 proved that for any given n ∈ N, the relation ≡ (mod n) is
reflexive, symmetric and transitive, so it is an equivalence relation. This is
a particularly significant equivalence relation in mathematics, and in the
present section we deduce some of its properties.
To make matters simpler, let’s pick a concrete n, say n = 5. Let’s begin
by looking at the equivalence classes of the relation ≡ (mod 5). There are
five equivalence classes, as follows:
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
[0] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 0 (mod 5) = x ∈ Z : 5 | (x − 0) = . . . , −10, −5, 0, 5, 10, 15, . . . ,
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
[1] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 1 (mod 5) = x ∈ Z : 5 | (x − 1) = . . . , −9, −4, 1, 6, 11, 16, . . . ,
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
[2] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 2 (mod 5) = x ∈ Z : 5 | (x − 2) = . . . , −8, −3, 2, 7, 12, 17, . . . ,
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
[3] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 3 (mod 5) = x ∈ Z : 5 | (x − 3) = . . . , −7, −2, 3, 8, 13, 18, . . . ,
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
[4] = x ∈ Z : x ≡ 4 (mod 5) = x ∈ Z : 5 | (x − 4) = . . . , −6, −1, 4, 9, 14, 19, . . . .

Notice how these equivalence classes form a partition of the set Z. We
label the five equivalence classes as [0], [1], [2], [3] and [4], but you know of
course that there are other ways to label them. For example, [0] = [5] = [10] =
[15], and so on; and [1] = [6] = [−4], etc. Still, for this discussion we denote
the five classes as [0], [1], [2], [3] and [4].
These five classes form a set, which we shall denote as Z5 . Thus
n
o
Z5 = [0], [1], [2], [3], [4]

is a set of five sets. The interesting thing about Z5 is that even though its
elements are sets (and not numbers), it is possible to add and multiply them.
In fact, we can define the following rules that tell how elements of Z5 can
be added and multiplied.
[a] + [b] = [a + b]
[a] · [b]

=

[a·b]

For example, [2] + [1] = [2 + 1] = [3], and [2] · [2] = [2 · 2] = [4]. We stress that
in doing this we are adding and multiplying sets (more precisely equivalence
classes), not numbers. We added (or multiplied) two elements of Z5 and
obtained another element of Z5 .
Here is a trickier example. Observe that [2] + [3] = [5]. This time we
added elements [2], [3] ∈ Z5 , and got the element [5] ∈ Z5 . That was easy,
©
ª
except where is our answer [5] in the set Z5 = [0], [1], [2], [3], [4] ? Since
[5] = [0], it is more appropriate to write [2] + [3] = [0].

In a similar vein, [2] · [3] = [6] would be written as [2] · [3] = [1] because

We call the set Z5 = [0], [1], [2], [3], [4] the integers modulo 5. As our
tables suggest, Z5 is more than just a set: It is a little number system with
its own addition and multiplication. In this way it is like the familiar set Z
which also comes equipped with an addition and a multiplication.
Of course, there is nothing special about the number 5. We can also
define Zn for any natural number n. Here is the definition:
©

ª

Definition 11.6 Let n ∈ N. The equivalence classes of the equivalence
relation ≡ (mod n) are [0], [1], [2], . . . , [n − 1]. The integers modulo n is
©
ª
the set Zn = [0], [1], [2], . . . , [n − 1] . Elements of Zn can be added by the
rule [a] + [b] = [a + b] and multiplied by the rule [a] · [b] = [ab].
Given a natural number n, the set Zn is a number system containing n
elements. It has many of the algebraic properties that Z, R and Q possess.
For example, it is probably obvious to you already that elements of Zn obey
the commutative laws [a] + [b] = [b] + [a] and [a] · [b] = [b] · [a]. You can also
verify the distributive law [a] · ([b] + [c]) = [a] · [b] + [a] · [c], as follows:
¡
¢
[a] · [b] + [c] = [a] · [b + c]

= [a(b + c)]
= [ab + ac]
= [ab] + [ac]
= [a] · [b] + [a] · [c].

The integers modulo n are significant because they more closely fit certain
applications than do other number systems such as Z or R. If you go on to

take a course in abstract algebra, then you will work extensively with Zn as
well as other, more exotic, number systems. (In such a course you will also
use all of the proof techniques that we have discussed, as well as the ideas
of equivalence relations.)
To close this section we take up an issue that may have bothered you
earlier. It has to do with our definitions of addition [a] + [b] = [a + b] and
multiplication [a] · [b] = [ab]. These definitions define addition and multiplication of equivalence classes in terms of representatives a and b in the
equivalence classes. Since there are many different ways to choose such
representatives, we may well wonder if addition and multiplication are
consistently defined. For example, suppose two people, Alice and Bob, want
to multiply the elements [2] and [3] in Z5 . Alice does the calculation as
[2] · [3] = [6] = [1], so her final answer is [1]. Bob does it differently. Since
[2] = [7] and [3] = [8], he works out [2] · [3] as [7] · [8] = [56]. Since 56 ≡ 1 (mod 5),
Bob’s answer is [56] = [1], and that agrees with Alice’s answer. Will their
answers always agree or did they just get lucky (with the arithmetic)?
The fact is that no matter how they do the multiplication in Zn , their
answers will agree. To see why, suppose Alice and Bob want to multiply
the elements [a], [b] ∈ Zn , and suppose [a] = [a0 ] and [b] = [b0 ]. Alice and Bob
do the multiplication as follows:
Alice:
Bob:

[a] · [b] = [ab],
[a0 ] · [b0 ] = [a0 b0 ].

We need to show that their answers agree, that is, we need to show [ab] =
[a0 b0 ]. Since [a] = [a0 ], we know by Theorem 11.1 that a ≡ a0 (mod n). Thus
n | (a − a0 ), so a − a0 = nk for some integer k. Likewise, as [b] = [b0 ], we know
b ≡ b0 (mod n), or n | (b − b0 ), so b − b0 = n` for some integer `. Thus we get
a = a0 + nk and b = b0 + n`. Therefore:
ab

= (a0 + nk)(b0 + n`)
=

a0 b0 + a0 n` + nkb0 + n2 k`.

Hence ab − a0 b0 = n(a0 ` + kb0 + nk`). This means n | (ab − a0 b0 ), so ab ≡ a0 b0
(mod n), and from that we conclude [ab] = [a0 b0 ]. Consequently Alice and
Bob really do get the same answer, so we can be assured that the definition
of multiplication in Zn is consistent.
Exercise 8 (below) asks you to prove that addition in Zn is similarly
consistent.

11.6 Relations Between Sets
In the beginning of this chapter, we defined a relation on a set A to be a
subset R ⊆ A × A . This created a framework that could model any situation
in which elements of A are compared to themselves. In this setting, the
statement xR y has elements x and y from A on either side of the R because R
compares elements from A . But there are other relational symbols that don’t
work this way. Consider ∈. The statement 5 ∈ Z expresses a relationship
between 5 and Z (namely that the element 5 is in the set Z) but 5 and
Z are not in any way naturally regarded as both elements of some set A .
To overcome this difficulty, we generalize the idea of a relation on A to a
relation from A to B.
Definition 11.7 A relation from a set A to a set B is a subset R ⊆ A × B.
We often abbreviate the statement (x, y) ∈ R as xR y. The statement (x, y) ∉
R is abbreviated as x R
6 y.

Diagrams for relations from A to B differ from diagrams for relations
on A . Since there are two sets A and B in a relation from A to B, we have
to draw labeled nodes for each of the two sets. Then we draw arrows from x
to y whenever xR y. The following figure illustrates this for Example 11.17.

The ideas from this chapter show that any relation (whether it is a
familiar one like ≥, ≤, =, |, ∈ or ⊆, or a more exotic one) is really just a
set. Therefore the theory of relations is a part of the theory of sets. In
the next chapter, we will see that this idea touches on another important
mathematical construction, namely functions. We will define a function to
be a special kind of relation from one set to another, and in this context we
will see that any function is really just a set.

understand and appreciate the fact that relationships between quantities
are central to all scientific disciplines, so you do not need to be convinced
that functions are important. Still, you may not be fully aware of the
significance of functions. Functions are more than merely descriptions of
numeric relationships. In a more general sense, functions can compare and
relate different kinds of mathematical structures. You will see this as your
understanding of mathematics deepens. In preparation of this, we will now
explore a more general and versatile view of functions.
The concept of a relation between sets (Definition 11.7) plays a big role
here, so you may want to quickly review it.

Figure 12.2 shows the graph R as darkened dots in the grid of points Z × N.
Notice that in this example R is not a relation on a single set. The set of
input values Z is different from the set N of output values, so the graph
R ⊆ Z × N is a relation from Z to N.
This example illustrates three things. First, a function can be viewed as
sending elements from one set A to another set B. (In the case of f , A = Z
and B = N.) Second, such a function can be regarded as a relation from A to
B. Third, for every input value n, there is exactly one output value f (n). In
your high school algebra course, this was expressed by the vertical line test:
Any vertical line intersects a function’s graph at most once. It means that
for any input value x, the graph contains exactly one point of form (x, f (x)).
Our main definition, given below, incorporates all of these ideas.
Definition 12.1 Suppose A and B are sets. A function f from A to B
(denoted as f : A → B) is a relation f ⊆ A × B from A to B, satisfying the
property that for each a ∈ A the relation f contains exactly one ordered
pair of form (a, b). The statement (a, b) ∈ f is abbreviated f (a) = b.
Example 12.1 Consider the function f : Z → N graphed in Figure 12.2.
According to Definition 12.1, we regard f as the set of points in its graph,
©
ª
that is, f = (n, | n| + 2) : n ∈ Z ⊆ Z × N. This is a relation from Z to N, and
indeed given any a ∈ Z the set f contains exactly one ordered pair (a, |a| + 2)
whose first coordinate is a. Since (1, 3) ∈ f , we write f (1) = 3; and since
(−3, 5) ∈ f we write f (−3) = 5, etc. In general, (a, b) ∈ f means that f sends
the input value a to the output value b, and we express this as f (a) = b. This

function can be expressed by a formula: For each input value n, the output
value is | n| + 2, so we may write f (n) = | n| + 2. All this agrees with the way
we thought of functions in algebra and calculus; the only difference is that
now we also think of a function as a relation.
Definition 12.2 For a function f : A → B, the set A is called the domain
of f . (Think of the domain as the set of possible “input values” for f .) The
©
ª
set B is called the codomain of f . The range of f is the set f (a) : a ∈ A
©
ª
= b : (a, b) ∈ f . (Think of the range as the set of all possible “output
values” for f . Think of the codomain as a sort of “target” for the outputs.)
Consider the function f : Z → N, where f (n) = | n| + 2, from Example 12.1.
The domain is Z and the codomain is N. The range of this function is the
©
ª ©
ª ©
ª
set f (a) : a ∈ Z = |a| + 2 : a ∈ Z = 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . . Notice that the range is a
subset of the codomain N, but it does not (in this case) equal the codomain.
In general, the range of a function is a subset of the codomain. In this sense
the codomain could have been any set that contains the range. We might
just as well have said that this f is a function f : Z → Z, or even f : Z → R.
This illustrates an important point: the codomain of a function is not
an intrinsic feature of the function; it is more a matter of choice or context.
In Example 12.1 we chose N as the codomain because all the output values
of f are natural numbers. But in general, the codomain of a function can
be any set that contains the function’s range as a subset.
In our examples so far, the domains and codomains are sets of numbers,
but this needn’t be the case in general, as the next example indicates.

Example 12.2 Let A = p, q, r, s and B = 0, 1, 2 , and
©
ª
f = (p, 0), (q, 1), (r, 2), (s, 2) ⊆ A × B.

This is a function f : A → B because each element of A occurs exactly once
as a first coordinate of an ordered pair in f . Observe that we have f (p) = 0,
©
ª
f (q) = 1, f (r) = 2 and f (s) = 2. The domain of this function is A = p, q, r, s .
©
ª
The codomain and range are both B = 0, 1, 2 .
If A and B are not both sets of numbers (as in this example), it can be
difficult to draw a graph of f : A → B in the traditional sense. Figure 12.3(a)
is an attempt at a graph of f . The sets A and B are aligned as x- and y-axes,
and the Cartesian product A × B is filled in accordingly. The subset f ⊆ A × B
is indicated with dashed lines, and we can regard it as a “graph” of f .
Figure 12.3(b) shows a more natural visual description of f . The sets A and
B are drawn side-by-side, and arrows point from a to b whenever f (a) = b.

Figure 12.3. Two ways of drawing the function f = (p, 0), (q, 1), (r, 2), (s, 2)

In general, if f : A → B is the kind of function you may have encountered
in algebra or calculus, then conventional graphing techniques offer the best
visual description of it. On the other hand, if A and B are finite or if we are
thinking of them as generic sets, then describing f with arrows is often a
more appropriate way of visualizing it.
We emphasize that, according to Definition 12.1, a function is really
just a special kind of set. Any function f : A → B is a subset of A × B. By
contrast, your calculus text probably defined a function as a certain kind of
“rule.” While that intuitive outlook is adequate for the first few semesters
of calculus, it does not hold up well to the rigorous mathematical standards
necessary for further progress. The problem is that words like “rule” are
too vague. Defining a function as a set removes the ambiguity. It makes a
function into a concrete mathematical object.
Still, in practice we tend to think of functions as rules. Given f : Z → N
where f (n) = |n| + 2, we think of this as a rule that associates any number
n ∈ Z to the number | n| + 2 in N, rather than a set containing ordered pairs
(n, | n|+ 2). It is only when we have to understand or interpret the theoretical
nature of functions (as we do in this text) that Definition 12.1 comes to bear.
The definition is a foundation that gives us license to think about functions
in a more informal way. For instance, suppose we are discussing a set of
functions, such as the set S of all functions R → R. Without Definition 12.1,
it would be unclear just what kinds of objects the elements of S are. But
with Definition 12.1, we know exactly what the elements are: each element
of S is a subset f ⊆ R × R. So we are free to think of S as a collection of “rules,”
and can fall back on Definition 12.1 when greater scrutiny is required.

The next example brings up a point about notation. Consider a function
such as f : Z2 → Z, whose domain is a Cartesian product. This function takes
as input an ordered pair (m, n) ∈ Z2 and sends it to a number f ((m, n)) ∈ Z.
To simplify the notation, it is common to write f (m, n) instead of f ((m, n)),
even though this is like writing f x instead of f (x). We also remark that
although we’ve been using the letters f , g and h to denote functions, any
other reasonable symbol could be used. Greek letters such as ϕ and θ are
common.
Example 12.3 Say a function ϕ : Z2 → Z is defined as ϕ(m, n) = 6m − 9n.
©¡
¢
ª
Note that as a set, this function is ϕ = (m, n), 6m − 9n : (m, n) ∈ Z2 ⊆ Z2 × Z.
What is the range of ϕ?
To answer this, first observe that for any (m, n) ∈ Z2 , the value ϕ(m, n) =
6m − 9n = 3(2m − 3n) is a multiple of 3. Thus every number in the range is
a multiple of 3, so the range is a subset of the set of all multiples of 3. On
the other hand if b = 3k is a multiple of 3 we have ϕ(−k, −k) = 6(−k) − 9(−k) =
3k = b, which means any multiple of 3 is in the range of ϕ. Therefore the
©
ª
range of ϕ is the set 3k : k ∈ Z of all multiples of 3.
To conclude this section, let’s use Definition 12.1 to help us understand
what it means for two functions f : A → B and g : C → D to be equal. The
definition says f and g are subsets f ⊆ A × B and g ⊆ C × D . It makes sense
to say that f and g are equal if f = g, that is, if they are equal as sets.
©
ª
©
ª
Thus the two functions f = (1, a), (2, a), (3, b) and g = (3, b), (2, a), (1, a)
are equal because the sets f and g are equal. Notice that the domain of
©
ª
both functions is A = 1, 2, 3 , the set of first elements x in the ordered pairs
(x, y) ∈ f = g. In general, equal functions must have equal domains.
Observe also that the equality f = g means f (x) = g(x) for every x ∈ A .
We repackage these ideas in the following definition.
Definition 12.3 Two functions f : A → B and g : A → D are equal if
f = g (as sets). Equivalently, f = g if and only if f (x) = g(x) for every x ∈ A .
Observe that f and g can have different codomains and still be equal.
Consider the functions f : Z → N and g : Z → Z defined as f (x) = | x| + 2 and
g(x) = | x| + 2. Even though their codomains are different, the functions are
equal because f (x) = g(x) for every x in the domain. If you are bothered that
these equal functions have different codomains, recall that we remarked
on page 225 that a function’s codomain is not really an intrinsic feature of
the function, but more a matter of convenience. (Any set that contains the
range as a subset is a valid choice of codomain.)

12.2 Injective and Surjective Functions
You may recall from algebra and calculus that a function may be one-to-one
and onto, and these properties are related to whether or not the function is
invertible. We now review these important ideas. In advanced mathematics,
the word injective is often used instead of one-to-one, and surjective is used
instead of onto. Here are the exact definitions:
Definition 12.4

A function f : A → B is:

1. injective (or one-to-one) if for all a, a0 ∈ A , a 6= a0 implies f (a) 6= f (a0 );
2. surjective (or onto B) if for every b ∈ B there is an a ∈ A with f (a) = b;
3. bijective if f is both injective and surjective.
Below is a visual description of Definition 12.4. In essence, injective
means that unequal elements in A always get sent to unequal elements
in B. Surjective means that every element of B has an arrow pointing to it,
that is, it equals f (a) for some a in the domain of f .

For more concrete examples, consider the following functions f, g : R → R.
The function f (x) = x2 is not injective because −2 6= 2, but f (−2) = f (2). Nor
is it surjective, for if b = −1 (or if b is any negative number), then there is
no a ∈ R with f (a) = b. On the other hand, g(x) = x3 is both injective and
surjective, so it is also bijective.
Notice that whether or not f is surjective depends on its codomain. For
example, f (x) = x2 is not surjective as a function R → R, but it is surjective
as a function R → [0, ∞). When we speak of a function being surjective, we
always have in mind a particular codomain.
There are four possible injective/surjective combinations that a function
may possess. This is illustrated below for four functions A → B. Functions
in the first column are injective, those in the second column are not injective.
Functions in the first row are surjective, those in the second row are not.

Often it is necessary to prove that a particular function f : A → B is
injective. For this, Definition 12.4 says we must prove that for any two
¡
¢
elements a, a0 ∈ A , the conditional statement (a 6= a0 ) ⇒ f (a) 6= f (a0 ) is true.
The two main approaches for this are summarized below.
How to show a function f : A → B is injective:
Direct approach:
Suppose a, a0 ∈ A and a 6= a0 .
..
.

Contrapositive approach:
Suppose a, a0 ∈ A and f (a) = f (a0 ).
..
.

Therefore f (a) 6= f (a0 ).

Therefore a = a0 .

Of these two approaches, the contrapositive is often the easiest to use,
especially if f is defined by an algebraic formula. This is because the
contrapositive approach starts with the equation f (a) = f (a0 ) and proceeds
to the equation a = a0 . In algebra, as you know, it is usually easier to work
with equations than inequalities.
To prove that a function is not injective, you must disprove the statement
¡
¢
(a 6= a0 ) ⇒ f (a) 6= f (a0 ) . For this it suffices to find example of two elements
a, a0 ∈ A for which a 6= a0 and f (a) = f (a0 ).
Next we examine how to prove that f : A → B is surjective. According
to Definition 12.4, we must prove the statement ∀ b ∈ B, ∃ a ∈ A, f (a) = b. In
words, we must show that for any b ∈ B, there is at least one a ∈ A (which
may depend on b) having the property that f (a) = b. Here is an outline:
How to show a function f : A → B is surjective:
Suppose b ∈ B.
[Prove there exists a ∈ A for which f (a) = b.]
The second line involves proving the existence of an a for which f (a) = b.
For this, just finding an example of such an a would suffice. (How to find
such an example depends on how f is defined. If f is given as a formula,
we may be able to find a by solving the equation f (a) = b for a. Sometimes
you can find a by just plain common sense.) To show f is not surjective, we
must prove the negation of ∀ b ∈ B, ∃ a ∈ A, f (a) = b, that is, we must prove
∃ b ∈ B, ∀ a ∈ A, f (a) 6= b.
The following examples illustrate these ideas. (For the first example,

note that the set R − 0 is R with the number 0 removed.)

Example 12.4 Show that the function f : R − 0 → R defined as f (x) = 1x + 1
is injective but not surjective.
We will use the contrapositive approach to show that f is injective.
© ª
Suppose a, a0 ∈ R − 0 and f (a) = f (a0 ). This means a1 + 1 = a10 + 1. Subtracting 1
from both sides and inverting produces a = a0 . Therefore f is injective.

Example 12.6 Show that the function g : Z × Z → Z × Z defined by the
formula g(m, n) = (m + n, m + 2n), is both injective and surjective.
We will use the contrapositive approach to show that g is injective.
Thus we need to show that g(m, n) = g(k, `) implies (m, n) = (k, `). Suppose
(m, n), (k, `) ∈ Z × Z and g(m, n) = g(k, `). Then (m + n, m + 2n) = (k + `, k + 2`). It
follows that m + n = k + ` and m + 2n = k + 2`. Subtracting the first equation
from the second gives n = `. Next, subtract n = ` from m + n = k + ` to get
m = k. Since m = k and n = `, it follows that (m, n) = (k, `). Thus g is injective.
To see that g is surjective, consider an arbitrary element (b, c) ∈ Z × Z.
We need to show that there is some (x, y) ∈ Z × Z for which g(x, y) = (b, c). To
find (x, y), note that g(x, y) = (b, c) means (x + y, x + 2y) = (b, c). This leads to
the following system of equations:
x +
y =
x + 2y =

b
c.

Solving gives x = 2b − c and y = c − b. Then (x, y) = (2b − c, c − b). We now
have g(2b − c, c − b) = (b, c), and it follows that g is surjective.
Example 12.7 Consider function h : Z × Z → Q defined as h(m, n) =

m
.
| n| + 1

Determine whether this is injective and whether it is surjective.
This function is not injective because of the unequal elements (1, 2) and
(1, −2) in Z × Z for which h(1, 2) = h(1, −2) = 13 . However, h is surjective: Take
any element b ∈ Q. Then b = dc for some c, d ∈ Z. Notice we may assume d is
positive by making c negative, if necessary. Then h(c, d − 1) = |d −1c |+1 = dc = b.

The Pigeonhole Principle Revisited

233

12.3 The Pigeonhole Principle Revisited
We first encountered a result called the pigeonhole principle in Section 3.9.
It turns out that the pigeonhole principle has a useful phrasing in the
language of injective and surjective functions, and we now discuss this. Our
discussion will not use any material from Chapter 3, so it does not matter
if you skipped it.
The pigeonhole principle is motivated by a simple thought experiment:
Imagine there is a set A of pigeons and a set B of pigeonholes, and all
the pigeons fly into the pigeonholes. You can think of this as describing a
function f : A → B, where pigeon p flies into pigeonhole f (p). See Figure 12.4.

Figure 12.4. The pigeonhole principle
In Figure 12.4(a) there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, and it is
obvious that in such a case at least two pigeons have to fly into the same
pigeonhole, meaning that f is not injective. In Figure 12.4(b) there are
fewer pigeons than pigeonholes, so clearly at least one pigeonhole remains
empty, meaning that f is not surjective.
Although the underlying idea expressed by these figures has little to do
with pigeons, it is nonetheless called the pigeonhole principle:
The Pigeonhole Principle (function version)
Suppose A and B are finite sets and f : A → B is any function.
1. If | A | > |B|, then f is not injective.
2. If | A | < |B|, then f is not surjective.
Though the pigeonhole principle is obvious, it can be used to prove some
things that are not so obvious. Two examples follow.

Proposition If A is any set of 10 integers between 1 and 100, then there
exist two different subsets X ⊆ A and Y ⊆ A for which the sum of elements
in X equals the sum of elements in Y .

which has subsets X = 7, 12, 17, 50 and Y = 6, 80 both of whose elements
add up to the same number (86). The proposition asserts that this is always
possible, no matter what A is. Here is a proof:
Proof. Suppose A ⊆ 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , 99, 100 and | A | = 10, as stated. Notice that
if X ⊆ A , then X has no more than 10 elements, each between 1 and 100,
and therefore the sum of all the elements of X is less than 100 · 10 = 1000.

follows from the pigeonhole principle that f is not injective. Therefore there
are two unequal sets X , Y ∈ P (A) for which f (X ) = f (Y ). In other words,
there are subsets X ⊆ A and Y ⊆ A for which the sum of elements in X
equals the sum of elements in Y .

asserts that f is not injective. Thus there are two Texans x and y for whom
f (x) = f (y), meaning that they have the same number of hairs on their
heads.

Proofs that use the pigeonhole principle tend to be inherently nonconstructive, in the sense discussed in Section 7.4. For example, the above
proof does not explicitly give us two Texans with the same number of hairs
on their heads; it only shows that two such people exist. If we were to make
a constructive proof, we could find examples of two bald Texans. Then they
have the same number of head hairs, namely zero.

12.4 Composition
You are familiar with the notion of function composition from algebra and
calculus. Still, it is worthwhile to revisit it now with our more sophisticated
ideas about functions.
Definition 12.5 Suppose f : A → B and g : B → C are functions with the
property that the codomain of f equals the domain of g. The composition
of f with g is another function, denoted as g ◦ f and defined as follows: If
x ∈ A , then g◦ f (x) = g( f (x)). Therefore g◦ f sends elements of A to elements
of C , so g ◦ f : A → C .
The following figure illustrates the definition. Here f : A → B, g : B → C ,
and g ◦ f : A → C . We have, for example, g ◦ f (0) = g( f (0)) = g(2) = 4. Be very

symbol g ◦ f , we work out g ◦ f (x) as g( f (x)), with f acting on x first, followed
by g acting on f (x).

Notice that the composition g ◦ f also makes sense if the range of f
is a subset of the domain of g. You should take note of this fact, but to

©
ª
g = (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1) . In this situation the composition g ◦ f is not defined
because the codomain B of f is not the same set as the domain C of g.
Remember: In order for g ◦ f to make sense, the codomain of f must equal
the domain of g. (Or at least be a subset of it.)
Example 12.10 Let f : R → R be defined as f (x) = x2 + x, and g : R → R be
defined as g(x) = x + 1. Then g ◦ f : R → R is the function defined by the formula
g ◦ f (x) = g( f (x)) = g(x2 + x) = x2 + x + 1.
Since the domains and codomains of g and f are the same, we can in
this case do a composition in the other order. Note that f ◦ g : R → R is the
function defined as f ◦ g (x) = f (g(x)) = f (x + 1) = (x + 1)2 + (x + 1) = x2 + 3x + 2.
This example illustrates that even when g ◦ f and f ◦ g are both defined,
they are not necessarily equal. We can express this fact by saying function
composition is not commutative.

We close this section by proving several facts about composition that you
are likely to encounter in your future study of mathematics. First, we note
that, although it is not commutative, function composition is associative.
Theorem 12.1 Composition of functions is associative. That is if f : A → B,
g : B → C and h : C → D , then (h ◦ g) ◦ f = h ◦ (g ◦ f ).
Proof. Suppose f , g, h are as stated. It follows from Definition 12.5 that
both (h ◦ g) ◦ f and h ◦ (g ◦ f ) are functions from A to D . To show that they
are equal, we just need to show

(h ◦ g) ◦ f (x) = h ◦ (g ◦ f ) (x)

Theorem 12.2 Suppose f : A → B and g : B → C . If both f and g are
injective, then g ◦ f is injective. If both f and g are surjective, then g ◦ f is
surjective.
Proof. First suppose both f and g are injective. To see that g ◦ f is injective,
we must show that g ◦ f (x) = g ◦ f (y) implies x = y. Suppose g ◦ f (x) = g ◦ f (y).
This means g( f (x)) = g( f (y)). It follows that f (x) = f (y). (For otherwise g
wouldn’t be injective.) But since f (x) = f (y) and f is injective, it must be
that x = y. Therefore g ◦ f is injective.
Next suppose both f and g are surjective. To see that g ◦ f is surjective,
we must show that for any element c ∈ C , there is a corresponding element
a ∈ A for which g ◦ f (a) = c. Thus consider an arbitrary c ∈ C . Because g
is surjective, there is an element b ∈ B for which g(b) = c. And because
f is surjective, there is an element a ∈ A for which f (a) = b. Therefore
g( f (a)) = g(b) = c, which means g ◦ f (a) = c. Thus g ◦ f is surjective.

12.5 Inverse Functions
You may recall from calculus that if a function f is injective and surjective,
then it has an inverse function f −1 that “undoes” the effect of f in the sense
¡
¢
that f −1 f (x) = x for every x in the domain. (For example, if f (x) = x3 , then
p
f −1 (x) = 3 x.) We now review these ideas. Our approach uses two ingredients,
outlined in the following definitions.
Definition 12.6 For a set A , the identity function on A is the function
i A : A → A defined as i A (x) = x for every x ∈ A .
Example: If A = 1, 2, 3 , then i A = (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) . Also i Z = (n, n) : n ∈ Z .
The identity function on a set is the function that sends any element of the
set to itself.
Notice that for any set A , the identity function i A is bijective: It is
injective because i A (x) = i A (y) immediately reduces to x = y. It is surjective

because if we take any element b in the codomain A , then b is also in the
domain A , and i A (b) = b.
Definition 12.7 Given a relation R from A to B, the inverse relation
©
ª
of R is the relation from B to A defined as R −1 = (y, x) : (x, y) ∈ R . In other
words, the inverse of R is the relation R −1 obtained by interchanging the
elements in every ordered pair in R .

For example, let A = a, b, c and B = 1, 2, 3 , and suppose f is the relation
©
ª
©
ª
f = (a, 2), (b, 3), (c, 1) from A to B. Then f −1 = (2, a), (3, b), (1, c) and this is a
relation from B to A . Notice that f is actually a function from A to B, and
f −1 is a function from B to A . These two relations are drawn below. Notice
the drawing for relation f −1 is just the drawing for f with arrows reversed.

For another example, let A and B be the same sets as above, but consider

©
ª
the relation g = (a, 2), (b, 3), (c, 3) from A to B. Then g−1 = (2, a), (3, b), (3, c)

This time, even though the relation g is a function, its inverse g−1 is not
a function because the element 3 occurs twice as a first coordinate of an
ordered pair in g−1 .
In the above examples, relations f and g are both functions, and f −1 is a
function and g−1 is not. This raises a question: What properties does f have
and g lack that makes f −1 a function and g−1 not a function? The answer
is not hard to see. Function g is not injective because g(b) = g(c) = 3, and
thus (b, 3) and (c, 3) are both in g. This causes a problem with g−1 because
it means (3, b) and (3, c) are both in g−1 , so g−1 can’t be a function. Thus, in
order for g−1 to be a function, it would be necessary that g be injective.

But that is not enough. Function g also fails to be surjective because
no element of A is sent to the element 1 ∈ B. This means g−1 contains no
ordered pair whose first coordinate is 1, so it can’t be a function from B to
A . If g−1 were to be a function it would be necessary that g be surjective.
The previous two paragraphs suggest that if g is a function, then it must
be bijective in order for its inverse relation g−1 to be a function. Indeed,
this is easy to verify. Conversely, if a function is bijective, then its inverse
relation is easily seen to be a function. We summarize this in the following
theorem.
Theorem 12.3 Let f : A → B be a function. Then f is bijective if and only
if the inverse relation f −1 is a function from B to A .
Suppose f : A → B is bijective, so according to the theorem f −1 is a
function. Observe that the relation f contains all the pairs (x, f (x)) for x ∈ A ,
so f −1 contains all the pairs ( f (x), x). But ( f (x), x) ∈ f −1 means f −1 ( f (x)) = x.
Therefore f −1 ◦ f (x) = x for every x ∈ A . From this we get f −1 ◦ f = i A . Similar
reasoning produces f ◦ f −1 = i B . This leads to the following definitions.
Definition 12.8 If f : A → B is bijective then its inverse is the function
f −1 : B → A . The functions f and f −1 obey the equations f −1 ◦ f = i A and
f ◦ f −1 = i B .
You probably recall from algebra at least one technique for computing
the inverse of a bijective function f . To find f −1 , start with the equation
y = f (x). Then interchange variables to get x = f (y). Solving this equation
for y (if possible) produces y = f −1 (x). The next two examples illustrate this.
Example 12.11 The function f : R → R defined as f (x) = x3 + 1 is bijective.
Find its inverse.
We begin by writing y = x3 + 1. Now interchange variables to obtain
p
3
x = y3 + 1. Solving for y produces y = x − 1. Thus
f −1 (x) =

x − 1.

(You can check your answer by computing
f −1 ( f (x)) =

p
3

f (x) − 1 =

x3 + 1 − 1 = x.

Therefore f −1 ( f (x)) = x. Any answer other than x indicates a mistake.)

Example 12.12 Example 12.6 showed that the function g : Z × Z → Z × Z
defined by the formula g(m, n) = (m + n, m + 2n) is bijective. Find its inverse.
The approach outlined above should work, but we need to be careful to
keep track of coordinates in Z × Z. We begin by writing (x, y) = g(m, n), then
interchanging the variables (x, y) and (m, n) to get (m, n) = g(x, y). This gives
(m, n) = (x + y, x + 2y),

12.6 Image and Preimage

It is time to take up a matter of notation that you will encounter in future
mathematics classes. Suppose we have a function f : A → B. If X ⊆ A , the
©
ª
expression f (X ) has a special meaning. It stands for the set f (x) : x ∈ X .
And if Y ⊆ B, then f −1 (Y ) has a meaning even if f is not invertible: it stands
©
ª
for the set x ∈ A : f (x) ∈ Y . Here are the precise definitions.
Definition 12.9 Suppose f : A → B is a function.
©
ª
1. If X ⊆ A , the image of X is the set f (X ) = f (x) : x ∈ X ⊆ B.
2. If Y ⊆ B, the preimage of Y is the set f −1 (Y ) = x ∈ A : f (x) ∈ Y ⊆ A .
©

ª

In words, the image f (X ) of X is the set of all things in B that f sends
elements of X to. (Roughly speaking, you might think of f (X ) as a kind of
distorted “copy” or “image” of X in B.) The preimage f −1 (Y ) of Y is the set
of all things in A that f sends into Y .
Maybe you have already encountered these ideas in linear algebra, in
a setting involving a linear transformation T : V → W between two vector
spaces. If X ⊆ V is a subspace of V , then its image T(X ) is a subspace of W .
If Y ⊆ W is a subspace of W , then its preimage T −1 (Y ) is a subspace of V .
(If this does not sound familiar, then ignore it.)

CHAPTER 13

Proofs in Calculus

he proofs we have dealt with so far in this text have been largely proofs
about integers, or about structures related to integers (divisibility,
congruence modulo n, sets of integers, relations among integers, functions
of integers, etc.).
Of course mathematics is not restricted to just integers. Calculus is
built on the system of real numbers R. Thus the main definitions in calculus
cater to R. Consequently the proofs in calculus (which use the definitions)
have a distinct flavor that is quite different from proofs in other areas of
mathematics. In reading and writing proofs in calculus you will still use the
main proof techniques (direct, contrapositive, contradiction), but it can take
some time to adjust your thinking to the idiosyncrasies of R. This chapter
is intended to ease that adjustment. It is an introduction to some of the
ideas you will encounter in later courses in advanced calculus (also called
analysis). This chapter is not needed for the remainder of the text, so it can
be skipped without a loss of continuity.
Single-variable calculus (the first two semesters of a standard calculus
sequence) deals with functions f : R → R, or more generally f : X → R for
X ⊆ R. Usually the domain X is an interval or a union of intervals. For
2
example, f (x) = ( x−x1)(+x5−2) is a function f : (−∞, 1) ∪ (1, 2) ∪ (2, ∞) → R, whereas
p
f (x) = x has domain X = [0, ∞), and f (x) = x2 − x has domain X = (−∞, ∞) = R.
Calculus rests on the idea of a limit, and it is the limit that separates
calculus from algebra and trigonometry. We will study limits in sections 13.2
through 13.6. It is assumed that you have had a prior course in calculus
and already have some experience with limits. But our present treatment is
more theoretical. It serves the double purpose of putting your earlier work
on a firmer foundation while preparing you for more advanced studies.
Another calculus topic (typically from the second semester of a standard
course) concerns sequences and series, where functions f : N → R play a
major role. We will turn to this in sections 13.7 and 13.8.
All of this requires a result called the triangle inequality, so we begin
there.

The Triangle Inequality

245

13.1 The Triangle Inequality
Definitions in calculus and analysis use absolute value extensively. As you
know, the absolute value of a real number x is the non-negative number
½

| x| =

x
−x

if x ≥ 0
if x < 0.

Fundamental properties of absolute value include | x y| = | x| · | y| and x ≤ | x|.
Another property—used often in proofs—is the triangle inequality:
Theorem 13.1 (Triangle inequality) If x, y, z ∈ R, then | x − y| ≤ | x − z|+| z − y|.
Proof. The name triangle inequality comes from the fact that the theorem
can be interpreted as asserting that for any “triangle” on the number line,
the length of any side never exceeds the sum of the lengths of the other two
sides. Indeed, the distance between any two numbers a, b ∈ R is |a − b|. With
this in mind, observe in the diagrams below that regardless of the order of
x, y, z on the number line, the inequality | x − y| ≤ | x − z| + | z − y| holds.
| x− y| | z− y|

| x− y| | x− z|

| x− z| | x− y|

(These diagrams show x, y, z as distinct points. If x = y, x = z or y = z, then
| x − y| ≤ | x − z| + | z − y| holds automatically.)
■
The triangle inequality says the shortest route from x to y avoids z unless
z lies between x and y. Several useful results flow from it. Put z = 0 to get
| x − y| ≤ | x| + | y| for any x, y ∈ R.

(13.1)

Using the triangle inequality, | x + y| = | x − (− y)| ≤ | x − 0|+|0 − (− y)| = | x|+| y|, so
| x + y| ≤ | x| + | y| for any x, y ∈ R.

(13.2)

Also by the triangle inequality, | x − 0| ≤ | x − (− y)| + | − y − 0|, which yields
| x| − | y| ≤ | x + y| for any x, y ∈ R.

(13.3)

The three inequalities (13.1), (13.2) and (13.3) are very useful in proofs.

13.2 Definition of a Limit

Limits are designed to deal with the following type of problem: We need to
know how a certain function f (x) behaves when x is close to some number c.
Perhaps f (c) is not even defined, so the graph of f looks something like what
is shown below; a curve with a hole at a point (c, L).

y = f (x)

x→ c

x−→ c←−x

x

In this picture, for any x 6= c, the corresponding value f (x) is either greater
than L or less than L. But the closer x is to c, the closer f (x) is to L, as
illustrated on the right. We express this as lim f (x) = L. That is, the symbols
x→ c
lim f (x) stand for the number that f (x) approaches as x approaches c.
x→ c
Your calculus text probably presented an informal, intuitive definition
of a limit that likely went something like this.
Definition 13.1 (Informal definition of a limit)
Suppose f is a function and c is a number. Then lim f (x) = L means that
x→ c
f (x) is arbitrarily close to L provided that x is sufficiently close to c.
The idea is that no matter how close we want to make f (x) to L, we can
be assured that it will be that close (or closer) if x is close enough to c.
Definition 13.1 is sufficient for the first few semesters of calculus, but it
is not adequate for deeper, more rigorous investigations. The problem is
that it is too vague. What, exactly, is meant by close? Saying x is “close” to c
is not much better than saying that an integer n is “sort of even.” No proof
can be done in the presence of such ambiguity.
So this section’s first task is to motivate and develop a more rigorous and
precise limit definition, the one used in advanced calculus. Achieving this
goal forces us the grapple with the imprecise term close. What do we mean
by close? Within 0.1 units? Within 0.001 or 0.00001 units, or even closer?
We will make the definition precise by introducing a numeric, quantitative
measure of closeness.

Definition of a Limit

247

Standard practice uses the Greek letters ε (epsilon) and δ (delta) for
variables representing how close f (x) is to L, and x is to c. For instance,
x is within a distance of δ from c if and only if c − δ < x < c + δ, that is,
−δ < x − c < δ, or | x − c| < δ. So for any real number δ > 0 (no matter how
small) the statement | x − c| < δ means that x is within δ units from c.

Likewise | f (x) − L| < ε means that f (x) is within ε units from L. Let’s apply
these ideas to Definition 13.1, and transform it line by line.
Informal definition

Precise definition

lim f (x) = L means that

lim f (x) = L means that

f (x) is arbitrarily close to L

for any ε > 0, | f (x) − L| < ε
provided that
0 < | x − c| < δ for some δ > 0.

x→ c

x→ c

provided that
x is sufficiently close to c

We have arrived at a precise definition of a limit.
Definition 13.2 (Precise definition of a limit)
Suppose f : X → R is a function, where X ⊆ R, and c ∈ R. Then lim f (x) = L
x→ c
means that for any real ε > 0 (no matter how small), there is a real number
δ > 0 for which | f (x) − L| < ε provided that 0 < | x − c| < δ.
Figure 13.1 illustrates this. For any ε > 0, no matter how small, consider
the narrow shaded band of points on the plane whose y-coordinates are
between y = L − ε and y = L + ε. Given this ε, we can find another number
δ > 0 such that the point (x, f (x)) is in the shaded band whenever x is within
δ units from c. In other words, | f (x) − L| < ε provided that 0 < | x − c| < δ.

Three comments are in order. First, we have slipped into Definition 13.2
the expression 0 < | x − c| < δ instead of | x − c| < δ. This is to rule out the
possibility x = c, as f (c) may not be defined, depending of f and c.
Second, Definition 13.2 applies only if there is some δ > 0 for which
(c − δ, c) ∪ (c, c + δ) is a subset of the domain of f . Otherwise the statement
“| f (x) − L| provided that 0 < | x − c| < δ” is meaningless for some x, no matter
how small δ is. Thus lim f (x) makes sense only if f (x) is defined for all x ∈ R
x→ c
that are “close to” c in the sense that x ∈ (c − δ, c) ∪ (c, c + δ) for some δ.
Third, in symbolic form Definition 13.2 says lim f (x) = L if and only if
x→ c

¡
¢ ¡
¢
∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, 0 < | x − c| < δ ⇒ | f (x) − L| < ε .

(13.4)

Thus proving lim f (x) = L amounts to proving that Statement (13.4) is true.
x→ c
One strategy for proving Statement (13.4) is the direct approach. Begin
¡
¢ ¡
¢
by assuming ε > 0. Then find a δ for which 0 < | x − c| < δ ⇒ | f (x) − L| < ε .
To find δ, try to extract a factor of | x − c| from | f (x) − L|. If you can do this,
inspection usually tells you how small | x − c| needs to be to make | f (x) − L| < ε.
We will use this strategy in Example 13.1, which proves lim (3x + 4) = 10.
x→2

Here f (x) = 3x + 4 and L = 10, so | f (x) − L| is |(3x + 4) − 10|. Also | x − c| is | x − 2|.
Example 13.1

Prove that lim (3x + 4) = 10.
x →2

Proof. Suppose ε > 0. Note that |(3x + 4) − 10| = |3x − 6| = |3(x − 2)| = 3| x − 2|.
So if δ = 3ε , then 0 < | x − 2| < δ yields |(3x + 4) − 10| = 3| x − 2| < 3δ = 3 3ε = ε.
In summary, for any ε > 0, there is a δ = 3ε for which 0 < | x − 2| < δ implies
|(3x + 4) − 10| < ε. By Definition 13.2, lim (3x + 4) = 10.
■
x→2

Example 13.2 Prove that lim 5x2 = 20.
x→2

Proof. Suppose ε > 0. Notice that
| f (x) − L| = |5x2 − 20| = |5(x2 − 4)| = |5(x − 2)(x + 2)| = 5 · | x − 2| · | x + 2|.

Now we have a factor of | x − 2| in | f (x) − L|, but it is accompanied with | x + 2|.
But if | x − 2| is small, then x is close to 2, so | x + 2| should be close to 4. In
fact, if | x − 2| ≤ 1, then | x + 2| = |(x − 2) + 4| ≤ | x − 2| + |4| ≤ 1 + 4 = 5. (Here we
applied the inequality (13.2) from page 245.) In other words, if | x − 2| ≤ 1,
then | x + 2| ≤ 5, and the above equation yields
| f (x) − L| = |5x2 − 20| = 5 · | x − 2| · | x + 2| < 5 · | x − 2| · 5 = 25| x − 2|.
ε
Take δ to be smaller than both 1 and 25
. Then 0 < | x − 2| < δ implies
ε
2
|5x − 20| < 25 · | x − 2| < 25δ < 25 25 = ε. By Definition 13.2, lim 5x2 = 20.

The examples above (and the exercises below) involve limits that you
probably regard as obvious. Our point is to illustrate Definition 13.2, not to
compute difficult limits. Difficult limits come later (mostly in more advanced
courses, not in this book) where Definition 13.2 will be used to great effect.

13.3 Limits That Do Not Exist
Given a function f and a number c, there are two ways that lim f (x) = L can
x→ c
be false. First, there may be a different number M 6= L for which lim f (x) = M .
x→ c
Second, it may be that Statement (13.4) is false for all L ∈ R. In such a case
we say that lim f (x) does not exist. Contradiction is one way to prove that
x→ c
lim f (x) does not exist. Assume lim f (x) = L and produce a contradiction.

If x > 2, then x − 2 is positive, so | x − 2| = x − 2 and | xx−

One final point. We remarked on page 248 that for lim f (x) = L to make

sense, there must be a δ for which f (x) is defined for all x ∈ (c − δ, c) ∪ (c, c + δ).
Thus, for example, following Definition 13.2 to the letter, we have to say that

13.4 Limit Laws
When you studied Calculus
I´ your
text´ presented a number of limit laws,
³
³
such as lim f (x)g(x) = lim f (x) · lim g(x) . These laws allowed you to compute
x→ c
x→ c
x→ c
complex limits by reducing them to simpler limits, until the answer was at
hand. But your calculus text probably did not prove the laws. Rather, you
were asked to accept them as intuitively plausible (and useful) facts.
Using Definition 13.2, we now present proofs of some limit laws. This
serves two purposes. First, it puts your knowledge of calculus on a firmer
foundation. Second, it highlights various strategies and thought patterns
that are useful in limit proofs, which come to bear in later courses and work.
The inequalities (13.1), (13.2) and (13.3) from page 245 play a crucial
role. For convenience we repeat them here. For any x, y ∈ R,
| x − y| ≤ | x | + | y| ,

| x + y| ≤ | x| + | y|,

and

| x| − | y| ≤ | x + y|.

We will use these frequently, usually without comment.
Our first limit law concerns the constant function f (x) = a where a ∈ R.
Its graph is a horizontal line with y-intercept a. It should be obvious that
lim f (x) = a for any real number c. Nonetheless, let’s prove this obvious fact.
x→ c

Theorem 13.2 (Constant function rule)

If a ∈ R, then lim a = a.
x→ c

Proof. Suppose a ∈ R. According to Definition 13.2, to prove lim a = a, we
x→ c
must show that for any ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 for which 0 < | x − c| < δ implies
|a − a| < ε. This is almost too easy. Just let δ = 1 (or any other number). Then
|a − a| < ε is automatic, because |a − a| = 0.

The identity function f : R → R is f (x) = x. Next we prove lim f (x) = c.

Theorem 13.3 (Identity function rule)

If c ∈ R, then lim x = c.

Proof. Given ε > 0, let δ = ε. Then 0 < | x − c| < δ implies | x − c| < ε. By

255

Though you may not have proved any limit laws in your calculus course,
you used them extensively. A common situation involved lim f (x), where f (c)
x→ c
was undefined because of a zero denominator. You learned to overcome this
by algebraically canceling the offending part of the denominator.

Here x approaches 1, but simply plugging in x = 1 gives 11 −1 = 00 (undefined).

13.5 Continuity and Derivatives

A major purpose of limits is that they can give information about how a
function behaves near a “bad point” x = c. Even if f (c) is not defined, it may
be that lim f (x) = L, for some number L. In this event we know that f (x)
x→ c
becomes ever closer to L as x approaches the forbidden c.
Of course not every value x = c is a “bad point.” It could be that f (c) is
defined, and, moreover, lim f (x) = f (c). If this is the case for every c in the
x→ c
domain of f (x), then we say that f is continuous. Issues concerning whether
or not f is continuous are called issues of continuity.
In a first course in calculus it is easy to overlook the huge importance
of continuity. And happily, we can (in a first course) almost ignore it. But
in fact, the theoretical foundation of calculus rests on continuity. Roughly
speaking, there are countless theorems having the form
If f is continuous, then f has some significant property.
Continuity allows us to draw certain important conclusions about a function.
Here is its definition.
Definition 13.3 A function f (x) is continuous at x = c if lim f (x) = f (c).
x→ c
Note that this means all of the following three conditions must be met:
1.

f (c) is defined,

2.

lim f (x) exists,
x→ c

3. lim f (x) = f (c).
x→ c
If one or more of these conditions fail, then f (x) is discontinuous at c.
To illustrate this definition, five functions f (x) are graphed below. Only
the function on the far right is continuous at x = c.

Most familiar functions are continuous at each point x = c in their domain.
For instance, exercises 3 and 4 in the previous section imply that polynomials
and rational functions are continuous at any number c in their domains.
One application of continuity is a limit law for composition.
The

this does not hold without an assumption of continuity.

´
¡

If lim g(x) = L and f is continuous at x = L, then lim f g(x) = f lim g(x) .

Proof. Suppose lim g(x) = L and f is continuous at x = L. We need to show

lim f g(x) = f (L). According to Definition 13.2, for any ε > 0 we must show
x→ c
¯ ¡
¯
¢
there is a corresponding δ > 0 for which 0 < | x − c| < δ implies ¯ f g(x) − L¯ < ε.

So let ε > 0. As f is continuous at L, Definition 13.3 yields lim f (x) = f (L).
From this, we know there is a real number δ0 > 0 for which

x→ L

¯
¯
| x − L| < δ0 implies ¯ f (x) − f (L)¯ < ε.

(A)

But also, from lim g(x) = L, we know that there is a real number δ > 0 for
x→ c

which 0 < | x − c| < δ implies ¯ g(x) − L¯¯ < δ0 . ¯
If 0 < | x − ¯c| < δ, then we have ¯ g(x) − L¯ < δ0 , and from this (A) yields
¯ ¡

¯ f g(x) − f (L)¯ < ε. Thus lim f g(x) = f (L), and the proof is complete.

f 0 (c) = lim

f (x) − f (c)

x−c

provided the limit exists (in which case we say f is differentiable at c).
You may recall that differentiability implies continuity.
Theorem 13.10 If f is differentiable at c, then f is continuous at c.
Proof. Suppose f is differentiable at c, so lim

x→ c

f (x) =

f ( x)− f ( c)
x− c

f (x) − f (c)

For some functions f (x), limits such as lim f (x) and lim f (x) make sense.
x→∞
x→−∞
Consider the function graphed below. As x moves to the right (towards
positive infinity) the corresponding f (x) value approaches 2. We express
this in symbols as lim f (x) = 2. Such a limit is called a limit at infinity,
x→∞
which is a bit of a misnomer because x is never “at” infinity, just moving
toward it.

The graph squeezes in on the dashed horizontal line y = 2 as x moves to ∞.
This line is called a horizontal asymptote of the function f (x). It is not a
part of the graph, but it helps us visualize the behavior of f (x) as x grows.
Also, in this picture, as x moves to the left (toward negative infinity),
the corresponding value f (x) approaches −1. We express this in symbols as
lim f (x) = −1. The horizontal line y = −1 is a second horizontal asymptote
x→−∞
of this function f (x).
In general, lim f (x) = L means that f (x) is arbitrarily close to L, provided
x→∞
that x is sufficiently large (i.e., “provided that x is sufficiently close to ∞”).
In other words, given any ε >¯0, there¯ is a number N > 0 (possibly quite
large) such that x > N implies ¯ f (x) − L¯ < ε. This is illustrated below.

For any x ∈ R, we know that −1 ≤ sin(x) ≤ 1. Consequently we would expect

Of course, not every limit at infinity will exist. Consider lim x2 . As x

goes to infinity, the quantity x2 approaches infinity too. Common sense says
the limit does not exist because x2 eventually exceeds any finite number L.
But it’s good practice to prove this common-sensical statement.
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that lim x2 = L for some L ∈ R. Let

13.7 Sequences
Our final two sections treat sequences and series, topics usually covered in
a second semester of calculus.
Recall that a sequence is an infinitely long list of real numbers
a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 , . . .

The number a 1 is called the first term, a 2 is the second term, a 3 is the third
term, and so on. For example, the sequence
2,

3 4
5
6
7
4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , 36 ,

...

n+1
.
n2

has nth term a n =
The nth term is sometimes called the general term.
We can define a sequence by giving a formula for its general term. The
n+1
sequence with general term a n = (−1) n (n+1) is
− 75 , · · · .
© ª
We denote a sequence with nth term a n as a n . For example, the three
©
©
ª
sequences displayed above are denoted compactly as a n } and nn+21 and
n
o
©
ª
(−1)n+1 ( n+1)
, respectively. In this manner, the sequence n2 + 1 is
n

2, − 32 ,

4
3,

− 54 ,

6
5,

2, 5, 10, 17, 26, 37, · · · .

Sometimes we define a sequence by writing down its first several terms,
with the agreement that the general term is implied by the number pattern.
For instance, the sequence
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, · · ·
2

is understood to be n because n2 is the most obvious formula that matches
the first six terms. But be alert to the fact that a finite number of terms can
never completely and unambiguously specify an infinite sequence. For all
we know, the nth term of 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . . might not be a n = n2 , but actually
a n = n2 + (n − 1)(n − 2)(n − 3)(n − 4)(n − 5). This agrees with the first five listed
terms, but the sixth term is a 6 = 156, not the expected a 6 = 36.
©
A sequence a n } can be regarded as a function f : N → R, where f (n) = a n .
©
ª
For example, the sequence 1 − n1 is the function f (n) = 1 − n1 . In this sense
we can graph a sequence; but the graph looks like a string of beads rather
©
ª
than a curve, because the domain is N, not R. Here is the graph of 1 − n1 .

Roughly speaking, we say a sequence a n } converges to a number L if
the numbers a n get closer and closer to L as n gets bigger and bigger.
©
ª
For example, the sequence 1 − n1 from the previous page converges to
L = 1, because as n gets big, the number 1 − n1 approaches 1.
In general, proving facts about convergence requires a precise definition.
For this, we can adapt the definition of a limit at infinity from Section 13.6.
© ª
The sequence a n converges to L if a n can be made arbitrarily close to L by
choosing n sufficiently large. Here is the exact definition.
©

that for any ε > 0 there is an N ∈ N for which n > N implies a n − L¯ < ε.

If a n converges to L, we denote this state of affairs as lim a n = L.
n→∞

If a n does not converge to any number L, then we say it diverges.
Definition 13.5 is illustrated below. For any ε > 0 (no matter how small),
there is an integer N for which the terms a n of the sequence lie between
L − ε and L + ε provided n > N . Smaller values of ε require larger values of N .
But no matter how small ε is, there is a (possibly quite large) number N for
which a n is within ε units from L when n > N .

For our first example, let’s return to the sequence 1 − n1 , which is
graphed on the previous page (page 261). Notice that as n gets large, n1
approaches 0, and 1 − n1 approaches 1. So we can see that the sequence
converges to 1. But let’s prove this, in order to illustrate Definition 13.5.

The first few terms of this sequence are 2, − 32 , 43 , − 54 , 65 , − 76 , · · · . The terms
alternate between positive and negative, with the odd terms positive and
the even terms negative. Here is a graph of the sequence.

The picture suggests that as n increases, the terms bounce back and forth
between values that are alternately close to 1 and −1. This is also evident by
n+1
inspection of the general term a n = (−1) n (n+1) , because n+n 1 approaches 1 as
n grows toward infinity, while the power of −1 alternates the sign. Because
the general term does not approach any single number, it appears that this
sequence diverges. Now let’s set out to prove this. Our proof formalizes the
idea that if the sequence did converge to a number L, then L would have to
be within ε units of both −1 and 1, and this is impossible if ε < 1.
n+1

Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the sequence (−1) n (n+1)
converges to a real number
L. Let ε = 1. By Definition 13.5 there is an N ∈ N
¯ (−1)n+1 (n+1)

If n is odd, then the nth term of the sequence is a n = (−1) n (n+1) = n+n 1 > 1.

For n even, the nth term of the sequence is is a n = (−1) n (n+1) = − n+n 1 < −1.
Take an odd number m > N and an even number n > N . The above three

¯

(because ¯a n − L¯ < 1 when n > N )

Thus 2 < 2, which is a contradiction. Consequently the series diverges.

For another example of a sequence that diverges, consider 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . .
whose nth term is a n = n2 . Clearly this diverges, because lim n2 = ∞, which
n→∞
is not a number. In such a case we say that the sequence diverges to ∞.

13.8 Series
You may recall from your calculus course that there is a big difference
between a sequence and a series.
A sequence is an infinite list a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , a 5 , a 6 , · · · .
But a series is an infinite sum a 1 + a 2 + a 3 + a 4 + a 5 + a 6 + · · · .
© ª
We use the notation a n to denote the sequence a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , . . ., but we
use sigma notation to denote a series:
∞
X

a k = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 + · · · .

X
2 3 4 5 6 7
= + + + + + + ···
1 2 3 4 5 6
k=1 k

equals ∞ because every fraction in the infinite sum is greater than 1.
Series are significant in calculus because many complex functions can be
expressed as series involving terms built from simple algebraic operations.
For example, your calculus course may have developed the Maclaurin series
for various functions, such as
cos(x) =

But before we make any progress with series, it is essential that we
clearly specify what it means to add up infinitely many numbers. We need
to understand the situations in which this does and does not make sense.
The key to codifying whether or not a series

Moreover, the larger n gets, the closer s n should be to S . In other words,
the sequence s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 , s 5 , . . . of partial sums should converge to S . This
leads to our main definition. We say that an infinite series converges if its
sequence of partial sums converges.

Despite the previous example, in practice definitions 13.7 and 13.5 are
rarely used to prove that a particular sequence or series converges to a
particular number. Instead we tend to use a multitude of convergence tests
that are covered in a typical calculus course. Examples of such tests include
the comparison test, the ratio test, the root test and the alternating series test.
You learned how to use these tests and techniques in your calculus course,
though that course may not have actually proved that the tests were valid.
The point of our present discussion is that definitions 13.7 and 13.5 can be
used to prove the tests. To underscore this point, this section’s exercises
ask you to prove several convergence tests.
By way of illustration, we close with a proof of a theorem that leads to a
test for divergence.

Then by Definition 13.7, the sequence of partial sums s n converges to S .

¯
¯
n > N implies s n − S < ε. Thus also n − 1 > N implies ¯ s n−1 − S ¯ < ε.
© ª

paragraph,
there is an N 0 ∈ N for which n > N 0 implies ¯ s n − S ¯ < 2ε and
¯
¯ ε
¯ s n−1 − S ¯ < . Notice that a n = s n − s n−1 for any n > 2. So if n > N 0 we have

If A = a, b, c, d , then | A | = 4; if B = n ∈ Z : −5 ≤ n ≤ 5 , then |B| = 11. In this
case | A | < |B|. What could be simpler than that?
Actually, the idea of cardinality becomes quite subtle when the sets
are infinite. The main point of this chapter is to explain how there are
numerous different kinds of infinity, and some infinities are bigger than
others. Two sets A and B can both have infinite cardinality, yet | A | < |B|.

14.1 Sets with Equal Cardinalities
We begin with a discussion of what it means for two sets to have the same
cardinality. Up until this point we’ve said | A | = |B| if A and B have the same
number of elements: Count the elements of A , then count the elements of
B. If you get the same number, then | A | = |B|.
Although this is a fine strategy if the sets are finite (and not too big!),
it doesn’t apply to infinite sets because we’d never be done counting their
elements. We need a new approach that applies to both finite and infinite
sets. Here it is:
Definition 14.1 Two sets A and B have the same cardinality, written
| A | = |B|, if there exists a bijective function f : A → B. If no such bijective
f exists, then the sets have unequal cardinalities, written | A | 6= |B|.

The above picture illustrates our definition. There is a bijective function
f : A → B, so | A | = |B|. The function f matches up A with B. Think of f as
describing how to overlay A onto B so that they fit together perfectly.

On the other hand, if A and B are as indicated in either of the following
figures, then there can be no bijection f : A → B. (The best we can do is a
function that is either injective or surjective, but not both.) Therefore the
definition says | A | 6= |B| in these cases.

Example 14.1 The sets A = n ∈ Z : 0 ≤ n ≤ 5 and B = n ∈ Z : −5 ≤ n ≤ 0
have the same cardinality because there is a bijective function f : A → B
given by the rule f (n) = −n.

Several comments are in order. First, if | A | = |B|, there can be lots of
bijective functions from A to B. We only need to find one of them in order to
conclude | A | = |B|. Second, as bijective functions play such a big role here,
we use the word bijection to mean bijective function. Thus the function
f (n) = − n from Example 14.1 is a bijection. Also, an injective function is
called an injection and a surjective function is called a surjection.
We emphasize and reiterate that Definition 14.1 applies to finite as well
as infinite sets. If A and B are infinite, then | A | = |B| provided there exists
a bijection f : A → B. If no such bijection exists, then | A | 6= |B|.
Example 14.2 This example shows that |N| = |Z|. To see why this is true,
notice that the following table describes a bijection f : N → Z.

Notice that f is described in such a way that it is both injective and surjective.
Every integer appears exactly once on the infinitely long second row. Thus,
according to the table, given any b ∈ Z there is some natural number n
with f (n) = b, so f is surjective. It is injective because the way the table
is constructed forces f (m) 6= f (n) whenever m 6= n. Because of this bijection
f : N → Z, we must conclude from Definition 14.1 that |N| = |Z|.
Example 14.2 may seem slightly unsettling. On one hand it makes sense
that |N| = |Z| because N and Z are both infinite, so their cardinalities are
both “infinity.” On the other hand, Z may seem twice as large as N because Z

has all the negative integers as well as the positive ones. Definition 14.1
settles the issue. Because the bijection f : N → Z matches up N with Z, it
follows that |N| = |Z|. We summarize this with a theorem.
Theorem 14.1 There exists a bijection f : N → Z. Therefore |N| = |Z|.
The fact that N and Z have the same cardinality might prompt us to
compare the cardinalities of other infinite sets. How, for example, do N and
R compare? Let’s turn our attention to this.
In fact, |N| 6= |R|. This was first recognized by Georg Cantor (1845–1918),
who devised an ingenious argument to show that there are no surjective
functions f : N → R. (This in turn implies that there can be no bijections
f : N → R, so |N| 6= |R| by Definition 14.1.)
We now describe Cantor’s argument for why there are no surjections
f : N → R. We will reason informally, rather than writing out an exact proof.
Take any arbitrary function f : N → R. Here’s why f can’t be surjective:
Imagine making a table for f , where values of n in N are in the left-hand
column and the corresponding values f (n) are on the right. The first few
entries might look something as follows. In this table, the real numbers f (n)
are written with all their decimal places trailing off to the right. Thus, even
though f (1) happens to be the real number 0.4, we write it as 0.40000000 . . . .,
etc.

There is a diagonal shaded band in the table. For each n ∈ N, this band
covers the n th decimal place of f (n):
The 1st decimal place of f (1) is the 1st entry on the diagonal.
The 2nd decimal place of f (2) is the 2nd entry on the diagonal.
The 3rd decimal place of f (3) is the 3rd entry on the diagonal.
The 4th decimal place of f (4) is the 4th entry on the diagonal, etc.
The diagonal helps us construct a number b ∈ R that is unequal to any f (n).
Just let the nth decimal place of b differ from the nth entry of the diagonal.
Then the nth decimal place of b differs from the nth decimal place of f (n).
In order to be definite, define b to be the positive number less than 1 whose
nth decimal place is 0 if the nth decimal place of f (n) does not equal 0, and
whose nth decimal place is 1 if the nth decimal place of f (n) equals 0. Thus,
for the function f illustrated in the above table, we have
b = 0.01010001001000 . . .

and b has been defined so that, for any n ∈ N, its nth decimal place is unequal
to the nth decimal place of f (n). Therefore f (n) 6= b for every natural number
n, meaning f is not surjective.
Since this argument applies to any function f : N → R (not just the one in
the above example) we conclude that there exist no bijections f : N → R, so
|N| 6= |R| by Definition 14.1. We summarize this as a theorem.
Theorem 14.2 There exists no bijection f : N → R. Therefore |N| 6= |R|.
This is our first indication of how there are different kinds of infinities.
Both N and R are infinite sets, yet |N| 6= |R|. We will continue to develop this
theme throughout this chapter. The next example shows that the intervals
(0, ∞) and (0, 1) on R have the same cardinality.

Example 14.3 Show that |(0, ∞)| = |(0, 1)|.
To accomplish this, we need to show that there is a bijection f : (0, ∞) → (0, 1).
We describe this function geometrically. Consider the interval (0, ∞) as the
positive x-axis of R2 . Let the interval (0, 1) be on the y-axis as illustrated in
Figure 14.1, so that (0, ∞) and (0, 1) are perpendicular to each other.
The figure also shows a point P = (−1, 1). Define f (x) to be the point on
(0, 1) where the line from P to x ∈ (0, ∞) intersects the y-axis. By similar
triangles, we have

and therefore
f (x) =

x+1

If it is not clear from the figure that f : (0, ∞) → (0, 1) is bijective, then you
can verify it using the techniques from Section 12.2. (Exercise 16, below.)
It is important to note that equality of cardinalities is an equivalence
relation on sets: it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Let us confirm
this. Given a set A , the identity function A → A is a bijection, so | A | = | A |.
(This is the reflexive property.) For the symmetric property, if | A | = |B|, then
there is a bijection f : A → B, and its inverse is a bijection f −1 : B → A , so
|B| = | A |. For transitivity, suppose | A | = |B| and |B| = |C |. Then there are
bijections f : A → B and g : B → C . The composition g ◦ f : A → C is a bijection
(Theorem 12.2), so | A | = |C |.
The transitive property can be useful. If, in trying to show two sets A
and C have the same cardinality, we can produce a third set B for which
| A | = |B| and |B| = |C |, then transitivity assures us that indeed | A | = |C |. The
next example uses this idea.
Example 14.4 Show that |R| = |(0, 1)|.
Because of the bijection g : R → (0, ∞) where g(x) = 2 x , we have |R| = |(0, ∞)|.
Also, Example 14.3 shows that |(0, ∞)| = |(0, 1)|. Therefore |R| = |(0, 1)|.
So far in this chapter we have declared that two sets have “the same
cardinality” if there is a bijection between them. They have “different
cardinalities” if there exists no bijection between them. Using this idea,
we showed that |Z| = |N| 6= |R| = |(0, ∞)| = |(0, 1)|. So, we have a means of
determining when two sets have the same or different cardinalities. But
we have neatly avoided saying exactly what cardinality is. For example, we
can say that |Z| = |N|, but what exactly is |Z|, or |N|? What exactly are these
things that are equal? Certainly not numbers, for they are too big. And

saying they are “infinity” is not accurate, because we now know that there
are different types of infinity. So just what kind of mathematical entity is
|Z|? In general, given a set X , exactly what is its cardinality | X |?
This is a lot like asking what a number is. A number, say 5, is an
abstraction, not a physical thing. Early in life we instinctively grouped
together certain sets of things (five apples, five oranges, etc.) and conceived
of 5 as the thing common to all such sets. In a very real sense, the number
5 is an abstraction of the fact that any two of these sets can be matched
up via a bijection. That is, it can be identified with a certain equivalence
class of sets under the “has the same cardinality as” relation. (Recall that
this is an equivalence relation.) This is easy to grasp because our sense of
numeric quantity is so innate. But in exactly the same way we can say that
the cardinality of a set X is what is common to all sets that can be matched
to X via a bijection. This may be harder to grasp, but it is really no different
from the idea of the magnitude of a (finite) number.
In fact, we could be concrete and define | X | to be the equivalence class of
all sets whose cardinality is the same as that of X . This has the advantage
of giving an explicit meaning to | X |. But there is no harm in taking the
intuitive approach and just interpreting the cardinality | X | of a set X to
be a measure of the “size” of X . The point of this section is that we have a
means of deciding whether two sets have the same size or different sizes.

14.2 Countable and Uncountable Sets
Let’s summarize the main points from the previous section.
1. | A | = |B| if and only if there exists a bijection A → B.
2. |N| = |Z| because there exists a bijection N → Z.
3. |N| 6= |R| because there exists no bijection N → R.
Thus, even though N, Z and R are all infinite sets, their cardinalities
are not all the same. The sets N and Z have the same cardinality, but R’s
cardinality is different from that of both the other sets. This means infinite
sets can have different sizes. We now make some definitions to put words
and symbols to this phenomenon.
In a certain sense you can count the elements of N; you can count its
elements off as 1, 2, 3, 4, . . ., but you’d have to continue this process forever
to count the whole set. Thus we will call N a countably infinite set, and the
same term is used for any set whose cardinality equals that of N.
Definition 14.2 Suppose A is a set. Then A is countably infinite if
|N| = | A |, that is, if there exists a bijection N → A . The set A is countable
if it is finite or countably infinite. The set A is uncountable if it is infinite
and |N| 6= | A |, that is, if A is infinite and there is no bijection N → A .
Thus Z is countably infinite but R is uncountable. This section deals
mainly with countably infinite sets. Uncountable sets are treated later.
If A is countably infinite, then |N| = | A |, so there is a bijection f : N → A .
Think of f as “counting” the elements of A . The first element of A is f (1),
followed by f (2), then f (3) and so on. It makes sense to think of a countably
infinite set as the smallest type of infinite set, because if the counting
process stopped, the set would be finite, not infinite; a countably infinite set
has the fewest elements that a set can have and still be infinite. We reserve
the special symbol ℵ0 to stand for the cardinality of countably infinite sets.
Definition 14.3 The cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted
as ℵ0 . That is, |N| = ℵ0 . Thus any countably infinite set has cardinality ℵ0 .
(The symbol ℵ is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and is pronounced
“aleph.” The symbol ℵ0 is pronounced “aleph naught.”) The summary of
facts at the beginning of this section shows |Z| = ℵ0 and |R| 6= ℵ0 .
Example 14.5 Let E = 2k : k ∈ Z be the set of even integers. The function
f : Z → E defined as f (n) = 2n is easily seen to be a bijection, so we have
|Z| = |E |. Thus, as |N| = |Z| = |E |, the set E is countably infinite and |E | = ℵ0 .

Here is a significant fact: The elements of any countably infinite set A
can be written in an infinitely long list a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , . . . that begins with some
element a 1 ∈ A and includes every element of A . For example, the set E in
the above example can be written in list form as 0, 2, −2, 4, −4, 6, −6, 8, −8, . . .
The reason that this can be done is as follows. Since A is countably infinite,
Definition 14.2 says there is a bijection f : N → A . This allows us to list out
the set A as an infinite list f (1), f (2), f (3), f (4), . . . Conversely, if the elements
of A can be written in list form as a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . ., then the function f : N → A
defined as f (n) = a n is a bijection, so A is countably infinite. We summarize
this as follows.
Theorem 14.3 A set A is countably infinite if and only if its elements can
be arranged in an infinite list a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , . . .
As an example of how this theorem might be used, let P denote the set
of all prime numbers. Since we can list its elements as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, . . ., it
follows that the set P is countably infinite.
As another consequence of Theorem 14.3, note that we can interpret the
fact that the set R is not countably infinite as meaning that it is impossible
to write out all the elements of R in an infinite list. (After all, we tried to do
that in the table on page 271, and failed!)
This raises a question. Is it also impossible to write out all the elements
of Q in an infinite list? In other words, is the set Q of rational numbers
countably infinite or uncountable? If you start plotting the rational numbers
on the number line, they seem to mostly fill up R. Sure, some numbers
p
such as 2, π and e will not be plotted, but the dots representing rational
numbers seem to predominate. We might thus expect Q to be uncountable.
However, it is a surprising fact that Q is countable. The proof presented
below arranges all the rational numbers in an infinitely long list.
Theorem 14.4 The set Q of rational numbers is countably infinite.
Proof. To prove this, we just need to show how to write the set Q in list
form. Begin by arranging all rational numbers in an infinite array. This is
done by making the following chart. The top row has a list of all integers,
beginning with 0, then alternating signs as they increase. Each column
headed by an integer k contains all the fractions (in reduced form) with
numerator k. For example, the column headed by 2 contains the fractions
2 2 2 2
2 2 2
1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , . . ., and so on. It does not contain 2 , 4 , 6 , etc., because those are
not reduced, and in fact their reduced forms appear in the column headed
by 1. You should examine this table and convince yourself that it contains
all rational numbers in Q.

By Theorem 14.3, it follows that Q is countably infinite, that is, |Q| = |N|. ■
It is also true that the Cartesian product of two countably infinite sets
is itself countably infinite, as our next theorem states.
Theorem 14.5 If A and B are both countably infinite, then so is A × B.
Proof. Suppose A and B are both countably infinite. By Theorem 14.3, we
know we can write A and B in list form as

As an example of a consequence of this theorem, notice that since Q is
countably infinite, the set Q × Q is also countably infinite.
Recall that the word “corollary” means a result that follows easily from
some other result. We have the following corollary of Theorem 14.5.
Corollary 14.1 Given n countably infinite sets A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n , with n ≥ 2,
the Cartesian product A 1 × A 2 × · · · × A n is also countably infinite.
Proof. The proof is by induction on n. For the basis step, notice that when
n = 2 the statement asserts that for countably infinite sets A 1 and A 2 , the
product A 1 × A 2 is countably infinite, and this is true by Theorem 14.5.
Assume that for some k ≥ 2, any product A 1 × A 2 × · · · × A k of countably
infinite sets is countably infinite. Consider a product A 1 × A 2 ×· · ·× A k × A k+1
of k + 1 countably infinite sets. It is easy to confirm that the function
f : A 1 × A 2 × A 3 × · · · × A k × A k+1

−→ (A 1 × A 2 × A 3 × · · · × A k ) × A k+1

is bijective, so ¯ A 1 × A 2 × A 3 × · · · × A k × A k+1 ¯ = ¯(A 1 × A 2 × A 3 × · · · × A k ) × A k+1 ¯.
By the induction hypothesis, (A 1 × A 2 × A 3 × · · · × A k ) × A k+1 is a product of
two countably infinite sets, so it is countably infinite by Theorem 14.5. As
noted above, A 1 × A 2 × A 3 × · · · × A k × A k+1 has the same cardinality as the set
(A 1 × A 2 × A 3 × · · · × A k ) × A k+1 , so it too is countably infinite.
■

Theorem 14.6 If A and B are both countably infinite, then their union
A ∪ B is countably infinite.
Proof. Suppose A and B are both countably infinite. By Theorem 14.3, we
know we can write A and B in list form as

(We agree not to list an element twice if it belongs to both A and B.) Thus

14.3 Comparing Cardinalities
At this point we know that there are at least two different kinds of infinity.
On one hand, there are countably infinite sets such as N, of cardinality ℵ0 .
Then there is the uncountable set R. Are there other kinds of infinity
beyond these two kinds? The answer is “yes,” but to see why we first need
to introduce some new definitions and theorems.
Our first task will be to formulate a definition of what we mean by
| A | < |B|. Of course if A and B are finite we know exactly what this means:
| A | < |B| means that when the elements of A and B are counted, A is found
to have fewer elements than B. But this process breaks down if A or B is
infinite, for then the elements can’t be counted.
The language of functions helps us overcome this difficulty. Notice that
for finite sets A and B it is intuitively clear that | A | < |B| if and only if
there exists an injective function f : A → B but there is no bijective function
f : A → B. The following diagram illustrates this:

We will use this idea to define what is meant by | A | < |B| and | A | ≤ |B|. For
emphasis, the following definition also restates what is meant by | A | = |B|.
Definition 14.4 Suppose A and B are sets.
1. | A | = |B| means there is a bijection A → B.
2. | A | < |B| means there is an injection A → B, but no bijection A → B.
3. | A | ≤ |B| means there is an injection A → B.
For example, consider N and R. The function f : N → R defined as f (n) = n
is clearly injective, but it is not surjective because given the element 12 ∈ R,
we have f (n) 6= 21 for every n ∈ N. In fact, Theorem 14.2 of Section 14.1
asserts that there is no surjection N → R, and hence no bijections either.
Definition 14.4 yields
|N| < |R|.
(14.1)
Said differently, ℵ0 < |R|.
Is there a set X for which |R| < | X |? The answer is “yes.” The next
theorem implies |R| < |P (R)|. (Recall that P (A) denotes the power set of A .)
Theorem 14.7 If A is any set, then | A | < |P (A)|.
Proof. Before beginning the proof, we remark that this statement is obvious
if A is finite, for then | A | < 2| A | = |P (A)|. But our proof must apply to all
sets A , both finite and infinite, so it must use Definition 14.4.
We prove the theorem with direct proof. Let A be an arbitrary set.
According to Definition 14.4, to prove | A | < |P (A)| we must show that there
is an injection f : A → P (A), but no bijection f : A → P (A).
To see that there is an injection f : A → P (A), define f by the rule
© ª
f (x) = x . In words, f sends any element x of A to the one-element set
© ª
x ∈ P (A). Then f : A → P (A) is injective, as follows. Suppose f (x) = f (y).
© ª © ª
© ª
© ª
Then x = y . Now, the only way that x and y can be equal is if x = y,
so it follows that x = y. Thus f is injective.
Next we need to show that there exists no bijection A → P (A). We
will verify this by proving that there is no surjection A → P (A). Take an

arbitrary function f : A → P (A). To show f is not surjective we will produce
a set B ∈ P (A) for which f (a) 6= B for all a ∈ A . Notice that for any element
x ∈ A , we have f (x) ∈ P (A), that is, f (x) ⊆ A . Thus f is a function sending
elements of A to subsets of A . It follows that for any x ∈ A , either x ∈ f (x) or
x ∉ f (x). Using this idea, define the following element B ∈ P (A):
©
ª
B = x ∈ A : x ∉ f (x) ⊆ A.

Take an arbitrary a ∈ A . The following two cases show that f (a) 6= B.
Case 1. If a ∉ f (a), then the definition of B implies a ∈ B. Consequently,
f (a) = B is impossible, for it would mean a ∉ B and a ∈ B.
Case 2. If a ∈ f (a), then the definition of B implies a ∉ B. Consequently,
f (a) = B is impossible, for it would mean a ∈ B and a ∉ B.
So f (a) 6= B for all a ∈ A , and hence f is not surjective. As this holds for
any function f : A → P (A), there are no surjective functions f : A → P (A).
Consequently there are no such bijections either.
In conclusion, we have seen that there exists an injection A → P (A) but
no bijection A → P (A), so Definition 14.4 implies that | A | < |P (A)|.
■
Beginning with the set A = N and applying Theorem 14.7 over and over
again, we get the following chain of infinite cardinalities.
ℵ0 = |N| < |P (N)| < |P (P (N))| < |P (P (P (N)))| < · · ·

(14.2)

Thus there is an infinite sequence of different types of infinity, starting with
ℵ0 and becoming ever larger. The set N is countable, and all the sets P (N),
P (P (N)), etc., are uncountable.
In the next section we will prove that |P (N)| = |R|. Thus |N| and |R| are
the first two entries in the chain (14.2) above. They are just two relatively
tame infinities in a long list of other wild and exotic infinities.
Unless you plan on studying advanced set theory or the foundations of
mathematics, you are unlikely to ever encounter any types of infinity beyond
ℵ0 and |R|. Still you will in future mathematics courses need to distinguish
between countably infinite and uncountable sets, so we close with two final
theorems that can help you do this.
Theorem 14.8 An infinite subset of a countably infinite set is countably
infinite.
Proof. Suppose A is an infinite subset of the countably infinite set B. As B
is countably infinite, its elements can be written in a list b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , . . .

Richard Hammack

Comparing Cardinalities

283

Then we can also write A ’s elements in list form by proceeding through
the elements of B, in order, and selecting those that belong to A . Thus A
can be written in list form, and since A is infinite, its list will be infinite.
Consequently A is countably infinite.
■
Theorem 14.9 If U ⊆ A , and U is uncountable, then A is uncountable.
Proof. For the sake of contradiction say that U ⊆ A , and U is uncountable
but A is not uncountable. Then since U ⊆ A and U is infinite, then A must
be infinite too. Since A is infinite, and not uncountable, it must be countably
infinite. Then U is an infinite subset of a countably infinite set A , so U
is countably infinite by Theorem 14.8. Thus U is both uncountable and
countably infinite, a contradiction.
■
Theorems 14.8 and 14.9 can be useful when we need to decide whether a
set is countably infinite or uncountable. They sometimes allow us to decide
its cardinality by comparing it to a set whose cardinality is known.
For example, suppose we want to decide whether or not the set A = R2 is
©
ª
uncountable. Since the x-axis U = (x, 0) : x ∈ R ⊆ R2 has the same cardinality
as R, it is uncountable. Theorem 14.9 implies that R2 is uncountable. Other
examples can be found in the exercises.

14.4 The Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder Theorem

An often used property of numbers is that if a ≤ b and b ≤ a, then a = b. It
is reasonable to ask if the same property applies to cardinality. If | A | ≤ |B|
and |B| ≤ | A |, is it true that | A | = |B|? This is in fact true, and this section’s
goal is to prove it. This will yield an alternate (and highly effective) method
of proving that two sets have the same cardinality.
Recall (Definition 14.4) that | A | ≤ |B| means that there is an injection
f : A → B. Likewise, |B| ≤ | A | implies that there is an injection g : B → A .
Our aim is to show that if | A | ≤ |B| and |B| ≤ | A |, then | A | = |B|. In
other words, we aim to show that if there are injections f : A → B and
g : B → A , then there is a bijection h : A → B. The proof of this fact, though
not particularly difficult, is not entirely trivial, either. The fact that f and
g guarantee that such an h exists is called the the Cantor-BernsteinSchröder theorem. This theorem is very useful for proving two sets A
and B have the same cardinality: it says that instead of finding a bijection
A → B, it suffices to find injections A → B and B → A . This is useful because
injections are often easier to find than bijections.
We will prove the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem, but before doing
so let’s work through an informal visual argument that will guide us through
(and illustrate) the proof.
Suppose there are injections f : A → B and g : B → A . We want to use
them to produce a bijection h : A → B. Sets A and B are sketched below.
For clarity, each has the shape of the letter that denotes it, and to help
distinguish them the set A is shaded.

Think of f as putting a “copy” f (A) = f (x) : x ∈ A of A into B, as illustrated.
This copy, the range of f , does not fill up all of B (unless f happens to be
surjective). Likewise, g puts a “copy” g(B) of B into A . Because they are not
necessarily bijective, neither f nor g is guaranteed to have an inverse. But
the map g : B → g(B) from B to g(B) = { g(x) : x ∈ B} is bijective, so there is an
inverse g−1 : g(B) → B. (We will need this inverse soon.)

Let’s analyze our infinite sequence B → A → B → A → B → A → · · ·

(g ◦ f ) ◦ (g ◦ f ) ◦ (g ◦ f ), and so on. Let’s also agree that (g ◦ f )0 = ι A , that is, it

Figure 14.6 suggests our desired bijection h : A → B. The injection f
sends the gray areas on the left bijectively to the gray areas on the right.
The injection g−1 : g(B) → B sends the white areas on the left bijectively to
the white areas on the right. We can thus define h : A → B so that h(x) = f (x)

This informal argument suggests that given injections f : A → B and
g : B → A , there is a bijection h : A → B. But it is not a proof. We now present
this as a theorem and tighten up our reasoning in a careful proof, with the
above diagrams and ideas as a guide.
Theorem 14.10 (The Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder Theorem)
If | A | ≤ |B| and |B| ≤ | A |, then | A | = |B|. In other words, if there are injections
f : A → B and g : B → A , then there is a bijection h : A → B.
Proof. (Direct) Suppose there are injections f : A → B and g : B → A . Then,
in particular, g : B → g(B) is a bijection from B onto the range of g, so it
has an inverse g−1 : g(B) → B. (Note that g : B → A itself has no inverse

Let W = A − G , so A = G ∪ W is partitioned into two sets G (think gray) and
W (think white). Define a function h : A → B as
(
f (x)
if x ∈ G
h(x) =
−1
g (x) if x ∈ W.
Notice that this makes sense: if x ∈ W , then x ∉ G , so x ∉ A − g(B) ⊆ G , hence
x ∈ g(B), so g−1 (x) is defined.
To finish the proof, we must show that h is both injective and surjective.
For injective, we assume h(x) = h(y), and deduce x = y. There are three
cases to consider. First, if x and y are both in G , then h(x) = h(y) means
f (x) = f (y), so x = y because f is injective. Second, if x and y are both in W ,
then h(x) = h(y) means g−1 (x) = g−1 (y), and applying g to both sides gives
x = y. In the third case, one of x and y is in G and the other is in W . Say
x ∈ G and y ∈ W . The definition of G gives x = (g ◦ f )k (z) for some k ≥ 0 and
z ∈ A − g(B). Note h(x) = h(y) now implies f (x) = g−1 (y), that is, f ((g ◦ f )k (z)) =
g−1 (y). Applying g to both sides gives (g ◦ f )k+1 (z) = y, which means y ∈ G .
But this is impossible, as y ∈ W . Thus this third case cannot happen. But in
the first two cases h(x) = h(y) implies x = y, so h is injective.
To see that h is surjective, take any b ∈ B. We will find an x ∈ A with
h(x) = b. Note that g(b) ∈ A , so either g(b) ∈ W or g(b) ∈ G . In the first case,
h(g(b)) = g−1 (g(b)) = b, so we have an x = g(b) ∈ A for which h(x) = b. In the
second case, g(b) ∈ G . The definition of G shows
g(b) = (g ◦ f )k (z)

for some z ∈ A − g(B) and k ≥ 0. In fact we have k > 0, because k = 0 would
give g(b) = (g ◦ f )0 (z) = z ∈ A − g(B), but clearly g(b) ∉ A − g(B). Thus
g(b) = (g ◦ f ) ◦ (g ◦ f )k−1 (z)
³ ¡
¢´
= g f (g ◦ f )k−1 (z) .

Because g is injective, this implies
¡
¢
b = f (g ◦ f )k−1 (z) .

Let x = (g ◦ f )k−1 (z), so x ∈ G by definition of G . Observe that h(x) = f (x) =
¡
¢
f (g ◦ f )k−1 (z) = b. We have now seen that for any b ∈ B, there is an x ∈ A for
which h(x) = b. Thus h is surjective.
Since h : A → B is both injective and surjective, it is also bijective.

Here are some examples illustrating how the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder
theorem can be used. This includes a proof that |R| = |P (N)|.
Example 14.6

The intervals [0, 1) and (0, 1) in R have equal cardinalities.

Surely this fact is plausible, for the two intervals are identical except for
the endpoint 0. Yet concocting a bijection [0, 1) → (0, 1) is tricky. (Though not
particularly difficult: see the solution of Exercise 11 of Section 14.1.)
For a simpler approach, note that f (x) = 41 + 12 x is an injection [0, 1) → (0, 1).
Also, g(x) = x is an injection (0, 1) → [0, 1). The Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder
theorem guarantees a bijection h : [0, 1) → (0, 1), so |[0, 1)| = |(0, 1)|.
Theorem 14.11

The sets R and P (N) have the same cardinality.

Proof. Example 14.4 shows that |R| = |(0, 1)|, and Example 14.6 shows |(0, 1)| =
|[0, 1)|. Thus |R| = |[0, 1)|, so to prove the theorem we just need to show that
|[0, 1)| = |P (N)|. By the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem, it suffices to
find injections f : [0, 1) → P (N) and g : P (N) → [0, 1).
To define f : [0, 1) → P (N), we use the fact that any number in [0, 1) has
a unique decimal representation 0.b1 b2 b3 b4 . . ., where each b i one of the
digits 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9, and there is not a repeating sequence of 9’s at the end.
(Recall that, e.g., 0.359999 = 0.360, etc.) Define f : [0, 1) → P (N) as

0, 500 . Also f (0.5) = f (0.50) = 0, 50 . To see that f is injective, take two
unequal numbers 0.b1 b2 b3 b4 . . . and 0.d1 d2 d3 d4 . . . in [0, 1). Then b i 6= d i
for some index i . Now, either b i 6= 0 or d i 6= 0; without loss of generality
say b i 6= 0. Then b i 10 i ∈ f (0.b1 b2 b3 b4 . . .) but b i 10 i ∉ f (0.d1 d2 d3 d4 . . .), so
f (0.b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 . . .) 6= f (0.d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 . . .). Consequently f is injective.
Next, define g : P (N) → [0, 1), where g(X ) = 0.b1 b2 b3 b4 . . . is the number

for which b i = 1 if i ∈ X and b i = 0 if i ∉ X . For example, g 1, 3 = 0.101000,

ª¢
and g 2, 4, 6, 8, . . . = 0.01010101. Also g(;) = 0 and g(N) = 0.1111. To see
that g is injective, suppose X 6= Y . Then there is at least one integer i
that belongs to one of X or Y , but not the other. Consequently g(X ) 6= g(Y )
because they differ in the i th decimal place. This shows g is injective.
From the injections f : [0, 1) → P (N) and g : P (N) → [0, 1), the CantorBernstein-Schröder theorem guarantees a bijection h : [0, 1) → P (N). Hence
|[0, 1)| = |P (N)|. As |R| = |[0, 1)|, we conclude |R| = |P (N)|.

The Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder Theorem

289

We know that |R| 6= |N|. But we just proved |R| = |P (N)|. This suggests
that the cardinality of R is not “too far” from |N| = ℵ0 . We close with a few
informal remarks on this mysterious relationship between ℵ0 and |R|.
We established earlier in this chapter that ℵ0 < |R|. For nearly a century after Cantor formulated his theories on infinite sets, mathematicians
struggled with the question of whether or not there exists a set A for which
ℵ0 < | A | < |R|.

ℵ0

|R|

=

=

It was commonly suspected that no such set exists, but no one was able to
prove or disprove this. The assertion that no such A exists came to be called
the continuum hypothesis.
Theorem 14.11 states that |R| = |P (N)|. Placing this in the context of the
chain (14.2) on page 282, we have the following relationships.

|N| < |P (N)| < |P (P (N))| < |P (P (P (N)))| < · · ·

From this, we can see that the continuum hypothesis asserts that no set
has a cardinality between that of N and its power set.
Though this may seem intuitively plausible, it eluded proof since Cantor
first posed it in the 1880s. In fact, the real state of affairs seems almost
paradoxical. In 1931, the logician Kurt Gödel proved that for any sufficiently
strong and consistent axiomatic system, there exist statements which can
neither be proved nor disproved within the system.
Later he proved that the negation of the continuum hypothesis cannot be
proved within the standard axioms of set theory (i.e., the Zermelo-Fraenkel
axioms, mentioned in Section 1.10). This meant that either the continuum
hypothesis is false and cannot be proven false, or it is true.
In 1964, Paul Cohen discovered another startling truth: Given the laws
of logic and the axioms of set theory, no proof can deduce the continuum
hypothesis. In essence he proved that the continuum hypothesis cannot be
proved.
Taken together, Gödel and Cohens’ results mean that the standard
axioms of mathematics cannot “decide” whether the continuum hypothesis
is true or false, and that no logical conflict can arise from either asserting
or denying the continuum hypothesis. We are free to either accept it as
true or accept it as false, and the two choices lead to different—but equally
consistent—versions of set theory.

Cardinality of Sets

On the face of it, this seems to undermine the foundation of logic, and
everything we have done in this book. The continuum hypothesis should be
a statement—it should be either true or false. How could it be both?
Here is an analogy that may help make sense of this. Consider the
number systems Zn . What if we asked whether [2] = [0] is true or false? Of
course the answer depends on n. The expression [2] = [0] is true in Z2 and
false in Z3 . Moreover, if we assert that [2] = [0] is true, we are logically forced
to the conclusion that this is taking place in the system Z2 . If we assert
that [2] = [0] is false, then we are dealing with some other Zn . The fact that
[2] = [0] can be either true or false does not necessarily mean that there
is some inherent inconsistency within the individual number systems Zn .
The equation [2] = [0] is a true statement in the “universe” of Z2 and a false
statement in the universe of (say) Z3 .
It is the same with the continuum hypothesis. Saying it’s true leads to
one system of set theory. Saying it’s false leads to some other system of set
theory. Gödel and Cohens’ discoveries mean that these two types of set
theory, although different, are equally consistent and valid mathematical
universes.
So what should you believe? Fortunately, it does not make much difference, because most important mathematical results do not hinge on
the continuum hypothesis. (They are true in both universes.) Unless you
undertake a deep study of the foundations of mathematics, you will be fine
accepting the continuum hypothesis as true. Most mathematicians are
agnostics on this issue, but they tend to prefer the version of set theory in
which the continuum hypothesis holds.
The situation with the continuum hypothesis is a testament to the
immense complexity of mathematics. It is a reminder of the importance
of rigor and careful, systematic methods of reasoning that begin with the
ideas introduced in this book.

Conclusion

f you have internalized the ideas in this book, then you have a gained set of
rhetorical tools for deciphering and communicating mathematics. These
tools are indispensable at the advanced levels. But of course it takes more
than mere tools to build something. Creativity, inspiration, skill, talent,
intuition, passion, planning and persistence are also vitally important. It
is safe to say that if you have come this far, then you probably possess a
sufficient measure of these traits.
The quest to understand mathematics has no end, but you are well
equipped for the journey. It is my hope that the things you have learned
from this book will lead you to a higher plane of understanding, creativity
and expression.
Good luck and best wishes.

If you do the drawings carefully, you will find
that your Venn diagrams are the same for both
A ∪ (B ∩ C ) and ( A ∪ B) ∩ ( A ∪ C ). Each looks as
illustrated on the right. Based on this, we are
inclined to say that the equation A ∪ (B ∩ C ) =

7. Suppose sets A and B are in a universal set U . Draw Venn diagrams for A ∩ B

alike. In either case the diagram is the shaded

expect that the equation A ∩ B = A ∪ B is true for
any sets A and B.

7. The derivative of any polynomial of degree 5 is a polynomial of degree 6. (Statement, False)
9. cos( x) = −1
This is not a statement. It is an open sentence because whether it’s true or false
depends on the value of x.
11. The integer x is a multiple of 7.
This is an open sentence, and not a statement.
13. Either x is a multiple of 7, or it is not.
This is a statement, for the sentence is true no matter what x is.
15. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
This is a statement, for it is either definitely true or definitely false. There is
some controversy over whether it’s true or false, but no one claims that it is
neither true nor false.

11. Suppose P is false and that the statement (R ⇒ S ) ⇔ (P ∧ Q ) is true. Find the
truth values of R and S . (This can be done without a truth table.)
Answer: Since P is false, it follows that (P ∧ Q ) is false also. But then in order
for (R ⇒ S ) ⇔ (P ∧ Q ) to be true, it must be that (R ⇒ S ) is false. The only way for
(R ⇒ S ) to be false is if R is true and S is false.

3. ∃ a ∈ R, ∀ x ∈ R, ax = x.
Answer: There exists a real number a for which ax = x for every real number x.
This statement is TRUE. Reason: Consider a = 1.
5. ∀ n ∈ N, ∃ X ∈ P (N), | X | < n
Answer: For every natural number n, there is a subset X of N with | X | < n.
This statement is TRUE. Reason: Suppose n ∈ N. Let X = ;. Then | X | = 0 < n.
7. ∀ X ⊆ N, ∃ n ∈ Z, | X | = n
Answer: For any subset X of N, there exists an integer n for which | X | = n.
This statement is FALSE. For example, the set X = {2, 4, 6, 8, . . .} of all even natural
numbers is infinite, so there does not exist any integer n for which | X | = n.
9. ∀ n ∈ Z, ∃ m ∈ Z, m = n + 5
Answer: For every integer n there is another integer m such that m = n + 5.
This statement is TRUE.

5. For every positive number ε, there is a positive number δ for which | x − a| < δ
implies | f ( x) − f (a)| < ε.
Translation: ∀ ε ∈ R, ε > 0, ∃ δ ∈ R, δ > 0, (| x − a| < δ) ⇒ (| f ( x) − f (a)| < ε)
7. There exists a real number a for which a + x = x for every real number x.
Translation: ∃a ∈ R, ∀ x ∈ R, a + x = x
9. If x is a rational number and x 6= 0, then tan( x) is not a rational number.
Translation: (( x ∈ Q) ∧ ( x 6= 0)) ⇒ (tan( x) ∉ Q)
11. There is a Providence that protects idiots, drunkards, children and the United
States of America.
One translation is as follows. Let R be union of the set of idiots, the set of
drunkards, the set of children, and the set consisting of the USA. Let P be the
open sentence P ( x): x is a Providence. Let S be the open sentence S ( x, y): x
protects y. Then the translation is ∃ x, ∀ y ∈ R, P ( x) ∧ S ( x, y).
(Notice that, although this is mathematically correct, some humor has been lost
in the translation.)

Translation: ∀ x, (∼ M ( x) ∧ S ( x)) ⇒ F ( x),

Section 2.10
Negate the following sentences.
1. The number x is positive, but the number y is not positive.
The “but” can be interpreted as “and.” Using DeMorgan’s law, the negation is:
The number x is not positive or the number y is positive.
3. For every prime number p, there is another prime number q with q > p.
Negation: There is a prime number p such that for every prime number q, q ≤ p.
Also: There exists a prime number p for which q ≤ p for every prime number q.
(etc.)
5. For every positive number ε there is a positive number M for which | f ( x) − b| < ε
whenever x > M .
To negate this, it may be helpful to first write it in symbolic form. The statement
is ∀ε ∈ (0, ∞), ∃ M ∈ (0, ∞), ( x > M ) ⇒ (| f ( x) − b| < ε).
Working out the negation, we have
¡
¢
∼ ∀ε ∈ (0, ∞), ∃ M ∈ (0, ∞), ( x > M ) ⇒ (| f ( x) − b| < ε)
¡
¢
∃ε ∈ (0, ∞), ∼ ∃ M ∈ (0, ∞), ( x > M ) ⇒ (| f ( x) − b| < ε)
¡
¢
∃ε ∈ (0, ∞), ∀ M ∈ (0, ∞), ∼ ( x > M ) ⇒ (| f ( x) − b| < ε) .

=
=

Finally, using the idea from Example 2.15, we can negate the conditional statement that appears here to get
¢
∃ε ∈ (0, ∞), ∀ M ∈ (0, ∞), ∃ x, ( x > M )∧ ∼ (| f ( x) − b| < ε) .

Negation: There exists a positive number ε with the property that for every positive
number M , there is a number x for which x > M and | f ( x) − b| ≥ ε.
7. I don’t eat anything that has a face.
Negation: I will eat some things that have a face.
(Note: If your answer was “I will eat anything that has a face.” then that is
wrong, both morally and mathematically.)
9. If sin( x) < 0, then it is not the case that 0 ≤ x ≤ π.
Negation: There exists a number x for which sin( x) < 0 and 0 ≤ x ≤ π.
11. You can fool all of the people all of the time.
There are several ways to negate this, including:
There is a person that you can’t fool all the time. or
There is a person x and a time y for which x is not fooled at time y.

5. This problems involves 8-digit binary strings such as 10011011 or 00001010. (i.e.,
8-digit numbers composed of 0’s and 1’s.)
(a) How many such strings are there? Answer: 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 256.
(b) How many such strings end in 0? Answer: 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 1 = 128.
(c) How many such strings have the property that their second and fourth digits
are 1’s? Answer: 2 · 1 · 2 · 1 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 64.
(d) How many such strings are such that their second or fourth digits are 1’s?
Solution: These strings can be divided into three types. Type 1 consists of
those strings of form ∗1 ∗ 0 ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗, Type 2 consist of strings of form ∗0 ∗ 1 ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗,
and Type 3 consists of those of form ∗1 ∗ 1 ∗∗∗∗. By the multiplication principle
there are 26 = 64 strings of each type, so there are 3 · 64 = 192 8-digit binary
strings whose second or fourth digits are 1’s.
7. This problem concerns 4-letter codes made from the letters A,B,C,D,...,Z.
(a) How many such codes can be made? Answer: 26 · 26 · 26 · 26 = 456,976
(b) How many such codes have no two consecutive letters the same?
Solution: We use the multiplication principle. There are 26 choices for the first
letter. The second letter can’t be the same as the first letter, so there are only
25 choices for it. The third letter can’t be the same as the second letter, so there
are only 25 choices for it. The fourth letter can’t be the same as the third letter,
so there are only 25 choices for it. Thus there are 26 · 25 · 25 · 25 = 406, 250
codes with no two consecutive letters the same.

Section 3.3
1. Five cards are dealt off of a standard 52-card deck and lined up in a row. How
many such lineups are there that have at least one red card?
Solution: All together there are 52 · 51 · 50 · 49 · 48 = 311875200 possible lineups.
The number of lineups that do not have any red cards (i.e. are made up only
of black cards) is 26 · 25 · 24 · 23 · 22 = 7, 893, 600. By the subtraction principle, the
answer to the question is 311, 875, 200 − 7, 893, 600 = 303, 981, 600.
How many such lineups are there in which the cards are all black or all hearts?
Solution: The number of lineups that are all black is 26 · 25 · 24 · 23 · 22 = 7, 893, 600.
The number of lineups that are hearts (which are red) is 13 · 12 · 11 · 10 · 9 = 154, 440.
By the addition principle, the answer to the question is 7, 893, 600 + 154, 440 =
8, 048, 040.
3. Five cards are dealt off of a standard 52-card deck and lined up in a row. How
many such lineups are there in which all 5 cards are of the same color (i.e., all
black or all red)?
Solution: There are 26 · 25 · 24 · 23 · 22 = 7, 893, 600 possible black-card lineups and
26 · 25 · 24 · 23 · 22 = 7, 893, 600 possible red-card lineups, so by the addition principle
the answer is 7, 893, 600 + 7, 893, 600 = 15, 787, 200.
5. How many integers between 1 and 9999 have no repeated digits?
Solution: Consider the 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit and 4-digit number separately.
The number of 1-digit numbers that have no repeated digits is 9 (i.e., all of
them). The number of 2-digit numbers that have no repeated digits is 9 · 9 = 81.
(The number can’t begin in 0, so there are only 9 choices for its first digit.) The
number of 3-digit numbers that have no repeated digits is 9 · 9 · 8 = 648. The
number of 4-digit numbers that have no repeated digits is 9 · 9 · 8 · 7 = 4536. By
the addition principle, the answer to the question is 9 + 81 + 648 + 4536 = 5274.
How many integers between 1 and 9999 have at least one repeated digit?
Solution: The total number of integers between 1 and 9999 is 9999. Using the
subtraction principle, we can subtract from this the number of digits that have
no repeated digits, which is 5274, as above. Therefore the answer to the question
is 9999 − 5274 = 4725.
7. A password on a certain site must have five characters made from letters of the
alphabet, and there must be at least one upper case letter. How many different
passwords are there?
Solution: Let U be the set of all possible passwords made from a choice of upper
and lower case letters. Let X be the set of all possible passwords made from
lower case letters. Then U − X is the set of passwords that have at least one lower
case letter. By the subtraction principle our answer will be |U − X | = |U | − | X |.
All together, there are 26 + 26 = 52 upper and lower case letters, so by the multiplication principle |U | = 52 · 52 · 52 · 52 · 52 = 525 = 380, 204, 032.
Likewise | X | = 26 · 26 · 26 · 26 · 26 = 265 = 11, 881, 376.
Thus the answer is |U | − | X | = 380, 204, 032 − 11, 881, 376 = 368, 322, 656.

What if there must be a mix of upper and lower case?

Solution: The number of passwords using only upper case letters is 265 =
11, 881, 376, and, as calculated above, this is also the number of passwords that
use only lower case letters. By the addition principe, the number of passwords
that use only lower case or only upper case is 11, 881, 376+11, 881, 376 = 23, 762, 752.
By the subtraction principle, the number of passwords that use a mix of upper
and lower case it the total number of possible passwords minus the number
that use only lower case or only upper case, namely 380, 204, 032 − 23, 762, 752 =
356, 441, 280.
9. This problem concerns lists of length 6 made from the letters A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H.
How many such lists are possible if repetition is not allowed and the list contains
two consecutive vowels?
Solution: There are just two vowels A and E to choose from. The lists we want
to make can be divided into five types. They have one of the forms V V ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗,
or ∗V V ∗ ∗∗, or ∗ ∗ V V ∗ ∗, or ∗ ∗ ∗V V∗, or ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ V V , where V indicates a
vowel and ∗ indicates a consonant. By the multiplication principle, there are
2 · 1 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 = 720 lists of form V V ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗. In fact, that for the same reason there
are 720 lists of each form. Thus by the addition principle, the answer to the
question is 720 + 720 + 720 + 720 + 720 = 3600
11. How many integers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 5? How many are not?
Solution: The integers that are divisible by 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, . . . , 995, 1000. There
are 1000/5 = 200 such numbers. By the subtraction principle, the number that
are not divisible by 5 is 1000 − 200 = 800.

Solution: Regard ABC as a single symbol ABC . Then we are looking for the
number of permutations of the five symbols ABC , D, E, F, G. The number of
such permutations is 5! = 120.
11. You deal 7 cards off of a 52-card deck and line them up in a row. How many

Solution: All together, there are P (52, 7) 7-card lineups with cards selected from
the entire deck. And there are P (26, 7) 7-card lineups with red cards selected
from the 26 red cards in the deck. By the subtraction principle, the number of
lineups that are not all red is P (52, 7) − P (26, 7) = 670,958,870,400.

There are 62 = 15 ways of doing this. For each of these 15 choices there are

1. At a certain university 523 of the seniors are history majors or math majors (or
both). There are 100 senior math majors, and 33 seniors are majoring in both
history and math. How many seniors are majoring in history?
Solution: Let A be the set of senior math majors and B be the set of senior
history majors. From | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B| we get 523 = 100 + |B| − 33, so
|B| = 523 + 33 − 100 = 456. There are 456 history majors.
3. How many 4-digit positive integers are there that are even or contain no 0’s?
Solution: Let A be the set of 4-digit even positive integers, and let B be the set of
4-digit positive integers that contain no 0’s. We seek | A ∪ B|. By the multiplication
principle | A | = 9 · 10 · 10 · 5 = 4500. (Note the first digit cannot be 0 and the last
digit must be even.) Also |B| = 9 · 9 · 9 · 9 = 6561. Further, A ∩ B consists of all even
4-digit integers that have no 0’s. It follows that | A ∩ B| = 9 · 9 · 9 · 4 = 2916. Then the
answer to our question is | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B| = 4500 + 6561 − 2916 = 8145.

Then the answer to our question is | A ∪ B ∪ C |. Using Equation (3.5) to compute
this number,
we have
| A ∪ B ∪ C | = | A |+|B|+|C |−| A ∩ B|−| A ∩ C |−|B ∩ C |+| A ∩ B ∩ C | =

9. A 4-letter list is made from the letters L,I,S,T,E,D according to the following
rule: Repetition is allowed, and the first two letters on the list are vowels or the
list ends in D . How many such lists are possible?
Solution: Let A be the set of such lists for which the first two letters are vowels, so
| A | = 2·2·6·6 = 144. Let B be the set of such lists that end in D , so |B| = 6·6·6·1 = 216.
Then A ∩ B is the set of such lists for which the first two entries are vowels and
the list ends in D . Thus | A ∩ B| = 2 · 2 · 6 · 1 = 24. The answer to our question is
| A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B| = 144 + 216 − 24 = 336.

11. How many 7-digit numbers are even or have exactly three digits equal to 0?
Solution: Let A be the set of 7-digit numbers that are even. By the multiplication
principle, | A | = 9 · 10 · 10 · 10 · 10 · 10 · 5 = 4, 500, 000. Let B be the
set of 7-digit numbers
¡ ¢
that have exactly three digits equal to 0. Then |B| = 9 · 63 · 9 · 9 · 9. (First digit is
anything but 0. Then choose 3 of 6 of the remaining places in the number for
the 0’s. Finally the remaining 3 places can be anything but 0.)
Note A ∩ B is the set of 7-digit numbers that are even and contain exactly three
0’s. We can compute | A ∩ B| with the addition principle, by dividing A ∩ B into
two parts: the even 7-digit numbers with three digits 0 and the last digit is not
0, and the even ¡7-digit
numbers with three digits 0 and the¡ last
digit is 0. The
¢
¢
first part has 9 · 53 · 9 · 9 · 4 elements. The second part has 9 · 52 · 9 · 9 · 9 · 1 elements.
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
Thus | A ∩ B| = 9 · 53 · 9 · 9 · 4 + 9 · 52 · 9 · 9 · 9.
By the inclusion-exclusion ¡formula,
the answer
to our question is | A ∪ B| = | A | +
¢
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
|B| − | A ∩ B| = 4, 500, 000 + 94 63 − 93 53 · 4 − 94 52 = 4, 536, 450.
13. How many 8-digit binary strings end in 1 or have exactly four 1’s?
Solution: Let A be the set of strings that end in 1. By the multiplication principle
¡ ¢
| A | = 27 . Let B be the number of strings with exactly four 1’s. Then |B| = 84
because we can make such a string by choosing 4 of 8 spots for the 1’s and
filling the remaining spots with 0’s. Then A ∩ B is the¡ ¢set of strings that end
with 1 and have exactly four 1’s. Note that | A ∩ B| = 74 (make the last entry
a 1 and choose 3 of the remaining 7 spots for 1’s). By the inclusion-exclusion
formula, the number 8-digit binary
strings that end in 1 or have exactly four 1’s
¡ ¢ ¡ ¢
is | A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B| = 27 + 84 − 73 = 163.
15. How many 10-digit binary strings begin in 1 or end in 1?
Solution: Let A be the set of strings that begin with 1. By the multiplication
principle | A | = 29 . Let B be the number of strings that end with 1. By the
multiplication principle |B| = 29 . Then A ∩ B is the set of strings that begin
and end with 1. By the multiplication principle | A ∩ B| = 28 . By the inclusionexclusion formula, the number 10-digit binary strings begin in 1 or end in 1 is
| A ∪ B| = | A | + |B| − | A ∩ B| = 29 + 29 − 28 = 768.

where there are 15 stars and two bars. Therefore there are 17
15 outcomes without
the white ball. Next we count the outcomes that do have the white ball. Then
there are 14 remaining balls in the grab. In counting the ways that they can
be selected we can use the same stars-and-bars model
above, but this time the

list is of length 16 and has 14 stars. There are 16

11. How many integer solutions does the equation w + x + y + z = 100 have if w ≥ 4,

Richard Hammack

Book of Proof

Solution: Imagine a bag containing 100 red balls, 100 blue balls, 100 green balls
and 100 white balls. Each solution of the equation corresponds to an outcome in
selecting 100 balls from the bag, where the selection includes w ≥ 4 red balls,
x ≥ 2 blue balls, y ≥ 0 green balls and z ≥ 0 white balls.
Now let’s consider making such a selection. Pre-select 4 red balls and 2 blue
balls, so 94 balls remain in the bag. Next the remaining 94 balls are selected.
We can calculate the number of ways that this selection can be made with stars
and bars, where there are 94 stars and 3 bars, so the list’s length is 97.

In how many ways can you place 15 identical balls into 20 different boxes if each
box can hold at most one ball?
Solution: Regard each such distribution as a binary string of length 20, where
there is a 1 in the i th position precisely if the i th box contains a ball (and zeros
elsewhere). The answer is the number of permutations of such a string, which
20!
by Fact 3.8 is 15!5!

choose 15 positions out of 20, which is 20

How many numbers between 10,000 and 99,999 contain one or more of the digits

5!
33,348. By Fact 3.8, the number of permutations of this is 3!1!1!
= 20.
By the same reasoning there are 20 numbers that contain three 4’s, one 3, and
one 8, and 20 numbers that contain three 8’s, one 3, and one 4.
Next, consider the numbers that have two 3’s, two 4’s and one 8, like 33,448. By
5!
Fact 3.8, the number of permutations of this is 2!2!1!
= 30.
By the same reasoning there are 30 numbers that contain two 3’s, two 8’s and
one 4, and 30 numbers that contain two 4’s, two 8’s and one 3. This exhausts all
possibilities. By the addition principle the answer is 20 + 20 + 20 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 150.

Section 3.9

1. Show that if 6 integers are chosen at random, at least two will have the same
remainder when divided by 5.
Solution: Pick six integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 , n5 and n6 at random. Imagine five boxes,
labeled Box 0, Box 1, Box 2, Box 3, Box 4. Each of the picked integers has a
remainder when divided by 5, and that remainder is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. For each n i ,
let r i be its remainder when divided by 5. Put n i in Box r i . We have now put six
numbers in five boxes, so by the pigeonhole principle one of the boxes has two or
more of the picked numbers in it. Those two numbers have the same remainder
when divided by 5.
3. What is the fewest number of times you must roll a six-sided dice before you can
be assured that 10 or more of the rolls resulted in the same number?
Solution: Imagine six boxes, labeled 1 through 6. Every time you roll a , put
an object in Box 1. Every time you roll a , put an object in Box 2, etc. After
n rolls, the division principle says that one box contains d n6 e objects, and this
means you rolled the same number d n6 e times. We seek the smallest n for which
d n6 e ≥ 10. This is the smallest n for which n6 > 9, that is n > 9 · 6 = 54. Thus the
answer is n = 55. You need to roll the dice 55 times.
5. Prove that any set of 7 distinct natural numbers contains a pair of numbers
whose sum or difference is divisible by 10.
Solution: Let S = {a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , a 5 , a 6 , a 7 } be any set of 7 natural numbers. Let’s
say that a 1 < a 2 < a 3 < · · · < a 7 . Consider the set
A

=

{a 1 − a 2 , a 1 − a 3 , a 1 − a 4 , a 1 − a 5 , a 1 − a 6 , a 1 − a 7 ,
a1 + a2 , a1 + a3 , a1 + a4 , a1 + a5 , a1 + a6 , a1 + a7 }

Thus | A | = 12. Now imagine 10 boxes numbered 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9. For each number
a 1 ± a i ∈ A , put it in the box whose number is the one’s digit of a 1 ± a i . (For
example, if a 1 ± a i = 4, put it in Box 4. If a 1 ± a i = 8, put it in Box 8, etc.) Now we
have placed the 12 numbers in A into 10 boxes, so the pigeonhole principle says
at least one box contains two elements a 1 ± a i and a 1 ± a j from A . This means
the last digit of a 1 ± a i is the same as the last digit of a 1 ± a j . Thus the last digit
of the difference (a 1 ± a i ) − (a 1 ± a j ) = ±a i ± a j is 0. Hence ±a i ± a j is a sum or
difference of elements of S that is divisible by 10.

Solution: Let S ¡= {0¢, 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, n + 1}, which is a set with n + 2 elements. The

Let’s now count these 3-element subsets in a different way. Any such subset X
can be written as X = { j, k, `}, where 0 ≤ j < k < ` ≤ n + 1. Note that this forces the
middle element k to be in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Given a fixed middle element k,

middle element 1. If k = 2, there are 2(n − 1) sets X with middle element 2. If
k = 3, there are 3( n − 2) sets X with middle element 3. Thus the left-hand side of

|B| = n. We can make any p-element subset of S by choosing k of its elements

B, for any 0 ≤ k ≤ p. There are m

so there are m

Now let’s think of a way to make such an X ⊆ S with | X | = m + 1. We could begin
by selecting a largest element k for X . Now, once we have chosen k, there are

Solution: Consider the problem of counting the number of length- n lists made
from the symbols {a, b, c}, with repetition allowed. There are 3n such lists, so the
right-hand side counts the number of such lists.
On the other hand, given k with 0 ¡≤ ¢k ≤ n, let’s count the lists that have exactly k

2k nk such lists. (First choose k of n list positions

length-n lists made from the symbols {a, b, c}. Thus the right- and left-hand sides
count the same thing, so they are equal.

1. If x is an even integer, then x2 is even.
Proof. Suppose x is even. Thus x = 2a for some a ∈ Z.
Consequently x2 = (2a)2 = 4a2 = 2(2a2 ).
Therefore x2 = 2b, where b is the integer 2a2 .
Thus x2 is even by definition of an even number.

■

3. If a is an odd integer, then a2 + 3a + 5 is odd.
Proof. Suppose a is odd.
Thus a = 2 c + 1 for some integer c, by definition of an odd number.
Then a2 + 3a + 5 = (2 c + 1)2 + 3(2 c + 1) + 5 = 4 c2 + 4 c + 1 + 6 c + 3 + 5 = 4 c2 + 10 c + 9
= 4 c2 + 10 c + 8 + 1 = 2(2 c2 + 5 c + 4) + 1.
This shows a2 + 3a + 5 = 2b + 1, where b = 2 c2 + 5 c + 4 ∈ Z.
Therefore a2 + 3a + 5 is odd.

■

5. Suppose x, y ∈ Z. If x is even, then x y is even.
Proof. Suppose x, y ∈ Z and x is even.
Then x = 2a for some integer a, by definition of an even number.
Thus x y = (2a)( y) = 2(a y).
Therefore x y = 2b where b is the integer a y, so x y is even.

■

7. Suppose a, b ∈ Z. If a | b, then a2 | b2 .
Proof. Suppose a | b.
By definition of divisibility, this means b = ac for some integer c.
Squaring both sides of this equation produces b2 = a2 c2 .
Then b2 = a2 d , where d = c2 ∈ Z.
By definition of divisibility, this means a2 | b2 .

■

9. Suppose a is an integer. If 7 | 4a, then 7 | a.
Proof. Suppose 7 | 4a.
By definition of divisibility, this means 4a = 7 c for some integer c.
Since 4a = 2(2a) it follows that 4a is even, and since 4a = 7 c, we know 7 c is even.
But then c can’t be odd, because that would make 7 c odd, not even.
Thus c is even, so c = 2 d for some integer d .
Now go back to the equation 4a = 7 c and plug in c = 2 d . We get 4a = 14 d .
Dividing both sides by 2 gives 2a = 7d .
Now, since 2a = 7d , it follows that 7d is even, and thus d cannot be odd.
Then d is even, so d = 2 e for some integer e.
Plugging d = 2 e back into 2a = 7d gives 2a = 14 e.
Dividing both sides of 2a = 14 e by 2 produces a = 7 e.
Finally, the equation a = 7 e means that 7 | a, by definition of divisibility.

11. Suppose a, b, c, d ∈ Z. If a | b and c | d , then ac | bd .

Proof. Suppose a | b and c | d .
As a | b, the definition of divisibility means there is an integer x for which b = ax.
As c | d , the definition of divisibility means there is an integer y for which d = c y.
Since b = ax, we can multiply one side of d = c y by b and the other by ax.
This gives bd = axc y, or bd = (ac)( x y).
Since x y ∈ Z, the definition of divisibility applied to bd = (ac)( x y) gives ac | bd . ■
13. Suppose x, y ∈ R. If x2 + 5 y = y2 + 5 x, then x = y or x + y = 5.
Proof. Suppose x2 + 5 y = y2 + 5 x.
Then x2 − y2 = 5 x − 5 y, and factoring gives ( x − y)( x + y) = 5( x − y).
Now consider two cases.
Case 1. If x − y 6= 0 we can divide both sides of ( x − y)( x + y) = 5( x − y) by the non-zero
quantity x − y to get x + y = 5.
Case 2. If x − y = 0, then x = y. (By adding y to both sides.)
Thus x = y or x + y = 5.
■
15. If n ∈ Z, then n2 + 3 n + 4 is even.
Proof. Suppose n ∈ Z. We consider two cases.
Case 1. Suppose n is even. Then n = 2a for some a ∈ Z.
Therefore n2 + 3n + 4 = (2a)2 + 3(2a) + 4 = 4a2 + 6a + 4 = 2(2a2 + 3a + 2).
So n2 + 3n + 4 = 2b where b = 2a2 + 3a + 2 ∈ Z, so n2 + 3n + 4 is even.
Case 2. Suppose n is odd. Then n = 2a + 1 for some a ∈ Z.
Therefore n2 + 3n + 4 = (2a + 1)2 + 3(2a + 1) + 4 = 4a2 + 4a + 1 + 6a + 3 + 4 = 4a2 + 10a + 8
= 2(2a2 + 5a + 4). So n2 + 3 n + 4 = 2 b where b = 2a2 + 5a + 4 ∈ Z, so n2 + 3 n + 4 is even.
In either case n2 + 3n + 4 is even.

■

17. If two integers have opposite parity, then their product is even.
Proof. Suppose a and b are two integers with opposite parity. Thus one is even
and the other is odd. Without loss of generality, suppose a is even and b is
odd. Therefore there are integers c and d for which a = 2 c and b = 2d + 1. Then
the product of a and b is ab = 2 c(2 d + 1) = 2(2 cd + c). Therefore ab = 2k where
k = 2 cd + c ∈ Z. Therefore the product ab is even.
■
19. Suppose a, b, c ∈ Z. If a2 | b and b3 | c then a6 | c.
Proof. Since a2 | b we have b = ka2 for some k ∈ Z. Since b3 | c we have c = hb3 for
some h ∈ Z. Thus c = h(ka2 )3 = hk3 a6 . Hence a6 | c.

As k! is a product of numbers smaller than p, its prime factorization contains no

factorization of ¡ kp¢ ( p − k)! k! must contain a p, so the¡ prime

27. Suppose a, b ∈ N. If gcd(a, b) > 1, then b | a or b is not prime.
Proof. Suppose gcd(a, b) > 1. Let c = gcd(a, b) > 1. Then since c is a divisor of both
a and b, we have a = cx and b = c y for integers x and y. We divide into two cases
according to whether or not b is prime.
Case I. Suppose b is prime. Then the above equation b = c y with c > 1 forces
c = b and y = 1. Then a = cx becomes a = bx, which means b | a. We conclude that
the statement “b | a or b is not prime,” is true.
Case II. Suppose b is not prime. Then the statement “ b | a or b is not prime,” is
automatically true.

3. Suppose a, b ∈ Z. If a2 (b2 − 2b) is odd, then a and b are odd.

Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose it is not the case that a and b are odd. Then,
by DeMorgan’s law, at least one of a and b is even. Let us look at these cases
separately.
Case 1. Suppose a is even. Then a = 2 c for some integer c. Thus a2 (b2 − 2b)
= (2 c)2 ( b2 − 2 b) = 2(2 c2 ( b2 − 2 b)), which is even.
Case 2. Suppose b is even. Then b = 2 c for some integer c. Thus a2 (b2 − 2b)
= a2 ((2 c)2 − 2(2 c)) = 2(a2 (2 c2 − 2 c)), which is even.
(A third case involving a and b both even is unnecessary, for either of the two
cases above cover this case.) Thus in either case a2 (b2 − 2 b) is even, so it is not
odd.
■
5. Suppose x ∈ R. If x2 + 5 x < 0 then x < 0.
Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose it is not the case that x < 0, so x ≥ 0. Then
neither x2 nor 5 x is negative, so x2 + 5 x ≥ 0. Thus it is not true that x2 + 5 x < 0. ■
7. Suppose a, b ∈ Z. If both ab and a + b are even, then both a and b are even.
Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose it is not the case that both a and b are even.
Then at least one of them is odd. There are three cases to consider.
Case 1. Suppose a is even and b is odd. Then there are integers c and d for which
a = 2 c and b = 2 d + 1. Then ab = 2 c(2 d + 1), which is even; and a + b = 2 c + 2 d + 1 =
2( c + d ) + 1, which is odd. Thus it is not the case that both ab and a + b are even.
Case 2. Suppose a is odd and b is even. Then there are integers c and d for
which a = 2 c + 1 and b = 2d . Then ab = (2 c + 1)(2d ) = 2( d (2 c + 1)), which is even;
and a + b = 2 c + 1 + 2 d = 2( c + d ) + 1, which is odd. Thus it is not the case that both
ab and a + b are even.
Case 3. Suppose a is odd and b is odd. Then there are integers c and d for
which a = 2 c + 1 and b = 2 d + 1. Then ab = (2 c + 1)(2d + 1) = 4 cd + 2 c + 2 d + 1 =
2(2 cd + c + d ) + 1, which is odd; and a + b = 2 c + 1 + 2 d + 1 = 2( c + d + 1), which is even.
Thus it is not the case that both ab and a + b are even.
These cases show that it is not the case that ab and a + b are both even. (Note
that unlike Exercise 3 above, we really did need all three cases here, for each
case involved specific parities for both a and b.)
■
9. Suppose n ∈ Z. If 3 - n2 , then 3 - n.
Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose it is not the case that 3 - n, so 3 | n. This means
that n = 3a for some integer a. Consequently n2 = 9a2 , from which we get n2 =
3(3a2 ). This shows that there in an integer b = 3a2 for which n2 = 3 b, which
means 3 | n2 . Therefore it is not the case that 3 - n2 .

say x is odd and y is even. Thus there are integers a and b for which x = 2a + 1
and y = 2b. Consequently x2 ( y + 3) = (2a + 1)2 (2 b + 3) = (4a2 + 4a + 1)(2b + 3) =
8a2 b + 8ab + 2 b + 12a2 + 12a + 3 = 8a2 b + 8ab + 2 b + 12a2 + 12a + 2 + 1 =
2(4a2 b + 4ab + b + 6a2 + 6a + 1) + 1. This shows x2 ( y + 3) = 2 c + 1 for c = 4a2 b + 4ab +
b + 6a2 + 6a + 1 ∈ Z. Consequently, x2 ( y + 3) is not even.
■

13. Suppose x ∈ R. If x5 + 7 x3 + 5 x ≥ x4 + x2 + 8, then x ≥ 0.
Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose it is not true that x ≥ 0. Then x < 0, that is x is
negative. Consequently, the expressions x5 , 7 x3 and 5 x are all negative (note the
odd powers) so x5 + 7 x3 + 5 x < 0. Similarly the terms x4 , x2 and 8 are all positive
(note the even powers), so 0 < x4 + x2 + 8. From this we get x5 + 7 x3 + 5 x < x4 + x2 + 8,
so it is not true that x5 + 7 x3 + 5 x ≥ x4 + x2 + 8.
■
15. Suppose x ∈ Z. If x3 − 1 is even, then x is odd.
Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose x is not odd. Thus x is even, so x = 2a for some
integer a. Then x3 − 1 = (2a)3 − 1 = 8a3 − 1 = 8a3 − 2 + 1 = 2(4a3 − 1) + 1. Therefore
x3 − 1 = 2 b + 1 where b = 4a3 − 1 ∈ Z, so x3 − 1 is odd. Thus x3 − 1 is not even.
■
17. If n is odd, then 8 | (n2 − 1).
Proof. (Direct) Suppose n is odd, so n = 2a + 1 for some integer a. Then n2 − 1 =
(2a + 1)2 − 1 = 4a2 + 4a = 4(a2 + a) = 4a(a + 1). So far we have n2 − 1 = 4a(a + 1), but
we want a factor of 8, not 4. But notice that one of a or a + 1 must be even, so
a(a + 1) is even and hence a(a + 1) = 2 c for some integer c. Now we have n2 − 1 =
4a(a + 1) = 4(2 c) = 8 c. But n2 − 1 = 8 c means 8 | ( n2 − 1).
■
19. Let a, b, c ∈ Z and n ∈ N. If a ≡ b (mod n) and a ≡ c (mod n), then c ≡ b (mod n).
Proof. (Direct) Suppose a ≡ b (mod n) and a ≡ c (mod n).
This means n | (a − b) and n | (a − c).
Thus there are integers d and e for which a − b = nd and a − c = ne.
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives c − b = nd − ne.
Thus c − b = n( d − e), so n | ( c − b) by definition of divisibility.
Therefore c ≡ b (mod n) by definition of congruence modulo n.

29. If integers a and b are not both zero, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(a − b, b).
Proof. (Direct) Suppose integers a and b are not both zero. Let d = gcd(a, b).
Because d is a divisor of both a and b, we have a = dx and b = d y for some
integers x and y. Then a − b = dx − d y = d ( x − y), so it follows that d is also a
common divisor of a − b and b. Therefore it can’t be greater than the greatest
common divisor of a − b and b, which is to say gcd(a, b) = d ≤ gcd(a − b, b).
Now let e = gcd(a − b, b). Then e divides both a − b and b, that is, a − b = ex and
b = e y for integers x and y. Then a = (a − b) + b = ex + e y = e( x + y), so now we
see that e is a divisor of both a and b. Thus it is not more than their greatest
common divisor, that is, gcd(a − b, b) = e ≤ gcd(a, b).
The above two paragraphs have given gcd(a, b) ≤ gcd(a − b, b) and gcd(a − b, b) ≤
gcd(a, b). Thus gcd(a, b) = gcd(a − b, b).
■
31. Suppose the division algorithm applied to a and b yields a = qb + r . Then
gcd(a, b) = gcd( r, b).
Proof. Suppose a = qb + r . Let d = gcd(a, b), so d is a common divisor of a and b;
thus a = dx and b = d y for some integers x and y. Then dx = a = qb + r = qd y + r ,
hence dx = qd y + r , and so r = dx − qd y = d ( x − q y). Thus d is a divisor of r (and
also of b), so gcd(a, b) = d ≤ gcd( r, b).
On the other hand, let e = gcd(r, b), so r = ex and b = e y for some integers x and y.
Then a = qb + r = qe y + ex = e( q y + x). Hence e is a divisor of a (and of course also
of b) so gcd( r, b) = e ≤ gcd(a, b).
We’ve shown gcd(a, b) ≤ gcd( r, b) and gcd(r, b) ≤ gcd(a, b), so gcd(r, b) = gcd(a, b).

Thus n2 = (2a + 1)2 = 4a2 + 4a + 1 = 2(2a2 + 2a) + 1. This shows n2 = 2 b + 1, where

it is rational, so there exist integers a and b for which 3 2 = ab . Let us assume that
this fraction is reduced, so a and b are not both even. Now we have

2 = ab ,

which gives 2 = ab3 , or 2b3 = a3 . From this we see that a3 is even, from which we
deduce that a is even. (For if a were odd, then a3 = (2 c + 1)3 = 8 c3 + 12 c2 + 6 c + 1 =
2(4 c3 + 6 c2 + 3 c) + 1 would be odd, not even.) Since a is even, it follows that a = 2 d
for some integer d . The equation 2b3 = a3 from above then becomes 2b3 = (2d )3 ,
or 2b3 = 8d 3 . Dividing by 2, we get b3 = 4d 3 , and it follows that b3 is even. Thus b
is even also. (Using the same argument we used when a3 was even.) At this point
we have discovered that both a and b are even, contradicting the fact (observed
above) that the a and b are not both even.

that this fraction is reduced, so a and b have no common factor. Notice that

3 = b , so 3 = ab2 , or 3 b2 = a2 . This means 3 | a2 .
Now we are going to show that if a ∈ Z and 3 | a2 , then 3 | a. (This is a proof-withina-proof.) We will use contrapositive proof to prove this conditional statement.
Suppose 3 - a. Then there is a remainder of either 1 or 2 when 3 is divided into a.
Case 1. There is a remainder of 1 when 3 is divided into a. Then a = 3m + 1
for some integer m. Consequently, a2 = 9m2 + 6 m + 1 = 3(3m2 + 2 m) + 1, and this
means 3 divides into a2 with a remainder of 1. Thus 3 - a2 .
Case 2. There is a remainder of 2 when 3 is divided into a. Then a = 3m + 2 for
some integer m. Consequently, a2 = 9 m2 + 12m + 4 = 9m2 + 12 m + 3 + 1 = 3(3m2 +
4 m + 1) + 1, and this means 3 divides into a2 with a remainder of 1. Thus 3 - a2 .
In either case we have 3 - a2 , so we’ve shown 3 - a implies 3 - a2 . Therefore, if 3 | a2 ,
then 3 | a.

Now go back to 3 | a2 in the first paragraph. This combined with the result of
the second paragraph implies 3 | a, so a = 3 d for some integer d . Now also in the

b2 = 3 d 2 . But this means 3 | b2 , and the second paragraph implies 3 | b. Thus we

we have a2 = 4b + 3 = 2(2b + 1) + 1, which means a2 is odd. Therefore a is odd also,

9. Suppose a, b ∈ R and a 6= 0. If a is rational and ab is irrational, then b is irrational.
Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that a is rational and ab is irrational
and b is not irrational. Thus we have a and b rational, and ab irrational. Since a
and b are rational, we know there are integers c, d, e, f for which a = dc and b = fe .
Then ab = dcef , and since both ce and d f are integers, it follows that ab is rational.
But this is a contradiction because we started out with ab irrational.

11. There exist no integers a and b for which 18a + 6b = 1.

13. For every x ∈ [π/2, π], sin x − cos x ≥ 1.
Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that x ∈ [π/2, π], but sin x − cos x < 1.
Since x ∈ [π/2, π], we know sin x ≥ 0 and cos x ≤ 0, so sin x − cos x ≥ 0. Therefore
we have 0 ≤ sin x − cos x < 1. Now the square of any number between 0 and
1 is still a number between 0 and 1, so we have 0 ≤ (sin x − cos x)2 < 1, or 0 ≤
sin2 x − 2 sin x cos x + cos2 x < 1. Using the fact that sin2 x + cos2 x = 1, this becomes
0 ≤ −2 sin x cos x + 1 < 1. Subtracting 1, we obtain −2 sin x cos x < 0. But above we
remarked that sin x ≥ 0 and cos x ≤ 0, and hence −2 sin x cos x ≥ 0. We now have the
contradiction −2 sin x cos x < 0 and −2 sin x cos x ≥ 0.

17. For every n ∈ Z, 4 - (n2 + 2).
Proof. Assume there exists n ∈ Z with 4 | (n2 + 2). Then for some k ∈ Z, 4k = n2 + 2
or 2k = n2 + 2(1 − k). If n is odd, this means 2k is odd, and we’ve reached a
contradiction. If n is even then n = 2 j and we get k = 2 j 2 + 1 − k for some j ∈ Z.
Hence 2( k − j 2 ) = 1, so 1 is even, a contradiction.

Remark. It is fairly easy to see that two more than a perfect square is always
either 2 (mod 4) or 3 (mod 4). This would end the proof immediately.
19. The product of 5 consecutive integers is a multiple of 120.
Proof. Starting from 0, every fifth integer is a multiple of 5, every fourth integer
is a multiple of 4, every third integer is a multiple of 3, and every other integer
is a multiple of 2. It follows that any set of 5 consecutive integers must contain a
multiple of 5, a multiple of 4, at least one multiple of 3, and at least two multiples
of 2 (possibly one of which is a multiple of 4). It follows that the product of five
consecutive integers is a multiple of 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 = 120.

For another approach, consider a product n(n − 1)( n − 2)(n − 3)( n¡ −¢ 4) of five consecutive integers (the largest of which is n). Now, we know that n5 is an integer,

1. Suppose x ∈ Z. Then x is even if and only if 3 x + 5 is odd.
Proof. We first use direct proof to show that if x is even, then 3 x + 5 is odd. If x
is even, then x = 2n for some integer n, so 3 x + 5 = 3(2n) + 5 = 6n + 5 = 6n + 4 + 1 =
2(3 n + 2) + 1. Thus 3 x + 5 is odd because it has form 2 k + 1, where k = 3 n + 2 ∈ Z.
Conversely, we need to show that if 3 x + 5 is odd, then x is even. We will prove
this using contrapositive proof. Suppose x is not even. Then x is odd, so x = 2n + 1
for some integer n. Thus 3 x + 5 = 3(2n + 1) + 5 = 6 n + 8 = 2(3n + 4). This means says
3 x + 5 is twice the integer 3 n + 4, so 3 x + 5 is even, not odd.

3. Given an integer a, then a3 + a2 + a is even if and only if a is even.

Proof. First we will prove that if a3 + a2 + a is even then a is even. This is done
with contrapositive proof. Suppose a is not even. Then a is odd, so there is an
integer n for which a = 2n + 1. Then
a3 + a2 + a

=

(2 n + 1)3 + (2 n + 1)2 + (2 n + 1)

=

8 n3 + 12 n2 + 6 n + 1 + 4 n2 + 4 n + 1 + 2 n + 1

=

8 n3 + 16 n2 + 12 n + 2 + 1

=

2(4 n3 + 8 n2 + 6 n + 1) + 1.

This expresses a3 + a2 + a as twice an integer plus 1, so a3 + a2 + a is odd, not even.
We have now shown that if a3 + a2 + a is even then a is even.
Conversely, we need to show that if a is even, then a3 + a2 + a is even. We will use
direct proof. Suppose a is even, so a = 2n for some integer n. Then a3 + a2 + a =
(2 n)3 + (2 n)2 + 2 n = 8 n3 + 4 n2 + 2 n = 2(4 n3 + 2 n2 + n). Therefore, a3 + a2 + a is even
because it’s twice an integer.
■
5. An integer a is odd if and only if a3 is odd.
Proof. Suppose that a is odd. Then a = 2 n + 1 for some integer n, and a3 =
(2 n + 1)3 = 8 n3 + 12 n2 + 6 n + 1 = 2(4 n3 + 6 n2 + 3 n) + 1. This shows that a3 is twice an
integer, plus 1, so a3 is odd. Thus we’ve proved that if a is odd then a3 is odd.
Conversely we need to show that if a3 is odd, then a is odd. For this we employ
contrapositive proof. Suppose a is not odd. Thus a is even, so a = 2n for some
integer n. Then a3 = (2n)3 = 8n3 = 2(4n3 ) is even (not odd).
■
7. Suppose x, y ∈ R. Then ( x + y)2 = x2 + y2 if and only if x = 0 or y = 0.
Proof. First we prove with direct proof that if ( x + y)2 = x2 + y2 , then x = 0 or y = 0.
Suppose ( x + y)2 = x2 + y2 . From this we get x2 + 2 x y + y2 = x2 + y2 , so 2 x y = 0, and
hence x y = 0. Thus x = 0 or y = 0.
Conversely, we need to show that if x = 0 or y = 0, then ( x + y)2 = x2 + y2 . This will
be done with cases.
Case 1. If x = 0 then ( x + y)2 = (0 + y)2 = y2 = 02 + y2 = x2 + y2 .
Case 2. If y = 0 then ( x + y)2 = ( x + 0)2 = x2 = x2 + 02 = x2 + y2 .
Either way, we have ( x + y)2 = x2 + y2 .

9. Suppose a ∈ Z. Prove that 14 | a if and only if 7 | a and 2 | a.
Proof. First we prove that if 14 | a, then 7 | a and 2 | a. Direct proof is used.
Suppose 14 | a. This means a = 14 m for some integer m. Therefore a = 7(2m),
which means 7 | a, and also a = 2(7m), which means 2 | a. Thus 7 | a and 2 | a.
Conversely, we need to prove that if 7 | a and 2 | a, then 14 | a. Once again direct
proof if used. Suppose 7 | a and 2 | a. Since 2 | a it follows that a = 2m for some

325
integer m, and that in turn implies that a is even. Since 7 | a it follows that
a = 7 n for some integer n. Now, since a is known to be even, and a = 7 n, it follows
that n is even (if it were odd, then a = 7n would be odd). Thus n = 2 p for an
appropriate integer p, and plugging n = 2 p back into a = 7n gives a = 7(2 p), so
a = 14 p. Therefore 14 | a.
■
11. Suppose a, b ∈ Z. Prove that (a − 3) b2 is even if and only if a is odd or b is even.
Proof. First we will prove that if (a − 3) b2 is even, then a is odd or b is even. For
this we use contrapositive proof. Suppose it is not the case that a is odd or b is
even. Then by DeMorgan’s law, a is even and b is odd. Thus there are integers m
and n for which a = 2m and b = 2n + 1. Now observe (a − 3)b2 = (2 m − 3)(2n + 1)2 =
(2 m − 3)(4 n2 + 4 n + 1) = 8 mn2 + 8 mn + 2 m − 12 n2 − 12 n − 3 = 8 mn2 + 8 mn + 2 m − 12 n2 −
12 n − 4 + 1 = 2(4 mn2 + 4 mn + m − 6 n2 − 6 n − 2) + 1. This shows (a − 3) b2 is odd, so it’s

not even.
Conversely, we need to show that if a is odd or b is even, then (a − 3)b2 is even.
For this we use direct proof, with cases.
Case 1. Suppose a is odd. Then a = 2 m + 1 for some integer m. Thus (a − 3) b2 =
(2 m + 1 − 3) b2 = (2 m − 2) b2 = 2( m − 1) b2 . Thus in this case (a − 3) b2 is even.
Case 2. Suppose b is even. Then b = 2 n for some integer n. Thus (a − 3)b2 =
(a − 3)(2 n)2 = (a − 3)4 n2 = 2(a − 3)2 n2 =. Thus in this case (a − 3) b2 is even.
Therefore, in any event, (a − 3) b2 is even.

13. Suppose a, b ∈ Z. If a + b is odd, then a2 + b2 is odd.
Hint: Use direct proof. Suppose a + b is odd. Argue that this means a and b have

15. Suppose a, b ∈ Z. Prove that a + b is even if and only if a and b have the same
parity.
Proof. First we will show that if a + b is even, then a and b have the same parity.
For this we use contrapositive proof. Suppose it is not the case that a and b have
the same parity. Then one of a and b is even and the other is odd. Without loss
of generality, let’s say that a is even and b is odd. Thus there are integers m and
n for which a = 2 m and b = 2 n + 1. Then a + b = 2 m + 2 n + 1 = 2( m + n) + 1, so a + b
is odd, not even.
Conversely, we need to show that if a and b have the same parity, then a + b is
even. For this, we use direct proof with cases. Suppose a and b have the same
parity.
Case 1. Both a and b are even. Then there are integers m and n for which
a = 2 m and b = 2 n, so a + b = 2 m + 2 n = 2( m + n) is clearly even.
Case 2. Both a and b are odd. Then there are integers m and n for which
a = 2 m + 1 and b = 2 n + 1, so a + b = 2 m + 1 + 2 n + 1 = 2( m + n + 1) is clearly even.
Either way, a + b is even. This completes the proof.

Now subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2) to obtain 2S − S = −20 + 2n+1 , which
simplifies to S = 2n+1 − 1. Combining this with Equation (1) produces 20 + 21 +

a3 + ab2 + 3 b3 = 0.

Consider two cases: First, if both a and b are odd, the left-hand side is a sum
of three odds, which is odd, meaning 0 is odd, a contradiction. Second, if one of
a and b is odd and the other is even, then the middle term of a3 + ab2 + 3 b3 is
even, while a3 and 3 b2 have opposite parity. Then a3 + ab2 + 3b3 is the sum of two
evens and an odd, which is odd, again contradicting the fact that 0 is even. ■
23. Suppose a, b and c are integers. If a | b and a | (b2 − c), then a | c.

for some integers d and e. Squaring the first equation produces b2 = a2 d 2 .
Subtracting b2 − c = ae from b2 = a2 d 2 gives c = a2 d 2 − ae = a(ad 2 − e). As ad 2 − e ∈ Z,
it follows that a | c.

27. Suppose a, b ∈ Z. If a2 + b2 is a perfect square, then a and b are not both odd.
Proof. (Contradiction) Suppose a2 + b2 is a perfect square, and a and b are both
odd. As a2 + b2 is a perfect square, say c is the integer for which c2 = a2 + b2 . As
a and b are odd, we have a = 2 m + 1 and b = 2 n + 1 for integers m and n. Then
c2 = a2 + b2 = (2 m + 1)2 + (2 n + 1)2 = 4( m2 + n2 + m + n) + 2.

This is even, so c is even also; let c = 2k. Now the above equation results in
(2 k)2 = 4( m2 + n2 + m + n) + 2, which simplifies to 2 k2 = 2( m2 + n2 + m + n) + 1. Thus
2 k2 is both even and odd, a contradiction.

29. If a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a | c.
Proof. (Direct) Suppose a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1. The fact that a | bc means bc = az
for some integer z. The fact that gcd(a, b) = 1 means that ax + b y = 1 for some
integers x and y (by Proposition 7.1 on page 152). From this we get acx + bc y = c;
substituting bc = az yields acx + az y = c, that is, a( cx + z y) = c. Therefore a | c. ■
31. If n ∈ Z, then gcd(n, n + 1) = 1.
Proof. Suppose d is a positive integer that is a common divisor of n and n + 1.
Then n = dx and n + 1 = d y for integers x and y. Then 1 = ( n + 1) − n = d y − dx =
d ( y − x). Now, 1 = d ( y − x) is only possible if d = ±1 and y − x = ±1. Thus the
greatest common divisor of n and n + 1 can be no greater than 1. But 1 does
divide both n and n + 1, so gcd( n, n + 1) = 1.
■
33. If n ∈ Z, then gcd(2n + 1, 4 n2 + 1) = 1.
Proof. Note that 4n2 + 1 = (2 n + 1)(2n − 1) + 2. Therefore, it suffices to show that
gcd(2 n + 1, (2 n + 1)(2 n − 1) + 2) = 1. Let d be a common positive divisor of both 2 n + 1
and (2 n + 1)(2n − 1) + 2, so 2n + 1 = dx and (2 n + 1)(2n − 1) + 2 = d y for integers x
and y. Substituting the first equation into the second gives dx(2n − 1) + 2 = d y,
so 2 = d y − dx(2n − 1) = d ( y − 2nx + x). This means d divides 2, so d equals 1 or
2. But the equation 2n + 1 = dx means d must be odd. Therefore d = 1, that is,
gcd(2 n + 1, (2 n + 1)(2 n − 1) + 2) = 1.
■
35. Suppose a, b ∈ N. Then a = gcd(a, b) if and only if a | b.
Proof. Suppose a = gcd(a, b). This means a is a divisor of both a and b. In
particular a | b.
Conversely, suppose a | b. Then a divides both a and b, so a ≤ gcd(a, b). On the
other hand, since gcd(a, b) divides a, we have a = gcd(a, b) · x for some integer x.
As all integers involved are positive, it follows that a ≥ gcd (a, b).
It has been established that a ≤ gcd(a, b) and a ≥ gcd (a, b). Thus a = gcd(a, b).

19. Prove that {9n : n ∈ Z} ⊆ {3n : n ∈ Z}, but {9n : n ∈ Z} 6= {3n : n ∈ Z}.

Proof. Suppose a ∈ {9n : n ∈ Z}. This means a = 9n for some integer n ∈ Z. Thus
a = 9n = (32 )n = 32n . This shows a is an integer power of 3, so a ∈ {3n : n ∈ Z}.
Therefore a ∈ {9n : n ∈ Z} implies a ∈ {3n : n ∈ Z}, so {9n : n ∈ Z} ⊆ {3n : n ∈ Z}.
But notice {9n : n ∈ Z} 6= {3n : n ∈ Z} as 3 ∈ {3n : n ∈ Z}, but 3 ∉ {9n : n ∈ Z}.

21. Suppose A and B are sets. Prove A ⊆ B if and only if A − B = ;.
Proof. First we will prove that if A ⊆ B, then A − B = ;. Contrapositive proof is
used. Suppose that A − B 6= ;. Thus there is an element a ∈ A − B, which means
a ∈ A but a ∉ B. Since not every element of A is in B, we have A 6⊆ B.
Conversely, we will prove that if A − B = ;, then A ⊆ B. Again, contrapositive proof
is used. Suppose A 6⊆ B. This means that it is not the case that every element of
A is an element of B, so there is an element a ∈ A with a ∉ B. Therefore we have
a ∈ A − B, so A − B 6= ;.

have (−1, 0) ∈ A a because A a contains the ordered pair (−1, a((−1)2 − 1)) = (−1, 0).
Similarly (1, 0) ∈ A\

so {(−1, 0), (1, 0)} ⊆

that d =

( x, x − 1) : x ∈ R . Therefore ( c, 0) has the form ( c, c2 − 1), that is ( c, 0) = ( c, c2 − 1).
From this we get c2 − 1 = 0, so c = ±1. Therefore ( c, d ) = (1, 0) or ( c, d\
) = (−1, 0), so
( c, d ) ∈ {(−1, 0), (1, 0)}. This completes the demonstration that ( c, d ) ∈

( c, d ) ∈ {(−1, 0), (1, 0)}, so it follows that

Proof. Suppose (a, b) ∈ ( A × B) ∪ (C × D ).
By definition of union, this means (a, b) ∈ ( A × B) or (a, b) ∈ (C × D ).
We examine these two cases individually.

Case 1. Suppose (a, b) ∈ ( A × B). By definition of ×, it follows that a ∈ A and b ∈ B.
From this, it follows from the definition of ∪ that a ∈ A ∪ C and b ∈ B ∪ D .
Again from the definition of ×, we get (a, b) ∈ ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ).
Case 2. Suppose (a, b) ∈ (C × D ). By definition of ×, it follows that a ∈ C and b ∈ D .
From this, it follows from the definition of ∪ that a ∈ A ∪ C and b ∈ B ∪ D .
Again from the definition of ×, we get (a, b) ∈ ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ).
In either case, we obtained (a, b) ∈ ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ),
so we’ve proved that (a, b) ∈ ( A × B) ∪ (C × D ) implies (a, b) ∈ ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ).
Therefore ( A × B) ∪ (C × D ) ⊆ ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ).

27. Prove {12a + 4b : a, b ∈ Z} = {4 c : c ∈ Z}.
Proof. First we show {12a + 4b : a, b ∈ Z} ⊆ {4 c : c ∈ Z}. Suppose x ∈ {12a + 4b : a, b ∈ Z}.
Then x = 12a + 4b for some integers a and b. From this we get x = 4(3a + b), so
x = 4 c where c is the integer 3a + b. Consequently x ∈ {4 c : c ∈ Z}. This establishes
that {12a + 4 b : a, b ∈ Z} ⊆ {4 c : c ∈ Z}.
Next we show {4 c : c ∈ Z} ⊆ {12a + 4b : a, b ∈ Z}. Suppose x ∈ {4 c : c ∈ Z}. Then x = 4 c
for some c ∈ Z. Thus x = (12 + 4(−2)) c = 12 c + 4(−2 c), and since c and −2 c are
integers we have x ∈ {12a + 4b : a, b ∈ Z}.
This proves that {12a + 4b : a, b ∈ Z} = {4 c : c ∈ Z}.

29. Suppose A 6= ;. Prove that A × B ⊆ A × C , if and only if B ⊆ C .
Proof. First we will prove that if A × B ⊆ A × C , then B ⊆ C . Using contrapositive,
suppose that B 6⊆ C . This means there is an element b ∈ B with b ∉ C . Since A 6= ;,
there exists an element a ∈ A . Now consider the ordered pair (a, b). Note that
(a, b) ∈ A × B, but (a, b) 6∈ A × C . This means A × B 6⊆ A × C .
Conversely, we will now show that if B ⊆ C , then A × B ⊆ A × C . We use direct
proof. Suppose B ⊆ C . Assume that (a, b) ∈ A × B. This means a ∈ A and b ∈ B.
But, as B ⊆ C , we also have b ∈ C . From a ∈ A and b ∈ C , we get (a, b) ∈ A × C .
We’ve now shown (a, b) ∈ A × B implies (a, b) ∈ A × C , so A × B ⊆ A × C .

Proof. Suppose B 6= ; and A × B ⊆ B × C . In what follows, we show that A ⊆ C .
Let x ∈ A . Because B is not empty, it contains some element b. Observe that
( x, b) ∈ A × B. But as A × B ⊆ B × C , we also have ( x, b) ∈ B × C , so, in particular,
x ∈ B. As x ∈ A and x ∈ B, we have ( x, x) ∈ A × B. But as A × B ⊆ B × C , it follows that
( x, x) ∈ B × C . This implies x ∈ C . We’ve shown x ∈ A implies x ∈ C , so A ⊆ C .

1. If x, y ∈ R, then | x + y| = | x| + | y|.
This is false.
Disproof: Here is a counterexample: Let x = 1 and y = −1. Then | x + y| = 0 and
| x| + | y| = 2, so it’s not true that | x + y| = | x| + | y|.
3. If n ∈ Z and n5 − n is even, then n is even.
This is false.
Disproof: Here is a counterexample: Let n = 3. Then n5 − n = 35 − 3 = 240, but n is
not even.
5. If A , B, C and D are sets, then ( A × B) ∪ (C × D ) = ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ).
This is false.
Disproof: Here is a counterexample: Let A = {1, 2}, B = {1, 2}, C = {2, 3} and
D = {2, 3}. Then ( A × B) ∪ (C × D ) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)} ∪ {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)} =
{(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)} . Also ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ) = {1, 2, 3} × {1, 2, 3}=
{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}, so you can see that ( A × B) ∪ (C ×
D ) 6= ( A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D ).
7. If A , B and C are sets, and A × C = B × C , then A = B.
This is false.
Disproof: Here is a counterexample: Let A = {1}, B = {2} and C = ;. Then A × C =
B × C = ;, but A 6= B.
9. If A and B are sets, then P ( A ) − P (B) ⊆ P ( A − B).
This is false.
Disproof: Here is a counterexample: Let A = {1, 2} and B = {1}. Then P ( A ) −
P (B) = {;, {1} , {2} , {1, 2}} − {;, {1}} = {{2} , {1, 2}}. Also P ( A − B) = P ({2}) = {;, {2}}. In
this example we have P ( A ) − P (B) 6⊆ P ( A − B).
11. If a, b ∈ N, then a + b < ab.
This is false.
Disproof: Here is a counterexample: Let a = 1 and b = 1. Then a + b = 2 and ab = 1,
so it’s not true that a + b < ab.
13. There exists a set X for which R ⊆ X and ; ∈ X .
This is true.
Proof. Simply let X = R ∪ {;}. If x ∈ R, then x ∈ R ∪ {;} = X , so R ⊆ X . Likewise,
; ∈ R ∪ {;} = X because ; ∈ {;}.

15. Every odd integer is the sum of three odd integers.
This is true.
Proof. If n is odd, then n = n + 1 + (−1). Thus n is the sum of three odd integers. ■

This is false.
Disproof: Here is a counterexample: Just let A = ; and B = ;. Then A − B = ;,
but it’s not true that B 6= ;.

19. For every r, s ∈ Q with r < s, there is an irrational number u for which r < u < s.
This is true.

Proof. (Direct) Suppose r, s ∈ Q with r < s. Consider the number u = r + 2 s−2 r . In
what follows we will show that upis irrational and r < up< s. Certainly since s − r
is positive, it follows that r < r + 2 s−2 r = u. Also, since 2 < 2 we have

u= r+ 2

and therefore u < s. Thus we can conclude r < u < s.
Now we just need to show that u is irrational. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that u is rational. Then u = ab for some integers a and b. Since r and s are
rational, we have r = dc and s = fe for some c, d, e, f ∈ Z. Now we have

In summary, we have produced an irrational number u with r < u < s, so the
proof is complete.
■
21. There exist two prime numbers p and q for which p − q = 97.
This statement is false.
Disproof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that this is true. Let p and q be
prime numbers for which p − q = 97. Now, since their difference is odd, p and q
must have opposite parity, so one of p and q is even and the other is odd. But
there exists only one even prime number (namely 2), so either p = 2 or q = 2. If
p = 2, then p − q = 97 implies q = 2 − 97 = −95, which is not prime. On the other
hand if q = 2, then p − q = 97 implies p = 99, but that’s not prime either. Thus one
of p or q is not prime, a contradiction.
23. If x, y ∈ R and x3 < y3 , then x < y. This is true.
Proof. (Contrapositive) Suppose x ≥ y. We need to show x3 ≥ y3 .
Case 1. Suppose x and y have opposite signs, that is one of x and y is positive
and the other is negative. Then since x ≥ y, x is positive and y is negative. Then,
since the powers are odd, x3 is positive and y3 is negative, so x3 ≥ y3 .
Case 2. Suppose x and y do not have opposite signs. Then x2 + x y + y2 ≥ 0 and

also x − y ≥ 0 because x ≥ y. Thus we have x3 − y3 = ( x − y)( x2 + x y + y2 ) ≥ 0. From
this we get x3 − y3 ≥ 0, so x3 ≥ y3 .
In either case we have x3 ≥ y3 .

25. For all a, b, c ∈ Z, if a | bc, then a | b or a | c.

27. The equation x2 = 2 x has three real solutions.
Proof. By inspection, the numbers x = 2 and x = 4 are two solutions of this
equation. But there is a third solution. Let m be a positive real number for
which m2m = 12 . (The existence of such an m is guaranteed by the intermediate
value theorem of calculus.) Then negative number x = −2m is a solution, as

33. Suppose f ( x) = a 0 + a 1 x + a 2 x2 + · · · + a n x n is a polynomial of degree 1 or greater,
and for which each coefficient a i is in N. Then there is an n ∈ N for which the
integer f (n) is not prime.
Proof. (Outline) Because the coefficients are all positive and the degree is greater
than 1, we have f (1) > 1. Let b = f (1) > 1. The polynomial f ( x) − b has a root 1, so
f ( x) − b = ( x − 1) g( x) for some polynomial g. Then f ( x) = ( x − 1) g( x) + b. Note that
f ( b + 1) = b g( b + 1) + b = b( g( b + 1) + 1). If we can show that g( b + 1) + 1 is an integer
greater than 1, then we have a nontrivial factoring f (b + 1) = b( g(b + 1) + 1), so
f ( b+1) is not prime. To complete the proof, use the fact that f ( x)− b = ( x−1) g( x) has
integer coefficients, and deduce that g( x) must also have integer coefficients. ■

9. Prove that 24 | (52n − 1) for any integer n ≥ 0.
Proof. The proof is by mathematical induction.
(1) For n = 0, the statement is 24 | (52·0 − 1). This is 24 | 0, which is true.
(2) Now assume the statement is true for some integer n = k ≥ 0, that is assume
24 | (52k − 1). This means 52k − 1 = 24a for some integer a, and from this we
get 52k = 24a + 1. Now observe that

This shows 52(k+1) − 1 = 24(25a + 1), which means 24 | 52(k+1) − 1.
This completes the proof by mathematical induction.

11. Prove that 3 | (n3 + 5 n + 6) for any integer n ≥ 0.
Proof. The proof is by mathematical induction.
(1) When n = 0, the statement is 3 | (03 + 5 · 0 + 6), or 3 | 6, which is true.
(2) Now assume the statement is true for some integer n = k ≥ 0, that is assume
3 | ( k3 + 5 k + 6). This means k3 + 5 k + 6 = 3a for some integer a. We need to
show that 3 | ((k + 1)3 + 5(k + 1) + 6). Observe that
( k + 1)3 + 5( k + 1) + 6

=

k3 + 3 k2 + 3 k + 1 + 5 k + 5 + 6

=

( k3 + 5 k + 6) + 3 k2 + 3 k + 6

=

3a + 3 k2 + 3 k + 6

=

3(a + k2 + k + 2).

Thus we have deduced (k + 1)3 − (k + 1) = 3(a + k2 + k + 2). Since a + k2 + k + 2 is
an integer, it follows that 3 | (( k + 1)3 + 5( k + 1) + 6).
It follows by mathematical induction that 3 | (n3 + 5 n + 6) for every n ≥ 0.

(2) Now assume the statement is true for some integer n = k ≥ 0, that is, assume
6 | ( k3 − k). This means k3 − k = 6a for some integer a. We need to show that
6 | (( k + 1)3 − ( k + 1)). Observe that
( k + 1)3 − ( k + 1)

=

k3 + 3 k2 + 3 k + 1 − k − 1

=

( k3 − k) + 3 k2 + 3 k

=

6a + 3 k2 + 3 k

=

6a + 3 k( k + 1).

Thus we have deduced (k + 1)3 − (k + 1) = 6a + 3k(k + 1). Since one of k or (k + 1)
must be even, it follows that k( k + 1) is even, so k(k + 1) = 2b for some integer
b. Consequently ( k + 1)3 − ( k + 1) = 6a + 3 k( k + 1) = 6a + 3(2 b) = 6(a + b). Since
( k + 1)3 − ( k + 1) = 6(a + b) it follows that 6 | (( k + 1)3 − ( k + 1)).

A1 ∩ A2 ∩ · · · ∩ A n = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ A n .
Proof. The proof is by strong induction.
(1) When n = 2 the statement is A 1 ∩ A 2 = A 1 ∪ A 2 . This is not an entirely
obvious statement, so we have to prove it. Observe that
A1 ∩ A2

=

{ x : ( x ∈ U ) ∧ ( x ∉ A 1 ∩ A 2 )} (definition of complement)

=

{ x : ( x ∈ U )∧ ∼ ( x ∈ A 1 ∩ A 2 )}

=

{ x : ( x ∈ U )∧ ∼ (( x ∈ A 1 ) ∧ ( x ∈ A 2 ))} (definition of ∩)

=

{ x : ( x ∈ U ) ∧ ( x ∉ A 1 ) ∨ ( x ∈ U ) ∧ ( x ∉ A 2 )} (distributive prop.)

=

{ x : (( x ∈ U ) ∧ ( x ∉ A 1 ))} ∪ { x : (( x ∈ U ) ∧ ( x ∉ A 2 ))} (def. of ∪)

=

A 1 ∪ A 2 (definition of complement).

(2) Let k ≥ 2. Assume the statement is true if it involves k or fewer sets. Then
A 1 ∩ A 2 ∩ · · · ∩ A k−1 ∩ A k ∩ A k+1

=

A 1 ∩ A 2 ∩ · · · ∩ A k−1 ∩ ( A k ∩ A k+1 )

=

A 1 ∪ A 2 ∪ · · · ∪ A k−1 ∪ A k ∪ A k+1 .

Thus the statement is true when it involves k + 1 sets.
This completes the proof by strong induction.

25. Concerning the Fibonacci sequence, prove that F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + . . . + F n = F n+2 − 1.
Proof. The proof is by induction.
(1) When n = 1 the statement is F1 = F1+2 − 1 = F3 − 1 = 2 − 1 = 1, which is true.
Also when n = 2 the statement is F1 + F2 = F2+2 − 1 = F4 − 1 = 3 − 1 = 2, which
is true, as F1 + F2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
(2) Now assume k ≥ 1 and F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + . . . + F k = F k+2 − 1. We need to show
F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + . . . + F k + F k+1 = F k+3 − 1. Observe that

Proof. The proof is by induction. For the basis step, suppose n = 1. Then there
is one line, and it clearly divides the plane into 2 regions, one on either side of
2
2
the line. As 2 = 1 +21+2 = n +2n+2 , the formula is correct when n = 1.

Now suppose there are n + 1 lines on the plane, and that the formula is correct
for when there are n lines on the plane. Single out one of the n + 1 lines on the
plane, and call it `. Remove line `, so that there are now n lines on the plane.
`
By the induction hypothesis, these n lines din2 + n+2

vide the plane into

line ` back. Doing this adds an additional

Thus, with n + 1 lines, we have (n+1) +2(n+1)+2 regions, which means that the

9. Define a relation on Z by declaring xR y if and only if x and y have the same
parity. Say whether this relation is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. If a
property does not hold, say why. What familiar relation is this?
This is reflexive because xRx since x always has the same parity as x.
It is symmetric because if x and y have the same parity, then y and x must
have the same parity (that is, xR y ⇒ yRx).
It is transitive because if x and y have the same parity and y and z have the
same parity, then x and z must have the same parity. (That is ( xR y ∧ yR z) ⇒ xR z
always holds.)
The relation is congruence modulo 2.
11. Suppose A = {a, b, c, d } and R = {(a, a), (b, b), ( c, c), (d, d )}. Say whether this relation
is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. If a property does not hold, say why.
This is reflexive because ( x, x) ∈ R for every x ∈ A .
It is symmetric because it is impossible to find an ( x, y) ∈ R for which ( y, x) ∉ R .
It is transitive because ( xR y ∧ yR z) ⇒ xR z always holds.
(For example (aRa ∧ aRa) ⇒ aRa is true, etc.)
13. Consider the relation R = {( x, y) ∈ R × R : x − y ∈ Z} on R. Prove that this relation is
reflexive and symmetric, and transitive.
Proof. In this relation, xR y means x − y ∈ Z.
To see that R is reflexive, take any x ∈ R and observe that x − x = 0 ∈ Z, so xRx.
Therefore R is reflexive.
To see that R is symmetric, we need to prove xR y ⇒ yRx for all x, y ∈ R. We use
direct proof. Suppose xR y. This means x − y ∈ Z. Then it follows that −( x − y) = y− x
is also in Z. But y − x ∈ Z means yRx. We’ve shown xR y implies yRx, so R is
symmetric.
To see that R is transitive, we need to prove ( xR y ∧ yR z) ⇒ xR z is always true. We
prove this conditional statement with direct proof. Suppose xR y and yR z. Since
xR y, we know x − y ∈ Z. Since yR z, we know y − z ∈ Z. Thus x − y and y − z are both
integers; by adding these integers we get another integer ( x − y) + ( y − z) = x − z.
Thus x − z ∈ Z, and this means xR z. We’ve now shown that if xR y and yR z, then
xR z. Therefore R is transitive.

15. Prove or disprove: If a relation is symmetric and transitive, then it is also
reflexive.
This is false. For a counterexample, consider the relation R = {(a, a), (a, b), (b, a), (b, b)}

17. Define a relation ∼ on Z as x ∼ y if and only if | x − y| ≤ 1. Say whether ∼ is reflexive,
symmetric and transitive.
This is reflexive because | x − x| = 0 ≤ 1 for all integers x. It is symmetric because
x ∼ y if and only if | x − y| ≤ 1, if and only if | y − x| ≤ 1, if and only if y ∼ x. It is not
transitive because, for example, 0 ∼ 1 and 1 ∼ 2, but is not the case that 0 ∼ 2.

Section 11.3
1. Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and consider the following equivalence relation on A : R =
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 4), (5, 6), (6, 5)}. List
the equivalence classes of R .
The equivalence classes are: [1] = {1};

[2] = [3] = {2, 3};

[4] = [5] = [6] = {4, 5, 6}.

3. Let A = {a, b, c, d, e}. Suppose R is an equivalence relation on A . Suppose R has
three equivalence classes. Also aRd and bR c. Write out R as a set.
Answer: R = {(a, a), (b, b), ( c, c), (d, d ), ( e, e), (a, d ), (d, a), (b, c), ( c, b)}.
5. There are two equivalence relations on the set A = {a, b}. Describe them.
Answer: R = {(a, a), (b, b)} and R = {(a, a), (b, b), (a, b), (b, a)}
7. Define a relation R on Z as xR y if and only if 3 x − 5 y is even. Prove R is an
equivalence relation. Describe its equivalence classes.
We must prove that R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
The relation R is reflexive for the following reason. If x ∈ Z, then 3 x − 5 x = −2 x is
even. But then since 3 x − 5 x is even, we have xRx. Thus R is reflexive.
To see that R is symmetric, suppose xR y. We must show yRx. Since xR y, we
know 3 x − 5 y is even, so 3 x − 5 y = 2a for some integer a. Now reason as follows:
3x − 5 y

=

2a

3x − 5 y + 8 y − 8x

=

2a + 8 y − 8 x

3 y − 5x

=

2(a + 4 y − 4 x).

From this it follows that 3 y − 5 x is even, so yRx. We’ve now shown xR y implies
yRx, so R is symmetric.
To prove that R is transitive, assume that xR y and yR z. (We will show that this
implies xR z.) Since xR y and yR z, it follows that 3 x − 5 y and 3 y − 5 z are both even,
so 3 x − 5 y = 2a and 3 y − 5 z = 2b for some integers a and b. Adding these equations,
we get (3 x − 5 y) + (3 y − 5 z) = 2a + 2b, and this simplifies to 3 x − 5 z = 2(a + b + y).
Therefore 3 x − 5 z is even, so xR z. We’ve now shown that if xR y and yR z, then
xR z, so R is transitive.
We’ve shown R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, so it’s an equivalence
relation.
The completes the first part of the problem. Now we move on the second part.
To find the equivalence classes, first note that
[0] = { x ∈ Z : xR 0} = { x ∈ Z : 3 x − 5 · 0 is even} = { x ∈ Z : 3 x is even} = { x ∈ Z : x is even} .

Thus the equivalence class [0] consists of all even integers. Next, note that
©
ª
[1] = { x ∈ Z : xR 1} = { x ∈ Z : 3 x − 5 · 1 is even} = { x ∈ Z : 3 x − 5 is even} = x ∈ Z : x is odd .

Thus the equivalence class [1] consists of all odd integers.
Consequently there are just two equivalence classes {. . . , −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, . . .} and
{. . . , −3, −1, 1, 3, 5, . . .}.

9. Define a relation R on Z as xR y if and only if 4 | ( x + 3 y). Prove R is an equivalence
relation. Describe its equivalence classes.
This is reflexive, because for any x ∈ Z we have 4 | ( x + 3 x), so xRx.
To prove that R is symmetric, suppose xR y. Then 4 | ( x + 3 y), so x + 3 y = 4a for some
integer a. Multiplying by 3, we get 3 x + 9 y = 12a, which becomes y + 3 x = 12a − 8 y.
Then y + 3 x = 4(3a − 2 y), so 4 | ( y + 3 x), hence yRx. Thus we’ve shown xR y implies
yRx, so R is symmetric.
To prove transitivity, suppose xR y and yR z. Then 4|( x + 3 y) and 4|( y + 3 z), so
x + 3 y = 4a and y + 3 z = 4 b for some integers a and b. Adding these two equations
produces x + 4 y + 3 z = 4a + 4b, or x + 3 z = 4a + 4b − 4 y = 4(a + b − y). Consequently
4|( x + 3 z), so xR z, and R is transitive.
As R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, it is an equivalence relation.
Now let’s compute its equivalence classes.
[0] = { x ∈ Z : xR 0} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | ( x + 3 · 0)} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | x} =
{. . . − 4, 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 . . .}
[1] = { x ∈ Z : xR 1} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | ( x + 3 · 1)} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | ( x + 3)} = {. . . − 3, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 . . .}
[2] = { x ∈ Z : xR 2} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | ( x + 3 · 2)} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | ( x + 6)} = {. . . − 2, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 . . .}
[3] = { x ∈ Z : xR 3} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | ( x + 3 · 3)} = { x ∈ Z : 4 | ( x + 9)} = {. . . − 1, 3, 7, 11, 15, 19 . . .}

1. Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {a, b, c}. Give an example of a function f : A → B that is
neither injective nor surjective.
Consider f = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, a), (4, a)}.
Then f is not injective because f (1) = f (2).
Also f is not surjective because it sends no element of A to the element c ∈ B.
3. Consider the cosine function cos : R → R. Decide whether this function is injective
and whether it is surjective. What if it had been defined as cos : R → [−1, 1]?
The function cos : R → R is not injective because, for example, cos(0) = cos(2π). It
is not surjective because if b = 5 ∈ R (for example), there is no real number for
which cos( x) = b. The function cos : R → [−1, 1] is surjective but not injective.
5. A function f : Z → Z is defined as f (n) = 2 n + 1. Verify whether this function is
injective and whether it is surjective.
This function is injective. To see this, suppose m, n ∈ Z and f (m) = f (n).
This means 2m + 1 = 2 n + 1, from which we get 2m = 2n, and then m = n.
Thus f is injective.
This function is not surjective. To see this notice that f ( n) is odd for all n ∈ Z.
So given the (even) number 2 in the codomain Z, there is no n with f ( n) = 2.
7. A function f : Z × Z → Z is defined as f ((m, n)) = 2n − 4m. Verify whether this
function is injective and whether it is surjective.
This is not injective because (0, 2) 6= (−1, 0), yet f ((0, 2)) = f ((−1, 0)) = 4. This is
not surjective because f ((m, n)) = 2n − 4m = 2(n − 2m) is always even. If b ∈ Z is
odd, then f ((m, n)) 6= b, for all (m, n) ∈ Z × Z.
9. Prove that the function f : R − {2} → R − {5} defined by f ( x) = 5xx−+21 is bijective.
Proof. First, let’s check that f is injective. Suppose f ( x) = f ( y). Then

Since f ( x) = f ( y) implies x = y, it follows that f is injective.
Next we check that f is surjective. Take an arbitrary element b ∈ R−{5}. We seek
an x ∈ R − {2} for which f ( x) = b, or 5xx−+21 = b. Solving this for x, we get:

11. Consider the function θ : {0, 1} × N → Z defined as θ (a, b) = (−1)a b. Is θ injective?
Is it surjective? Explain.
First we show that θ is injective. Suppose θ (a, b) = θ ( c, d ). Then (−1)a b = (−1) c d .
As b and d are both in N, they are both positive. Then because (−1)a b = (−1) c d ,
it follows that (−1)a and (−1) c have the same sign. Since each of (−1)a and (−1) c
equals ±1, we have (−1)a = (−1) c , so then (−1)a b = (−1) c d implies b = d . But also
(−1)a = (−1) c means a and c have the same parity, and because a, c ∈ {0, 1}, it
follows a = c. Thus (a, b) = ( c, d ), so θ is injective.
Next note that θ is not surjective because θ (a, b) = (−1)a b is either positive or
negative, but never zero. Therefore there exist no element (a, b) ∈ {0, 1} × N for
which θ (a, b) = 0 ∈ Z.
13. Consider the function f : R2 → R2 defined by the formula f ( x, y) = ( x y, x3 ). Is f
injective? Is it surjective?
Notice that f (0, 1) = (0, 0) and f (0, 0) = (0, 0), so f is not injective. To show that f
is also not surjective, we will show that it’s impossible to find an ordered pair
( x, y) with f ( x, y) = (1, 0). If there were such a pair, then f ( x, y) = ( x y, x3 ) = (1, 0),
which yields x y = 1 and x3 = 0. From x3 = 0 we get x = 0, so x y = 0, a contradiction.
15. This question concerns functions f : { A, B, C, D, E, F,G } → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. How
many such functions are there? How many of these functions are injective? How
many are surjective? How many are bijective?
Function f can described as a list ( f ( A ), f (B), f (C ), f (D ), f (E ), f (F ), f (G )), where
there are seven choices for each entry. By the multiplication principle, the total
number of functions f is 77 = 823543.
If f is injective, then this list can’t have any repetition, so there are 7! = 5040
injective functions. Since any injective function sends the seven elements of the
domain to seven distinct elements of the codomain, all of the injective functions
are surjective, and vice versa. Thus there are 5040 surjective functions and 5040
bijective functions.
17. This question concerns functions f : { A, B, C, D, E, F,G } → {1, 2}. How many such
functions are there? How many of these functions are injective? How many are
surjective? How many are bijective?
Function f can described as a list ( f ( A ), f (B), f (C ), f (D ), f (E ), f (F ), f (G )), where
there are two choices for each entry. Therefore the total number of functions
is 27 = 128. It is impossible for any function to send all seven elements of
{ A, B, C, D, E, F,G } to seven distinct elements of {1, 2}, so none of these 128 functions is injective, hence none are bijective.
How many are surjective? Only two of the 128 functions are not surjective, and
they are the “constant” functions {( A, 1), (B, 1), (C, 1), (D, 1), (E, 1), (F, 1), (G, 1)} and
{( A, 2), (B, 2), (C, 2), (D, 2), (E, 2), (F, 2), (G, 2)}. So there are 126 surjective functions.

1. If 6 integers are chosen at random, at least two will have the same remainder
when divided by 5.
Proof. Write Z as follows: Z = 4j=0 {5k + j : k ∈ Z}. This is a partition of Z into 5
sets. If six integers are picked at random, by the pigeonhole principle, at least
two will be in the same set. However, each set corresponds to the remainder
of a number after being divided by 5 (for example, {5k + 1 : k ∈ Z} are all those
integers that leave a remainder of 1 after being divided by 5).

3. Given any six positive integers, there are two for which their sum or difference
is divisible by 9.
Proof. Let A be a set of six positive integers. Let B = {0} , {1, 8} , {2, 7} , {3, 6} , {4, 5} .
Notice that every element of B is a set that either has one element or has two
elements whose sum is 9. Define f : A → B so that f ( x) is the set that contains
the remainder when x is divided by 9. For example, f (12) = {3, 6} and f (18) = {0}.
Since 6 = | A | > |B| = 5, the pigeonhole principle implies that f is not injective.
Thus there exist x, y ∈ A for which f ( x) = f ( y). Then either x and y have the same
reminder r when divided by 9, or the remainders r and s add to 9. In the first
case x = 9m + r and y = 9n + r (for m, n ∈ Z), so x − y = 9( m − n) is divisible by 9. In
the second case x = 9m + r and y = 9n + s, so x + y = 9m + 9n + r + s = 9( m + n + 1) is
divisible by 9.

5. Prove that any set of 7 distinct natural numbers contains a pair of numbers
whose sum or difference is divisible by 10.
Proof. Let S = {a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , a 5 , a 6 , a 7 } be any set of 7 natural numbers. Let’s say
that a 1 < a 2 < a 3 < · · · < a 7 . Consider the set
A

=

{a 1 − a 2 , a 1 − a 3 , a 1 − a 4 , a 1 − a 5 , a 1 − a 6 , a 1 − a 7 ,
a1 + a2 , a1 + a3 , a1 + a4 , a1 + a5 , a1 + a6 , a1 + a7 }

Thus | A | = 12. Now let B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, so |B| = 10. Let f : A → B be the
function for which f (n) equals the last digit of n. (That is f (97) = 7, f (12) = 2,
f (230) = 0, etc.) Then, since | A | > |B|, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that f
is not injective. Thus A contains elements a 1 ± a i and a 1 ± a j for which f (a 1 ± a i ) =
f (a 1 ± a j ). This means the last digit of a 1 ± a i is the same as the last digit of
a 1 ± a j . Thus the last digit of the difference (a 1 ± a i ) − (a 1 ± a j ) = ±a i ± a j is 0.
Hence ±a i ± a j is a sum or difference of elements of S that is divisible by 10. ■

Note g ◦ f (m, n) = g( f (m, n)) = g(mn, m2 ) = (mn + 1, mn + m2 ).
Thus g ◦ f (m, n) = (mn + 1, mn + m2 ).
Note f ◦ g (m, n) = f ( g(m, n)) = f (m + 1, m + n) = ((m + 1)( m + n), (m + 1)2 ).

It is injective as follows. Suppose f (m) = f (n). Then 6 − m = 6 − n, which reduces

It is injective as follows. Suppose f (m) = f (n), which means 2m = 2n . Taking log2

7. Show that the function f : R2 → R2 defined by the formula f (( x, y) = (( x2 + 1) y, x3 )
is bijective. Then find its inverse.
First we prove the function is injective. Assume f ( x1 , y1 ) = f ( x2 , y2 ). Then ( x12 +
1) y1 = ( x22 + 1) y2 and x13 = x23 . Since the real-valued function f ( x) = x3 is one-to-one,
it follows that x1 = x2 . Since x1 = x2 , and x12 + 1 > 0 we may divide both sides of
( x12 + 1) y1 = ( x12 + 1) y2 by ( x12 + 1) to get y1 = y2 . Hence ( x1 , y1 ) = ( x2 , y2 ).
Now we prove the function is surjective. Let (a, b) ∈ R2 . Set x = b1/3 and y =
a/( b2/3 + 1). Then f ( x, y) = (( b2/3 + 1) b2/3a+1 , ( b1/3 )3 ) = (a, b). It now follows that f is
bijective.

Finally, we compute the inverse. Write f ( x, y) = ( u, v). Interchange variables to
get ( x, y) = f (u, v) = (( u2 + 1)v, u3 ). Thus³x = (u2 + 1)´v and y = u3 . Hence u = y1/3 and
v = y2/3x+1 . Therefore f −1 ( x, y) = ( u, v) = y1/3 , y2/3x+1 .
9. Consider the function f : R×N → N×R defined as f ( x, y) = ( y, 3 x y). Check that this
is bijective; find its inverse.
To see that this is injective, suppose f (a, b) = f ( c, d ). This means (b, 3ab) = ( d, 3 cd ).
Since the first coordinates must be equal, we get b = d . As the second coordinates
are equal, we get 3ab = 3 dc, which becomes 3ab = 3bc. Note that, from the
definition of f , b ∈ N, so b 6= 0. Thus we can divide both sides of 3ab = 3bc by the
non-zero quantity 3b to get a = c. Now we have a = c and b = d , so (a, b) = ( c, d ). It
follows that f is injective.
Next we check that f is surjective. Given any (b, c) in the codomain N × R, notice
that ( 3cb , b) belongs to the domain R × N, and f ( 3cb , b) = (b, c). Thus f is surjective.
As it is both injective and surjective, it is bijective; thus the inverse exists.
To find the inverse, recall that we obtained f ( 3cb , b) = (b, c). Then f −1 f ( 3cb , b) =
f −1 ( b, c), which reduces to ( 3cb , b) = f −1 ( b, c). Replacing b and c with x and y,
respectively, we get f −1 ( x, y) = ( 3yx , x).

5. Consider a function f : A → B and a subset X ⊆ A . We observed in Section 12.6
that f −1 ( f ( X )) 6= X in general. However X ⊆ f −1 ( f ( X )) is always true. Prove this.
Proof. Suppose a ∈ X . Thus f (a) ∈ { f ( x) : x ∈ X } = f ( X ), that is f (a) ∈ f ( X ). Now, by
definition of preimage, we have f −1 ( f ( X )) = { x ∈ A : f ( x) ∈ f ( X )}. Since a ∈ A and
f (a) ∈ f ( X ), it follows that a ∈ f −1 ( f ( X )). This proves X ⊆ f −1 ( f ( X )).

7. Given a function f : A → B and subsets W, X ⊆ A , prove f (W ∩ X ) ⊆ f (W ) ∩ f ( X ).
Proof. Suppose b ∈ f (W ∩ X ). This means b ∈ { f ( x) : x ∈ W ∩ X }, that is b = f (a)
for some a ∈ W ∩ X . Since a ∈ W we have b = f (a) ∈ { f ( x) : x ∈ W } = f (W ). Since
a ∈ X we have b = f (a) ∈ { f ( x) : x ∈ X } = f ( X ). Thus b is in both f (W ) and f ( X ), so
b ∈ f (W ) ∩ f ( X ). This completes the proof that f (W ∩ X ) ⊆ f (W ) ∩ f ( X ).
■
9. Given a function f : A → B and subsets W, X ⊆ A , prove f (W ∪ X ) = f (W ) ∪ f ( X ).
Proof. First we will show f (W ∪ X ) ⊆ f (W ) ∪ f ( X ). Suppose b ∈ f (W ∪ X ). This
means b ∈ { f ( x) : x ∈ W ∪ X }, that is, b = f (a) for some a ∈ W ∪ X . Thus a ∈ W or a ∈ X .
If a ∈ W , then b = f (a) ∈ { f ( x) : x ∈ W } = f (W ). If a ∈ X , then b = f (a) ∈ { f ( x) : x ∈ X } =
f ( X ). Thus b is in f (W ) or f ( X ), so b ∈ f (W ) ∪ f ( X ). This completes the proof that
f (W ∪ X ) ⊆ f (W ) ∪ f ( X ).

Next we will show f (W ) ∪ f ( X ) ⊆ f (W ∪ X ). Suppose b ∈ f (W ) ∪ f ( X ). This means
b ∈ f (W ) or b ∈ f ( X ). If b ∈ f (W ), then b = f (a) for some a ∈ W . If b ∈ f ( X ), then
b = f (a) for some a ∈ X . Either way, b = f (a) for some a that is in W or X . That
is, b = f (a) for some a ∈ W ∪ X . But this means b ∈ f (W ∪ X ). This completes the

11. Given f : A → B and subsets Y , Z ⊆ B, prove f −1 (Y ∪ Z ) = f −1 (Y ) ∪ f −1 ( Z ).
Proof. First we will show f −1 (Y ∪ Z ) ⊆ f −1 (Y ) ∪ f −1 ( Z ). Suppose a ∈ f −1 (Y ∪ Z ). By
Definition 12.9, this means f (a) ∈ Y ∪ Z . Thus, f (a) ∈ Y or f (a) ∈ Z . If f (a) ∈ Y ,
then a ∈ f −1 (Y ), by Definition 12.9. Similarly, if f (a) ∈ Z , then a ∈ f −1 ( Z ). Hence
a ∈ f −1 (Y ) or a ∈ f −1 ( Z ), so a ∈ f −1 (Y ) ∪ f −1 ( Z ). Consequently f −1 (Y ∪ Z ) ⊆ f −1 (Y ) ∪
f −1 ( Z ).
Next we show f −1 (Y ) ∪ f −1 ( Z ) ⊆ f −1 (Y ∪ Z ). Suppose a ∈ f −1 (Y ) ∪ f −1 ( Z ). This
means a ∈ f −1 (Y ) or a ∈ f −1 ( Z ). Hence, by Definition 12.9, f (a) ∈ Y or f (a) ∈ Z ,
which means f (a) ∈ Y ∪ Z . But by Definition 12.9, f (a) ∈ Y ∪ Z means a ∈ f −1 (Y ∪ Z ).
Consequently f −1 (Y ) ∪ f −1 ( Z ) ⊆ f −1 (Y ∪ Z ).
The previous two paragraphs show f −1 (Y ∪ Z ) = f −1 (Y ) ∪ f −1 ( Z ).

If | x−3| ≤ 1, then | x+3| = |( x−3)+6| ≤ | x−3|+|6| ≤ 1+6 = 7 (using the inequality (13.2)
from page 245). So if | x − 3| ≤ 1, then | x + 3| ≤ 7 and the above equation yields

Chapter 14 Exercises
Section 14.1
1. R and (0, ∞)
Observe that the function f ( x) = e x sends R to (0, ∞). It is injective because
f ( x) = f ( y) implies e x = e y , and taking ln of both sides gives x = y. It is surjective
because if b ∈ (0, ∞), then f (ln(b)) = b. Therefore, because of the bijection f : R →
(0, ∞), it follows that |R| = |(0, ∞)|.
3. R and (0, 1)
Observe that the function π1 f ( x) = cot−1 ( x) sends R to (0, 1). It is injective and
surjective by elementary trigonometry. Therefore, because of the bijection f :
R → (0, 1), it follows that |R| = |(0, 1)|.
5. A = {3k : k ∈ Z} and B = {7k : k ∈ Z}
Observe that the function f ( x) = 73 x sends A to B. It is injective because f ( x) = f ( y)
implies 73 x = 73 y, and multiplying both sides by 37 gives x = y. It is surjective
because if b ∈ B, then b = 7 k for some integer k. Then 3k ∈ A , and f (3k) = 7k = b.
Therefore, because of the bijection f : A → B, it follows that | A | = |B|.
7. Z and S = . . . , 18 , 14 , 12 , 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .
Observe that the function f : Z → S defined as f (n) = 2n is bijective: It is injective
because f (m) = f (n) implies 2m = 2n , and taking log2 of both sides produces m = n.
It is surjective because any element b of S has form b = 2n for some integer n,
and therefore f (n) = 2n = b. Because of the bijection f : Z → S , it follows that
|Z| = |S |.

9. {0, 1} × N and N
Consider the function f : {0, 1} × N → N defined as f (a, n) = 2n − a. This is injective
because if f (a, n) = f (b, m), then 2n − a = 2m − b. Now if a were unequal to b, one of
a or b would be 0 and the other would be 1, and one side of 2 n − a = 2 m − b would
be odd and the other even, a contradiction. Therefore a = b. Then 2n − a = 2m − b
becomes 2n − a = 2m − a; add a to both sides and divide by 2 to get m = n. Thus we
have a = b and m = n, so (a, n) = (b, m), so f is injective. To see that f is surjective,
take any b ∈ N. If b is even, then b = 2n for some integer n, and f (0, n) = 2n − 0 = b.
If b is odd, then b = 2 n+1 for some integer n. Then f (1, n+1) = 2(n+1)−1 = 2n+1 = b.
Therefore f is surjective. Then f is a bijection, so |{0, 1} × N| = |N|.
11. [0, 1] and (0, 1)
Proof. Consider the subset X = n1 : n ∈ N ⊆ [0, 1]. Let f : [0, 1] → [0, 1) be defined
as f ( x) = x if x ∈ [0, 1] − X and ©f ( n1 ) = n+1 1 for
any n1 ∈ X . It is easy to check that

f is a bijection. Next let Y = 1 − n1 : n ∈ N ⊆ [0, 1), and define g : [0, 1) → (0, 1) as

1 for any 1 − n ∈ Y . As in the case of f , it
is easy to check that g is a bijection. Therefore the composition g ◦ f : [0, 1] → (0, 1)
is a bijection. (See Theorem 12.2.) We conclude that |[0, 1]| = |(0, 1)|.

1. Prove that the set A = {ln(n) : n ∈ N} ⊆ R is countably infinite.
Note that its elements can be written in infinite list form as ln(1), ln(2), ln(3), · · · .
Thus A is countably infinite.
3. Prove that the set A = {(5n, −3 n) : n ∈ Z} is countably infinite.
Consider the function f : Z → A defined as f (n) = (5n, −3n). This is clearly surjective, and it is injective because f (n) = f (m) gives (5 n, −3n) = (5 m, −3m), so 5n = 5m,
hence m = n. Thus, because f is surjective, |Z| = | A |, and | A | = |Z| = ℵ0 . Therefore
A is countably infinite.
5. Prove or disprove: There exists a countably infinite subset of the set of irrational

This is true. Just consider the set consisting of the irrational numbers π1 , π2 , π3 , π4 , · · · .
7. Prove or disprove: The set Q100 is countably infinite.
This is true. Note Q100 = Q×Q×· · ·×Q (100 times), and since Q is countably infinite,
it follows from the corollary of Theorem 14.5 that this product is countably
infinite.
9. Prove or disprove: The set {0, 1} × N is countably infinite.
This is true. Note that {0, 1} × N can be written in infinite list form as

13. If A = { X ⊂ N : X is finite}, then | A | = ℵ0 .
Proof. This is true. To show this we will describe how to arrange the items of
A in an infinite list X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 , . . ..
For each natural number n, let p n be the nth prime number. Thus p 1 = 2,
p 2 = 3, p 3 = 5, p 4 = 7, p 5 = 11, and so on. Now consider any element X ∈ A . If
X 6= ;, then X = { n 1 , n 2 , n 3 , ..., n k }, where k = | X | and n i ∈ N for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
Define a function f : A → N ∪ {0} as follows: f ({n1 , n2 , n3 , ..., n k }) = p n1 p n2 · · · p n k .
For example, f ({1, 2, 3}) = p 1 p 2 p 3 = 2 · 3 · 5 = 30, and f ({3, 5}) = p 3 p 5 = 5 · 11 = 55, etc.
Also, we should not forget that ; ∈ A , and we define f (;) = 0.
Note f : A →N∪{0} is injective: Let X = {n1 , n2 , n3 , ..., n k } and Y = {m 1 , m 2 , m 3 , ..., m ` },
and X 6= Y . Then there is an integer a that belongs to one of X or Y but not the
other. Then the prime factorization of one of the numbers f ( X ) and f (Y ) uses
the prime number p a but the prime factorization of the other does not use p a . It
follows that f ( X ) 6= f (Y ) by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Thus f is
injective.
So each set X ∈ A is associated with an integer f ( X ) ≥ 0, and no two different sets
are associated with the same number. Thus we can list the elements in X ∈ A in
increasing order of the numbers f ( X ). The list begins as
;, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {4}, {1, 3}, {5}, {6}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {7}, . . .

It follows that A is countably infinite.

Section 14.3
1. Suppose B is an uncountable set and A is a set. Given that there is a surjective
function f : A → B, what can be said about the cardinality of A ?
The set A must be uncountable, as follows. For each b ∈ B, let a b be an element
of A for which f (a b ) = b. (Such an element must exist because f is surjective.)
Now form the set U = {a b : b ∈ B}. Then the function f : U → B is bijective, by
construction. Then since B is uncountable, so is U . Therefore U is an uncountable
subset of A , so A is uncountable by Theorem 14.9.
3. Prove or disprove: If A is uncountable, then | A | = |R|.
This is false. Let A = P (R). Then A is uncountable, and by Theorem 14.7,
|R| < |P (R)| = | A |.
5. Prove or disprove: The set {0, 1} × R is uncountable.
This is true. To see why, first note that the function f : R → {0} × R defined as
f ( x) = (0, x) is a bijection. Thus |R| = |{0} × R|, and since R is uncountable, so is

{0} × R. Then {0} × R is an uncountable subset of the set {0, 1} × R, so {0, 1} × R is
uncountable by Theorem 14.9.

7. Prove or disprove: If A ⊆ B and A is countably infinite and B is uncountable,
then B − A is uncountable.
This is true. To see why, suppose to the contrary that B − A is countably infinite.
Then B = A ∪ (B − A ) is a union of countably infinite sets, and thus countable, by
Theorem 14.6. This contradicts the fact that B is uncountable.
Section 14.4
1. Show that if A ⊆ B and there is an injection g : B → A , then | A | = |B|.
Just note that the map f : A → B defined as f ( x) = x is an injection. Now apply
the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröeder theorem.
3. Let F be the set of all functions N → 0, 1}. Show that |R| = |F |.
©

Because |R| = |P (N)|, it suffices to show that |F | = |P (N)|. To do this, we will
exhibit a bijection f : F → P (N). Define f as follows. Given a function ϕ ∈ F ,
let f (ϕ) = {n ∈ N : ϕ(n) = 1}. To see that f is injective, suppose f (ϕ) = f (θ ). Then
{ n ∈ N : ϕ( n) = 1} = { n ∈ N : θ ( n) = 1}. Put X = { n ∈ N : ϕ( n) = 1}. Now we see that if
n ∈ X , then ϕ( n) = 1 = θ ( n). And if n ∈ N − X , then ϕ( n) = 0 = θ ( n). Consequently
ϕ( n) = θ ( n) for any n ∈ N, so ϕ = θ . Thus f is injective. To see that f is surjective,
take any X ∈ P (N). Consider the function ϕ ∈ F for which ϕ(n) = 1 if n ∈ X and
ϕ( n) = 0 if n ∉ X . Then f (ϕ) = X , so f is surjective.
5. Consider the subset B = ( x, y) : x2 + y2 ≤ 1 ⊆ R2 . Show that |B| = |R2 |.

This will follow from the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröeder theorem provided that we
can find injections f : B → R2 and g : R2 → B. The function f : B → R2 defined as
f ( x, y) = ( x, y) is clearly injective. For g : R2 → B, consider the function

Verify that this is an injective function g : R2 → B.
7. Prove or disprove: If there is a injection f : A → B and a surjection g : A → B, then
there is a bijection h : A → B.
This is true. Here is an outline of a proof. Define a function g0 : B → A as follows.
For each b ∈ B, choose an element xb ∈ g−1 ({ x}). (That is, choose an element xb ∈ A
for which g( xb ) = b.) Now let g0 : B → A be the function defined as g0 ( b) = xb . Check
that g0 is injective and apply the the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröeder theorem.
