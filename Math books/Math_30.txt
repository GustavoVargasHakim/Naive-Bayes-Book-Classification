Preface

This text is an outgrowth of lectures given at the University of Windsor,
Canada. One of our main objectives is updating the undergraduate analysis
as a rigorous postcalculus course. While such excellent books as Dieudonné’s
Foundations of Modern Analysis are addressed mainly to graduate students,
we try to simplify the modern Bourbaki approach to make it accessible to
sufficiently advanced undergraduates. (See, for example, §4 of Chapter 5.)
On the other hand, we endeavor not to lose contact with classical texts,
still widely in use. Thus, unlike Dieudonné, we retain the classical notion of a
derivative as a number (or vector), not a linear transformation. Linear maps
are reserved for later (Volume II) to give a modern version of differentials.
Nor do we downgrade the classical mean-value theorems (see Chapter 5, §2) or
Riemann–Stieltjes integration, but we treat the latter rigorously in Volume II,
inside Lebesgue theory. First, however, we present the modern Bourbaki theory
of antidifferentiation (Chapter 5, §5 ff.), adapted to an undergraduate course.
Metric spaces (Chapter 3, §11 ff.) are introduced cautiously, after the nspace E n , with simple diagrams in E 2 (rather than E 3 ), and many “advanced
calculus”-type exercises, along with only a few topological ideas. With some
adjustments, the instructor may even limit all to E n or E 2 (but not just to the
real line, E 1 ), postponing metric theory to Volume II. We do not hesitate to
deviate from tradition if this simplifies cumbersome formulations, unpalatable
to undergraduates. Thus we found useful some consistent, though not very
usual , conventions (see Chapter 5, §1 and the end of Chapter 4, §4), and
an early use of quantifiers (Chapter 1, §1–3), even in formulating theorems.
Contrary to some existing prejudices, quantifiers are easily grasped by students
after some exercise, and help clarify all essentials.
Several years’ class testing led us to the following conclusions:
(1) Volume I can be (and was) taught even to sophomores, though they only
gradually learn to read and state rigorous arguments. A sophomore often
does not even know how to start a proof. The main stumbling block
remains the ε, δ-procedure. As a remedy, we provide most exercises with
explicit hints, sometimes with almost complete solutions, leaving only
tiny “whys” to be answered.
(2) Motivations are good if they are brief and avoid terms not yet known.
Diagrams are good if they are simple and appeal to intuition.

Preface

(3) Flexibility is a must. One must adapt the course to the level of the class.
“Starred” sections are best deferred. (Continuity is not affected.)
(4) “Colloquial” language fails here. We try to keep the exposition rigorous
and increasingly concise, but readable.
(5) It is advisable to make the students preread each topic and prepare questions in advance, to be answered in the context of the next lecture.
(6) Some topological ideas (such as compactness in terms of open coverings)
are hard on the students. Trial and error led us to emphasize the sequential approach instead (Chapter 4, §6). “Coverings” are treated in
Chapter 4, §7 (“starred”).

(7) To students unfamiliar with elements of set theory we recommend our
Basic Concepts of Mathematics for supplementary reading. (At Windsor,
this text was used for a preparatory first-year one-semester course.) The
first two chapters and the first ten sections of Chapter 3 of the present
text are actually summaries of the corresponding topics of the author’s
Basic Concepts of Mathematics, to which we also relegate such topics as
the construction of the real number system, etc.
For many valuable suggestions and corrections we are indebted to H. Atkinson, F. Lemire, and T. Traynor. Thanks!

About the Author
Elias Zakon was born in Russia under the czar in 1908, and he was swept
along in the turbulence of the great events of twentieth-century Europe.
Zakon studied mathematics and law in Germany and Poland, and later he
joined his father’s law practice in Poland. Fleeing the approach of the German
Army in 1941, he took his family to Barnaul, Siberia, where, with the rest of
the populace, they endured five years of hardship. The Leningrad Institute of
Technology was also evacuated to Barnaul upon the siege of Leningrad, and
there he met the mathematician I. P. Natanson; with Natanson’s encouragement, Zakon again took up his studies and research in mathematics.
Zakon and his family spent the years from 1946 to 1949 in a refugee camp
in Salzburg, Austria, where he taught himself Hebrew, one of the six or seven
languages in which he became fluent. In 1949, he took his family to the newly
created state of Israel and he taught at the Technion in Haifa until 1956. In
Israel he published his first research papers in logic and analysis.
Throughout his life, Zakon maintained a love of music, art, politics, history,
law, and especially chess; it was in Israel that he achieved the rank of chess
master.
In 1956, Zakon moved to Canada. As a research fellow at the University of
Toronto, he worked with Abraham Robinson. In 1957, he joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Windsor, where the first degrees in the newly
established Honours program in Mathematics were awarded in 1960. While
at Windsor, he continued publishing his research results in logic and analysis.
In this post-McCarthy era, he often had as his house-guest the prolific and
eccentric mathematician Paul Erdős, who was then banned from the United
States for his political views. Erdős would speak at the University of Windsor,
where mathematicians from the University of Michigan and other American
universities would gather to hear him and to discuss mathematics.
While at Windsor, Zakon developed three volumes on mathematical analysis,
which were bound and distributed to students. His goal was to introduce
rigorous material as early as possible; later courses could then rely on this
material. We are publishing here the latest complete version of the second of
these volumes, which was used in a two-semester class required of all secondyear Honours Mathematics students at Windsor.

Set Theory

§§1–3. Sets and Operations on Sets. Quantifiers
A set is a collection of objects of any specified kind. Sets are usually denoted
by capitals. The objects belonging to a set are called its elements or members.
We write x ∈ A if x is a member of A, and x 6∈ A if it is not.
A = {a, b, c, . . . } means that A consists of the elements a, b, c, . . . . In
particular, A = {a, b} consists of a and b; A = {p} consists of p alone. The
empty or void set, ∅, has no elements. Equality (=) means logical identity.
If all members of A are also in B, we call A a subset of B (and B a superset
of A), and write A ⊆ B or B ⊇ A. It is an axiom that the sets A and B are
equal (A = B) if they have the same members, i.e.,
A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.
If, however, A ⊆ B but B 6⊆ A (i.e., B has some elements not in A), we call A
a proper subset of B and write A ⊂ B or B ⊃ A. “⊆” is called the inclusion
relation.
Set equality is not affected by the order in which elements appear. Thus
{a, b} = {b, a}. Not so for ordered pairs (a, b).1 For such pairs,
(a, b) = (x, y)

iff 2

a = x and b = y,

but not if a = y and b = x. Similarly, for ordered n-tuples,
(a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )

iff ak = xk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

We write {x | P (x)} for “the set of all x satisfying the condition P (x).”
Similarly, {(x, y) | P (x, y)} is the set of all ordered pairs for which P (x, y)
holds; {x ∈ A | P (x)} is the set of those x in A for which P (x) is true.

Chapter 1. Set Theory

For any sets A and B, we define their union A ∪ B, intersection A ∩ B,
difference A − B, and Cartesian product (or cross product) A × B, as follows:
A ∪ B is the set of all members of A and B taken together :
{x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.3
A ∩ B is the set of all common elements of A and B:
{x ∈ A | x ∈ B}.
A − B consists of those x ∈ A that are not in B:
{x ∈ A | x 6∈ B}.
A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y), with x ∈ A and y ∈ B:
{(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B}.
Similarly, A1 × A2 × · · · × An is the set of all ordered n-tuples (x1 , . . . , xn ) such
that xk ∈ Ak , k = 1, 2, . . . , n. We write An for A × A × · · · × A (n factors).
A and B are said to be disjoint iff A ∩ B = ∅ (no common elements).
Otherwise, we say that A meets B (A ∩ B 6= ∅). Usually all sets involved are
subsets of a “master set” S, called the space. Then we write −X for S − X,
and call −X the complement of X (in S). Various other notations are likewise
in use.
Examples.
Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {2, 4}. Then
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}, A ∩ B = {2}, A − B = {1, 3},
A × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}.

If N is the set of all naturals (positive integers), we could also write
A = {x ∈ N | x < 4}.
Theorem 1.
(a) A ∪ A = A; A ∩ A = A;

(b) A ∪ B = B ∪ A, A ∩ B = B ∩ A;

(c) (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C); (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C);

(d) (A ∪ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C);

(e) (A ∩ B) ∪ C = (A ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ C).

The word “or” is used in the inclusive sense: “P or Q” means “P or Q or both.”

§§1–3. Sets and Operations on Sets. Quantifiers

The proof of (d) is sketched in Problem 1. The rest is left to the reader.
Because of (c), we may omit brackets in A ∪ B ∪ C and A ∩ B ∩ C; similarly
for four or more sets. More generally, we may consider whole families of sets,
i.e., collections of many
S (possibly infinitely many) sets. If M is such a family,
we define its union, M, to be the set of all elements x, eachTbelonging to at
least one set of the family. The intersection of M, denoted M, consists of
those x that belong to all sets of the family simultaneously. Instead, we also
write
[
\
{X | X ∈ M} and {X | X ∈ M}, respectively.
Often we can number the sets of a given family:
A1 , A2 , . . . , An , . . . .
More generally, we may denote all sets of a family M by some letter (say, X)
with indices i attached to it (the indices may, but need not, be numbers). The
family M then is denoted by {Xi } or {Xi | i ∈ I}, where i is a variable index
ranging over a suitable set I of indices (“index notation”). In this case, the
union and intersection of M are denoted by such symbols as
[
[

{Xi | i ∈ I} =
Xi =
Xi =
Xi ;

i∈I

following are true:

(If S is the entire space, we may write −Ai for S − Ai , − Ai for S − Ai ,
etc.)
Before proving these laws, we introduce some useful notation.
Logical Quantifiers. From logic we borrow the following abbreviations.
“(∀ x ∈ A) . . . ” means “For each member x of A, it is true that . . . .”
“(∃ x ∈ A) . . . ” means “There is at least one x in A such that . . . .”

“(∃! x ∈ A) . . . ” means “There is a unique x in A such that . . . .”

Chapter 1. Set Theory

The symbols “(∀ x ∈ A)” and “(∃ x ∈ A)” are called the universal and
existential quantifiers, respectively. If confusion is ruled out, we simply write
“(∀ x),” “(∃ x),” and “(∃ ! x)” instead. For example, if we agree that m, n
denote naturals, then
“(∀ n) (∃ m) m > n”
means “For each natural n, there is a natural m such that m > n.” We give
some more examples.
S
Let M = {Ai | i ∈ I} be an indexed set family. By definition, x ∈ Ai
means that x is in at least one of the sets Ai , i ∈ I. In other words, there is at
least one index i ∈ I such that x ∈ Ai ; in symbols,
(∃ i ∈ I) x ∈ Ai .
Thus we note that

as required.
One proves part (ii) of Theorem 2 quite similarly. (Exercise!)
We shall now dwell on quantifiers more closely. Sometimes a formula P (x)
holds not for all x ∈ A, but only for those with an additional property Q(x).
This will be written as
(∀ x ∈ A | Q(x))

P (x),

5

§§1–3. Sets and Operations on Sets. Quantifiers

where the vertical stroke stands for “such that.” For example, if N is again
the naturals, then the formula
(∀ x ∈ N | x > 3)

x≥4

(1)

means “for each x ∈ N such that x > 3, it is true that x ≥ 4.” In other words,
for naturals, x > 3 =⇒ x ≥ 4 (the arrow stands for “implies”). Thus (1) can
also be written as
(∀ x ∈ N ) x > 3 =⇒ x ≥ 4.
In mathematics, we often have to form the negation of a formula that starts
with one or several quantifiers. It is noteworthy, then, that each universal
quantifier is replaced by an existential one (and vice versa), followed by the
negation of the subsequent part of the formula. For example, in calculus, a real
number p is called the limit of a sequence x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . iff the following
is true:
For every real ε > 0, there is a natural k (depending on ε) such that, for
all natural n > k, we have |xn − p| < ε.

If we agree that lower case letters (possibly with subscripts) denote real numbers, and that n, k denote naturals (n, k ∈ N ), this sentence can be written
as
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ n > k) |xn − p| < ε.
(2)
Here the expressions “(∀ ε > 0)” and “(∀ n > k)” stand for “(∀ ε | ε > 0)”
and “(∀ n | n > k)”, respectively (such self-explanatory abbreviations will also
be used in other similar cases).
Now, since (2) states that “for all ε > 0” something (i.e., the rest of (2)) is
true, the negation of (2) starts with “there is an ε > 0” (for which the rest of
the formula fails). Thus we start with “(∃ ε > 0)”, and form the negation of
what follows, i.e., of
(∃ k) (∀ n > k)

|xn − p| < ε.

This negation, in turn, starts with “(∀ k)”, etc. Step by step, we finally arrive
at
(∃ ε > 0) (∀ k) (∃ n > k) |xn − p| ≥ ε.
Note that here the choice of n > k may depend on k. To stress it, we often
write nk for n. Thus the negation of (2) finally emerges as
(∃ ε > 0) (∀ k) (∃ nk > k)

|xnk − p| ≥ ε.

(3)

The order in which the quantifiers follow each other is essential . For example, the formula
(∀ n ∈ N ) (∃ m ∈ N ) m > n

6

Chapter 1. Set Theory

(“each n ∈ N is exceeded by some m ∈ N ”) is true, but
(∃ m ∈ N ) (∀ n ∈ N ) m > n
is false. However, two consecutive universal quantifiers (or two consecutive
existential ones) may be interchanged. We briefly write
“(∀ x, y ∈ A)” for “(∀ x ∈ A) (∀ y ∈ A),”
and
“(∃ x, y ∈ A)” for “(∃ x ∈ A) (∃ y ∈ A),” etc.
We conclude with an important remark. The universal quantifier in a formula
(∀ x ∈ A) P (x)
does not imply the existence of an x for which P (x) is true. It is only meant
to imply that there is no x in A for which P (x) fails.
The latter is true even if A = ∅; we then say that “(∀ x ∈ A) P (x)” is
vacuously true. For example, the formula ∅ ⊆ B, i.e.,
(∀ x ∈ ∅)

x ∈ B,

is always true (vacuously).

§§4–7. Relations. Mappings
In §§1–3, we have already considered sets of ordered pairs, such as Cartesian
products A × B or sets of the form {(x, y) | P (x, y)} (cf. §§1–3, Problem 7).
If the pair (x, y) is an element of such a set R, we write
(x, y) ∈ R,
treating (x, y) as one thing. Note that this does not imply that x and y taken
separately are members of R (in which case we would write x, y ∈ R). We call
x, y the terms of (x, y).
In mathematics, it is customary to call any set of ordered pairs a relation.
For example, all sets listed in Problem 7 of §§1–3 are relations. Since relations
are sets, equality R = S for relations means that they consist of the same
elements (ordered pairs), i.e., that
(x, y) ∈ R ⇐⇒ (x, y) ∈ S.
If (x, y) ∈ R, we call y an R-relative of x; we also say that y is R-related
to x or that the relation R holds between x and y (in this order). Instead of
(x, y) ∈ R, we also write xRy, and often replace “R” by special symbols like
<, ∼, etc. Thus, in case (i) of Problem 7 above, “xRy” means that x < y.
Replacing all pairs (x, y) ∈ R by the inverse pairs (y, x), we obtain a new
relation, called the inverse of R and denoted R−1 . Clearly, xR−1 y iff yRx;
thus
R−1 = {(x, y) | yRx} = {(y, x) | xRy}.
4

Here we work with two set families, {Xi | i ∈ I} and {Yj | j ∈ J}; similarly in other
such cases.

9

§§4–7. Relations. Mappings

Hence R, in turn, is the inverse of R−1 ; i.e.,
(R−1 )−1 = R.
For example, the relations < and > between numbers are inverse to each other;
so also are the relations ⊆ and ⊇ between sets. (We may treat “⊆” as the name
of the set of all pairs (X, Y ) such that X ⊆ Y in a given space.)
If R contains the pairs (x, x′ ), (y, y ′ ), (z, z ′ ), . . . , we shall write

· · · ; e.g., R =

To obtain R−1 , we simply interchange the upper and lower rows in (1).
Definition 1.
The set of all left terms x of pairs (x, y) ∈ R is called the domain of R,
denoted DR . The set of all right terms of these pairs is called the range
′

In (1), DR is the upper row, and DR

DR−1 = DR

then

DR = DR
−1 = {1, 4} and DR = DR−1 = {1, 2}.

Definition 2.
The image of a set A under a relation R (briefly, the R-image of A) is the
set of all R-relatives of elements of A, denoted R[A]. The inverse image
of A under R is the image of A under the inverse relation, i.e., R−1 [A].
If A consists of a single element, A = {x}, then R[A] and R−1 [A] are also
written R[x] and R−1 [x], respectively, instead of R[{x}] and R−1 [{x}].

Then
R[1] = {1, 3, 4};

R[2] = {3, 5};

R[3] = {1, 3, 4, 5}

R−1 [3] = {1, 2, 3};

R−1 [4] = {1, 3};

R[A] = {1, 3, 4, 5};

R−1 [1] = {1, 3, 7};

R[5] = ∅;

R−1 [A] = {1, 3, 7};

R[B] = {3, 5}.

R−1 [2] = ∅;

By definition, R[x] is the set of all R-relatives of x. Thus
y ∈ R[x]

iff

(x, y) ∈ R; i.e., xRy.

More generally, y ∈ R[A] means that (x, y) ∈ R for some x ∈ A. In symbols,
y ∈ R[A] ⇐⇒ (∃ x ∈ A) (x, y) ∈ R.
Note that R[A] is always defined.
We shall now consider an especially important kind of relation.
Definition 3.
A relation R is called a mapping (map), or a function, or a transformation, iff every element x ∈ DR has a unique R-relative, so that R[x]
consists of a single element. This unique element is denoted by R(x) and
is called the function value at x (under R). Thus R(x) is the only member
of R[x].1
If, in addition, different elements of DR have different images, R is called a
one-to-one (or one-one) map. In this case,
x 6= y (x, y ∈ DR ) implies R(x) 6= R(y);
equivalently,
R(x) = R(y) implies x = y.
In other words, no two pairs belonging to R have the same left, or the same
right, terms. This shows that R is one to one iff R−1 , too, is a map.2 Mappings
are often denoted by the letters f , g, h, F , ψ, etc.

Equivalently, R is a map iff (x, y) ∈ R and (x, z) ∈ R implies that y = z. (Why?)
Note that R−1 always exists as a relation, but it need not be a map. For example,

§§4–7. Relations. Mappings

A mapping f is said to be “from A to B” iff Df = A and Df′ ⊆ B; we then
write
f: A→B

(“f maps A into B”).

If, in particular, Df = A and Df′ = B, we call f a map of A onto B, and we
write
f : A −→ B

(“f maps A onto B”).

onto

If f is both onto and one to one, we write
f : A ←→ B
onto

(f : A ←→ B means that f is one to one).
All pairs belonging to a mapping f have the form (x, f (x)) where f (x) is
the function value at x, i.e., the unique f -relative of x, x ∈ Df . Therefore, in
order to define some function f , it suffices to specify its domain Df and the
function value f (x) for each x ∈ Df . We shall often use such definitions. It is
customary to say that f is defined on A (or “f is a function on A”) iff A = Df .
Examples.
(a) The relation
R = {(x, y) | x is the wife of y}
is a one-to-one map of the set of all wives onto the set of all husbands.
′
) onto
R−1 is here a one-to-one map of the set of of all husbands (= DR
the set of all wives (= DR ).
(b) The relation
f = {(x, y) | y is the father of x}
is a map of the set of all people onto the set of their fathers. It is not one
to one since several persons may have the same father (f -relative), and
so x 6= x′ does not imply f (x) 6= f (x′ ).
(c) Let
g=



.

Then g is a map of Dg = {1, 2, 3, 4} onto Dg′ = {2, 3, 8}, with
g(1) = 2, g(2) = 2, g(3) = 3, g(4) = 8.
(As noted above, these formulas may serve to define g.) It is not one to
one since g(1) = g(2), so g −1 is not a map.

12

Chapter 1. Set Theory

(d) Consider
f : N → N , with f (x) = 2x for each x ∈ N .3
By what was said above, f is well defined. It is one to one since x 6= y
implies 2x 6= 2y. Here Df = N (the naturals), but Df′ consists of even
naturals only. Thus f is not onto N (it is onto a smaller set, the even
naturals); f −1 maps the even naturals onto all of N .
The domain and range of a relation may be quite arbitrary sets. In particular, we can consider functions f in which each element of the domain Df is
itself an ordered pair (x, y) or n-tuple (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ). Such mappings are
called functions of two (respectively, n) variables. To any n-tuple (x1 , . . . , xn )
that belongs to Df , the function f assigns a unique function value, denoted by
f (x1 , . . . , xn ). It is convenient to regard x1 , x2 , . . . , xn as certain variables;
then the function value, too, becomes a variable depending on the x1 , . . . , xn .
Often Df consists of all ordered n-tuples of elements taken from a set A,
i.e., Df = An (cross-product of n sets, each equal to A). The range may
be an arbitrary set B; so f : An → B. Similarly, f : A × B → C is a function
of two variables, with Df = A × B, Df′ ⊆ C.
Functions of two variables are also called (binary) operations. For example,
addition of natural numbers may be treated as a map f : N × N → N , with
f (x, y) = x + y.
Definition 4.
A relation R is said to be
(i) reflexive iff we have xRx for each x ∈ DR ;

(ii) symmetric iff xRy always implies yRx;

(iii) transitive iff xRy combined with yRz always implies xRz.
R is called an equivalence relation on a set A iff A = DR and R has all the
three properties (i), (ii), and (iii). For example, such is the equality relation on
A (also called the identity map on A) denoted
IA = {(x, y) | x ∈ A, x = y}.
Equivalence relations are often denoted by special symbols resembling equality,
such as ≡, ≈, ∼, etc. The formula xRy, where R is such a symbol, is read
“x is equivalent (or R-equivalent) to y,”
3

This is often abbreviated by saying “consider the function f (x) = 2x on N .” However,
one should remember that f (x) is actually not the function f (a set of ordered pairs) but
only a single element of the range of f . A better expression is “f is the map x → 2x on N ”
or “f carries x into 2x (x ∈ N ).”

13

§§4–7. Relations. Mappings

and R[x] = {y | xRy} (i.e., the R-image of x) is called the R-equivalence class
(briefly R-class) of x in A; it consists of all elements that are R-equivalent to
x and hence to each other (for xRy and xRz imply first yRx, by symmetry,
and hence yRz, by transitivity). Each such element is called a representative
of the given R-class, or its generator . We often write [x] for R[x].
Examples.
(a′ ) The inequality relation < between real numbers is transitive since
x < y and y < z implies x < z;
it is neither reflexive nor symmetric. (Why?)
(b′ ) The inclusion relation ⊆ between sets is reflexive (for A ⊆ A) and transitive (for A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C implies A ⊆ C), but it is not symmetric.

(c′ ) The membership relation ∈ between an element and a set is neither reflexive nor symmetric nor transitive (x ∈ A and A ∈ M does not imply
x ∈ M).

(d′ ) Let R be the parallelism relation between lines in a plane, i.e., the set of
all pairs (X, Y ), where X and Y are parallel lines. Writing k for R, we
have X k X, X k Y implies Y k X, and (X k Y and Y k Z) implies
X k Z, so R is an equivalence relation. An R-class here consists of all
lines parallel to a given line in the plane.
(e′ ) Congruence of triangles is an equivalence relation. (Why?)
Theorem 1. If R (also written ≡) is an equivalence relation on A, then all
R-classes are disjoint from each other, and A is their union.
Proof. Take two R-classes, [p] =
6 [q]. Seeking a contradiction, suppose they
are not disjoint, so
(∃ x) x ∈ [p] and x ∈ [q];
i.e., p ≡ x ≡ q and hence p ≡ q. But then, by symmetry and transitivity,
y ∈ [p] ⇔ y ≡ p ⇔ y ≡ q ⇔ y ∈ [q];
i.e., [p] and [q] consist of the same elements y, contrary to assumption [p] 6= [q].
Thus, indeed, any two (distinct) R-classes are disjoint.
Also, by reflexivity,
(∀ x ∈ A) x ≡ x,
i.e., x ∈ [x]. Thus each x ∈ A is in some R-class (namely, in [x]); so all of A is
in the union of such classes,

Instead of u(n) we usually write un (“index notation”), and call un the nth
term of the sequence. If n is treated as a variable, un is called the general term
of the sequence, and {un } is used to denote the entire (infinite) sequence, as
well as its range Du′ (whichever is meant, will be clear from the context). The
formula {un } ⊆ B means that Du′ ⊆ B, i.e., that u is a sequence in B. To
determine a sequence, it suffices to define its general term un by some formula
or rule.2 In (1) above, un = 2n.
Often we omit the mention of Du = N (since it is known) and give only the
range Du′ . Thus instead of (1), we briefly write
2, 4, 6, . . . , 2n, . . .
or, more generally,
u1 , u 2 , . . . , un , . . . .
Yet it should be remembered that u is a set of pairs (a map).
If all un are distinct (different from each other), u is a one-to-one map. However, this need not be the case. It may even occur that all un are equal (then u
is said to be constant); e.g., un = 1 yields the sequence 1, 1, 1, . . . , 1, . . . , i.e.,


1 2 3 ... n ...
.
(2)
u=
1 1 1 ... 1 ...
Note that here u is an infinite sequence (since Du = N ), even though its
range Du′ has only one element, Du′ = {1}. (In sets, repeated terms count
as one element; but the sequence u consists of infinitely many distinct pairs
(n, 1).) If all un are real numbers, we call u a real sequence. For such sequences,
we have the following definitions.
2

However, such a formula may not exist; the un may even be chosen “at random.”

§8. Sequences

Definition 1.
A real sequence {un } is said to be monotone (or monotonic) iff it is either
nondecreasing, i.e.,
(∀ n) un ≤ un+1 ,
or nonincreasing, i.e.,
(∀ n)

un ≥ un+1 .

Notation: {un }↑ and {un }↓, respectively. If instead we have the strict
inequalities un < un+1 (respectively, un > un+1 ), we call {un } strictly
monotone (increasing or decreasing).
A similar definition applies to sequences of sets.
Definition 2.
A sequence of sets A1 , A2 , . . . , An , . . . is said to be monotone iff it is
either expanding, i.e.,
(∀ n)

An ⊆ An+1 ,

(∀ n)

An ⊇ An+1 .

or contracting, i.e.,
Notation: {An }↑ and {An }↓, respectively. For example, any sequence of
concentric solid spheres (treated as sets of points), with increasing radii,
is expanding; if the radii decrease, we obtain a contracting sequence.
Definition 3.
Let {un } be any sequence, and let
n1 < n2 < · · · < nk < · · ·
be a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers. Select from {un }
those terms whose subscripts are n1 , n2 , . . . , nk , . . . . Then the sequence
{unk } so selected (with kth term equal to unk ), is called the subsequence
of {un }, determined by the subscripts nk , k = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Thus (roughly) a subsequence is any sequence obtained from {un } by dropping some terms, without changing the order of the remaining terms (this is
ensured by the inequalities n1 < n2 < · · · < nk < · · · where the nk are the
subscripts of the remaining terms). For example, let us select from (1) the
subsequence of terms whose subscripts are primes (including 1). Then the
subsequence is
2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 22, . . . ,
i.e.,
u1 , u2 , u3 , u5 , u7 , u11 , . . . .

18

Chapter 1. Set Theory

All these definitions apply to finite sequences accordingly. Observe that
every sequence arises by “numbering” the elements of its range (the terms): u1
is the first term, u2 is the second term, and so on. By so numbering, we put
the terms in a certain order , determined by their subscripts 1, 2, 3, . . . (like
the numbering of buildings in a street, of books in a library, etc.). The question
now arises: Given a set A, is it always possible to “number” its elements by
integers? As we shall see in §9, this is not always the case. This leads us to
the following definition.
Definition 4.
A set A is said to be countable iff A is contained in the range of some
sequence (briefly, the elements of A can be put in a sequence).
If, in particular, this sequence can be chosen finite, we call A a finite
set. (The empty set is finite.)
Sets that are not finite are said to be infinite.
Sets that are not countable are said to be uncountable.
Note that all finite sets are countable. The simplest example of an infinite
countable set is N = {1, 2, 3, . . . }.

§9. Some Theorems on Countable Sets1
We now derive some corollaries of Definition 4 in §8.

Corollary 1. If a set A is countable or finite, so is any subset B ⊆ A.
For if A ⊂ Du′ for a sequence u, then certainly B ⊆ A ⊆ Du′ .

Corollary 2. If A is uncountable (or just infinite), so is any superset B ⊇ A.
For, if B were countable or finite, so would be A ⊆ B, by Corollary 1.

Theorem 1. If A and B are countable, so is their cross product A × B.

Proof. If A or B is ∅, then A × B = ∅, and there is nothing to prove.
Thus let A and B be nonvoid and countable. We may assume that they fill
two infinite sequences, A = {an }, B = {bn } (repeat terms if necessary). Then,
by definition, A × B is the set of all ordered pairs of the form
(an , bm ),

n, m ∈ N.

Call n + m the rank of the pair (an , bm ). For each r ∈ N , there are r − 1 pairs
of rank r:
(a1 , br−1 ), (a2 , br−2 ), . . . , (ar−1 , b1 ).
(1)
1

This section may be deferred until Chapter 5, §4.

19

§9. Some Theorems on Countable Sets

We now put all pairs (an , bm ) in one sequence as follows. We start with
(a1 , b1 )
as the first term; then take the two pairs of rank three,
(a1 , b2 ), (a2 , b1 );
then the three pairs of rank four, and so on. At the (r − 1)st step, we take all
pairs of rank r, in the order indicated in (1).
Repeating this process for all ranks ad infinitum, we obtain the sequence of
pairs
(a1 , b1 ), (a1 , b2 ), (a2 , b1 ), (a1 , b3 ), (a2 , b2 ), (a3 , b1 ), . . . ,
in which u1 = (a1 , b1 ), u2 = (a1 , b2 ), etc.
By construction, this sequence contains all pairs of all ranks r, hence all pairs
that form the set A × B (for every such pair has some rank r and so it must
eventually occur in the sequence). Thus A × B can be put in a sequence. 
Corollary 3. The set R of all rational numbers 2 is countable.

Proof. Consider first the set Q of all positive rationals, i.e.,
n
fractions , with n, m ∈ N .
m
We may formally identify them with ordered pairs (n, m), i.e., with N × N .
We call n + m the rank of (n, m). As in Theorem 1, we obtain the sequence
1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4
, , , , , , , , , , ....
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 3 2 1
By dropping reducible fractions and inserting also 0 and the negative rationals,
we put R into the sequence
0, 1, −1,

1
1
1
1
, − , 2, −2, , − , 3, −3, . . . , as required. 

Theorem 2. The union of any sequence {An } of countable sets is countable.
Proof. As each An is countable, we may put

An = {an1 , an2 , . . . , anm , . . . }.
(The double subscripts are to distinguish the sequences representing different
S
sets An .) As before, we may assume that all sequences are infinite. Now, n An
obviously consists of the elements of all An combined , i.e., all anm (n, m ∈ N ).
We call n + m the rank of anm and proceed as in Theorem 1, thus obtaining
[
An = {a11 , a12 , a21 , a13 , a22 , a31 , . . . }.
n

A number is rational iff it is the ratio of two integers, p/q, q 6= 0.

20

Chapter 1. Set Theory

Thus

S

n

An can be put in a sequence. 

Note 1. Theorem 2 is briefly expressed as
“Any countable union of countable sets is a countable set.”
(The term“countable union” means “union of a countable family of sets”, i.e., a
family of sets whose elements can be put in a sequence {An }.) In particular,
if A and B are countable, so are A ∪ B, A ∩ B, and A − B (by Corollary 1).

Note 2. From the proof it also follows that the range of any double sequence {anm } is countable. (A double sequence is a function u whose domain
Du is N × N ; say, u : N × N → B. If n, m ∈ N , we write unm for u(n, m);
here unm = anm .)
To prove the existence of uncountable sets, we shall now show that the
interval
[0, 1) = {x | 0 ≤ x < 1}
of the real axis is uncountable.
We assume as known the fact that each real number x ∈ [0, 1) has a unique
infinite decimal expansion
0.x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . ,
where the xn are the decimal digits (possibly zeros), and the sequence {xn }
does not terminate in nines (this ensures uniqueness).3
Theorem 3. The interval [0, 1) of the real axis is uncountable.
Proof. We must show that no sequence can comprise all of [0, 1). Indeed,
given any {un }, write each term un as an infinite decimal fraction; say,
un = 0.an1 , an2 , . . . , anm , . . . .
Next, construct a new decimal fraction
z = 0.x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . . ,
choosing its digits xn as follows.
If ann (i.e., the nth digit of un ) is 0, put xn = 1; if, however, ann 6= 0, put
xn = 0. Thus, in all cases, xn 6= ann , i.e., z differs from each un in at least one
decimal digit (namely, the nth digit). It follows that z is different from all un
and hence is not in {un }, even though z ∈ [0, 1).
Thus, no matter what the choice of {un } was, we found some z ∈ [0, 1) not
in the range of that sequence. Hence no {un } contains all of [0, 1). 
Note 3. By Corollary 2, any superset of [0, 1), e.g., the entire real axis, is
uncountable. See also Problem 4 below.
3

For example, instead of 0.49999 . . . , we write 0.50000 . . . .

21

§9. Some Theorems on Countable Sets

Note 4. Observe that the numbers ann used in the proof of Theorem 3 form
the diagonal of the infinitely extending square composed of all anm . Therefore,
the method used above is called the diagonal process (due to G. Cantor).

Problems on Countable and Uncountable Sets
1. Prove that if A is countable but B is not, then B − A is uncountable.
[Hint: If B − A were countable, so would be

(B − A) ∪ A ⊇ B.

(Why?)

Use Corollary 1.]

2. Let f be a mapping, and A ⊆ Df . Prove that
(i) if A is countable, so is f [A];
(ii) if f is one to one and A is uncountable, so is f [A].
[Hints: (i) If A = {un }, then
f [A] = {f (u1 ), f (u2 ), . . . , f (un ), . . . }.
(ii) If f [A] were countable, so would be f −1 [f [A]], by (i). Verify that
f −1 [f [A]] = A
here; cf. Problem 7 in §§4–7.]

3. Let a, b be real numbers (a < b). Define a map f on [0, 1) by
f (x) = a + x(b − a).
Show that f is one to one and onto the interval [a, b) = {x | a ≤ x < b}.
From Problem 2, deduce that [a, b) is uncountable. Hence, by Problem
1, so is (a, b) = {x | a < x < b}.

4. Show that between any real numbers a, b (a < b) there are uncountably
many irrationals, i.e., numbers that are not rational.
[Hint: By Corollary 3 and Problems 1 and 3, the set (a, b) − R is uncountable.
Explain in detail.]

5. Show that every infinite set A contains a countably infinite set, i.e., an
infinite sequence of distinct terms.
[Hint: Fix any a1 ∈ A; A cannot consist of a1 alone, so there is another element
a2 ∈ A − {a1 }.

(Why?)

Again, A 6= {a1 , a2 }, so there is an a3 ∈ A − {a1 , a2 }. (Why?) Continue thusly ad
infinitum to obtain the required sequence {an }. Why are all an distinct?]
∗

6. From Problem 5, prove that if A is infinite, there is a map f : A → A
that is one to one but not onto A.
[Hint: With an as in Problem 5, define f (an ) = an+1 . If, however, x is none of the
an , put f (x) = x. Observe that f (x) = a1 is never true, so f is not onto A. Show,
however, that f is one to one.]

22

Chapter 1. Set Theory
∗

7. Conversely (cf. Problem 6), prove that if there is a map f : A → A that
is one to one but not onto A, then A contains an infinite sequence {an }
of distinct terms.
[Hint: As f is not onto A, there is a1 ∈ A such that a1 ∈
/ f [A]. (Why?) Fix a1 and
define
a2 = f (a1 ), a3 = f (a2 ), . . . , an+1 = f (an ), . . . ad infinitum.
To prove distinctness, show that each an is distinct from all am with m > n. For a1 ,
this is true since a1 ∈
/ f [A], whereas am ∈ f [A] (m > 1). Then proceed inductively.]

Real Numbers. Fields

§§1–4. Axioms and Basic Definitions
Real numbers can be constructed step by step: first the integers, then the
rationals, and finally the irrationals.1 Here, however, we shall assume the
set of all real numbers, denoted E 1 , as already given, without attempting to
reduce this notion to simpler concepts. We shall also accept without definition
(as primitive concepts) the notions of the sum (a + b) and the product, (a · b)
or (ab), of two real numbers, as well as the inequality relation < (read “less
than”). Note that x ∈ E 1 means “x is in E 1 ,” i.e., “x is a real number .”
It is an important fact that all arithmetic properties of reals can be deduced
from several simple axioms, listed (and named) below.

Axioms of Addition and Multiplication
I (closure laws). The sum x + y, and the product xy, of any real numbers
are real numbers themselves. In symbols,
(∀ x, y ∈ E 1 )

(x + y) ∈ E 1 and (xy) ∈ E 1 .

II (commutative laws).
(∀ x, y ∈ E 1 )

x + y = y + x and xy = yx.

III (associative laws).
(∀ x, y, z ∈ E 1 )

(x + y) + z = x + (y + z) and (xy)z = x(yz).

IV (existence of neutral elements).
(a) There is a (unique) real number , called zero (0), such that, for all
real x, x + 0 = x.
1

See the author’s Basic Concepts of Mathematics, Chapter 2, §15.

24

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

(b) There is a (unique) real number , called one (1), such that 1 6= 0
and , for all real x, x · 1 = x.

In symbols,

(a) (∃! 0 ∈ E 1 ) (∀ x ∈ E 1 )

(b) (∃! 1 ∈ E 1 ) (∀ x ∈ E 1 )

x + 0 = x;
x · 1 = x, 1 6= 0.

(The real numbers 0 and 1 are called the neutral elements of addition and
multiplication, respectively.)
V (existence of inverse elements).
(a) For every real x, there is a (unique) real , denoted −x, such that
x + (−x) = 0.
(b) For every real x other than 0, there is a (unique) real , denoted x−1 ,
such that x · x−1 = 1.

In symbols,

(a) (∀ x ∈ E 1 ) (∃! −x ∈ E 1 )

x + (−x) = 0;

(b) (∀ x ∈ E 1 | x 6= 0) (∃! x−1 ∈ E 1 )

xx−1 = 1.

(The real numbers −x and x−1 are called, respectively, the additive inverse (or the symmetric) and the multiplicative inverse (or the reciprocal )
of x.)
VI (distributive law).
(∀ x, y, z ∈ E 1 ) (x + y)z = xz + yz.

Axioms of Order
VII (trichotomy). For any real x and y, we have
either x < y or y < x or x = y
but never two of these relations together .
VIII (transitivity).
(∀ x, y, z ∈ E 1 ) x < y and y < z implies x < z.
IX (monotonicity of addition and multiplication). For any x, y, z ∈ E 1 , we
have
(a) x < y implies x + z < y + z;
(b) x < y and z > 0 implies xz < yz.
An additional axiom will be stated in §§8–9.

§§1–4. Axioms and Basic Definitions

25

Note 1. The uniqueness assertions in Axioms IV and V are actually redundant since they can be deduced from other axioms. We shall not dwell on
this.
Note 2. Zero has no reciprocal ; i.e., for no x is 0x = 1. In fact, 0x = 0.
For, by Axioms VI and IV,
0x + 0x = (0 + 0)x = 0x = 0x + 0.
Cancelling 0x (i.e., adding −0x on both sides), we obtain 0x = 0, by Axioms III
and V(a).
Note 3. Due to Axioms VII and VIII, real numbers may be regarded as
given in a certain order under which smaller numbers precede the larger ones.
(This is why we speak of “axioms of order .”) The ordering of real numbers can
be visualized by “plotting” them as points on a directed line (“the real axis”)
in a well-known manner. Therefore, E 1 is also often called “the real axis,” and
real numbers are called “points”; we say “the point x” instead of “the number
x.”
Observe that the axioms only state certain properties of real numbers without
specifying what these numbers are. Thus we may treat the reals as just any
mathematical objects satisfying our axioms, but otherwise arbitrary. Indeed,
our theory also applies to any other set of objects (numbers or not), provided
they satisfy our axioms with respect to a certain relation of order (<) and
certain operations (+) and (·), which may, but need not, be ordinary addition
and multiplication. Such sets exist indeed. We now give them a name.
Definition 1.
A field is any set F of objects, with two operations (+) and (·) defined
in it in such a manner that they satisfy Axioms I–VI listed above (with
E 1 replaced by F , of course).
If F is also endowed with a relation < satisfying Axioms VII to IX, we
call F an ordered field .
In this connection, postulates I to IX are called axioms of an (ordered ) field .
By Definition 1, E 1 is an ordered field. Clearly, whatever follows from the
axioms must hold not only in E 1 but also in any other ordered field. Thus
we shall henceforth state our definitions and theorems in a more general way,
speaking of ordered fields in general instead of E 1 alone.
Definition 2.
An element x of an ordered field is said to be positive if x > 0 or negative
if x < 0.
Here and below, “x > y” means the same as “y < x.” We also write
“x ≤ y” for “x < y or x = y”; similarly for “x ≥ y.”

26

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

Definition 3.
For any elements x, y of a field, we define their difference
x − y = x + (−y).
If y 6= 0, we also define the quotient of x by y
x
= xy −1 ,
y
also denoted by x/y.
Note 4. Division by 0 remains undefined .
Definition 4.
For any element x of an ordered field, we define its absolute value,

x
if x ≥ 0 and
|x| =
−x if x < 0.
It follows that |x| ≥ 0 always; for if x ≥ 0, then
|x| = x ≥ 0;
and if x < 0, then
|x| = −x > 0. (Why?)
Moreover,
−|x| ≤ x ≤ |x|,
for,
if x ≥ 0, then |x| = x;
and
if x < 0, then x < |x| since |x| > 0.
Thus, in all cases,
x ≤ |x|.
Similarly one shows that
−|x| ≤ x.
As we have noted, all rules of arithmetic (dealing with the four arithmetic
operations and inequalities) can be deduced from Axioms I through IX and
thus apply to all ordered fields, along with E 1 . We shall not dwell on their
deduction, limiting ourselves to a few simple corollaries as examples.2
2

For more examples, see the author’s Basic Concepts of Mathematics, Chapter 2, §§3–4.

27

§§1–4. Axioms and Basic Definitions

Corollary 1 (rule of signs).
(i) a(−b) = (−a)b = −(ab);
(ii) (−a)(−b) = ab.

Proof. By Axiom VI,
a(−b) + ab = a[(−b) + b] = a · 0 = 0.
Thus
a(−b) + ab = 0.
By definition, then, a(−b) is the additive inverse of ab, i.e.,
a(−b) = −(ab).
Similarly, we show that
(−a)b = −(ab)
and that
−(−a) = a.
Finally, (ii) is obtained from (i) when a is replaced by −a.



Corollary 2. In an ordered field , a 6= 0 implies
(Hence 1 = 12 > 0.)

a2 = (a · a) > 0.

Proof. If a > 0, we may multiply by a (Axiom IX(b)) to obtain
a · a > 0 · a = 0, i.e., a2 > 0.
If a < 0, then −a > 0; so we may multiply the inequality a < 0 by −a and
obtain
a(−a) < 0(−a) = 0;
i.e., by Corollary 1,
−a2 < 0,
whence
a2 > 0. 

§§5–6. Natural Numbers. Induction
The element 1 was introduced in Axiom IV(b). Since addition is also assumed
known, we can use it to define, step by step, the elements
2 = 1 + 1, 3 = 2 + 1, 4 = 3 + 1, etc.

28

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

If this process is continued indefinitely, we obtain what is called the set N of
all natural elements in the given field F . In particular, the natural elements of
E 1 are called natural numbers. Note that
(∀ n ∈ N ) n + 1 ∈ N.
∗

A more precise approach to natural elements is as follows.1 A subset S of
a field F is said to be inductive iff
(i) 1 ∈ S and

(ii) (∀ x ∈ S) x + 1 ∈ S.

Such subsets certainly exist; e.g., the entire field F is inductive since
1 ∈ F and (∀ x ∈ F ) x + 1 ∈ F.
Define N as the intersection of all inductive sets in F .
∗

Theorem 1. The set N so defined is inductive itself . In fact, it is the “smallest” inductive subset of F (i .e., contained in any other such subset).
Proof. We have to show that
(i) 1 ∈ N , and

(ii) (∀ x ∈ N ) x + 1 ∈ N .

Now, by definition, the unity 1 is in each inductive set; hence it also belongs
to the intersection of such sets, i.e., to N . Thus 1 ∈ N , as claimed.
Next, take any x ∈ N . Then, by our definition of N , x is in each inductive
set S; thus, by property (ii) of such sets, also x + 1 is in each such S; hence
x + 1 is in the intersection of all inductive sets, i.e.,
x + 1 ∈ N,
and so N is inductive, indeed.
Finally, by definition, N is the common part of all such sets and hence
contained in each. 
For applications, Theorem 1 is usually expressed as follows.
Theorem 1′ (first induction law). A proposition P (n) involving a natural n
holds for all n ∈ N in a field F if
(i) it holds for n = 1, i .e., P (1) is true; and

(ii) whenever P (n) holds for n = m, it holds for n = m + 1, i .e.,
P (m) =⇒ P (m + 1).
1

At a first reading, one may omit all “starred” passages and simply assume Theorems 1′
and 2′ below as additional axioms, without proof.

29

§§5–6. Natural Numbers. Induction
∗

Proof. Let S be the set of all those n ∈ N for which P (n) is true,
S = {n ∈ N | P (n)}.

We have to show that actually each n ∈ N is in S, i.e., N ⊆ S.
First, we show that S is inductive.
Indeed, by assumption (i), P (1) is true; so 1 ∈ S.
Next, let x ∈ S. This means that P (x) is true. By assumption (ii), however,
this implies P (x + 1), i.e., x + 1 ∈ S. Thus
1 ∈ S and (∀ x ∈ S) x + 1 ∈ S;
S is inductive.
Then, by Theorem 1 (second clause), N ⊆ S, and all is proved. 
This theorem is used to prove various properties of N “by induction.”
Examples.
(a) If m, n ∈ N , then also m + n ∈ N and mn ∈ N .
To prove the first property, fix any m ∈ N . Let P (n) mean
m+n∈N

(n ∈ N ).

Then
(i) P (1) is true, for as m ∈ N , the definition of N yields m + 1 ∈ N ,
i.e., P (1).
(ii) P (k) ⇒ P (k + 1) for k ∈ N . Indeed,
P (k) ⇒ m + k ∈ N ⇒ (m + k) + 1 ∈ N
⇒ m + (k + 1) ∈ N ⇒ P (k + 1).

Thus, by Theorem 1′ , P (n) holds for all n; i.e.,
(∀ n ∈ N )

m+n∈N

for any m ∈ N .
To prove the same for mn, we let P (n) mean
mn ∈ N

(n ∈ N )

and proceed similarly.
(b) If n ∈ N , then n − 1 = 0 or n − 1 ∈ N .
For an inductive proof, let P (n) mean
n − 1 = 0 or n − 1 ∈ N
Then proceed as in (a).

(n ∈ N ).

30

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

(c) In an ordered field , all naturals are ≥ 1.
Indeed, let P (n) mean that
n ≥ 1 (n ∈ N ).
Then
(i) P (1) holds since 1 = 1.
(ii) P (m) ⇒ P (m + 1) for m ∈ N , since
P (m) ⇒ m ≥ 1 ⇒ (m + 1) > 1 ⇒ P (m + 1).
Thus Theorem 1′ yields the result.
(d) In an ordered field , m, n ∈ N and m > n implies m − n ∈ N .
For an inductive proof, fix any m ∈ N and let P (n) mean
m − n ≤ 0 or m − n ∈ N

(n ∈ N ).

Use (b).
(e) In an ordered field , m, n ∈ N and m < n + 1 implies m ≤ n.
For, by (d), m > n would imply m − n ∈ N , hence m − n ≥ 1, or
m ≥ n + 1, contrary to m < n + 1.

Our next theorem states the so-called well-ordering property of N .

Theorem 2 (well-ordering of N ). In an ordered field , each nonvoid set A ⊆ N
has a least member (i .e., one that exceeds no other element of A).
Proof outline.2 Given ∅ =
6 A ⊆ N , let P (n) be the proposition “Any subset
of A containing elements ≤ n has a least member ” (n ∈ N ). Use Theorem 1′
and Example (e). 
This theorem yields a new form of the induction law.
Theorem 2′ (second induction law). A proposition P (n) holds for all n ∈ N
in an ordered field if
(i′ ) P (1) holds and
(ii′ ) whenever P (n) holds for all naturals less than some m ∈ N , then P (n)
also holds for n = m.
Proof. Assume (i′ ) and (ii′ ). Seeking a contradiction,3 suppose there are some
n ∈ N (call them “bad”) for which P (n) fails. Then these “bad” naturals form
a nonvoid subset of N , call it A.
2

For a more detailed proof, see Basic Concepts of Mathematics, Chapter 2, §5, Theorem 2.
3 We are using a “proof by contradiction” or “indirect proof.” Instead of proving our
assertion directly, we show that the opposite is impossible, being contradictory.

§§5–6. Natural Numbers. Induction

31

By Theorem 2, A has a least member m. Thus m is the least natural for
which P (n) fails. It follows that all n less than m do satisfy P (n). But then,
by our assumption (ii′ ), P (n) also holds for n = m, which is impossible for, by
construction, m is “bad” (it is in A). This contradiction shows that there are
no “bad” naturals. Thus all is proved. 
Note 1. All the preceding arguments hold also if, in our definition of N
and all formulations, the unity 1 is replaced by 0 or by some k (±k ∈ N ).
Then, however, the conclusions must be changed to say that P (n) holds for all
integers n ≥ k (instead of “n ≥ 1”). We then say that “induction starts with
k.”
An analogous induction law also applies to definitions of concepts C(n).
A notion C(n) involving a natural n is regarded as defined for each n ∈ N
(in E 1 ) if
(i) it is defined for n = 1 and
(ii) some rule is given that expresses C(n + 1) in terms of C(1), . . . , C(n).
(Note 1 applies here, too.)
C(n) itself need not be a number ; it may be of quite general nature.
We shall adopt this principle as a kind of logical axiom, without proof
(though it can be proved in a similar manner as Theorems 1′ and 2′ ). The underlying intuitive idea is a “step-by-step” process—first, we define C(1); then,
as C(1) is known, we may use it to define C(2); next, once both are known,
we may use them to define C(3); and so on, ad infinitum. Definitions based
on that principle are called inductive or recursive. The following examples are
important.
Examples (continued).
(f) For any element x of a field, we define its nth power xn and its n-multiple
nx by
(i) x1 = 1x = x;
(ii) xn+1 = xn x (respectively, (n + 1)x = nx + x).
We may think of it as a step-by-step definition:
x1 = x, x2 = x1 x, x3 = x2 x, etc.
(g) For each natural number n, we define its factorial n! by
1! = 1, (n + 1)! = n! (n + 1);
e.g., 2! = 1! (2) = 2, 3! = 2! (3) = 6, etc. We also define 0! = 1.

§7. Integers and Rationals
All natural elements of a field F , their additive inverses, and 0 are called the
integral elements of F , briefly integers.
p
An element x ∈ F is said to be rational iff x = for some integers p and q
q
(q 6= 0); x is irrational iff it is not rational.
We denote by J the set of all integers, and by R the set of all rationals, in
F . Every integer p is also a rational since p can be written as p/q with q = 1.
Thus
R ⊇ J ⊃ N.

35

§7. Integers and Rationals

In an ordered field,
N = {x ∈ J | x > 0}. (Why?)
Theorem 1. If a and b are integers (or rationals) in F , so are a + b and ab.
Proof. For integers, this follows from Examples (a) and (d) in §§5–6; one only
has to distinguish three cases:
(i) a, b ∈ N ;

(ii) −a ∈ N , b ∈ N ;

(iii) a ∈ N , −b ∈ N .

The details are left to the reader (see Basic Concepts of Mathematics, Chapter 2, §7, Theorem 1).
Now let a and b be rationals, say,
p
r
a = and b = ,
q
s
where p, q, r, s ∈ J and q, s 6= 0. Then, as is easily seen,
a±b=

pr
ps ± qr
and ab =
,
qs
qs

where qs 6= 0; and qs and pr are integers by the first part of the proof (since
p, q, r, s ∈ J).
Thus a ± b and ab are fractions with integral numerators and denominators.
Hence, by definition, a ± b ∈ R and ab ∈ R. 
Theorem 2. In any field F , the set R of all rationals is a field itself , under
the operations defined in F , with the same neutral elements 0 and 1. Moreover ,
R is an ordered field if F is. (We call R the rational subfield of F .)
Proof. We have to check that R satisfies the field axioms.
The closure law I follows from Theorem 1.
Axioms II, III, and VI hold for rationals because they hold for all elements
of F ; similarly for Axioms VII to IX if F is ordered.
Axiom IV holds in R because the neutral elements 0 and 1 belong to R;
indeed, they are integers, hence certainly rationals.
To verify Axiom V, we must show that −x and x−1 belong to R if x does.
If, however,
p
x=
(p, q ∈ J, q 6= 0),
q
then
−x =

−p
,
q

where again −p ∈ J by the definition of J; thus −x ∈ R.

36

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

If, in addition, x 6= 0, then p 6= 0, and
q
p
x = implies x−1 = . (Why?)

Thus x−1 ∈ R.



Note. The representation
x=

p
q

(p, q ∈ J)

is not unique in general; in an ordered field, however, we can always choose
q > 0, i.e., q ∈ N (take p ≤ 0 if x ≤ 0).
Among all such q there is a least one by Theorem 2 of §§5–6. If x = p/q,
with this minimal q ∈ N , we say that the rational x is given in lowest terms.

§§8–9. Upper and Lower Bounds. Completeness Axiom
A subset A of an ordered field F is said to be bounded below (or left bounded )
iff there is p ∈ F such that
(∀ x ∈ A)

p ≤ x;

A is bounded above (or right bounded ) iff there is q ∈ F such that
(∀ x ∈ A)

x ≤ q.

In this case, p and q are called, respectively, a lower (or left) bound and an
upper (or right) bound, of A. If both exist, we simply say that A is bounded
(by p and q). The empty set ∅ is regarded as (“vacuously”) bounded by any p
and q (cf. the end of Chapter 1, §3).
The bounds p and q may, but need not, belong to A. If a left bound p
is itself in A, we call it the least element or minimum of A, denoted min A.
Similarly, if A contains an upper bound q, we write q = max A and call q the
largest element or maximum of A. However, A may well have no minimum or
maximum.
Note 1. A finite set A 6= ∅ always has a minimum and a maximum
(see Problem 9 of §§5–6).

Note 2. A set A can have at most one maximum and at most one minimum.
For if it had two maxima q, q ′ , then
q ≤ q′
(since q ∈ A and q ′ is a right bound); similarly
q ′ ≤ q;

37

§§8–9. Upper and Lower Bounds. Completeness Axiom

so q = q ′ after all. Uniqueness of min A is proved in the same manner.
Note 3. If A has one lower bound p, it has many (e.g., take any p′ < p).
Similarly, if A has one upper bound q, it has many (take any q ′ > q).
Geometrically, on the real axis, all lower (upper) bounds lie to the left (right)
of A; see Figure 1.

Examples.
(1) Let
A = {1, −2, 7}.
Then A is bounded above (e.g., by 7, 8, 10, . . . ) and below (e.g., by
−2, −5, −12, . . . ).
We have min A = −2, max A = 7.

(2) The set N of all naturals is bounded below (e.g., by 1, 0, 12 , −1, . . . ),
and 1 = min N ; N has no maximum, for each q ∈ N is exceeded by some
n ∈ N (e.g., n = q + 1).
(3) Given a, b ∈ F (a ≤ b), we define in F the open interval
(a, b) = {x | a < x < b};
the closed interval
[a, b] = {x | a ≤ x ≤ b};
the half-open interval
(a, b] = {x | a < x ≤ b};
and the half-closed interval
[a, b) = {x | a ≤ x < b}.
Clearly, each of these intervals is bounded by the endpoints a and b;
moreover, a ∈ [a, b] and a ∈ [a, b) (the latter provided [a, b) 6= ∅, i.e., a <
b), and a = min[a, b] = min[a, b); similarly, b = max[a, b] = max(a, b].
But [a, b) has no maximum, (a, b] has no minimum, and (a, b) has neither.
(Why?)
Geometrically, it seems plausible that among all left and right bounds of A
(if any) there are some “ closest” to A, such as u and v in Figure 1, i.e., a least

38

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

upper bound v and a greatest lower bound u. These are abbreviated
lub A and glb A
and are also called the supremum and infimum of A, respectively; briefly,
v = sup A, u = inf A.
However, this assertion, though valid in E 1 , fails to materialize in many
other fields such as the field R of all rationals (cf. §§11–12). Even for E 1 , it
cannot be proved from Axioms I through IX.
On the other hand, this property is of utmost importance for mathematical
analysis; so we introduce it as an axiom (for E 1 ), called the completeness
axiom. It is convenient first to give a general definition.
Definition 1.
An ordered field F is said to be complete iff every nonvoid right-bounded
subset A ⊂ F has a supremum (i.e., a lub) in F .
Note that we use the term “complete” only for ordered fields.
With this definition, we can give the tenth and final axiom for E 1 .
X (completeness axiom). The real field E 1 is complete in the above sense.
That is, each right-bounded set A ⊂ E 1 has a supremum (sup A) in E 1 ,
provided A 6= ∅.
The corresponding assertion for infima can now be proved as a theorem.

Theorem 1. In a complete field F (such as E 1 ), every nonvoid left-bounded
subset A ⊂ F has an infimum (i .e., a glb).

Proof. Let B be the (nonvoid) set of all lower bounds of A (such bounds exist
since A is left bounded). Then, clearly, no member of B exceeds any member
of A, and so B is right bounded by an element of A. Hence, by the assumed
completeness of F , B has a supremum in F , call it p.
We shall show that p is also the required infimum of A, thus completing the
proof.
Indeed, we have
(i) p is a lower bound of A. For, by definition, p is the least upper bound of
B. But, as shown above, each x ∈ A is an upper bound of B. Thus
(∀ x ∈ A)

p ≤ x.

(ii) p is the greatest lower bound of A. For p = sup B is not exceeded by any
member of B. But, by definition, B contains all lower bounds of A; so p
is not exceeded by any of them, i.e.,
p = glb A = inf A.



39

§§8–9. Upper and Lower Bounds. Completeness Axiom

Note 4. The lub and glb of A (if they exist) are unique. For inf A is,
by definition, the maximum of the set B of all lower bounds of A, and hence
unique, by Note 2; similarly for the uniqueness of sup A.
Note 5. Unlike min A and max A, the glb and lub of A need not belong to
A. For example, if A is the interval (a, b) in E 1 (a < b) then, as is easily seen,
a = inf A and b = sup A,
though a, b ∈
/ A. Thus sup A and inf A may exist, though max A and min A do
not.
On the other hand, if
q = max A (p = min A),
then also
q = sup A (p = inf A).

(Why?)

Theorem 2. In an ordered field F , we have q = sup A (A ⊂ F ) iff
(i) (∀ x ∈ A)

x ≤ q and

(ii) each field element p < q is exceeded by some x ∈ A; i .e.,
(∀ p < q) (∃ x ∈ A)

p < x.

Equivalently,
(ii′ )

(∀ ε > 0) (∃ x ∈ A)

Similarly, p = inf A iff
(∀ x ∈ A)

p≤x

and

q − ε < x;

(ε ∈ F ).

(∀ ε > 0) (∃ x ∈ A)

p + ε > x.

Proof. Condition (i) states that q is an upper bound of A, while (ii) implies
that no smaller element p is such a bound (since it is exceeded by some x in
A). When combined, (i) and (ii) state that q is the least upper bound.
Moreover, any element p < q can be written as q − ε (ε > 0). Hence (ii) can
be rephrased as (ii′ ).
The proof for inf A is quite analogous. 
Corollary 1. Let b ∈ F and A ⊂ F in an ordered field F . If each element
x of A satisfies x ≤ b (x ≥ b), so does sup A (inf A, respectively), provided it
exists in F .
In fact, the condition
(∀ x ∈ A)

x≤b

means that b is a right bound of A. However, sup A is the least right bound,
so sup A ≤ b; similarly for inf A.

40

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

Corollary 2. In any ordered field , ∅ =
6 A ⊆ B implies
sup A ≤ sup B and inf A ≥ inf B,
as well as
inf A ≤ sup A,
provided the suprema and infima involved exist.
Proof. Let p = inf B and q = sup B.
As q is a right bound of B,
x ≤ q for all x ∈ B.
But A ⊆ B, so B contains all elements of A. Thus
x ∈ A ⇒ x ∈ B ⇒ x ≤ q;
so, by Corollary 1, also
sup A ≤ q = sup B,
as claimed.
Similarly, one gets inf A ≥ inf B.
Finally, if A 6= ∅, we can fix some x ∈ A. Then
inf A ≤ x ≤ sup A,
and all is proved. 

§10. Some Consequences of the Completeness Axiom
The ancient Greek geometer and scientist Archimedes was first to observe that
even a large distance y can be measured by a small yardstick x; one only has
to mark x off sufficiently many times. Mathematically, this means that, given
any x > 0 and any y, there is an n ∈ N such that nx > y. This fact, known as
the Archimedean property, holds not only in E 1 but also in many other ordered
fields. Such fields are called Archimedean. In particular, we have the following
theorem.
Theorem 1. Any complete field F (e.g., E 1 ) is Archimedean.1
That is, given any x, y ∈ F (x > 0) in such a field , there is a natural n ∈ F
such that nx > y.
Proof by contradiction. Suppose this fails. Thus, given y, x ∈ F (x > 0),
assume that there is no n ∈ N with nx > y.
Then
(∀ n ∈ N ) nx ≤ y;
i.e., y is an upper bound of the set of all products nx (n ∈ N ). Let
A = {nx | n ∈ N }.
Clearly, A is bounded above (by y) and A 6= ∅; so, by the assumed completeness of F , A has a supremum, say, q = sup A.
As q is an upper bound, we have (by the definition of A) that nx ≤ q for all
n ∈ N , hence also (n + 1)x ≤ q; i.e.,
nx ≤ q − x
for all n ∈ N (since n ∈ N ⇒ n + 1 ∈ N ).
1

However, there also are incomplete Archimedean fields (see Note 2 in §§11–12).

44

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

Thus q − x (which is less than q for x > 0) is another upper bound of all nx,
i.e., of the set A.
This is impossible, however, since q = sup A is the least upper bound of A.
This contradiction completes the proof. 
Corollary 1. In any Archimedean (hence also in any complete) field F , the
set N of all natural elements has no upper bounds, and the set J of all integers
has neither upper nor lower bounds. Thus
(∀ y ∈ F ) (∃ m, n ∈ N )

− m < y < n.

Proof. Given any y ∈ F , one can use the Archimedean property (with x = 1)
to find an n ∈ N such that
n · 1 > y, i.e., n > y.
Similarly, there is an m ∈ N such that
m > −y, i.e., −m < y.
This proves our last assertion and shows that no y ∈ F can be a right bound
of N (for y < n ∈ N ), or a left bound of J (for y > −m ∈ J). 
Theorem 2. In any Archimedean (hence also in any complete) field F , each
left (right) bounded set A of integers (∅ =
6 A ⊂ J) has a minimum (maximum,
respectively).
Proof. Suppose ∅ =
6 A ⊆ J, and A has a lower bound y.
Then Corollary 1 (last part) yields a natural m, with −m < y, so that
(∀ x ∈ A)

− m < x,

and so x + m > 0.
Thus, by adding m to each x ∈ A, we obtain a set (call it A+m) of naturals.2
Now, by Theorem 2 of §§5–6, A + m has a minimum; call it p. As p is the
least of all sums x + m, p − m is the least of all x ∈ A; so p − m = min A exists,
as claimed.
Next, let A have a right bound z. Then look at the set of all additive inverses
−x of points x ∈ A; call it B.
Clearly, B is left bounded (by −z), so it has a minimum, say, u = min B.
Then −u = max A. (Verify!) 
In particular, given any x ∈ F (F Archimedean), let [x] denote the greatest integer ≤ x (called the integral part of x). We thus obtain the following
corollary.
2

This is the main point—geometrically, we have “shifted” A to the right by m, so that
its elements became positive integers: A + m ⊆ N .

§10. Some Consequences of the Completeness Axiom

Corollary 2. Any element x of an Archimedean field F has an integral part
[x]. It is the unique integer n such that
n ≤ x < n + 1.
(It exists, by Theorem 2.)
Any ordered field has the so-called density property:
If a < b in F , there is x ∈ F such that a < x < b; e.g., take
x=

a+b
.
2

We shall now show that, in Archimedean fields, x can be chosen rational ,
even if a and b are not. We refer to this as the density of rationals in an
Archimedean field.
Theorem 3 (density of rationals). Between any elements a and b (a < b) of
an Archimedean field F (such as E 1 ), there is a rational r ∈ F with
a < r < b.
Proof. Let p = [a] (the integral part of a). The idea of the proof is to start
with p and to mark off a small “yardstick”
1
<b−a
n
several (m) times, until
p+

lands inside (a, b);

then r = p + m
n is the desired rational.
We now make it precise. As F is Archimedean, there are m, n ∈ N such
that
1
n(b − a) > 1 and m

We fix the least such m (it exists, by Theorem 2 in §§5–6). Then

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

we find
a < r < a + b − a = b. 
Note. Having found one rational r1 ,
a < r1 < b,
we can apply Theorem 3 to find another r2 ∈ R,
r1 < r2 < b,
then a third r3 ∈ R,

r2 < r3 < b,

and so on. Continuing this process indefinitely, we obtain infinitely many
rationals in (a, b).

§§11–12. Powers With Arbitrary Real Exponents. Irrationals
In complete fields, one can define ar for any a > 0 and r ∈ E 1 (for r ∈ N , see
§§5–6, Example (f)). First of all, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Given a ≥ 0 in a complete field F , and a natural number n ∈ E 1 ,
there always is a unique element p ∈ F , p ≥ 0, such that
pn = a.
It is called the nth root of a, denoted
√
n
a or a1/n .
√
(Note that n a ≥ 0, by definition.)

A direct proof, from the completeness axiom, is sketched in Problems 1 and
2 below. We shall give a simpler proof in Chapter 4, §9, Example (a). At
present, we omit it and temporarily take Theorem 1 for granted. Hence we
obtain the following result.
Theorem 2. Every complete field F (such as E 1 ) has irrational elements,
i .e., elements that are not rational .
√
In particular , 2 is irrational .1
Proof. By Theorem 1, F has the element
√
p = 2 with p2 = 2.
1

As usual, we write

√
√
a for 2 a.

§§11–12. Powers With Arbitrary Real Exponents. Irrationals

Seeking a contradiction, suppose

47

√

2 is rational, i.e.,
√
m
2=
n

for some m, n ∈ N in lowest terms (see §7, final note).
Then m and n are not√both even (otherwise, reduction by 2 would yield a
smaller n). From m/n = 2, we obtain
m2 = 2n2 ;
so m2 is even.
Only even elements have even squares, however.2 Thus m itself must be
even; i.e., m = 2r for some r ∈ N . It follows that
4r 2 = m2 = 2n2 , i.e., 2r 2 = n2
and, by the same argument, n must be even.
This contradicts √
the fact that m and n are not both even, and this contradiction shows that 2 must be irrational. 
√
Note 1. Similarly, one can prove the irrationality of a where a ∈ N and
a is not the square of a natural. See Problem 3 below for a hint.
Note 2. Theorem 2 shows that the field R of all rationals is not complete (for it contains no irrationals), even though it is Archimedean (see Problem 6). Thus the Archimedean property does not imply completeness (but see
Theorem 1 of §10).
Next, we define ar for any rational number r > 0.
Definition 1.
Given a ≥ 0 in a complete field F , and a rational number
m
r=
(m, n ∈ N ⊆ E 1 ),
n
we define
ar =

√
n

am .

Here we must clarify two facts.
(1) If n = 1, we have
ar = am/1 =
2

√
1

am = am .

For if m is odd, then m = 2q − 1 for some q ∈ N , and hence
m2 = (2q − 1)2 = 4q 2 − 4q + 1 = 4q(q − 1) + 1

is an odd number.

48

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

If m = 1, we get
ar = a1/n =

√
n

a.

Thus Definition 1 agrees with our previous definitions of am and
(m, n ∈ N ).

√
n

a

(2) If r is written as a fraction in two different ways,
p
m
= ,
r=
n
q
then, as is easily seen,
√
n

am =

√
q

ap = ar ,

and so our definition is unambiguous (independent of the particular representation of r).
Indeed,
m
p
= implies mq = np,
n
q
whence
amq = apn ,
i.e.,
(am )q = (ap )n ;
cf. §§5–6, Problem 6.
By definition, however,
√
√
( n am )n = am and ( q ap )q = ap .
Substituting this in (am )q = (ap )n , we get
√
√
( n am )nq = ( q ap )nq ,
whence

√
n

am =

√
q

ap .

Thus Definition 1 is valid, indeed.
By using the results of Problems 4 and 6 of §§5–6, the reader will easily
obtain analogous formulas for powers with positive rational exponents, namely,
ar as = ar+s ; (ar )s = ars ; (ab)r = ar br ; ar < as if 0 < a < 1 and r > s;
a < b iff ar < br (a, b, r > 0); ar > as if a > 1 and r > s; 1r = 1

(1)

Henceforth we assume these formulas known, for rational r, s > 0.
Next, we define ar for any real r > 0 and any element a > 1 in a complete
field F .

49

§§11–12. Powers With Arbitrary Real Exponents. Irrationals

Let Aar denote the set of all members of F of the form ax , with x ∈ R and
0 < x ≤ r; i.e.,
Aar = {ax | 0 < x ≤ r, x rational}.
By the density of rationals in E 1 (Theorem 3 of §10), such rationals x do exist;
thus Aar 6= ∅.
Moreover, Aar is right bounded in F . Indeed, fix any rational number y > r.
By the formulas in (1), we have, for any positive rational x ≤ r,
ay = ax+(y−x) = ax ay−x > ax
since a > 1 and y − x > 0 implies
ay−x > 1.
Thus ay is an upper bound of all ax in Aar .
Hence, by the assumed completeness of F , sup Aar exists. So we may define
ar = sup Aar .3
We also put
a−r =
If 0 < a < 1 (so that

 1 −r
1
r
and a−r = r ,
a =

a
 1 r
a

= sup A1/a,r ,

as above.
Summing up, we have the following definitions.
Definition 2.
Given a > 0 in a complete field F , and r ∈ E 1 , we define the following.
(i) If r > 0 and a > 1, then

ar = sup Aar = sup{ax | 0 < x ≤ r, x rational}.
(ii) If r > 0 and 0 < a < 1, then ar =

1
(1/a)r ,

also written (1/a)−r .

(iii) a−r = 1/ar . (This defines powers with negative exponents as well.)
3

Note that, if r is a positive rational itself, then ar is the largest ax with x ≤ r (where ar
and ax are as in Definition 1); thus ar = max Aar = sup Aar , and so our present definition
agrees with Definition 1. This excludes ambiguities.

50

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

We also define 0r = 0 for any real r > 0, and a0 = 1 for any a ∈ F , a 6= 0;
00 remains undefined .
The power a√r is also defined if a < 0 and r is a rational m
n with n odd
because ar = n am has sense in this case. (Why?) This does not work for
other values of r. Therefore, in general, we assume a > 0.
Again, it is easy to show that the formulas in (1) remain also valid for powers
with real exponents (see Problems 8–13 below), provided F is complete.

Problems on Roots, Powers, and Irrationals
The problems marked by ⇒ are theoretically important. Study them!
1. Let n ∈ N in E 1 ; let p > 0 and a > 0 be elements of an ordered field F .
Prove that
(i) if pn > a, then (∃ x ∈ F ) p > x > 0 and xn > a;

(ii) if pn < a, then (∃ x ∈ F ) x > p and xn < a.
[Hint: For (i), put
x = p − d, with 0 < d < p.

Use the Bernoulli inequality (Problem 5(ii) in §§5–6) to find d such that
xn = (p − d)n > a,

2. Prove Theorem 1 assuming that
(i) a > 1;
(ii) 0 < a < 1 (the cases a = 0 and a = 1 are trivial).
[Hints: (i) Let
A = {x ∈ F | x ≥ 1, xn > a}.
Show that A is bounded below (by 1) and A 6= ∅ (e.g., a + 1 ∈ A—why?).
By completeness, put p = inf A.
√
Then show that pn = a (i.e., p is the required n a).
Indeed, if pn > a, then Problem 1 would yield an x ∈ A with
x < p = inf A. (Contradiction!)

51

§§11–12. Powers With Arbitrary Real Exponents. Irrationals
Similarly, use Problem 1 to exclude pn < a.
To prove uniqueness, use Problem 4(ii) of §§5–6.
Case (ii) reduces to (i) by considering 1/a instead of a.]

3. Prove Note 1.
[Hint: Suppose first that a is not divisible by any square of a prime, i.e.,
a = p1 p2 · · · pm ,
where the pk are distinct primes. (We assume it known that each a ∈ N is the
product of [possibly repeating] primes.) Then proceed as in the proof of Theorem 2,
replacing “even” by “divisible by pk .”
√
√
The general case, a = p2 b, reduces to the previous case since a = p b.]

4. Prove that if r is rational and q is not, then r ± q is irrational; so also
are rq, q/r, and r/q if r 6= 0.
[Hint: Assume the opposite and find a contradiction.]

⇒5. Prove the density of irrationals in a complete field F : If a < b (a, b ∈ F ),
there is an irrational x ∈ F with
a<x<b
(hence infinitely many such irrationals x).

Put x = r/ 2; see Problem 4].

See also Chapter 1, §9,

a 2 < r < b 2, r 6= 0. (Why?)

[Hint: If
x=

(k, m, p, q ∈ N ),

then nx > y for n = mp + 1].

7. Verify the formulas in (1) for powers with positive rational exponents
r, s.
8. Prove that
(i) ar+s = ar as and
(ii) ar−s = ar /as for r, s ∈ E 1 and a ∈ F (a > 0).4
[Hints: For (i), if r, s > 0 and a > 1, use Problem 9 in §§8–9 to get
ar as = sup Aar sup Aas = sup(Aar Aas ).
4

In Problems 8–13, F is assumed complete. In a later chapter, we shall prove the formulas
in (1) more simply. Thus the reader may as well omit their present verification. The problems
are, however, useful as exercises.

52

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields
Verify that
Aar Aas = {ax ay | x, y ∈ R, 0 < x ≤ r, 0 < y ≤ s}
= {az | z ∈ R, 0 < z ≤ r + s} = Aa, r+s .

Hence deduce that
ar as = sup(Aa, r+s ) = ar+s
by Definition 2.
For (ii), if r > s > 0 and a > 1, then by (i),
ar−s as = ar ;
so
ar−s =

For the cases r < 0 or s < 0, or 0 < a < 1, use the above results and Definition 2(ii)(iii).]

9. From Definition 2 prove that if r > 0 (r ∈ E 1 ), then
a > 1 ⇐⇒ ar > 1
for a ∈ F (a > 0).

10. Prove for r, s ∈ E 1 that

(i) r < s ⇔ ar < as if a > 1;

(ii) r < s ⇔ ar > as if 0 < a < 1.
[Hints: (i) By Problems 8 and 9,
as = ar+(s−r) = ar as−r > ar
since as−r > 1 if a > 1 and s − r > 0.
(ii) For the case 0 < a < 1, use Definition 2(ii).]

13. Prove that
(ar )s = ars
for r, s ∈ E 1 and a ∈ F (a > 0).

[Hint: First let r, s > 0 and a > 1. To show that
(ar )s = ars = sup Aa, rs = sup{axy | x, y ∈ R, 0 < xy ≤ rs},
use Problem 13 in §§8–9. Thus prove that

(i) (∀ x, y ∈ R | 0 < xy ≤ rs) axy ≤ (ar )s , which is easy, and

(ii) (∀ d > 1) (∃ x, y ∈ R | 0 < xy ≤ rs) (ar )s < daxy .

Fix any d > 1 and put b = ar . Then

(ar )s = bs = sup Abs = sup{by | y ∈ R, 0 < y ≤ s}.
Hence there is some y ∈ R, 0 < y ≤ s such that
1

(ar )s < d 2 (ar )y .

(Why?)

Fix that y. Now
ar = sup Aar = sup{ax | x ∈ R, 0 < x ≤ r};
so
(∃ x ∈ R | 0 < x ≤ r)

1

ar < d 2y ax .

(Why?)

Combining all and using the formulas in (1) for rationals x, y, obtain

(ar )s < d 2 (ar )y < d 2 (d 2y ax )y = daxy ,
thus proving (ii)].

§13. The Infinities. Upper and Lower Limits of Sequences
I. The Infinities. As we have seen, a set A 6= ∅ in E 1 has a lub (glb) if A
is bounded above (respectively, below), but not otherwise.
In order to avoid this inconvenient restriction, we now add to E 1 two new
objects of arbitrary nature, and call them “minus infinity” (−∞) and “plus
infinity” (+∞), with the convention that −∞ < +∞ and −∞ < x < +∞ for
all x ∈ E 1 .
It is readily seen that with this convention, the laws of transitivity and
trichotomy (Axioms VII and VIII) remain valid.
The set consisting of all reals and the two infinities is called the extended
real number system. We denote it by E ∗ and call its elements extended real
numbers. The ordinary reals are also called finite numbers, while ±∞ are the
only two infinite elements of E ∗ . (Caution: They are not real numbers.)
At this stage we do not define any operations involving ±∞. (This will
be done later.) However, the notions of upper and lower bound, maximum,

54

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

minimum, supremum, and infimum are defined in E ∗ exactly as in E 1 . In
particular,
−∞ = min E ∗ and + ∞ = max E ∗ .
Thus in E ∗ all sets are bounded .
It follows that in E ∗ every set A 6= ∅ has a lub and a glb. For if A has none
in E 1 , it still has the upper bound +∞ in E ∗ , which in this case is the unique
(hence also the least) upper bound; thus sup A = +∞.1 Similarly, inf A = −∞
if there is no other lower bound.2 As is readily seen, all properties of lub and glb
stated in §§8–9 remain valid in E ∗ (with the same proof). The only exception
is Theorem 2(ii′ ) in the case q = +∞ (respectively, p = −∞) since +∞ − ε
and −∞ + ε make no sense. Part (ii) of Theorem 2 is valid.
We can now define intervals in E ∗ exactly as in E 1 (§§8–9, Example (3)),
allowing also infinite values of a, b, x. For example,
(−∞, a) = {x ∈ E ∗ | −∞ < x < a} = {x ∈ E 1 | x < a};

(a, +∞) = {x ∈ E 1 | a < x};

(−∞, +∞) = {x ∈ E ∗ | −∞ < x < +∞} = E 1 ;
[−∞, +∞] = {x ∈ E ∗ | −∞ ≤ x ≤ +∞}; etc.

Intervals with finite endpoints are said to be finite; all other intervals are called
infinite. The infinite intervals
(−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, +∞), [a, +∞),

a ∈ E1,

are actually subsets of E 1 , as is (−∞, +∞). Thus we shall speak of infinite
intervals in E 1 as well.
II. Upper and Lower Limits.3 In Chapter 1, §§1–3 we already mentioned
that a real number p is called the limit of a sequence {xn } ⊆ E 1 (p = lim xn )
iff
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ n > k)

|xn − p| < ε, i.e., p − ε < xn < p + ε,

(1)

where ε ∈ E 1 and n, k ∈ N .
This may be stated as follows:
For sufficiently large n (n > k), xn becomes and stays as close to p as we
like (“ε-close”).
1

This is true unless A consists of −∞ alone, in which case sup A = −∞.
It is also customary to define sup ∅ = −∞ and inf ∅ = +∞. This is the only case where
sup A < inf A.
3 This topic may be deferred until Chapter 3, §14. It presupposes Chapter 1, §8.
2

55

§13. The Infinities. Upper and Lower Limits of Sequences

We also define (in E 1 and E ∗ )
lim xn = +∞ ⇐⇒ (∀ a ∈ E 1 ) (∃ k) (∀ n > k)

xn > a and

(2)

lim xn = −∞ ⇐⇒ (∀ b ∈ E 1 ) (∃ k) (∀ n > k)

xn < b.

(3)

n→∞

n→∞

Note that (2) and (3) make sense in E 1 , too, since the symbols ±∞ do not
occur on the right side of the formulas. Formula (2) means that xn becomes
arbitrarily large (larger than any a ∈ E 1 given in advance) for sufficiently large
n (n > k). The interpretation of (3) is analogous. A more general and unified
approach will now be developed for E ∗ (allowing infinite terms xn , too).
Let {xn } be any sequence in E ∗ . For each n, let An be the set of all terms
from xn onward , i.e.,
{xn , xn+1 , . . . }.
For example,
A1 = {x1 , x2 , . . . }, A2 = {x2 , x3 , . . . }, etc.
The An form a contracting sequence (see Chapter 1, §8) since
A1 ⊇ A2 ⊇ · · · .
Now, for each n, let
pn = inf An and qn = sup An ,
also denoted
pn = inf xk and qn = sup xk .
k≥n

k≥n

(These infima and suprema always exist in E ∗ , as noted above.) Since An ⊇
An+1 , Corollary 2 of §§8–9 yields
inf An ≤ inf An+1 ≤ sup An+1 ≤ sup An .
Thus
p1 ≤ p2 ≤ · · · ≤ pn ≤ pn+1 ≤ · · · ≤ qn+1 ≤ qn ≤ · · · ≤ q2 ≤ q1 ,

(4)

and so {pn }↑, while {qn }↓ in E ∗ . We also see that each qm is an upper bound
of all pn and hence
qm ≥ sup pn (= lub of all pn ).
n

This, in turn, shows that this sup (call it L) is a lower bound of all qm , and so
L ≤ inf qm .
m

We put
inf qm = L.
m

56

Chapter 2. Real Numbers. Fields

For each sequence {xn } ⊆ E ∗ , we define its upper limit L and its lower
limit L, denoted

as follows.
We put (∀ n)

Since all pn are 0, so is L = supn pn . Thus here L = L = 0.

Theorem 1.
(i) If xn ≥ b for infinitely many n, then
lim xn ≥ b

as well .

(ii) If xn ≤ a for all but finitely many n,4 then
lim xn ≤ a

as well .

Similarly for lower limits (with all inequalities reversed ).
Proof.
(i) If xn ≥ b for infinitely many n, then such n must occur in each set
Am = {xm , xm+1 , . . . }.
Hence
(∀ m)

qm = sup Am ≥ b;

so L = inf qm ≥ b, by Corollary 1 of §§8–9.
m

(ii) If xn ≤ a except finitely many n, let n0 be the last of these “exceptional”
values of n.
Then for n > n0 , xn ≤ a, i.e., the set
An = {xn , xn+1 , . . . }
4

In other words, for all except (at most) a finite number of terms xn . This is stronger
than just “infinitely many n” (allowing infinitely many exceptions as well). Caution: Avoid
confusing “all but finitely many” with just “infinitely many.”

is bounded above by a; so
(∀ n > n0 )
Hence certainly L = inf qn ≤ a.

qn = sup An ≤ a.

Corollary 2.
(i) If lim xn > a, then xn > a for infinitely many n.
(ii) If lim xn < b, then xn < b for all but finitely many n.
Similarly for lower limits (with all inequalities reversed ).
Proof. Assume the opposite and find a contradiction to Theorem 1. 
To unify our definitions, we now introduce some useful notions.
By a neighborhood of p, briefly Gp ,5 we mean, for p ∈ E 1 , any interval of
the form
(p − ε, p + ε), ε > 0.
If p = +∞ (respectively, p = −∞), Gp is an infinite interval of the form
(a, +∞] (respectively, [−∞, b)), with a, b ∈ E 1 .
We can now combine formulas (1)–(3) into one equivalent definition.
Definition 2.
An element p ∈ E ∗ (finite or not) is called the limit of a sequence {xn } in
E ∗ iff each Gp (no matter how small it is) contains all but finitely many
xn , i.e. all xn from some xk onward. In symbols,
(∀ Gp ) (∃ k) (∀ n > k)

xn ∈ G p .

(5)

We shall use the notation
p = lim xn or lim xn .
n→∞

Indeed, if p ∈ E 1 , then xn ∈ Gp means
p − ε < xn < p + ε,
as in (1). If, however, p = ±∞, it means
xn > a (respectively, xn < b),
as in (2) and (3).

This terminology and notation anticipates some more general ideas in Chapter 3, §11.

Theorem 2. We have q = lim xn in E ∗ iff
(i′ ) each neighborhood Gq contains xn for infinitely many n, and
(ii′ ) if q < b, then xn ≥ b for at most finitely many n.6
Proof. If q = lim xn , Corollary 2 yields (ii′ ).
It also shows that any interval (a, b), with a < q < b, contains infinitely
many xn (for there are infinitely many xn > a, and only finitely many xn ≥ b,
by (ii′ )).
Now if q ∈ E 1 ,
Gq = (q − ε, q + ε)
is such an interval, so we obtain (i′ ). The cases q = ±∞ are analogous; we
leave them to the reader.
Conversely, assume (i′ ) and (ii′ ).
Seeking a contradiction, let q < L; say,
q < b < lim xn .
Then Corollary 2(i) yields xn > b for infinitely many n, contrary to our assumption (ii′ ).
Similarly, q > lim xn would contradict (i′ ).
Thus necessarily q = lim xn . 
Theorem 3. We have q = lim xn in E ∗ iff
lim xn = lim xn = q.
Proof. Suppose
lim xn = lim xn = q.
If q ∈ E 1 , then every Gq is an interval (a, b), a < q < b; therefore, Corollary 2(ii) and its analogue for lim xn imply (with q treated as both lim xn and
lim xn ) that
a < xn < b for all but finitely many n.
Thus by Definition 2, q = lim xn , as claimed.
Conversely, if so, then any Gq (no matter how small) contains all but finitely
many xn . Hence so does any interval (a, b) with a < q < b, for it contains some
small Gq .
Now, exactly as in the proof of Theorem 2, one excludes
q 6= lim xn and q 6= lim xn .

This settles the case q ∈ E 1 . The cases q = ±∞ are quite analogous. 

A similar theorem (with all inequalities reversed) holds for lim xn .

Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

§§1–3. The Euclidean n-Space, E n
By definition, the Euclidean n-space E n is the set of all possible ordered ntuples of real numbers, i.e., the Cartesian product
E 1 × E 1 × · · · × E 1 (n times).
In particular, E 2 = E 1 × E 1 = {(x, y) | x, y ∈ E 1 },
E 3 = E 1 × E 1 × E 1 = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z ∈ E 1 },
and so on. E 1 itself is a special case of E n (n = 1).
In a familiar way, pairs (x, y) can be plotted as points of the xy-plane, or
as “vectors” (directed line segments) joining (0, 0) to such points. Therefore,
the pairs (x, y) themselves are called points or vectors in E 2 ; similarly for E 3 .
In E n (n > 3), there is no actual geometric representation, but it is convenient to use geometric language in this case, too. Thus any ordered n-tuple
(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) of real numbers will also be called a point or vector in E n , and
the single numbers x1 , x2 , . . . , xn are called its coordinates or components. A
point in E n is often denoted by a single letter (preferably with a bar or an
arrow above it), and then its n components are denoted by the same letter,
with subscripts (but without the bar or arrow). For example,
x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ), ~u = (u1 , . . . , un ), etc.;
x̄ = (0, −1, 2, 4) is a point (vector) in E 4 with coordinates 0, −1, 2, and 4
(in this order). The formula x̄ ∈ E n means that x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ) is a point
(vector) in E n . Since such “points” are ordered n-tuples, x̄ and ȳ are equal
(x̄ = ȳ) iff the corresponding coordinates are the same, i.e., x1 = y1 , x2 = y2 ,
. . . , xn = yn (see Problem 1 below).
The point whose coordinates are all 0 is called the zero-vector or the origin,
denoted ~0 or 0̄. The vector whose kth component is 1, and the other components

64

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

are 0, is called the kth basic unit vector , denoted ~ek . There are exactly n such
vectors,
~e1 = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0), ~e2 = (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , ~en = (0, . . . , 0, 1).
In E 3 , we often write ī, j̄, and k̄ for ~e1 , ~e2 , ~e3 , and (x, y, z) for (x1 , x2 , x3 ).
Similarly in E 2 . Single real numbers are called scalars (as opposed to vectors).
Definitions.
Given x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and ȳ = (y1 , . . . , yn ) in E n , we define the following.
1. The sum of x̄ and ȳ,
x̄ + ȳ = (x1 + y1 , x2 + y2 , . . . , xn + yn ) (hence x̄ + 0̄ = x̄).1
2. The dot product, or inner product, of x̄ and ȳ,
x̄ · ȳ = x1 y1 + x2 y2 + · · · + xn yn .
3. The distance between x̄ and ȳ,
p
ρ(x̄, ȳ) = (x1 − y1 )2 + (x2 − y2 )2 + · · · + (xn − yn )2 .
4. The absolute value, or length, of x̄,
q
√
|x̄| = x21 + x22 + · · · + x2n = ρ(x̄, 0̄) = x̄ · x̄

(three formulas that are all equal by Definitions 2 and 3).

5. The inverse of x̄,
−x̄ = (−x1 , −x2 , . . . , −xn ).
6. The product of x̄ by a scalar c ∈ E 1 ,
cx̄ = x̄c = (cx1 , cx2 , . . . , cxn );
in particular, (−1)x̄ = (−x1 , −x2 , . . . , −xn ) = −x̄, 1x̄ = x̄, and 0x̄ = 0̄.

7. The difference of x̄ and ȳ,
−→

x̄ − ȳ = yx = (x1 − y1 , x2 − y2 , . . . , xn − yn ).
In particular, x̄ − 0̄ = x̄ and 0̄ − x̄ = −x̄. (Verify!)
Note 1. Definitions 2–4 yield scalars, while the rest are vectors.
Note 2. We shall not define inequalities (<) in E n (n ≥ 2), nor shall
we define vector products other than the dot product (2), which is a scalar .
(However, cf. §8.)
1

Sums of three or more vectors are defined by induction, as in Chapter 2, §§5–6.

§§1–3. The Euclidean n-Space, E n

65

Note 3. From Definitions 3, 4, and 7, we obtain ρ(x̄, ȳ) = |x̄ − ȳ|. (Verify!)
Note 4. We often write x̄/c for (1/c)x̄, where c ∈ E 1 , c 6= 0.
Note 5. In E 1 , x̄ = (x1 ) = x1 . Thus, by Definition 4,
q
|x̄| = x21 = |x1 |,

where |x1 | is defined as in Chapter 2, §§1–4, Definition 4. Thus the two definitions agree.
We call x̄ a unit vector iff its length is 1, i.e., |x| = 1. Note that if x̄ 6= 0̄,
then x̄/|x̄| is a unit vector, since
s

= 1.
|x̄|
|x̄|2
|x̄|2
The vectors x̄ and ȳ are said to be orthogonal or perpendicular (x̄ ⊥ ȳ) iff
x̄ · ȳ = 0 and parallel (x̄ k ȳ) iff x̄ = tȳ or ȳ = tx̄ for some t ∈ E 1 . Note that
x̄ ⊥ 0̄ and x̄ k 0̄.
Examples.

If x̄ = (0, −1, 4, 2) and ȳ = (2, 2, −3, 2) are vectors in E 4 , then
x̄ + ȳ = (2, 1, 1, 4);
x̄ − ȳ = (−2, −3, 7, 0);
p
√
ρ(x̄, ȳ) = |x̄ − ȳ| = 22 + 32 + 72 + 02 = 62 ;

(x̄ + ȳ) · (x̄ − ȳ) = 2(−2) + 1(−3) + 7 + 0 = 0.
So (x̄ + ȳ) ⊥ (x̄ − ȳ) here.

Theorem 1. For any vectors x̄, ȳ, and z̄ ∈ E n and any a, b ∈ E 1 , we have
(a) x̄ + ȳ and ax̄ are vectors in E n (closure laws);

(b) x̄ + ȳ = ȳ + x̄ (commutativity of vector addition);
(c) (x̄ + ȳ) + z̄ = x̄ + (ȳ + z̄) (associativity of vector addition);
(d) x̄ + 0̄ = 0̄ + x̄ = x̄, i .e., 0̄ is the neutral element of addition;
(e) x̄ + (−x̄) = 0̄, i .e., −x̄ is the additive inverse of x̄;

(f) a(x̄ + ȳ) = ax̄ + aȳ and (a + b)x̄ = ax̄ + bx̄ (distributive laws);

(g) (ab)x̄ = a(bx̄);
(h) 1x̄ = x̄.
Proof. Assertion (a) is immediate from Definitions 1 and 6. The rest follows
from corresponding properties of real numbers.

66

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

For example, to prove (b), let x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ), ȳ = (y1 , . . . , yn ). Then by
definition, we have
x̄ + ȳ = (x1 + y1 , . . . , xn + yn ) and ȳ + x̄ = (y1 + x1 , . . . , yn + xn ).
The right sides in both expressions, however, coincide since addition is commutative in E 1 . Thus x̄ + ȳ = ȳ + x̄, as claimed; similarly for the rest, which
we leave to the reader. 
Theorem 2. If x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ) is a vector in E n , then, with ēk as above,
x̄ = x1 ē1 + x2 ē2 + · · · + xn ēn =
Moreover, if x̄ =

ak ēk for some ak ∈ E 1 , then necessarily ak = xk ,

Proof. By definition,
ē1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), ē2 = (0, 1, . . . , 0), . . . , ēn = (0, 0, . . . , 1).
Thus
x1 ē1 = (x1 , 0, . . . , 0), x2 ē2 = (0, x2 , . . . , 0), . . . , xn ēn = (0, 0, . . . , xn ).
Adding up componentwise, we obtain
n
X

xk ēk = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = x̄,

k=1

as asserted.
Moreover, if the xk are replaced by any other ak ∈ E 1 , the same process
yields
(a1 , . . . , an ) = x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ),
i.e., the two n-tuples coincide, whence ak = xk , k = 1, . . . , n. 
Note 6. Any sum of the form
m
X

k=1

ak x̄k

(ak ∈ E 1 , x̄k ∈ E n )

is called a linear combination of the vectors x̄k (whose number m is arbitrary).
Thus Theorem 2 shows that any x̄ ∈ E n can be expressed, in a unique way, as
a linear combination of the n basic unit vectors. In E 3 , we write
x̄ = x1 ī + x2 j̄ + x3 k̄.

67

§§1–3. The Euclidean n-Space, E n

Note 7. If, as above, some vectors are numbered (e.g., x̄1 , x̄2 , . . . , x̄m ),
we denote their components by attaching a second subscript; for example, the
components of x̄1 are x11 , x12 , . . . , x1n .
Theorem 3. For any vectors x̄, ȳ, and z̄ ∈ E n and any a, b ∈ E 1 , we have
(a) x̄ · x̄ ≥ 0, and x̄ · x̄ > 0 iff x̄ 6= 0̄;

(b) (ax̄) · (bȳ) = (ab)(x̄ · ȳ);

(c) x̄ · ȳ = ȳ · x̄ (commutativity of inner products);

(d) (x̄ + ȳ) · z̄ = x̄ · z̄ + ȳ · z̄ (distributive law ).

Proof. To prove these properties, express all in terms of the components of x̄,
ȳ, and z̄, and proceed as in Theorem 1. 
Note that (b) implies x̄ · 0̄ = 0 (put a = 1, b = 0).

Theorem 4. For any vectors x̄ and ȳ ∈ E n and any a ∈ E 1 , we have the
following properties:
(a′ ) |x̄| ≥ 0, and |x̄| > 0 iff x̄ 6= 0̄.

(b′ ) |ax̄| = |a||x̄|.

(Cauchy–Schwarz inequality).

Equality, |x̄ · ȳ| = |x̄| |ȳ|, holds iff x̄ k ȳ.

(d′ ) |x̄ + ȳ| ≤ |x̄| + |ȳ| and |x̄| − |ȳ| ≤ |x̄ − ȳ| (triangle inequalities).
Proof. Property (a′ ) follows from Theorem 3(a) since
|x̄|2 = x̄ · x̄ (see Definition 4).
For (b′ ), use Theorem 3(b), to obtain
(ax̄) · (ax̄) = a2 (x̄ · x̄) = a2 |x̄|2 .
By Definition 4, however,
(ax̄) · (ax̄) = |ax̄|2 .
Thus
|ax̄|2 = a2 |x|2
so that |ax̄| = |a||x̄|, as claimed.
Now we prove (c′ ). If x̄ k ȳ then x̄ = tȳ or ȳ = tx̄; so |x̄ · ȳ| = |x̄||ȳ| follows
by (b′ ). (Verify!)

proving (c′ ).
To prove (d′ ), use Definition 2 and Theorem 3(d), to obtain

|x̄ + ȳ|2 = (x̄ + ȳ) · (x̄ + ȳ) = x̄ · x̄ + ȳ · ȳ + 2x̄ · ȳ = |x̄|2 + |ȳ|2 + 2x̄ · ȳ.

But x̄ · ȳ ≤ |x̄| |ȳ| by (c′ ). Thus we have

|x̄ + ȳ|2 ≤ |x̄|2 + |ȳ|2 + 2|x̄| |ȳ| = (|x̄| + |ȳ|)2 ,

whence |x̄ + ȳ| ≤ |x̄| + |ȳ|, as required.
Finally, replacing here x̄ by x̄ − ȳ, we have
|x̄ − ȳ| + |ȳ| ≥ |x̄ − ȳ + ȳ| = |x̄|, or |x̄ − ȳ| ≥ |x̄| − |ȳ|.
Similarly, replacing ȳ by ȳ − x̄, we get |x̄ − ȳ| ≥ |ȳ| − |x̄|. Hence

|x̄ − ȳ| ≥ ± |x̄| − |ȳ| ,

i.e., |x̄ − ȳ| ≥ |x̄| − |ȳ| , proving the second formula in (d′ ).



Theorem 5. For any points x̄, ȳ, and z̄ ∈ E n , we have
(i) ρ(x̄, ȳ) ≥ 0, and ρ(x̄, ȳ) = 0 iff x̄ = ȳ;
(ii) ρ(x̄, ȳ) = ρ(ȳ, x̄);

(iii) ρ(x̄, z̄) ≤ ρ(x̄, ȳ) + ρ(ȳ, z̄) (triangle inequality).
Proof.
(i) By Definition 3 and Note 3, ρ(x̄, ȳ) = |x̄− ȳ|; therefore, by Theorem 4(a′ ),
ρ(x̄, ȳ) = |x̄ − ȳ| ≥ 0.
Also, |x̄ − ȳ| > 0 iff x̄ − ȳ 6= 0, i.e., iff x̄ 6= ȳ. Hence ρ(x̄, ȳ) 6= 0 iff
x̄ 6= ȳ, and assertion (i) follows.

69

§§1–3. The Euclidean n-Space, E n

(ii) By Theorem 4(b′ ), |x̄ − ȳ| = |(−1)(ȳ − x̄)| = |ȳ − x̄|, so (ii) follows.

(iii) By Theorem 4(d′ ),

ρ(x̄, ȳ) + ρ(ȳ, z̄) = |x̄ − ȳ| + |ȳ − z̄| ≥ |x̄ − ȳ + ȳ − z̄| = ρ(x̄, z̄).



Note 8. We also have |ρ(x̄, ȳ) − ρ(z̄, ȳ)| ≤ ρ(x̄, z̄). (Prove it!) The two
triangle inequalities have a simple geometric interpretation (which explains
their name). If x̄, ȳ, and z̄ are treated as the vertices of a triangle, we obtain
that the length of a side, ρ(x̄, z̄) never exceeds the sum of the two other sides
and is never less than their difference.
As E 1 is a special case of E n (in which “vectors” are single numbers), all
our theory applies to E 1 as well. In particular, distances in E 1 are defined by
ρ(x, y) = |x − y| and obey the three laws of Theorem 5. Dot products in E 1
become ordinary products xy. (Why?) From Theorems 4(b′ )(d′ ), we have
|a| |x| = |ax|; |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|; |x − y| ≥ |x| − |y|

(a, x, y ∈ E 1 ).

§§4–6. Lines and Planes in E n
I. To obtain a line in E 2 or E 3 passing through two points ā and b̄, we take
the vector
−→
~u = ab = b̄ − ā
and, so to say, “stretch” it indefinitely in both directions, i.e., multiply ~u by
all possible scalars t ∈ E 1 . Then the set of all points x̄ of the form
x̄ = ā + t~u
is the required line. It is natural to adopt this as a definition in E n as well.
Below, ā 6= b̄.

Definition 1.

The line ab through the points ā, b̄ ∈ E n (also called the line through ā,
in the direction of the vector ~u = b̄ − ā) is the set of all points x̄ ∈ E n of
the form
x̄ = ā + t~u = ā + t(b̄ − ā),
where t varies over E 1 . We call t a variable real parameter and ~u a
direction vector for ab. Thus
Line ab = {x̄ ∈ E n | x̄ = ā + t~u for some t ∈ E 1 },

~u = b̄ − ā 6= 0̄.

(1)

72

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

The formula
x̄ = ā + t~u, or x̄ = ā + t(b̄ − ā),
is called the parametric equation of the line. (We briefly say “the line x̄ =
ā + t~u.”) It is equivalent to n simultaneous equations in terms of coordinates,
namely,
xk = ak + tuk = ak + t(bk − ak ), k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(2)
Note 1. As the vector ~u is anyway being multiplied by all real numbers t,
the line (as a set of points) will not change if ~u is replaced by some c~u (c ∈ E 1 ,
c 6= 0). In particular, taking c = 1/|~u|, we may replace ~u by ~u/|~u|, a unit
vector . We may as well assume that ~u is a unit vector itself.
If we let t vary not over all of E 1 but only over some interval in E 1 , we obtain
what is called a line segment.1 In particular, we define the open line segment
L(ā, b̄), the closed line segment L[ā, b̄], the half-open line segment L(ā, b̄], and
the half-closed line segment L[ā, b̄), as we did for E 1 .
Definition 2.
Given ~u = b̄ − ā, we set
(i) L(ā, b̄) = {ā + t~u | 0 < t < 1};2

(iii) L(ā, b̄] = {ā + t~u | 0 < t ≤ 1};

(ii) L[ā, b̄] = {ā + t~u | 0 ≤ t ≤ 1};

(iv) L[ā, b̄) = {ā + t~u | 0 ≤ t < 1};

In all cases, ā and b̄ are called the endpoints of the segment; ρ(ā, b̄) =
|b̄ − ā| is its length; and 12 (ā + b̄) is its midpoint.
Note that in E 1 , line segments simply become intervals, (a, b), [a, b], etc.
II. To describe a plane in E 3 , we fix one of its points, ā, and a vector
→

~u = ab perpendicular to the plane (imagine a vertical pencil standing at ā on
−→
the horizontal plane of the table). Then a point x̄ lies on the plane iff ~u ⊥ ax.
It is natural to accept this as a definition in E n as well.
Definition 3.
Given a point ā ∈ E n and a vector ~u 6= ~0, we define the plane (also called
hyperplane if n > 3) through ā, orthogonal to ~u, to be the set of all x̄ ∈ E n
−→
such that ~u ⊥ ax, i.e., ~u · (x̄ − ā) = 0, or, in terms of components,
n
X

k=1

1
2

uk (xk − ak ) = 0, where ~u 6= ~0 (i.e., not all values uk are 0).

We reserve the name “interval” for other kinds of sets (cf. §7).
This is an abbreviation for “{x̄ ∈ E n | x̄ = ā + t~
u for some t ∈ E 1 , 0 < t < 1}.”

(3)

73

§§4–6. Lines and Planes in E n

We briefly say
“the plane ~u · (x̄ − ā) = 0” or “the plane

n
X

k=1

uk (xk − ak ) = 0”

(this being the equation of the plane). Removing brackets in (3), we have
u1 x2 + u2 x2 + · · · + un xn = c, or ~u · x̄ = c, where c =

n
X

k−1

uk ak , ~u 6= ~0. (4)

An equation of this form is said to be linear in x1 , x2 , . . . , xn .
Theorem 1. A set A ⊆ E n is a plane (hyperplane) iff A is exactly the set of
all x̄ ∈ E n satisfying (4) for some fixed c ∈ E 1 and ~u = (u1 , . . . , un ) 6= 0̄.

Proof. Indeed, as we saw above, each plane has an equation of the form (4).
Conversely, any equation of that form (with, say, u1 6= 0) can be written as

c 
u1 x 1 −
+ u2 x2 + u3 x3 + · · · + un xn = 0.
u1

Then, setting a1 = c/u1 and ak = 0 for k ≥ 2, we transform it into (3), which is,
by definition, the equation of a plane through ā = (c/u1 , 0, . . . , 0), orthogonal
to ~u = (u1 , . . . , un ). 
Thus, briefly, planes are exactly all sets with linear equations (4). In this
connection, equation (4) is called the general equation of a plane. The vector ~u
is said to be normal to the plane. Clearly, if both sides of (4) are multiplied by
a nonzero scalar q, one obtains an equivalent equation (representing the same
set). Thus we may replace uk by quk , i.e., ~u by q~u, without affecting the plane.
In particular, we may replace ~u by the unit vector ~u/|~u|, as in lines (this is
called the normalization of the equation). Thus
~u
· (x̄ − ā) = 0
|~u|
and
x̄ = ā + t

~u
|~u|

(5)

(6)

are the normalized (or normal ) equations of the plane (3) and line (1), respectively.
Note 2. The equation xk = c (for a fixed k) represents a plane orthogonal
to the basic unit vector ~ek or, as we shall say, to the kth axis. The equation
results from (4) if we take ~u = ~ek so that uk = 1, while ui = 0 (i 6= k). For
example, x1 = c is the equation of a plane orthogonal to ~e1 ; it consists of all
x̄ ∈ E n , with x1 = c (while the other coordinates of x̄ are arbitrary). In E 2 , it
is a line. In E 1 , it consists of c alone.

74

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Two planes (respectively, two lines) are said to be perpendicular to each
other iff their normal vectors (respectively, direction vectors) are orthogonal;
similarly for parallelism. A plane ~u · x̄ = c is said to be perpendicular to a line
x̄ = ā + t~v iff ~u k ~v ; the line and the plane are parallel iff ~u ⊥ ~v .
Note 3. When normalizing, as in (5) or (6), we actually have two choices
of a unit vector, namely, ±~u/|~u|. If one of them is prescribed , we speak of a
directed plane (respectively, line).
Examples.
(a) Let ā = (0, −1, 2), b̄ = (1, 1, 1), and c̄ = (3, 1, −1) in E 3 . Then the line
ab has the parametric equation x̄ = ā + t(b̄ − ā) or, in coordinates, writing
x, y, z for x1 , x2 , x3 ,
x = 0 + t(1 − 0) = t, y = −1 + 2t, z = 2 − t.
This may be rewritten
t=

where ~u = (1, 2, −1) is the direction vector (composed of the denominators). Normalizing and dropping t, we have

where “t = (y − 1)/0” stands for “y − 1 = 0.” (It is customary to use this
notation.)
(b) Let ā = (1, −2, 0, 3) and ~u = (1, 1, 1, 1) in E 4 . Then the plane normal
to ~u through ā has the equation (x̄ − ā) · ~u = 0, or
(x1 − 1) · 1 + (x2 + 2) · 1 + (x3 − 0) · 1 + (x4 − 3) · 1 = 0,
or x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 2. Observe that, by formula (4), the coefficients of x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 are the components of the normal vector ~u (here
(1, 1, 1, 1)).
Now define a map f : E 4 → E 1 setting f (x̄) = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 (the
left-hand side of the equation). This map is called the linear functional
corresponding to the given plane. (For another approach, see Problems 4–
6 below.)

75

§§4–6. Lines and Planes in E n

(c) The equation x+3y−2z = 1 represents a plane in E 3 , with ~u = (1, 3, −2).
The point ā = (1, 0, 0) lies on the plane (why?), so the plane equation
may be written (x̄ − ā) · ~u = 0 or x̄ · ~u = 1, where x̄ = (x, y, z) and ā and
~u are as above.

Problems on Lines and Planes in E n
1. Let ā = (−1, 2, 0, −7), b̄ = (0, 0, −1, 2), and c̄ = (2, 4, −3, −3) be
points in E 4 . Find the symmetric normal equations (see Example (a)) of
the lines ab, bc, and ca. Are any two of the lines perpendicular? Parallel?
On the line ab, find some points inside L(ā, b̄) and some outside L[ā, b̄].
Also, find the symmetric equations of the line through c̄ that is
(i) parallel to ab;

(ii) perpendicular to ab.

2. With ā and b̄ as in Problem 1, find the equations of the two planes that
trisect, and are perpendicular to, the line segment L[ā, b̄].

f (t) = ā + t~u for t ∈ E 1 .

Show that L[ā, b̄] is exactly the f -image of the interval [0, 1] in E 1 , with
f (0) = a and f (1) = b, while f [E 1 ] is the entire line. Also show that f
is one to one.

Thus it is the Cartesian product of
two line intervals, (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ). To include also all or some sides,
we would have to replace open intervals by closed, half-closed, or half-open
ones. Similarly, Cartesian products of three line intervals yield rectangular
parallelepipeds in E 3 . We call such sets in E n intervals.
Definitions.
1. By an interval in E n we mean the Cartesian product of any n intervals
in E 1 (some may be open, some closed or half-open, etc.).

77

§7. Intervals in E n

2. In particular, given
ā = (a1 , . . . , an ) and b̄ = (b1 , . . . , bn )
with
ak ≤ bk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n,
we define the open interval (ā, b̄), the closed interval [ā, b̄], the half-open
interval (ā, b̄], and the half-closed interval [ā, b̄) as follows:
(ā, b̄) = {x̄ | ak < xk < bk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n}
= (a1 , b1 ) × (a2 , b2 ) × · · · × (an , bn );

[ā, b̄] = {x̄ | ak ≤ xk ≤ bk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n}
= [a1 , b1 ] × [a2 , b2 ] × · · · × [an , bn ];

(ā, b̄] = {x̄ | ak < xk ≤ bk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n}
= (a1 , b1 ] × (a2 , b2 ] × · · · × (an , bn ];

[a, b) = {x̄ | ak ≤ xk < bk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n}
= [a1 , b1 ) × [a2 , b2 ) × · · · × [an , bn ).

In all cases, ā and b̄ are called the endpoints of the interval. Their distance
ρ(ā, b̄) = |b̄ − ā|
is called its diagonal . The n differences
bk − ak = ℓk

(k = 1, . . . , n)

are called its n edge-lengths. Their product
n
Y

k=1

ℓk =

(bk − ak )

is called the volume of the interval (in E 2 it is its area, in E 1 its length). The
point
1
c̄ = (ā + b̄)
2
is called its center or midpoint. The set difference
[ā, b̄] − (ā, b̄)
is called the boundary of any interval with endpoints ā and b̄; it consists of 2n
“faces” defined in a natural manner. (How?)
We often denote intervals by single letters, e.g., A = (ā, b̄), and write dA for
“diagonal of A” and vA or vol A for “volume of A.” If all edge-lengths bk − ak

78

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

are equal , A is called a cube (in E 2 , a square). The interval A is said to be
degenerate iff bk = ak for some k, in which case, clearly,
vol A =

n
Y

(bk − ak ) = 0.

k=1

Note 1. We have x̄ ∈ (ā, b̄) iff the inequalities ak < xk < bk hold simultaneously for all k. This is impossible if ak = bk for some k; similarly for the
inequalities ak < xk ≤ bk or ak ≤ xk < bk . Thus a degenerate interval is
empty, unless it is closed (in which case it contains ā and b̄ at least).
Note 2. In any interval A,
dA = ρ(ā, b̄) =

In E 2 , we can split an interval A into two subintervals P and Q by drawing
a line (see Figure 2). In E 3 , this is done by a plane orthogonal to one of the
axes of the form xk = c (see §§4–6, Note 2), with ak < c < bk . In particular, if
c = 21 (ak + bk ), the plane bisects the kth edge of A; and so the kth edge-length
of P (and Q) equals 12 ℓk = 21 (bk − ak ). If A is closed, so is P or Q, depending
on our choice. (We may include the “partition” xk = c in P or Q.)1
Now, successively draw n planes
Y
xk = ck , ck = 12 (ak + bk ), k =
b̄
1, 2, . . . , n. The first plane bisects
ℓj leaving the other edges of A unchanged. The resulting two subintervals P and Q then are cut by the
plane x2 = c2 , bisecting the secā
ond edge in each of them. Thus we
get four subintervals (see Figure 3 for
0̄
X
E 2 ). Each successive plane doubles
Figure 3
the number of subintervals. After n
steps, we thus obtain 2n disjoint intervals, with all edges ℓk bisected. Thus by

Note 3. If A is closed then, as noted above, we can make any one (but only
one) of the 2n subintervals closed by properly manipulating each step.
The proof of the following simple corollaries is left to the reader.
1

We have either P = {x̄ ∈ A | xk ≤ c} and Q = {x̄ ∈ A | xk > c}, or P = {x̄ ∈ A | xk < c}
and Q = {x̄ ∈ A | xk ≥ c}.

§7. Intervals in E n

Corollary 1. No distance between two points of an interval A exceeds dA, its
diagonal . That is, (∀ x̄, ȳ ∈ A) ρ(x̄, ȳ) ≤ dA.
Corollary 2. If an interval A contains p̄ and q̄, then also L[p̄, q̄] ⊆ A.

Corollary 3. Every nondegenerate interval in E n contains rational points,
i .e., points whose coordinates are all rational .
(Hint: Use the density of rationals in E 1 for each coordinate separately.)

5. Show that the sets P and Q as defined in footnote 1 are intervals, indeed.
In particular, they can be made half-open (half-closed) if A is half-open

P = {x̄ ∈ A | xk ≤ c}, and Q = {x̄ ∈ A | xk > c}.
To fix ideas, let k = 1, i.e., cut the first edge. Then let
p̄ = (c, a2 , . . . , an ) and q̄ = (c, b2 , . . . , bn ) (see Figure 2),

§8. Complex Numbers
With all the operations defined in §§1–3, E n (n > 1) is not yet a field because
of the lack of a vector multiplication satisfying the field axioms. We shall now
define such a multiplication, but only for E 2 . Thus E 2 will become a field,
which we shall call the complex field , C.

81

§8. Complex Numbers

We make some changes in notaz
Y
tion and terminology here. Points of
2
E , when regarded as elements of C,
will be called complex numbers (each
being an ordered pair of real num0
X
bers). We denote them by single letters (preferably z) without a bar or
z
an arrow. For example, z = (x, y).
Figure 5
We preferably write (x, y) for (x1 , x2 ). If z = (x, y), then x and y are called
the real and imaginary parts of z, respectively,1 and z̄ denotes the complex
number (x, −y), called the conjugate of z (see Figure 5).
Complex numbers with vanishing imaginary part, (x, 0), are called real
points of C. For brevity, we simply write x for (x, 0); for example, 2 = (2, 0).
In particular, 1 = (1, 0) = θ̄1 is called the real unit in C. Points with vanishing real part, (0, y), are called (purely) imaginary numbers. In particular,
θ̄2 = (0, 1) is such a number; we shall now denote it by i and call it the imaginary unit in C. Apart from these peculiarities, all our former definitions of
§§1–3 remain valid in E 2 = C. In particular, if z = (x, y) and z ′ = (x′ , y ′ ), we
have
z ± z ′ = (x, y) ± (x′ , y ′ ) = (x ± x′ , y ± y ′ ),
p
ρ(z, z ′ ) = (x − x′ )2 + (y − y ′ )2 , and
p
|z| = x2 + y 2 .
All theorems of §§1–3 are valid.
We now define the new multiplication in C, which will make it a field.
Definition 1.
If z = (x, y) and z ′ = (x′ , y ′ ), then zz ′ = (xx′ − yy ′ , xy ′ + yx′ ).
Theorem 1. E 2 = C is a field , with zero element 0 = (0, 0) and unity 1 =
(1, 0), under addition and multiplication as defined above.
Proof. We only must show that multiplication obeys Axioms I–VI of the field
axioms. Note that for addition, all is proved in Theorem 1 of §§1–3.
Axiom I (closure) is obvious from our definition, for if z and z ′ are in C, so
is zz ′ .
To prove commutativity, take any complex numbers
z = (x, y) and z ′ = (x′ , y ′ )
1

This terminology is solely traditional. Actually, there is nothing “imaginary” about

and verify that zz ′ = z ′ z. Indeed, by definition,
zz ′ = (xx′ − yy ′ , xy ′ + yx′ ) and z ′ z = (x′ x − y ′ y, x′ y + y ′ x);
but the two expressions coincide by the commutative laws for real numbers.
Associativity and distributivity are proved in a similar manner.
Next, we show that 1 = (1, 0) satisfies Axiom IV(b), i.e., that 1z = z for
any complex number z = (x, y). In fact, by definition, and by axioms for E 1 ,
1z = (1, 0) (x, y) = (1x − 0y, 1y + 0x) = (x − 0, y + 0) = (x, y) = z.
It remains to verify Axiom V(b), i.e., to show that each complex number
z = (x, y) 6= (0, 0) has an inverse z −1 such that zz −1 = 1. It turns out that
the inverse is obtained by setting

since x2 + y 2 = |z|2 , by definition. This completes the proof. 
Corollary 1. i2 = −1; i .e., (0, 1)(0, 1) = (−1, 0).

Proof. By definition, (0, 1)(0, 1) = (0 · 0 − 1 · 1, 0 · 1 + 1 · 0) = (−1, 0).



Thus C has an element i whose square is −1, while E 1 has no such element,
by Corollary 2 in Chapter 2, §§1–4. This is no contradiction since that corollary
holds in ordered fields only. It only shows that C cannot be made an ordered
field.
However, the “real points” in C form a subfield that can be ordered by
setting
(x, 0) < (x′ , 0) iff x < x′ in E 1 .2
Then this subfield behaves exactly like E 1 .3 Therefore, it is customary not to
distinguish between “real points in C” and “real numbers,” identifying (x, 0)
with x. With this convention, E 1 simply is a subset (and a subfield ) of C.
Henceforth, we shall simply say that “x is real” or “x ∈ E 1 ” instead of “x =
(x, 0) is a real point.” We then obtain the following result.
Theorem 2. Every z ∈ C has a unique representation as
z = x + yi,

The proof is left as an exercise (Problem 1′ below).
This can be made precise by using the notion of isomorphism (see Basic Concepts of Mathematics,
Chapter 2, §14). We shall not go deeper into this topic here.

where x and y are real and i = (0, 1). Specifically,
z = x + yi iff z = (x, y).
Proof. By our conventions, x = (x, 0) and y = (y, 0), so
x + yi = (x, 0) + (y, 0)(0, 1).
Computing the right-hand expression from definitions, we have for any x, y ∈
E 1 that
x + yi = (x, 0) + (y · 0 − 0 · 1, y · 1 + 0 · 1) = (x, 0) + (0, y) = (x, y).
Thus (x, y) = x + yi for any x, y ∈ E 1 . In particular, if (x, y) is the given
number z ∈ C of the theorem, we obtain z = (x, y) = x + yi, as required.
To prove uniqueness, suppose that we also have
z = x′ + y ′ i with x′ = (x′ , 0) and y ′ = (y ′ , 0).
Then, as shown above, z = (x′ , y ′ ). Since also z = (x, y), we have (x, y) =
(x′ , y ′ ), i.e., the two ordered pairs coincide, and so x = x′ and y = y ′ after
all. 
Geometrically, instead of Cartesian coordinates (x, y), we may also
use polar coordinates r, θ, where
p
r = x2 + y 2 = |z|

but θ is not uniquely determined by

(If z = 0, then θ is not defined at all.) The values r and θ are called, respectively, the modulus and argument of z = (x, y). By elementary trigonometry,
x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. Substituting in z = x + yi, we obtain the following
corollary.
Corollary 2. z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) (trigonometric or polar form of z).

§9. Vector Spaces. The Space C n . Euclidean Spaces

I. We shall now follow the pattern of E n to obtain the general notion of a
vector space (just as we generalized E 1 to define fields).
Let V be a set of arbitrary elements (not necessarily n-tuples), called “vectors” or “points,” with a certain operation (call it “addition,” +) somehow
defined in V . Let F be any field (e.g., E 1 or C); its elements will be called
scalars; its zero and unity will be denoted by 0 and 1, respectively. Suppose
that yet another operation (“multiplication of scalars by vectors”) has been
defined that assigns to every scalar c ∈ F and every vector x ∈ V a certain
vector, denoted cx or xc and called the c-multiple of x. Furthermore, suppose that this multiplication and addition in V satisfy the nine laws specified
in Theorem 1 of §§1–3. That is, we have closure:
(∀ x, y ∈ V ) (∀ c ∈ F )

x + y ∈ V and cx ∈ V .

86

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Vector addition is commutative and associative. There is a unique zero-vector ,
~0, such that
(∀ x ∈ V ) x + ~0 = x,
and each x ∈ V has a unique inverse, −x, such that
x + (−x) = ~0.

We have distributivity:
a(x + y) = ax + ay and (a + b)x = ax + bx.
Finally, we have
1x = x
and
(ab)x = a(bx)
(a, b ∈ F ; x, y ∈ V ).
In this case, V together with these two operations is called a vector space
(or a linear space) over the field F ; F is called its scalar field , and elements of
F are called the scalars of V .
Examples.
(a) E n is a vector space over E 1 (its scalar field).
(a′ ) Rn , the set of all rational points of E n (i.e., points with rational coordinates) is a vector space over R, the rationals in E 1 . (Note that we could
take R as a scalar field for all of E n ; this would yield another vector
space, E n over R, not to be confused with E n over E 1 , i.e., the ordinary
E n .)
(b) Let F be any field, and let F n be the set of all ordered n-tuples of elements
of F , with sums and scalar multiples defined as in E n (with F playing
the role of E 1 ). Then F n is a vector space over F (proof as in Theorem 1
of §§1–3).
(c) Each field F is a vector space (over itself) under the addition and multiplication defined in F . Verify!

(d) Let V be a vector space over a field F , and let W be the set of all possible
mappings
f: A→V
from some arbitrary set A 6= ∅ into V . Define the sum f + g of two such
maps by setting
(f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x) for all x ∈ A.1
1

Here “f + g” must be treated as one letter (function symbol); “(f + g)(x)” means “h(x),”
where h = f + g; similarly for such symbols as af , etc.

∗ §9.

Vector Spaces. The Space C n . Euclidean Spaces

87

Similarly, given a ∈ F and f ∈ W , define the map af by
(af )(x) = af (x).
Under these operations, W is a vector space over the same field F , with
each map f : A → V treated as a single “vector” in W . (Verify!)
Vector spaces over E 1 (respectively, C) are called real (respectively, complex )
linear spaces. Complex spaces can always be transformed into real ones by
restricting their scalar field C to E 1 (treated as a subfield of C).
II. An important example of a complex linear space is C n , the set of all
ordered n-tuples
x = (x1 , . . . , xn )
of complex numbers xk (now treated as scalars), with sums and scalar multiples
defined as in E n . In order to avoid confusion with conjugates of complex
numbers, we shall not use the bar notation x̄ for a vector in this section,
writing simply x for it. Dot products in C n are defined by
x·y =

n
X

xk ȳk ,

k=1

where ȳk is the conjugate of the complex number yk (see §8), and hence a scalar
in C. Note that ȳk = yk if yk ∈ E 1 . Thus, for vectors with real components,
x·y =

n
X

xk y k ,

k=1

as in E n . The reader will easily verify (exactly as for E n ) that, for x, y ∈ C n
and a, b ∈ C, we have the following properties:
(i) x · y ∈ C; thus x · y is a scalar , not a vector.

(ii) x · x ∈ E 1 , and x · x ≥ 0; moreover, x · x = 0 iff x = ~0. (Thus the dot
product of a vector by itself is a real number ≥ 0.)

(iii) x · y = y · x (= conjugate of y · x). Commutativity fails in general.
(iv) (ax) · (by) = (ab̄)(x · y). Hence (iv′ ) (ax) · y = a(x · y) = x · (āy).
(v) (x + y) · z = x · z + y · z and (v′ ) z · (x + y) = z · x + z · y.
Observe that (v′ ) follows from (v) by (iii). (Verify!)

III. Sometimes (but not always) dot products can also be defined in real or
complex linear spaces other than E n or C n , in such a manner as to satisfy the
laws (i)–(v), hence also (v′ ), listed above, with C replaced by E 1 if the space
is real. If these laws hold, the space is called Euclidean. For example, E n is a
real Euclidean space and C n is a complex one.

88

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

In every such space, we define absolute values of vectors by
√
|x| = x · x.
(This root exists in E 1 by formula (ii).) In particular, this applies to E n
and C n . Then given any vectors x, y and a scalar a, we obtain as before the
following properties:
(a′ ) |x| ≥ 0; and |x| = 0 iff x = ~0.
(b′ ) |ax| = |a| |x|.

(c′ ) Triangle inequality: |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|.

(d′ ) Cauchy–Schwarz inequality: |x · y| ≤ |x| |y|, and |x · y| = |x| |y| iff x k y
(i.e., x = ay or y = ax for some scalar a).
We prove only (d′ ); the rest is proved as in Theorem 4 of §§1–3.
If x · y = 0, all is trivial, so let z = x · y = rc 6= 0, where r = |x · y| and c has
modulus 1, and let y ′ = cy. For any (variable) t ∈ E 1 , consider |tx + y ′ |. By
definition and (v), (iii), and (iv),
|tx + y ′ |2 = (tx + y ′ ) · (tx + y ′ )

= tx · tx + y ′ · tx + tx · y ′ + y ′ · y ′

= t2 (x · x) + t(y ′ · x) + t(x · y ′ ) + (y ′ · y ′ )

since t̄ = t. Now, since cc̄ = 1,
x · y ′ = x · (cy) = (c̄x) · y = c̄rc = r = |x · y|.
Similarly,
y ′ · x = x · y ′ = r̄ = r = |x · y|, x · x = |x|2 , and y ′ · y ′ = y · y = |y|2 .
Thus we obtain
(∀ t ∈ E 1 )

|tx + cy|2 = t2 |x|2 + 2t|x · y| + |y|2 .

(1)

Here |x|2 , 2|x · y|, and |y|2 are fixed real numbers. We treat them as coefficients in t of the quadratic trinomial
f (t) = t2 |x|2 + 2t|x · y| + |y|2 .
Now if x and y are not parallel, then cy 6= −tx, and so
|tx + cy| = |tx + y ′ | 6= 0

for any t ∈ E 1 . Thus by (1), the quadratic trinomial has no real roots; hence
its discriminant,
4|x · y|2 − 4(|x| |y|)2 ,
is negative, so that |x · y| < |x| |y|.

∗ §9.

Vector Spaces. The Space C n . Euclidean Spaces

If, however, x k y, one easily obtains |x · y| = |x| |y|, by (b′ ). (Verify.)
Thus |x · y| = |x| |y| or |x · y| < |x| |y| according to whether x k y or not. 
In any Euclidean space, we define distances by ρ(x, y) = |x − y|. Planes,
lines, and line segments are defined exactly as in E n . Thus
line pq = {p + t(q − p) | t ∈ E 1 } (in real and complex spaces alike).

§10. Normed Linear Spaces

By a normed linear space (briefly normed space) is meant a real or complex
vector space E in which every vector x is associated with a real number |x|,
called its absolute value or norm, in such a manner that the properties (a′ )–(c′ )
of §9 hold.1 That is, for any vectors x, y ∈ E and scalar a, we have
(i) |x| ≥ 0;

(i′ ) |x| = 0 iff x = ~0;

(ii) |ax| = |a| |x|; and

(iii) |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| (triangle inequality).

Mathematically, the existence of absolute values in E amounts to that of a
map (called a norm map) x → |x| on E, i.e., a map ϕ : E → E 1 , with function
values ϕ(x) written as |x|, satisfying the laws (i)–(iii) above. Often such a map
can be chosen in many ways (not necessarily via dot products, which may not
exist in E), thus giving rise to different norms on E. Sometimes we write kxk
for |x| or use other similar symbols.
Note 1. From (iii), we also obtain |x − y| ≥ |x| − |y| exactly as in E n .

If A = ∅, then span(A) = {~0} by definition.
Roughly, it is a vector space (over E 1 or C) in which “well-behaved” absolute values are
defined, resembling those in E n .

Normed Linear Spaces

Examples.
(A) Each Euclidean space (§9), such as E n or C n , is a normed space, with
norm defined by
√
|x| = x · x ,
as follows from formulas (a′ )–(c′ ) in §9. In E n and C n , one can also
equivalently define
s n
X
|x| =
|xk |2 ,
k=1

where x = (x1 , . . . , xn ). This is the so-called standard norm, usually
presupposed in E n (C n ).
(B) One can also define other, “nonstandard ,” norms on E n and C n . For
example, fix some real p ≥ 1 and put
|x|p =

X
n

k=1

p

|xk |

1

p

.

One can show that |x|p so defined satisfies (i)–(iii) and thus is a norm
(see Problems 5–7 below).
(C) Let W be the set of all bounded maps
f: A→E
from a set A 6= ∅ into a normed space E, i.e., such that
(∀ t ∈ A)

|f (t)| ≤ c

for some real constant c > 0 (dependent on f but not on t). Define f + g
and af as in Example (d) of §9 so that W becomes a vector space. Also,
put
kf k = sup |f (t)|,
t∈A

i.e., the supremum of all |f (t)|, with t ∈ A. Due to boundedness, this
supremum exists in E 1 , so kf k ∈ E 1 .
It is easy to show that kf k is a norm on W . For example, we verify
(iii) as follows.
By definition, we have for f, g ∈ W and x ∈ A,
|(f + g)(x)| = |f (x) + g(x)|

≤ |f (x)| + |g(x)|

≤ sup |f (t)| + sup |g(t)|
t∈A

= kf k + kgk.

t∈A

(1)

92

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

(The first inequality is true because (iii) holds in the normed space E to
which f (x) and g(x) belong.) By (1), kf k + kgk is an upper bound of all
expressions |(f + g)(x)|, x ∈ A. Thus
kf k + kgk ≥ sup |(f + g)(x)| = kf + gk.
x∈A

Note 2. Formula (1) also shows that the map f + g is bounded and hence
is a member of W . Quite similarly we see that af ∈ W for any scalar a and
f ∈ W . Thus we have the closure laws for W . The rest is easy.
In every normed (in particular, in each Euclidean) space E, we define distances by
ρ(x, y) = |x − y| for all x, y ∈ E.
Such distances depend, of course, on the norm chosen for E; thus we call them
norm-induced distances. In particular, using the standard norm in E n and C n
(Example (A)), we have
s n
X
ρ(x, y) =
|xk − yk |2 .
k=1

Using the norm of Example (B), we get
ρ(x, y) =

X
n

k=1

p

|xk − yk |

1

p

instead. In the space W of Example (C), we have
ρ(f, g) = kf − gk = sup |f (x) − g(x)|.
x∈A

Proceeding exactly as in the proof of Theorem 5 in §§1–3, we see that norminduced distances obey the three laws stated there. (Verify!) Moreover, by
definition,
ρ(x + u, y + u) = |(x + u) − (y + u)| = |x − y| = ρ(x, y).
Thus we have
ρ(x, y) = ρ(x + u, y + u) for norm-induced distances;

(2)

i.e., the distance ρ(x, y) does not change if both x and y are “translated ” by
one and the same vector u. We call such distances translation-invariant.
A more general theory of distances will be given in §§11ff.

§11. Metric Spaces

§11. Metric Spaces
I. In §§1–3, we defined distances ρ(x̄, ȳ) for points x̄, ȳ in E n using the
formula
s n
X
(xk − yk )2 = |x̄ − ȳ|.
ρ(x̄, ȳ) =
k=1

This actually amounts to defining a certain function ρ of two variables x̄, ȳ ∈
E n . We also showed that ρ obeys the three laws of Theorem 5 there. (We call
them metric laws.)
Now, as will be seen, such functions ρ can also be defined in other sets,
using quite different defining formulas. In other words, given any set S 6= ∅
of arbitrary elements, one can define in it, so to say, “fancy distances” ρ(x, y)
satisfying the same three laws. It turns out that it is not the particular formula
used to define ρ but rather the preservation of the three laws that is most
important for general theoretical purposes.
Thus we shall assume that a function ρ with the same three properties has
been defined, in some way or other , for a set S 6= ∅, and propose to study the
consequences of the three metric laws alone, without assuming anything else.
(In particular, no operations other than ρ, or absolute values, or inequalities <,
need be defined in S.) All results so obtained will, of course, apply to distances
in E n (since they obey the metric laws), but they will also apply to other cases
where the metric laws hold .
The elements of S (though arbitrary) will be called “points,” usually denoted
by p, q, x, y, z (sometimes with bars, etc.); ρ is called a metric for S. We
symbolize it by
ρ : S × S → E1
since it is function defined on S × S (pairs of elements of S) into E 1 . Thus we
are led to the following definition.
Definition 1.
A metric space is a set S 6= ∅ together with a function
ρ : S × S → E1
(called a metric for S) satisfying the metric laws (axioms):
For any x, y, and z in S, we have
(i) ρ(x, y) ≥ 0, and (i′ ) ρ(x, y) = 0 iff x = y;
(ii) ρ(x, y) = ρ(y, x) (symmetry law); and
(iii) ρ(x, z) ≤ ρ(x, y) + ρ(y, z) (triangle law).

96

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Thus a metric space is a pair (S, ρ), namely, a set S and a metric ρ for it.
In general, one can define many different metrics
ρ, ρ′ , ρ′′ , . . .
for the same S. The resulting spaces
(S, ρ), (S, ρ′ ), (S, ρ′′ ), . . .
then are regarded as different. However, if confusion is unlikely, we simply
write S for (S, ρ). We write “p ∈ (S, ρ)” for “p ∈ S with metric ρ,” and
“A ⊆ (S, ρ)” for “A ⊆ S in (S, ρ).”
Examples.
(1) In E n , we always assume
ρ(x̄, ȳ) = |x̄ − ȳ|

(the “standard metric”)

unless stated otherwise.1 By Theorem 5 in §§1–3, (E n , ρ) is a metric
space.
(2) However, one can define for E n many other “nonstandard” metrics. For
example,
′

ρ (x̄, ȳ) =

X
n

k=1

p

|xk − yk |

1/p

for any real p ≥ 1

likewise satisfies the metric laws (a proof is suggested in §10, Problems 5–
7); similarly for C n .
(3) Any set S 6= ∅ can be “metrized” (i.e., endowed with a metric) by setting
ρ(x, y) = 1 if x 6= y, and ρ(x, x) = 0.
(Verify the metric laws!) This is the so-called discrete metric. The space
(S, ρ) so defined is called a discrete space.
(4) Distances (“mileages”) on the surface of our planet are actually measured
along circles fitting in the curvature of the globe (not straight lines). One
can show that they obey the metric laws and thus define a (nonstandard)
metric for S = (surface of the globe).
(5) A mapping f : A → E 1 is said to be bounded iff
(∃ K ∈ E 1 ) (∀ x ∈ A)
1

|f (x)| ≤ K.

Similarly in other normed spaces (§10), such as C n . (A reader who has omitted the
“starred” §10 will consider E n only.)

97

§11. Metric Spaces

For a fixed A 6= ∅, let W be the set of all such maps (each being treated
as a single “point” of W ). Metrize W by setting, for f, g ∈ W ,
ρ(f, g) = sup |f (x) − g(x)|.
x∈A

(Verify the metric laws; see a similar proof in §10.)
II. We now define “balls” in any metric space (S, ρ).
Definition 2.
Given p ∈ (S, ρ) and a real ε > 0, we define the open ball or globe with
center p and radius ε (briefly “ε-globe about p”), denoted
Gp or Gp (ε) or G(p; ε),
to be the set of all x ∈ S such that
ρ(x, p) < ε.
Similarly, the closed ε-globe about p is
Gp = Gp (ε) = {x ∈ S | ρ(x, p) ≤ ε}.
The ε-sphere about p is defined by
Sp (ε) = {x ∈ S | ρ(x, p) = ε}.
Note. An open globe in E 3 is an ordinary solid sphere (without its surface
Sp (ε)), as known from geometry. In E 2 , an open globe is a disc (the interior
of a circle). In E 1 , the globe Gp (ε) is simply the open interval
(p − ε, p + ε),
while Gp (ε) is the closed interval
[p − ε, p + ε].
The shape of the globes and spheres depends on the metric ρ. It may become
rather strange for various unusual metrics. For example, in the discrete space
(Example (3)), any globe of radius < 1 consists of its center alone, while Gp (2)
contains the entire space. (Why?) See also Problems 1, 2, and 4.
III. Now take any nonempty set
A ⊆ (S, ρ).
The distances ρ(x, y) in S are, of course, also defined for points of A (since
A ⊆ S), and the metric laws remain valid in A. Thus A is likewise a (smaller )
metric space under the metric ρ “inherited ” from S; we only have to restrict
the domain of ρ to A × A (pairs of points from A). The set A with this metric

98

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

is called a subspace of S. We shall denote it by (A, ρ), using the same letter ρ,
or simply by A. Note that A with some other metric ρ′ is not called a subspace
of (S, ρ).
By definition, points in (A, ρ) have the same distances as in (S, ρ). However,
globes and spheres in (A, ρ) must consist of points from A only, with centers
in A. Denoting such a globe by
G∗p (ε) = {x ∈ A | ρ(x, p) < ε},
we see that it is obtained by restricting Gp (ε) (the corresponding globe in S)
to points of A, i.e., removing all points not in A. Thus
G∗p (ε) = A ∩ Gp (ε);
similarly for closed globes and spheres. A ∩ Gp (ε) is often called the relativized
(to A) globe Gp (ε). Note that p ∈ G∗p (ε) since ρ(p, p) = 0 < ε, and p ∈ A.
For example, let R be the subspace of E 1 consisting of rationals only. Then
the relativized globe G∗p (ε) consists of all rationals in the interval
Gp (ε) = (p − ε, p + ε),
and it is assumed here that p is rational itself.
IV. A few remarks are due on the extended real number system E ∗ (see
Chapter 2, §13). As we know, E ∗ consists of all reals and two additional
elements, ±∞, with the convention that −∞ < x < +∞ for all x ∈ E 1 .
The standard metric ρ does not apply to E ∗ . However, one can metrize E ∗ in
various other ways. The most common metric ρ′ is suggested in Problems 5 and
6 below. Under that metric, globes turn out to be finite and infinite intervals
in E ∗ .
Instead of metrizing E ∗ , we may simply adopt the convention that intervals
of the form
(a, +∞] and [−∞, a), a ∈ E 1 ,
will be called “globes” about +∞ and −∞, respectively (without specifying
any “radii”). Globes about finite points may remain as they are in E 1 . This
convention suffices for most purposes of limit theory. We shall use it often (as
we did in Chapter 2, §13).

Problems on Metric Spaces
The “arrowed” problems should be noted for later work.
1. Show that E 2 becomes a metric space if distances ρ(x̄, ȳ) are defined
by
(a) ρ(x̄, ȳ) = |x1 − y1 | + |x2 − y2 | or

(b) ρ(x̄, ȳ) = max{|x1 − y1 |, |x2 − y2 |},

where x̄ = (x1 , x2 ) and ȳ = (y1 , y2 ). In each case, describe G0̄ (1)
and S0̄ (1). Do the same for the subspace of points with nonnegative
coordinates.
2. Prove the assertions made in the text about globes in a discrete space.
Find an empty sphere in such a space. Can a sphere contain the entire
space?
3. Show that ρ in Examples (3) and (5) obeys the metric axioms.
4. Let M be the set of all positive integers together with the “point” ∞.

⇒5. Metrize the extended real number system E ∗ by
ρ′ (x, y) = |f (x) − f (y)|,
where the function
f : E ∗ −→ [−1, 1]
onto

is defined by
f (x) =

x
if x is finite, f (−∞) = −1, and f (+∞) = 1.
1 + |x|

Compute ρ′ (0, +∞), ρ′ (0, −∞), ρ′ (−∞, +∞), ρ′ (0, 1), ρ′ (1, 2), and
ρ′ (n, +∞). Describe G0 (1), G+∞ (1), and G−∞ ( 12 ). Verify the metric
axioms (also when infinities are involved).
⇒6. In Problem 5, show that the function f is one to one, onto [−1, 1], and
increasing; i.e.,
x < x′ implies f (x) < f (x′ ) for x, x′ ∈ E ∗ .
Also show that the f -image of an interval (a, b) ⊆ E ∗ is the interval
(f (a), f (b)). Hence deduce that globes in E ∗ (with ρ′ as in Problem 5)
are intervals in E ∗ (possibly infinite).
[Hint: For a finite x, put
y = f (x) =

Solving for x (separately in the cases x ≥ 0 and x < 0), show that
(∀ y ∈ (−1, 1))

x = f −1 (y) =

thus x is uniquely determined by y, i.e., f is one to one and onto—each y ∈ (−1, 1)
corresponds to some x ∈ E 1 . (How about ±1?)

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces
To show that f is increasing, consider separately the three cases x < 0 < x′ ,
x < x′ < 0 and 0 < x < x′ (also for infinite x and x′ ).]

7. Continuing Problems 5 and 6, consider (E 1 , ρ′ ) as a subspace of (E ∗ , ρ′ )
with ρ′ as in Problem 5. Show that globes in (E 1 , ρ′ ) are exactly all
open intervals in E ∗ . For example, (0, 1) is a globe. What are its center
and radius under ρ′ and under the standard metric ρ?
8. Metrize the closed interval [0, +∞] in E ∗ by setting
ρ(x, y) =

1+x 1+y

with the conventions 1 + (+∞) = +∞ and 1/(+∞) = 0. Verify the
metric axioms. Describe Gp (1) for arbitrary p ≥ 0.

9. Prove that if ρ is a metric for S, then another metric ρ′ for S is given
by
(i) ρ′ (x, y) = min{1, ρ(x, y)};
ρ(x, y)
(ii) ρ′ (x, y) =

1 + ρ(x, y)
In case (i), show that globes Gp (ε) of radius ε ≤ 1 are the same under ρ
and ρ′ . In case (ii), prove that any Gp (ε) in (S, ρ) is also a globe Gp (ε′ )
in (S, ρ′ ) of radius

ε′ =

and any globe of radius ε′ < 1 in (S, ρ′ ) is also a globe in (S, ρ). (Find
the converse formula for ε as well!)

10. Prove that if (X, ρ′ ) and (Y, ρ′′ ) are metric spaces, then a metric ρ for
the set X × Y is obtained by setting, for x1 , x2 ∈ X and y1 , y2 ∈ Y ,
(i) ρ((x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 )) = max{ρ′ (x1 , x2 ), ρ′′ (y1 , y2 )}; or

|ρ(y, z) − ρ(x, z)| ≤ ρ(x, y)

[Caution: The formula ρ(x, y) = |x−y|, valid in E n , cannot be used in (S, ρ). Why?]

12. Prove that
ρ(p1 , p2 ) + ρ(p2 , p3 ) + · · · + ρ(pn−1 , pn ) ≥ ρ(p1 , pn ).

§12. Open and Closed Sets. Neighborhoods
I. Let A be an open globe in (S, ρ) or an open interval (ā, b̄) in E n . Then
every p ∈ A can be enclosed in a small globe Gp (δ) ⊆ A (Figures 7 and 8).
(This would fail for “boundary” points; but there are none inside an open Gq
or (ā, b̄).)

This suggests the following ideas, for any (S, ρ).
Definition 1.
A point p is said to be interior to a set A ⊆ (S, ρ) iff A contains some
Gp ; i.e., p, together with some globe Gp , belongs to A. We then also say
that A is a neighborhood of p. The set of all interior points of A (“the
interior of A”) is denoted A0 . Note: ∅0 = ∅ and S 0 = S.1
Definition 2.
A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is said to be open iff A coincides with its interior
(A0 = A). Such are ∅ and S.
1

Indeed, ∅ has no points at all, and hence no interior points; i.e., ∅0 is void. On the other
hand, S contains any Gp . Thus any p is interior to S; i.e., S 0 = S.

102

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Examples.
(1) As noted above, an open globe Gq (r) has interior points only, and thus
is an open set in the sense of Definition 2. (See Problem 1 for a proof.)
(2) The same applies to an open interval (ā, b̄) in E n . (See Problem 2.)
(3) The interior of any interval in E n never includes its endpoints ā and b̄.
In fact, it coincides with the open interval (ā, b̄). (See Problem 4.)
(4) The set R of all rationals in E 1 has no interior points at all (R0 = ∅)
because it cannot contain any Gp = (p − ε, p + ε). Indeed, any such
Gp contains irrationals (see Chapter 2, §§11–12, Problem 5), so it is not
entirely contained in R.
Theorem 1 (Hausdorff property2 ). Any two points p and q (p 6= q) in (S, ρ)
are centers of two disjoint globes.
More precisely,
(∃ ε > 0) Gp (ε) ∩ Gq (ε) = ∅.
Proof. As p 6= q, we have ρ(p, q) > 0 by metric axiom (i′ ). Thus we may put
1
ρ(p, q) > 0.
2
It remains to show that with this ε, Gp (ε) ∩ Gq (ε) = ∅.
Seeking a contradiction, suppose this fails. Then there is x ∈ Gp (ε) ∩ Gq (ε)
so that ρ(p, x) < ε and ρ(x, q) < ε. By the triangle law,
ε=

ρ(p, q) ≤ ρ(p, x) + ρ(x, q) < ε + ε = 2ε; i.e., ρ(p, q) < 2ε,
which is impossible since ρ(p, q) = 2ε. 

reader is advised to use such diagrams in E 2 as a guide.
II. We can now define closed sets in terms of open sets.

§12. Open and Closed Sets. Neighborhoods

Definition 3.
A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is said to be closed iff its complement −A = S − A is
open, i.e., has interior points only.
That is, each p ∈ −A (outside A) is in some globe Gp ⊆ −A so that
A ∩ Gp = ∅.
Examples (continued).
(5) The sets ∅ and S are closed, for their complements, S and ∅, are open, as
noted above. Thus a set may be both closed and open (“clopen”).
(6) All closed globes in (S, ρ) and all closed intervals in E n are closed sets by
Definition 3. Indeed (see Figures 9 and 10), if A = Gq (r) or A = [ā, b̄],
then any point p outside A can be enclosed in a globe Gp (δ) disjoint from
A; so, by Definition 3, A is closed (see Problem 12).
(7) A one-point set {q} (also called “singleton”) in (S, ρ) is always closed, for
any p outside {q} (p 6= q) is in a globe disjoint from {q} by Theorem 1.
In a discrete space (§11, Example (3)), {q} is also open since it is an
open globe, {q} = Gq ( 12 ) (why?); so it is “clopen.” Hence, in such a space,
all sets are “clopen”. For p ∈ A implies {p} = Gp ( 21 ) ⊆ A; similarly for
−A. Thus A and −A have interior points only, so both are open.
(8) The interval (a, b] in E 1 is neither open nor closed . (Why?)
∗

III. (The rest of this section may be deferred until Chapter 4, §10.)

Theorem 2. The union of any finite or infinite family of open sets Ai (i ∈ I),
denoted
[
Ai ,
i∈I

is open itself . So also is
n
\

Ai

i=1

for finitely many open sets. (This fails for infinitely many sets Ai ; see Problem 11 below .)
S
Proof. We must show that any point p of A = i Ai is interior to A.
S
Now if p ∈ i Ai , p is in some Ai , and it is an interior point of Ai (for Ai
is open, by assumption). Thus there is a globe
Gp ⊆ Ai ⊆ A,
as required.

104

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

For finite intersections, it suffices to consider two open sets A and B (for
n sets, all then follows by induction). We must show that each p ∈ A ∩ B is
interior to A ∩ B.
Now as p ∈ A and A is open, we have some Gp (δ ′ ) ⊆ A. Similarly, there is
Gp (δ ′′ ) ⊆ B. Then the smaller of the two globes, call it Gp , is in both A and
B, so
Gp ⊆ A ∩ B
and p is interior to A ∩ B, indeed. 
Theorem 3. If the sets Ai (i ∈ I) are closed, so is
\
Ai
i∈I

(even for infinitely many sets). So also is
n
[

Ai

i=1

for finitely many closed sets Ai . (Again, this fails for infinitely many sets Ai .)
T
Proof. Let A = i∈I Ai . To prove that A is closed, we show that −A is open.
Now by set theory (see Chapter 1, §§1–3, Theorem 2),
\
[
−A = − Ai = (−Ai ),
i

i

where the (−Ai ) are open (for the Ai are closed). Thus by Theorem 2, −A is
open, as required.
Sn
The second assertion (as to i=1 Ai ) follows quite similarly. 

Corollary 1. A nonempty set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is open iff A is a union of open
globes.
For if A is such a union, it is open by Theorem 2. Conversely, if A is open,
then S
each p ∈ A is inS some Gp ⊆ A. All such Gp (p ∈ A) cover all of A, so
A ⊆ p∈A Gp . Also, p∈A Gp ⊆ A since all Gp are in A. Thus
[
A=
Gp .

Corollary 2. Every finite set F in a metric space (S, ρ) is closed .
Proof. If F = ∅, F is closed by Example (5). If F 6= ∅, let
F = {p1 , . . . , pn } =

n

{pk }.

Now by Example (7), each {pk } is closed; hence so is F by Theorem 3.

§12. Open and Closed Sets. Neighborhoods

Note. The family of all open sets in a given space (S, ρ) is denoted by G;
that of all closed sets, by F. Thus “A ∈ G” means that A is open; “A ∈ F”
means that A is closed . By Theorems 2 and 3, we have
(∀ A, B ∈ G) A ∪ B ∈ G and A ∩ B ∈ G;
similarly for F. This is a kind of “closure law.” We say that F and G are
“closed under finite unions and intersections.”
In conclusion, consider any subspace (A, ρ) of (S, ρ). As we know from §11,
it is a metric space itself, so it has its own open and closed sets (which must
consist of points of A only). We shall now show that they are obtained from
those of (S, ρ) by intersecting the latter sets with A.
Theorem 4. Let (A, ρ) be a subspace of (S, ρ). Then the open (closed ) sets
in (A, ρ) are exactly all sets of the form A ∩ U , with U open (closed ) in S.
Proof. Let G be open in (A, ρ). By Corollary 1, G is the union of some open
globes G∗i (i ∈ I) in (A, ρ). (For brevity, we omit the centers and radii; we
also omit the trivial case G = ∅.)
As was shown in §11, however, G∗i = A ∩ Gi , where Gi is an open globe in
(S, ρ). Thus
[
[
[
G=
G∗i = (A ∩ Gi ) = A ∩
Gi ,
i

i

i

by set theory (see Chapter 1, §§1–3, Problem 9).
S
Again by Corollary 1, U = i Gi is an open set in (S, ρ). Thus G has the
form
[
A ∩ Gi = A ∩ U,
i

with U open in S, as asserted.
Conversely, assume the latter, and let p ∈ G. Then p ∈ A and p ∈ U . As
U is open in (S, ρ), there is a globe Gp in (S, ρ) such that p ∈ Gp ⊆ U . As
p ∈ A, we have
p ∈ A ∩ Gp ⊆ A ∩ U.
However, A ∩ Gp is a globe in (A, ρ), call it G∗p . Thus
p ∈ G∗p ⊆ A ∩ U = G;
i.e., p is an interior point of G in (A, ρ). We see that each p ∈ G is interior to
G, as a set in (A, ρ), so G is open in (A, ρ).
This proves the theorem for open sets. Now let F be closed in (A, ρ). Then
by Definition 3, A − F is open in (A, ρ). (Of course, when working in (A, ρ),
we replace S by A in taking complements.) Let G = A − F , so F = A − G, and
G is open in (A, ρ). By what was shown above, G = A ∩ U with U open in S.

106

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Thus
F = A − G = A − (A ∩ U ) = A − U = A ∩ (−U )
by set theory. Here −U = S − U is closed in (S, ρ) since U is open there. Thus
F = A ∩ (−U ), as required.
The proof of the converse (for closed sets) is left as an exercise. 

§13. Bounded Sets. Diameters
I. Geometrically, the diameter of a closed globe in E n could be defined as
the maximum distance between two of its points. In an open globe in E n , there
is no “maximum” distance (why?), but we still may consider the supremum of
all distances inside the globe. Moreover, this makes sense in any set A ⊆ (S, ρ).
Thus we accept it as a general definition, for any such set.

109

§13. Bounded Sets. Diameters

Definition 1.
The diameter of a set A 6= ∅ in a metric space (S, ρ), denoted dA, is the
supremum (in E ∗ ) of all distances ρ(x, y), with x, y ∈ A;1 in symbols,
dA = sup ρ(x, y).
x, y∈A

If A = ∅, we put dA = 0. If dA < +∞, A is said to be bounded (in
(S, ρ)).
Equivalently, we could define a bounded set as in the statement of the following theorem.

Proof. If A = ∅, all is trivial.
Thus let A 6= ∅; let q ∈ A, and choose
any p ∈ S. Now if A is bounded, then
dA < +∞, so we can choose a real ε >
ρ(p, q)+dA as a suitable radius for a globe
Gp (ε) ⊇ A (see Figure 11 for motivation).
Now if x ∈ A, then by the definition of dA,
ρ(q, x) ≤ dA; so by the triangle law,

ε

Theorem 1. A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is bounded iff A is contained in some globe. If
so, the center p of this globe can be chosen at will .

A
p

ρ(p, x) ≤ ρ(p, q) + ρ(q, x)

q

Figure 11

≤ ρ(p, q) + dA < ε;

i.e., x ∈ Gp (ε). Thus (∀ x ∈ A) x ∈ Gp (ε),
as required.
Conversely, if A ⊆ Gp (ε), then any x, y ∈ A are also in Gp (ε); so ρ(x, p) < ε
and ρ(p, y) < ε, whence
ρ(x, y) ≤ ρ(x, p) + ρ(p, y) < ε + ε = 2ε.
Thus 2ε is an upper bound of all ρ(x, y) with x, y ∈ A. Therefore,
dA = sup ρ(x, y) ≤ 2ε < +∞;
i.e., A is bounded, and all is proved. 
As a special case we obtain the following.
Theorem 2. A set A ⊆ E n is bounded iff there is a real K > 0 such that
(∀ x̄ ∈ A)

|x̄| < K

(∗ similarly in C n and other normed spaces).
1

Recall that the supremum always exists in E ∗ (finite or not); see Chapter 2, §13.

110

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Proof. By Theorem 1 (choosing 0̄ for p), A is bounded iff A is contained in
some globe G0̄ (ε) about 0̄. That is,
(∀ x̄ ∈ A)

x̄ ∈ G0̄ (ε) or ρ(x̄, 0̄) = |x̄| < ε.

Thus ε is the required K. (∗ The proof for normed spaces is the same.) 
Note 1. In E 1 , this means that
(∀ x ∈ A)

− K < x < K;

i.e., A is bounded by −K and K. This agrees with our former definition, given
in Chapter 2, §§8–9.
Caution: Upper and lower bounds are not defined in (S, ρ), in general.
Examples.
(1) ∅ is bounded, with d∅ = 0, by definition.

(2) Let A = [ā, b̄] in E n , with d = ρ(ā, b̄) its diagonal. By Corollary 1 in §7,
d is the largest distance in A. In nonclosed intervals, we still have
d = sup ρ(x, y) = dA < +∞ (see Problem 10(ii)).
x, y∈A

Thus all intervals in E n are bounded .
(3) Each globe Gp (ε) in (S, ρ) is bounded, with dGp (ε) ≤ 2ε < +∞, as was
shown in the proof of Theorem 1. See, however, Problems 5 and 6 below.
(4) All of E n is not bounded, under the standard metric, for if E n had a finite
diameter d, no distance in E n would exceed d; but ρ(−dē1 , dē1 ) = 2d, a
contradiction!
(5) On the other hand, under the discrete metric (§11, Example (3)), any set
(even the entire space) is contained in Gp (3) and hence bounded. The
same applies to the metric ρ′ defined for E ∗ in Problem 5 of §11, since
distances under that metric never exceed 2, and so E ∗ ⊆ Gp (3) for any
choice of p.
Note 2. This shows that boundedness depends on the metric ρ. A set may
be bounded under one metric and not bounded under another. A metric ρ is
said to be bounded iff all sets are bounded under ρ (as in Example (5)).
Problem 9 of §11 shows that any metric ρ can be transformed into a bounded
one, even preserving all sufficiently small globes; in part (i) of the problem, even
the radii remain the same if they are ≤ 1.
Note 3. An idea similar to that of diameter is often used to define distances
between sets. If A 6= ∅ and B 6= ∅ in (S, ρ), we define ρ(A, B) to be the infimum
of all distances ρ(x, y), with x ∈ A and y ∈ B. In particular, if B = {p} (a

111

§13. Bounded Sets. Diameters

singleton), we write ρ(A, p) for ρ(A, B). Thus
ρ(A, p) = inf ρ(x, p).
x∈A

II. The definition of boundedness extends, in a natural manner, to sequences
and functions. We briefly write {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) for a sequence of points in (S, ρ),
and f : A → (S, ρ) for a mapping of an arbitrary set A into the space S. Instead
of “infinite sequence with general term xm ,” we say “the sequence xm .”
Definition 2.
A sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) is said to be bounded iff its range is bounded
in (S, ρ), i.e., iff all its terms xm are contained in some globe in (S, ρ).
In E n , this means (by Theorem 2) that
(∀ m)

|xm | < K

for some fixed K ∈ E 1 .2
Definition 3.
A function f : A → (S, ρ) is said to be bounded on a set B ⊆ A iff the
image set f [B] is bounded in (S, ρ); i.e. iff all function values f (x), with
x ∈ B, are in some globe in (S, ρ).
In E n , this means that
(∀ x ∈ B) |f (x)| < K
for some fixed K ∈ E 1 .2
If B = A, we simply say that f is bounded .
Note 4. If S = E 1 or S = E ∗ , we may also speak of upper and lower
bounds. It is customary to call sup f [B] also the supremum of f on B and
denote it by symbols like
sup f (x) or sup{f (x) | x ∈ B}.

x∈B

In the case of sequences, we often write supm xm or sup xm instead; similarly
for infima, maxima, and minima.
Examples.
(a) The sequence
xm =

1
m

in E 1

is bounded since all terms xm are in the interval (0, 2) = G1 (1). We have
inf xm = 0 and sup xm = max xm = 1.
2 ∗ Similarly

in C n and other normed spaces.

112

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

(b) The sequence
xm = m in E 1
is bounded below (by 1) but not above. We have inf xm = min xm = 1
and sup xm = +∞ (in E ∗ ).
(c) Define f : E 1 → E 1 by

f (x) = 2x.

This map is bounded on each finite interval B = (a, b) since f [B] =
(2a, 2b) is itself an interval and hence bounded. However, f is not
bounded on all of E 1 since f [E 1 ] = E 1 is not a bounded set.
(d) Under a bounded metric ρ, all functions f : A → (S, ρ) are bounded.
(e) The so-called identity map on S, f : S → (S, ρ), is defined by
f (x) = x.
Clearly, f carries each set B ⊆ S onto itself; i.e., f [B] = B. Thus f is
bounded on B iff B is itself a bounded set in (S, ρ).
(f) Define f : E 1 → E 1 by

f (x) = sin x.

Then f [E 1 ] = [−1, 1] is a bounded set in the range space E 1 . Thus f is
bounded on E 1 (briefly, bounded ).

§14. Cluster Points. Convergent Sequences

i.e., xm ∈ (−ε, ε) = G0 (ε).
This suggests the following generalizations.
Definition 1.
A set, or sequence, A ⊆ (S, ρ) is said to cluster at a point p ∈ S (not
necessarily p ∈ A), and p is called its cluster point or accumulation point,
iff every globe Gp about p contains infinitely many points (respectively,
terms) of A. (Thus only infinite sets can cluster .)
Note 1. In sequences (unlike sets) an infinitely repeating term counts as
infinitely many terms. For example, the sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, . . . clusters at 0
and 1 (why?); but its range, {0, 1}, has no cluster points (being finite). This
distinction is, however, irrelevant if all terms xm are distinct, i.e., different from
each other. Then we may treat sequences and sets alike.
Definition 2.
A sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) is said to converge or tend to a point p in S,
and p is called its limit, iff every globe Gp (ε) about p (no matter how
small) contains all but finitely many terms xm .2 In symbols,
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

xm ∈ Gp (ε), i.e., ρ(xm , p) < ε.

(1)

If such a p exists, we call {xm } a convergent sequence (in (S, ρ));
otherwise, a divergent one. The notation is
xm → p, or lim xm = p, or lim xm = p.
m→∞

In E n ,3 ρ(x̄m , p̄) = |x̄m − p̄|; thus formula (1) turns into
x̄m → p̄ in E n iff (∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

|x̄m − p̄| < ε.

(2)

Since “all but finitely many” (as in Definition 2) implies “infinitely many” (as
in Definition 1), any limit is also a cluster point. Moreover, we obtain the
following result.
Corollary 1. If xm → p, then p is the unique cluster point of {xm }. (Thus a
sequence with two or more cluster points, or none at all , diverges.)
For if p 6= q, the Hausdorff property (Theorem 1 of §12) yields an ε such
that
Gp (ε) ∩ Gq (ε) = ∅.
As xm → p, Gp (ε) leaves out at most finitely many xm , and only these can
possibly be in Gq (ε). (Why?) Thus q fails to satisfy Definition 1 and hence is
no cluster point. Hence lim xm (if it exists) is unique.
2

That is, Gp (ε) leaves out at most finitely many terms xm , say, x1 , x2 , . . . , xk , whereas
in Definition 1, Gp (ε) may leave out even infinitely many points of A.
3 ∗ Similarly for sequences in C n and in other normed spaces (§10).

116

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Corollary 2.
(i) We have xm → p in (S, ρ) iff ρ(xm , p) → 0 in E 1 .
Hence
(ii) x̄m → p̄ in E n iff |x̄m − p̄| → 0 and

(iii) x̄m → 0̄ in E n iff |x̄m | → 0.

Proof. By (2), we have ρ(xm , p) → 0 in E 1 if
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

|ρ(xm , p) − 0| = ρ(xm , p) < ε.

By (1), however, this means that xm → p, proving our first assertion. The rest
easily follows from it, since ρ(x̄m , p̄) = |x̄m − p̄| in E n . 
Corollary 3. If xm tends to p, then so does each subsequence xmk .
For xm → p means that each Gp leaves out at most finitely many xm . This
certainly still holds if we drop some terms, passing to {xmk }.
Note 2. A similar argument shows that the convergence or divergence of
{xm }, and its limit or cluster points, are not affected by dropping or adding
a finite number of terms; similarly for cluster points of sets. For example, if
{xm } tends to p, so does {xm+1 } (the same sequence without x1 ).
We leave the following two corollaries as exercises.
Corollary 4. If {xm } splits into two subsequences, each tending to the same
limit p, then also xm → p.

Corollary 5. If {xm } converges in (S, ρ), it is bounded there. (See Problem 4.)

Of course, the convergence or divergence of {xm } and its clustering depend
on the metric ρ and the space S. Our theory applies to any (S, ρ). In particular, it applies to E ∗ , with the metric ρ′ of Problem 5 in §11. Recall that under
that metric, globes about ±∞ have the form (a, +∞] and [−∞, a), respectively. Thus limits and cluster points in (E ∗ , ρ′ ) coincide with those defined
in Chapter 2, §13, (formulas (1)–(3) and Definition 2 there).4 Our theory then
applies to infinite limits as well, and generalizes Chapter 2, §13.
Examples.
(a) Let
xm = p

for all m

(such sequences are called constant). As p ∈ Gp , any Gp contains all
xm . Thus xm → p, by Definition 2. We see that each constant sequence
converges to the common value of its terms.

The second part of Chapter 2, §13, should be reviewed at this stage.

0∈

(c) The sequence

0, 1, 0, 1, . . .
has two cluster points, 0 and 1, so it diverges by Corollary 1. (It “oscillates” from 0 to 1.) This shows that a bounded sequence may diverge.
The converse to Corollary 5 fails.
(d) The sequence
xm = m
(or the set N of all naturals) has no cluster points in E 1 , for a globe of
radius < 12 (with any center p ∈ E 1 ) contains at most one xm , and hence
no p satisfies Definition 1 or 2.
However, {xm } does cluster in (E ∗ , ρ′ ), and even has a limit there,
namely +∞. (Prove it!)
(e) The set R of all rationals in E 1 clusters at each p ∈ E 1 . Indeed, any
globe
Gp (ε) = (p − ε, p + ε)
contains infinitely many rationals (see Chapter 2, §10, Theorem 3), and
this means that each p ∈ E 1 is a cluster point of R.

Corollary 5). In (E ∗ , ρ′ ), it has two cluster points, 0 and +∞. (Verify!)
(g) The lim and lim of any sequence in E ∗ are cluster points (cf. Chapter 2,
§13, Theorem 2 and Problem 4). Thus in E ∗ , all sequences cluster .

(h) Let

A = [a, b],

a < b.

Then A clusters exactly at all its points, for if p ∈ A, then any globe
Gp (ε) = (p − ε, p + ε)
overlaps with A (even with (a, b)) and so contains infinitely many points
of A, as required. Even the endpoints a and b are cluster points of A (and

118

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

of (a, b), (a, b], and [a, b)). On the other hand, no point outside A is a
cluster point. (Why?)
(i) In a discrete space (§11, Example (3)), no set can cluster, since small
globes, such as Gp ( 21 ), are singletons. (Explain!)
Example (h) shows that a set A may equal the set of its cluster points (call
it A′ ); i.e.,
A = A′ .
Such sets are said to be perfect. Sometimes we have A ⊆ A′ , A′ ⊆ A, A′ = S
(as in Example (e)), or A′ = ∅. We conclude with the following result.

Corollary 6. A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) clusters at p iff each globe Gp (about p) contains
at least one point of A other than p.5
Indeed, assume the latter. Then, in particular, each globe
1
Gp
, n = 1, 2, . . . ,
n
contains some point of A other than p; call it xn . We can make the xn distinct
by choosing each time xn+1 closer to p than xn is. It easily follows that each
Gp (ε) contains infinitely many points of A (the details are left to the reader),
as required. The converse is obvious.

Then the enlarged globe Gp (r) contains all xm . Use Theorem 1 in §13.]

§15. Operations on Convergent Sequences1
Sequences in E 1 and C can be added and multiplied termwise; for example,
adding {xm } and {ym }, one obtains the sequence with general term xm + ym .
This leads to important theorems, valid also for E n (∗ and other normed spaces).
Theorem 1 below states, roughly, that the limit of the sum {xm + ym } equals
the sum of lim xm and lim ym (if these exist), and similarly for products and
quotients (when they are defined).2
Theorem 1. Let xm → q, ym → r, and am → a in E 1 or C (the complex
field ). Then
(i) xm ± ym → q ± r;
1

This section (and the rest of this chapter) may be deferred until Chapter 4, §2. Then
Theorems 1 and 2 may be combined with the more general theorems of Chapter 4, §3. (It is
rather a matter of taste which to do first.)
2 Theorem 1 is known as “continuity of addition, multiplication, and division” (for reasons
to be clarified later). Note the restriction a 6= 0 in (iii).

121

§15. Operations on Convergent Sequences

(ii) am xm → aq;
q
xm
→ if a 6= 0 and for all m ≥ 1, am 6= 0.
(iii)
am
a
This also holds if the xm , ym , q, and r are vectors in E n (∗ or in another normed
space), while the am and a are scalars for that space.
Proof. (i) By formula (2) of §14, we must show that
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

|xm ± ym − (q ± r)| < ε.

Thus we fix an arbitrary ε > 0 and look for a suitable k. Since xm → q and
ym → r, there are k ′ and k ′′ such that
ε
(∀ m > k ′ ) |xm − q| <
2
and
ε
(∀ m > k ′′ ) |ym − r| <
2
(as ε is arbitrary, we may as well replace it by 21 ε). Then both inequalities hold
for m > k, k = max(k ′ , k ′′ ). Adding them, we obtain
(∀ m > k)

|xm − q| + |ym − r| < ε.

Hence by the triangle law,
|xm − q ± (ym − r)| < ε, i.e., |xm ± ym − (q ± r)| < ε for m > k,
as required. 
This proof of (i) applies to sequences of vectors as well, without any change.
The proof of (ii) and (iii) is sketched in Problems 1–4 below.
Note 1. By induction, parts (i) and (ii) hold for sums and products of any
finite (but fixed) number of suitable convergent sequences.
Note 2. The theorem does not apply to infinite limits q, r, a.
Note 3. The assumption a 6= 0 in Theorem 1(iii) is important. It ensures
not only that q/a is defined but also that at most finitely many am can vanish
(see Problem 3). Since we may safely drop a finite number of terms (see Note 2
in §14), we can achieve that no am is 0, so that xm /am is defined . It is with
this understanding that part (iii) of the theorem has been formulated. The
next two theorems are actually special cases of more general propositions to be
proved in Chapter 4, §§3 and 5. Therefore, we only state them here, leaving
the proofs as exercises, with some hints provided.
Theorem 2 (componentwise convergence). We have x̄m → p̄ in E n (∗ C n ) iff
each of the n components of x̄m tends to the corresponding component of p̄,
i .e., iff xmk → pk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n, in E 1 (C). (See Problem 8 for hints.)

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Theorem 3. Every monotone sequence {xn } ⊆ E ∗ has a finite or infinite
limit, which equals supn xn if {xn }↑ and inf n xn if {xn }↓. If {xn } is monotone
and bounded in E 1 , its limit is finite (by Corollary 1 of Chapter 2, §13).

The proof was requested in Problem 9 of Chapter 2, §13. See also Chapter 4,
§5, Theorem 1. An important application is the following.

Example (the number e).


Let xn = 1 +

If n is replaced by n + 1, all terms in this expansion increase, as does

Thus 2 < xn < 3 for n > 1. Hence 2 < supn xn ≤ 3; and by Theorem 3,
supn xn = lim xn . This limit, denoted by e, plays an important role in
analysis. It can be shown that it is irrational, and (to within 10−20 )
e = 2.71828182845904523536 . . . . In any case,

The following corollaries are left as exercises for the reader.
Corollary 1. Suppose lim xm = p and lim ym = q exist in E ∗ .
(a) If p > q, then xm > ym for all but finitely many m.
(b) If xm ≤ ym for infinitely many m, then p ≤ q; i .e., lim xm ≤ lim ym .
This is known as passage to the limit in inequalities. Caution: The strict
inequalities xm < ym do not imply p < q but only p ≤ q. For example, let
xm =

1
and ym = 0.

§15. Operations on Convergent Sequences

Then
(∀ m)

xm > y m ;

yet lim xm = lim ym = 0.
Corollary 2. Let xm → p in E ∗ , and let c ∈ E ∗ (finite or not). Then the
following are true:
(a) If p > c (respectively, p < c), we have xm > c (xm < c) for all but finitely
many m.
(b) If xm ≤ c (respectively, xm ≥ c) for infinitely many m, then p ≤ c (p ≥ c).
One can prove this from Corollary 1, with ym = c (or xm = c) for all m.
Corollary 3 (rule of intermediate sequence). If xm → p and ym → p in E ∗
and if xm ≤ zm ≤ ym for all but finitely many m, then also zm → p.

Theorem 4 (continuity of the distance function). If

xm → p and ym → q in a metric space (S, ρ),
then
ρ(xm , ym ) → ρ(p, q) in E 1 .
Hint: Show that
|ρ(xm , ym ) − ρ(p, q)| ≤ ρ(xm , p) + ρ(q, ym ) → 0
by Theorem 1.

Problems on Limits of Sequences
See also Chapter 2, §13.

1. Prove that if xm → 0 and if {am } is bounded in E 1 or C, then
am xm → 0.
This is true also if the xm are vectors and the am are scalars (or vice
versa).
[Hint: If {am } is bounded, there is a K ∈ E 1 such that

As xm → 0,

|am | < K.

so |am xm | < ε.]

2. Prove Theorem 1(ii).
[Hint: By Corollary 2(ii)(iii) in §14, we must show that am xm − aw → 0. Now
am xm − aq = am (xm − q) + (am − a)q,

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces
where xm − q → 0 and am − a → 0 by Corollary 2 of §14. Hence by Problem 1,
am (xm − q) → 0 and (am − a)q → 0
(treat q as a constant sequence and use Corollary 5 in §14). Now apply Theorem 1(i).]

3. Prove that if am → a and a 6= 0 in E 1 or C, then
(∃ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

|am | ≥ ε.

(We briefly say that the am are bounded away from 0, for m > k.) Hence
prove the boundedness of { a1m } for m > k.

does not apply to infinite limits.) As a remedy, we first divide the numerator and

§16. More on Cluster Points and Closed Sets. Density
I. The notions of cluster point and closed set (§§12, 14) can be characterized
in terms of convergent sequences. We start with cluster points.
Theorem 1.
(i) A sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) clusters at a point p ∈ S iff it has a subsequence
{xmn } converging to p.1

(ii) A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) clusters at p ∈ S iff p is the limit of some sequence {xn }
of points of A other than p; if so, the terms xn can be made distinct.

Proof. (i) If p = limn→∞ xmn , then by definition each globe about p contains
all but finitely many xmn , hence infinitely many xm . Thus p is a cluster point.
Conversely, if so, consider in particular the globes
1
Gp
, n = 1, 2, . . . .
n

By assumption, Gp (1) contains some xm . Thus fix
xm1 ∈ Gp (1).
Next, choose a term
xm2 ∈ Gp

1
2

with m2 > m1 .

(Such terms exist since Gp ( 12 ) contains infinitely many xm .) Next, fix
1
xm3 ∈ Gp
, with m3 > m2 > m1 ,
3
and so on.
Thus, step by step (inductively), select a sequence of subscripts
m1 < m2 < · · · < mn < · · ·
that determines a subsequence (see Chapter 1, §8) such that
1
1
(∀ n) xmn ∈ Gp
, i.e., ρ(xmn , p) < → 0,
n
n
1

Therefore, cluster points of {xm } are also called subsequential limits.

136

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

whence ρ(xmn , p) → 0, or xmn → p. (Why?) Thus we have found a subsequence xmn → p, and assertion (i) is proved.
Assertion (ii) is proved quite similarly—proceed as in the proof of Corollary 6
in §14; the inequalities m1 < m2 < · · · are not needed here. 
Examples.
(a) Recall that the set R of all rationals clusters at each p ∈ E 1 (§14,
Example (e)). Thus by Theorem 1(ii), each real p is the limit of a sequence of rationals. See also Problem 6 of §12 for p̄ in E n .

(b) The sequence

0, 1, 0, 1, . . .
has two convergent subsequences,
x2n = 1 → 1 and x2n−1 = 0 → 0.
Thus by Theorem 1(i), it clusters at 0 and 1.
Interpret Example (f) and Problem 10(a) in §14 similarly.
As we know, even infinite sets may have no cluster points (take N in E 1 ).
However, a bounded infinite set or sequence in E n (∗ or C n ) must cluster. This
important theorem (due to Bolzano and Weierstrass) is proved next.
Theorem 2 (Bolzano–Weierstrass).
(i) Each bounded infinite set or sequence A in E n (∗ or C n ) has at least one
cluster point p̄ there (possibly outside A).
(ii) Thus each bounded sequence in E n (∗ C n ) has a convergent subsequence.
Proof. Take first a bounded sequence {zm } ⊆ [a, b] in E 1 . Let
p = lim zm .
By Theorem 2(i) of Chapter 2, §13, {zm } clusters at p. Moreover, as
a ≤ zm ≤ b,
we have
a ≤ inf zm ≤ p ≤ sup zm ≤ b
by Corollary 1 of Chapter 2, §13. Thus

p ∈ [a, b] ⊆ E 1 ,

and so {zm } clusters in E 1 .
Assertion (ii) now follows—for E 1 —by Theorem 1(i) above.
Next, take
{z̄m } ⊆ E 2 , z̄m = (xm , ym ); xm , ym ∈ E 1 .

§16. More on Cluster Points and Closed Sets. Density

137

If {z̄m } is bounded, all z̄m are in some square [ā, b̄]. (Why?) Let
ā = (a1 , a2 ) and b̄ = (b1 , b2 ).
Then
a1 ≤ xm ≤ b1 and a2 ≤ ym ≤ b2 in E 1 .
Thus by the first part of the proof, {xm } has a convergent subsequence
xmk → p1 for some p1 ∈ [a1 , b1 ].
For simplicity, we henceforth write xm for xmk , ym for ymk , and z̄m for z̄mk .
Thus z̄m = (xm , ym ) is now a subsequence, with xm → p1 , and a2 ≤ ym ≤ b2 ,
as before.
We now reapply this process to {ym } and obtain a subsubsequence
ymi → p2 for some p2 ∈ [a2 , b2 ].
The corresponding terms xmi still tend to p1 by Corollary 3 of §14. Thus we
have a subsequence
z̄mi = (xmi , ymi ) → (p1 , p2 ) in E 2
by Theorem 2 in §15. Hence p̄ = (p1 , p2 ) is a cluster point of {z̄m }. Note that
p̄ ∈ [ā, b̄] (see above). This proves the theorem for sequences in E 2 (hence in
C).
The proof for E n is similar; one only has to take subsequences n times.
(∗ The same applies to C n with real components replaced by complex ones.)
Now take a bounded infinite set A ⊂ E n (∗ C n ). Select from it an infinite
sequence {z̄m } of distinct points (see Chapter 1, §9, Problem 5). By what was
shown above, {z̄m } clusters at some point p̄, so each Gp̄ contains infinitely
many distinct points z̄m ∈ A. Thus by definition, A clusters at p̄. 
Note 1. We have also proved that if {z̄m } ⊆ [ā, b̄] ⊂ E n , then {z̄m } has a
cluster point in [ā, b̄]. (This applies to closed intervals only.)
Note 2. The theorem may fail in spaces other than E n (∗ C n ). For example,
in a discrete space, all sets are bounded, but no set can cluster.
II. Cluster points are closely related to the following notion.
Definition 1.
The closure of a set A ⊆ (S, ρ), denoted A, is the union of A and the set
of all cluster points of A (call it A′ ). Thus A = A ∪ A′ .
Theorem 3. We have p ∈ A in (S, ρ) iff each globe Gp (δ) about p meets A,
i .e.,
(∀ δ > 0) A ∩ Gp (δ) 6= ∅.

138

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Equivalently, p ∈ A iff
p = lim xn for some {xn } ⊆ A.
n→∞

The proof is as in Corollary 6 of §14 and Theorem 1. (Here, however, the
xn need not be distinct or different from p.) The details are left to the reader.
This also yields the following new characterization of closed sets (cf. §12).
Theorem 4. A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is closed iff one of the following conditions
holds.
(i) A contains all its cluster points (or has none); i .e., A ⊇ A′ .
(ii) A = A.
(iii) A contains the limit of each convergent sequence {xn } ⊆ A (if any).2
Proof. Parts (i) and (ii) are equivalent since
A ⊇ A′ ⇐⇒ A = A ∪ A′ = A. (Explain!)
Now let A be closed. If p ∈
/ A, then p ∈ −A; therefore, by Definition 3 in
§12, some Gp fails to meet A (Gp ∩A = ∅). Hence no p ∈ −A is a cluster point,
or the limit of a sequence {xn } ⊆ A. (This would contradict Definitions 1 and
2 of §14.) Consequently, all such cluster points and limits must be in A, as
claimed.
Conversely, suppose A is not closed, so −A is not open. Then −A has a
noninterior point p; i.e., p ∈ −A but no Gp is entirely in −A. This means that
each Gp meets A. Thus
p ∈ A (by Theorem 3),
and
p = lim xn for some {xn } ⊆ A (by the same theorem),
n→∞

even though p ∈
/ A (for p ∈ −A).
We see that (iii) and (ii), hence also (i), fail if A is not closed and hold if A
is closed. (See the first part of the proof.) Thus the theorem is proved. 
The following corollaries are left as exercises (see Problems 6–9).
Corollary 1. ∅ = ∅.

Corollary 2. A ⊆ B =⇒ A ⊆ B.

Corollary 3. A is always a closed set ⊇ A.
2

Property (iii) is often called the sequential closedness of A.

§16. More on Cluster Points and Closed Sets. Density

139

Corollary 4. A ∪ B = A ∪ B (the closure of A ∪ B equals the union of A and
B).
III. As we know, the rationals are dense in E 1 (Theorem 3 of Chapter 2,
§10). This means that every globe Gp (δ) = (p − δ, p + δ) in E 1 contains
rationals. Similarly (see Problem 6 in §12), the set Rn of all rational points is
dense in E n . We now generalize this idea for arbitrary sets in a metric space
(S, ρ).
Definition 2.
Given A ⊆ B ⊆ (S, ρ), we say that A is dense in B iff each globe Gp ,
p ∈ B, meets A. By Theorem 3, this means that each p ∈ B is in A; i.e.,
p = lim xn
n→∞

for some {xn } ⊆ A.

Equivalently, A ⊆ B ⊆ A.3
Summing up, we have the following:
A is open iff A = A0 .
A is closed iff A = A; equivalently, iff A ⊇ A′ .
A is dense in B iff A ⊆ B ⊆ A.
A is perfect iff A = A′ .4

(∀ x ∈ S)

ρ(x, A) = 0 =⇒ x ∈ A.

§17. Cauchy Sequences. Completeness
A convergent sequence is characterized by the fact that its terms xm become
(and stay) arbitrarily close to its limit, as m → +∞. Due to this, however, they
also get close to each other ; in fact, ρ(xm , xn ) can be made arbitrarily small
for sufficiently large m and n. It is natural to ask whether the latter property,
in turn, implies the existence of a limit. This problem was first studied by
Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857). Thus we shall call such sequences Cauchy
sequences. More precisely, we formulate the following.
Definition 1.
A sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) is called a Cauchy sequence (we briefly say
that “{xm } is Cauchy”) iff, given any ε > 0 (no matter how small), we
have ρ(xm , xn ) < ε for all but finitely many m and n. In symbols,
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m, n > k)

ρ(xm , xn ) < ε.

(1)

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Observe that here we only deal with terms xm , xn , not with any other point.
The limit (if any) is not involved, and we do not have to know it in advance.
We shall now study the relationship between property (1) and convergence.
Theorem 1. Every convergent sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) is Cauchy.

Proof. Let xm → p. Then given ε > 0, there is a k such that
ε
(∀ m > k) ρ(xm , p) < .
2
As this holds for any m > k, it also holds for any other term xn with n > k.
Thus
ε
ε
(∀ m, n > k) ρ(xm , p) < and ρ(p, xn ) < .
2
2
Adding and using the triangle inequality, we get
ρ(xm , xn ) ≤ ρ(xm , p) + ρ(p, xn ) < ε,
and (1) is proved. 
Theorem 2. Every Cauchy sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) is bounded.

Proof. We must show that all xm are in some globe. First we try an arbitrary
radius ε. Then by (1), there is k such that ρ(xm , xn ) < ε for m, n > k. Fix
some n > k. Then
(∀ m > k) ρ(xm , xn ) < ε, i.e., xm ∈ Gxn (ε).
Thus the globe Gxn (ε) contains all xm except possibly the k terms x1 , . . . , xk .
To include them as well, we only have to take a larger radius r, greater than
ρ(xm , xn ), m = 1, . . . , k. Then all xm are in the enlarged globe Gxn (r). 
Note 1. In E 1 , under the standard metric, only sequences with finite limits
are regarded as convergent. If xn → ±∞, then {xn } is not even a Cauchy
sequence in E 1 (in view of Theorem 2); but in E ∗ , under a suitable metric
(cf. Problem 5 in §11), it is convergent (hence also Cauchy and bounded).

Theorem 3. If a Cauchy sequence {xm } clusters at a point p, then xm → p.

Proof. We want to show that xm → p, i.e., that
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

ρ(xm , p) < ε.

Thus we fix ε > 0 and look for a suitable k. Now as {xm } is Cauchy, there is
a k such that
ε
(∀ m, n > k) ρ(xm , xn ) < .
2
ε
Also, as p is a cluster point, the globe Gp ( 2 ) contains infinitely many xn , so we
can fix one with n > k (k as above). Then ρ(xn , p) < 2ε and, as noted above,
also ρ(xm , xn ) < 2ε for m > k. Hence
(∀ m > k)

ρ(xm , xn ) + ρ(xn , p) < ε,

§17. Cauchy Sequences. Completeness

143

implying ρ(xm , p) ≤ ρ(xm , xn ) + ρ(xn , p) < ε, as required. 
Note 2. It follows that a Cauchy sequence can have at most one cluster
point p, for p is also its limit and hence unique; see §14, Corollary 1.
These theorems show that Cauchy sequences behave very much like convergent ones. Indeed, our next theorem (a famous result by Cauchy) shows that,
in E n (∗ and C n ) the two kinds of sequences coincide.
Theorem 4 (Cauchy’s convergence criterion). A sequence {x̄m } in E n (∗ or
C n ) converges if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof. If {xm } converges, it is Cauchy by Theorem 1.
Conversely, let {xm } be a Cauchy sequence. Then by Theorem 2, it is
bounded. Hence by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (Theorem 2 of §16), it
has a cluster point p̄. Thus by Theorem 3 above, it converges to p̄, and all is
proved. 
Unfortunately, this theorem (along with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem
used in its proof) does not hold in all metric spaces. It even fails in some
subspaces of E 1 . For example, we have
1
→ 0 in E 1 .
m
By Theorem 1, this sequence, being convergent, is also a Cauchy sequence.
Moreover, it still preserves (1) even if we remove the point 0 from E 1 since
the distances ρ(xm , xn ) remain the same. However, in the resulting subspace
S = E 1 − {0}, the sequence no longer converges because its limit (and unique
cluster point) 0 has disappeared, leaving a “gap” in its place. Thus we have a
Cauchy sequence in S, without a limit or cluster points, so Theorem 4 fails in
S (along with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem).
Quite similarly, both theorems fail in (0, 1) (but not in [0, 1]) as a subspace
of E 1 . By analogy to incomplete ordered fields, it is natural to say that S
is “incomplete” because of the missing cluster point 0, and call a space (or
subspace) “complete” if it has no such “gaps,” i.e., if Theorem 4 holds in it.
Thus we define as follows.
xm =

Definition 2.
A metric space (or subspace) (S, ρ) is said to be complete iff every Cauchy
sequence in S converges to some point p in S.
Similarly, a set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is called complete iff each Cauchy sequence
{xm } ⊆ A converges to some point p in A, i.e., iff (A, ρ) is complete as a
metric subspace of (S, ρ).
In particular, E n (∗ and C n ) are complete by Theorem 4. The sets (0, 1)
and E 1 − {0} are incomplete in E 1 , but [0, 1] is complete. Indeed, we have the
following theorem.

144
∗

Chapter 3. Vector Spaces. Metric Spaces

Theorem 5.
(i) Every closed set in a complete space is complete itself .
(ii) Every complete set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is necessarily closed.1

Proof. (i) Let A be a closed set in a complete space (S, ρ). We have to show
that Theorem 4 holds in A (as it does in S). Thus we fix any Cauchy sequence
{xm } ⊆ A and prove that it converges to some p in A.
Now, since S is complete, the Cauchy sequence {xm } has a limit p in S. As
A is closed , however, that limit must be in A by Theorem 4 in §16. Thus (i)
is proved.
(ii) Now let A be complete in a metric space (S, ρ). To prove that A is
closed, we again use Theorem 4 of §16. Thus we fix any convergent sequence
{xm } ⊆ A, xm → p ∈ S, and show that p must be in A.
Now, since {xm } converges in S, it is a Cauchy sequence, in S as well as
in A. Thus by the assumed completeness of A, it has a limit q in A. Then,
however, the uniqueness of lim xm (in S) implies that p = q ∈ A, so that p is
m→∞
in A, indeed. 

Problems on Cauchy Sequences
1. Without using Theorem 4, prove that if {xn } and {yn } are Cauchy
sequences in E 1 (or C), so also are
(i) {xn + yn }

and

(ii) {xn yn }.

2. Prove that if {xm } and {ym } are Cauchy sequences in (S, ρ), then the
sequence of distances
ρ(xm , ym ),

m = 1, 2, . . . ,

converges in E 1 .
[Hint: Show that this sequence is Cauchy in E 1 ; then use Theorem 4.]

3. Prove that a sequence {xm } is Cauchy in (S, ρ) iff
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k) ρ(xm , xk ) < ε.
4. Two sequences {xm } and {ym } are called concurrent iff
ρ(xm , ym ) → 0.
Notation: {xm } ≈ {ym }. Prove the following.

(i) If one of them is Cauchy or convergent, so is the other, and
lim xm = lim ym (if it exists).

Also, show that if
(∀ m)

xm = a and ym = b (constant),

then ρ({xm }, {ym }) = ρ(a, b).

is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (Chapter 1, §§4–7), i.e., an equivalence relation. That is, given {xm }, {ym } in S, prove that
(a) {xm } ≈ {xm } (reflexivity);

(b) if {xm } ≈ {ym } then {ym } ≈ {xm } (symmetry);

(c) if {xm } ≈ {ym } and {ym } ≈ {zm }, then {xm } ≈ {zm } (transitivity).

5 . From Problem 4 deduce that the set of all sequences in (S, ρ) splits into
disjoint equivalence classes (as defined in Chapter 1, §§4–7) under the
relation of concurrence (≈). Show that all sequences of one and the
same class either converge to the same limit or have no limit at all, and
either none of them is Cauchy or all are Cauchy.
6. Give examples of incomplete metric spaces possessing complete subspaces.
7. Prove that if a sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ) is Cauchy then it has a subsequence {xmk } such that
(∀ k)

ρ(xmk , xmk+1 ) < 2−k .

By Problem 5, this is unambiguous, for ρ({xm }, {ym }) does not depend on the particular choice of {xm } ∈ X ∗ and {ym } ∈ Y ∗ ; and
lim ρ(xm , ym ) exists by Problem 2.
Show that σ is a metric for the set of all equivalence classes X ∗

10. Continuing Problem 9, let x∗ denote the equivalence class of the sequence with all terms equal to x; let C ′ be the set of all such “constant”
equivalence classes (it is a subset of C ∗ ).
Show that C ′ is dense in (C ∗ , σ), i.e., C ′ = C ∗ under the metric σ.

[Hint: Fix any “point” X ∗ ∈ C ∗ and any globe G(X ∗ ; ε) about X ∗ in (C ∗ , σ). We

Show that the spaces (S, ρ) and (C ′ , σ) of Problem 10 are isometric.
Note that it is customary not to distinguish between two isometric
spaces, treating each of them as just an “isometric copy” of the other.
Indeed, distances in each of them are alike.

Function Limits and Continuity

§1. Basic Definitions
We shall now consider functions whose domains and ranges are sets in some
fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) metric spaces (S, ρ) and (T, ρ′ ), respectively.
We write
f : A → (T, ρ′ )
for a function f with Df = A ⊆ (S, ρ) and Df′ ⊆ (T, ρ′ ). S is called the
domain space, and T the range space, of f .
I. Given such a function, we often have to investigate its “local behavior ”
near some point p ∈ S. In particular, if p ∈ A = Df (so that f (p) is defined ) we
may ask: Is it possible to make the function values f (x) as near as we like (“εnear”) to f (p) by keeping x sufficiently close (“δ-close”) to p, i.e., inside some
sufficiently small globe Gp (δ)?1 If this is the case, we say that f is continuous
at p. More precisely, we formulate the following definition.
Definition 1.
A function f : A → (T, ρ′ ), with A ⊆ (S, ρ), is said to be continuous at
p iff p ∈ A and, moreover, for each ε > 0 (no matter how small ) there is
δ > 0 such that ρ′ (f (x), f (p)) < ε for all x ∈ A ∩ Gp (δ). In symbols,
 ′
ρ (f (x), f (p)) < ε, or
(1)
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ A ∩ Gp (δ))
f (x) ∈ Gf (p) (ε).
If (1) fails, we say that f is discontinuous at p and call p a discontinuity
point of f . This is also the case if p ∈
/ A (since f (p) is not defined ).
If (1) holds for each p in a set B ⊆ A, we say that f is continuous on B. If
this is the case for B = A, we simply say that f is continuous.
1

Of course, for f (x) to exist, x must also be in A = Df ; thus x ∈ A ∩ Gp (δ). We say that
x is δ-close to p iff ρ(x, p) < δ.

150

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Sometimes we prefer to keep x near p but different from p. We then replace
Gp (δ) in (1) by the set Gp (δ) − {p}, i.e., the globe without its center , denoted
G¬p (δ) and called the deleted δ-globe about p. This is even necessary if p ∈
/ Df .
Replacing f (p) in (1) by some q ∈ T , we then are led to the following definition.
Definition 2.
Given f : A → (T, ρ′ ), A ⊆ (S, ρ), p ∈ S, and q ∈ T , we say that f (x)
tends to q as x tends to p (f (x) → q as x → p) iff for each ε > 0 there is
δ > 0 such that ρ′ (f (x), q) < ε for all x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ). In symbols,
 ′
ρ (f (x), q) < ε, i.e.,
(2)
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))
f (x) ∈ Gq (ε).

This means that f (x) is ε-close to q when x is δ-close to p and x 6= p.2
If (2) holds for some q, we call q a limit of f at p. There may be no such q.
We then say that f has no limit at p, or that this limit does not exist. If there
is only one such q (for a given p), we write q = lim f (x).
x→p

Note 1. Formula (2) holds “vacuously” (see Chapter 1, §§1–3, end remark)
if A ∩ G¬p (δ) = ∅ for some δ > 0. Then any q ∈ T is a limit at p, so a limit
exists but is not unique. (We discard the case where T is a singleton.)
Note 2. However, uniqueness is ensured if A ∩ G¬p (δ) 6= ∅ for all δ > 0, as
we prove below.
Observe that by Corollary 6 of Chapter 3, §14, the set A clusters at p iff
(∀ δ > 0) A ∩ G¬p (δ) 6= ∅. (Explain!)
Thus we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1. If A clusters at p in (S, ρ), then a function f : A → (T, p′ ) can
have at most one limit at p; i .e.,
lim f (x) is unique (if it exists).3

x→p

In particular , this holds if A ⊇ (a, b) ⊂ E 1 (a < b) and p ∈ [a, b].

Proof. Suppose f has two limits, q and r, at p. By the Hausdorff property,
Gq (ε) ∩ Gr (ε) = ∅

for some ε > 0.

Also, by (2), there are δ ′ , δ ′′ > 0 such that
(∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ ′ ))

(∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ ′′ ))
2

f (x) ∈ Gq (ε) and
f (x) ∈ Gr (ε).

Observe that the choice of δ depends on ε in both (1) and (2).
Because of this, some authors restrict Definition 2 to the case where A clusters at p.
However, this has its disadvantages (e.g., Corollary 2 fails).
3

151

§1. Basic Definitions

Let δ = min(δ ′ , δ ′′ ). Then for x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ), f (x) is in both Gq (ε) and Gr (ε),
and such an x exists since A ∩ G¬p (δ) 6= ∅ by assumption.
But this is impossible since Gq (ε) ∩ Gr (ε) = ∅ (a contradiction!). 
For intervals, see Chapter 3, §14, Example (h).

Corollary 2. f is continuous at p (p ∈ Df ) iff f (x) → f (p) as x → p.
The straightforward proof from definitions is left to the reader.

Note 3. In formula (2), we excluded the case x = p by assuming that
x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ). This makes the behavior of f at p itself irrelevant. Thus for
the existence of a limit q at p, it does not matter whether p ∈ Df or whether
f (p) = q. But both conditions are required for continuity at p (see Corollary 2
and Definition 1).
Note 4. Observe that if (1) or (2) holds for some δ, it certainly holds for
any δ ′ ≤ δ. Thus we may always choose δ as small as we like. Moreover, as
x is limited to Gp (δ), we may disregard, or change at will, the function values
f (x) for x ∈
/ Gp (δ) (“local character of the limit notion”).

II. Limits in E ∗ . If S or T is E ∗ (or E 1 ), we may let x → ±∞ or
f (x) → ±∞. For a precise definition, we rewrite (2) in terms of globes Gp and
Gq :
(∀ Gq ) (∃ Gp ) (∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p ) f (x) ∈ Gq .
(2′ )
This makes sense also if p = ±∞ or q = ±∞. We only have to use our
conventions as to G±∞ , or the metric ρ′ for E ∗ , as explained in Chapter 3, §11.
For example, consider
“f (x) → q as x → +∞” (A ⊆ S = E ∗ , p = +∞, q ∈ (T, ρ′ )).
Here Gp has the form (a, +∞], a ∈ E 1 , and G¬p = (a, +∞), while Gq = Gq (ε),
as usual. Noting that x ∈ G¬p means x > a (x ∈ E 1 ), we can rewrite (2′ ) as
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ a ∈ E 1 ) (∀ x ∈ A | x > a)

f (x) ∈ Gq (ε), or ρ′ (f (x), q) < ε. (3)

This means that f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to q for large x (x > a).
Next consider “f (x) → +∞ as x → −∞.” Here G¬p = (−∞, a) and
Gq = (b, +∞]. Thus formula (2′ ) yields (with S = T = E ∗ , and x varying over
E1)
(∀ b ∈ E 1 ) (∃ a ∈ E 1 ) (∀ x ∈ A | x < a) f (x) > b;
(4)
similarly in other cases, which we leave to the reader.
Note 5. In (3), we may take A = N (the naturals). Then f : N → (T, ρ′ )
is a sequence in T . Writing m for x, set um = f (m) and a = k ∈ N to obtain
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

um ∈ Gq (ε); i.e., ρ′ (um , q) < ε.

152

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

This coincides with our definition of the limit q of a sequence {um } (see
Chapter 3, §14). Thus limits of sequences are a special case of function limits.
Theorems on sequences can be obtained from those on functions f : A → (T, ρ′ )
by simply taking A = N and S = E ∗ as above.
Note 6. Formulas (3) and (4) make sense also if S = E 1 (respectively,
S = T = E 1 ) since they do not involve any mention of ±∞. We shall use such
formulas also for functions f : A → T , with A ⊆ S ⊆ E 1 or T ⊆ E 1 , as the
case may be.
III. Relative Limits and Continuity. Sometimes the desired result (1)
or (2) does not hold in full , but only with A replaced by a smaller set B ⊆ A.
Thus we may have
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ B ∩ G¬p (δ))

f (x) ∈ Gq (ε).

In this case, we call q a relative limit of f at p over B and write
“f (x) → q as x → p over B”
or
lim

x→p, x∈B

f (x) = q

(if q is unique);

B is called the path over which x tends to p. If, in addition, p ∈ Df and
q = f (p), we say that f is relatively continuous at p over B; then (1) holds
with A replaced by B. Again, if this holds for every p ∈ B, we say that f
is relatively continuous on B. Clearly, if B = A = Df , this yields ordinary
(nonrelative) limits and continuity. Thus relative limits and continuity are
more general .
Note that for limits over a path B, x is chosen from B or B − {p} only.
Thus the behavior of f outside B becomes irrelevant, and so we may arbitrarily
redefine f on −B. For example, if p ∈
/ B but limx→p, x∈B f (x) = q exists, we
may define f (p) = q, thus making f relatively continuous at p (over B). We
also may replace (S, ρ) by (B, ρ) (if p ∈ B), or restrict f to B, i.e., replace
f by the function g : B → (T, ρ′ ) defined by g(x) = f (x) for x ∈ B (briefly,
g = f on B).4
A particularly important case is
A ⊆ S ⊆ E ∗ , e.g., S = E 1 .
Then inequalities are defined in S, so we may take
B = {x ∈ A | x < p} (points in A, preceding p).
4

The function g is called the restriction of f to B denoted fB or f |B . Thus f is relatively
continuous on B iff fB is continuous.

153

§1. Basic Definitions

Then, writing Gq for Gq (ε) and a = p − δ, we obtain from formula (2)
(∀ Gq ) (∃ a < p) (∀ x ∈ A | a < x < p)

f (x) ∈ Gq .

(5)

If (5) holds, we call q a left limit of f at p and write
“f (x) → q as x → p− ” (“x tends to p from the left”).
If, in addition, q = f (p), we say that f is left continuous at p. Similarly, taking
B = {x ∈ A | x > p},
we obtain right limits and continuity. We write
f (x) → q as x → p+
iff q is a right limit of f at p, i.e., if (5) holds with all inequalities reversed.
If the set B in question clusters at p, the relative limit (if any) is unique.
We then denote the left and right limit, respectively, by f (p− ) and f (p+ ), and
we write
lim f (x) = f (p− ) and lim f (x) = f (p+ ).
(6)
x→p−

x→p+

Corollary 3. With the previous notation, if f (x) → q as x → p over a path
B, and also over D, then f (x) → q as x → p over B ∪ D.
Hence if Df ⊆ E ∗ and p ∈ E ∗ , we have
q = lim f (x) iff q = f (p− ) = f (p+ ).
x→p

(Exercise!)

We now illustrate our definitions by a diagram in E 2 representing a function
f : E 1 → E 1 by its graph, i.e., points (x, y) such that y = f (x).
Here
Gq (ε) = (q − ε, q + ε)
is an interval on the y-axis. The dotted lines show how to construct an interval
(p − δ, p + δ) = Gp
on the x-axis, satisfying formula (1) in Figure 13, formulas (5) and (6) in
Figure 14, or formula (2) in Figure 15. The point Q in each diagram belongs
to the graph; i.e., Q = (p, f (p)). In Figure 13, f is continuous at p (and also at
p1 ). However, it is only left-continuous at p in Figure 14, and it is discontinuous
at p in Figure 15, though f (p− ) and f (p+ ) exist. (Why?)
Examples.
(a) Let f : A → T be constant on B ⊆ A; i.e.,
f (x) = q for a fixed q ∈ T and all x ∈ B.

Then, given ε > 0, take δ = ε to obtain, for p ∈ A,
(∀ x ∈ A ∩ Gp (δ))

ρ(f (x), f (p)) = ρ(x, p) < δ = ε.

Thus by (1), f is continuous at any p ∈ A, hence on A.

(c) Define f : E 1 → E 1 by

f (x) = 1 if x is rational, and f (x) = 0 otherwise.
(This is the Dirichlet function, so named after Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.)
No matter how small δ is, the globe
Gp (δ) = (p − δ, p + δ)
(even the deleted globe) contains both rationals and irrationals. Thus as
x varies over G¬p (δ), f (x) takes on both values, 0 and 1, many times and
so gets out of any Gq (ε), with q ∈ E 1 , ε < 21 .
Hence for any q, p ∈ E 1 , formula (2) fails if we take ε = 41 , say. Thus
f has no limit at any p ∈ E 1 and hence is discontinuous everywhere!
However, f is relatively continuous on the set R of all rationals by Example (a).
(d) Define f : E 1 → E 1 by
f (x) = [x] (= the integral part of x; see Chapter 2, §10).
Thus f (x) = 0 for x ∈ [0, 1), f (x) = 1 for x ∈ [1, 2), etc. Then f is
discontinuous at p if p is an integer (why?) but continuous at any other
p (restrict f to a small Gp (δ) so as to make it constant).

Let B be any line in E 2 through 0̄, given parametrically by
x̄ = t~u,

t ∈ E 1 , ~u fixed (see Chapter 3, §§4–6),

so x1 = tu1 and x2 = tu2 . As is easily seen, for x̄ ∈ B, f (x̄) = f (ū)
(constant) if x̄ 6= 0̄. Hence
(∀ x̄ ∈ B ∩ G¬0̄ (δ))

f (x̄) = f (ū),

i.e., ρ(f (x̄), f (ū)) = 0 < ε, for any ε > 0 and any deleted globe about 0̄.
By (2′ ), then, f (x̄) → f (ū) as x̄ → 0̄ over the path B. Thus f has a
relative limit f (ū) at 0̄, over any line x̄ = tū, but this limit is different
for various choices of ū, i.e., for different lines through 0̄. No ordinary
limit at 0̄ exists (why?); f is not even relatively continuous at 0̄ over the
line x̄ = t~u unless f (ū) = 0 (which is the case only if the line is one of
the coordinate axes (why?)).

Problems on Limits and Continuity
1. Prove Corollary 2. Why can one interchange Gp (δ) and G¬p (δ) here?
2. Prove Corollary 3. By induction, extend its first clause to unions of n
paths. Disprove it for infinite unions of paths (see Problem 9 in §3).

2′ . Prove that a function f : E 1 → (T, ρ′ ) is continuous at p iff
f (p) = f (p− ) = f (p+ ).

3. Show that relative limits and continuity at p (over B) are equivalent
to the ordinary ones if B is a neighborhood of p (Chapter 3, §12); for
example, if it is some Gp .
4. Discuss Figures 13–15 in detail, comparing f (p), f (p− ), and f (p+ ); see
Problem 2′ .
Observe that in Figure 13, different values of δ result at p and p1 for
the same ε. Thus δ depends on both ε and the choice of p.

§2. Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity

§2. Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity
I. In §1 we gave the so-called “ε, δ” definition of continuity. Now we present
another (equivalent) formulation, known as the sequential one. Roughly, it
states that f is continuous iff it carries convergent sequences {xm } ⊆ Df into
convergent “image sequences” {f (xm )}. More precisely, we have the following
theorem.
Theorem 1 (sequential criterion of continuity). (i) A function
f : A → (T, ρ′ ), with A ⊆ (S, ρ),
is continuous at a point p ∈ A iff for every sequence {xm } ⊆ A such that
xm → p in (S, ρ), we have f (xm ) → f (p) in (T, ρ′ ). In symbols,
(∀ {xm } ⊆ A | xm → p)

f (xm ) → f (p).

(1′ )

(ii) Similarly, a point q ∈ T is a limit of f at p (p ∈ S) iff
(∀ {xm } ⊆ A − {p} | xm → p)

f (xm ) → q.

(2′ )

Note that in (2′ ) we consider only sequences of terms other than p.
Proof. We first prove (ii). Suppose q is a limit of f at p, i.e. (see §1),
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))

f (x) ∈ Gq (ε).

(2)

Thus, given ε > 0, there is δ > 0 (henceforth fixed) such that
f (x) ∈ Gq (ε) whenever x ∈ A, x 6= p, and x ∈ Gp (δ).

(3)

We want to deduce (2′ ). Thus we fix any sequence
{xm } ⊆ A − {p}, xm → p.1
Then
(∀ m)

xm ∈ A and xm 6= p,

and Gp (δ) contains all but finitely many xm . Then these xm satisfy the conditions stated in (3). Hence f (xm ) ∈ Gq (ε) for all but finitely many m. As ε
is arbitrary, this implies f (xm ) → q (by the definition of lim f (xm )), as is
m→∞
required in (2′ ). Thus (2) =⇒ (2′ ).
Conversely, suppose (2) fails, i.e., its negation holds. (See the rules for
forming negations of such formulas in Chapter 1, §§1–3.) Thus
(∃ ε > 0) (∀ δ > 0) (∃ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))
1

f (x) ∈
/ Gq (ε)

If no such sequence exists, then (2′ ) is vacuously true and there is nothing to prove.

(4)

162

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

by the rules for quantifiers. We fix an ε satisfying (4), and let
1

there is xm (depending on δm ) such that
1
xm ∈ A ∩ G¬p

δm =

By (4), for each δm

and

f (xm ) ∈
/ Gq (ε),

m = 1, 2, 3, . . .

(5)
(6)

We fix these xm . As xm ∈ A and xm 6= p, we obtain a sequence
{xm } ⊆ A − {p}.

1
Also, as xm ∈ Gp ( m
), we have ρ(xm , p) < 1/m → 0, and hence xm → p.
On the other hand, by (6), the image sequence {f (xm )} cannot converge to q
(why?), i.e., (2′ ) fails. Thus we see that (2′ ) fails or holds accordingly as (2)
does.
This proves assertion (ii). Now, by setting q = f (p) in (2) and (2′ ), we also
obtain the first clause of the theorem, as to continuity. 

Note 1. The theorem also applies to relative limits and continuity over a
path B (just replace A by B in the proof), as well as to the cases p = ±∞
and q = ±∞ in E ∗ (for E ∗ can be treated as a metric space; see the end of
Chapter 3, §11).
If the range space (T, ρ′ ) is complete (Chapter 3, §17), then the image
sequences {f (xm )} converge iff they are Cauchy. This leads to the following
corollary.
Corollary 1. Let (T, ρ′ ) be complete, such as E n . Let a map f : A → T with
A ⊆ (S, ρ) and a point p ∈ S be given. Then for f to have a limit at p,
it suffices that {f (xm )} be Cauchy in (T, ρ′ ) whenever {xm } ⊆ A − {p} and
xm → p in (S, ρ).
Indeed, as noted above, all such {f (xm )} converge. Thus it only remains to
show that they tend to one and the same limit q, as is required in part (ii) of
Theorem 1. We leave this as an exercise (Problem 1 below).
∗

Theorem 2 (Cauchy criterion for functions). With the assumptions of Corollary 1, the function f has a limit at p iff for each ε > 0, there is δ > 0 such
that
ρ′ (f (x), f (x′ )) < ε for all x, x′ ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ).2
In symbols,
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x, x′ ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))
2

ρ′ (f (x), f (x′ )) < ε.

That is, f (x) is ε-close to f (x′ ) when x and x′ are δ-close to p, but not equal to p.

(7)

163

§2. Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity

Proof. Assume (7). To show that f has a limit at p, we use Corollary 1. Thus
we take any sequence
{xm } ⊆ A − {p} with xm → p
and show that {f (xm )} is Cauchy, i.e.,

(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m, n > k) ρ′ (f (xm ), f (xn )) < ε.

To do this, fix an arbitrary ε > 0. By (7), we have
(∀ x, x′ ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))

ρ′ (f (x), f (x′ )) < ε,

(7′ )

for some δ > 0. Now as xm → p, there is k such that
(∀ m, n > k)

xm , xn ∈ Gp (δ).

As {xm } ⊆ A − {p}, we even have xm , xn ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ). Hence by (7′ ),
(∀ m, n > k)

ρ′ (f (xm ), f (xn )) < ε;

i.e., {f (xm )} is Cauchy, as required in Corollary 1, and so f has a limit at p.
This shows that (7) implies the existence of that limit.
The easy converse proof is left to the reader. (See Problem 2.) 
II. Composite Functions. The composite of two functions
f : S → T and g : T → U ,
denoted
g◦f

(in that order),

is by definition a map of S into U given by
(g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)),

x ∈ S.

Our next theorem states, roughly, that g ◦ f is continuous if g and f are. We
shall use Theorem 1 to prove it.
Theorem 3. Let (S, ρ), (T, ρ′ ), and (U, ρ′′ ) be metric spaces. If a function
f : S → T is continuous at a point p ∈ S, and if g : T → U is continuous at the
point q = f (p), then the composite function g ◦ f is continuous at p.
Proof. The domain of g ◦ f is S. So take any sequence
{xm } ⊆ S with xm → p.

As f is continuous at p, formula (1′ ) yields f (xm ) → f (p), where f (xm ) is in
T = Dg . Hence, as g is continuous at f (p), we have
g(f (xm )) → g(f (p)), i.e., (g ◦ f )(xm ) → (g ◦ f )(p),
and this holds for any {xm } ⊆ S with xm → p. Thus g ◦ f satisfies condition
(1′ ) and is continuous at p. 

164

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Caution: The fact that
lim f (x) = q and lim g(y) = r

x→p

y→q

does not imply
lim g(f (x)) = r

x→p

(see Problem 3 for counterexamples).
Indeed, if {xm } ⊆ S −{p} and xm → p, we obtain, as before, f (xm ) → q, but
not f (xm ) 6= q. Thus we cannot re-apply formula (2′ ) to obtain g(f (xm )) → r
since (2′ ) requires that f (xm ) 6= q. The argument still works if g is continuous
at q (then (1′ ) applies) or if f (x) never equals q (then f (xm ) 6= q). It even
suffices that f (x) 6= q for x in some deleted globe about p (see §1, Note 4).
Hence we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2. With the notation of Theorem 3, suppose
f (x) → q as x → p, and g(y) → r as y → q.
Then
g(f (x)) → r as x → p,
provided, however, that
(i) g is continuous at q, or
(ii) f (x) 6= q for x in some deleted globe about p, or
(iii) f is one to one, at least when restricted to some G¬p (δ).
Indeed, (i) and (ii) suffice, as was explained above. Thus assume (iii). Then
f can take the value q at most once, say, at some point
x0 ∈ G¬p (δ).
As x0 6= p, let

δ ′ = ρ(x0 , p) > 0.

Then x0 ∈
/ G¬p (δ ′ ), so f (x) 6= q on G¬p (δ ′ ), and case (iii) reduces to (ii).
We now show how to apply Corollary 2.
Note 2. Suppose we know that
r = lim g(y) exists.
y→q

Using this fact, we often pass to another variable x, setting y = f (x) where f
is such that q = limx→p f (x) for some p. We shall say that the substitution (or

165

§2. Some General Theorems on Limits and Continuity

“change of variable”) y = f (x) is admissible if one of the conditions (i), (ii), or
(iii) of Corollary 2 holds.3 Then by Corollary 2,
lim g(y) = r = lim g(f (x))

(yielding the second limit).

In particular, the so-called linear substitution y = ax + b (a, b ∈ E 1 , a 6= 0) is always
admissible since f (x) = ax + b yields a one-to-one map.

166

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

(C) In Examples (A) and (B), we now substitute x = 1/z. This is admissible
by Corollary 2(ii) since the dependence between x and z is one to one.
Then
z=

Thus (A) and (B) yield

By Chapter 3, §14, Corollary 4, p is also the limit of
x1 , x′1 , x2 , x′2 , . . . ,
so, by assumption,
f (x1 ), f (x′1 ), . . . converges (to q, say).
Hence {f (xm )} and {f (x′m )} must have the same limit q. (Why?)]

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

§3. Operations on Limits. Rational Functions
I. A function f : A → T is said to be real if its range Df′ lies in E 1 , complex
if Df′ ⊆ C, vector valued if Df′ is a subset of E n , and scalar valued if Df′ lies in
the scalar field of E n . (∗ In the latter two cases, we use the same terminology if
E n is replaced by some other (fixed) normed space under consideration.) The
domain A may be arbitrary.
For such functions one can define various operations whenever they are defined for elements of their ranges, to which the function values f (x) belong.
Thus as in Chapter 3, §9, we define the functions f ±g, f g, and f /g “pointwise,”
setting
f 
f (x)
(x) =
(f ± g)(x) = f (x) ± g(x), (f g)(x) = f (x) g(x), and
g
g(x)
whenever the right side expressions are defined. We also define |f | : A → E 1
by
(∀ x ∈ A) |f |(x) = |f (x)|.

In particular, f ±g is defined if f and g are both vector valued or both scalar
valued, and f g is defined if f is vector valued while g is scalar valued; similarly
for f /g. (However, the domain of f /g consists of those x ∈ A only for which
g(x) 6= 0.)
In the theorems below, all limits are at some (arbitrary, but fixed) point p
of the domain space (S, ρ). For brevity, we often omit “x → p.”
Theorem 1. For any functions f, g, h : A → E 1 (C), A ⊆ (S, ρ), we have the
following:
(i) If f, g, h are continuous at p (p ∈ A), so are f ± g and f h. So also is
f /h, provided h(p) 6= 0; similarly for relative continuity over B ⊆ A.

(ii) If f (x) → q, g(x) → r, and h(x) → a (all , as x → p over B ⊆ A), then
(a) f (x) ± g(x) → q ± r;

(b) f (x)h(x) → qa; and
(c)

f (x)
q
→ , provided a 6= 0.
h(x)
a

All this holds also if f and g are vector valued and h is scalar valued .
For a simple proof, one can use Theorem 1 of Chapter 3, §15. (An independent proof is sketched in Problems 1–7 below.)
We can also use the sequential criterion (Theorem 1 in §2). To prove (ii),
take any sequence
{xm } ⊆ B − {p}, xm → p.

171

§3. Operations on Limits. Rational Functions

Then by the assumptions made,
f (xm ) → q, g(xm ) → r, and h(xm ) → a.
Thus by Theorem 1 of Chapter 3, §15,
f (xm ) ± g(xm ) → q ± r, f (xm )g(xm ) → qa, and

q
f (xm )
→ .
g(xm )
a

As this holds for any sequence {xm } ⊆ B − {p} with xm → p, our assertion
(ii) follows by the sequential criterion; similarly for (i).
Note 1. By induction, the theorem also holds for sums and products of any
finite number of functions (whenever such products are defined).
Note 2. Part (ii) does not apply to infinite limits q, r, a; but it does apply
to limits at p = ±∞ (take E ∗ with a suitable metric for the space S).

Note 3. The assumption h(x) → a 6= 0 (as x → p over B) implies that
h(x) 6= 0 for x in B ∩ G¬p (δ) for some δ > 0; see Problem 5 below. Thus the
quotient function f /h is defined on B ∩ G¬p (δ) at least.

II. If the range space of f is E n (∗ or C n ), then each function value f (x) is
a vector in that space; thus it has n real (∗ respectively, complex) components,
denoted
fk (x), k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Here we may treat fk as a mapping of A = Df into E 1 (∗ or C); it carries
each point x ∈ A into fk (x), the kth component of f (x). In this manner, each
function
f : A → E n (∗ C n )
uniquely determines n scalar-valued maps
fk : A → E 1 (C),
called the components of f . Notation: f = (f1 , . . . , fn ).
Conversely, given n arbitrary functions
fk : A → E 1 (C),

k = 1, 2, . . . , n,

one can define f : A → E n (∗ C n ) by setting
f (x) = (f1 (x), f2 (x), . . . , fn (x)).
Then obviously f = (f1 , f2 , . . . , fn ). Thus the fk in turn determine f uniquely.
To define a function f : A → E n (∗ C n ) means to give its n components fk . Note
that

172

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

where the ēk are the n basic unit vectors; see Chapter 3, §§1–3, Theorem 2.
Our next theorem shows that the limits and continuity of f reduce to those of
the fk .
Theorem 2 (componentwise continuity and limits). For any function f : A →
E n (∗ C n ), with A ⊆ (S, ρ) and with f = (f1 , . . . , fn ), we have that
(i) f is continuous at p (p ∈ A) iff all its components fk are, and

(ii) f (x) → q̄ as x → p (p ∈ S) iff
fk (x) → qk as x → p

(k = 1, 2, . . . , n),

i .e., iff each fk has, as its limit at p, the corresponding component of q̄.
Similar results hold for relative continuity and limits over a path B ⊆ A.
We prove (ii). If f (x) → q̄ as x → p then, by definition,
s

(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))

ε > |f (x) − q̄| =

n
X

k=1

|fk (x) − qk |2 ;

in turn, the right-hand side of the inequality given above is no less than each
|fk (x) − qk |,

k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

Thus
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))

|fk (x) − qk | < ε;

i.e., fk (x) → qk , k = 1, . . . , n.
Conversely, if each fk (x) → qk , then Theorem 1(ii) yields
n
X

k=1

ēk fk (x) →

n
X

ēk qk .1

k=1

Pn

By formula (1), then, f (x) → q̄ (for
k=1 ēk qk = q̄). Thus (ii) is proved;
similarly for (i) and for relative limits and continuity.
Note 4. Again, Theorem 2 holds also for p = ±∞ (but not for infinite q).

Note 5. A complex function f : A → C may be treated as f : A → E 2 .
Thus it has two real components: f = (f1 , f2 ). Traditionally, f1 and f2 are
called the real and imaginary parts of f , also denoted by fre and fim , so
f = fre + i · fim .
By Theorem 2, f is continuous at p iff fre and fim are.
1

Here we treat ēk as a constant function, with values ēk (cf. §1, Example (a)).

173

§3. Operations on Limits. Rational Functions

Example.
The complex exponential is the function f : E 1 → C defined by
f (x) = cos x + i · sin x, also written f (x) = exi .

As we shall see later, the sine and the cosine functions are continuous.
Hence so is f by Theorem 2.
III. Next, consider functions whose domain is a set in E n (∗ or C n ). We call
them functions of n real (∗ or complex ) variables, treating x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ) as
a variable n-tuple. The range space may be arbitrary.
In particular, a monomial in n variables is a map on E n (∗ or C n ) given by
a formula of the form
n
Y
mn
1 m2
k
f (x̄) = axm
x
·
·
·
x
=
a
·
xm
n
1
2
k ,
k=1

where theP
mk are fixed integers ≥ 0 and a ∈ E 1 (∗ or a ∈ C).2 If a 6= 0, the
n
sum m = k=1 mk is called the degree of the monomial. Thus
f (x, y, z) = 3x2 yz 3 = 3x2 y 1 z 3

defines a monomial of degree 6, in three real (or complex) variables x, y, z.
(We often write x, y, z for x1 , x2 , x3 .)
A polynomial is any sum of a finite number of monomials; its degree is, by
definition, that of its leading term, i.e., the one of highest degree. (There may
be several such terms, of equal degree.) For example,
f (x, y, z) = 3x2 yz 3 − 2xy 7
defines a polynomial of degree 8 in x, y, z. Polynomials of degree 1 are sometimes called linear .
A rational function is the quotient f /g of two polynomials f and g on E n
∗
( or C n ).3 Its domain consists of those points at which g does not vanish. For
example,
x2 − 3xy
h(x, y) =
xy − 1
defines a rational function on points (x, y), with xy 6= 1. Polynomials and
monomials are rational functions with denominator 1.
Theorem 3. Any rational function (in particular , every polynomial ) in one
or several variables is continuous on all of its domain.
2

We also allow a to be a vector , while the xk are scalars.
This is valid also if one allows the coefficients of f to be vectors (provided those of g,
and the variables xk , remain scalars).
3

174

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Proof. Consider first a monomial of the form
f (x̄) = xk

(k fixed);

it is called the kth projection map because it “projects” each x̄ ∈ E n (∗ C n )
onto its kth component xk .
Given any ε > 0 and p̄, choose δ = ε. Then
s n
X
|xi − pi |2 = ρ(x̄, p̄) < ε.
(∀ x̄ ∈ Gp̄ (δ)) |f (x̄) − f (p̄)| = |xk − pk | ≤
i=1

Hence by definition, f is continuous at each p̄. Thus the theorem holds for
projection maps.
However, any other monomial, given by
mn
1 m2
f (x̄) = axm
1 x2 · · · xn ,

is the product of finitely many (namely of m = m1 + m2 + · · · + mn ) projection
maps multiplied by a constant a. Thus by Theorem 1, it is continuous. So
also is any finite sum of monomials (i.e., any polynomial), and hence so is
the quotient f /g of two polynomials (i.e., any rational function) wherever it is
defined, i.e., wherever the denominator does not vanish. 
IV. For functions on E n (∗ or C n ), we often consider relative limits over a
line of the form
x̄ = p̄ + t~ek (parallel to the kth axis, through p̄);
see Chapter 3, §§4–6, Definition 1. If f is relatively continuous at p̄ over that
line, we say that f is continuous at p̄ in the kth variable xk (because the other
components of x̄ remain constant, namely, equal to those of p̄, as x̄ runs over
that line). As opposed to this, we say that f is continuous at p̄ in all n variables
jointly if it is continuous at p̄ in the ordinary (not relative) sense. Similarly,
we speak of limits in one variable, or in all of them jointly.
Since ordinary continuity implies relative continuity over any path, joint
continuity in all n variables always implies that in each variable separately,
but the converse fails (see Problems 9 and 10 below); similarly for limits at p̄.

In Problems 2, 3, and 4, E = E n (∗ or another normed space), F is its scalar
field, B ⊆ A ⊆ (S, ρ), and x → p over B.
2. For a function f : A → E prove that
f (x) → q ⇐⇒ |f (x) − q| → 0,
equivalently, iff f (x) − q → 0̄.

[Hint: Proceed as in Chapter 3, §14, Corollary 2.]

3. Given f : A → (T, ρ′ ), with f (x) → q as x → p over B. Show that for

f [B ∩ G¬p (δ)] is a bounded set in (T, ρ′ ).

Thus if T = E, there is K ∈ E 1 such that
(∀ x ∈ B ∩ G¬p (δ))

177

§4. Infinite Limits. Operations in E ∗
As we have noted, Theorem 1 of §3 does not apply to infinite limits,1 even if
the function values f (x), g(x), h(x) remain finite (i.e., in E 1 ). Only in certain
cases (stated below) can we prove some analogues.
There are quite a few such separate cases. Thus, for brevity, we shall adopt
a kind of mathematical shorthand. The letter q will not necessarily denote a
constant; it will stand for
“a function f : A → E 1 , A ⊆ (S, ρ), such that f (x) → q ∈ E 1 as x → p.”2
Similarly, “0” and “±∞” will stand for analogous expressions, with q replaced
by 0 and ±∞, respectively.
For example, the “shorthand formula” (+∞) + (+∞) = +∞ means
“The sum of two real functions, with limit +∞ at p (p ∈ S), is itself a
function with limit +∞ at p.”3
The point p is fixed, possibly ±∞ (if A ⊆ E ∗ ). With this notation, we have
the following theorems.
Theorems.
1. (±∞) + (±∞) = ±∞.

2. (±∞) + q = q + (±∞) = ±∞.
3. (±∞) · (±∞) = +∞.

4. (±∞) · (∓∞) = −∞.

5. | ± ∞| = +∞.

6. (±∞) · q = q · (±∞) = ±∞ if q > 0.

7. (±∞) · q = q · (±∞) = ∓∞ if q < 0.

It even has no meaning since operations on ±∞ have not been defined.
Note that q is finite throughout.
3 Similarly for (−∞) + (−∞) = −∞. Both combined are written as “(±∞) + (±∞) =
±∞.”

14. (+∞)q = 0 if q < 0.
15. If q > 1, then q +∞ = +∞ and q −∞ = 0.
16. If 0 < q < 1, then q +∞ = 0 and q −∞ = +∞.
We prove Theorems 1 and 2, leaving the rest as problems. (Theorems 11–16
are best postponed until the theory of logarithms is developed.)
1. Let f (x) and g(x) → +∞ as x → p. We have to show that
f (x) + g(x) → +∞,
i.e., that
(∀ b ∈ E 1 ) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ)) f (x) + g(x) > b
(we may assume b > 0). Thus fix b > 0. As f (x) and g(x) → +∞, there
are δ ′ , δ ′′ > 0 such that
(∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ ′ )) f (x) > b and (∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ ′′ )) g(x) > b.
Let δ = min(δ ′ , δ ′′ ). Then
(∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))

f (x) + g(x) > b + b > b,

as required; similarly for the case of −∞.

2. Let f (x) → +∞ and g(x) → q ∈ E 1 . Then there is δ ′ > 0 such that for
x in A ∩ G¬p (δ ′ ), |q − g(x)| < 1, so that g(x) > q − 1.
Also, given any b ∈ E 1 , there is δ ′′ such that
(∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ ′′ ))

f (x) > b − q + 1.

Let δ = min(δ ′ , δ ′′ ). Then
(∀ x ∈ A ∩ G¬p (δ))

f (x) + g(x) > (b − q + 1) + (q − 1) = b,

as required; similarly for the case of f (x) → −∞.

In these cases, it does not suffice to know only the limits of f and g. It
is necessary to investigate the functions themselves to give a definite answer,
since in each case the answer may be different, depending on the properties of
f and g. The expressions (1∗ ) remain indeterminate even if we consider the
simplest kind of functions, namely sequences, as we show next.

Examples.
(a) Let
um = 2m and vm = −m.
(This corresponds to f (x) = 2x and g(x) = −x.) Then, as is readily seen,
um → +∞, vm → −∞, and um + vm = 2m − m = m → +∞.
If, however, we take xm = 2m and ym = −2m, then
xm + ym = 2m − 2m = 0;
thus xm +ym is constant, with limit 0 (for the limit of a constant function
equals its value; see §1, Example (a)).
Next, let
um = 2m and zm = −2m + (−1)m .
Then again
um → +∞ and zm → −∞, but um + zm = (−1)m ;
um + zm “oscillates” from −1 to 1 as m → +∞, so it has no limit at all.
These examples show that (+∞) + (−∞) is indeed an indeterminate
expression since the answer depends on the nature of the functions involved. No general answer is possible.
(b) We now show that 1+∞ is indeterminate.
Take first a constant {xm }, xm = 1, and let ym = m. Then
xm → 1, ym → +∞, and xymm = 1m = 1 = xm → 1.

1
If, however, xm = 1 + m
and ym = m, then again ym → +∞ and xm → 1
(by Theorem 10 above and Theorem 1 of Chapter 3, §15), but

1 m
xymm = 1 +
m
does not tend to 1; it tends to e > 2, as shown in Chapter 3, §15. Thus
again the result depends on {xm } and {ym }.

In a similar manner, one shows that the other cases (1∗ ) are indeterminate.
Note 1. It is often useful to introduce additional “shorthand” conventions.
Thus the symbol ∞ (unsigned infinity) might denote a function f such that
|f (x)| → +∞ as x → p;
we then also write f (x) → ∞. The symbol 0+ (respectively, 0− ) denotes a
function f such that
f (x) → 0 as x → p

Note 2. All these formulas and theorems hold for relative limits, too.
So far, we have defined no arithmetic operations in E ∗ . To fill this gap
(at least partially), we shall henceforth treat Theorems 1–16 above not only as
certain limit statements (in “shorthand ”) but also as definitions of certain operations in E ∗ . For example, the formula (+∞) + (+∞) = +∞ shall be treated
as the definition of the actual sum of +∞ and +∞ in E ∗ , with +∞ regarded
this time as an element of E ∗ (not as a function). This convention defines the
arithmetic operations for certain cases only; the indeterminate expressions (1∗ )
remain undefined, unless we decide to assign them some meaning.
In higher analysis, it indeed proves convenient to assign a meaning to at
least some of them. We shall adopt these (admittedly arbitrary) conventions:

(±∞) + (∓∞) = (±∞) − (±∞) = +∞; 00 = 1;
(2∗ )
0 · (±∞) = (±∞) · 0 = 0 (even if 0 stands for the zero-vector ).
Caution: These formulas must not be treated as limit theorems (in “shorthand”). Sums and products of the form (2∗ ) will be called “unorthodox .”

z = −1.

§5. Monotone Functions
A function f : A → E ∗ , with A ⊆ E ∗ , is said to be nondecreasing on a set
B ⊆ A iff
x ≤ y implies f (x) ≤ f (y) for x, y ∈ B.
It is said to be nonincreasing on B iff
x ≤ y implies f (x) ≥ f (y) for x, y ∈ B.
Notation: f ↑ and f ↓ (on B), respectively.

182

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

In both cases, f is said to be monotone or monotonic on B. If f is also one
to one on B (i.e., when restricted to B), we say that it is strictly monotone
(increasing if f ↑ and decreasing if f ↓).
Clearly, f is nondecreasing iff the function −f = (−1)f is nonincreasing.
Thus in proofs, we need consider only the case f ↑. The case f ↓ reduces to it
by applying the result to −f .
Theorem 1. If a function f : A → E ∗ (A ⊆ E ∗ ) is monotone on A, it has a
left and a right (possibly infinite) limit at each point p ∈ E ∗ .
In particular , if f ↑ on an interval (a, b) 6= ∅, then
f (p− ) = sup f (x) for p ∈ (a, b]
a<x<p

and
f (p+ ) = inf f (x) for p ∈ [a, b).
p<x<b

(In case f ↓, interchange “sup” and “inf.”)

Proof. To fix ideas, assume f ↑.
Let p ∈ E ∗ and B = {x ∈ A | x < p}. Put q = sup f [B] (this sup always
exists in E ∗ ; see Chapter 2, §13). We shall show that q is a left limit of f at p
(i.e., a left limit over B).
There are three possible cases:
(1) If q is finite, any globe Gq is an interval (c, d), c < q < d, in E 1 . As
c < q = sup f [B], c cannot be an upper bound of f [B] (why?), so c is
exceeded by some f (x0 ), x0 ∈ B. Thus
c < f (x0 ), x0 < p.
Hence as f ↑, we certainly have
c < f (x0 ) ≤ f (x) for all x > x0 (x ∈ B).
Moreover, as f (x) ∈ f [B], we have
f (x) ≤ sup f [B] = q < d,
so c < f (x) < d; i.e., f (x) ∈ (c, d) = Gq .
We have thus shown that
(∀ Gq ) (∃ x0 < p) (∀ x ∈ B | x0 < x) f (x) ∈ Gq ,
so q is a left limit at p.
(2) If q = +∞, the same proof works with Gq = (c, +∞]. Verify!
(3) If q = −∞, then
(∀ x ∈ B)

f (x) ≤ sup f [B] = −∞,

183

§5. Monotone Functions

i.e., f (x) ≤ −∞, so f (x) = −∞ (constant) on B. Hence q is also a left
limit at p (§1, Example (a)).
In particular, if f ↑ on A = (a, b) with a, b ∈ E ∗ and a < b, then B =
(a, p) for p ∈ (a, b]. Here p is a cluster point of the path B (Chapter 3, §14,
Example (h)), so a unique left limit f (p− ) exists. By what was shown above,
q = f (p− ) = sup f [B] = sup f (x), as claimed.
a<x<p

Thus all is proved for left limits.
The proof for right limits is quite similar; one only has to set
B = {x ∈ A | x > p}, q = inf f [B].



Note 1. The second clause of Theorem 1 holds even if (a, b) is only a
subset of A, for the limits in question are not affected by restricting f to (a, b).
(Why?) The endpoints a and b may be finite or infinite.
Note 2. If Df = A = N (the naturals), then by definition, f : N → E ∗ is a
sequence with general term xm = f (m), m ∈ N (see §1, Note 2). Then setting
p = +∞ in the proof of Theorem 1, we obtain Theorem 3 of Chapter 3, §15.
(Verify!)
Example.
The exponential function F : E 1 → E 1 to the base a > 0 is given by
F (x) = ax .

It is monotone (Chapter 2, §§11–12, formula (1)), so F (0− ) and F (0+ )
exist. By the sequential criterion (Theorem 1 of §2), we may use a suitable
1
sequence to find F (0+ ), and we choose xm = m
→ 0+ . Then

(see Chapter 3, §15, Problem 20).

→ 0− , we obtain F (0− ) = 1. Thus
Similarly, taking xm = − m
F (0+ ) = F (0− ) = lim F (x) = lim ax = 1.
x→0

x→0

(See also Problem 12 of §2.)
Next, fix any p ∈ E 1 . Noting that

F (x) = ax = ap+x−p = ap ax−p ,

we set y = x − p. (Why is this substitution admissible?) Then y → 0 as
x → p, so we get
lim F (x) = lim ap · lim ax−p = ap lim ay = ap · 1 = ap = F (p).

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

As limx→p F (x) = F (p), F is continuous at each p ∈ E 1 . Thus all
exponentials are continuous.
Theorem 2. If a function f : A → E ∗ (A ⊆ E ∗ ) is nondecreasing on a finite
or infinite interval B = (a, b) ⊆ A and if p ∈ (a, b), then
f (a+ ) ≤ f (p− ) ≤ f (p) ≤ f (p+ ) ≤ f (b− ),

(1)

and for no x ∈ (a, b) do we have

f (p− ) < f (x) < f (p) or f (p) < f (x) < f (p+ );1

similarly in case f ↓ (with all inequalities reversed ).
Proof. By Theorem 1, f ↑ on (a, p) implies

f (a+ ) = inf f (x) and f (p− ) = sup f (x);
a<x<p

a<x<p

thus certainly f (a+ ) ≤ f (p− ). As f ↑, we also have f (p) ≥ f (x) for all x ∈
(a, p); hence
f (p) ≥ sup f (x) = f (p− ).
a<x<p

Thus
f (a+ ) ≤ f (p− ) ≤ f (p);
similarly for the rest of (1).
Moreover, if a < x < p, then f (x) ≤ f (p− ) since
f (p− ) = sup f (x).
a<x<p

If, however, p ≤ x < b, then f (p) ≤ f (x) since f ↑. Thus we never have
f (p− ) < f (x) < f (p). Similarly, one excludes f (p) < f (x) < f (p+ ). This
completes the proof. 
Note 3. If f (p− ), f (p+ ), and f (p) exist (all finite), then
|f (p) − f (p− )| and |f (p+ ) − f (p)|
are called, respectively, the left and right jumps of f at p; their sum is the
(total ) jump at p. If f is monotone, the jump equals |f (p+ ) − f (p− )|.
For a graphical example, consider Figure 14 in §1. Here f (p) = f (p− ) (both
finite), so the left jump is 0. However, f (p+ ) > f (p), so the right jump is
greater than 0. Since
f (p) = f (p− ) = lim f (x),
x→p−

f is left continuous (but not right continuous) at p.
1

In other words, the interval [f (p− ), f (p+ )] contains no f (x) except f (p).

185

§5. Monotone Functions

Theorem 3. If f : A → E ∗ is monotone on a finite or infinite interval (a, b)
contained in A, then all its discontinuities in (a, b), if any, are “jumps,” that
is, points p at which f (p− ) and f (p+ ) exist, but f (p− ) 6= f (p) or f (p+ ) 6= f (p).2

Proof. By Theorem 1, f (p− ) and f (p+ ) exist at each p ∈ (a, b).
If, in addition, f (p− ) = f (p+ ) = f (p), then
lim f (x) = f (p)

x→p

by Corollary 3 of §1, so f is continuous at p. Thus discontinuities occur only
if f (p− ) 6= f (p) or f (p+ ) 6= f (p). 

Problems on Monotone Functions
1. Complete the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2. Give also an independent
(analogous) proof for nonincreasing functions.
2. Discuss Examples (d) and (e) of §1 again using Theorems 1–3.
3. Show that Theorem 3 holds also if f is piecewise monotone on (a, b),
i.e., monotone on each of a sequence of intervals whose union is (a, b).
4. Consider the monotone function f defined in Problems 5 and 6 of Chapter 3, §11. Show that under the standard metric in E 1 , f is continuous
on E 1 and f −1 is continuous on (0, 1). Additionally, discuss continuity
under the metric ρ′ .
⇒5. Prove that if f is monotone on (a, b) ⊆ E ∗ , it has at most countably
many discontinuities in (a, b).
[Hint: Let f ↑. By Theorem 3, all discontinuities of f correspond to mutually disjoint
intervals (f (p− ), f (p+ )) 6= ∅. (Why?) Pick a rational from each such interval, so
these rationals correspond one to one to the discontinuities and form a countable set
(Chapter 1, §9)].

7. Restate Theorem 3 for the case where f is monotone on A, where A is
a (not necessarily open) interval. How about the endpoints of A?

§6. Compact Sets
We now pause to consider a very important kind of sets. In Chapter 3, §16,
we showed that every sequence {z̄m } taken from a closed interval [ā, b̄] in E n
must cluster in it (Note 1 of Chapter 3, §16).1 There are other sets with the
same remarkable property. This leads us to the following definition.
Definition 1.
A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is said to be sequentially compact (briefly compact) iff
every sequence {xm } ⊆ A clusters at some point p in A.
If all of S is compact, we say that the metric space (S, ρ) is compact.2
Examples.
(a) Each closed interval in E n is compact (see above).
(a′ ) However, nonclosed intervals, and E n itself, are not compact.
For example, the sequence xn = 1/n is in (0, 1] ⊂ E 1 , but clusters
only at 0, outside (0, 1]. As another example, the sequence xn = n has
no cluster points in E 1 . Thus (0, 1] and E 1 fail to be compact (even
though E 1 is complete); similarly for E n (∗ and C n ).
(b) Any finite set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is compact. Indeed, an infinite sequence in such
a set must have at least one infinitely repeating term p ∈ A. Then by
definition, this p is a cluster point (see Chapter 3, §14, Note 1).
(c) The empty set is “vacuously” compact (it contains no sequences).

(d) E ∗ is compact. See Example (g) in Chapter 3, §14.
Other examples can be derived from the theorems that follow.
1

Think of [ā, b̄] as of a container so “compact” that it “squeezes” into clustering any
sequence that is inside it, and it supplies the cluster point.
2 Hence A is compact iff (A, ρ) is compact as a subspace of (S, ρ). Note that {x } clusters
m
at p iff there is a subsequence xmk → p (Chapter 3, §16, Theorem 1).

§6. Compact Sets

187

Theorem 1. If a set B ⊆ (S, ρ) is compact, so is any closed subset A ⊆ B.

Proof. We must show that each sequence {xm } ⊆ A clusters at some p ∈ A.
However, as A ⊆ B, {xm } is also in B, so by the compactness of B, it clusters
at some p ∈ B. Thus it remains to show that p ∈ A as well.
Now by Theorem 1 of Chapter 3, §16, {xm } has a subsequence xmk → p.
As {xmk } ⊆ A and A is closed , this implies p ∈ A (Theorem 4 in Chapter 3,
§16). 
Theorem 2. Every compact set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is closed .

Proof. Given that A is compact, we must show (by Theorem 4 in Chapter 3,
§16) that A contains the limit of each convergent sequence {xm } ⊆ A.
Thus let xm → p, {xm } ⊆ A. As A is compact, the sequence {xm } clusters
at some q ∈ A, i.e., has a subsequence xmk → q ∈ A. However, the limit of the
subsequence must be the same as that of the entire sequence. Thus p = q ∈ A;
i.e., p is in A, as required. 
Theorem 3. Every compact set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is bounded .

Proof. By Problem 3 in Chapter 3, §13, it suffices to show that A is contained
in some finite union of globes. Thus we fix some arbitrary radius ε > 0 and,
seeking a contradiction, assume that A cannot be covered by any finite number
of globes of that radius.
Then if x1 ∈ A, the globe Gx1 (ε) does not cover A, so there is a point x2 ∈ A
such that
x2 ∈
/ Gx1 (ε), i.e., ρ(x1 , x2 ) ≥ ε.
By our assumption, A is not even covered by Gx1 (ε) ∪ Gx2 (ε). Thus there is a
point x3 ∈ A with
x3 ∈
/ Gx1 (ε) and x3 ∈
/ Gx2 (ε), i.e., ρ(x3 , x1 ) ≥ ε and ρ(x3 , x2 ) ≥ ε.
S3
Again, A is not covered by i=1 Gxi (ε), so there is a point x4 ∈ A not in that
union; its distances from x1 , x2 , and x3 must therefore be ≥ ε.
Since A is never covered by any finite number of ε-globes, we can continue
this process indefinitely (by induction) and thus select an infinite sequence
{xm } ⊆ A, with all its terms at least ε-apart from each other.
Now as A is compact, this sequence must have a convergent subsequence
{xmk }, which is then certainly Cauchy (by Theorem 1 of Chapter 3, §17). This
is impossible, however, since its terms are at distances ≥ ε from each other,
contrary to Definition 1 in Chapter 3, §17. This contradiction completes the
proof. 
Note 1. We have actually proved more than was required, namely, that no
matter how small ε > 0 is, A can be covered by finitely many globes of radius

188

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

ε with centers in A. This property is called total boundedness (Chapter 3, §13,
Problem 4).
Note 2. Thus all compact sets are closed and bounded. The converse fails
in metric spaces in general (see Problem 2 below). In E n (∗ and C n ), however,
the converse is likewise true, as we show next.
Theorem 4. In E n (∗ and C n ) a set is compact iff it is closed and bounded .
Proof. In fact, if a set A ⊆ E n (∗ C n ) is bounded, then by the Bolzano–
Weierstrass theorem, each sequence {xm } ⊆ A has a convergent subsequence
xmk → p. If A is also closed, the limit point p must belong to A itself.
Thus each sequence {xm } ⊆ A clusters at some p in A, so A is compact.
The converse is obvious. 
Note 3. In particular, every closed globe in E n (∗ or C n ) is compact since
it is bounded and closed (Chapter 3, §12, Example (6)), so Theorem 4 applies.
We conclude with an important theorem, due to G. Cantor.
Theorem 5 (Cantor’s principle of nested closed sets). Every contracting sequence of nonvoid compact sets,
F1 ⊇ F2 ⊇ · · · ⊇ Fm ⊇ · · · ,
in a metric space (S, ρ) has a nonvoid intersection; i .e., some p belongs to all
Fm .
For complete sets Fm , this holds as well, provided the diameters of the sets
Fm tend to 0: dFm → 0.

Proof. We prove the theorem for complete sets first.
As Fm 6= ∅, we can pick a point xm from each Fm to obtain a sequence
{xm }, xm ∈ Fm . Since dFm → 0, it is easy to see that {xm } is a Cauchy
sequence. (The details are left to the reader.) Moreover,
(∀ m)

xm ∈ Fm ⊆ F1 .

Thus {xm } is a Cauchy sequence in F1 , a complete set (by assumption).
Therefore, by the definition of completeness (Chapter 3, §17), {xm } has a
limit p ∈ F1 . This limit remains the same if we drop a finite number of terms,
say, the first m − 1 of them. Then we are left with the sequence xm , xm+1 , . . . ,
which, by construction, is entirely contained in Fm (why?), with the same limit
p. Then, however, the completeness of Fm implies that p ∈ Fm as well. As m
is arbitrary here, it follows that (∀ m) p ∈ Fm , i.e.,
p∈

∞
\

Fm , as claimed.

m=1

The proof for compact sets is analogous and even simpler. Here {xm } need

189

§6. Compact Sets

not be a Cauchy sequence. Instead, using the compactness of F1 , we select
from {xm } a subsequence xmk → p ∈ F1 and then proceed as above. 
Note 4. In particular, in E n we may let the sets Fm be closed intervals
(since they are compact). Then Theorem 5 yields the principle of nested intervals: Every contracting sequence of closed intervals in E n has a nonempty
intersection. (For an independent proof, see Problem 8 below.)

Problems on Compact Sets
1. Complete the missing details in the proof of Theorem 5.
2. Verify that any infinite set in a discrete space is closed and bounded but
not compact.
[Hint: In such a space no sequence of distinct terms clusters.]

3. Show that E n is not compact, in three ways:
(i) from definitions (as in Example (a′ ));
(ii) from Theorem 4; and
(iii) from Theorem 5, by finding in E n a contracting sequence of infinite
closed sets with a void intersection. For example, in E 1 take the
closed sets Fm = [m, +∞), m = 1, 2, . . . . (Are they closed?)
4. Show that E ∗ is compact under the metric ρ′ defined in Problems 5 and
6 in Chapter 3, §11. Is E 1 a compact set under that metric?
[Hint: For the first part, use Theorem 2 of Chapter 2, §13, noting that Gq is also a
globe under ρ′ . For the second, consider the sequence xn = n.]

5. Show that a set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is compact iff every infinite subset B ⊆ A
has a cluster point p ∈ A.

[Hint: Select from B a sequence {xm } of distinct terms. Then the cluster points of
{xm } are also those of B. (Why?)]

(i) If A and B are compact, so is A ∪ B, and similarly for unions of
n sets.

(ii) If the sets Ai (i ∈ I) are compact, so is i∈I Ai , even if I is infinite.

Disprove (i) for unions of infinitely many sets by a counterexample.

i∈I

Ai is sequentially closed. Then use Theorem 1.]

7. Prove that if xm → p in (S, ρ), then the set
B = {p, x1 , x2 , . . . , xm , . . . }
is compact.
[Hint: If B is finite, see Example (b). If not, use Problem 5, noting that any infinite
subset of B defines a subsequence xmk → p, so it clusters at p.]

§6. Compact Sets

As in Problem 9, subdivide F0 into 2n intervals of diagonal d/2. At least one
of them cannot be covered by finitely many Gi . (Why?) Choose one such interval,
make it closed, call it F1 , and subdivide it into 2n subintervals of diagonal d/22 .

Fm ⊆ Gp̄ (ε) ⊆ G.
Thus (contrary to our choice of the Fm ) Fm is covered by a single set Gi . This
contradiction completes the proof.]

§7. More on Compactness

Another useful approach to compactness is based on the notion of a covering
of a set (already encountered in Problem 10 in §6). We say that a set F is
covered by a family of sets Gi (i ∈ I) iff
[
F ⊆
Gi .
i∈I

If this is the case, {Gi } is called a covering of F . If the sets Gi are open, we
call the set family {Gi } an open covering. The covering {Gi } is said to be finite
(infinite, countable, etc.) iff the number of the sets Gi is.
If {Gi } is an open covering of F , then each point x ∈ F is in some Gi and is
its interior point (for Gi is open), so there is a globe Gx (εx ) ⊆ Gi . In general,
the radii εx of these globes depend on x, i.e., are different for different points
x ∈ F . If, however, they can be chosen all equal to some ε, then this ε is called
a Lebesgue number for the covering {Gi } (so named after Henri Lebesgue).
Thus ε is a Lebesgue number iff for every x ∈ F , the globe Gx (ε) is contained
in some Gi . We now obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 1 (Lebesgue). Every open covering {Gj } of a sequentially compact
set F ⊆ (S, ρ) has at least one Lebesgue number ε. In symbols,
(∃ ε > 0) (∀ x ∈ F ) (∃ i)

Gx (ε) ⊆ Gi .

(1)

Proof. Seeking a contradiction, assume that (1) fails, i.e., its negation holds.
As was explained in Chapter 1, §§1–3, this negation is
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ xε ∈ F ) (∀ i)

Gxε (ε) 6⊆ Gi

(where we write xε for x since here x may depend on ε). As this is supposed
to hold for all ε > 0, we take successively
ε = 1,

1
1
, ..., , ....
2
n

Then, replacing “xε ” by “xn ” for convenience, we obtain
1
* Gi .
(∀ n) (∃ xn ∈ F ) (∀ i) Gxn
n

(2)

Thus for each n, there is some xn ∈ F such that the globe Gxn ( n1 ) is not
contained in any Gi . We fix such an xn ∈ F for each n, thus obtaining a
sequence {xn } ⊆ F . As F is compact (by assumption), this sequence clusters
at some p ∈ F .
The point p, being in F , must be in some Gi (call it G), together with some
globe Gp (r) ⊆ G. As p is a cluster point, even the smaller globe Gp ( r2 ) contains

∗ §7.

193

More on Compactness

infinitely many xn . Thus we may choose n so large that n1 < 2r and xn ∈ Gp ( r2 ).
For that n, Gxn ( n1 ) ⊆ Gp (r) because

However, this is impossible since by (2) no Gxn ( n1 ) is contained in any Gi .
This contradiction completes the proof. 

Our next theorem might serve as an alternative definition of compactness.
In fact, in topology (which studies spaces more general than metric spaces),
this is is the basic definition of compactness. It generalizes Problem 10 in §6.
Theorem 2 (generalized Heine–Borel theorem). A set F ⊆ (S, ρ) is compact
iff every open covering of F has a finite subcovering.
That is, whenever F is covered by a family of open sets Gi (i ∈ I), F can
also be covered by a finite number of these Gi .
S
Proof. Let F be sequentially compact, and let F ⊆ Gi , all Gi open. We
have to show that {Gi } reduces to a finite subcovering.
By Theorem 1, {Gi } has a Lebesgue number ε satisfying (1). We fix this
ε > 0. Now by Note 1 in §6, we can cover F by a finite number of ε-globes,
F ⊆

n
[

k=1

Gxk (ε),

xk ∈ F.

Also by (1), each Gxk (ε) is contained in some Gi ; call it Gik . With the Gik so
fixed, we have
n

[
[
F ⊆
Gxk (ε) ⊆
Gik .
k=1

k=1

Thus the sets Gik constitute the desired finite subcovering, and the “only if”
in the theorem is proved.
Conversely, assume the condition stated in the theorem. We have to show
that F is sequentially compact, i.e., that every sequence {xm } ⊆ F clusters at
some p ∈ F .
Seeking a contradiction, suppose F contains no cluster points of {xm }. Then
by definition, each point x ∈ F is in some globe Gx containing at most finitely
many xm . The set F is covered by these open globes, hence also by finitely
many of them (by our assumption). Then, however, F contains at most finitely
many xm (namely, those contained in the so-selected globes), whereas the

194

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

sequence {xm } ⊆ F was assumed infinite. This contradiction completes the
proof. 

§8. Continuity on Compact Sets. Uniform Continuity
I. Some additional important theorems apply to functions that are continuous on a compact set (see §6).

Theorem 1. If a function f : A → (T, ρ′ ), A ⊆ (S, ρ), is relatively continuous
on a compact set B ⊆ A, then f [B] is a compact set in (T, ρ′ ). Briefly,
the continuous image of a compact set is compact.

Proof. To show that f [B] is compact, we take any sequence {ym } ⊆ f [B] and
prove that it clusters at some q ∈ f [B].
As ym ∈ f [B], ym = f (xm ) for some xm in B. We pick such an xm ∈ B for
each ym , thus obtaining a sequence {xm } ⊆ B with
f (xm ) = ym ,

m = 1, 2, . . . .

Now by the assumed compactness of B, the sequence {xm } must cluster at
some p ∈ B. Thus it has a subsequence xmk → p. As p ∈ B, the function f
is relatively continuous at p over B (by assumption). Hence by the sequential
criterion (§2), xmk → p implies f (xmk ) → f (p); i.e.,
ymk → f (p) ∈ f [B].
Thus q = f (p) is the desired cluster point of {ym }. 
This theorem can be used to prove the compactness of various sets.
Examples.
(1) A closed line segment L[ā, b̄] in E n (∗ and in other normed spaces) is
compact, for, by definition,
L[ā, b̄] = {ā + t~u | 0 ≤ t ≤ 1}, where ~u = b̄ − ā.

Thus L[ā, b̄] is the image of the compact interval [0, 1] ⊆ E 1 under the
map f : E 1 → E n , given by f (t) = ā + t~u, which is continuous by
Theorem 3 of §3. (Why?)

Lemma 1. Every nonvoid compact set F ⊆ E 1 has a maximum and a minimum.
Proof. By Theorems 2 and 3 of §6, F is closed and bounded. Thus F has an
infimum and a supremum in E 1 (by the completeness axiom), say, p = inf F
and q = sup F . It remains to show that p, q ∈ F .
Assume the opposite, say, q ∈
/ F . Then by properties of suprema, each globe
Gq (δ) = (q − δ, q + δ) contains some x ∈ B (specifically, q − δ < x < q) other
than q (for q ∈
/ B, while x ∈ B). Thus
(∀ δ > 0) F ∩ G¬q (δ) 6= ∅;
i.e., F clusters at q and hence must contain q (being closed ). However, since
q∈
/ F , this is the desired contradiction, and the lemma is proved. 
The next theorem has many important applications in analysis.
Theorem 2 (Weierstrass).
(i) If a function f : A → (T, ρ′ ) is relatively continuous on a compact set
B ⊆ A, then f is bounded on B; i.e., f [B] is bounded .

(ii) If , in addition, B 6= ∅ and f is real (f : A → E 1 ), then f [B] has a
maximum and a minimum; i .e., f attains a largest and a least value at
some points of B.
Proof. Indeed, by Theorem 1, f [B] is compact, so it is bounded, as claimed
in (i).
If further B 6= ∅ and f is real, then f [B] is a nonvoid compact set in E 1 , so
by Lemma 1, it has a maximum and a minimum in E 1 . Thus all is proved. 
Note 1. This and the other theorems of this section hold, in particular, if
B is a closed interval in E n or a closed globe in E n (∗ or C n ) (because these
sets are compact—see the examples in §6). This may fail, however, if B is
not compact, e.g., if B = (ā, b̄). For a counterexample, see Problem 11 in
Chapter 3, §13.

Theorem 3. If a function f : A → (T, ρ′ ), A ⊆ (S, ρ), is relatively continuous
on a compact set B ⊆ A and is one to one on B (i .e., when restricted to B),
then its inverse, f −1 , is continuous on f [B].1
Proof. To show that f −1 is continuous at each point q ∈ f [B], we apply the
sequential criterion (Theorem 1 in §2). Thus we fix a sequence {ym } ⊆ f [B],
ym → q ∈ f [B], and prove that f −1 (ym ) → f −1 (q).
1

Note that f need not be one to one on all of its domain A, only on B. Thus f −1 need
not be a mapping on f [A], but it is one on f [B]. (We use “f −1 ” here to denote the inverse
of f so restricted.)

196

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Let f −1 (ym ) = xm and f −1 (q) = p so that
ym = f (xm ), q = f (p), and xm , p ∈ B.
We have to show that xm → p, i.e., that
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

ρ(xm , p) < ε.

Seeking a contradiction, suppose this fails, i.e., its negation holds. Then
(see Chapter 1, §§1–3) there is an ε > 0 such that
(∀ k) (∃ mk > k)

ρ(xmk , p) ≥ ε,

(1)

where we write “mk ” for “m” to stress that the mk may be different for different
k. Thus by (1), we fix some mk for each k so that (1) holds, choosing step by
step,
mk+1 > mk , k = 1, 2, . . . .
Then the xmk form a subsequence of {xm }, and the corresponding ymk =
f (xmk ) form a subsequence of {ym }. Henceforth, for brevity, let {xm } and
{ym } themselves denote these two subsequences. Then as before, xm ∈ B,
ym = f (xm ) ∈ f [B], and ym → q, q = f (p). Also, by (1),
(∀ m)

ρ(xm , p) ≥ ε (xm stands for xmk ).

(2)

Now as {xm } ⊆ B and B is compact, {xm } has a (sub)subsequence
xmi → p′ for some p′ ∈ B.

As f is relatively continuous on B, this implies
f (xmi ) = ymi → f (p′ ).
However, the subsequence {ymi } must have the same limit as {ym }, i.e., f (p).
Thus f (p′ ) = f (p), whence p = p′ (for f is one to one on B), so xmi → p′ = p.
This contradicts (2), however, and thus the proof is complete.2 
Examples (continued).
(3) For a fixed n ∈ N , define f : [0, +∞) → E 1 by
f (x) = xn .

Then f is one to one (strictly increasing) and continuous (being a monomial ; see §3). Thus by Theorem 3, f −1 (the nth root function) is relatively
continuous on each interval
f [[a, b]] = [an , bn ],
hence on [0, +∞).
2

We call f bicontinuous if (as in our case) both f and f −1 are continuous.

197

§8. Continuity on Compact Sets. Uniform Continuity

See also Example (a) in §6 and Problem 1 below.
II. Uniform Continuity.
definition,

If f is relatively continuous on B, then by

(∀ ε > 0) (∀ p ∈ B) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ B ∩ Gp (δ))

ρ′ (f (x), f (p)) < ε.

(3)

Here, in general, δ depends on both ε and p (see Problem 4 in §1); that is, given
ε > 0, some values of δ may fit a given p but fail (3) for other points.
It may occur, however, that one and the same δ (depending on ε only)
satisfies (3) for all p ∈ B simultaneously, so that we have the stronger formula
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ p, x ∈ B | ρ(x, p) < δ) ρ′ (f (x), f (p)) < ε.3

(4)

Definition 1.
If (4) is true, we say that f is uniformly continuous on B.
Clearly, this implies (3), but the converse fails.4
Theorem 4. If a function f : A → (T, ρ′ ), A ⊆ (S, ρ), is relatively continuous
on a compact set B ⊂ A, then f is also uniformly continuous on B.
Proof (by contradiction). Suppose f is relatively continuous on B, but (4)
fails. Then there is an ε > 0 such that
(∀ δ > 0) (∃ p, x ∈ B)

ρ(x, p) < δ, and yet ρ′ (f (x), f (p)) ≥ ε;

here p and x depend on δ. We fix such an ε and let
δ = 1,

1
1
, ..., , ....
2
m

Then for each δ (i.e., each m), we get two points xm , pm ∈ B with
ρ(xm , pm ) <

1
m

(5)

m = 1, 2, . . . .

(6)

and
ρ′ (f (xm ), f (pm )) ≥ ε,

Thus we obtain two sequences, {xm } and {pm }, in B. As B is compact,
{xm } has a subsequence xmk → q (q ∈ B). For simplicity, let it be {xm } itself;
thus
xm → q, q ∈ B.
3
4

In other words, f (x) and f (p) are ε-close for any p, x ∈ B with ρ(p, x) < δ.
See Example (h) below.

198

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Hence by (5), it easily follows that also pm → q (because ρ(xm , pm ) → 0; see
Problem 4 in Chapter 3, §17). By the assumed relative continuity of f on B,
it follows that
f (xm ) → f (q) and f (pm ) → f (q) in (T, ρ′ ).
This, in turn, implies that ρ′ (f (xm ), f (pm )) → 0, which is impossible, in view
of (6). This contradiction completes the proof. 
One type of uniformly continuous functions are so-called contraction mappings. We define them in Example (a) below and hence derive a few noteworthy
special cases. Some of them are so-called isometries (see Problems, footnote 5).
Examples.
(a) A function f : A → (T, ρ′ ), A ⊆ (S, ρ), is called a contraction map (on
A) iff
ρ(x, y) ≥ ρ′ (f (x), f (y)) for all x, y ∈ A.
Any such map is uniformly continuous on A. In fact, given ε > 0, we
simply take δ = ε. Then (∀ x, p ∈ A)
ρ(x, p) < δ implies ρ′ (f (x), f (p)) ≤ ρ(x, p) < δ = ε,
as required in (3).
(b) As a special case, consider the absolute value map (norm map) given by
f (x̄) = |x̄| on E n (∗ or another normed space).
It is uniformly continuous on E n because
|x̄| − |p̄| ≤ |x̄ − p̄|, i.e., ρ′ (f (x̄), f (p̄)) ≤ ρ(x̄, p̄),
which shows that f is a contraction map, so Example (a) applies.
(c) Other examples of contraction maps are
(1) constant maps (see §1, Example (a)) and
(2) projection maps (see the proof of Theorem 3 in §3).
Verify!
(d) Define f : E 1 → E 1 by
f (x) = sin x

199

By elementary trigonometry, | sin x| ≤ |x|. Thus (∀ x, p ∈ E 1 )

and f is a contraction map again. Hence the sine function is uniformly
continuous on E 1 ; similarly for the cosine function.
(e) Given ∅ =
6 A ⊆ (S, ρ), define f : S → E 1 by
f (x) = ρ(x, A) where ρ(x, A) = inf ρ(x, y).
y∈A

It is easy to show that
(∀ x, p ∈ S)

ρ(x, A) ≤ ρ(x, p) + ρ(p, A),

i.e.,
f (x) ≤ ρ(p, x) + f (p), or f (x) − f (p) ≤ ρ(p, x).
Similarly, f (p) − f (x) ≤ ρ(p, x). Thus
|f (x) − f (p)| ≤ ρ(p, x);
i.e., f is uniformly continuous (being a contraction map).
(f) The identity map f : (S, ρ) → (S, ρ), given by
f (x) = x,
is uniformly continuous on S since
ρ(f (x), f (p)) = ρ(x, p) (a contraction map!).
However, even relative continuity could fail if the metric in the domain
space S were not the same as in S when regarded as the range space
(e.g., make ρ′ discrete!)
(g) Define f : E 1 → E 1 by
f (x) = a + bx (b 6= 0).
Then
(∀ x, p ∈ E 1 )

|f (x) − f (p)| = |b| |x − p|;

i.e.,
ρ(f (x), f (p)) = |b| ρ(x, p).

200

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Thus, given ε > 0, take δ = ε/|b|. Then
ρ(x, p) < δ =⇒ ρ(f (x), f (p)) = |b| ρ(x, p) < |b| δ = ε,
proving uniform continuity.

(i) if f and h are bounded on B, then hf is uniformly continuous on
B;
(ii) the function f /h is uniformly continuous on B if f is bounded on
B and h is “bounded away” from 0 on B, i.e.,
(∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ B)

|h(x)| ≥ δ.

Give examples to show that without these additional conditions, hf and
f /h may not be uniformly continuous (see Problem 14 below).
14. In the following cases, show that f is uniformly continuous on B ⊆ E 1 ,
but only continuous (in the ordinary sense) on D, as indicated, with
0 < a < b < +∞.

(a) f (x) = 2 ; B = [a, +∞); D = (0, 1).

(b) f (x) = x2 ; B = [a, b]; D = [a, +∞).

(c) f (x) = sin ; B and D as in (a).
x
(d) f (x) = x cos x; B and D as in (b).
15. Prove that if f is uniformly continuous on B, it is so on each subset
A ⊆ B.

16. For nonvoid sets A, B ⊆ (S, ρ), define

ρ(A, B) = inf{ρ(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B}.
Prove that if ρ(A, B) > 0 and if f is uniformly continuous on each of A
and B, it is so on A ∪ B.
Show by an example that this fails if ρ(A, B) = 0, even if A ∩ B = ∅
(e.g., take A = [0, 1], B = (1, 2] in E 1 , making f constant on each of A
and B).
Note, however, that if A and B are compact, A ∩ B = ∅ implies
ρ(A, B) > 0. (Prove it using Problem 13 in §6.) Thus A ∩ B = ∅
suffices in this case.
17. Prove that if f is relatively continuous on each of the disjoint closed sets
F1 , F2 , . . . , Fn ,
it is relatively continuous on their union
F =

hence (see Problem 6 of §6) it is uniformly continuous on F if the Fk
are compact.
[Hint: Fix any p ∈ F . Then p is in some Fk , say, p ∈ F1 . As the Fk are disjoint,
p∈
/ F2 , . . . , Fp ; hence p also is no cluster point of any of F2 , . . . , Fn (for they are
closed).
Deduce that there is a globe Gp (δ) disjoint from each of F2 , . . . , Fn , so that
F ∩ Gp (δ) = F1 ∩ Gp (δ). From this it is easy to show that relative continuity of f
on F follows from relative continuity on F1 .]

⇒18. Let p̄0 , p̄1 , . . . , p̄m be fixed points in E n (∗ or in another normed space).
Let
f (t) = p̄k + (t − k)(p̄k+1 − p̄k )
whenever k ≤ t ≤ k + 1, t ∈ E 1 , k = 0, 1, . . . , m − 1.
Show that this defines a uniformly continuous mapping f of the interval [0, m] ⊆ E 1 onto the “polygon”
m−1
[

L[pk , pk+1 ].

k=0

In what case is f one to one? Is f −1 uniformly continuous on each
L[pk , pk+1 ]? On the entire polygon?
[Hint: First prove ordinary continuity on [0, m] using Theorem 1 of §3. (For the
points 1, 2, . . . , m − 1, consider left and right limits.) Then use Theorems 1–4.]

19. Prove the sequential criterion for uniform continuity: A function
f : A → T is uniformly continuous on a set B ⊆ A iff for any two
(not necessarily convergent) sequences {xm } and {ym } in B, with
ρ(xm , ym ) → 0, we have ρ′ (f (xm ), f (ym )) → 0 (i.e., f preserves concurrent pairs of sequences; see Problem 4 in Chapter 3, §17).

§9. The Intermediate Value Property
Definition 1.
A function f : A → E ∗ is said to have the intermediate value property,
or Darboux property,1 on a set B ⊆ A iff, together with any two function
values f (p) and f (p1 ) (p, p1 ∈ B), it also takes all intermediate values
between f (p) and f (p1 ) at some points of B.
In other words, the image set f [B] contains the entire interval between
f (p) and f (p1 ) in E ∗ .
1

This property is named after Jean Gaston Darboux, who investigated it for derivatives
(see Chapter 5, §2, Theorem 4).

204

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Note 1. It follows that f [B] itself is a finite or infinite interval in E ∗ , with
endpoints inf f [B] and sup f [B]. (Verify!)
Geometrically, if A ⊆ E 1 , this means that the curve y = f (x) meets all
horizontal lines y = q, for q between f (p) and f (p1 ). For example, in Figure 13
in §1, we have a “smooth” curve that cuts each horizontal line y = q between
f (0) and f (p1 ); so f has the Darboux property on [0, p1 ]. In Figures 14 and
15, there is a “gap” at p; the property fails. In Example (f) of §1, the property
holds on all of E 1 despite a discontinuity at 0. Thus it does not imply continuity.
Intuitively, it seems plausible that a “continuous curve” must cut all intermediate horizontals. A precise proof for functions continuous on an interval,
was given independently by Bolzano and Weierstrass (the same as in Theorem 2
of Chapter 3, §16). Below we give a more general version of Bolzano’s proof
based on the notion of a convex set and related concepts.
Definition 2.
A set B in E n (∗ or in another normed space) is said to be convex iff for
each ā, b̄ ∈ B the line segment L[ā, b̄] is a subset of B.
A polygon joining ā and b̄ is any finite union of line segments (a “broken
line”) of the form
m−1
[

L[p̄i , p̄i+1 ] with p̄0 = ā and p̄m = b̄.

i=0

The set B is said to be polygon connected (or piecewise convex ) iff any two
points ā, b̄ ∈ B can be joined by a polygon contained in B.

Example.
Any globe in E n (∗ or in another normed space) is convex, so also is any
interval in E n or in E ∗ . Figures 19 and 20 represent a convex set A and
a polygon-connected set B in E 2 (B is not convex; it has a “cavity”).
We shall need a simple lemma that is noteworthy in its own right as well.

205

§9. The Intermediate Value Property

Lemma 1 (principle of nested line segments). Every contracting sequence of
closed line segments L[p̄m , q̄m ] in E n (∗ or in any other normed space) has a
nonvoid intersection; i .e., there is a point
p̄ ∈

∞
\

L[p̄m , q̄m ].

m=1

Proof. Use Cantor’s theorem (Theorem 5 of §6) and Example (1) in §8. 
We are now ready for Bolzano’s theorem. The proof to be used is typical of
so-called “bisection proofs.” (See also §6, Problems 9 and 10 for such proofs.)

Theorem 1. If f : B → E 1 is relatively continuous on a polygon-connected
set B in E n (∗ or in another normed space), then f has the Darboux property
on B.
In particular , if B is convex and if f (p̄) < c < f (q̄) for some p̄, q̄ ∈ B, then
there is a point r̄ ∈ L(p̄, q̄) such that f (r̄) = c.
Proof. First, let B be convex . Seeking a contradiction, suppose p̄, q̄ ∈ B with
f (p̄) < c < f (q̄),
yet f (x̄) 6= c for all x̄ ∈ L(p̄, q̄).
Let P be the set of all those x̄ ∈ L[p̄, q̄] for which f (x̄) < c, i.e.,
P = {x̄ ∈ L[p̄, q̄] | f (x̄) < c},
and let
Q = {x̄ ∈ L[p̄, q̄] | f (x̄) > c}.

Then p̄ ∈ P , q̄ ∈ Q, P ∩ Q = ∅, and P ∪ Q = L[p̄, q̄] ⊆ B. (Why?)
Now let
1
r̄0 = (p̄ + q̄)
2
be the midpoint on L[p̄, q̄]. Clearly, r̄0 is either in P or in Q. Thus it bisects
L[p̄, q̄] into two subsegments, one of which must have its left endpoint in P and
its right endpoint in Q.2
We denote this particular closed segment by L[p̄1 , q̄1 ], p̄1 ∈ P , q̄1 ∈ Q. We
then have
1
L[p̄1 , q̄1 ] ⊆ L[p̄, q̄] and |p1 − q1 | = |p̄ − q̄|. (Verify!)
2
Now we bisect L[p̄1 , q̄1 ] and repeat the process. Thus let
r̄1 =
2

1
(p̄1 + q̄1 ).
2

Indeed, if r̄0 ∈ P , this holds for L[r̄0 , q̄]. If r̄0 ∈ Q, take L[p̄, r̄0 ].

206

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

By the same argument, we obtain a closed subsegment L[p̄2 , q̄2 ] ⊆ L[p̄1 , q̄1 ],
with p̄2 ∈ P , q̄2 ∈ Q, and
|p̄2 − q̄2 | =

1
1
|p̄1 − q̄1 | = |p̄ − q̄|.
2
4

Next, we bisect L[p̄2 , q̄2 ], and so on. Continuing this process indefinitely, we
obtain an infinite contracting sequence of closed line segments L[p̄m , q̄m ] such
that
(∀ m) p̄m ∈ P, q̄m ∈ Q,
and
|p̄m − q̄m | =

1
|p̄ − q̄| → 0 as m → +∞.
2m

By Lemma 1, there is a point
r̄ ∈

∞
\

L[p̄m , q̄m ].

m=1

This implies that
(∀ m)

|r̄ − p̄m | ≤ |p̄m − q̄m | → 0,

whence p̄m → r̄. Similarly, we obtain q̄m → r̄.
Now since r̄ ∈ L[p̄, q̄] ⊆ B, the function f is relatively continuous at r̄ over
B (by assumption). By the sequential criterion, then,
f (p̄m ) → f (r̄) and f (q̄m ) → f (r̄).
Moreover, f (p̄m ) < c < f (q̄m ) (for p̄m ∈ P and q̄m ∈ Q). Letting m → +∞,
we pass to limits (Chapter 3, §15, Corollary 1) and get
f (r̄) ≤ c ≤ f (r̄),
so that r̄ is neither in P nor in Q, which is a contradiction. This completes
the proof for a convex B.
The extension to polygon-connected sets is left as an exercise (see Problem
2 below). Thus all is proved. 
Note 2. In particular, the theorem applies if B is a globe or an interval.
Thus continuity on an interval implies the Darboux property. The converse
fails, as we have noted. However, for monotone functions, we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 2. If a function f : A → E 1 is monotone and has the Darboux
property on a finite or infinite interval (a, b) ⊆ A ⊆ E 1 , then it is continuous
on (a, b).
Proof. Seeking a contradiction, suppose f is discontinuous at some p ∈ (a, b).

§9. The Intermediate Value Property

207

For definiteness, let f ↑ on (a, b). Then by Theorems 2 and 3 in §5, we
have either f (p− ) < f (p) or f (p) < f (p+ ) or both, with no function values in
between.
On the other hand, since f has the Darboux property, the function values
f (x) for x in (a, b) fill an entire interval (see Note 1). Thus it is impossible
for f (p) to be the only function value between f (p− ) and f (p+ ) unless f is
constant near p, but then it is also continuous at p, which we excluded. This
contradiction completes the proof.3 
Note 3. The theorem holds (with a similar proof) for nonopen intervals as
well, but the continuity at the endpoints is relative (right at a, left at b).
Theorem 3. If f : A → E 1 is strictly monotone and continuous when restricted to a finite or infinite interval B ⊆ A ⊆ E 1 , then its inverse f −1 has
the same properties on the set f [B] (itself an interval , by Note 1 and Theorem 1).4
Proof. It is easy to see that f −1 is increasing (decreasing) if f is; the proof is
left as an exercise. Thus f −1 is monotone on f [B] if f is so on B. To prove
the relative continuity of f −1 , we use Theorem 2, i.e., show that f −1 has the
Darboux property on f [B].
Thus let f −1 (p) < c < f −1 (q) for some p, q ∈ f [B]. We look for an r ∈ f [B]
such that f −1 (r) = c, i.e., r = f (c). Now since p, q ∈ f [B], the numbers f −1 (p)
and f −1 (q) are in B, an interval . Hence also the intermediate value c is in B;
thus it belongs to the domain of f , and so the function value f (c) exists. It
thus suffices to put r = f (c) to get the result. 
Examples.
(a) Define f : E 1 → E 1 by
f (x) = xn for a fixed n ∈ N .
As f is continuous (being a monomial ), it has the Darboux property
on E 1 . By Note 1, setting B = [0, +∞), we have f [B] = [0, +∞).
(Why?) Also, f is strictly increasing on B. Thus by Theorem 3, the
inverse function f −1 (i.e., the nth root function) exists and is continuous
on f [B] = [0, +∞).
If n is odd
, then f −1 has these properties on all of E 1 , by a similar
√
proof; thus n x exists for x ∈ E 1 .

(b) Logarithmic functions. From the example in §5, we recall that the expo3

More formally, if, say, f (p) < f (p+ ), let f (p) < c < f (p+ ) ≤ f (p′ ), p′ ∈ (p, b). (Such a
exists since f ↑, and f (p+ ) = inf{f (x) | p < x < b}; see §5, Theorem 1.) By the Darboux
property, f (x) = c for some x ∈ (a, b), but this contradicts Theorem 2 in §5.
4 We write “f ” for “f restricted to B” as well; cf. also footnote 1 in §8.

nential function given by
F (x) = ax

(a > 0)

is continuous and strictly monotone on E 1 .5 Its inverse, F −1 , is called
the logarithmic function to the base a, denoted loga . By Theorem 3, it is
continuous and strictly monotone on F [E 1 ].
To fix ideas, let a > 1, so F ↑ and (F −1 )↑. By Note 1, F [E 1 ] is an
interval with endpoints p and r, where
p = inf F [E 1 ] = inf{ax | −∞ < x < +∞}
and
r = sup F [E 1 ] = sup{ax | −∞ < x < +∞}.
Now by Problem 14(iii) of §2 (with q = 0),
lim ax = +∞ and

x→+∞

lim ax = 0.

x→−∞

As F ↑, we use Theorem 1 in §5 to obtain
r = sup ax = lim ax = +∞ and p = lim ax = 0.
x→+∞

x→−∞

Thus F [E 1 ], i.e., the domain of loga , is the interval (p, r) = (0, +∞). It
follows that loga x is uniquely defined for x in (0, +∞); it is called the
logarithm of x to the base a.
The range of loga (i.e. of F −1 ) is the same as the domain of F , i.e., E 1 .
Thus if a > 1, loga x increases from −∞ to +∞ as x increases from 0 to
+∞. Hence
lim loga x = +∞ and lim loga x = −∞,

x→+∞

x→0+

provided a > 1.
If 0 < a < 1, the values of these limits are interchanged (since F ↓ in
this case), but otherwise the results are the same.
If a = e, we write ln x or log x for loga x, and we call ln x the natural
logarithm of x. Its inverse is, of course, the exponential f (x) = ex , also
written exp(x). Thus by definition, ln ex = x and
x = exp(ln x) = eln x

(0 < x < +∞).

(c) The power function g : (0, +∞) → E 1 is defined by
g(x) = xa for a fixed real a.
5

We exclude the case a = 1 here.

(1)

209

§9. The Intermediate Value Property

If a > 0, we also define g(0) = 0. For x > 0, we have
xa = exp(ln xa ) = exp(a · ln x).
Thus by the rules for composite functions (Theorem 3 and Corollary 2 in
§2), the continuity of g on (0, +∞) follows from that of exponential and
log functions. If a > 0, g is also continuous at 0. (Exercise!)

§10. Arcs and Curves. Connected Sets

§10. Arcs and Curves. Connected Sets
A deeper insight into continuity and the Darboux property can be gained by
generalizing the notions of a convex set and polygon-connected set to obtain
so-called connected sets.
I. As a first step, we consider arcs and curves.
Definition 1.
A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is called an arc iff A is a continuous image of a compact
interval [a, b] ⊂ E 1 , i.e., iff there is a continuous mapping
f : [a, b] −→ A.
onto

If, in addition, f is one to one, A is called a simple arc with endpoints
f (a) and f (b).
If instead f (a) = f (b), we speak of a closed curve.
A curve is a continuous image of any finite or infinite interval in E 1 .
Corollary 1. Each arc is a compact (hence closed and bounded ) set (by
Theorem 1 of §8).
Definition 2.

A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is said to be arcwise connected iff every two points
p, q ∈ A are in some simple arc contained in A. (We then also say the p
and q can be joined by an arc in A.)
Examples.
(a) Every closed line segment L[ā, b̄] in E n (∗ or in any other normed space)
is a simple arc (consider the map f in Example (1) of §8).

(b) Every polygon

A=

m−1
[

L[p̄i , p̄i+1 ]

i=0

is an arc (see Problem 18 in §8). It is a simple arc if the half-closed
segments L[p̄i , p̄i+1 ) do not intersect and the points p̄i are distinct, for
then the map f in Problem 18 of §8 is one to one.

(c) It easily follows that every polygon-connected set is also arcwise connected ; one only has to show that every polygon joining two points p̄0 , p̄m
can be reduced to a simple polygon (not a self-intersecting one). See
Problem 2.
However, the converse is false. For example, two discs in E 2 connected
by a parabolic arc form together an arcwise- (but not polygonwise-) connected set.

212

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

(d) Let f1 , f2 , . . . , fn be real continuous functions on an interval I ⊆ E 1 .
Treat them as components of a function f : I → E n ,
f = (f1 , . . . , fn ).
Then f is continuous by Theorem 2 in §3. Thus the image set f [I] is a
curve in E n ; it is an arc if I is a closed interval.
Introducing a parameter t varying over I, we obtain the parametric
equations of the curve, namely,
xk = fk (t),

k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

Then as t varies over I, the point x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xn ) describes the curve
f [I]. This is the usual way of treating curves in E n (∗ and C n ).
It is not hard to show that Theorem 1 in §9 holds also if B is only arcwise
connected (see Problem 3 below). However, much more can be proved by
introducing the general notion of a connected set. We do this next.
∗

II. For this topic, we shall need Theorems 2–4 of Chapter 3, §12, and
Problem 15 of Chapter 4, §2. The reader is advised to review them. In particular, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1. A function f : (A, ρ) → (T, ρ′ ) is continuous on A iff f −1 [B] is
closed in (A, ρ) for each closed set B ⊆ (T, ρ′ ); similarly for open sets.
Indeed, this is part of Problem 15 in §2 with (S, ρ) replaced by (A, ρ).

Definition 3.

A metric space (S, ρ) is said to be connected iff S is not the union P ∪ Q
of any two nonvoid disjoint closed sets; it is disconnected otherwise.1
A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is called connected iff (A, ρ) is connected as a subspace
of (S, ρ); i.e., iff A is not a union of two disjoint sets P, Q 6= ∅ that are
closed (hence also open) in (A, ρ), as a subspace of (S, ρ).
Note 1. By Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, §12, this means that
P = A ∩ P1 and Q = A ∩ Q1
for some sets P1 , Q1 that are closed in (S, ρ). Observe that, unlike compact
sets, a set that is closed or open in (A, ρ) need not be closed or open in (S, ρ).
Examples.
(a′ ) ∅ is connected.

(b′ ) So is any one-point set {p}. (Why?)
1

The term “closed” may be replaced by “open” here, for P and Q are open as well, each
being the complement of the other closed set. Similarly, if they are open, they are both open
and closed (briefly, “clopen”).

213

§10. Arcs and Curves. Connected Sets

(c′ ) Any finite set of two or more points is disconnected. (Why?)
Other examples are provided by the theorems that follow.
Theorem 2. The only connected sets in E 1 are exactly all convex sets, i .e., finite and infinite intervals, including E 1 itself .
Proof. The proof that such intervals are exactly all convex sets in E 1 is left
as an exercise.
We now show that each connected set A ⊆ E 1 is convex, i.e., that a, b ∈ A
implies (a, b) ⊆ A.
Seeking a contradiction, suppose p ∈
/ A for some p ∈ (a, b), a, b ∈ A. Let
P = A ∩ (−∞, p) and Q = A ∩ (p, +∞).
Then A = P ∪ Q, a ∈ P , b ∈ Q, and P ∩ Q = ∅. Moreover, (−∞, p) and
(p, +∞) are open sets in E 1 . (Why?) Hence P and Q are open in A, each
being the intersection of A with a set open in E 1 (see Note 1 above). As
A = P ∪ Q, with P ∩ Q = ∅, it follows that A is disconnected . This shows that
if A is connected in E 1 , it must be convex.
Conversely, let A be convex in E 1 . The proof that A is connected is an
almost exact copy of the proof given for Theorem 1 of §9, so we only briefly
sketch it here.2
If A were disconnected, then A = P ∪ Q for some disjoint sets P, Q 6= ∅,
both closed in A. Fix any p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Exactly as in Theorem 1 of §9,
select a contracting sequence of line segments (intervals) [pm , qm ] ⊆ A such
that pm ∈ P , qm ∈ Q, and |pm − qm | → 0, and obtain a point
r∈

∞
\

m=1

[pm , qm ] ⊆ A,

so that pm → r, qm → r, and r ∈ A. As the sets P and Q are closed in
(A, ρ), Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, §16 shows that both P and Q must contain the
common limit r of the sequences {pm } ⊆ P and {qm } ⊆ Q. This is impossible,
however, since P ∩ Q = ∅, by assumption. This contradiction shows that A
cannot be disconnected. Thus all is proved. 
Note 2. By the same proof, any convex set in a normed space is connected .
In particular, E n and all other normed spaces are connected themselves.3

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Proof. By definition (§1), relative continuity on B becomes ordinary continuity when f is restricted to B. Thus we may treat f as a mapping of B into
f [B], replacing S and T by their subspaces B and f [B].
Seeking a contradiction, suppose f [B] is disconnected, i.e.,
f [B] = P ∪ Q
for some disjoint sets P, Q 6= ∅ closed in (f [B], ρ′ ). Then by Theorem 1, with
T replaced by f [B], the sets f −1 [P ] and f −1 [Q] are closed in (B, ρ). They also
are nonvoid and disjoint (as are P and Q) and satisfy
B = f −1 [P ∪ Q] = f −1 [P ] ∪ f −1 [Q]
(see Chapter 1, §§4–7, Problem 6). Thus B is disconnected, contrary to assumption. 
Corollary 2. All arcs and curves are connected sets (by Definition 2 and
Theorems 2 and 3).
Lemma 1. A set A ⊆ (S, ρ) is connected iff any two points p, q ∈ A are in
some connected subset B ⊆ A. Hence any arcwise connected set is connected .
Proof. Seeking a contradiction, suppose the condition stated in Lemma 1
holds but A is disconnected, so A = P ∪ Q for some disjoint sets P 6= ∅, Q 6= ∅,
both closed in (A, ρ).
Pick any p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. By assumption, p and q are in some connected
set B ⊆ A. Treat (B, ρ) as a subspace of (A, ρ), and let
P ′ = B ∩ P and Q′ = B ∩ Q.
Then by Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, §12, P ′ and Q′ are closed in B. Also, they
are disjoint (for P and Q are) and nonvoid (for p ∈ P ′ , q ∈ Q′ ), and
B = B ∩ A = B ∩ (P ∪ Q) = (B ∩ P ) ∪ (B ∩ Q) = P ′ ∪ Q′ .
Thus B is disconnected, contrary to assumption. This contradiction proves the
lemma (the converse proof is trivial).
In particular, if A is arcwise connected, then any points p, q in A are in
some arc B ⊆ A, a connected set by Corollary 2. Thus all is proved. 
Corollary 3. Any convex or polygon-connected set (e.g., a globe) in E n (or
in any other normed space) is arcwise connected , hence connected .
Proof. Use Lemma 1 and Example (c) in part I of this section. 
Caution: The converse fails. A connected set need not be arcwise connected,
let alone polygon connected (see Problem 17). However, we have the following
theorem.

215

§10. Arcs and Curves. Connected Sets

Theorem 4. Every open connected set A in E n (∗ or in another normed space)
is also arcwise connected and even polygon connected .
Proof. If A = ∅, this is “vacuously” true, so let A 6= ∅ and fix ā ∈ A.
Let P be the set of all p̄ ∈ A that can be joined with ā by a polygon K ⊆ A.
Let Q = A − P . Clearly, ā ∈ P , so P 6= ∅. We shall show that P is open,
i.e., that each p̄ ∈ P is in a globe Gp̄ ⊆ P .
Thus we fix any p̄ ∈ P . As A is open and p̄ ∈ A, there certainly is a globe
Gp̄ contained in A. Moreover, as Gp̄ is convex, each point x̄ ∈ Gp̄ is joined
with p̄ by the line segment L[x̄, p̄] ⊆ Gp̄ . Also, as p̄ ∈ P , some polygon K ⊆ A
joins p̄ with ā. Then
K ∪ L[x̄, p̄]
is a polygon joining x̄ and ā, and hence by definition x̄ ∈ P . Thus each x̄ ∈ Gp̄
is in P , so that Gp̄ ⊆ P , as required, and P is open (also open in A as a
subspace).
Next, we show that the set Q = A − P is open as well. As before, if Q 6= ∅,
fix any q̄ ∈ Q and a globe Gq̄ ⊆ A, and show that Gq̄ ⊆ Q. Indeed, if some
x̄ ∈ Gq̄ were not in Q, it would be in P , and thus it would be joined with ā
(fixed above) by a polygon K ⊆ A. Then, however, q̄ itself could be so joined
by the polygon
L[q̄, x̄] ∪ K,
implying that q̄ ∈ P , not q̄ ∈ Q. This shows that Gq̄ ⊂ Q indeed, as claimed.
Thus A = P ∪ Q with P, Q disjoint and open (hence clopen) in A. The
connectedness of A then implies that Q = ∅. (P is not empty, as has been
noted.) Hence A = P . By the definition of P , then, each point b̄ ∈ A can be
joined to ā by a polygon. As ā ∈ A was arbitrary, A is polygon connected. 
Finally, we obtain a stronger version of the intermediate value theorem.
Theorem 5. If a function f : A → E 1 is relatively continuous on a connected
set B ⊆ A ⊆ (S, ρ), then f has the Darboux property on B.

In fact, by Theorems 3 and 2, f [B] is a connected set in E 1 , i.e., an interval .
This, however, implies the Darboux property.

§11. Product Spaces. Double and Iterated Limits

Given two metric spaces (X, ρ1 ) and (Y, ρ2 ), we may consider the Cartesian
product X × Y , suitably metrized . Two metrics for X × Y are suggested in
Problem 10 in Chapter 3, §11. We shall adopt the first of them as follows.
Definition 1.
By the product of two metric spaces (X, ρ1 ) and (Y, ρ2 ) is meant the
space (X × Y, ρ), where the metric ρ is defined by
ρ((x, y), (x′ , y ′ )) = max{ρ1 (x, x′ ), ρ2 (y, y ′ )}

(1)

for x, x′ ∈ X and y, y ′ ∈ Y .
Thus the distance between (x, y) and (x′ , y ′ ) is the larger of the two distances
ρ1 (x, x′ ) in X and ρ2 (y, y ′ ) in Y .
The verification that ρ in (1) is, indeed, a metric is left to the reader. We now
obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
(i) A globe G(p, q) (ε) in (X ×Y, ρ) is the Cartesian product of the corresponding ε-globes in X and Y ,
G(p, q) (ε) = Gp (ε) × Gq (ε).
(ii) Convergence of sequences {(xm , ym )} in X × Y is componentwise. That
is, we have
(xm , ym ) → (p, q) in X × Y iff xm → p in X and ym → q in Y .

∗ §11.

Product Spaces. Double and Iterated Limits

219

Again, the easy proof is left as an exercise.
In this connection, recall that by Theorem 2 of Chapter 3, §15, convergence
in E 2 is componentwise as well , even though the standard metric in E 2 is not
the product metric (1); it is rather the metric (ii) of Problem 10 in Chapter 3,
§11. We might have adopted this second metric for X × Y as well. Then part
(i) of Theorem 1 would fail, but part (ii) would still follow by making
ε
ε
ρ1 (xm , p) < √ and ρ2 (ym , q) < √ .
2
2
It follows that, as far as convergence is concerned, the two choices of ρ are
equivalent.
Note 1. More generally, two metrics for a space S are said to be equivalent
iff exactly the same sequences converge (to the same limits) under both metrics.
Then also all function limits are the same since they reduce to sequential limits,
by Theorem 1 of §2; similarly for such notions as continuity, compactness,
completeness, closedness, openness, etc.
In view of this, we shall often call X ×Y a product space (in the wider sense)
even if its metric is not the ρ of formula (1) but equivalent to it. In this sense,
E 2 is the product space E 1 × E 1 , and X × Y is its generalization.
Various ideas valid in E 2 extend quite naturally to X × Y . Thus functions
defined on a set A ⊆ X × Y may be treated as functions of two variables x,
y such that (x, y) ∈ A. Given (p, q) ∈ X × Y , we may consider ordinary or
relative limits at (p, q), e.g., limits over a path
B = {(x, y) ∈ X × Y | y = q}
(briefly called the “line y = q”). In this case, y remains fixed (y = q) while
x → p; we then speak of limits and continuity in one variable x, as opposed to
those in both variables jointly, i.e., the ordinary limits (cf. §3, part IV).
Some other kinds of limits are to be defined below. For simplicity, we consider only functions f : (X × Y ) → (T, ρ′ ) defined on all of X × Y . If confusion
is unlikely, we write ρ for all metrics involved (such as ρ′ in T ). Below, p and q
always denote cluster points of X and Y , respectively (this justifies the “lim”
notation). Of course, our definitions apply in particular to E 2 as the simplest
special case of X × Y .
Definition 2.
A function f : (X × Y ) → (T, ρ′ ) is said to have the double limit s ∈ T
at (p, q), denoted
s = x→p
lim f (x, y),
y→q

iff for each ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that f (x, y) ∈ Gs (ε) whenever

220

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

x ∈ G¬p (δ) and y ∈ G¬q (δ). In symbols,
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ G¬p (δ)) (∀ y ∈ G¬q (δ))

f (x, y) ∈ Gs (ε).

(2)

Observe that this is the relative limit over the path
D = (X − {p}) × (Y − {q})
excluding the two “lines” x = p and y = q. If f were restricted to D, this
would coincide with the ordinary nonrelative limit (see §1), denoted
s=

lim

(x, y)→(p, q)

f (x, y),

where only the point (p, q) is excluded. Then we would have
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ (x, y) ∈ G¬(p,q) (δ))

f (x, y) ∈ Gs (ε).

(3)

Now consider limits in one variable, say,
lim f (x, y) with x fixed .

y→q

If this limit exists for each choice of x from some set B ⊆ X, it defines a
function
g: B → T
with value
g(x) = lim f (x, y),
y→q

x ∈ B.

This means that
(∀ x ∈ B) (∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ y ∈ G¬q (δ))

ρ(g(x), f (x, y)) < ε.

(4)

Here, in general, δ depends on both ε and x. However, in some cases (resembling uniform continuity), one and the same δ (depending on ε only) fits
all choices of x from B. This suggests the following definition.
Definition 3.
With the previous notation, suppose
lim f (x, y) = g(x) exists for each x ∈ B (B ⊆ X).

y→q

We say that this limit is uniform in x (on B), and we write
“g(x) = lim f (x, y) (uniformly for x ∈ B),”
y→q

iff for each ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that ρ(g(x), f (x, y)) < ε for all
x ∈ B and all y ∈ G¬q (δ). In symbols,
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ B) (∀ y ∈ G¬q (δ))

ρ(g(x), f (x, y)) < ε.

(5)

∗ §11.

221

Product Spaces. Double and Iterated Limits

Usually, the set B in formulas (4) and (5) is a deleted neighborhood of p in
X, e.g.,
B = G¬p (r), or B = X − {p}.
Assume (4) for such a B, so
lim f (x, y) = g(x) exists for each x ∈ B.

y→q

If, in addition,
lim g(x) = s

x→p

exists, we call s the iterated limit of f at (p, q) (first in y, then in x), denoted
lim lim f (x, y).

x→p y→q

This limit is obtained by first letting y → q (with x fixed) and then letting
x → p. Quite similarly, we define
lim lim f (x, y).

y→q x→p

In general, the two iterated limits (if they exist) are different, and their
existence does not imply that of the double limit (2), let alone (3), nor does it
imply the equality of all these limits. (See Problems 4ff below.) However, we
have the following theorem.
Theorem 2 (Osgood). Let (T, ρ′ ) be complete. Assume the existence of the
following limits of the function f : X × Y → T :
(i) lim f (x, y) = g(x) (uniformly for x ∈ X − {p}) and
y→q

(ii) lim f (x, y) = h(y) for y ∈ Y − {q}.1
x→p

Then the double limit and the two iterated limits of f at (p, q) exist and all
three coincide.
Proof. Let ε > 0. By our assumption (i), there is a δ > 0 such that
(∀ x ∈ X − {p}) (∀ y ∈ G¬q (δ))

ρ(g(x), f (x, y)) <

ε
4

(cf. (5)).

(5′ )

Now take any y ′ , y ′′ ∈ G¬q (δ). By assumption (ii), there is an x′ ∈ X − {p}
so close to p that
ρ(h(y ′ ), f (x′ , y ′ )) <
1

ε
ε
and ρ(h(y ′′ ), f (x′ , y ′′ )) < . (Why?)
4
4

Actually, it suffices to assume the existence of the limits (i) and (ii) for x in some G¬p (r)
and y in some G¬q (r). Of course, it does not matter which of the two limits is uniform.

222

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Hence, using (5′ ) and the triangle law (repeatedly), we obtain for such y ′ , y ′′
ρ(h(y ′ ), h(y ′′ )) ≤ ρ(h(y ′ ), f (x′ , y ′ )) + ρ(f (x′ , y ′ ), g(x′ ))

+ ρ(g(x′ ), f (x′ , y ′′ )) + ρ(f (x′ , y ′′ ), h(y ′′ ))
ε ε ε ε
< + + + = ε.
4 4 4 4
It follows that the function h satisfies the Cauchy criterion of Theorem 2 in
§2. (It does apply since T is complete.) Thus limy→q h(y) exists, and, by
assumption (ii), it equals lim lim f (x, y) (which therefore exists).
y→q x→p

Let then H = lim h(y). With δ as above, fix some y0 ∈ G¬q (δ) so close to q
y→q
that
ε
ρ(h(y0 ), H) < .
4
Also, using assumption (ii), choose a δ ′ > 0 (δ ′ ≤ δ) such that
ε
for x ∈ G¬p (δ ′ ).
ρ(h(y0 ), f (x, y0 )) <
4
Combining with (5′ ), obtain (∀ x ∈ G¬p (δ ′ ))
ρ(H, g(x)) ≤ ρ(H, h(y0 )) + ρ(h(y0 ), f (x, y0 )) + ρ(f (x, y0 ), g(x)) <

3ε
. (6)
4

Thus
(∀ x ∈ G¬p (δ ′ ))

ρ(H, g(x)) < ε.

Hence limx→p g(x) = H, i.e., the second iterated limit, lim lim f (x, y), likewise
x→p y→q
exists and equals H.
Finally, with the same δ ′ ≤ δ, we combine (6) and (5′ ) to obtain
(∀ x ∈ G¬p (δ ′ )) (∀ y ∈ G¬q (δ ′ ))

ρ(H, f (x, y)) ≤ ρ(H, g(x)) + ρ(g(x), f (x, y)) <

3ε ε
+ = ε.

4

Hence the double limit (2) also exists and equals H. 
Note 2. The same proof works also with f restricted to (X −{p})×(Y −{q})
so that the “lines” x = p and y = q are excluded from Df . In this case,
formulas (2) and (3) mean the same; i.e.,
lim f (x, y) =

x→p
y→q

lim

(x, y)→(p, q)

f (x, y).

Note 3. In Theorem 2, we may take E ∗ (suitably metrized) for X or Y
or T . Then the theorem also applies to limits at ±∞, and infinite limits. We
may also take X = Y = N ∪ {+∞} (the naturals together with +∞), with the
same E ∗ -metric, and consider limits at p = q = +∞. Moreover, by Note 2, we
may restrict f to N × N , so that f : N × N → T becomes a double sequence

∗ §11.

223

Product Spaces. Double and Iterated Limits

(Chapter 1, §9). Writing m and n for x and y, and umn for f (x, y), we then
obtain Osgood’s theorem for double sequences (also called the Moore–Smith
theorem) as follows.
Theorem 2′ . Let {umn } be a double sequence in a complete space (T, ρ′ ). If
lim umn = qm exists for each m

n→∞

and if
lim umn = pn (uniformly in n) likewise exists,

m→∞

then the double limit and the two iterated limits of {umn } exist and
lim umn = lim lim umn = lim lim umn .

m→∞
n→∞

n→∞ m→∞

m→∞ n→∞

Here the assumption that limm→∞ umn = pn (uniformly in n) means, by
(5), that
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ n) (∀ m > k)

ρ(umn , pn ) < ε.

(7)

Similarly, the statement “m→∞
lim umn = s” (see (2)) is tantamount to
n→∞

(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m, n > k)

ρ(umn , s) < ε.

(8)

Note 4. Given any sequence {xm } ⊆ (S, ρ), we may consider the double
limit m→∞
lim ρ(xm , xn ) in E 1 . By using (8), one easily sees that
n→∞

lim ρ(xm , xn ) = 0

m→∞
n→∞

iff
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m, n > k)

ρ(xm , xn ) < ε,

i.e., iff {xm } is a Cauchy sequence. Thus Cauchy sequences are those for which
lim ρ(xm , xn ) = 0.

Theorem 3. In every metric space (S, ρ), the metric ρ : (S × S) → E 1 is a
continuous function on the product space S × S.
Proof. Fix any (p, q) ∈ S × S. By Theorem 1 of §2, ρ is continuous at (p, q)
iff
ρ(xm , ym ) → ρ(p, q) whenever (xm , ym ) → (p, q),
i.e., whenever xm → p and ym → q. However, this follows by Theorem 4 in
Chapter 3, §15. Thus continuity is proved. 

§12. Sequences and Series of Functions
I. Let
f1 , f2 , . . . , fm , . . .
be a sequence of mappings from a common domain A into a metric space
(T, ρ′ ).1 For each (fixed) x ∈ A, the function values
f1 (x), f2 (x), . . . , fm (x), . . .
form a sequence of points in the range space (T, ρ′ ). Suppose this sequence
converges for each x in a set B ⊆ A. Then we can define a function f : B → T
by setting
f (x) = lim fm (x) for all x ∈ B.
m→∞

This means that
(∀ ε > 0) (∀ x ∈ B) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

ρ′ (fm (x), f (x)) < ε.

(1)

Here k depends not only on ε but also on x, since each x yields a different
sequence {fm (x)}. However, in some cases (resembling uniform continuity), k
1

We briefly denote such a sequence by fm : A → (T, ρ′ ).

228

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

depends on ε only; i.e., given ε > 0, one and the same k fits all x in B. In
symbols, this is indicated by changing the order of quantifiers, namely,
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ x ∈ B) (∀ m > k)

ρ′ (fm (x), f (x)) < ε.

(2)

Of course, (2) implies (1), but the converse fails (see examples below). This
suggests the following definitions.
Definition 1.
With the above notation, we call f the pointwise limit of a sequence of
functions fm on a set B (B ⊆ A) iff
f (x) = lim fm (x) for all x in B;
m→∞

i.e., formula (1) holds. We then write
fm → f (pointwise) on B.
In case (2), we call the limit uniform (on B) and write
fm → f (uniformly) on B.
II. P
If the fm are real, complex, or vector valued (§3), we can also define
m
sm = k=1 fk (= sum of the first m functions) for each m, so
(∀ x ∈ A) (∀ m)

sm (x) =

m
X

fk (x).

k=1

The sm form a new sequence of functions on A. The pair of sequences
({fm }, {sm })
is called the (infinite) series with general term fmP
; sm isP
called its mth partial
sum. The series is often denoted by symbols like
fm ,
fm (x), etc.
Definition 2.

P
The series
fm on A is said to converge (pointwise or uniformly) to a
function f on a set B ⊆ A iff the sequence {sm } of its partial sums does
as well.
We then call f the sum of the series and write
f (x) =

m=1

(pointwise or uniformly) on B.
P
Note that series of constants,
cm , may be treated as series of constant
functions fm , with fm (x) = cm for x ∈ A.

229

§12. Sequences and Series of Functions

If the range space is E 1 or E ∗ , we also consider infinite limits,
lim fm (x) = ±∞.

m→∞

However, a series for which
∞
X

fm = lim sm

m=1

is infinite for some x is regarded as divergent (i.e., not convergent) at that x.
III. Since convergence of series reduces to that of sequences {sm }, we shall
first of all consider sequences. The following is a simple and useful test for
uniform convergence of sequences fm : A → (T, ρ′ ).

Theorem 1. Given a sequence of functions fm : A → (T, ρ′ ), let B ⊆ A and
Qm = sup ρ′ (fm (x), f (x)).
x∈B

Then fm → f (uniformly on B) iff Qm → 0.

Proof. If Qm → 0, then by definition

(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k) Qm < ε.
However, Qm is an upper bound of all distances ρ′ (fm (x), f (x)), x ∈ B. Hence
(2) follows.
Conversely, if
(∀ x ∈ B) ρ′ (fm (x), f (x)) < ε,
then
ε ≥ sup ρ′ (fm (x), f (x)),
x∈B

i.e., Qm ≤ ε. Thus (2) implies
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ m > k)

Qm ≤ ε

and Qm → 0. 
Examples.
(a) We have
lim xn = 0 if |x| < 1 and lim xn = 1 if x = 1.

n→∞

n→∞

Thus, setting fn (x) = xn , consider B = [0, 1] and C = [0, 1).
We have fn → 0 (pointwise) on C and fn → f (pointwise) on B, with
f (x) = 0 for x ∈ C and f (1) = 1. However, the limit is not uniform on

230

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

C, let alone on B. Indeed,
Qn = sup |fn (x) − f (x)| = 1 for each n.2
x∈C

Thus Qn does not tend to 0, and uniform convergence fails by Theorem 1.
(b) In Example (a), let D = [0, a], 0 < a < 1. Then fn → f (uniformly) on
D because, in this case,
Qn = sup |fn (x) − f (x)| = sup |xn − 0| = an → 0.
x∈D

x∈D

(c) Let
fn (x) = x2 +

sin nx
,
n

x ∈ E1.

For a fixed x,
lim fn (x) = x2

n→∞

since

Thus, setting f (x) = x2 , we have fn → f (pointwise) on E 1 . Also,

→ 0. By Theorem 1, the limit is uniform on all of

Note 1. Example (a) shows that the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions need not be continuous. Not so for uniform limits, as the
following theorem shows.
Theorem 2. Let fm : A → (T, ρ′ ) be a sequence of functions on A ⊆ (S, ρ). If
fm → f (uniformly) on a set B ⊆ A, and if the fm are relatively (or uniformly)
continuous on B, then the limit function f has the same property.
Proof. Fix ε > 0. As fm → f (uniformly) on B, there is a k such that
ε
(∀ x ∈ B) (∀ m ≥ k) ρ′ (fm (x), f (x)) < .

(3)

Take any fm with m > k, and take any p ∈ B. By continuity, there is δ > 0,
with
ε
(4)
(∀ x ∈ B ∩ Gp (δ)) ρ′ (fm (x), fm (p)) < .

Here
Qn = sup |xn − 0| = sup xn = lim xn = 1
x∈C

0≤x<1

x→1

by Theorem 1 of §5, because xn increases with x ր 1, i.e., each fn is a monotone function
on C. Note that all fn are continuous on B = [0, 1], but f = lim fn is discontinuous at 1.

231

§12. Sequences and Series of Functions

ε
Also, setting x = p in (3) gives ρ′ (fm (p), f (p)) < . Combining this with
4
(4) and (3), we obtain (∀ x ∈ B ∩ Gp (δ))
ρ′ (f (x), f (p)) ≤ ρ′ (f (x), fm (x)) + ρ′ (fm (x), fm (p)) + ρ′ (fm (p), f (p))
ε ε ε
< + + < ε.
4 4 4
We thus see that for p ∈ B,
ρ′ (f (x), f (p)) < ε,

(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x ∈ B ∩ Gp (δ))

i.e., f is relatively continuous at p (over B), as claimed.
Quite similarly, the reader will show that f is uniformly continuous if the
fn are. 
Note 2. A similar proof also shows that if fm → f (uniformly) on B, and
if the fm are relatively continuous at a point p ∈ B, so also is f .

Theorem 3 (Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence). Let (T, ρ′ ) be complete. Then a sequence fm : A → T , A ⊆ (S, ρ), converges uniformly on a set
B ⊆ A iff
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ k) (∀ x ∈ B) (∀ m, n > k)

ρ′ (fm (x), fn (x)) < ε.

(5)

Proof. If (5) holds then, for any (fixed) x ∈ B, {fm (x)} is a Cauchy sequence
of points in T , so by the assumed completeness of T , it has a limit f (x). Thus
we can define a function f : B → T with
f (x) = lim fm (x) on B.
m→∞

To show that fm → f (uniformly) on B, we use (5) again. Keeping ε, k,
x, and m temporarily fixed, we let n → ∞ so that fn (x) → f (x). Then by
Theorem 4 of Chapter 3, §15, ρ′ (fm (x), fn (x)) → p′ (f (x), fm (x)). Passing to
the limit in (5), we thus obtain (2).
The easy proof of the converse is left to the reader (cf. Chapter 3, §17,
Theorem 1). 
IV. If the range space (T, ρ′ ) is E 1 , C, or E n (∗ or another normed space),
the standard metric applies. In particular, for series we have
ρ′ (sm (x), sn (x)) = |sn (x) − sm (x)|

Chapter 4. Function Limits and Continuity

Replacing here m by m − 1 and applying Theorem 3 to the sequence {sm }, we
obtain the following result.
Theorem 3′ . Let the range space of fm , m = 1, 2,P
. . . , be E 1 , C, or E n (∗ or
another complete normed space). Then the series
fm converges uniformly
on B iff
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ q) (∀ n > m > q) (∀ x ∈ B)

fk (x) < ε.

Similarly, via {sm }, Theorem 2 extends to series of functions. (Observe that
the sm are continuous if the fm are.) Formulate it!
P∞
V. If m=1 fm exists on B, one may arbitrarily “group” the terms, i.e., replace every several consecutive terms by their sum. This property is stated
more precisely in the following theorem.
Theorem 4. Let
f=

∞
X

fm (pointwise) on B.3

m=1

Let m1 < m2 < · · · < mn < · · · in N , and define
g1 = sm1 , gn = smn − smn−1 ,

n > 1.

(Thus gn+1 = fmn +1 + · · · + fmn+1 .) Then
f=

∞
X

gn (pointwise) on B as well ;

n=1

similarly for uniform convergence.
Proof. Let
s′n

=

n
X

gk ,

n = 1, 2, . . . .

k=1

Then s′n = smn (verify!), so {s′n } is a subsequence, {smn }, of {sm }. Hence
sm → f (pointwise) implies s′n → f (pointwise); i.e.,
f=

∞
X

gn (pointwise).

n=1

For uniform convergence, see Problem 13 (cf. also Problem 19).

Here we allow also infinite values for f (x) if the fm are real .

§13. Absolutely Convergent Series. Power Series

P
P
Theorem 4 (necessary condition of convergence). If
fm or
|fm | converges on B (pointwise or uniformly), then |fm | → 0 on B (in the same sense).
Thus a series cannot converge unless its general term tends to 0 (respectively, 0̄).
P
Proof. If
fm = f , say, then sm → f and also sm−1 → f . Hence
sm − sm−1 → f − f = 0̄.

However, sm − sm−1 = fm . Thus fm → 0̄, and |fm | → 0, as claimed.
This holds for pointwise and uniform convergence alike (see Problem 14 in
§12). 
Caution: The condition |fm | → 0 is necessary but not sufficient. Indeed,
there are divergent series with general term tending to 0, as we show next.

that

As 0 < r < 1, the geometric series

If lim n |an | > 1, then by Corollary 2 of Chapter

Similarly, if

Hence whenever the ratio test indicates convergence or divergence, so certainly

where x, p, an ∈ E 1 (C); the an may also be vectors.
P
Theorem 6. For any power series
an (x − p)n , there is a unique r ∈ E ∗
(0 ≤ r ≤ +∞), called its convergence radius, such that the series converges

if |x − p| > r.8

is the required radius, and clearly there can be only one such r. (Why?) 

p

P
Proof. Suppose
|an (x0 − p)n | converges. Let
r=

δ = |x0 − p| and Mn = |an |δ n ;

P
thus
Mn converges.
Now if x ∈ Gp (δ), then |x − p| ≤ δ, so

Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

§1. Derivatives of Functions of One Real Variable
In this chapter, “E” will always denote any one of E 1 , E ∗ , C (the complex
field), E n , ∗ or another normed space. We shall consider functions f : E 1 → E
of one real variable with values in E. Functions f : E 1 → E ∗ (admitting finite
and infinite values) are said to be extended real . Thus f : E 1 → E may be real,
extended real, complex, or vector valued.
Operations in E ∗ were defined in Chapter 4, §4. Recall, in particular, our
conventions (2∗ ) there. Due to them, addition, subtraction, and multiplication
are always defined in E ∗ (with sums and products possibly “unorthodox”).
To simplify formulations, we shall also adopt the convention that
f (x) = 0 unless defined otherwise.
(“0” stands also for the zero-vector in E if E is a vector space.) Thus each
function f is defined on all of E 1 . For convenience, we call f (x) “finite” if
f (x) 6= ±∞ (also if it is a vector ).
Definition 1.
For each function f : E 1 → E, we define its derived function f ′ : E 1 → E
by setting, for every point p ∈ E 1 ,

 lim f (x) − f (p) if this limit exists (finite or not);
′
x→p
x−p
f (p) =
(1)

0, otherwise.

Thus f ′ (p) is always defined.
If the limit in (1) exists, we call it the derivative of f at p.
If, in addition, this limit is finite, we say that f is differentiable at p.
If this holds for each p in a set B ⊆ E 1 , we say that f has a derivative (respectively, is differentiable) on B, and we call the function f ′ the

252

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

derivative of f on B.1
If the limit in (1) is one sided (with x → p− or x → p+ ), we call it a
′
′
one-sided (left or right) derivative at p, denoted f−
or f+
.
Note that the formula f ′ (p) = 0 holds also if f has no derivative at p. On
the other hand, f ′ (p) 6= 0 implies that f ′ (p) is a genuine derivative.

Definition 2.

Given a function f : E 1 → E, we define its nth derived function (or derived
function of order n), denoted f (n) : E 1 → E, by induction:
f (0) = f, f (n+1) = [f (n) ]′ ,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Thus f (n+1) is the derived function of f (n) . By our conventions, f (n) is
defined on all of E 1 for each n and each function f : E 1 → E. We have
f (1) = f ′ , and we write f ′′ for f (2) , f ′′′ for f (3) , etc. We say that f has n
derivatives at a point p iff the limits
f (k) (x) − f (k) (q)
lim
x→q
x−q

exist for all q in a neighborhood Gp of p and for k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 2, and also
f (n−1) (x) − f (n−1) (p)
x→p
x−p
lim

exists. If all these limits are finite, we say that f is n times differentiable on
I; similarly for one-sided derivatives.
It is an important fact that differentiability implies continuity.
Theorem 1. If a function f : E 1 → E is differentiable at a point p ∈ E 1 , it is
continuous at p, and f (p) is finite (even if E = E ∗ ).
Proof. Setting ∆x = x − p and ∆f = f (x) − f (p), we have the identity
|f (x) − f (p)| =

∆f
· (x − p)
∆x

for x 6= p.

(2)

By assumption,
∆f
x→p ∆x

f ′ (p) = lim

exists and is finite. Thus as x → p, the right side of (2) (hence the left side as
well) tends to 0, so
lim |f (x) − f (p)| = 0, or lim f (x) = f (p),

x→p

x→p

If B is an interval , the derivative at its endpoints (if in B) need be one sided only, as
x → p over B (see next).

proving continuity at p.
Also, f (p) 6= ±∞, for otherwise |f (x) − f (p)| = +∞ for all x, and so
|f (x) − f (p)| cannot tend to 0. 
Note 1. Similarly, the existence of a finite left (right) derivative at p implies
left (right) continuity at p. The proof is the same.
Note 2. The existence of an infinite derivative does not imply continuity,
nor does it exclude it. For example, consider the two cases
1
(i) f (x) = , with f (0) = 0, and
x

(ii) f (x) = 3 x.
Give your comments for p = 0.
Caution: A function may be continuous on E 1 without being differentiable
anywhere (thus the converse to Theorem 1 fails). The first such function was
indicated by Weierstrass. We give an example due to Olmsted (Advanced
Calculus).
Examples.
(a) We first define a sequence of functions fn : E 1 → E 1 (n = 1, 2, . . . ) as
follows. For each k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , let
fn (x) = 0 if x = k · 4−n , and fn (x) =

1
2

· 4−n if x = (k + 12 ) · 4−n .

Between k · 4−n and (k ± 21 ) · 4−n , fn is linear (see Figure 21), so it is
P
continuous on E 1 . The series
fn converges uniformly on E 1 . (Verify!)
Let
∞
X
f=
fn .
n=1

Then f is continuous on E 1 (why?), yet it is nowhere differentiable.
To prove this fact, fix any p ∈ E 1 . For each n, let
xn = p + dn , where dn = ±4−n−1 ,

254

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

choosing the sign of dn so that p and xn are in the same half of a “sawtooth” in the graph of fn (Figure 21). Then
fn (xn ) − fn (p) = ±dn = ±(xn − p).

(Why?)

Also,
fm (xn ) − fm (p) = ±dn if m ≤ n
but vanishes for m > n. (Why?)
Thus, when computing f (xn ) − f (p), we may replace
f=

∞
X

fm by f =

m=1

n
X

m=1

Since
fm (xn ) − fm (p)
= ±1 for m ≤ n,
xn − p
the fraction
f (xn ) − f (p)
xn − p
is an integer , odd if n is odd and even if n is even. Thus this fraction
cannot tend to a finite limit as n → ∞, i.e., as dn = 4−n−1 → 0 and
xn = p + dn → p. A fortiori, this applies to
f (x) − f (p)
.
x→p
x−p
lim

Thus f is not differentiable at any p.
The expressions f (x)−f (p) and x−p, briefly denoted ∆f and ∆x, are called
the increments of f and x (at p), respectively.2 We now show that for differentiable functions, ∆f and ∆x are “nearly proportional” when x approaches
p; that is,
∆f
= c + δ(x)
∆x
with c constant and limx→p δ(x) = 0.
Theorem 2. A function f : E 1 → E is differentiable at p, and f ′ (p) = c, iff
there is a finite c ∈ E and a function δ : E 1 → E such that lim δ(x) = δ(p) = 0,
x→p
and such that
∆f = [c + δ(x)]∆x for all x ∈ E 1 .
(3)
2

This notation is rather incomplete but convenient. One only has to remember that both
∆f and ∆x depend on x and p.

255

§1. Derivatives of Functions of One Real Variable

Proof. If f is differentiable at p, put c = f ′ (p). Define δ(p) = 0 and
δ(x) =

∆f
− f ′ (p) for x 6= p.
∆x

Then limx→p δ(x) = f ′ (p) − f ′ (p) = 0 = δ(p). Also, (3) follows.
Conversely, if (3) holds, then
∆f
= c + δ(x) → c as x → p (since δ(x) → 0).
∆x
Thus by definition,
∆f
= f ′ (p) and f ′ (p) = c is finite.
x→p ∆x

c = lim



Theorem 3 (chain rule). Let the functions g : E 1 → E 1 (real ) and f : E 1 → E
(real or not) be differentiable at p and q, respectively, where q = g(p). Then
the composite function h = f ◦ g is differentiable at p, and
h′ (p) = f ′ (q)g ′ (p).

Proof. Setting
∆h = h(x) − h(p) = f (g(x)) − f (g(p)) = f (g(x)) − f (q),
we must show that

∆h
= f ′ (q)g ′ (p) 6= ±∞.
x→p ∆x
lim

Now as f is differentiable at q, Theorem 2 yields a function δ : E 1 → E such
that limx→q δ(x) = δ(q) = 0 and such that
(∀ y ∈ E 1 )

f (y) − f (q) = [f ′ (q) + δ(y)]∆y, ∆y = y − q.

Taking y = g(x), we get
(∀ x ∈ E 1 ) f (g(x)) − f (q) = [f ′ (q) + δ(g(x))][g(x) − g(p)],
where
g(x) − g(p) = y − q = ∆y and f (g(x)) − f (q) = ∆h,
as noted above. Hence
∆h
g(x) − g(p)
= [f ′ (q) + δ(g(x))] ·
∆x
x−p

for all x 6= p.

Let x → p. Then we obtain h′ (p) = f ′ (q)g ′ (p), for, by the continuity of δ ◦ g
at p (Chapter 4, §2, Theorem 3),
lim δ(g(x)) = δ(g(p)) = δ(q) = 0. 

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

The proofs of the next two theorems are left to the reader.
Theorem 4. If f , g, and h are real or complex and are differentiable at p, so
are
f
f ± g, hf , and
h
(the latter if h(p) 6= 0), and at the point p we have
(i) (f ± g)′ = f ′ ± g ′ ;

h
h2
All this holds also if f and g are vector valued and h is scalar valued. It also
applies to infinite (even one-sided ) derivatives, except when the limits involved
become indeterminate (Chapter 4, §4).
Note 3. By induction, if f , g, and h are
 n times differentiable at a point
n
p, so are f ± g and hf , and, denoting by k the binomial coefficients, we have
(i∗ ) (f ± g)(n) = f (n) ± g (n) ; and

Formula (ii ) is known as the Leibniz formula; its proof is analogous to that
of the binomial theorem. It is symbolically written as (hf )(n) = (h + f )n , with
the last term interpreted accordingly.3
Theorem 5 (componentwise differentiation). A function f : E 1 → E n (∗ C n )
is differentiable at p iff each of its n components (f1 , . . . , fn ) is, and then

(Chapter 4, §3, Note 5).
Examples (continued).
(b) Consider the complex exponential

f (x) = cos x + i · sin x = exi (Chapter 4, §3).
We assume the derivatives of cos x and sin x to be known (see Problem 8).
By Theorem 5, we have
1

f ′ (x) = − sin x + i · cos x = cos(x + 12 π) + i · sin(x + 12 π) = e(x+ 2 π)i .

In this connection, recall again the notation introduced in Chapter 4, §3 and also in
footnote 1 of Chapter 3, §9 and footnote 1 of Chapter 4, §13. We shall use it throughout.

Hence by induction,
1

f (n) (x) = e(x+ 2 nπ)i , n = 1, 2, . . . .
(c) Define f : E 1 → E 3 by
f (x) = (1, cos x, sin x),

(Verify!)

x ∈ E1.

Here Theorem 5 yields
f ′ (p) = (0, − sin p, cos p),

p ∈ E1.

For a fixed p = p0 , we may consider the line
x̄ = ā + t~u,
where
ā = f (p0 ) and ~u = f ′ (p0 ) = (0, − sin p0 , cos p0 ).
This is, by definition, the tangent vector at p0 to the curve f [E 1 ] in E 3 .
More generally, if f : E 1 → E is differentiable at p and continuous on some
globe about p, we define the tangent at p to the curve f [Gp ] (in E) to be the
line
x̄ = f (p) + t · f ′ (p);
f ′ (p) is its direction vector in E, while t is the variable real parameter. For real
functions f : E 1 → E 1 , we usually consider not f [E 1 ] but the curve y = f (x)
in E 2 , i.e., the set
{(x, y) | y = f (x), x ∈ E 1 }.
The tangent to that curve at p is the line through (p, f (p)) with slope f ′ (p).
In conclusion, let us note that differentiation (i.e., taking derivatives) is a
local limit process at some point p. Hence (cf. Chapter 4, §1, Note 4) the
existence and the value of f ′ (p) is not affected by restricting f to some globe
Gp about p or by arbitrarily redefining f outside Gp . For one-sided derivatives,
we may replace Gp by its corresponding “half.”

For a while (in §§2 and 3), we limit ourselves to extended-real functions. Below,

they are not constantly infinite on any interval (a, b), a < b.

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Lemma 1. If f ′ (p) > 0 at some p ∈ E 1 , then
x<p<y
implies
f (x) < f (p) < f (y)
for all x, y in a sufficiently small globe Gp (δ) = (p − δ, p + δ).1
Similarly, if f ′ (p) < 0, then x < p < y implies f (x) > f (p) > f (y) for x, y
in some Gp (δ).
Proof. If f ′ (p) > 0, the “0” case in Definition 1 of §1, is excluded, so
∆f
> 0.
x→p ∆x

f ′ (p) = lim

Hence we must also have ∆f /∆x > 0 for x in some Gp (δ).
It follows that ∆f and ∆x have the same sign in Gp (δ); i.e.,
f (x) − f (p) > 0 if x > p and f (x) − f (p) < 0 if x < p.
(This implies f (p) 6= ±∞. Why?) Hence
x < p < y =⇒ f (x) < f (p) < f (y),
as claimed; similarly in case f ′ (p) < 0. 
Corollary 1. If f (p) is the maximum or minimum value of f (x) for x in some
Gp (δ), then f ′ (p) = 0; i .e., f has a zero derivative, or none at all , at p.
For, by Lemma 1, f ′ (p) 6= 0 excludes a maximum or minimum at p. (Why?)

Note 1. Thus f ′ (p) = 0 is a necessary condition for a local maximum or
minimum at p. It is insufficient, however. For example, if f (x) = x3 , f has no
maxima or minima at all, yet f ′ (0) = 0. For sufficient conditions, see §6.
Figure 22 illustrates these facts at the points p2 , p3 , . . . , p11 . Note that in
Figure 22, the isolated points P, Q, R belong to the graph.
Geometrically, f ′ (p) = 0 means that the tangent at p is horizontal, or that
a two-sided tangent does not exist at p.
Theorem 1. Let f : E 1 → E ∗ be relatively continuous on an interval [a, b],
with f ′ 6= 0 on (a, b). Then f is strictly monotone on [a, b], and f ′ is signconstant there (possibly 0 at a and b), with f ′ ≥ 0 if f ↑, and f ′ ≤ 0 if f ↓.

Proof. By Theorem 2 of Chapter 4, §8, f attains a least value m, and a largest
value M , at some points of [a, b]. However, neither can occur at an interior
point p ∈ (a, b), for, by Corollary 1, this would imply f ′ (p) = 0, contrary to
our assumption.
1

This does not mean that f is monotone on any Gp (see Problem 6). We shall only say
in such cases that f increases at the point p.

Thus M = f (a) or M = f (b); for the moment we assume M = f (b) and
m = f (a). We must have m < M , for m = M would make f constant on [a, b],
implying f ′ = 0. Thus m = f (a) < f (b) = M .
Now let a ≤ x < y ≤ b. Applying the previous argument to each of the
intervals [a, x], [a, y], [x, y], and [x, b] (now using that m = f (a) < f (b) = M ),
we find that
f (a) ≤ f (x) < f (y) ≤ f (b).

(Why?)

Thus a ≤ x < y ≤ b implies f (x) < f (y); i.e., f increases on [a, b]. Hence
f ′ cannot be negative at any p ∈ [a, b], for, otherwise, by Lemma 1, f would
decrease at p. Thus f ′ ≥ 0 on [a, b].
In the case M = f (a) > f (b) = m, we would obtain f ′ ≤ 0. 
Caution: The function f may increase or decrease at p even if f ′ (p) = 0.
See Note 1.
Corollary 2 (Rolle’s theorem). If f : E 1 → E ∗ is relatively continuous on
[a, b] and if f (a) = f (b), then f ′ (p) = 0 for at least one interior point p ∈ (a, b).
For, if f ′ 6= 0 on all of (a, b), then by Theorem 1, f would be strictly
monotone on [a, b], so the equality f (a) = f (b) would be impossible.
Figure 22 illustrates this on the intervals [p2 , p4 ] and [p4 , p6 ], with f ′ (p3 ) =
′
f (p5 ) = 0. A discontinuity at 0 causes an apparent failure on [0, p2 ].

Note 2. Theorem 1 and Corollary 2 hold even if f (a) and f (b) are infinite, if
continuity is interpreted in the sense of the metric ρ′ of Problem 5 in Chapter 3,
§11. (Weierstrass’ Theorem 2 of Chapter 4, §8 applies to (E ∗ , ρ′ ), with the
same proof.)
Theorem 2 (Cauchy’s law of the mean). Let the functions f, g : E 1 → E ∗ be
relatively continuous and finite on [a, b] and have derivatives on (a, b), with f ′
and g ′ never both infinite at the same point p ∈ (a, b). Then
g ′ (q)[f (b) − f (a)] = f ′ (q)[g(b) − g(a)] for at least one q ∈ (a, b).

Bf ′ (q) for some q ∈ (a, b). For this purpose, consider the function h = Ag−Bf .
It is relatively continuous and finite on [a, b], as are g and f . Also,
h(a) = f (b)g(a) − g(b)f (a) = h(b).

(Verify!)

Thus by Corollary 2, h′ (q) = 0 for some q ∈ (a, b). Here, by Theorem 4 of
§1, h′ = (Ag − Bf )′ = Ag ′ − Bf ′ . (This is legitimate, for, by assumption, f ′
and g ′ never both become infinite, so no indeterminate limits occur.) Thus
h′ (q) = Ag ′ (q) − Bf ′ (q) = 0, and (1) follows. 
Corollary 3 (Lagrange’s law of the mean). If f : E 1 → E 1 is relatively continuous on [a, b] with a derivative on (a, b), then
f (b) − f (a) = f ′ (q)(b − a) for at least one q ∈ (a, b).
Proof. Take g(x) = x in Theorem 2, so g ′ = 1 on E 1 .

(2)



Note 3. Geometrically,
f (b) − f (a)
b−a

is the slope of the secant through
(a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)), and f ′ (q) is
the slope of the tangent line at q.
Thus Corollary 3 states that the secant is parallel to the tangent at some
intermediate point q; see Figure 23.
Theorem 2 states the same for curves
given parametrically: x = f (t), y = g(t).

Corollary 4. Let f be as in Corollary 3. Then
(i) f is constant on [a, b] iff f ′ = 0 on (a, b);
(ii) f ↑ on [a, b] iff f ′ ≥ 0 on (a, b); and

(iii) f ↓ on [a, b] iff f ′ ≤ 0 on (a, b).

Proof. Let f ′ = 0 on (a, b). If a ≤ x ≤ y ≤ b, apply Corollary 3 to the interval
[x, y] to obtain
f (y) − f (x) = f ′ (q)(y − x) for some q ∈ (a, b) and f ′ (q) = 0.
Thus f (y) − f (x) = 0 for x, y ∈ [a, b], so f is constant.
The rest is left to the reader. 

§2. Derivatives of Extended-Real Functions

Theorem 3 (inverse functions). Let f : E 1 → E 1 be relatively continuous and
strictly monotone on an interval I ⊆ E 1 . Let f ′ (p) 6= 0 at some interior
point p ∈ I. Then the inverse function g = f −1 (with f restricted to I) has a
derivative at q = f (p), and
1
g ′ (q) = ′ .
f (p)
(If f ′ (p) = ±∞, then g ′ (q) = 0.)

Proof. By Theorem 3 of Chapter 4, §9, g = f −1 is strictly monotone and
relatively continuous on f [I], itself an interval. If p is interior to I, then q = f (p)
is interior to f [I]. (Why?)
Now if y ∈ f [I], we set
∆g = g(y) − g(q), ∆y = y − q, x = f −1 (y) = g(y), and f (x) = y
and obtain
∆g
g(y) − g(q)

Now if y → q, the continuity of g at q yields g(y) → g(q); i.e., x → p. Also,
x 6= p iff y 6= q, for f and g are one-to-one functions. Thus we may substitute
y = f (x) or x = g(y) to get
g ′ (q) = lim

Let p > 0. Then (∀ x > 0)

More precisely, we are replacing the x by g(y) in (x − p)/[f (x) − f (p)] by Corollary 2 of
Chapter 4, §2 to obtain g ′ (q). The steps in (2′ ) should be reversed.

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Now let z = ∆x/p. (Why is this substitution admissible?) Then using
the formula
lim (1 + z)1/z = e

z→0

(see Chapter 4, §2, Example (C))

and the continuity of the log and power functions, we obtain
∆f

f ′ (p) = lim

The same formula results also if p < 0, i.e., |p| = −p. At p = 0, f has
one-sided derivatives (±∞) only (verify!), so f ′ (0) = 0 by Definition 1
in §1.

(B) The inverse of the loga function is the exponential g : E 1 → E 1 , with
g(y) = ay

(a > 0, a 6= 1).

By Theorem 3, we have
(∀ q ∈ E 1 )
Thus

§2. Derivatives of Extended-Real Functions

Theorem 4 (Darboux). If f : E 1 → E ∗ is relatively continuous and has a
derivative on an interval I, then f ′ has the Darboux property (Chapter 4, §9)
on I.
Proof. Let p, q ∈ I and f ′ (p) < c < f ′ (q). Put g(x) = f (x) − cx. Assume
g ′ 6= 0 on (p, q) and find a contradiction to Theorem 1. Details are left to the
reader. 

Problems on Derivatives of Extended-Real Functions
1. Complete the missing details in the proof of Theorems 1, 2, and 4,
Corollary 4, and Lemma 1.
[Hint for converse to Corollary 4(ii): Use Lemma 1 for an indirect proof.]

2. Do cases p ≤ 0 in Example (A).

3. Show that Theorems 1, 2, and 4 and Corollaries 2 to 4 hold also if f
is discontinuous at a and b but f (a+ ) and f (b− ) exist and are finite.
(In Corollary 2, assume also f (a+ ) = f (b− ); in Theorems 1 and 4 and
Corollary 2, finiteness is unnecessary.)
[Hint: Redefine f (a) and f (b).]

4. Under the assumptions of Corollary 3, show that f ′ cannot stay infinite
on any interval (p, q), a ≤ p < q ≤ b.
[Hint: Apply Corollary 3 to the interval [p, q].]

5. Justify footnote 1.
[Hint: Let

At 0, find f ′ from Definition 1 in §1. Use also Problem 8 of §1. Show that f is not
monotone on any G0 (δ).]

6. Show that f ′ need not be continuous or bounded on [a, b] (under the
standard metric), even if f is differentiable there.
[Hint: Take f as in Problem 5.]

7. With f as in Corollaries 3 and 4, prove that if f ′ ≥ 0 (f ′ ≤ 0) on (a, b)
and if f ′ is not constantly 0 on any subinterval (p, q) 6= ∅, then f is
strictly monotone on [a, b].
8. Let x = f (t), y = g(t), where t varies over an open interval I ⊆ E 1 , define a curve in E 2 parametrically. Prove that if f and g have derivatives
on I and f ′ 6= 0, then the function h = f −1 has a derivative on f [I],
and the slope of the tangent to the curve at t0 equals g ′ (t0 )/f ′ (t0 ).
[Hint: The word “curve” implies that f and g are continuous on I (Chapter 4, §10),
so Theorems 1 and 3 apply, and h = f −1 is a function. Also, y = g(h(x)). Use
Theorem 3 of §1.]

9. Prove that if f is continuous and has a derivative on (a, b) and if f ′
has a finite or infinite (even one-sided) limit at some p ∈ (a, b), then

266

this limit equals f ′ (p). Deduce that f ′ is continuous at p if f ′ (p− ) and
f ′ (p+ ) exist.

§3. L’Hôpital’s Rule
We shall now prove a useful rule for resolving indeterminate limits. Below, G¬p
denotes a deleted globe G¬p (δ) in E 1 , or one about ±∞ of the form (a, +∞)
or (−∞, a). For one-sided limits, replace G¬p by its appropriate “half.”
Theorem 1 (L’Hôpital’s rule). Let f, g : E 1 → E ∗ be differentiable on G¬p ,
with g ′ 6= 0 there. If |f (x)| and |g(x)| tend both to +∞,1 or both to 0, as x → p
and if
f ′ (x)
lim ′
= r exists in E ∗ ,
x→p g (x)
then also
lim

x→p

f (x)
= r;
g(x)

similarly for x → p+ or x → p− .

Proof. It suffices to consider left and right limits. Both combined then yield
the two-sided limit.
First, let −∞ ≤ p < +∞,
lim |f (x)| = lim |g(x)| = +∞ and lim

x→p+

x→p+

x→p+

This includes the cases f (x) → ±∞ and g(x) → ±∞.

§3. L’Hôpital’s Rule

Then given ε > 0, we can fix a > p (a ∈ G¬p ) such that
f ′ (x)
− r < ε, for all x in the interval (p, a).
g ′ (x)

(1)

Now apply Cauchy’s law of the mean (§2, Theorem 2) to each interval [x, a],
p < x < a. This yields, for each such x, some q ∈ (x, a) with
g ′ (q)[f (x) − f (a)] = f ′ (q)[g(x) − g(a)].
As g ′ 6= 0 (by assumption), g(x) 6= g(a) by Theorem 1, §2, so we may divide
to obtain
f ′ (q)
f (x) − f (a)
= ′ , where p < x < q < a.
g(x) − g(a)
g (q)
This combined with (1) yields
f (x) − f (a)
− r < ε,
g(x) − g(a)
or, setting
F (x) =

1 − f (a)/f (x)
,
1 − g(a)/g(x)

we have
f (x)
· F (x) − r < ε for all x inside (p, a).
g(x)

(2)

As |f (x)| and |g(x)| → +∞ (by assumption), we have F (x) → 1 as x → p+ .
Hence by rules for right limits, there is b ∈ (p, a) such that for all x ∈ (p, b),
both |F (x) − 1| < ε and F (x) > 12 . (Why?) For such x, formula (2) holds as
well. Also,
1
< 2 and |r − rF (x)| = |r| |1 − F (x)| < |r| ε.
|F (x)|
Combining this with (2), we have for x ∈ (p, b)
f (x)
f (x)
1
−r =
F (x) − rF (x)
g(x)
|F (x)| g(x)
f (x)
· F (x) − r + r − rF (x)
<2
g(x)
< 2ε(1 + |r|).
Thus, given ε > 0, we found b > p such that
f (x)
− r < 2ε(1 + |r|),
g(x)

x ∈ (p, b).

268

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

f (x)
= r, as claimed.
g(x)
The case limx→p+ f (x) = limx→p+ g(x) = 0 is simpler. As before, we obtain

As ε is arbitrary, we have lim

x→p+

f (x) − f (a)
− r < ε.
g(x) − g(a)

Here we may as well replace “a” by any y ∈ (p, a). Keeping y fixed, let x → p+ .
Then f (x) → 0 and g(x) → 0, so we get
f (y)
− r ≤ ε for any y ∈ (p, a).
g(y)
f (y)
= r. Thus the case x → p+ is settled
As ε is arbitrary, this implies lim
+
y→p g(y)
for a finite r.
The cases r = ±∞ and x → p− are analogous, and we leave them to the
reader. 

Elementary differentiation formulas are assumed known.

assumption may be replaced by continuity plus existence of finite or
infinite (but not both together infinite) derivatives f ′ and g ′ on G¬p

§4. Complex and Vector-Valued Functions on E 1
The theorems of §§2–3 fail for complex and vector-valued functions (see Problem 3 below and Problem 2 in §3). However, some analogues hold. In a sense,
they even are stronger, for, unlike the previous theorems, they do not require
the existence of a derivative on an entire interval I ⊆ E 1 , but only on I − Q,
where Q is a countable set, i.e., one contained in the range of a sequence,
Q ⊆ {pm }. (We henceforth presuppose §9 of Chapter 1.)
In the following theorem, due to N. Bourbaki,1 g : E 1 → E ∗ is extended real
while f may also be complex or vector valued. We call it the finite increments
law since it deals with “finite increments” f (b)−f (a) and g(b)−g(a). Roughly,
it states that |f ′ | ≤ g ′ implies a similar inequality for increments.
Theorem 1 (finite increments law). Let f : E 1 → E and g : E 1 → E ∗ be
relatively continuous and finite on a closed interval I = [a, b] ⊆ E 1 , and have
derivatives 2 with |f ′ | ≤ g ′ , on I − Q where Q ⊆ {p1 , p2 , . . . , pm , . . . }. Then
|f (b) − f (a)| ≤ g(b) − g(a).

(1)

This is the pen name of a famous school of twentieth-century mathematicians.
Actually, right derivatives suffice, as will follow from the proof. (Left derivatives suffice
as well.)

272

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

The proof is somewhat laborious, but worthwhile. (At a first reading, one
may omit it, however.) We outline some preliminary ideas.
Given any x ∈ I, suppose first that x > pm for at least one pm ∈ Q. In this
case, we put
X
Q(x) =
2−m ;
pm <x

here the summation is only over those m for which pm < x. If, however, there
are no pm ∈ Q with pm < x, we put Q(x) = 0. Thus Q(x) is defined for
all x ∈ I. It gives an idea as to “how many” pm (at which f may have no
derivative) precede x. Note that x < y implies Q(x) ≤ Q(y). (Why?) Also,
Q(x) ≤

∞
X

2−m = 1.

m=1

Our plan is as follows. To prove (1), it suffices to show that for some fixed
K ∈ E 1 , we have
(∀ ε > 0)

|f (b) − f (a)| ≤ g(b) − g(a) + Kε,

for then, letting ε → 0, we obtain (1). We choose
K = b − a + Q(b), with Q(x) as above.
Temporarily fixing ε > 0, let us call a point r ∈ I “good” iff
|f (r) − f (a)| ≤ g(r) − g(a) + [r − a + Q(r)]ε

(2)

and “bad” otherwise. We shall show that b is “good.” First, we prove a lemma.
Lemma 1. Every “good ” point r ∈ I (r < b) is followed by a whole interval
(r, s), r < s ≤ b, consisting of “good ” points only.

Proof. First let r ∈
/ Q, so by assumption, f and g have derivatives at r, with
|f ′ (r)| ≤ g ′ (r).
Suppose g ′ (r) < +∞. Then (treating g ′ as a right derivative) we can find s > r
(s ≤ b) such that, for all x in the interval (r, s),
g(x) − g(r)
ε
− g ′ (r) <
x−r
2

(why?);

similarly for f . Multiplying by x − r, we get

ε
and
2
ε
|g(x) − g(r) − g ′ (r)(x − r)| < (x − r) ,

|f (x) − f (r) − f ′ (r)(x − r)| < (x − r)

and hence by the triangle inequality (explain!),

and
g ′ (r)(x − r) + (x − r)

ε
< g(x) − g(r) + (x − r)ε.
2

Combining this with |f ′ (r)| ≤ g ′ (r), we obtain
|f (x) − f (r)| ≤ g(x) − g(r) + (x − r)ε whenever r < x < s.

(3)

Now as r is “good,” it satisfies (2); hence, certainly, as Q(r) ≤ Q(x),
|f (r) − f (a)| ≤ g(r) − g(a) + (r − a)ε + Q(x)ε whenever r < x < s.
Adding this to (3) and using the triangle inequality again, we have
|f (x) − f (a)| ≤ g(x) − g(a) + [x − a + Q(x)]ε for all x ∈ (r, s).
By definition, this shows that each x ∈ (r, s) is “good,” as claimed. Thus
the lemma is proved for the case r ∈ I − Q, with g ′ (r) < +∞.
The cases g ′ (r) = +∞ and r ∈ Q are left as Problems 1 and 2. 
We now return to Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 1. Seeking a contradiction, suppose b is “bad,” and let
B 6= ∅ be the set of all “bad” points in [a, b]. Let
r = inf B,

r ∈ [a, b].

Then the interval [a, r) can contain only “good” points, i.e., points x such that
|f (x) − f (a)| ≤ g(x) − g(a) + [x − a + Q(x)]ε.
As x < r implies Q(x) ≤ Q(r), we have
|f (x) − f (a)| ≤ g(x) − g(a) + [x − a + Q(r)]ε for all x ∈ [a, r).

(4)

Note that [a, r) 6= ∅, for by (2), a is certainly “good” (why?), and so
Lemma 1 yields a whole interval [a, s) of “good” points contained in [a, r).
Letting x → r in (4) and using the continuity of f at r, we obtain (2). Thus
r is “good” itself. Then, however, Lemma 1 yields a new interval (r, q) of
“good” points. Hence [a, q) has no “bad” points, and so q is a lower bound of
the set B of “bad ” points in I, contrary to q > r = glb B. This contradiction
shows that b must be “good,” i.e.,
|f (b) − f (a)| ≤ g(b) − g(a) + [b − a + Q(b)]ε.
Now, letting ε → 0, we obtain formula (1), and all is proved. 

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Corollary 1. If f : E 1 → E is relatively continuous and finite on I = [a, b] ⊆
E 1 , and has a derivative on I − Q, then there is a real M such that
|f (b) − f (a)| ≤ M (b − a) and M ≤ sup |f ′ (t)|.

(5)

t∈I−Q

Proof. Let
M0 = sup |f ′ (t)|.
t∈I−Q

If M0 < +∞, put M = M0 ≥ |f ′ | on I − Q, and take g(x) = M x in Theorem 1.
Then g ′ = M ≥ |f ′ | on I − Q, so formula (1) yields (5) since
g(b) − g(a) = M b − M a = M (b − a).
If, however, M0 = +∞, let
M=

f (b) − f (a)
< M0 .
b−a

Then (5) clearly is true. Thus the required M exists always.3



Corollary 2. Let f be as in Corollary 1. Then f is constant on I iff f ′ = 0
on I − Q.

Proof. If f ′ = 0 on I − Q, then M = 0 in Corollary 1, so Corollary 1 yields,
for any subinterval [a, x] (x ∈ I), |f (x) − f (a)| ≤ 0; i.e., f (x) = f (a) for all
x ∈ I. Thus f is constant on I.
Conversely, if so, then f ′ = 0, even on all of I. 
Corollary 3. Let f, g : E 1 → E be relatively continuous and finite on I =
[a, b], and differentiable on I − Q. Then f − g is constant on I iff f ′ = g ′ on
I − Q.

Proof. Apply Corollary 2 to the function f − g.



We can now also strengthen parts (ii) and (iii) of Corollary 4 in §2.

Theorem 2. Let f be real and have the properties stated in Corollary 1. Then
(i) f ↑ on I = [a, b] iff f ′ ≥ 0 on I − Q; and

(ii) f ↓ on I iff f ′ ≤ 0 on I − Q.

Proof. Let f ′ ≥ 0 on I − Q. Fix any x, y ∈ I (x < y) and define g(t) = 0 on
E 1 . Then |g ′ | = 0 ≤ f ′ on I − Q. Thus g and f satisfy Theorem 1 (with their
roles reversed ) on I, and certainly on the subinterval [x, y]. Thus we have
f (y) − f (x) ≥ |g(y) − g(x)| = 0, i.e., f (y) ≥ f (x) whenever y > x in I,
so f ↑ on I.
3

Note that M as defined here depends on a and b. So does M0 .

§4. Complex and Vector-Valued Functions on E 1

Conversely, if f ↑ on I, then for every p ∈ I, we must have f ′ (p) ≥ 0, for
otherwise, by Lemma 1 of §2, f would decrease at p. Thus f ′ ≥ 0, even on all
of I, and (i) is proved. Assertion (ii) is proved similarly. 

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

§5. Antiderivatives (Primitives, Integrals)
Given f : E 1 → E, we often have to find a function F such that F ′ = f on I,
or at least on I − Q.1 We also require F to be relatively continuous and finite
on I. This process is called antidifferentiation or integration.
Definition 1.
We call F : E 1 → E a primitive, or antiderivative, or an indefinite integral , of f on I iff
(i) F is relatively continuous and finite on I, and
(ii) F is differentiable, with F ′ = f , on I − Q at least.

We then write

F =

Z

f, or F (x) =

Z

f (x) dx, on I.

(The latter is classical notation.)
R If such an F exists (which is not always the case), we shall say that
f exists on I, or that f has a primitive (or antiderivative) on I, or that
f is primitively integrable (briefly integrable) on I.
R
If F ′ = f on a set B ⊆ I, we say that
f is exact on B and call F an
R
exact primitive on B. Thus if Q = ∅, f is exact on all of I.

Note 1. Clearly, if F ′ =R f , then also (F + c)′ = f for a finite constant
c. Thus the notation F = f is rather incomplete; it means that F is one
of
R many primitives. We now show that all of them have the form F + c (or
f + c).
Theorem 1. If F and G are primitive to f on I, then G − F is constant on I.

Proof. By assumption, F and G are relatively continuous and finite on I;
hence so is G − F . Also, F ′ = f on I − Q and G′ = f on I − P . (Q and P are
countable, but possibly Q 6= P .)
Hence both F ′ and G′ equal f on I − S, where S = P ∪ Q, and S is countable
itself by Theorem 2 of Chapter 1, §9.
Thus by Corollary 3 in §4, F ′ = G′ on I − S implies G − F = c (constant)
on each [x, y] ⊆ I; hence G − F = c (or G = F + c) on I. 
Definition 2.
R
If F = f on I and if a, b ∈ I (where a ≤ b or b ≤ a), we define
Z b
Z b
b
f (x) dx = F (b) − F (a), also written F (x) .

In this section, Q, P , and S shall denote countable sets, F ′ , G′ , and H ′ are finite

§5. Antiderivatives (Primitives, Integrals)

This expression is called the definite integral of f from a to b.2
The definite integral of f from a to b is independent of the particular choice
of the primitive F for f , and thus unambiguous, for if G is another primitive,
Theorem 1 yields G = F + c, so
G(b) − G(a) = F (b) + c − [F (a) + c] = F (b) − F (a),
and it does not matter whether we take F or G.
Rb

Note that a f (x) dx, or a f , is a constant in the range space E (a vector

if f is vector valued). The “x” in a f (x) dx is a “dummy variable” only, and
it may be replaced by any other letter. Thus
Z b
Z b
f (x) dx =
f (y) dy = F (b) − F (a).

On the other hand, the indefinite integral is a function: F : E 1 → E.

Note 2. We may, however, vary a or b (or both) in (1). Thus, keeping a
fixed and varying b, we can define a function
Z t
G(t) =
f = F (t) − F (a), t ∈ I.

R
Then G = F = f on I, and G(a) = F (a) − F (a) = 0. Thus if f exists
on I, f has a (unique) primitive G on I such that G(a) = 0. (It is unique by
Theorem 1. Why?)
Examples.
(a) Let

and F (x) = ln |x|, with F (0) = f (0) = 0.

R
Then F ′ = f and F = f on (−∞, 0) and on (0, +∞) but not on E 1 ,

Caution: Corollary 9 may fail if f is inexact at some p ∈ (a, b). (Exactness

R2
Thus in Example (b) above, −2 f = 0. Yet for no q is f (q)(2 + 2) = 0, since

f (q) = ±1. The reason is that f is inexact just at 0, an interior point of

§6. Differentials. Taylor’s Theorem and Taylor’s Series
Recall (Theorem 2 of §1) that a function f is differentiable at p iff
∆f = f ′ (p)∆x + δ(x)∆x,
with limx→p δ(x) = δ(p) = 0. It is customary to write df for f ′ (p)∆x and
o(∆x) for δ(x)∆x;1 df is called the differential of f (at p and x). Thus
∆f = df + o(∆x);
i.e., df approximates ∆f to within o(∆x).
More generally, given any function f : E 1 → E and p, x ∈ E 1 , we define
dn f = dn f (p, x) = f (n) (p)(x − p)n ,
1

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(1)

This is the so-called “little o” notation. Given g : E 1 → E 1 , we write o(g(x)) for any
expression of the form δ(x)g(x), with δ(x) → 0. In our case, g(x) = ∆x.

289

§6. Differentials. Taylor’s Theorem and Taylor’s Series

where f (n) is the nth derived function (Definition 2 in §1); dn f is called the
nth differential , or differential of order n, of f (at p and x). In particular,
d1 f = f ′ (p)∆x = df .2 By our conventions, dn f is always defined, as is f (n) .
As we shall see, good approximations of ∆f (suggested by Taylor) can often
be obtained by using higher differentials (1), as follows:
∆f = df +

Formula (3) is known as the nth Taylor expansion of f about p (with remainder term Rn to be estimated). Usually we treat p as fixed and x as variable.

X
f (k) (p)

k=0

k!

(x − p)k ,

we have
f (x) = Pn (x) + Rn (x).
The function Pn : E 1 → E so defined is called the nth Taylor polynomial for
f about p. Thus (3) yields approximations of f by polynomials Pn , n =
1, 2, 3, . . . . This is one way of interpreting it. The other (easy to remember) one is (2), which gives approximations of ∆f by the dk f . It remains,
however, to find a good estimate for Rn . We do it next.
Theorem 1 (Taylor). Let the function f : E 1 → E and its first n derived
functions be relatively continuous and finite on an interval I and differentiable
on I − Q (Q countable). Let p, x ∈ I. Then formulas (2) and (3) hold , with

We use the right side as a “pattern” to define a function h : E 1 → E. This

set
h(t) = f (a) − f (t) −

f ′ (t)

Then h(p) = Rn and h(a) = 0. Our assumptions imply that h is relatively

Hence, applying Theorem 1 in §4 to the functions h and g on the interval [a, p]

|Rn − 0| ≤ M

For real functions, we obtain some additional estimates of Rn .
Theorem 1′ . If f is real and n + 1 times differentiable on I, then for p 6= x
(p, x ∈ I), there are qn , qn′ in the interval (p, x) (respectively, (x, p)) such that

(Formulas (5′ ) and (5′′ ) are known as the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of
Rn , respectively.)
Proof. Exactly as in the proof of Theorem 1, we obtain the function h and
formula (5). By our present assumptions, h is differentiable (hence continuous)
on I, so we may apply to it Cauchy’s law of the mean (Theorem 2 of §2) on
the interval [a, p] (or [p, a] if p < a), where a = x ∈ I.
For this purpose, we shall associate h with another suitable function g (to
be specified later). Then by Theorem 2 of §2, there is a real q ∈ (a, p) (respectively, q ∈ (p, a)) such that
g ′ (q)[h(a) − h(p)] = h′ (q)[g(a) − g(p)].

Here by the previous proof, h(a) = 0, h(p) = Rn , and
f (n+1)

Thus
g ′ (q) · Rn =

(6)

Now define g by
g(t) = a − t,

t ∈ E1.

Then
g(a) − g(p) = −(a − p) and g ′ (q) = −1,

so (6) yields (5′′ ) (with qn′ = q and a = x).
Similarly, setting g(t) = (a − t)n+1 , we obtain (5′ ). (Verify!) Thus all is
proved. 

292

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Note 1. In (5′ ) and (5′′ ), the numbers qn and qn′ depend on n and are
different in general (qn 6= qn′ ), for they depend on the choice of the function g.
Since they are between p and x, they may be written as
qn = p + θn (x − p) and qn′ = p + θn′ (x − p),
where 0 < θn < 1 and 0 < θn′ < 1. (Explain!)
Note 2. For any function f : E 1 → E, the Taylor polynomials Pn are partial
sums of a power series, called the Taylor series for f (about p). We say that f
admits such a series on a set B iff the series converges to f on B; i.e.,
f (x) = lim Pn (x) =
n→∞

f (n) (p)
(x − p)n 6= ±∞ for x ∈ B.

(7)

This is clearly the case iff
lim Rn (x) = lim [f (x) − Pn (x)] = 0 for x ∈ B;

n→∞

n→∞

briefly, Rn → 0. Thus
f admits a Taylor series (about p) iff Rn → 0.
Caution: The convergence of the series alone (be it pointwise or uniform)
does not suffice. Sometimes the series converges to a sum other than f (x); then
(7) fails. Thus all depends on the necessary and sufficient condition: Rn → 0.
Before giving examples, we introduce a convenient notation.
Definition 1.
We say that f is of class CDn , or continuously differentiable n times, on a
set B iff f is n times differentiable on B, and f (n) is relatively continuous
on B. Notation: f ∈ CDn (on B).
If this holds for each n ∈ N , we say that f is infinitely differentiable
on B and write f ∈ CD∞ (on B).
The notation f ∈ CD0 means that f is finite and relatively continuous
(all on B).
Examples.
(a) Let
f (x) = ex on E 1 .
Then
(∀ n) f (n) (x) = ex ,
so f ∈ CD∞ on E 1 . At p = 0, f (n) (p) = 1, so we obtain by Theorem 1′

(b) Let
2

f (x) = e−1/x with f (0) = 0.
As limx→0 f (x) = 0 = f (0), f is continuous at 0.3 We now show that
f ∈ CD∞ on E 1 .
For x 6= 0, this is clear; moreover, induction yields
2

f (n) (x) = e−1/x x−3n Sn (x),
where Sn is a polynomial in x of degree 2(n − 1) (this is all we need know
about Sn ). A repeated application of L’Hôpital’s rule then shows that
lim f (n) (x) = 0 for each n.

x→0

To find f ′ (0), we have to use the definition of a derivative:
f (x) − f (0)
,
x→0

f ′ (0) = lim

At other points, f is continuous by the continuity of exponentials.

294

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

or by L’Hôpital’s rule,
f ′ (x)
= 0.
x→0
1

f ′ (0) = lim
Using induction again, we get
f (n) (0) = 0,

n = 1, 2, . . . .

Thus, indeed, f has finite derivatives of all orders at each x ∈ E 1 , including x = 0, so f ∈ CD∞ on E 1 , as claimed.
Nevertheless, any attempt to use formula (3) at p = 0 yields nothing.
As all f (n) vanish at 0, so do all terms except Rn . Thus no approximation
2
by polynomials results—we only get Pn = 0 on E 1 and Rn (x) = e−1/x .
Rn does not tend to 0 except at x = 0, so f admits no Taylor series about
0 (except on E = {0}).4
Taylor’s theorem also yields sufficient conditions for maxima and minima,
as we see in the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Let f : E 1 → E ∗ be of class CDn on Gp (δ) for an even number
n ≥ 2, and let
f (k) (p) = 0 for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1,
while
f (n) (p) < 0 (respectively, f (n) (p) > 0).
Then f (p) is the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of f on some Gp (ε),
ε ≤ δ.
If , however , these conditions hold for some odd n ≥ 1 (i .e., the first nonvanishing derivative at p is of odd order ), f has no maximum or minimum
at p.
Proof. As
f (k) (p) = 0,

k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1,

Theorem 1′ (with n replaced by n − 1) yields
f (x) = f (p) + f (n) (qn )

(x − p)n
n!

for all x ∈ Gp (δ),

with qn between x and p.
Also, as f ∈ CDn , f (n) is continuous at p. Thus if f (n) (p) < 0, then f (n) < 0
on some Gp (ε), 0 < ε ≤ δ. However, x ∈ Gp (ε) implies qn ∈ Gp (ε), so
f (n) (qn ) < 0,
4

Taylor’s series with p = 0 is often called the Maclaurin series (though without proper
justification). As we see, it may fail even if f ∈ CD∞ near 0.

§6. Differentials. Taylor’s Theorem and Taylor’s Series

295

while
(x − p)n ≥ 0 if n is even.
It follows that
f (n) (qn )

(x − p)n
≤ 0,
n!

and so

(x − p)n
≤ f (p) for x ∈ Gp (ε),
n!
i.e., f (p) is the maximum value of f on Gp (ε), as claimed.
Similarly, in the case f (n) (p) > 0, a minimum would result.
If, however, n is odd , then (x − p)n is negative for x < p but positive for
x > p. The same argument then shows that f (x) < f (p) on one side of p and
f (x) > f (p) on the other side; thus no local maximum or minimum can exist
at p. This completes the proof. 
f (x) = f (p) + f (n) (qn )

Examples.
(a′ ) Let

f (x) = x2 on E 1 and p = 0.

Then
f ′ (x) = 2x and f ′′ (x) = 2 > 0,
so
f ′ (0) = 0 and f ′′ (0) = 2 > 0.
By Theorem 2, f (p) = 02 = 0 is a minimum value.
It turns out to be a minimum on all of E 1 . Indeed, f ′ (x) > 0 for x > 0,
and f ′ < 0 for x < 0, so f strictly decreases on (−∞, 0) and increases on
(0, +∞).
Actually, even without using Theorem 2, the last argument yields the
answer.
(b′ ) Let
f (x) = ln x on (0, +∞).
Then

1
> 0 on all of (0, +∞).

This shows that f strictly increases everywhere and hence can have no
maximum or minimum anywhere. The same follows by the second part
of Theorem 2, with n = 1.

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

In this case, f ′′ has no bearing on the existence of a maximum or minimum
because f ′ 6= 0. Still, the formula f ′′ < 0 does have a certain meaning. In
fact, if f ′′ (p) < 0 and f ∈ CD2 on Gp (δ), then (using the same argument
as in Theorem 2) the reader will easily find that
f (x) ≤ f (p) + f ′ (p)(x − p)

for x in some Gp (ε), 0 < ε ≤ δ.

(10)

Since y = f (p) + f ′ (p)(x − p) is the equation of the tangent at p, it follows
that f (x) ≤ y; i.e., near p the curve lies below the tangent at p.
Similarly, f ′′ (p) > 0 and f ∈ CD2 on Gp (δ) implies that the curve near
p lies above the tangent.

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

§7. The Total Variation (Length) of a Function f : E 1 → E
The question that we shall consider now is how to define reasonably (and
precisely) the notion of the length of a curve (Chapter 4, §10) described by a
function f : E 1 → E over an interval I = [a, b], i.e., f [I].
We proceed as follows (see Figure 24).1
Subdivide [a, b] by a finite set of
points P = {t0 , t1 , . . . , tm }, with
q = f (c)

a = t0 ≤ t1 ≤ · · · ≤ tm = b;

q2 = f (t2 )

q1 = f (t1 )

P is called a partition of [a, b]. Let
qi = f (ti ),

i = 1, 2, . . . , m,

f : E1 → E2

and, for i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
∆i f = qi − qi−1

q3 = f (t3 )

= f (ti ) − f (ti−1 ).

q0 = f (t0 )

We also define
m
m
X
X
S(f, P ) =
|∆i f | =
|qi − qi−1 |.
i=1

Figure 24

i=1

Geometrically, |∆i f | = |qi −qi−1 | is the length of the line segment L[qi−1 , qi ]
in E, and S(f, P ) is the sum of such lengths, i.e., the length of the polygon
W =

m
[

L[qi−1 , qi ]

i=1

inscribed into f [I]; we denote it by
ℓW = S(f, P ).
Now suppose we add a new partition point c, with
ti−1 ≤ c ≤ ti .
Then we obtain a new partition
Pc = {t0 , . . . , ti−1 , c, ti , . . . , tm },
called a refinement of P , and a new inscribed polygon Wc in which L[qi−1 , qi ] is
replaced by two segments, L[qi−1 , q] and L[q, qi ], where q = f (c); see Figure 24.
Accordingly, the term |∆i f | = |qi − qi−1 | in S(f, P ) is replaced by
|qi − q| + |q − qi−1 | ≥ |qi − qi−1 |
1

(triangle law).

Note that this method works even if f is discontinuous.

§7. The Total Variation (Length) of a Function f : E 1 → E

301

It follows that
S(f, P ) ≤ S(f, Pc ); i.e., ℓW ≤ ℓWc .
Hence we obtain the following result.
Corollary 1. The sum S(f, P ) = ℓW cannot decrease when P is refined .
Thus when new partition points are added, S(f, P ) grows in general; i.e.,
it approaches some supremum value (finite or not). Roughly speaking, the
inscribed polygon W gets “closer” to the curve. It is natural to define the
desired length of the curve to be the lub of all lengths ℓW , i.e., of all sums
S(f, P ) resulting from the various partitions P . This supremum is also called
the total variation of f over [a, b], denoted Vf [a, b].2
Definition 1.
Given any function f : E 1 → E, and I = [a, b] ⊂ E 1 , we set
Vf [I] = Vf [a, b] = sup S(f, P ) = sup
P

P

m
X
i=1

|f (ti ) − f (ti−1 )| ≥ 0 in E ∗ ,

(1)

where the supremum is over all partitions P = {t0 , . . . , tm } of I. We call
Vf [I] the total variation, or length, of f on I. Briefly, we denote it by Vf .
Note 1. If f is continuous on [a, b], the image set A = f [I] is an arc
(Chapter 4, §10). It is customary to call Vf [I] the length of that arc, denoted
ℓf A or briefly ℓA. Note, however, that there may well be another function
g, continuous on an interval J, such that g[J] = A but Vf [I] 6= Vg [J], and
so ℓf A 6= ℓg A. Thus it is safer to say “the length of A as described by f on
I.” Only for simple arcs (where f is one to one), is “ℓA” unambiguous. (See
Problems 6–8.)
In the propositions below, f is an arbitrary function, f : E 1 → E.
Theorem 1 (additivity of Vf ). If a ≤ c ≤ b, then

Vf [a, b] = Vf [a, c] + Vf [c, b];
i .e., the length of the whole equals the sum of the lengths of the parts.
Proof. Take any partition P = {t0 , . . . , tm } of [a, b]. If c ∈
/ P , refine P to
Pc = {t0 , . . . , ti , c, ti , . . . , tm }.
Then by Corollary 1, S(f, P ) ≤ S(f, Pc ).
Now Pc splits into partitions of [a, c] and [c, b], namely,
P ′ = {t0 , . . . , ti−1 , c} and P ′′ = {c, ti , . . . , tm },
2

We also call it the length of f over [a, b]. Observe that, for real f : E 1 → E 1 , this is not
the length of the graph in the usual sense (which is a curve in E 2 ). See the end of §8.

302

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

so that
S(f, P ′ ) + S(f, P ′′ ) = S(f, Pc ).

(Verify!)

Hence (as Vf is the lub of the corresponding sums),
Vf [a, c] + Vf [c, d] ≥ S(f, Pc ) ≥ S(f, P ).
As P is an arbitrary partition of [a, b], we also have
Vf [a, c] + Vf [c, b] ≥ sup S(f, P ) = Vf [a, b].
Thus it remains to show that, conversely,
Vf [a, b] ≥ Vf [a, c] + Vf [c, b].
The latter is trivial if Vf [a, b] = +∞. Thus assume Vf [a, b] = K < +∞. Let
P ′ and P ′′ be any partitions of [a, c] and [c, b], respectively. Then P ∗ = P ′ ∪P ′′
is a partition of [a, b], and
S(f, P ′ ) + S(f, P ′′ ) = S(f, P ∗ ) ≤ Vf [a, b] = K,
whence
S(f, P ′ ) ≤ K − S(f, P ′′ ).
Keeping P ′′ fixed and varying P ′ , we see that K − S(f, P ′′ ) is an upper bound
of all S(f, P ′ ) over [a, c]. Hence
Vf [a, c] ≤ K − S(f, P ′′ )
or
S(f, P ′′ ) ≤ K − Vf [a, c].
Similarly, varying P ′′ , we now obtain
Vf [c, b] ≤ K − Vf [a, c]
or
Vf [a, c] + Vf [c, b] ≤ K = Vf [a, b],
as required. Thus all is proved. 
Corollary 2 (monotonicity of Vf ). If a ≤ c ≤ d ≤ b, then
Vf [c, d] ≤ Vf [a, b].
Proof. By Theorem 1,
Vf [a, b] = Vf [a, c] + Vf [c, d] + Vf [d, b] ≥ Vf [c, d].

§7. The Total Variation (Length) of a Function f : E 1 → E

303

Definition 2.
If Vf [a, b] < +∞, we say that f is of bounded variation on I = [a, b], and
that the set f [I] is rectifiable (by f on I).
Corollary 3. For each t ∈ [a, b],
|f (t) − f (a)| ≤ Vf [a, b].
Hence if f is of bounded variation on [a, b], it is bounded on [a, b].
Proof. If t ∈ [a, b], let P = {a, t, b}, so
|f (t) − f (a)| ≤ |f (t) − f (a)| + |f (b) − f (t)| = S(f, P ) ≤ Vf [a, b],

proving our first assertion.3 Hence

(∀ t ∈ [a, b]) |f (t)| ≤ |f (t) − f (a)| + |f (a)| ≤ Vf [a, b] + |f (a)|.
This proves the second assertion. 
Note 2. Neither boundedness, nor continuity, nor differentiability of f on
[a, b] implies Vf [a, b] < +∞, but boundedness of f ′ does. (See Problems 1 and
3.)
Corollary 4. A function f is finite and constant on [a, b] iff Vf [a, b] = 0.
The proof is left to the reader. (Use Corollary 3 and the definitions.)
Theorem 2. Let f, g, h be real or complex (or let f and g be vector valued
and h scalar valued ). Then on any interval I = [a, b], we have
(i) V|f | ≤ Vf ;

(ii) Vf ±g ≤ Vf + Vg ; and

(iii) Vhf ≤ sVf + rVh , with r = supt∈I |f (t)| and s = supt∈I |h(t)|.

Hence if f , g, and h are of bounded variation on I, so are f ± g, hf , and |f |.

Proof. We first prove (iii).
Take any partition P = {t0 , . . . , tm } of I. Then
|∆i hf | = |h(ti )f (ti ) − h(ti−1 )f (ti−1 )|

≤ |h(ti )f (ti ) − h(ti−1 )f (ti )| + |h(ti−1 )f (ti ) − h(ti−1 )f (ti−1 )|

= |f (ti )||∆i h| + |h(ti−1 )||∆i f |

≤ r|∆i h| + s|∆i f |.

Adding these inequalities, we obtain
S(hf, P ) ≤ r · S(h, P ) + s · S(f, P ) ≤ rVh + sVf .
3

By our conventions, it also follows that |f (a)| is a finite constant, and so is Vf [a, b]+|f (a)|
if Vf [a, b] < +∞.

304

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

As this holds for all sums S(hf, P ), it holds for their supremum, so
Vhf = sup S(hf, P ) ≤ rVh + sVf ,
as claimed.
Similarly, (i) follows from
|f (ti )| − |f (ti−1 )| ≤ |f (ti ) − f (ti−1 )|.
The analogous proof of (ii) is left to the reader.
Finally, (i)–(iii) imply that Vf , Vf ±g , and Vhf are finite if Vf , Vg , and Vh
are. This proves our last assertion. 
Note 3. Also f /h is of bounded variation on I if f and h are, provided h
is bounded away from 0 on I; i.e.,
(∃ ε > 0) |h| ≥ ε on I.
(See Problem 5.)
Special theorems apply in case the range space E is E 1 or E n (∗ or C n ).
Theorem 3.
(i) A real function f is of bounded variation on I = [a, b] iff f = g − h for
some nondecreasing real functions g and h on I.
(ii) If f is real and monotone on I, it is of bounded variation there.
Proof. We prove (ii) first.
Let f ↑ on I. If P = {t0 , . . . , tm }, then
ti ≥ ti−1 implies f (ti ) ≥ f (ti−1 ).
Hence ∆i f ≥ 0; i.e., |∆i f | = ∆i f . Thus
S(f, P ) =

= f (tm ) − f (t0 ) = f (b) − f (a)
for any P . (Verify!) This implies that also

Vf [I] = sup S(f, P ) = f (b) − f (a) < +∞.
Thus (ii) is proved.
Now for (i), let f = g − h with g↑ and h↑ on I. By (ii), g and h are of
bounded variation on I. Hence so is f = g − h by Theorem 2 (last clause).
Conversely, suppose Vf [I] < +∞. Then define
g(x) = Vf [a, x], x ∈ I, and h = g − f on I,
so f = g − h, and it only remains to show that g↑ and h↑.

305

§7. The Total Variation (Length) of a Function f : E 1 → E

To prove it, let a ≤ x ≤ y ≤ b. Then Theorem 1 yields
Vf [a, y] − Vf [a, x] = Vf [x, y];
i.e.,
g(y) − g(x) = Vf [x, y] ≥ |f (y) − f (x)| ≥ 0

(by Corollary 3).

(2)

Hence g(y) ≥ g(x). Also, as h = g − f , we have
h(y) − h(x) = g(y) − f (y) − [g(x) − f (x)]

= g(y) − g(x) − [f (y) − f (x)]

≥0

by (2).

Thus h(y) ≥ h(x). We see that a ≤ x ≤ y ≤ b implies g(x) ≤ g(y) and
h(x) ≤ h(y), so h↑ and g↑, indeed. 
Theorem 4.
(i) A function f : E 1 → E n (∗ C n ) is of bounded variation on I = [a, b] iff
all of its components (f1 , f2 , . . . , fn ) are.
(ii) If this is the case, then finite limits f (p+ ) and f (q − ) exist for every
p ∈ [a, b) and q ∈ (a, b].
Proof.
(i) Take any partition P = {t0 , . . . , tm } of I. Then
|fk (ti ) − fk (ti−1 )|2 ≤

n
X
j=1

|fj (ti ) − fj (ti−1 )|2 = |f (ti ) − f (ti−1 )|2 ;

i.e., |∆i fk | ≤ |∆i f |, i = 1, 2, . . . , m. Thus
(∀ P )

S(fk , P ) ≤ S(f, P ) ≤ Vf ,

and Vfk ≤ Vf follows. Thus
Vf < +∞ implies Vfk < +∞, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Pn
The converse follows by Theorem 2 since f = k=1 fk~ek . (Explain!)

(ii) For real monotone functions, f (p+ ) and f (q − ) exist by Theorem 1 of
Chapter 4, §5. This also applies if f is real and of bounded variation, for
by Theorem 3,
f = g − h with g↑ and h↑ on I,
and so
f (p+ ) = g(p+ ) − h(p+ ) and f (q − ) = g(q − ) − h(q − ) exist.
The limits are finite since f is bounded on I by Corollary 3.

306

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Via components (Theorem 2 of Chapter 4, §3), this also applies to
functions f : E 1 → E n . (Why?) In particular, (ii) applies to complex
functions (treat C as E 2 ) (∗ and so it extends to functions f : E 1 → C n
as well). 
We also have proved the following corollary.
Corollary 5. A complex function f : E 1 → C is of bounded variation on [a, b]
iff its real and imaginary parts are. (See Chapter 4, §3, Note 5.)

§8. Rectifiable Arcs. Absolute Continuity
If a function f : E 1 → E is of bounded variation (§7) on an interval I = [a, b],
we can define a real function vf on I by
vf (x) = Vf [a, x] (= total variation of f on [a, x]) for x ∈ I;
vf is called the total variation function, or length function, generated by f on
I. Note that vf ↑ on I. (Why?) We now consider the case where f is also

§8. Rectifiable Arcs. Absolute Continuity

309

relatively continuous on I, so that the set A = f [I] is a rectifiable arc (see §7,
Note 1 and Definition 2).
Definition 1.
A function f : E 1 → E is (weakly) absolutely continuous 1 on I = [a, b] iff
Vf [I] < +∞ and f is relatively continuous on I.
Theorem 1. The following are equivalent:
(i) f is (weakly) absolutely continuous on I = [a, b];
(ii) vf is finite and relatively continuous on I; and
(iii) (∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x, y ∈ I | 0 ≤ y − x < δ) Vf [x, y] < ε.
Proof. We shall show that (ii) ⇒ (iii) ⇒ (i) ⇒ (ii).
(ii) ⇒ (iii). As I = [a, b] is compact, (ii) implies that vf is uniformly
continuous on I (Theorem 4 of Chapter 4, §8). Thus
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x, y ∈ I | 0 ≤ y − x < δ) vf (y) − vf (x) < ε.
However,
vf (y) − vf (x) = Vf [a, y] − Vf [a, x] = Vf [x, y]
by additivity (Theorem 1 in §7). Thus (iii) follows.
(iii) ⇒ (i). By Corollary 3 of §7, |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ Vf [x, y]. Therefore, (iii)
implies that
(∀ ε > 0) (∃ δ > 0) (∀ x, y ∈ I | |x − y| < δ) |f (x) − f (y)| < ε,
and so f is relatively (even uniformly) continuous on I.
Now with ε and δ as in (iii), take a partition P = {t0 , . . . , tm } of I so fine
that
ti − ti−1 < δ, i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
Then (∀ i) Vf [ti−1 , ti ] < ε. Adding up these m inequalities and using the
additivity of Vf , we obtain
Vf [I] =

Vf [ti−1 , ti ] < mε < +∞.

Thus (i) follows, by definition.
That (i) ⇒ (ii) is given as the next theorem. 

In this section, we use this notion in a weaker sense than customary. The usual stronger
version is given in Problem 2. We study it in Volume 2, Chapter 7, §11.

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Theorem 2. If Vf [I] < +∞ and if f is relatively continuous at some p ∈ I
(over I = [a, b]), then the same applies to the length function vf .
Proof. We consider left continuity first, with a < p ≤ b.
Let ε > 0. By assumption, there is δ > 0 such that
|f (x) − f (p)| <

ε
when |x − p| < δ and x ∈ [a, p].

However,
Vf [a, p] = vf (p)
and
Vf [a, tk−1 ] = Vf [a, x] = vf (x).
Thus (1) yields
|vf (p) − vf (x)| = Vf [a, p] − Vf [a, x] < ε for x ∈ [a, p] with |x − p| < δ.
This shows that vf is left continuous at p.
Right continuity is proved similarly on noting that
vf (x) − vf (p) = Vf [p, b] − Vf [x, b] for p ≤ x < b. (Why?)
Thus vf is, indeed, relatively continuous at p. Observe that vf is also of
bounded variation on I, being monotone and finite (see Theorem 3(ii) of §7).
This completes the proof of both Theorem 2 and Theorem 1. 
We also have the following.

311

§8. Rectifiable Arcs. Absolute Continuity

Corollary 1. If f is real and absolutely continuous on I = [a, b] (weakly),
so are the nondecreasing functions g and h (f = g − h) defined in Theorem 3
of §7.

Indeed, the function g as defined there is simply vf . Thus it is relatively
continuous and finite on I by Theorem 1. Hence so also is h = f − g. Both are
of bounded variation (monotone!) and hence absolutely continuous (weakly).
Note 1. The proof of Theorem 1 shows that (weak ) absolute continuity
implies uniform continuity. The converse fails, however (see Problem 1(iv)
in §7).
We now apply our theory to antiderivatives (integrals).
R
Corollary 2. If F = f on I = [a, b] and if f is bounded (|f | ≤ K ∈ E 1 ) on
I − Q (Q countable), then F is weakly absolutely continuous on I.

(Actually, even the stronger variety of absolute continuity follows. See Chapter 7, §11, Problem 17).
R
Proof. By definition, F = f is finite and relatively continuous on I, so we
only have to show that VF [I] < +∞. This, however, easily follows by Problem 3
of §7 on noting that F ′ = f on I − S (S countable). Details are left to the
reader. 
Our next theorem expresses arc length in the form of an integral.
Theorem R3. If f : E 1 → E is continuously differentiable on I = [a, b] (§6),
then vf = |f ′ | on I and
Z b
|f ′ |.
Vf [a, b] =

Proof. Let a < p < x ≤ b, ∆x = x − p, and
∆vf = vf (x) − vf (p) = Vf [p, x].

As a first step, we shall show that
∆vf

Vf [p, x] ≤ sup |f ′ | ∆x,
[p,x]

which implies (2).

On the other hand,

since f ′ is relatively continuous on [a, b], hence also uniformly continuous and
bounded. (Here we assumed a < p < x ≤ b. However, (3) holds also if
a ≤ x < p < b, with ∆vf = −V [x, p] and ∆x < 0. Verify!)
Now
|f ′ (p)| − |f ′ (x)| ≤ |f ′ (p) − f ′ (x)| → 0 as x → p,
so, taking limits as x → p, we obtain

∆vf

x→p ∆x

Thus vf is differentiable at each p in (a, b), with vf′ (p) = |f ′ (p)|. Also, vf is

on [a, b], and we obtain

|f ′ | = vf (b) − vf (a) = Vf [a, b], as asserted. 

with the fk differentiable on [a, b]. Curves in E 2 are often given in nonparametric form as
y = F (x), F : E 1 → E 1 .
Here F [I] is not the desired curve but simply a set in E 1 . To apply (5) here,
we first replace “y = F (x)” by suitable parametric equations,
x = f1 (t) and y = f2 (t);
i.e., we introduce a function f : E 1 → E, with f = (f1 , f2 ). An obvious (but
not the only) way of achieving it is to set
x = f1 (t) = t and y = f2 (t) = F (t)
so that f1′ = 1 and f2′ = F ′ . Then formula (5) may be written as

Vf [a, b] =
1 + F ′ (x)2 dx, f (x) = (x, F (x)).

Example.

Find the length of the circle
x2 + y 2 = r 2 .
Here it is convenient to use the parametric equations
x = r cos t and y = r sin t,
i.e., to define f : E 1 → E 2 by
f (t) = (r cos t, r sin t),
or, in complex notation,
f (t) = reti .
Then the circle is obtained by letting t vary through [0, 2π]. Thus (5)

Note that f describes the same circle A = f [I] over I = [0, 4π]. More
generally, we could let t vary through any interval [a, b] with b − a ≥
2π. However, the length, Vf [a, b], would change (depending on b − a).
This is because the circle A = f [I] is not a simple arc (see §7, Note 1),
so ℓA depends on f and I, and one must be careful in selecting both
appropriately.

3. Prove that vf is strictly monotone on [a, b] iff f is not constant on any
nondegenerate subinterval of [a, b].
[Hint: If x < y, Vf [x, y] > 0, by Corollary 4 of §7].

4. With f, g, h as in Theorem 2 of §7, prove that if f, g, h are absolutely
continuous (in the weaker sense) on I, so are f ± g, hf , and |f |; so also
is f /h if (∃ ε > 0) |h| ≥ ε on I.

5. Prove the following:

(i) If f ′ is finite and 6= 0 on I = [a, b], so also is vf′ (with one-sided
derivatives at the endpoints of the interval); moreover,
f′
= 1 on I.
vf′
Thus show that f ′ /vf′ is the tangent unit vector (see §1).

(ii) Under the same assumptions, F = f ◦ vf−1 is differentiable on
J = [0, vf (b)] (with one-sided derivatives at the endpoints of the
interval) and F [J] = f [I]; i.e., F and f describe the same simple
arc, with VF [I] = Vf [I].
Note that this is tantamount to a change of parameter . Setting
s = vf (t), i.e., t = vf−1 (s), we have f (t) = f (vf−1 (s)) = F (s), with
the arclength s as parameter .

what can one say about lim fn or (lim Fn )′ if the limits exist? Below we give
some answers, for complete range spaces E (such as E n ). Roughly, we have

§9. Convergence Theorems in Differentiation and Integration

315

lim Fn′ = (lim Fn )′ on I − Q if

(a) {Fn (p)} converges for at least one p ∈ I and

(b) {Fn′ } converges uniformly.

Here I is a finite or infinite interval in E 1 and Q is countable. We include in
Q the endpoints of I (if any), so I − Q ⊆ I 0 (= interior of I).

Theorem 1. Let Fn : E 1 → E (n = 1, 2, . . . ) be finite and relatively continuous on I and differentiable on I − Q. Suppose that
(a) limn→∞ Fn (p) exists for some p ∈ I;

(b) Fn′ → f 6= ±∞ (uniformly) on J − Q for each finite subinterval J ⊆ I;
(c) E is complete.

Then
(i) limn→∞ Fn = F exists uniformly on each finite subinterval J ⊆ I;
R
(ii) F = f on I; and

(iii) (lim Fn )′ = F ′ = f = limn→∞ Fn′ on I − Q.

Proof. Fix ε > 0 and any subinterval J ⊆ I of length δ < ∞, with p ∈ J (p
as in (a)). By (b), Fn′ → f (uniformly) on J − Q, so there is a k such that for
m, n > k,
ε

|Fn′ (t) − f (t)| < , t ∈ J − Q;
2
hence
′
sup |Fm
(t) − Fn′ (t)| ≤ ε.

(Why?)

(2)

t∈J−Q

Now apply Corollary 1 in §4 to the function h = Fm − Fn on J. Then for
each x ∈ J, |h(x) − h(p)| ≤ M |x − p|, where
M ≤ sup |h′ (t)| ≤ ε
t∈J−Q

by (2). Hence for m, n > k, x ∈ J and
|Fm (x) − Fn (x) − Fm (p) + Fn (p)| ≤ ε|x − p| ≤ εδ.

(3)

As ε is arbitrary, this shows that the sequence
{Fn − Fn (p)}
satisfies the uniform Cauchy criterion (Chapter 4, §12, Theorem 3). Thus as E
is complete, {Fn − Fn (p)} converges uniformly on J. So does {Fn }, for {Fn (p)}
converges, by (a). Thus we may set
F = lim Fn (uniformly) on J,

316

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

proving assertion (i).1
Here by Theorem 2 of Chapter 4, §12, F is relatively continuous on each
such J ⊆ I, hence on all of I. Also, letting m → +∞ (with n fixed), we have
Fm → F in (3), and it follows that for n > k and x ∈ Gp (δ) ∩ I.
|F (x) − Fn (x) − F (p) + Fn (p)| ≤ ε|x − p| ≤ εδ.

(4)

Having proved (i), we may now treat p as just any point in I. Thus formula
(4) holds for any globe Gp (δ), p ∈ I. We now show that
Z
′
F = f on I − Q; i.e., F = f on I.
Indeed, if p ∈ I − Q, each Fn is differentiable at p (by assumption), and
p ∈ I 0 (since I − Q ⊆ I 0 by our convention). Thus for each n, there is δn > 0
such that

By assumption (b) and by (4), we can fix n so large that

and so that (4) holds for δ = δn . Then, dividing by |∆x| = |x − p|, we have

i.e., F ′ = f on I − Q, with f finite by assumption, and F finite by (4). As F
is also relatively continuous on I, assertion (ii) is proved, and (iii) follows since
F = lim Fn and f = lim Fn′ . 
Note 1. The same proof also shows that Fn → F (uniformly) on each closed
subinterval J ⊆ I if Fn′ → f (uniformly) on J − Q for all such J (with the
other assumptions unchanged). In any case, we then have Fn → F (pointwise)
on all of I.
We now apply Theorem 1 to antiderivatives.

Indeed, any J can be enlarged to include p, so (3) applies to it. Note that in (3) we may
as well vary x inside any set of the form I ∩ Gp (δ).

Then Fn (p) = p fn = 0, and so limn→∞ Fn (p) = 0 exists, as required in Theorem 1(a).

the same, so we replace them by
Q=

(including in Q also the endpoints of I, if any). Then Q is countable (see
Chapter 1, §9, Theorem 2), and I − Q ⊆ I − Qn , so all Fn are differentiable
on I − Q, with Fn′ = fn there.
Additionally, by assumption,
fn → f (uniformly)
on finite subintervals J ⊆ I. Hence

Fn′ → f (uniformly) on J − Q

for all such J, and so the conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied.

§10. Sufficient Condition of Integrability. Regulated Functions
In this section, we shall determine a large family of functions that do have
antiderivatives. First, we give a general definition, valid for any range space
(T, p) (not necessarily E). The domain space remains E 1 .

§10. Sufficient Condition of Integrability. Regulated Functions

323

Definition 1.
A function f : E 1 → (T, p) is said to be regulated on an interval I ⊆ E 1 ,
with endpoints a < b, iff the limits f (p− ) and f (p+ ), other than ±∞,1
exist at each p ∈ I. However, at the endpoints a, b, if in I, we only
require f (a+ ) and f (b− ) to exist.
Examples.
(a) If f is relatively continuous and finite on I, it is regulated.
(b) Every real monotone function is regulated (see Chapter 4, §5, Theorem 1).

(c) If f : E 1 → E n (∗ C n ) has bounded variation on I, it is regulated (§7,
Theorem 4).2

(d) The characteristic function of a set B, denoted CB , is defined by
CB (x) = 1 if x ∈ B and CB = 0 on −B.
For any interval J ⊆ E 1 , CJ is regulated on E 1 .
(e) A function S
f is called a step function on I iff I can be represented as the
union, I = k Ik , of a sequence of disjoint intervals Ik such that f is constant and 6= ±∞ on each Ik . Note that some Ik may be singletons, {p}.3
If the number of the Ik is finite, we call f a simple step function.
When the range space T is E, we can give the following convenient
alternative definition. If, say, f = ak 6= ±∞ on Ik , then
X
f=
ak CIk on I,
k

P
where CIk is as in (d). Note that k ak CIk (x) always exists for disjoint
Ik . (Why?)
Each simple step function is regulated . (Why?)
Theorem 1. Let the functions f, g, h be real or complex (or let f, g be vector
valued and h scalar valued ).
If they are regulated on I, so are f ± g, f h, and |f |; so also is f /h if h is
bounded away from 0 on I, i .e., (∃ ε > 0) |h| ≥ ε on I.
The proof, based on the usual limit properties, is left to the reader.
We shall need two lemmas. One is the famous Heine–Borel lemma.
1

This restriction is necessary in integration only, in the case T = E 1 or T = E ∗ .
Actually, this applies to any f : E 1 → E, with E complete and Vf [I] < +∞ (Problem 7).
3 The endpoints of the I may be treated as such degenerate intervals.

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Lemma 1 (Heine–Borel). If a closed interval A = [a, b] in E 1 (or E n ) is
covered by open sets Gi (i ∈ I), i.e.,
[
A⊆
Gi ,
i∈I

then A can be covered by a finite number of these Gi .
The proof was sketched in Problem 10 of Chapter 4, §6.

Note 1. This fails for nonclosed intervals A. For example, let

Then

for any finite m. (Why?)
The lemma also fails for nonopen sets Gi . For example, cover A by singletons
{x}, x ∈ A. Then none of the {x} can be dropped!

Lemma 2. If a function f : E 1 → T is regulated on I = [a, b], then f can be
uniformly approximated by simple step functions on I.
That is, for any ε > 0, there is a simple step function g, with ρ(f, g) ≤ ε
on I; hence
sup ρ(f (x), g(x)) ≤ ε.
x∈I

Proof. By assumption, f (p− ) exists for each p ∈ (a, b], and f (p+ ) exists for
p ∈ [a, b), all finite.
Thus, given ε > 0 and any p ∈ I, there is Gp (δ) (δ depending on p) such
that ρ(f (x), r) < ε whenever r = f (p− ) and x ∈ (p − δ, p), and ρ(f (x), s) < ε
whenever s = f (p+ ) and x ∈ (p, p + δ); x ∈ I.
We choose such a Gp (δ) for every p ∈ I. Then the open globes Gp = Gp (δ)
cover the closed interval I = [a, b], so by Lemma 1, I is covered by a finite
number of such globes, say,
I⊆

n
[

k=1

Gpk (δk ),

a ∈ Gp1 , a ≤ p1 < p2 < · · · < pn ≤ b.

We now define the step function g on I as follows.
If x = pk , we put
g(x) = f (pk ),
If x ∈ [a, p1 ), then

k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

g(x) = f (p−
1 ).

§10. Sufficient Condition of Integrability. Regulated Functions

If x ∈ (p1 , p1 + δ1 ), then

325

g(x) = f (p+
1 ).

More generally, if x is in G¬pk (δk ) but in none of the Gpi (δi ), i < k, we put
g(x) = f (p−
k)
and

if x < pk

g(x) = f (p+
k ) if x > pk .

Then by construction, ρ(f, g) < ε on each Gpk , hence on I. 
∗

Note 2. If T is complete, we can say more: f is regulated on I = [a, b] iff
f is uniformly approximated by simple step functions on I. (See Problem 2.)
Theorem 2. IfR f : E 1 → E is regulated on an interval I ⊆ E 1 and if E is
complete, then f exists on I, exact at every continuity point of f in I 0 .
In particular, all continuous maps f : E 1 → E n (∗ C n ) have exact primitives.
Proof. In view of Problem 14 of §5, it suffices to consider closed intervals.
Thus let I = [a, b], a < b, in
1
Y
E . Suppose first that f is the characteristic function CJ of a subinterd
val J ⊆ I with endpoints c and d
(a ≤ c ≤ d ≤ b), so f = 1 on J,
c
and f = 0 on I − J. We then define
F (x) = x on J, F = c on [a, c], and
F = d on [d, b] (see Figure 25). Thus

a c

F is continuous (why?), and F ′ = f

Then, however, so is any simple step function
f=

by repeated use of Corollary 1 in §5.4

εn = n1 , there is a simple step function gn such that
sup |gn (x) − f (x)| ≤
x∈I

1
,
n

n = 1, 2, . . . .

As n1 → 0, this implies that gn → f (uniformly) on I (see Chapter 4, §12,
Theorem 1). Also, by what was proved above, the step functions gn have
4

The corollary applies here also if the ak are vectors (CIk is scalar valued).

In view of the sufficient
condition expressed in Theorem 2, we can now reR
place the assumption “ f exists” in our previous theorems by “f is regulated”
(provided E is complete). For example, let us now review Problems 7 and 8
in §5.
Theorem 3 (weighted law of the mean). Let f : E 1 → E (E complete) and
g : E 1 → E 1 be regulated on I = [a, b], with g ≥ 0 on I.5 Then the following
are true:
(i) There is a finite c ∈ E (called the “g-weighted mean of f on I”) such
Rb

that a gf = c a g.

(ii) If f , too, is real and has the Darboux property on I, then c = f (q) for
some q ∈ I.
Proof. Indeed,
R as f Rand g are regulated, so is gf by Theorem 1. Hence by
Theorem 2, f and gf exist on I. The rest follows as in Problems 7 and 8
of §5. 

§11. Integral Definitions of Some Functions

§11. Integral Definitions of Some Functions
R
By Theorem 2 in §10, f exists on I whenever the function f : E 1 → E is
regulated on I, and E is complete. Hence whenever such an f is given, we can
define a new function F by setting
Z x
F =
f
a

on I for some a ∈ I. This is a convenient method of obtaining new continuous
functions, differentiable on I −Q (Q countable). We shall now apply it to obtain
new definitions of some functions previously defined in a rather strenuous stepby-step manner.
I. Logarithmic and Exponential Functions. From our former definitions, we proved that
Z x
1
ln x =
dt, x > 0.
1 t
Now we want to treat this as a definition of logarithms. We start by setting
f (t) =

1
,
t

t ∈ E 1 , t 6= 0,

and f (0) = 0.
Then f is continuous on I = (0, +∞) and J = (−∞, 0), so it has an exact
primitive on I and J separately (not on E 1 ). Thus we can now define the log
function on I by
Z x
1
dt = log x (also written ln x) for x > 0.
(1)
1 t
By the very definition of an exact primitive, the log function is continuous
and differentiable on I = (0, +∞); its derivative on I is f . Thus we again have



Note 1. Actually, (vi) holds for any r ∈ E 1 , with ar as in Chapter 2,
§§11–12. One uses the techniques from that section to prove it first for rational
r, and then it follows for all real r by continuity. However, we prefer not to use
this now.
Next, we define the exponential function (“exp”) to be the inverse of the
log function. This inverse function exists; it is continuous (even differentiable)
and strictly increasing on its domain (by Theorem 3 of Chapter 4, §9 and
Theorem 3 of Chapter 5, §2) since the log function has these properties. From
(log x)′ = 1/x we get, as in §2,
(exp x)′ = exp x (cf. §2, Example (B)).

(3)

The domain of the exponential is the range of its inverse, i.e., E 1 (cf. Theorem 1(iv)). Thus exp x is defined for all x ∈ E 1 . The range of exp is the domain

334

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

of log, i.e., (0, +∞). Hence exp x > 0 for all x ∈ E 1 . Also, by definition,
exp(log x) = x for x > 0,

(4)

exp 0 = 1 (cf. Theorem 1(i)), and
r

exp r = e for r ∈ N.

(5)
(6)

Indeed, by Theorem 1(vi) and (vii), log er = r · log e = r. Hence (6) follows.
If the definitions and rules of Chapter 2, §§11–12 are used, this proof even
works for any r by Note 1. Thus our new definition of exp agrees with the old
one.
Our next step is to give a new definition of ar , for any a, r ∈ E 1 (a > 0).
We set
ar = exp(r · log a) or
r

log a = r · log a

(7)
1

(r ∈ E ).

(8)

In case r ∈ N , (8) becomes Theorem 1(vi). Thus for natural r, our new
definition of ar is consistent with the previous one. We also obtain, for a, b > 0,
(ab)r = ar br ;

ars = (ar )s ;

ar+s = ar as ;

(r, s ∈ E 1 ).

(9)

The proof is by taking logarithms. For example,
log(ab)r = r log ab = r(log a + log b) = r · log a + r · log b
= log ar + log br = log(ar br ).

Thus (ab)r = ar br . Similar arguments can be given for the rest of (9) and other
laws stated in Chapter 2, §§11–12.
We can now define the exponential to the base a (a > 0) and its inverse, loga ,
as before (see the example in Chapter 4, §5 and Example (b) in Chapter 4, §9).
The differentiability of the former is now immediate from (7), and the rest
follows as before.
II. Trigonometric Functions. These shall now be defined in a precise
analytic manner (not based on geometry).
We start with an integral definition of what is usually called the principal
value of the arcsine function,
Z x
1
√
arcsin x =

1 − t2

We shall denote it by F (x) and set

(F = f = 0 on E 1 − I.) Thus by definition, F = f on I.
f (x) = √

Note that

f exists and is exact on I since f is continuous on I. Thus
F ′ (x) = f (x) = √

for x ∈ I,

and so F is strictly increasing on I. Also, F (0) = 0 f = 0.
We also define the number π by setting

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

Note 2. In classical analysis, the last integrals are regarded as so-called
improper integrals, i.e., limits of integrals rather than integrals proper. In our
theory, this is unnecessary since F0 is a genuine primitive of f on I.
For each integer n (negatives included), we now define Fn : E 1 → E 1 by
Fn (x) = nπ + (−1)n F0 (x) for x ∈ I = [−1, 1],

(12)

on − I.

Fn = 0

Fn is called the nth branch of the arcsine. Figure 26 shows the graphs of F0
and F1 (that of F1 is dotted ). We now obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 3.
(i) Each Fn is differentiable on I = (−1, 1) and relatively continuous on
I = [−1, 1].
(ii) Fn is increasing on I if n is even, and decreasing if n is odd .

(iv) Fn (−1) = Fn−1 (−1) = nπ − (−1)n ; Fn (1) = Fn−1 (1) = nπ + (−1)n .

The proof is obvious from (12) and the
properties of F0 . Assertion (iv) ensures
that the graphs of the Fn add up to one
curve. By (ii), each Fn is one to one
(strictly monotone) on I. Thus it has a
strictly monotone inverse on the interval
Jn = Fn [[−1, 1]], i.e., on the Fn -image of
I. For simplicity, we consider only

§11. Integral Definitions of Some Functions

On the rest of E 1 , we define sin x and cos x periodically by setting
sin(x + 2nπ) = sin x and cos(x + 2nπ) = cos x,

n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .

(15)

Note that by Theorem 3(iv),
π 
π 

Thus (13) and (14) both yield sin π/2 = 1 for the common endpoint π/2 of J0
and J1 , so the two formulas are consistent. We also have
 π
 3π 

in agreement with (15). Thus the sine and cosine functions (briefly, s and c)
are well defined on E 1 .
Theorem 4. The sine and cosine functions (s and c) are differentiable, hence
continuous, on all of E 1 , with derivatives s′ = c and c′ = −s; that is,
(sin x)′ = cos x and (cos x)′ = − sin x.

Proof. It suffices to consider the intervals J0 and J1 , for, by (15), all properties
of s and c repeat themselves, with period 2π, on the rest of E 1 .
By (13),
h π πi
s = F0−1 on J0 = − ,
,
2 2
where F0 is differentiable on I = (−1, 1). Thus Theorem 3 of §2 shows that s
is differentiable on J0 = (−π/2, π/2) and that
s′ (q) =

F0′ (p)

whenever p ∈ I and q = F0 (p);

i.e., q ∈ J and p = s(q). However, by Theorem 3(iii),

Hence

F0′ (p) = p

q ∈ J.

This proves the theorem for interior points of J0 as far as s is concerned.
As

c = 1 − s2 = (1 − s2 ) 2 on J0 (by (13)),

we can use the chain rule (Theorem 3 in §1) to obtain
c′ =

Chapter 5. Differentiation and Antidifferentiation

on noting that s′ = c = (1 − s2 ) 2 on J0 . Similarly, using (14), one proves that
s′ = c and c′ = −s on J1 (interior of J1 ).
Next, let q be an endpoint, say, q = π/2. We take the left derivative
s′− (q) = lim

x→q −

By L’Hôpital’s rule, we get

s(x) − s(q)

s′− (q) = lim

s′ (x)

since s√
= c on J0 . However, s = F0−1 is left continuous at q (why?); hence so
is c = 1 − s2 . (Why?) Therefore,

s′− (q) = lim c(x) = c(q),
x→q −

as required.

Similarly, one shows that s′+ (q) = c(q). Hence s′ (q) = c(q) and c′ (q) = −s(q),
as before. 
