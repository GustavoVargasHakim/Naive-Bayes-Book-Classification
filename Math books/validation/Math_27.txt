Preface
Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems is written for students in science, engineering, and mathematics who have completed calculus through partial differentiation. If your syllabus
includes Chapter 10 (Linear Systems of Differential Equations), your students should have some preparation in linear algebra.
In writing this book I have been guided by the these principles:
• An elementary text should be written so the student can read it with comprehension without too
much pain. I have tried to put myself in the student’s place, and have chosen to err on the side of
too much detail rather than not enough.
• An elementary text can’t be better than its exercises. This text includes 2041 numbered exercises,
many with several parts. They range in difficulty from routine to very challenging.
• An elementary text should be written in an informal but mathematically accurate way, illustrated
by appropriate graphics. I have tried to formulate mathematical concepts succinctly in language
that students can understand. I have minimized the number of explicitly stated theorems and definitions, preferring to deal with concepts in a more conversational way, copiously illustrated by
299 completely worked out examples. Where appropriate, concepts and results are depicted in 188
figures.
Although I believe that the computer is an immensely valuable tool for learning, doing, and writing
mathematics, the selection and treatment of topics in this text reflects my pedagogical orientation along
traditional lines. However, I have incorporated what I believe to be the best use of modern technology,
so you can select the level of technology that you want to include in your course. The text includes 414
exercises – identified by the symbols C and C/G – that call for graphics or computation and graphics.
There are also 79 laboratory exercises – identified by L – that require extensive use of technology. In
addition, several sections include informal advice on the use of technology. If you prefer not to emphasize
technology, simply ignore these exercises and the advice.
There are two schools of thought on whether techniques and applications should be treated together or
separately. I have chosen to separate them; thus, Chapter 2 deals with techniques for solving first order
equations, and Chapter 4 deals with applications. Similarly, Chapter 5 deals with techniques for solving
second order equations, and Chapter 6 deals with applications. However, the exercise sets of the sections
dealing with techniques include some applied problems.
Traditionally oriented elementary differential equations texts are occasionally criticized as being collections of unrelated methods for solving miscellaneous problems. To some extent this is true; after all,
no single method applies to all situations. Nevertheless, I believe that one idea can go a long way toward
unifying some of the techniques for solving diverse problems: variation of parameters. I use variation of
parameters at the earliest opportunity in Section 2.1, to solve the nonhomogeneous linear equation, given
a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation. You may find this annoying, since most of us learned
that one should use integrating factors for this task, while perhaps mentioning the variation of parameters
option in an exercise. However, there’s little difference between the two approaches, since an integrating
factor is nothing more than the reciprocal of a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation. The
advantage of using variation of parameters here is that it introduces the concept in its simplest form and
vii

viii Preface
focuses the student’s attention on the idea of seeking a solution y of a differential equation by writing it
as y = uy1 , where y1 is a known solution of related equation and u is a function to be determined. I use
this idea in nonstandard ways, as follows:
• In Section 2.4 to solve nonlinear first order equations, such as Bernoulli equations and nonlinear
homogeneous equations.
• In Chapter 3 for numerical solution of semilinear first order equations.
• In Section 5.2 to avoid the necessity of introducing complex exponentials in solving a second order constant coefficient homogeneous equation with characteristic polynomials that have complex
zeros.
• In Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 9.3 for the method of undetermined coefficients. (If the method of annihilators is your preferred approach to this problem, compare the labor involved in solving, for
example, y00 + y0 + y = x4 ex by the method of annihilators and the method used in Section 5.4.)
Introducing variation of parameters as early as possible (Section 2.1) prepares the student for the concept when it appears again in more complex forms in Section 5.6, where reduction of order is used not
merely to find a second solution of the complementary equation, but also to find the general solution of the
nonhomogeneous equation, and in Sections 5.7, 9.4, and 10.7, that treat the usual variation of parameters
problem for second and higher order linear equations and for linear systems.
Chapter 11 develops the theory of Fourier series. Section 11.1 discusses the five main eigenvalue problems that arise in connection with the method of separation of variables for the heat and wave equations
and for Laplace’s equation over a rectangular domain:
Problem 1:
y00 + λy = 0, y(0) = 0, y(L) = 0
Problem 2:

y00 + λy = 0,

y0 (0) = 0,

y0 (L) = 0

Problem 3:

y00 + λy = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y0 (L) = 0

Problem 4:

y00 + λy = 0,

y0 (0) = 0,

y(L) = 0

Problem 5:

y00 + λy = 0,

y(−L) = y(L),

y0 (−L) = y0 (L)

These problems are handled in a unified way for example, a single theorem shows that the eigenvalues
of all five problems are nonnegative.
Section 11.2 presents the Fourier series expansion of functions defined on on [−L, L], interpreting it
as an expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of Problem 5.
Section 11.3 presents the Fourier sine and cosine expansions of functions defined on [0, L], interpreting
them as expansions in terms of the eigenfunctions of Problems 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, Section 11.2 includes what I call the mixed Fourier sine and cosine expansions, in terms of the eigenfunctions
of Problems 4 and 5, respectively. In all cases, the convergence properties of these series are deduced
from the convergence properties of the Fourier series discussed in Section 11.1.
Chapter 12 consists of four sections devoted to the heat equation, the wave equation, and Laplace’s
equation in rectangular and polar coordinates. For all three, I consider homogeneous boundary conditions
of the four types occurring in Problems 1-4. I present the method of separation of variables as a way of
choosing the appropriate form for the series expansion of the solution of the given problem, stating—
without belaboring the point—that the expansion may fall short of being an actual solution, and giving
an indication of conditions under which the formal solution is an actual solution. In particular, I found it
necessary to devote some detail to this question in connection with the wave equation in Section 12.2.
In Sections 12.1 (The Heat Equation) and 12.2 (The Wave Equation) I devote considerable effort to
devising examples and numerous exercises where the functions defining the initial conditions satisfy

Preface ix
the homogeneous boundary conditions. Similarly, in most of the examples and exercises Section 12.3
(Laplace’s Equation), the functions defining the boundary conditions on a given side of the rectangular
domain satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions at the endpoints of the same type (Dirichlet or Neumann) as the boundary conditions imposed on adjacent sides of the region. Therefore the formal solutions
obtained in many of the examples and exercises are actual solutions.
Section 13.1 deals with two-point value problems for a second order ordinary differential equation.
Conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions are given, and the construction of Green’s functions
is included.
Section 13.2 presents the elementary aspects of Sturm-Liouville theory.
You may also find the following to be of interest:
• Section 2.6 deals with integrating factors of the form µ = p(x)q(y), in addition to those of the
form µ = p(x) and µ = q(y) discussed in most texts.
• Section 4.4 makes phase plane analysis of nonlinear second order autonomous equations accessible to students who have not taken linear algebra, since eigenvalues and eigenvectors do not enter
into the treatment. Phase plane analysis of constant coefficient linear systems is included in Sections 10.4-6.
• Section 4.5 presents an extensive discussion of applications of differential equations to curves.
• Section 6.4 studies motion under a central force, which may be useful to students interested in the
mathematics of satellite orbits.
• Sections 7.5-7 present the method of Frobenius in more detail than in most texts. The approach
is to systematize the computations in a way that avoids the necessity of substituting the unknown
Frobenius series into each equation. This leads to efficiency in the computation of the coefficients
of the Frobenius solution. It also clarifies the case where the roots of the indicial equation differ by
an integer (Section 7.7).
• The free Student Solutions Manual contains solutions of most of the even-numbered exercises.
• The free Instructor’s Solutions Manual is available by email to wtrench@trinity.edu, subject to
verification of the requestor’s faculty status.
The following observations may be helpful as you choose your syllabus:
• Section 2.3 is the only specific prerequisite for Chapter 3. To accomodate institutions that offer a
separate course in numerical analysis, Chapter 3 is not a prerequisite for any other section in the
text.
• The sections in Chapter 4 are independent of each other, and are not prerequisites for any of the
later chapters. This is also true of the sections in Chapter 6, except that Section 6.1 is a prerequisite
for Section 6.2.
• Chapters 7, 8, and 9 can be covered in any order after the topics selected from Chapter 5. For
example, you can proceed directly from Chapter 5 to Chapter 9.
• The second order Euler equation is discussed in Section 7.4, where it sets the stage for the method
of Frobenius. As noted at the beginning of Section 7.4, if you want to include Euler equations in
your syllabus while omitting the method of Frobenius, you can skip the introductory paragraphs
in Section 7.4 and begin with Definition 7.4.2. You can then cover Section 7.4 immediately after
Section 5.2.
• Chapters 11, 12, and 13 can be covered at any time after the completion of Chapter 5.

Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 APPLICATIONS LEADING TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In order to apply mathematical methods to a physical or “real life” problem, we must formulate the problem in mathematical terms; that is, we must construct a mathematical model for the problem. Many
physical problems concern relationships between changing quantities. Since rates of change are represented mathematically by derivatives, mathematical models often involve equations relating an unknown
function and one or more of its derivatives. Such equations are differential equations. They are the subject
of this book.
Much of calculus is devoted to learning mathematical techniques that are applied in later courses in
mathematics and the sciences; you wouldn’t have time to learn much calculus if you insisted on seeing
a specific application of every topic covered in the course. Similarly, much of this book is devoted to
methods that can be applied in later courses. Only a relatively small part of the book is devoted to
the derivation of specific differential equations from mathematical models, or relating the differential
equations that we study to specific applications. In this section we mention a few such applications.
The mathematical model for an applied problem is almost always simpler than the actual situation
being studied, since simplifying assumptions are usually required to obtain a mathematical problem that
can be solved. For example, in modeling the motion of a falling object, we might neglect air resistance
and the gravitational pull of celestial bodies other than Earth, or in modeling population growth we might
assume that the population grows continuously rather than in discrete steps.
A good mathematical model has two important properties:
• It’s sufficiently simple so that the mathematical problem can be solved.
• It represents the actual situation sufficiently well so that the solution to the mathematical problem
predicts the outcome of the real problem to within a useful degree of accuracy. If results predicted
by the model don’t agree with physical observations, the underlying assumptions of the model must
be revised until satisfactory agreement is obtained.
We’ll now give examples of mathematical models involving differential equations. We’ll return to these
problems at the appropriate times, as we learn how to solve the various types of differential equations that
occur in the models.
All the examples in this section deal with functions of time, which we denote by t. If y is a function of
t, y0 denotes the derivative of y with respect to t; thus,
y0 =

dy
.
dt

Population Growth and Decay
Although the number of members of a population (people in a given country, bacteria in a laboratory culture, wildflowers in a forest, etc.) at any given time t is necessarily an integer, models that use differential
equations to describe the growth and decay of populations usually rest on the simplifying assumption that
the number of members of the population can be regarded as a differentiable function P = P (t). In most
models it is assumed that the differential equation takes the form
P 0 = a(P )P,

(1.1.1)

where a is a continuous function of P that represents the rate of change of population per unit time per
individual. In the Malthusian model, it is assumed that a(P ) is a constant, so (1.1.1) becomes
P 0 = aP.

(1.1.2)

Section 1.1 Applications Leading to Differential Equations

(When you see a name in blue italics, just click on it for information about the person.) This model
assumes that the numbers of births and deaths per unit time are both proportional to the population. The
constants of proportionality are the birth rate (births per unit time per individual) and the death rate
(deaths per unit time per individual); a is the birth rate minus the death rate. You learned in calculus that
if c is any constant then
P = ceat
(1.1.3)
satisfies (1.1.2), so (1.1.2) has infinitely many solutions. To select the solution of the specific problem
that we’re considering, we must know the population P0 at an initial time, say t = 0. Setting t = 0 in
(1.1.3) yields c = P (0) = P0 , so the applicable solution is
P (t) = P0 eat .
This implies that
lim P (t) =

t→∞



∞
0

if a > 0,
if a < 0;

that is, the population approaches infinity if the birth rate exceeds the death rate, or zero if the death rate
exceeds the birth rate.
To see the limitations of the Malthusian model, suppose we’re modeling the population of a country,
starting from a time t = 0 when the birth rate exceeds the death rate (so a > 0), and the country’s
resources in terms of space, food supply, and other necessities of life can support the existing population. Then the prediction P = P0 eat may be reasonably accurate as long as it remains within limits
that the country’s resources can support. However, the model must inevitably lose validity when the prediction exceeds these limits. (If nothing else, eventually there won’t be enough space for the predicted
population!)
This flaw in the Malthusian model suggests the need for a model that accounts for limitations of space
and resources that tend to oppose the rate of population growth as the population increases. Perhaps the
most famous model of this kind is the Verhulst model, where (1.1.2) is replaced by
P 0 = aP (1 − αP ),

(1.1.4)
0

where α is a positive constant. As long as P is small compared to 1/α, the ratio P /P is approximately
equal to a. Therefore the growth is approximately exponential; however, as P increases, the ratio P 0 /P
decreases as opposing factors become significant.
Equation (1.1.4) is the logistic equation. You will learn how to solve it in Section 1.2. (See Exercise 2.2.28.) The solution is
P0
P =
,
αP0 + (1 − αP0 )e−at
where P0 = P (0) > 0. Therefore limt→∞ P (t) = 1/α, independent of P0 .
Figure 1.1.1 shows typical graphs of P versus t for various values of P0 .
Newton’s Law of Cooling
According to Newton’s law of cooling, the temperature of a body changes at a rate proportional to the
difference between the temperature of the body and the temperature of the surrounding medium. Thus, if
Tm is the temperature of the medium and T = T (t) is the temperature of the body at time t, then
T 0 = −k(T − Tm ),

(1.1.5)

where k is a positive constant and the minus sign indicates; that the temperature of the body increases with
time if it’s less than the temperature of the medium, or decreases if it’s greater. We’ll see in Section 4.2
that if Tm is constant then the solution of (1.1.5) is
T = Tm + (T0 − Tm )e−kt ,

(1.1.6)

where T0 is the temperature of the body when t = 0. Therefore limt→∞ T (t) = Tm , independent of T0 .
(Common sense suggests this. Why?)
Figure 1.1.2 shows typical graphs of T versus t for various values of T0 .
Assuming that the medium remains at constant temperature seems reasonable if we’re considering a
cup of coffee cooling in a room, but not if we’re cooling a huge cauldron of molten metal in the same
room. The difference between the two situations is that the heat lost by the coffee isn’t likely to raise the
temperature of the room appreciably, but the heat lost by the cooling metal is. In this second situation we
must use a model that accounts for the heat exchanged between the object and the medium. Let T = T (t)
and Tm = Tm (t) be the temperatures of the object and the medium respectively, and let T0 and Tm0
be their initial values. Again, we assume that T and Tm are related by (1.1.5). We also assume that the
change in heat of the object as its temperature changes from T0 to T is a(T − T0 ) and the change in heat
of the medium as its temperature changes from Tm0 to Tm is am (Tm −Tm0 ), where a and am are positive
constants depending upon the masses and thermal properties of the object and medium respectively. If
we assume that the total heat of the in the object and the medium remains constant (that is, energy is
conserved), then
a(T − T0 ) + am (Tm − Tm0 ) = 0.
Solving this for Tm and substituting the result into (1.1.6) yields the differential equation

Glucose Absorption by the Body
Glucose is absorbed by the body at a rate proportional to the amount of glucose present in the bloodstream.
Let λ denote the (positive) constant of proportionality. Suppose there are G0 units of glucose in the
bloodstream when t = 0, and let G = G(t) be the number of units in the bloodstream at time t > 0.
Then, since the glucose being absorbed by the body is leaving the bloodstream, G satisfies the equation
G0 = −λG.

(1.1.7)

From calculus you know that if c is any constant then
G = ce−λt

(1.1.8)

satisfies (1.1.7), so (1.1.7) has infinitely many solutions. Setting t = 0 in (1.1.8) and requiring that
G(0) = G0 yields c = G0 , so
G(t) = G0 e−λt .
Now let’s complicate matters by injecting glucose intravenously at a constant rate of r units of glucose
per unit of time. Then the rate of change of the amount of glucose in the bloodstream per unit time is
G0 = −λG + r,

(1.1.9)

where the first term on the right is due to the absorption of the glucose by the body and the second term
is due to the injection. After you’ve studied Section 2.1, you’ll be able to show (Exercise 2.1.43) that the
solution of (1.1.9) that satisfies G(0) = G0 is

Chapter 1 Introduction

Graphs of this function are similar to those in Figure 1.1.2. (Why?)
Spread of Epidemics
One model for the spread of epidemics assumes that the number of people infected changes at a rate
proportional to the product of the number of people already infected and the number of people who are
susceptible, but not yet infected. Therefore, if S denotes the total population of susceptible people and
I = I(t) denotes the number of infected people at time t, then S − I is the number of people who are
susceptible, but not yet infected. Thus,
I 0 = rI(S − I),

where r is a positive constant. Assuming that I(0) = I0 , the solution of this equation is
I=

SI0
I0 + (S − I0 )e−rSt

(Exercise 2.2.29). Graphs of this function are similar to those in Figure 1.1.1. (Why?) Since limt→∞ I(t) =
S, this model predicts that all the susceptible people eventually become infected.
Newton’s Second Law of Motion
According to Newton’s second law of motion, the instantaneous acceleration a of an object with constant mass m is related to the force F acting on the object by the equation F = ma. For simplicity, let’s
assume that m = 1 and the motion of the object is along a vertical line. Let y be the displacement of the
object from some reference point on Earth’s surface, measured positive upward. In many applications,
there are three kinds of forces that may act on the object:
(a) A force such as gravity that depends only on the position y, which we write as −p(y), where
p(y) > 0 if y ≥ 0.
(b) A force such as atmospheric resistance that depends on the position and velocity of the object, which
we write as −q(y, y0 )y0 , where q is a nonnegative function and we’ve put y0 “outside” to indicate
that the resistive force is always in the direction opposite to the velocity.
(c) A force f = f(t), exerted from an external source (such as a towline from a helicopter) that depends
only on t.
In this case, Newton’s second law implies that
y00 = −q(y, y0 )y0 − p(y) + f(t),
which is usually rewritten as
y00 + q(y, y0 )y0 + p(y) = f(t).
Since the second (and no higher) order derivative of y occurs in this equation, we say that it is a second
order differential equation.
Interacting Species: Competition
Let P = P (t) and Q = Q(t) be the populations of two species at time t, and assume that each population
would grow exponentially if the other didn’t exist; that is, in the absence of competition we would have
P 0 = aP

and

Q0 = bQ,

(1.1.10)

where a and b are positive constants. One way to model the effect of competition is to assume that
the growth rate per individual of each population is reduced by an amount proportional to the other
population, so (1.1.10) is replaced by
P0
Q0

=
=

aP − αQ
−βP + bQ,

Section 1.2 Basic Concepts

where α and β are positive constants. (Since negative population doesn’t make sense, this system works
only while P and Q are both positive.) Now suppose P (0) = P0 > 0 and Q(0) = Q0 > 0. It can
be shown (Exercise 10.4.42) that there’s a positive constant ρ such that if (P0 , Q0 ) is above the line L
through the origin with slope ρ, then the species with population P becomes extinct in finite time, but if
(P0 , Q0 ) is below L, the species with population Q becomes extinct in finite time. Figure 1.1.3 illustrates
this. The curves shown there are given parametrically by P = P (t), Q = Q(t), t > 0. The arrows
indicate direction along the curves with increasing t.

1.2 BASIC CONCEPTS
A differential equation is an equation that contains one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that it contains. A differential
equation is an ordinary differential equation if it involves an unknown function of only one variable, or a
partial differential equation if it involves partial derivatives of a function of more than one variable. For
now we’ll consider only ordinary differential equations, and we’ll just call them differential equations.
Throughout this text, all variables and constants are real unless it’s stated otherwise. We’ll usually use
x for the independent variable unless the independent variable is time; then we’ll use t.
The simplest differential equations are first order equations of the form
dy
= f(x)
dx

or, equivalently,

y0 = f(x),

where f is a known function of x. We already know from calculus how to find functions that satisfy this
kind of equation. For example, if

where c is an arbitrary constant. If n > 1 we can find functions y that satisfy equations of the form
y(n) = f(x)

(1.2.1)

by repeated integration. Again, this is a calculus problem.
Except for illustrative purposes in this section, there’s no need to consider differential equations like
(1.2.1).We’ll usually consider differential equations that can be written as
y(n) = f(x, y, y0 , . . . , y(n−1)),

(1.2.2)

where at least one of the functions y, y0 , . . . , y(n−1) actually appears on the right. Here are some examples:

Solutions of Differential Equations
A solution of a differential equation is a function that satisfies the differential equation on some open
interval; thus, y is a solution of (1.2.2) if y is n times differentiable and
y(n) (x) = f(x, y(x), y0 (x), . . . , y(n−1)(x))
for all x in some open interval (a, b). In this case, we also say that y is a solution of (1.2.2) on (a, b).
Functions that satisfy a differential equation at isolated points are not interesting. For example, y = x2
satisfies
xy0 + x2 = 3x
if and only if x = 0 or x = 1, but it’s not a solution of this differential equation because it does not satisfy
the equation on an open interval.
The graph of a solution of a differential equation is a solution curve. More generally, a curve C is said
to be an integral curve of a differential equation if every function y = y(x) whose graph is a segment
of C is a solution of the differential equation. Thus, any solution curve of a differential equation is an
integral curve, but an integral curve need not be a solution curve.

We leave it to you to verify that these functions both satisfy (1.2.4) on the open interval (−a, a). However,
(1.2.3) is not a solution curve of (1.2.4), since it’s not the graph of a function.

the differential equation on any open interval that contains x = 0, since y is not defined at x = 0.
Figure 1.2.1 shows the graph of (1.2.5). The part of the graph of (1.2.5) on (0, ∞) is a solution curve
of (1.2.6), as is the part of the graph on (−∞, 0).

where k1 , k2 , . . . , kn are constants. This shows that every solution of (1.2.9) has the form (1.2.10) for
some choice of the constants k1 , k2 , . . . , kn . On the other hand, differentiating (1.2.10) n times shows
that if k1 , k2 , . . . , kn are arbitrary constants, then the function y in (1.2.10) satisfies (1.2.9).

2n

where we renamed the arbitrary constants in (1.2.10) to obtain a simpler formula. As a general rule,
arbitrary constants appearing in solutions of differential equations should be simplified if possible. You’ll
see examples of this throughout the text.
Initial Value Problems
In Example 1.2.4 we saw that the differential equation y(n) = e2x has an infinite family of solutions that
depend upon the n arbitrary constants c1 , c2 , . . . , cn . In the absence of additional conditions, there’s no
reason to prefer one solution of a differential equation over another. However, we’ll often be interested
in finding a solution of a differential equation that satisfies one or more specific conditions. The next
example illustrates this.
Example 1.2.5 Find a solution of
y 0 = x3
such that y(1) = 2.
Solution At the beginning of this section we saw that the solutions of y0 = x3 are
y=

x4
+ c.
4

To determine a value of c such that y(1) = 2, we set x = 1 and y = 2 here to obtain
2 = y(1) =

1
+ c,
4

so

c=

7
.
4

Therefore the required solution is
x4 + 7
.
4
Figure 1.2.2 shows the graph of this solution. Note that imposing the condition y(1) = 2 is equivalent
to requiring the graph of y to pass through the point (1, 2).
We can rewrite the problem considered in Example 1.2.5 more briefly as
y=

y 0 = x3 ,

y(1) = 2.

We call this an initial value problem. The requirement y(1) = 2 is an initial condition. Initial value
problems can also be posed for higher order differential equations. For example,
y00 − 2y0 + 3y = ex ,

y(0) = 1,

y0 (0) = 2

(1.2.11)

12 Chapter 1 Introduction
is an initial value problem for a second order differential equation where y and y0 are required to have
specified values at x = 0. In general, an initial value problem for an n-th order differential equation
requires y and its first n − 1 derivatives to have specified values at some point x0 . These requirements are
the initial conditions.

We’ll denote an initial value problem for a differential equation by writing the initial conditions after
the equation, as in (1.2.11). For example, we would write an initial value problem for (1.2.2) as
y(n) = f(x, y, y0 , . . . , y(n−1)), y(x0 ) = k0 , y0 (x0 ) = k1 , . . . , y(n−1) = kn−1 .

(1.2.12)

Consistent with our earlier definition of a solution of the differential equation in (1.2.12), we say that y is
a solution of the initial value problem (1.2.12) if y is n times differentiable and
y(n) (x) = f(x, y(x), y0 (x), . . . , y(n−1)(x))
for all x in some open interval (a, b) that contains x0 , and y satisfies the initial conditions in (1.2.12). The
largest open interval that contains x0 on which y is defined and satisfies the differential equation is the
interval of validity of y.
Example 1.2.6 In Example 1.2.5 we saw that
y=

x4 + 7
4

(1.2.13)

is a solution of the initial value problem
y 0 = x3 ,

y(1) = 2.

Since the function in (1.2.13) is defined for all x, the interval of validity of this solution is (−∞, ∞).

the initial value problems

(1.2.15)

and
2
xy0 + y = x2 , y(−1) = − .
(1.2.16)

The interval of validity of (1.2.14) as a solution of (1.2.15) is (0, ∞), since this is the largest interval that
contains x0 = 1 on which (1.2.14) is defined. Similarly, the interval of validity of (1.2.14) as a solution of
(1.2.16) is (−∞, 0), since this is the largest interval that contains x0 = −1 on which (1.2.14) is defined.
Free Fall Under Constant Gravity
The term initial value problem originated in problems of motion where the independent variable is t
(representing elapsed time), and the initial conditions are the position and velocity of an object at the
initial (starting) time of an experiment.
Example 1.2.8 An object falls under the influence of gravity near Earth’s surface, where it can be assumed that the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity is a constant g.
(a) Construct a mathematical model for the motion of the object in the form of an initial value problem
for a second order differential equation, assuming that the altitude and velocity of the object at time
t = 0 are known. Assume that gravity is the only force acting on the object.
(b) Solve the initial value problem derived in (a) to obtain the altitude as a function of time.
S OLUTION (a) Let y(t) be the altitude of the object at time t. Since the acceleration of the object has
constant magnitude g and is in the downward (negative) direction, y satisfies the second order equation
y00 = −g,
where the prime now indicates differentiation with respect to t. If y0 and v0 denote the altitude and
velocity when t = 0, then y is a solution of the initial value problem
y00 = −g,

y(0) = y0 ,

y0 (0) = v0 .

(1.2.17)

S OLUTION (b) Integrating (1.2.17) twice yields

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = y0 and y0 (0) = v0 in these two equations shows that c1 = v0 and
c2 = y0 . Therefore the solution of the initial value problem (1.2.17) is
y=−

1.3 DIRECTION FIELDS FOR FIRST ORDER EQUATIONS
It’s impossible to find explicit formulas for solutions of some differential equations. Even if there are
such formulas, they may be so complicated that they’re useless. In this case we may resort to graphical
or numerical methods to get some idea of how the solutions of the given equation behave.
In Section 2.3 we’ll take up the question of existence of solutions of a first order equation
y0 = f(x, y).

(1.3.1)

In this section we’ll simply assume that (1.3.1) has solutions and discuss a graphical method for approximating them. In Chapter 3 we discuss numerical methods for obtaining approximate solutions of
(1.3.1).
Recall that a solution of (1.3.1) is a function y = y(x) such that
y0 (x) = f(x, y(x))
for all values of x in some interval, and an integral curve is either the graph of a solution or is made up
of segments that are graphs of solutions. Therefore, not being able to solve (1.3.1) is equivalent to not
knowing the equations of integral curves of (1.3.1). However, it’s easy to calculate the slopes of these
curves. To be specific, the slope of an integral curve of (1.3.1) through a given point (x0 , y0 ) is given by
the number f(x0 , y0 ). This is the basis of the method of direction fields.
If f is defined on a set R, we can construct a direction field for (1.3.1) in R by drawing a short line
segment through each point (x, y) in R with slope f(x, y). Of course, as a practical matter, we can’t
actually draw line segments through every point in R; rather, we must select a finite set of points in R.
For example, suppose f is defined on the closed rectangular region
R : {a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d}.
Let
a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xm = b
be equally spaced points in [a, b] and
c = y0 < y1 < · · · < yn = d
be equally spaced points in [c, d]. We say that the points
(xi , yj ),

0 ≤ i ≤ m,

0 ≤ j ≤ n,

form a rectangular grid (Figure 1.3.1). Through each point in the grid we draw a short line segment with
slope f(xi , yj ). The result is an approximation to a direction field for (1.3.1) in R. If the grid points are
sufficiently numerous and close together, we can draw approximate integral curves of (1.3.1) by drawing
curves through points in the grid tangent to the line segments associated with the points in the grid.

Unfortunately, approximating a direction field and graphing integral curves in this way is too tedious
to be done effectively by hand. However, there is software for doing this. As you’ll see, the combination of direction fields and integral curves gives useful insights into the behavior of the solutions of the
differential equation even if we can’t obtain exact solutions.
We’ll study numerical methods for solving a single first order equation (1.3.1) in Chapter 3. These
methods can be used to plot solution curves of (1.3.1) in a rectangular region R if f is continuous on R.

The methods of Chapter 3 won’t work for the equation
y0 = −x/y

if R contains part of the x-axis, since f(x, y) = −x/y is undefined when y = 0. Similarly, they won’t
work for the equation

y0 =
(1.3.3)
1 − x2 − y 2

if R contains any part of the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1, because the right side of (1.3.3) is undefined if
x2 + y2 = 1. However, (1.3.2) and (1.3.3) can written as
y0 =

A(x, y)
B(x, y)

(1.3.4)

where A and B are continuous on any rectangle R. Because of this, some differential equation software
is based on numerically solving pairs of equations of the form

top and bottom are solution curves. However, the integral curves near the middle are more complicated.
For example, Figure 1.3.7 shows the integral curve through the origin. The vertices of the dashed rectangle
are on the circle x2 + y2 = 1 (a ≈ .846, b ≈ .533), where all integral curves of (1.3.3) have infinite
slope. There are three solution curves of (1.3.3) on the integral curve in the figure: the segment above the
level y = b is the graph of a solution on (−∞, a), the segment below the level y = −b is the graph of a
solution on (−a, ∞), and the segment between these two levels is the graph of a solution on (−a, a).
USING TECHNOLOGY

20 Chapter 1 Introduction
As you study from this book, you’ll often be asked to use computer software and graphics. Exercises
with this intent are marked as C (computer or calculator required), C/G (computer and/or graphics
required), or L (laboratory work requiring software and/or graphics). Often you may not completely
understand how the software does what it does. This is similar to the situation most people are in when
they drive automobiles or watch television, and it doesn’t decrease the value of using modern technology
as an aid to learning. Just be careful that you use the technology as a supplement to thought rather than a
substitute for it.

CHAPTER 2
First Order Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we study first order equations for which there are general methods of solution.
SECTION 2.1 deals with linear equations, the simplest kind of first order equations. In this section we
introduce the method of variation of parameters. The idea underlying this method will be a unifying
theme for our approach to solving many different kinds of differential equations throughout the book.
SECTION 2.2 deals with separable equations, the simplest nonlinear equations. In this section we introduce the idea of implicit and constant solutions of differential equations, and we point out some differences between the properties of linear and nonlinear equations.
SECTION 2.3 discusses existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonlinear equations. Although it may
seem logical to place this section before Section 2.2, we presented Section 2.2 first so we could have
illustrative examples in Section 2.3.
SECTION 2.4 deals with nonlinear equations that are not separable, but can be transformed into separable
equations by a procedure similar to variation of parameters.
SECTION 2.5 covers exact differential equations, which are given this name because the method for
solving them uses the idea of an exact differential from calculus.
SECTION 2.6 deals with equations that are not exact, but can made exact by multiplying them by a
function known called integrating factor.

30 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
2.1 LINEAR FIRST ORDER EQUATIONS
A first order differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written as
y0 + p(x)y = f(x).

(2.1.1)

A first order differential equation that can’t be written like this is nonlinear. We say that (2.1.1) is
homogeneous if f ≡ 0; otherwise it’s nonhomogeneous. Since y ≡ 0 is obviously a solution of the
homgeneous equation
y0 + p(x)y = 0,
we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is nontrivial.
Example 2.1.1 The first order equations

General Solution of a Linear First Order Equation
To motivate a definition that we’ll need, consider the simple linear first order equation
y0 =

1
.
x2

(2.1.2)

From calculus we know that y satisfies this equation if and only if
y=−

1
+ c,
x

(2.1.3)

where c is an arbitrary constant. We call c a parameter and say that (2.1.3) defines a one–parameter
family of functions. For each real number c, the function defined by (2.1.3) is a solution of (2.1.2) on

Section 2.1 Linear First Order Equations

31

(−∞, 0) and (0, ∞); moreover, every solution of (2.1.2) on either of these intervals is of the form (2.1.3)
for some choice of c. We say that (2.1.3) is the general solution of (2.1.2).
We’ll see that a similar situation occurs in connection with any first order linear equation
y0 + p(x)y = f(x);

(2.1.4)

that is, if p and f are continuous on some open interval (a, b) then there’s a unique formula y = y(x, c)
analogous to (2.1.3) that involves x and a parameter c and has the these properties:
• For each fixed value of c, the resulting function of x is a solution of (2.1.4) on (a, b).
• If y is a solution of (2.1.4) on (a, b), then y can be obtained from the formula by choosing c
appropriately.
We’ll call y = y(x, c) the general solution of (2.1.4).
When this has been established, it will follow that an equation of the form
P0 (x)y0 + P1 (x)y = F (x)

(2.1.5)

has a general solution on any open interval (a, b) on which P0 , P1 , and F are all continuous and P0 has
no zeros, since in this case we can rewrite (2.1.5) in the form (2.1.4) with p = P1 /P0 and f = F/P0 ,
which are both continuous on (a, b).
To avoid awkward wording in examples and exercises, we won’t specify the interval (a, b) when we
ask for the general solution of a specific linear first order equation. Let’s agree that this always means
that we want the general solution on every open interval on which p and f are continuous if the equation
is of the form (2.1.4), or on which P0 , P1 , and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros, if the equation is of
the form (2.1.5). We leave it to you to identify these intervals in specific examples and exercises.
For completeness, we point out that if P0 , P1 , and F are all continuous on an open interval (a, b), but
P0 does have a zero in (a, b), then (2.1.5) may fail to have a general solution on (a, b) in the sense just
defined. Since this isn’t a major point that needs to be developed in depth, we won’t discuss it further;
however, see Exercise 44 for an example.
Homogeneous Linear First Order Equations
We begin with the problem of finding the general solution of a homogeneous linear first order equation.
The next example recalls a familiar result from calculus.
Example 2.1.3 Let a be a constant.
(a) Find the general solution of
y0 − ay = 0.

(2.1.6)

(b) Solve the initial value problem
y0 − ay = 0,

y(x0 ) = y0 .

S OLUTION (a) You already know from calculus that if c is any constant, then y = ceax satisfies (2.1.6).
However, let’s pretend you’ve forgotten this, and use this problem to illustrate a general method for
solving a homogeneous linear first order equation.
We know that (2.1.6) has the trivial solution y ≡ 0. Now suppose y is a nontrivial solution of (2.1.6).
Then, since a differentiable function must be continuous, there must be some open interval I on which y
has no zeros. We rewrite (2.1.6) as
y0

Figure 2.1.1 Solutions of y0 − ay = 0, y(0) = 1
for x in I. Integrating this shows that
ln |y| = ax + k,

so

|y| = ek eax ,

where k is an arbitrary constant. Since eax can never equal zero, y has no zeros, so y is either always
positive or always negative. Therefore we can rewrite y as
y = ceax
where
c=



ek
−ek

(2.1.7)

if y > 0,
if y < 0.

This shows that every nontrivial solution of (2.1.6) is of the form y = ceax for some nonzero constant c.
Since setting c = 0 yields the trivial solution, all solutions of (2.1.6) are of the form (2.1.7). Conversely,
(2.1.7) is a solution of (2.1.6) for every choice of c, since differentiating (2.1.7) yields y0 = aceax = ay.
S OLUTION (b) Imposing the initial condition y(x0 ) = y0 yields y0 = ceax0 , so c = y0 e−ax0 and
y = y0 e−ax0 eax = y0 ea(x−x0 ) .
Figure 2.1.1 show the graphs of this function with x0 = 0, y0 = 1, and various values of a.

(b) Solve the initial value problem

S OLUTION (a) We rewrite (2.1.8) as

1
y = 0,
(2.1.10)
x
where x is restricted to either (−∞, 0) or (0, ∞). If y is a nontrivial solution of (2.1.10), there must be
some open interval I on which y has no zeros. We can rewrite (2.1.10) as
y0 +

y0
1
=−
y
x
for x in I. Integrating shows that
ln |y| = − ln |x| + k,

so

|y| =

ek

|x|

Since a function that satisfies the last equation can’t change sign on either (−∞, 0) or (0, ∞), we can
rewrite this result more simply as
c
(2.1.11)
y=
x
where

ek if y > 0,
c=
−ek if y < 0.
We’ve now shown that every solution of (2.1.10) is given by (2.1.11) for some choice of c. (Even though
we assumed that y was nontrivial to derive (2.1.11), we can get the trivial solution by setting c = 0 in
(2.1.11).) Conversely, any function of the form (2.1.11) is a solution of (2.1.10), since differentiating
(2.1.11) yields

The interval of validity of this solution is (0, ∞).
The results in Examples 2.1.3(a) and 2.1.4(b) are special cases of the next theorem.
Theorem 2.1.1 If p is continuous on (a, b), then the general solution of the homogeneous equation
y0 + p(x)y = 0

(2.1.12)

on (a, b) is
y = ce−P (x) ,
where
P (x) =

Figure 2.1.2 Solutions of xy0 + y = 0 on (0, ∞) and (−∞, 0)
Proof

If y = ce−P (x) , differentiating y and using (2.1.14) shows that
y0 = −P 0 (x)ce−P (x) = −p(x)ce−P (x) = −p(x)y,

so y0 + p(x)y = 0; that is, y is a solution of (2.1.12), for any choice of c.
Now we’ll show that any solution of (2.1.12) can be written as y = ce−P (x) for some constant c. The
trivial solution can be written this way, with c = 0. Now suppose y is a nontrivial solution. Then there’s
an open subinterval I of (a, b) on which y has no zeros. We can rewrite (2.1.12) as
y0
= −p(x)
y

(2.1.15)

for x in I. Integrating (2.1.15) and recalling (2.1.13) yields
ln |y| = −P (x) + k,
where k is a constant. This implies that
|y| = ek e−P (x) .
Since P is defined for all x in (a, b) and an exponential can never equal zero, we can take I = (a, b), so
y has zeros on (a, b) (a, b), so we can rewrite the last equation as y = ce−P (x) , where

ek if y > 0 on (a, b),
c=
−ek if y < 0 on (a, b).
R EMARK: Rewriting a first order differential equation so that one side depends only on y and y0 and the
other depends only on x is called separation of variables. We did this in Examples 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, and
in rewriting (2.1.12) as (2.1.15).We’llapply this method to nonlinear equations in Section 2.2.

Section 2.1 Linear First Order Equations

35

Linear Nonhomogeneous First Order Equations
We’ll now solve the nonhomogeneous equation
y0 + p(x)y = f(x).

(2.1.16)

When considering this equation we call
y0 + p(x)y = 0
the complementary equation.
We’ll find solutions of (2.1.16) in the form y = uy1 , where y1 is a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation and u is to be determined. This method of using a solution of the complementary
equation to obtain solutions of a nonhomogeneous equation is a special case of a method called variation
of parameters, which you’ll encounter several times in this book. (Obviously, u can’t be constant, since
if it were, the left side of (2.1.16) would be zero. Recognizing this, the early users of this method viewed
u as a “parameter” that varies; hence, the name “variation of parameters.”)
If
y = uy1 , then y0 = u0 y1 + uy10 .
Substituting these expressions for y and y0 into (2.1.16) yields
u0 y1 + u(y10 + p(x)y1 ) = f(x),
which reduces to
u0 y1 = f(x),

(2.1.17)

since y1 is a solution of the complementary equation; that is,
y10 + p(x)y1 = 0.
In the proof of Theorem 2.2.1 we saw that y1 has no zeros on an interval where p is continuous. Therefore
we can divide (2.1.17) through by y1 to obtain
u0 = f(x)/y1 (x).
We can integrate this (introducing a constant of integration), and multiply the result by y1 to get the general solution of (2.1.16). Before turning to the formal proof of this claim, let’s consider some examples.
Example 2.1.5 Find the general solution of
y0 + 2y = x3 e−2x.

(2.1.18)

By applying (a) of Example 2.1.3 with a = −2, we see that y1 = e−2x is a solution of the complementary equation y0 + 2y = 0. Therefore we seek solutions of (2.1.18) in the form y = ue−2x , so
that
y0 = u0 e−2x − 2ue−2x

and

y0 + 2y = u0 e−2x − 2ue−2x + 2ue−2x = u0 e−2x .

Therefore y is a solution of (2.1.18) if and only if
u0 e−2x = x3 e−2x

or, equivalently, u0 = x3 .

Therefore
u=

38 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
R EMARK: It wasn’t necessary to do the computations (2.1.23) and (2.1.24) in Example 2.1.6, since we
showed in the discussion preceding Example 2.1.5 that if y = uy1 where y10 + p(x)y1 = 0, then y0 +
p(x)y = u0 y1 . We did these computations so you would see this happen in this specific example. We
recommend that you include these “unnecesary” computations in doing exercises, until you’re confident
that you really understand the method. After that, omit them.
We summarize the method of variation of parameters for solving
y0 + p(x)y = f(x)

(2.1.26)

as follows:
(a) Find a function y1 such that

y10
= −p(x).
y1

For convenience, take the constant of integration to be zero.
(b) Write
y = uy1

(2.1.27)

to remind yourself of what you’re doing.
(c) Write u0 y1 = f and solve for u0 ; thus, u0 = f/y1 .
(d) Integrate u0 to obtain u, with an arbitrary constant of integration.
(e) Substitute u into (2.1.27) to obtain y.
To solve an equation written as
P0 (x)y0 + P1 (x)y = F (x),
we recommend that you divide through by P0 (x) to obtain an equation of the form (2.1.26) and then
follow this procedure.
Solutions in Integral Form
Sometimes the integrals that arise in solving a linear first order equation can’t be evaluated in terms of
elementary functions. In this case the solution must be left in terms of an integral.
Example 2.1.7
(a) Find the general solution of
y0 − 2xy = 1.
(b) Solve the initial value problem
y0 − 2xy = 1,

y(0) = y0 .

(2.1.28)

S OLUTION (a) To apply variation of parameters, we need a nontrivial solution y1 of the complementary
equation; thus, y10 − 2xy1 = 0, which we rewrite as

An Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
The method of variation of parameters leads to this theorem.
Theorem 2.1.2 Suppose p and f are continuous on an open interval (a, b), and let y1 be any nontrivial
solution of the complementary equation
y0 + p(x)y = 0
on (a, b). Then:

on (a, b).
Proof (a) To show that (2.1.32) is the general solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b), we must prove that:
(i) If c is any constant, the function y in (2.1.32) is a solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b).
(ii) If y is a solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b) then y is of the form (2.1.32) for some constant c.
To prove (i), we first observe that any function of the form (2.1.32) is defined on (a, b), since p and f
are continuous on (a, b). Differentiating (2.1.32) yields


Z
y0 = y10 (x) c + f(x)/y1 (x) dx + f(x).
Since y10 = −p(x)y1 , this and (2.1.32) imply that

y = −p(x)y1 (x) c + f(x)/y1 (x) dx + f(x)
=

−p(x)y(x) + f(x),

which implies that y is a solution of (2.1.31).
To prove (ii), suppose y is a solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b). From the proof of Theorem 2.1.1, we know
that y1 has no zeros on (a, b), so the function u = y/y1 is defined on (a, b). Moreover, since

it’s convenient to choose the antiderivative that equals zero when x = x0 , and write the general solution

2.2 SEPARABLE EQUATIONS
A first order differential equation is separable if it can be written as
h(y)y0 = g(x),

(2.2.1)

where the left side is a product of y0 and a function of y and the right side is a function of x. Rewriting
a separable differential equation in this form is called separation of variables. In Section 2.1 we used
separation of variables to solve homogeneous linear equations. In this section we’ll apply this method to
nonlinear equations.
To see how to solve (2.2.1), let’s first assume that y is a solution. Let G(x) and H(y) be antiderivatives
of g(x) and h(y); that is,
H 0 (y) = h(y) and G0 (x) = g(x).
(2.2.2)
Then, from the chain rule,
d
H(y(x)) = H 0 (y(x))y0 (x) = h(y)y0 (x).
dx
Therefore (2.2.1) is equivalent to
d
d
H(y(x)) =
G(x).
dx
dx
Integrating both sides of this equation and combining the constants of integration yields
H(y(x)) = G(x) + c.

(2.2.3)

Although we derived this equation on the assumption that y is a solution of (2.2.1), we can now view it
differently: Any differentiable function y that satisfies (2.2.3) for some constant c is a solution of (2.2.1).
To see this, we differentiate both sides of (2.2.3), using the chain rule on the left, to obtain
H 0 (y(x))y0 (x) = G0 (x),
which is equivalent to
h(y(x))y0 (x) = g(x)
because of (2.2.2).
In conclusion, to solve (2.2.1) it suffices to find functions G = G(x) and H = H(y) that satisfy
(2.2.2). Then any differentiable function y = y(x) that satisfies (2.2.3) is a solution of (2.2.1).

The last equation shows that c must be positive if y is to be a solution of (2.2.4) on an open interval.
Therefore we let 2c = a2 (with a > 0) and rewrite the last equation as
x 2 + y 2 = a2 .
This equation has two differentiable solutions for y in terms of x:

Implicit Solutions of Separable Equations
In Examples 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 we were able to solve the equation H(y) = G(x) + c to obtain explicit
formulas for solutions of the given separable differential equations. As we’ll see in the next example,
this isn’t always possible. In this situation we must broaden our definition of a solution of a separable
equation. The next theorem provides the basis for this modification. We omit the proof, which requires a
result from advanced calculus called as the implicit function theorem.
Theorem 2.2.1 Suppose g = g(x) is continous on (a, b) and h = h(y) are continuous on (c, d). Let G
be an antiderivative of g on (a, b) and let H be an antiderivative of h on (c, d). Let x0 be an arbitrary
point in (a, b), let y0 be a point in (c, d) such that h(y0 ) 6= 0, and define
c = H(y0 ) − G(x0 ).

(2.2.10)

Then there’s a function y = y(x) defined on some open interval (a1 , b1 ), where a ≤ a1 < x0 < b1 ≤ b,
such that y(x0 ) = y0 and
H(y) = G(x) + c
(2.2.11)
for a1 < x < b1 . Therefore y is a solution of the initial value problem
h(y)y0 = g(x),

y(x0 ) = x0 .

(2.2.12)

It’s convenient to say that (2.2.11) with c arbitrary is an implicit solution of h(y)y0 = g(x). Curves
defined by (2.2.11) are integral curves of h(y)y0 = g(x). If c satisfies (2.2.10), we’ll say that (2.2.11) is
an implicit solution of the initial value problem (2.2.12). However, keep these points in mind:
• For some choices of c there may not be any differentiable functions y that satisfy (2.2.11).

Therefore

satisfies the initial condition y(1) = 2.

Constant Solutions of Separable Equations
An equation of the form
y0 = g(x)p(y)
is separable, since it can be rewritten as
1 0
y = g(x).
p(y)
However, the division by p(y) is not legitimate if p(y) = 0 for some values of y. The next two examples
show how to deal with this problem.
Example 2.2.4 Find all solutions of
y0 = 2xy2 .

(2.2.16)

Solution Here we must divide by p(y) = y2 to separate variables. This isn’t legitimate if y is a solution
of (2.2.16) that equals zero for some value of x. One such solution can be found by inspection: y ≡ 0.
Now suppose y is a solution of (2.2.16) that isn’t identically zero. Since y is continuous there must be an
interval on which y is never zero. Since division by y2 is legitimate for x in this interval, we can separate
variables in (2.2.16) to obtain

We’ve now shown that if y is a solution of (2.2.16) that is not identically zero, then y must be of the
form (2.2.17). By substituting (2.2.17) into (2.2.16), you can verify that (2.2.17) is a solution of (2.2.16).
Thus, solutions of (2.2.16) are y ≡ 0 and the functions of the form (2.2.17). Note that the solution y ≡ 0

y ≡ 1 and y ≡ −1. Now suppose y is a solution of (2.2.18) such that 1 − y2 isn’t identically zero. Since
1 − y2 is continuous there must be an interval on which 1 − y2 is never zero. Since division by 1 − y2 is
legitimate for x in this interval, we can separate variables in (2.2.18) to obtain

Thus, the solutions of (2.2.18) are y ≡ 1, y ≡ −1 and the functions of the form (2.2.19). Note that the

Differences Between Linear and Nonlinear Equations
Theorem 2.1.2 states that if p and f are continuous on (a, b) then every solution of
y0 + p(x)y = f(x)
on (a, b) can be obtained by choosing a value for the constant c in the general solution, and if x0 is any
point in (a, b) and y0 is arbitrary, then the initial value problem
y0 + p(x)y = f(x),

y(x0 ) = y0

has a solution on (a, b).
The not true for nonlinear equations. First, we saw in Examples 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 that a nonlinear
equation may have solutions that can’t be obtained by choosing a specific value of a constant appearing
in a one-parameter family of solutions. Second, it is in general impossible to determine the interval
of validity of a solution to an initial value problem for a nonlinear equation by simply examining the
equation, since the interval of validity may depend on the initial condition. For instance, in Example 2.2.2
we saw that the solution of
dy

is valid on (−a, a), where a = x20 + y02 .

The population P = P (t) of a species satisfies the logistic equation
P 0 = aP (1 − αP )

and P (0) = P0 > 0. Find P for t > 0, and find limt→∞ P (t).
29.

An epidemic spreads through a population at a rate proportional to the product of the number of
people already infected and the number of people susceptible, but not yet infected. Therefore, if
S denotes the total population of susceptible people and I = I(t) denotes the number of infected
people at time t, then
I 0 = rI(S − I),

where r is a positive constant. Assuming that I(0) = I0 , find I(t) for t > 0, and show that
limt→∞ I(t) = S.
30.

L The result of Exercise 29 is discouraging: if any susceptible member of the group is initially
infected, then in the long run all susceptible members are infected! On a more hopeful note,
suppose the disease spreads according to the model of Exercise 29, but there’s a medication that
cures the infected population at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals. Now the
equation for the number of infected individuals becomes
I 0 = rI(S − I) − qI
where q is a positive constant.

(A)

54 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
(a) Choose r and S positive. By plotting direction fields and solutions of (A) on suitable rectangular grids
R = {0 ≤ t ≤ T, 0 ≤ I ≤ d}

in the (t, I)-plane, verify that if I is any solution of (A) such that I(0) > 0, then limt→∞ I(t) =
S − q/r if q < rS and limt→∞ I(t) = 0 if q ≥ rS.
(b) To verify the experimental results of (a), use separation of variables to solve (A) with initial
condition I(0) = I0 > 0, and find limt→∞ I(t). H INT: There are three cases to consider:
(i) q < rS; (ii) q > rS; (iii) q = rS.
31.

L Consider the differential equation
y0 = ay − by2 − q,

(A)

where a, b are positive constants, and q is an arbitrary constant. Suppose y denotes a solution of
this equation that satisfies the initial condition y(0) = y0 .
(a) Choose a and b positive and q < a2 /4b. By plotting direction fields and solutions of (A) on
suitable rectangular grids
R = {0 ≤ t ≤ T, c ≤ y ≤ d}
(B)

in the (t, y)-plane, discover that there are numbers y1 and y2 with y1 < y2 such that if
y0 > y1 then limt→∞ y(t) = y2 , and if y0 < y1 then y(t) = −∞ for some finite value of t.
(What happens if y0 = y1 ?)
(b) Choose a and b positive and q = a2 /4b. By plotting direction fields and solutions of (A)
on suitable rectangular grids of the form (B), discover that there’s a number y1 such that if
y0 ≥ y1 then limt→∞ y(t) = y1 , while if y0 < y1 then y(t) = −∞ for some finite value of
t.
(c) Choose positive a, b and q > a2 /4b. By plotting direction fields and solutions of (A) on
suitable rectangular grids of the form (B), discover that no matter what y0 is, y(t) = −∞ for
some finite value of t.
(d) Verify your results experiments analytically. Start by separating variables in (A) to obtain
y0
= 1.
ay − by2 − q

To decide what to do next you’ll have to use the quadratic formula. This should lead you to
see why there are three cases. Take it from there!
Because of its role in the transition between these three cases, q0 = a2 /4b is called a bifurcation value of q. In general, if q is a parameter in any differential equation, q0 is said to be a
bifurcation value of q if the nature of the solutions of the equation with q < q0 is qualitatively
different from the nature of the solutions with q > q0 .
32.

L By plotting direction fields and solutions of
y0 = qy − y3 ,
convince yourself that q0 = 0 is a bifurcation value of q for this equation. Explain what makes
you draw this conclusion.

33.

Suppose a disease spreads according to the model of Exercise 29, but there’s a medication that
cures the infected population at a constant rate of q individuals per unit time, where q > 0. Then
the equation for the number of infected individuals becomes
I 0 = rI(S − I) − q.
Assuming that I(0) = I0 > 0, use the results of Exercise 31 to describe what happens as t → ∞.

2.3 EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTIONS OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS
Although there are methods for solving some nonlinear equations, it’s impossible to find useful formulas
for the solutions of most. Whether we’re looking for exact solutions or numerical approximations, it’s
useful to know conditions that imply the existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value problems
for nonlinear equations. In this section we state such a condition and illustrate it with examples.

Figure 2.3.1 An open rectangle

56 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
Some terminology: an open rectangle R is a set of points (x, y) such that
a < x < b and

c<y<d

(Figure 2.3.1). We’ll denote this set by R : {a < x < b, c < y < d}. “Open” means that the boundary
rectangle (indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 2.3.1) isn’t included in R .
The next theorem gives sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value
problems for first order nonlinear differential equations. We omit the proof, which is beyond the scope of
this book.
Theorem 2.3.1
(a) If f is continuous on an open rectangle
R : {a < x < b, c < y < d}
that contains (x0 , y0 ) then the initial value problem
y0 = f(x, y),

y(x0 ) = y0

(2.3.1)

has at least one solution on some open subinterval of (a, b) that contains x0 .
(b) If both f and fy are continuous on R then (2.3.1) has a unique solution on some open subinterval
of (a, b) that contains x0 .
It’s important to understand exactly what Theorem 2.3.1 says.
• (a) is an existence theorem. It guarantees that a solution exists on some open interval that contains
x0 , but provides no information on how to find the solution, or to determine the open interval on
which it exists. Moreover, (a) provides no information on the number of solutions that (2.3.1) may
have. It leaves open the possibility that (2.3.1) may have two or more solutions that differ for values
of x arbitrarily close to x0 . We will see in Example 2.3.6 that this can happen.
• (b) is a uniqueness theorem. It guarantees that (2.3.1) has a unique solution on some open interval
(a,b) that contains x0 . However, if (a, b) 6= (−∞, ∞), (2.3.1) may have more than one solution on
a larger interval that contains (a, b). For example, it may happen that b < ∞ and all solutions have
the same values on (a, b), but two solutions y1 and y2 are defined on some interval (a, b1 ) with
b1 > b, and have different values for b < x < b1 ; thus, the graphs of the y1 and y2 “branch off” in
different directions at x = b. (See Example 2.3.7 and Figure 2.3.3). In this case, continuity implies
that y1 (b) = y2 (b) (call their common value y), and y1 and y2 are both solutions of the initial value
problem
y0 = f(x, y), y(b) = y
(2.3.2)
that differ on every open interval that contains b. Therefore f or fy must have a discontinuity at
some point in each open rectangle that contains (b, y), since if this were not so, (2.3.2) would have
a unique solution on some open interval that contains b. We leave it to you to give a similar analysis
of the case where a > −∞.

are continuous for all (x, y), Theorem 2.3.1 implies that if (x0 , y0 ) is arbitrary, then (2.3.3) has a unique

(x0 , y0 ) that does not contain (0, 0). Since f and fy are continuous on R, Theorem 2.3.1 implies that if
(x0 , y0 ) 6= (0, 0) then (2.3.4) has a unique solution on some open interval that contains x0 .

that if y0 6= x0 , (2.3.5) has a unique solution on some open interval that contains x0 .

y=−

x2

Solution We’ll obtain a contradiction by assuming that (2.3.6) has a solution y1 that equals zero for some
value of x, but isn’t identically zero. If y1 has this property, there’s a point x0 such that y1 (x0 ) = 0, but
y1 (x) 6= 0 for some value of x in every open interval that contains x0 . This means that the initial value
problem
y0 = 2xy2 , y(x0 ) = 0
(2.3.7)
has two solutions y ≡ 0 and y = y1 that differ for some value of x on every open interval that contains
x0 . This contradicts Theorem 2.3.1(b), since in (2.3.6) the functions
f(x, y) = 2xy2

and

fy (x, y) = 4xy.

are both continuous for all (x, y), which implies that (2.3.7) has a unique solution on some open interval
that contains x0 .

that contains x0 .
If y = 0 then fy (x, y) is undefined, and therefore discontinuous; hence, Theorem 2.3.1 does not apply
to (2.3.8) if y0 = 0.

3

(2.3.10)

Since y ≡ 0 satisfies the initial condition y(0) = 0, it’s a solution of (2.3.9).
Now suppose y is a solution of (2.3.10) that isn’t identically zero. Separating variables in (2.3.10)

Since we divided by y to separate variables in (2.3.10), our derivation of (2.3.11) is legitimate only on
open intervals where y has no zeros. However, (2.3.11) actually defines y for all x, and differentiating
(2.3.11) shows that

Therefore (2.3.11) satisfies (2.3.10) on (−∞, ∞) even if c ≤ 0, so that y( |c|) = y(− |c|) = 0. In
particular, taking c = 0 in (2.3.11) yields
y = x10/3
as a second solution of (2.3.9). Both solutions are defined on (−∞, ∞), and they differ on every open
interval that contains x0 = 0 (see Figure 2.3.2.) In fact, there are four distinct solutions of (2.3.9) defined
on (−∞, ∞) that differ from each other on every open interval that contains x0 = 0. Can you identify
the other two?

Solution Let y be any solution of (2.3.12). Because of the initial condition y(0) = −1 and the continuity
of y, there’s an open interval I that contains x0 = 0 on which y has no zeros, and is consequently of the
form (2.3.11). Setting x = 0 and y = −1 in (2.3.11) yields c = −1, so
y = (x2 − 1)5/3

that is, (2.3.13) is the unique solution of (2.3.12) on (−1, 1). This is the largest open interval on which
(2.3.12) has a unique solution. To see this, note that (2.3.13) is a solution of (2.3.12) on (−∞, ∞). From

2.4 TRANSFORMATION OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS INTO SEPARABLE EQUATIONS
In Section 2.1 we found that the solutions of a linear nonhomogeneous equation
y0 + p(x)y = f(x)

Section 2.4 Transformation of Nonlinear Equations into Separable Equations

63

are of the form y = uy1 , where y1 is a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation
y0 + p(x)y = 0

(2.4.1)

and u is a solution of
u0 y1 (x) = f(x).
Note that this last equation is separable, since it can be rewritten as
u0 =

f(x)
.
y1 (x)

In this section we’ll consider nonlinear differential equations that are not separable to begin with, but can
be solved in a similar fashion by writing their solutions in the form y = uy1 , where y1 is a suitably chosen
known function and u satisfies a separable equation. We’llsay in this case that we transformed the given
equation into a separable equation.
Bernoulli Equations
A Bernoulli equation is an equation of the form
y0 + p(x)y = f(x)yr ,

(2.4.2)

where r can be any real number other than 0 or 1. (Note that (2.4.2) is linear if and only if r = 0 or
r = 1.) We can transform (2.4.2) into a separable equation by variation of parameters: if y1 is a nontrivial
solution of (2.4.1), substituting y = uy1 into (2.4.2) yields
u0 y1 + u(y10 + p(x)y1 ) = f(x)(uy1 )r ,
which is equivalent to the separable equation
r

u0 y1 (x) = f(x) (y1 (x)) ur

or

u0
r−1
= f(x) (y1 (x))
,
ur

since y10 + p(x)y1 = 0.
Example 2.4.1 Solve the Bernoulli equation
y0 − y = xy2 .

(2.4.3)

Solution Since y1 = ex is a solution of y0 − y = 0, we look for solutions of (2.4.3) in the form y = uex ,
where
u0 ex = xu2 e2x or, equivalently, u0 = xu2 ex .
Separating variables yields
u0

Other Nonlinear Equations That Can be Transformed Into Separable Equations
We’ve seen that the nonlinear Bernoulli equation can be transformed into a separable equation by the
substitution y = uy1 if y1 is suitably chosen. Now let’s discover a sufficient condition for a nonlinear
first order differential equation
y0 = f(x, y)
(2.4.4)
to be transformable into a separable equation in the same way. Substituting y = uy1 into (2.4.4) yields
u0 y1 (x) + uy10 (x) = f(x, uy1 (x)),
which is equivalent to
If

u0 y1 (x) = f(x, uy1 (x)) − uy10 (x).

(2.4.5)

f(x, uy1 (x)) = q(u)y10 (x)
for some function q, then (2.4.5) becomes
u0 y1 (x) = (q(u) − u)y10 (x),

(2.4.6)

which is separable. After checking for constant solutions u ≡ u0 such that q(u0 ) = u0 , we can separate
variables to obtain
u0

Homogeneous Nonlinear Equations
In the text we’ll consider only the most widely studied class of equations for which the method of the
preceding paragraph works. Other types of equations appear in Exercises 44–51.
The differential equation (2.4.4) is said to be homogeneous if x and y occur in f in such a way that
f(x, y) depends only on the ratio y/x; that is, (2.4.4) can be written as
y0 = q(y/x),

(2.4.7)

where q = q(u) is a function of a single variable. For example,
y0 =
and
y0 =
are of the form (2.4.7), with

y + xe−y/x
y
= + e−y/x

 y 2 y
y2 + xy − x2

q(u) = u + e−u

and

q(u) = u2 + u − 1,

respectively. The general method discussed above can be applied to (2.4.7) with y1 = x (and therefore
y10 = 1). Thus, substituting y = ux in (2.4.7) yields
u0 x + u = q(u),
and separation of variables (after checking for constant solutions u ≡ u0 such that q(u0 ) = u0 ) yields
u0
1
= .
q(u) − u
x
Before turning to examples, we point out something that you may’ve have already noticed: the definition of homogeneous equation given here isn’t the same as the definition given in Section 2.1, where we
said that a linear equation of the form
y0 + p(x)y = 0
is homogeneous. We make no apology for this inconsistency, since we didn’t create it historically, homogeneous has been used in these two inconsistent ways. The one having to do with linear equations is the
most important. This is the only section of the book where the meaning defined here will apply.
Since y/x is in general undefined if x = 0, we’ll consider solutions of nonhomogeneous equations
only on open intervals that do not contain the point x = 0.
Example 2.4.2 Solve
y0 =

y + xe−y/x
.
x

Solution Substituting y = ux into (2.4.8) yields
u0 x + u =

(2.4.8)

66 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
Integrating yields eu = ln |x| + c. Therefore u = ln(ln |x| + c) and y = ux = x ln(ln |x| + c).

rewrite (2.4.9) as
y2 + xy − x2

u0 x + u =

The situation is more complicated if x = 0 is the open interval. First, note that y = −x satisfies (2.4.9)
on (−∞, ∞). If c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, the function

We leave it to you to verify this. To do so, note that if y is any function of the form (2.4.13) then y(0) = 0
and y0 (0) = 1.
Figure 2.4.3 shows a direction field and some integral curves for (2.4.9).

S OLUTION (b) We could obtain c by imposing the initial condition y(1) = 2 in (2.4.13), and then solving
for c. However, it’s easier to use (2.4.12). Since u = y/x, the initial condition y(1) = 2 implies that
u(1) = 2. Substituting this into (2.4.12) yields c = 1/3. Hence, the solution of (2.4.10) is

The interval of validity of this

shows several solutions of the initial value problem (2.4.10). Note that these solutions
coincide on (0, 3).

You may have noticed that the logistic equation
P 0 = aP (1 − αP )
from Verhulst’s model for population growth can be written in Bernoulli form as
P 0 − aP = −aαP 2 .
This isn’t particularly interesting, since the logistic equation is separable, and therefore solvable
by the method studied in Section 2.2. So let’s consider a more complicated model, where a is
a positive constant and α is a positive continuous function of t on [0, ∞). The equation for this
model is
P 0 − aP = −aα(t)P 2 ,
a non-separable Bernoulli equation.

2.5 EXACT EQUATIONS
In this section it’s convenient to write first order differential equations in the form
M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0.

(2.5.1)

This equation can be interpreted as
M (x, y) + N (x, y)

dy
= 0,
dx

(2.5.2)

where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable, or as
M (x, y)

dx
+ N (x, y) = 0,
dy

(2.5.3)

where y is the independent variable and x is the dependent variable. Since the solutions of (2.5.2) and
(2.5.3) will often have to be left in implicit, form we’ll say that F (x, y) = c is an implicit solution of
(2.5.1) if every differentiable function y = y(x) that satisfies F (x, y) = c is a solution of (2.5.2) and
every differentiable function x = x(y) that satisfies F (x, y) = c is a solution of (2.5.3).
Here are some examples:
Equation (2.5.1)

Note that a separable equation can be written as (2.5.1) as
M (x) dx + N (y) dy = 0.
We’ll develop a method for solving (2.5.1) under appropriate assumptions on M and N . This method
is an extension of the method of separation of variables (Exercise 41). Before stating it we consider an
example.

74 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
Example 2.5.1 Show that
x4 y3 + x2 y5 + 2xy = c

(2.5.4)

(4x3 y3 + 2xy5 + 2y) dx + (3x4 y2 + 5x2 y4 + 2x) dy = 0.

(2.5.5)

is an implicit solution of

Solution Regarding y as a function of x and differentiating (2.5.4) implicitly with respect to x yields
(4x3 y3 + 2xy5 + 2y) + (3x4 y2 + 5x2 y4 + 2x)

dy
= 0.
dx

Similarly, regarding x as a function of y and differentiating (2.5.4) implicitly with respect to y yields
(4x3 y3 + 2xy5 + 2y)

dx
+ (3x4 y2 + 5x2 y4 + 2x) = 0.
dy

Therefore (2.5.4) is an implicit solution of (2.5.5) in either of its two possible interpretations.
You may think this example is pointless, since concocting a differential equation that has a given
implicit solution isn’t particularly interesting. However, it illustrates the next important theorem, which
we’ll prove by using implicit differentiation, as in Example 2.5.1.
Theorem 2.5.1 If F = F (x, y) has continuous partial derivatives Fx and Fy , then
F (x, y) = c

(c=constant),

(2.5.6)

Fx(x, y) dx + Fy (x, y) dy = 0.

(2.5.7)

is an implicit solution of the differential equation

Proof

Regarding y as a function of x and differentiating (2.5.6) implicitly with respect to x yields
Fx(x, y) + Fy (x, y)

dy
= 0.
dx

On the other hand, regarding x as a function of y and differentiating (2.5.6) implicitly with respect to y
yields
dx
Fx(x, y)
+ Fy (x, y) = 0.
dy
Thus, (2.5.6) is an implicit solution of (2.5.7) in either of its two possible interpretations.
We’ll say that the equation
M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0

(2.5.8)

is exact on an an open rectangle R if there’s a function F = F (x, y) such Fx and Fy are continuous, and
Fx (x, y) = M (x, y) and

Fy (x, y) = N (x, y)

(2.5.9)

for all (x, y) in R. This usage of “exact” is related to its usage in calculus, where the expression
Fx (x, y) dx + Fy (x, y) dy
(obtained by substituting (2.5.9) into the left side of (2.5.8)) is the exact differential of F .
Example 2.5.1 shows that it’s easy to solve (2.5.8) if it’s exact and we know a function F that satisfies
(2.5.9). The important questions are:

Section 2.5 Exact Equations

75

Q UESTION 1. Given an equation (2.5.8), how can we determine whether it’s exact?
Q UESTION 2. If (2.5.8) is exact, how do we find a function F satisfying (2.5.9)?
To discover the answer to Question 1, assume that there’s a function F that satisfies (2.5.9) on some
open rectangle R, and in addition that F has continuous mixed partial derivatives Fxy and Fyx. Then a
theorem from calculus implies that
Fxy = Fyx .
(2.5.10)
If Fx = M and Fy = N , differentiating the first of these equations with respect to y and the second with
respect to x yields
Fxy = My and Fyx = Nx .
(2.5.11)
From (2.5.10) and (2.5.11), we conclude that a necessary condition for exactness is that My = Nx . This
motivates the next theorem, which we state without proof.
Theorem 2.5.2 [The Exactness Condition] Suppose M and N are continuous and have continuous partial derivatives My and Nx on an open rectangle R. Then
M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0
is exact on R if and only if
My (x, y) = Nx (x, y)

(2.5.12)

for all (x, y) in R..
To help you remember the exactness condition, observe that the coefficients of dx and dy are differentiated in (2.5.12) with respect to the “opposite” variables; that is, the coefficient of dx is differentiated
with respect to y, while the coefficient of dy is differentiated with respect to x.
Example 2.5.2 Show that the equation
3x2 y dx + 4x3 dy = 0
is not exact on any open rectangle.
Solution Here
M (x, y) = 3x2 y

and

N (x, y) = 4x3

so
My (x, y) = 3x2

and

Nx (x, y) = 12x2 .

Therefore My = Nx on the line x = 0, but not on any open rectangle, so there’s no function F such that
Fx (x, y) = M (x, y) and Fy (x, y) = N (x, y) for all (x, y) on any open rectangle.
The next example illustrates two possible methods for finding a function F that satisfies the condition
Fx = M and Fy = N if M dx + N dy = 0 is exact.
Example 2.5.3 Solve
(4x3 y3 + 3x2 ) dx + (3x4 y2 + 6y2 ) dy = 0.
Solution (Method 1) Here
M (x, y) = 4x3 y3 + 3x2 ,

N (x, y) = 3x4 y2 + 6y2 ,

(2.5.13)

76 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
and
My (x, y) = Nx (x, y) = 12x3 y2
for all (x, y). Therefore Theorem 2.5.2 implies that there’s a function F such that
Fx(x, y) = M (x, y) = 4x3 y3 + 3x2

(2.5.14)

Fy (x, y) = N (x, y) = 3x4 y2 + 6y2

(2.5.15)

and
for all (x, y). To find F , we integrate (2.5.14) with respect to x to obtain
F (x, y) = x4 y3 + x3 + φ(y),

(2.5.16)

where φ(y) is the “constant” of integration. (Here φ is “constant” in that it’s independent of x, the variable
of integration.) If φ is any differentiable function of y then F satisfies (2.5.14). To determine φ so that F
also satisfies (2.5.15), assume that φ is differentiable and differentiate F with respect to y. This yields
Fy (x, y) = 3x4 y2 + φ0 (y).
Comparing this with (2.5.15) shows that
φ0 (y) = 6y2 .
We integrate this with respect to y and take the constant of integration to be zero because we’re interested
only in finding some F that satisfies (2.5.14) and (2.5.15). This yields
φ(y) = 2y3 .
Substituting this into (2.5.16) yields
F (x, y) = x4 y3 + x3 + 2y3 .

(2.5.17)

Now Theorem 2.5.1 implies that
x4 y3 + x3 + 2y3 = c
is an implicit solution of (2.5.13). Solving this for y yields the explicit solution
y=



c − x3
2 + x4

1/3

.

Solution (Method 2) Instead of first integrating (2.5.14) with respect to x, we could begin by integrating
(2.5.15) with respect to y to obtain
F (x, y) = x4 y3 + 2y3 + ψ(x),

(2.5.18)

where ψ is an arbitrary function of x. To determine ψ, we assume that ψ is differentiable and differentiate
F with respect to x, which yields
Fx(x, y) = 4x3 y3 + ψ0 (x).
Comparing this with (2.5.14) shows that
ψ0 (x) = 3x2 .
Integrating this and again taking the constant of integration to be zero yields
ψ(x) = x3 .

Figure 2.5.1 A direction field and integral curves for (4x3 y3 + 3x2 ) dx + (3x4 y2 + 6y2 ) dy = 0
Substituting this into (2.5.18) yields (2.5.17).
Figure 2.5.1 shows a direction field and some integral curves of (2.5.13),
Here’s a summary of the procedure used in Method 1 of this example. You should summarize procedure
used in Method 2.
Procedure For Solving An Exact Equation
Step 1. Check that the equation
M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0

(2.5.19)

satisfies the exactness condition My = Nx . If not, don’t go further with this procedure.
Step 2. Integrate
∂F (x, y)
= M (x, y)
∂x
with respect to x to obtain
F (x, y) = G(x, y) + φ(y),

(2.5.20)

where G is an antiderivative of M with respect to x, and φ is an unknown function of y.
Step 3. Differentiate (2.5.20) with respect to y to obtain
∂F (x, y)
∂G(x, y)
=
+ φ0 (y).
∂y
∂y
Step 4. Equate the right side of this equation to N and solve for φ0 ; thus,
∂G(x, y)
+ φ0 (y) = N (x, y),
∂y

so

φ0 (y) = N (x, y) −

∂G(x, y)
.
∂y

78 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
Step 5. Integrate φ0 with respect to y, taking the constant of integration to be zero, and substitute the
result in (2.5.20) to obtain F (x, y).
Step 6. Set F (x, y) = c to obtain an implicit solution of (2.5.19). If possible, solve for y explicitly as a
function of x.
It’s a common mistake to omit Step 6. However, it’s important to include this step, since F isn’t itself
a solution of (2.5.19).
Many equations can be conveniently solved by either of the two methods used in Example 2.5.3. However, sometimes the integration required in one approach is more difficult than in the other. In such cases
we choose the approach that requires the easier integration.
Example 2.5.4 Solve the equation
(yexy tan x + exy sec2 x) dx + xexy tan x dy = 0.

(2.5.21)

Solution We leave it to you to check that My = Nx on any open rectangle where tan x and sec x are
defined. Here we must find a function F such that
Fx (x, y) = yexy tan x + exy sec 2 x

(2.5.22)

Fy (x, y) = xexy tan x.

(2.5.23)

and
It’s difficult to integrate (2.5.22) with respect to x, but easy to integrate (2.5.23) with respect to y. This
yields
F (x, y) = exy tan x + ψ(x).
(2.5.24)
Differentiating this with respect to x yields
Fx(x, y) = yexy tan x + exy sec2 x + ψ0 (x).
Comparing this with (2.5.22) shows that ψ0 (x) = 0. Hence, ψ is a constant, which we can take to be zero
in (2.5.24), and
exy tan x = c
is an implicit solution of (2.5.21).
Attempting to apply our procedure to an equation that isn’t exact will lead to failure in Step 4, since
the function
∂G
N−
∂y
won’t be independent of x if My 6= Nx (Exercise 31), and therefore can’t be the derivative of a function
of y alone. Here’s an example that illustrates this.
Example 2.5.5 Verify that the equation
3x2 y2 dx + 6x3 y dy = 0

(2.5.25)

is not exact, and show that the procedure for solving exact equations fails when applied to (2.5.25).

Section 2.5 Exact Equations

79

Solution Here
My (x, y) = 6x2 y

and

Nx (x, y) = 18x2 y,

so (2.5.25) isn’t exact. Nevertheless, let’s try to find a function F such that
Fx (x, y) = 3x2 y2

(2.5.26)

Fy (x, y) = 6x3 y.

(2.5.27)

and
Integrating (2.5.26) with respect to x yields
F (x, y) = x3 y2 + φ(y),
and differentiating this with respect to y yields
Fy (x, y) = 2x3 y + φ0 (y).
For this equation to be consistent with (2.5.27),
6x3 y = 2x3 y + φ0 (y),
or
φ0 (y) = 4x3 y.
This is a contradiction, since φ0 must be independent of x. Therefore the procedure fails.

2.6 INTEGRATING FACTORS
In Section 2.5 we saw that if M , N , My and Nx are continuous and My = Nx on an open rectangle R
then
M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0
(2.6.1)
is exact on R. Sometimes an equation that isn’t exact can be made exact by multiplying it by an appropriate function. For example,
(3x + 2y2 ) dx + 2xy dy = 0
(2.6.2)
is not exact, since My (x, y) = 4y 6= Nx (x, y) = 2y in (2.6.2). However, multiplying (2.6.2) by x yields
(3x2 + 2xy2 ) dx + 2x2 y dy = 0,

(2.6.3)

which is exact, since My (x, y) = Nx (x, y) = 4xy in (2.6.3). Solving (2.6.3) by the procedure given in
Section 2.5 yields the implicit solution
x3 + x2 y2 = c.
A function µ = µ(x, y) is an integrating factor for (2.6.1) if
µ(x, y)M (x, y) dx + µ(x, y)N (x, y) dy = 0

(2.6.4)

is exact. If we know an integrating factor µ for (2.6.1), we can solve the exact equation (2.6.4) by the
method of Section 2.5. It would be nice if we could say that (2.6.1) and (2.6.4) always have the same
solutions, but this isn’t so. For example, a solution y = y(x) of (2.6.4) such that µ(x, y(x)) = 0 on
some interval a < x < b could fail to be a solution of (2.6.1) (Exercise 1), while (2.6.1) may have a
solution y = y(x) such that µ(x, y(x)) isn’t even defined (Exercise 2). Similar comments apply if y is
the independent variable and x is the dependent variable in (2.6.1) and (2.6.4). However, if µ(x, y) is
defined and nonzero for all (x, y), (2.6.1) and (2.6.4) are equivalent; that is, they have the same solutions.
Finding Integrating Factors
By applying Theorem 2.5.2 (with M and N replaced by µM and µN ), we see that (2.6.4) is exact on an
open rectangle R if µM , µN , (µM )y , and (µN )x are continuous and
∂
∂
(µM ) =
(µN )
∂y
∂x

or, equivalently,

µy M + µMy = µx N + µNx

on R. It’s better to rewrite the last equation as
µ(My − Nx ) = µx N − µy M,

(2.6.5)

which reduces to the known result for exact equations; that is, if My = Nx then (2.6.5) holds with µ = 1,
so (2.6.1) is exact.
You may think (2.6.5) is of little value, since it involves partial derivatives of the unknown integrating
factor µ, and we haven’t studied methods for solving such equations. However, we’ll now show that
(2.6.5) is useful if we restrict our search to integrating factors that are products of a function of x and a

84 Chapter 2 Integrating Factors
function of y; that is, µ(x, y) = P (x)Q(y). We’re not saying that every equation M dx + N dy = 0
has an integrating factor of this form; rather, we’re saying that some equations have such integrating
factors.We’llnow develop a way to determine whether a given equation has such an integrating factor,
and a method for finding the integrating factor in this case.
If µ(x, y) = P (x)Q(y), then µx(x, y) = P 0 (x)Q(y) and µy (x, y) = P (x)Q0 (y), so (2.6.5) becomes
P (x)Q(y)(My − Nx ) = P 0 (x)Q(y)N − P (x)Q0 (y)M,

(2.6.6)

or, after dividing through by P (x)Q(y),
My − Nx =
Now let
p(x) =

P 0 (x)

P (x)

and

q(y) =

(2.6.7)

Q0 (y)
,
Q(y)

so (2.6.7) becomes
My − Nx = p(x)N − q(y)M.

(2.6.8)

We obtained (2.6.8) by assuming that M dx+N dy = 0 has an integrating factor µ(x, y) = P (x)Q(y).
However, we can now view (2.6.7) differently: If there are functions p = p(x) and q = q(y) that satisfy
(2.6.8) and we define
R
R
P (x) = ±e p(x) dx and Q(y) = ±e q(y) dy ,
(2.6.9)

then reversing the steps that led from (2.6.6) to (2.6.8) shows that µ(x, y) = P (x)Q(y) is an integrating
factor for M dx + N dy = 0. In using this result, we take the constants of integration in (2.6.9) to be zero
and choose the signs conveniently so the integrating factor has the simplest form.
There’s no simple general method for ascertaining whether functions p = p(x) and q = q(y) satisfying
(2.6.8) exist. However, the next theorem gives simple sufficient conditions for the given equation to have
an integrating factor that depends on only one of the independent variables x and y, and for finding an
integrating factor in this case.
Theorem 2.6.1 Let M, N, My , and Nx be continuous on an open rectangle R. Then:
(a) If (My − Nx )/N is independent of y on R and we define
p(x) =

Section 2.6 Exact Equations

85

Proof (a) If (My − Nx )/N is independent of y, then (2.6.8) holds with p = (My − Nx )/N and q ≡ 0.
Therefore
R
R
P (x) = ±e p(x) dx and Q(y) = ±e q(y) dy = ±e0 = ±1,

so (2.6.10) is an integrating factor for (2.6.11) on R.
(b) If (Nx − My )/M is independent of x then eqrefeq:2.6.8 holds with p ≡ 0 and q = (Nx − My )/M ,
and a similar argument shows that (2.6.12) is an integrating factor for (2.6.11) on R.
The next two examples show how to apply Theorem 2.6.1.
Example 2.6.1 Find an integrating factor for the equation
(2xy3 − 2x3 y3 − 4xy2 + 2x) dx + (3x2 y2 + 4y) dy = 0

(2.6.13)

and solve the equation.
Solution In (2.6.13)
M = 2xy3 − 2x3 y3 − 4xy2 + 2x, N = 3x2 y2 + 4y,
and
My − Nx = (6xy2 − 6x3 y2 − 8xy) − 6xy2 = −6x3 y2 − 8xy,

so (2.6.13) isn’t exact. However,

My − Nx
6x3 y2 + 8xy

N
3x y + 4y
is independent of y, so Theorem 2.6.1(a) applies with p(x) = −2x. Since

e−x (2xy3 − 2x3 y3 − 4xy2 + 2x) dx + e−x (3x2 y2 + 4y) dy = 0.

(2.6.14)

To solve this equation, we must find a function F such that
2

Fx (x, y) = e−x (2xy3 − 2x3 y3 − 4xy2 + 2x)
and

2

Fy (x, y) = e−x (3x2 y2 + 4y).

(2.6.15)
(2.6.16)

Integrating (2.6.16) with respect to y yields
2

F (x, y) = e−x (x2 y3 + 2y2 ) + ψ(x).

(2.6.17)

Differentiating this with respect to x yields
2

Fx(x, y) = e−x (2xy3 − 2x3 y3 − 4xy2 ) + ψ0 (x).
2

2

Comparing this with (2.6.15) shows that ψ0 (x) = 2xe−x ; therefore, we can let ψ(x) = −e−x in
(2.6.17) and conclude that

µ(y) = ey is an integrating factor. Multiplying (2.6.18) by µ yields the exact equation
2xy3 ey dx + (3x2 y2 + x2 y3 + 1)ey dy = 0.

(2.6.19)

To solve this equation, we must find a function F such that
Fx(x, y) = 2xy3 ey

(2.6.20)

Fy (x, y) = (3x2 y2 + x2 y3 + 1)ey .

(2.6.21)

and
Integrating (2.6.20) with respect to x yields
F (x, y) = x2 y3 ey + φ(y).

(2.6.22)

Differentiating this with respect to y yields
Fy = (3x2 y2 + x2 y3 )ey + φ0 (y),
and comparing this with (2.6.21) shows that φ0 (y) = ey . Therefore we set φ(y) = ey in (2.6.22) and
conclude that
(x2 y3 + 1)ey = c
is an implicit solution of (2.6.19). It is also an implicit solution of (2.6.18). Figure 2.6.2 shows a direction

Theorem 2.6.1 does not apply in the next example, but the more general argument that led to Theorem 2.6.1 provides an integrating factor.

88 Chapter 2 Integrating Factors
Example 2.6.3 Find an integrating factor for
(3xy + 6y2 ) dx + (2x2 + 9xy) dy = 0

(2.6.23)

and solve the equation.
Solution In (2.6.23)
M = 3xy + 6y2 , N = 2x2 + 9xy,
and
My − Nx = (3x + 12y) − (4x + 9y) = −x + 3y.
Therefore

My − Nx

=
M

Nx − My

N
2x + 9xy

and

so Theorem 2.6.1 does not apply. Following the more general argument that led to Theorem 2.6.1, we
look for functions p = p(x) and q = q(y) such that
My − Nx = p(x)N − q(y)M ;
that is,
−x + 3y = p(x)(2x2 + 9xy) − q(y)(3xy + 6y2 ).
Since the left side contains only first degree terms in x and y, we rewrite this equation as
xp(x)(2x + 9y) − yq(y)(3x + 6y) = −x + 3y.
This will be an identity if
xp(x) = A

and yq(y) = B,

(2.6.24)

where A and B are constants such that
−x + 3y = A(2x + 9y) − B(3x + 6y),
or, equivalently,
−x + 3y = (2A − 3B)x + (9A − 6B)y.
Equating the coefficients of x and y on both sides shows that the last equation holds for all (x, y) if
2A − 3B

which has the solution A = 1, B = 1. Therefore (2.6.24) implies that

(3x2 y2 + 6xy3 ) dx + (2x3 y + 9x2 y2 ) dy = 0.

(2.6.25)

This is also an implicit solution of (2.6.23). Since x ≡ 0 and y ≡ 0 satisfy (2.6.25), you should check to
see that x ≡ 0 and y ≡ 0 are also solutions of (2.6.23). (Why is it necesary to check this?)

96 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods
3.1 EULER’S METHOD
If an initial value problem
y0 = f(x, y),

y(x0 ) = y0

(3.1.1)

can’t be solved analytically, it’s necessary to resort to numerical methods to obtain useful approximations
to a solution of (3.1.1). We’ll consider such methods in this chapter.
We’re interested in computing approximate values of the solution of (3.1.1) at equally spaced points
x0 , x1 , . . . , xn = b in an interval [x0 , b]. Thus,
xi = x0 + ih,

i = 0, 1, . . . , n,

where

b − x0
.
n
We’ll denote the approximate values of the solution at these points by y0 , y1 , . . . , yn ; thus, yi is an
approximation to y(xi ). We’ll call
ei = y(xi ) − yi
h=

the error at the ith step. Because of the initial condition y(x0 ) = y0 , we’ll always have e0 = 0. However,
in general ei 6= 0 if i > 0.
We encounter two sources of error in applying a numerical method to solve an initial value problem:
• The formulas defining the method are based on some sort of approximation. Errors due to the
inaccuracy of the approximation are called truncation errors.
• Computers do arithmetic with a fixed number of digits, and therefore make errors in evaluating
the formulas defining the numerical methods. Errors due to the computer’s inability to do exact
arithmetic are called roundoff errors.
Since a careful analysis of roundoff error is beyond the scope of this book, we’ll consider only truncation errors.
Euler’s Method
The simplest numerical method for solving (3.1.1) is Euler’s method. This method is so crude that it is
seldom used in practice; however, its simplicity makes it useful for illustrative purposes.
Euler’s method is based on the assumption that the tangent line to the integral curve of (3.1.1) at
(xi , y(xi )) approximates the integral curve over the interval [xi , xi+1 ]. Since the slope of the integral
curve of (3.1.1) at (xi , y(xi )) is y0 (xi ) = f(xi , y(xi )), the equation of the tangent line to the integral
curve at (xi , y(xi )) is
y = y(xi ) + f(xi , y(xi ))(x − xi ).
(3.1.2)
Setting x = xi+1 = xi + h in (3.1.2) yields
yi+1 = y(xi ) + hf(xi , y(xi ))

(3.1.3)

as an approximation to y(xi+1 ). Since y(x0 ) = y0 is known, we can use (3.1.3) with i = 0 to compute
y1 = y0 + hf(x0 , y0 ).
However, setting i = 1 in (3.1.3) yields
y2 = y(x1 ) + hf(x1 , y(x1 )),

Section 3.1 Euler’s Method

97

which isn’t useful, since we don’t know y(x1 ). Therefore we replace y(x1 ) by its approximate value y1
and redefine
y2 = y1 + hf(x1 , y1 ).
Having computed y2 , we can compute
y3 = y2 + hf(x2 , y2 ).
In general, Euler’s method starts with the known value y(x0 ) = y0 and computes y1 , y2 , . . . , yn successively by with the formula
yi+1 = yi + hf(xi , yi ),

0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

(3.1.4)

The next example illustrates the computational procedure indicated in Euler’s method.
Example 3.1.1 Use Euler’s method with h = 0.1 to find approximate values for the solution of the initial
value problem
y0 + 2y = x3 e−2x , y(0) = 1
(3.1.5)
at x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.
Solution We rewrite (3.1.5) as
y0 = −2y + x3 e−2x ,

y(0) = 1,

which is of the form (3.1.1), with
f(x, y) = −2y + x3 e−2x, x0 = 0, and y0 = 1.
Euler’s method yields


.640081873 + (.1) −2(.640081873) + (.2)3 e−.4 = .512601754.

We’ve written the details of these computations to ensure that you understand the procedure. However,
in the rest of the examples as well as the exercises in this chapter, we’ll assume that you can use a
programmable calculator or a computer to carry out the necessary computations.
Examples Illustrating The Error in Euler’s Method
Example 3.1.2 Use Euler’s method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to find approximate values of the solution of the initial value problem
y0 + 2y = x3 e−2x ,

the estimates of the solution obtained for x = 0.05, 0.15, . . . , since there’s nothing to compare them with
in the column corresponding to h = 0.1. Similarly, the approximate values in the column corresponding
to h = 0.025 are actually the results of 40 steps with Euler’s method.

You can see from Table 3.1.1 that decreasing the step size improves the accuracy of Euler’s method.
For example,

 .0293 with h = 0.1,
.0144 with h = 0.05,
yexact (1) − yapprox (1) ≈

.0071 with h = 0.025.

Based on this scanty evidence, you might guess that the error in approximating the exact solution at a fixed
value of x by Euler’s method is roughly halved when the step size is halved. You can find more evidence
to support this conjecture by examining Table 3.1.2, which lists the approximate values of yexact − yapprox at
x = 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.0.

except in this case we can’t solve (3.1.7) exactly. The results in the “Exact” column were obtained by
using a more accurate numerical method known as the Runge-Kutta method with a small step size. They
are exact to eight decimal places.
Since we think it’s important in evaluating the accuracy of the numerical methods that we’ll be studying
in this chapter, we often include a column listing values of the exact solution of the initial value problem,
even if the directions in the example or exercise don’t specifically call for it. If quotation marks are
included in the heading, the values were obtained by applying the Runge-Kutta method in a way that’s
explained in Section 3.3. If quotation marks are not included, the values were obtained from a known
formula for the solution. In either case, the values are exact to eight places to the right of the decimal
point.

Truncation Error in Euler’s Method
Consistent with the results indicated in Tables 3.1.1–3.1.4, we’ll now show that under reasonable assumptions on f there’s a constant K such that the error in approximating the solution of the initial value
problem
y0 = f(x, y), y(x0 ) = y0 ,
at a given point b > x0 by Euler’s method with step size h = (b − x0 )/n satisfies the inequality
|y(b) − yn | ≤ Kh,

100 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods
where K is a constant independent of n.
There are two sources of error (not counting roundoff) in Euler’s method:
1. The error committed in approximating the integral curve by the tangent line (3.1.2) over the interval
[xi , xi+1 ].
2. The error committed in replacing y(xi ) by yi in (3.1.2) and using (3.1.4) rather than (3.1.2) to
compute yi+1 .
Euler’s method assumes that yi+1 defined in (3.1.2) is an approximation to y(xi+1 ). We call the error
in this approximation the local truncation error at the ith step, and denote it by Ti ; thus,
Ti = y(xi+1 ) − y(xi ) − hf(xi , y(xi )).

(3.1.8)

We’ll now use Taylor’s theorem to estimate Ti , assuming for simplicity that f, fx , and fy are continuous
and bounded for all (x, y). Then y00 exists and is bounded on [x0 , b]. To see this, we differentiate
y0 (x) = f(x, y(x))
to obtain
y00 (x) =
=

fx (x, y(x)) + fy (x, y(x))y0 (x)
fx (x, y(x)) + fy (x, y(x))f(x, y(x)).

Since we assumed that f, fx and fy are bounded, there’s a constant M such that
|fx (x, y(x)) + fy (x, y(x))f(x, y(x))| ≤ M,

x0 < x < b,

which implies that
|y00 (x)| ≤ M,

x0 < x < b.

(3.1.9)

Since xi+1 = xi + h, Taylor’s theorem implies that
y(xi+1 ) = y(xi ) + hy0 (xi ) +

h2 00
y (x̃i ),
2

where x̃i is some number between xi and xi+1 . Since y0 (xi ) = f(xi , y(xi )) this can be written as
y(xi+1 ) = y(xi ) + hf(xi , y(xi )) +

h2 00
y (x̃i ),
2

y(xi+1 ) − y(xi ) − hf(xi , y(xi )) =

h2 00
y (x̃i ).
2

or, equivalently,

Comparing this with (3.1.8) shows that
Ti =

h2 00
y (x̃i ).
2

Recalling (3.1.9), we can establish the bound
|Ti | ≤

M h2
,
2

1 ≤ i ≤ n.

(3.1.10)

Although it may be difficult to determine the constant M , what is important is that there’s an M such that
(3.1.10) holds. We say that the local truncation error of Euler’s method is of order h2 , which we write as
O(h2 ).

Section 3.1 Euler’s Method

101

Note that the magnitude of the local truncation error in Euler’s method is determined by the second
derivative y00 of the solution of the initial value problem. Therefore the local truncation error will be
larger where |y00 | is large, or smaller where |y00 | is small.
Since the local truncation error for Euler’s method is O(h2 ), it’s reasonable to expect that halving h
reduces the local truncation error by a factor of 4. This is true, but halving the step size also requires twice
as many steps to approximate the solution at a given point. To analyze the overall effect of truncation
error in Euler’s method, it’s useful to derive an equation relating the errors
ei+1 = y(xi+1 ) − yi+1

and

ei = y(xi ) − yi .

To this end, recall that
y(xi+1 ) = y(xi ) + hf(xi , y(xi )) + Ti

(3.1.11)

yi+1 = yi + hf(xi , yi ).

(3.1.12)

and
Subtracting (3.1.12) from (3.1.11) yields
ei+1 = ei + h [f(xi , y(xi )) − f(xi , yi )] + Ti .

(3.1.13)

The last term on the right is the local truncation error at the ith step. The other terms reflect the way errors
made at previous steps affect ei+1 . Since |Ti | ≤ M h2 /2, we see from (3.1.13) that
|ei+1 | ≤ |ei | + h|f(xi , y(xi )) − f(xi , yi )| +

M h2
.
2

(3.1.14)

Since we assumed that fy is continuous and bounded, the mean value theorem implies that
f(xi , y(xi )) − f(xi , yi ) = fy (xi , yi∗ )(y(xi ) − yi ) = fy (xi , yi∗ )ei ,
where yi∗ is between yi and y(xi ). Therefore
|f(xi , y(xi )) − f(xi , yi )| ≤ R|ei |
for some constant R. From this and (3.1.14),
|ei+1 | ≤ (1 + Rh)|ei | +

Semilinear Equations and Variation of Parameters
An equation that can be written in the form
y0 + p(x)y = h(x, y)

(3.1.19)

with p 6≡ 0 is said to be semilinear. (Of course, (3.1.19) is linear if h is independent of y.) One way to
apply Euler’s method to an initial value problem
y0 + p(x)y = h(x, y),

y(x0 ) = y0

(3.1.20)

for (3.1.19) is to think of it as
y0 = f(x, y),

y(x0 ) = y0 ,

where
f(x, y) = −p(x)y + h(x, y).
However, we can also start by applying variation of parameters to (3.1.20), as in Sections 2.1 and 2.4;
thus, we write the solution of (3.1.20) as y = uy1 , where y1 is a nontrivial solution of the complementary
equation y0 + p(x)y = 0. Then y = uy1 is a solution of (3.1.20) if and only if u is a solution of the initial
value problem
u0 = h(x, uy1 (x))/y1 (x), u(x0 ) = y(x0 )/y1 (x0 ).
(3.1.21)
We can apply Euler’s method to obtain approximate values u0 , u1 , . . . , un of this initial value problem,
and then take
yi = ui y1 (xi )
as approximate values of the solution of (3.1.20). We’ll call this procedure the Euler semilinear method.
The next two examples show that the Euler and Euler semilinear methods may yield drastically different
results.

the large differences between the estimates obtained for the three values of h, it would be clear that these
results are useless even if the “exact” values were not included in the table.

It’s easy to see why Euler’s method yields such poor results. Recall that the constant M in (3.1.10) –
which plays an important role in determining the local truncation error in Euler’s method – must be an
upper bound for the values of the second derivative y00 of the solution of the initial value problem (3.1.22)
on (0, 2). The problem is that y00 assumes very large values on this interval. To see this, we differentiate
(3.1.24) to obtain
y00 (x) = 2y(x) + 2xy0 (x) = 2y(x) + 2x(1 + 2xy(x)) = 2(1 + 2x2 )y(x) + 2x,
2

where the second equality follows again from (3.1.24). Since (3.1.23) implies that y(x) > 3ex if x > 0,
2

y00 (x) > 6(1 + 2x2 )ex + 2x,

x > 0.

For example, letting x = 2 shows that y00 (2) > 2952.
2

S OLUTION (b) Since y1 = ex is a solution of the complementary equation y0 − 2xy = 0, we can apply
the Euler semilinear method to (3.1.22), with
y = uex

2

and

2

u0 = e−x ,

u(0) = 3.

The results listed in Table 3.1.6 are clearly better than those obtained by Euler’s method.

We can’t give a general procedure for determining in advance whether Euler’s method or the semilinear
Euler method will produce better results for a given semilinear initial value problem (3.1.19). As a rule of
thumb, the Euler semilinear method will yield better results than Euler’s method if |u00 | is small on [x0, b],
while Euler’s method yields better results if |u00 | is large on [x0 , b]. In many cases the results obtained by
the two methods don’t differ appreciably. However, we propose the an intuitive way to decide which is
the better method: Try both methods with multiple step sizes, as we did in Example 3.1.4, and accept the
results obtained by the method for which the approximations change less as the step size decreases.
Example 3.1.5 Applying Euler’s method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to the initial
value problem
x
y0 − 2y =
, y(1) = 7
(3.1.25)
1 + y2
on [1, 2] yields the results in Table 3.1.7. Applying the Euler semilinear method with
y = ue2x

and

u0 =

xe−2x
,
1 + u2 e4x

u(1) = 7e−2

yields the results in Table 3.1.8. Since the latter are clearly less dependent on step size than the former,
we conclude that the Euler semilinear method is better than Euler’s method for (3.1.25). This conclusion
is supported by comparing the approximate results obtained by the two methods with the “exact” values
of the solution.

Example 3.1.6 Applying Euler’s method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to the initial
value problem
y0 + 3x2 y = 1 + y2 , y(2) = 2

u0 = ex (1 + u2 e−2x ),

yields the results in Table 3.1.10. Noting the close agreement among the three columns of Table 3.1.9
(at least for larger values of x) and the lack of any such agreement among the columns of Table 3.1.10,
we conclude that Euler’s method is better than the Euler semilinear method for (3.1.26). Comparing the
results with the exact values supports this conclusion.

In the next two sections we’ll study other numerical methods for solving initial value problems, called
the improved Euler method, the midpoint method, Heun’s method and the Runge-Kutta method. If the
initial value problem is semilinear as in (3.1.19), we also have the option of using variation of parameters
and then applying the given numerical method to the initial value problem (3.1.21) for u. By analogy
with the terminology used here, we’ll call the resulting procedure the improved Euler semilinear method,
the midpoint semilinear method, Heun’s semilinear method or the Runge-Kutta semilinear method, as the
case may be.

3.1 Exercises
You may want to save the results of these exercises, sincewe’ll revisit in the next two sections. In Exercises 1–5 use Euler’s method to find approximate values of the solution of the given initial value problem
at the points xi = x0 + ih, where x0 is the point wher the initial condition is imposed and i = 1, 2, 3.
The purpose of these exercises is to familiarize you with the computational procedure of Euler’s method.

N UMERICAL Q UADRATURE . The fundamental theorem of calculus says that if f is continuous
on a closed interval [a, b] then it has an antiderivative F such that F 0 (x) = f(x) on [a, b] and

f(x) dx = F (b) − F (a).

This solves the problem of evaluating a definite integral if the integrand f has an antiderivative that
can be found and evaluated easily. However, if f doesn’t have this property, (A) doesn’t provide

3.2 THE IMPROVED EULER METHOD AND RELATED METHODS
In Section 3.1 we saw that the global truncation error of Euler’s method is O(h), which would seem to
imply that we can achieve arbitrarily accurate results with Euler’s method by simply choosing the step size
sufficiently small. However, this isn’t a good idea, for two reasons. First, after a certain point decreasing
the step size will increase roundoff errors to the point where the accuracy will deteriorate rather than
improve. The second and more important reason is that in most applications of numerical methods to an
initial value problem
y0 = f(x, y), y(x0 ) = y0 ,
(3.2.1)
the expensive part of the computation is the evaluation of f. Therefore we want methods that give good
results for a given number of such evaluations. This is what motivates us to look for numerical methods
better than Euler’s.
To clarify this point, suppose we want to approximate the value of e by applying Euler’s method to the
initial value problem
y0 = y, y(0) = 1, (with solution y = ex )
on [0, 1], with h = 1/12, 1/24, and 1/48, respectively. Since each step in Euler’s method requires
one evaluation of f, the number of evaluations of f in each of these attempts is n = 12, 24, and 48,
respectively. In each case we accept yn as an approximation to e. The second column of Table 3.2.1
shows the results. The first column of the table indicates the number of evaluations of f required to
obtain the approximation, and the last column contains the value of e rounded to ten significant figures.
In this section we’ll study the improved Euler method, which requires two evaluations of f at each
step. We’ve used this method with h = 1/6, 1/12, and 1/24. The required number of evaluations of f

110 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods
were 12, 24, and 48, as in the three applications of Euler’s method; however, you can see from the third
column of Table 3.2.1 that the approximation to e obtained by the improved Euler method with only 12
evaluations of f is better than the approximation obtained by Euler’s method with 48 evaluations.
In Section 3.1 we’ll study the Runge-Kutta method, which requires four evaluations of f at each step.
We’ve used this method with h = 1/3, 1/6, and 1/12. The required number of evaluations of f were
again 12, 24, and 48, as in the three applications of Euler’s method and the improved Euler method;
however, you can see from the fourth column of Table 3.2.1 that the approximation to e obtained by
the Runge-Kutta method with only 12 evaluations of f is better than the approximation obtained by the
improved Euler method with 48 evaluations.

The Improved Euler Method
The improved Euler method for solving the initial value problem (3.2.1) is based on approximating the
integral curve of (3.2.1) at (xi , y(xi )) by the line through (xi , y(xi )) with slope
mi =

f(xi , y(xi )) + f(xi+1 , y(xi+1 ))
;
2

that is, mi is the average of the slopes of the tangents to the integral curve at the endpoints of [xi , xi+1 ].
The equation of the approximating line is therefore
y = y(xi ) +

f(xi , y(xi )) + f(xi+1 , y(xi+1 ))
(x − xi ).
2

(3.2.2)

Setting x = xi+1 = xi + h in (3.2.2) yields
yi+1 = y(xi ) +

h
(f(xi , y(xi )) + f(xi+1 , y(xi+1 )))
2

(3.2.3)

as an approximation to y(xi+1 ). As in our derivation of Euler’s method, we replace y(xi ) (unknown if
i > 0) by its approximate value yi ; then (3.2.3) becomes
yi+1 = yi +

h
(f(xi , yi ) + f(xi+1 , y(xi+1 )) .
2

However, this still won’t work, because we don’t know y(xi+1 ), which appears on the right. We overcome
this by replacing y(xi+1 ) by yi + hf(xi , yi ), the value that the Euler method would assign to yi+1 .
Thus, the improved Euler method starts with the known value y(x0 ) = y0 and computes y1 , y2 , . . . , yn
successively with the formula
yi+1 = yi +

h
(f(xi , yi ) + f(xi+1 , yi + hf(xi , yi ))) .
2

The computation indicated here can be conveniently organized as follows: given yi , compute
k1i
k2i

=

yi+1

=

f(xi , yi ),
f (xi + h, yi + hk1i ) ,

yi + (k1i + k2i ).

(3.2.4)

Section 3.2 The Improved Euler Method and Related Methods

111

The improved Euler method requires two evaluations of f(x, y) per step, while Euler’s method requires
only one. However, we’ll see at the end of this section that if f satisfies appropriate assumptions, the local
truncation error with the improved Euler method is O(h3 ), rather than O(h2 ) as with Euler’s method.
Therefore the global truncation error with the improved Euler method is O(h2 ); however, we won’t prove
this.
We note that the magnitude of the local truncation error in the improved Euler method and other
methods discussed in this section is determined by the third derivative y000 of the solution of the initial
value problem. Therefore the local truncation error will be larger where |y000 | is large, or smaller where
|y000 | is small.
The next example, which deals with the initial value problem considered in Example 3.1.1, illustrates
the computational procedure indicated in the improved Euler method.
Example 3.2.1 Use the improved Euler method with h = 0.1 to find approximate values of the solution
of the initial value problem
y0 + 2y = x3 e−2x , y(0) = 1
(3.2.5)
at x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.
Solution As in Example 3.1.1, we rewrite (3.2.5) as
y0 = −2y + x3 e−2x ,

y(0) = 1,

which is of the form (3.2.1), with
f(x, y) = −2y + x3 e−2x , x0 = 0, and y0 = 1.

= .820040937 + (.05)(−1.639263142 − 1.306866684) = .672734445,
= f(x2 , y2 ) = f(.2, .672734445) = −2(.672734445) + (.2)3 e−.4 = −1.340106330,
= f(x3 , y2 + hk12 ) = f(.3, .672734445 + .1(−1.340106330)),

2
= .672734445 + (.05)(−1.340106330 − 1.062629710) = .552597643.

114 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods
A Family of Methods with O(h3 ) Local Truncation Error
We’ll now derive a class of methods with O(h3 ) local truncation error for solving (3.2.1). For simplicity,
we assume that f, fx , fy , fxx , fyy , and fxy are continuous and bounded for all (x, y). This implies that
if y is the solution of (3.2.1 then y00 and y000 are bounded (Exercise 31).
We begin by approximating the integral curve of (3.2.1) at (xi , y(xi )) by the line through (xi , y(xi ))
with slope
mi = σy0 (xi ) + ρy0 (xi + θh),
where σ, ρ, and θ are constants that we’ll soon specify; however, we insist at the outset that 0 < θ ≤ 1,
so that
xi < xi + θh ≤ xi+1 .
The equation of the approximating line is
y

=
=

y(xi ) + mi (x − xi )
y(xi ) + [σy0 (xi ) + ρy0 (xi + θh)] (x − xi ).

(3.2.7)

Setting x = xi+1 = xi + h in (3.2.7) yields
ŷi+1 = y(xi ) + h [σy0 (xi ) + ρy0 (xi + θh)]
as an approximation to y(xi+1 ).
To determine σ, ρ, and θ so that the error
Ei

=
=

y(xi+1 ) − ŷi+1
y(xi+1 ) − y(xi ) − h [σy0 (xi ) + ρy0 (xi + θh)]

(3.2.8)

in this approximation is O(h3 ), we begin by recalling from Taylor’s theorem that
y(xi+1 ) = y(xi ) + hy0 (xi ) +

h2 00
h3
y (xi ) + y000 (x̂i ),

6

where x̂i is in (xi , xi+1 ). Since y000 is bounded this implies that
y(xi+1 ) − y(xi ) − hy0 (xi ) −

h2 00
y (xi ) = O(h3 ).
2

Comparing this with (3.2.8) shows that Ei = O(h3 ) if
σy0 (xi ) + ρy0 (xi + θh) = y0 (xi ) +

h 00
y (xi ) + O(h2 ).

(3.2.9)

However, applying Taylor’s theorem to y0 shows that
y0 (xi + θh) = y0 (xi ) + θhy00 (xi ) +

(θh)2 000
y (xi ),
2

where xi is in (xi , xi + θh). Since y000 is bounded, this implies that
y0 (xi + θh) = y0 (xi ) + θhy00 (xi ) + O(h2 ).
Substituting this into (3.2.9) and noting that the sum of two O(h2 ) terms is again O(h2 ) shows that
Ei = O(h3 ) if
h
(σ + ρ)y0 (xi ) + ρθhy00 (xi ) = y0 (xi ) + y00 (xi ),

(3.2.10)

Since y0 = f(x, y), we can now conclude from (3.2.8) that
y(xi+1 ) = y(xi ) + h [σf(xi , yi ) + ρf(xi + θh, y(xi + θh))] + O(h3 )

(3.2.11)

if σ, ρ, and θ satisfy (3.2.10). However, this formula would not be useful even if we knew y(xi ) exactly
(as we would for i = 0), since we still wouldn’t know y(xi + θh) exactly. To overcome this difficulty, we
again use Taylor’s theorem to write
y(xi + θh) = y(xi ) + θhy0 (xi ) +

h2 00
y (x̃i ),
2

where x̃i is in (xi , xi + θh). Since y0 (xi ) = f(xi , y(xi )) and y00 is bounded, this implies that
|y(xi + θh) − y(xi ) − θhf(xi , y(xi ))| ≤ Kh2

(3.2.12)

for some constant K. Since fy is bounded, the mean value theorem implies that
|f(xi + θh, u) − f(xi + θh, v)| ≤ M |u − v|
for some constant M . Letting
u = y(xi + θh)

and

v = y(xi ) + θhf(xi , y(xi ))

and recalling (3.2.12) shows that
f(xi + θh, y(xi + θh)) = f(xi + θh, y(xi ) + θhf(xi , y(xi ))) + O(h2 ).
Substituting this into (3.2.11) yields
y(xi+1 ) =

y(xi ) + h [σf(xi , y(xi ))+
ρf(xi + θh, y(xi ) + θhf(xi , y(xi )))] + O(h3 ).

This implies that the formula
yi+1 = yi + h [σf(xi , yi ) + ρf(xi + θh, yi + θhf(xi , yi ))]
has O(h3 ) local truncation error if σ, ρ, and θ satisfy (3.2.10). Substituting σ = 1 − ρ and θ = 1/2ρ here
yields

3.3 THE RUNGE-KUTTA METHOD
In general, if k is any positive integer and f satisfies appropriate assumptions, there are numerical methods
with local truncation error O(hk+1 ) for solving an initial value problem
y0 = f(x, y),

y(x0 ) = y0 .

(3.3.1)
k+1

Moreover, it can be shown that a method with local truncation error O(h ) has global truncation error
O(hk ). In Sections 3.1 and 3.2 we studied numerical methods where k = 1 and k = 2. We’ll skip
methods for which k = 3 and proceed to the Runge-Kutta method, the most widely used method, for
which k = 4. The magnitude of the local truncation error is determined by the fifth derivative y(5) of
the solution of the initial value problem. Therefore the local truncation error will be larger where |y(5) |
is large, or smaller where |y(5) | is small. The Runge-Kutta method computes approximate values y1 , y2 ,
. . . , yn of the solution of (3.3.1) at x0 , x0 + h, . . . , x0 + nh as follows: Given yi , compute

The Case Where x0 Isn’t The Left Endpoint
So far in this chapter we’ve considered numerical methods for solving an initial value problem
y0 = f(x, y),

y(x0 ) = y0

(3.3.3)

on an interval [x0, b], for which x0 is the left endpoint. We haven’t discussed numerical methods for
solving (3.3.3) on an interval [a, x0], for which x0 is the right endpoint. To be specific, how can we
obtain approximate values y−1 , y−2 , . . . , y−n of the solution of (3.3.3) at x0 − h, . . . , x0 − nh, where
h = (x0 − a)/n? Here’s the answer to this question:
Consider the initial value problem
z 0 = −f(−x, z),

z(−x0 ) = y0 ,

(3.3.4)

on the interval [−x0 , −a], for which −x0 is the left endpoint. Use a numerical method to obtain approximate values z1 , z2 , . . . , zn of the solution of (3.3.4) at −x0 + h, −x0 + 2h, . . . , −x0 + nh = −a. Then

Section 3.3 The Runge-Kutta Method

123

y−1 = z1 , y−2 = z2 , . . . , y−n = zn are approximate values of the solution of (3.3.3) at x0 − h, x0 − 2h,
. . . , x0 − nh = a.
The justification for this answer is sketched in Exercise 23. Note how easy it is to make the change the
given problem (3.3.3) to the modified problem (3.3.4): first replace f by −f and then replace x, x0 , and
y by −x, −x0 , and z, respectively.
Example 3.3.5 Use the Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.1 to find approximate values of the
solution of
(y − 1)2 y0 = 2x + 3, y(1) = 4
(3.3.5)
at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.
Solution We first rewrite (3.3.5) in the form (3.3.3) as
y0 =

2x + 3
,
(y − 1)2

y(1) = 4.

(3.3.6)

Since the initial condition y(1) = 4 is imposed at the right endpoint of the interval [0, 1], we apply the
Runge-Kutta method to the initial value problem
z0 =

2x − 3
,
(z − 1)2

z(−1) = 4

(3.3.7)

on the interval [−1, 0]. (You should verify that (3.3.7) is related to (3.3.6) as (3.3.4) is related to (3.3.3).)
Table 3.3.5 shows the results. Reversing the order of the rows in Table 3.3.5 and changing the signs of
the values of x yields the first two columns of Table 3.3.6. The last column of Table 3.3.6 shows the exact
values of y, which are given by
y = 1 + (3x2 + 9x + 15)1/3 .
(Since the differential equation in (3.3.6) is separable, this formula can be obtained by the method of
Section 2.2.)

We leave it to you to develop a procedure for handling the numerical solution of (3.3.3) on an interval
[a, b] such that a < x0 < b (Exercises 26 and 27).

3.3 Exercises
Most of the following numerical exercises involve initial value problems considered in the exercises in
Sections 3.2. You’ll find it instructive to compare the results that you obtain here with the corresponding
results that you obtained in those sections.
In Exercises 1–5 use the Runge-Kutta method to find approximate values of the solution of the given initial
value problem at the points xi = x0 + ih, where x0 is the point where the initial condition is imposed
and i = 1, 2.

CHAPTER 4
Applications of First Order Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we consider applications of first order differential equations.
SECTION 4.1 begins with a discussion of exponential growth and decay, which you have probably already seen in calculus. We consider applications to radioactive decay, carbon dating, and compound
interest. We also consider more complicated problems where the rate of change of a quantity is in part
proportional to the magnitude of the quantity, but is also influenced by other other factors for example, a
radioactive susbstance is manufactured at a certain rate, but decays at a rate proportional to its mass, or a
saver makes regular deposits in a savings account that draws compound interest.

4.1 GROWTH AND DECAY
Since the applications in this section deal with functions of time, we’ll denote the independent variable
by t. If Q is a function of t, Q0 will denote the derivative of Q with respect to t; thus,

Exponential Growth and Decay

One of the most common mathematical models for a physical process is the exponential model, where
it’s assumed that the rate of change of a quantity Q is proportional to Q; thus
Q0 = aQ,

(4.1.1)

where a is the constant of proportionality.
From Example 3, the general solution of (4.1.1) is
Q = ceat
and the solution of the initial value problem
Q0 = aQ,

Q(t0 ) = Q0

is
Q = Q0 ea(t−t0 ) .

(4.1.2)

Since the solutions of Q0 = aQ are exponential functions, we say that a quantity Q that satisfies this
equation grows exponentially if a > 0, or decays exponentially if a < 0 (Figure 4.1.1).
Radioactive Decay
Experimental evidence shows that radioactive material decays at a rate proportional to the mass of the
material present. According to this model the mass Q(t) of a radioactive material present at time t
satisfies (4.1.1), where a is a negative constant whose value for any given material must be determined
by experimental observation. For simplicity, we’ll replace the negative constant a by −k, where k is a
positive number that we’ll call the decay constant of the material. Thus, (4.1.1) becomes
Q0 = −kQ.
If the mass of the material present at t = t0 is Q0 , the mass present at time t is the solution of
Q0 = −kQ,

Q(t0 ) = Q0 .

From (4.1.2) with a = −k, the solution of this initial value problem is
Q = Q0 e−k(t−t0) .

(4.1.3)

The half–life τ of a radioactive material is defined to be the time required for half of its mass to decay;
that is, if Q(t0 ) = Q0 , then
Q0
Q(τ + t0 ) =
.
(4.1.4)

From (4.1.3) with t = τ + t0 , (4.1.4) is equivalent to

Interest Compounded Continuously
Suppose we deposit an amount of money Q0 in an interest-bearing account and make no further deposits
or withdrawals for t years, during which the account bears interest at a constant annual rate r. To calculate
the value of the account at the end of t years, we need one more piece of information: how the interest
is added to the account, or—as the bankers say—how it is compounded. If the interest is compounded
annually, the value of the account is multiplied by 1 + r at the end of each year. This means that after t
years the value of the account is
Q(t) = Q0 (1 + r)t .

Section 4.1 Growth and Decay

133

If interest is compounded semiannually, the value of the account is multiplied by (1 + r/2) every 6
months. Since this occurs twice annually, the value of the account after t years is

r 2t
.
Q(t) = Q0 1 +
2

In general, if interest is compounded n times per year, the value of the account is multiplied n times per
year by (1 + r/n); therefore, the value of the account after t years is

r nt
Q(t) = Q0 1 +
.
n

(4.1.8)

Thus, increasing the frequency of compounding increases the value of the account after a fixed period
of time. Table 4.1.7 shows the effect of increasing the number of compoundings over t = 5 years on an
initial deposit of Q0 = 100 (dollars), at an annual interest rate of 6%.

You can see from Table 4.1.7 that the value of the account after 5 years is an increasing function of
n. Now suppose the maximum allowable rate of interest on savings accounts is restricted by law, but
the time intervals between successive compoundings isn’t ; then competing banks can attract savers by
compounding often. The ultimate step in this direction is to compound continuously, by which we mean
that n → ∞ in (4.1.8). Since we know from calculus that

this yields

Observe that Q = Q0 ert is the solution of the initial value problem
Q0 = rQ,

Q(0) = Q0 ;

that is, with continuous compounding the value of the account grows exponentially.

134 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations
Example 4.1.2 If $150 is deposited in a bank that pays 5 21 % annual interest compounded continuously,
the value of the account after t years is
Q(t) = 150e.055t
dollars. (Note that it’s necessary to write the interest rate as a decimal; thus, r = .055.) Therefore, after
t = 10 years the value of the account is
Q(10) = 150e.55 ≈ $259.99.
Example 4.1.3 We wish to accumulate $10,000 in 10 years by making a single deposit in a savings
account bearing 5 21 % annual interest compounded continuously. How much must we deposit in the
account?
Solution The value of the account at time t is
Q(t) = Q0 e.055t .

(4.1.9)

Since we want Q(10) to be $10,000, the initial deposit Q0 must satisfy the equation
10000 = Q0 e.55 ,

(4.1.10)

obtained by setting t = 10 and Q(10) = 10000 in (4.1.9). Solving (4.1.10) for Q0 yields
Q0 = 10000e−.55 ≈ $5769.50.
Mixed Growth and Decay
Example 4.1.4 A radioactive substance with decay constant k is produced at a constant rate of a units of
mass per unit time.
(a) Assuming that Q(0) = Q0 , find the mass Q(t) of the substance present at time t.
(b) Find limt→∞ Q(t).
S OLUTION (a) Here
Q0 = rate of increase of Q − rate of decrease of Q.
The rate of increase is the constant a. Since Q is radioactive with decay constant k, the rate of decrease
is kQ. Therefore
Q0 = a − kQ.
This is a linear first order differential equation. Rewriting it and imposing the initial condition shows that
Q is the solution of the initial value problem
Q0 + kQ = a,

Q(0) = Q0 .

(4.1.11)

Since e−kt is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of (4.1.11) are of the form Q =
ue−kt , where u0 e−kt = a, so u0 = aekt . Hence,

This limit depends only on a and k, and not on Q0 . We say that a/k is the steady state value of Q. From
(4.1.12) we also see that Q approaches its steady state value from above if Q0 > a/k, or from below if
Q0 < a/k. If Q0 = a/k, then Q remains constant (Figure 4.1.3).
Carbon Dating
The fact that Q approaches a steady state value in the situation discussed in Example 4 underlies the
method of carbon dating, devised by the American chemist and Nobel Prize Winner W.S. Libby.
Carbon 12 is stable, but carbon-14, which is produced by cosmic bombardment of nitrogen in the upper
atmosphere, is radioactive with a half-life of about 5570 years. Libby assumed that the quantity of carbon12 in the atmosphere has been constant throughout time, and that the quantity of radioactive carbon-14

136 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations
achieved its steady state value long ago as a result of its creation and decomposition over millions of
years. These assumptions led Libby to conclude that the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 has been nearly
constant for a long time. This constant, which we denote by R, has been determined experimentally.
Living cells absorb both carbon-12 and carbon-14 in the proportion in which they are present in the
environment. Therefore the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a living cell is always R. However, when
the cell dies it ceases to absorb carbon, and the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 decreases exponentially
as the radioactive carbon-14 decays. This is the basis for the method of carbon dating, as illustrated in
the next example.
Example 4.1.5 An archaeologist investigating the site of an ancient village finds a burial ground where
the amount of carbon-14 present in individual remains is between 42 and 44% of the amount present in
live individuals. Estimate the age of the village and the length of time for which it survived.
Solution Let Q = Q(t) be the quantity of carbon-14 in an individual set of remains t years after death,
and let Q0 be the quantity that would be present in live individuals. Since carbon-14 decays exponentially
with half-life 5570 years, its decay constant is
k=

ln 2
.
5570

Therefore
Q = Q0 e−t(ln 2)/5570
if we choose our time scale so that t0 = 0 is the time of death. If we know the present value of Q we can
solve this equation for t, the number of years since death occurred. This yields
t = −5570

ln Q/Q0
.
ln 2

It is given that Q = .42Q0 in the remains of individuals who died first. Therefore these deaths occurred
about
ln .42
t1 = −5570
≈ 6971
ln 2
years ago. For the most recent deaths, Q = .44Q0; hence, these deaths occurred about
t2 = −5570

ln .44
≈ 6597
ln 2

years ago. Therefore it’s reasonable to conclude that the village was founded about 7000 years ago, and
lasted for about 400 years.
A Savings Program
Example 4.1.6 A person opens a savings account with an initial deposit of $1000 and subsequently
deposits $50 per week. Find the value Q(t) of the account at time t > 0, assuming that the bank pays 6%
interest compounded continuously.
Solution Observe that Q isn’t continuous, since there are 52 discrete deposits per year of $50 each.
To construct a mathematical model for this problem in the form of a differential equation, we make
the simplifying assumption that the deposits are made continuously at a rate of $2600 per year. This
is essential, since solutions of differential equations are continuous functions. With this assumption, Q
increases continuously at the rate
Q0 = 2600 + .06Q

Section 4.1 Growth and Decay

137

and therefore Q satisfies the differential equation
Q0 − .06Q = 2600.

(4.1.13)

(Of course, we must recognize that the solution of this equation is an approximation to the true value of
Q at any given time. We’ll discuss this further below.) Since e.06t is a solution of the complementary
equation, the solutions of (4.1.13) are of the form Q = ue.06t , where u0 e.06t = 2600. Hence, u0 =
2600e−.06t,
2600 −.06t
u=−
e
+c
.06
and
2600
+ ce.06t .
(4.1.14)
Q = ue.06t = −

Setting t = 0 and Q = 1000 here yields
c = 1000 +

and substituting this into (4.1.14) yields
Q = 1000e.06t +

2600 .06t

(4.1.15)

where the first term is the value due to the initial deposit and the second is due to the subsequent weekly
deposits.
Mathematical models must be tested for validity by comparing predictions based on them with the
actual outcome of experiments. Example 6 is unusual in that we can compute the exact value of the
account at any specified time and compare it with the approximate value predicted by (4.1.15) (See
Exercise 21.). The follwing table gives a comparison for a ten year period. Each exact answer corresponds
to the time of the year-end deposit, and each year is assumed to have exactly 52 weeks.

4.2 COOLING AND MIXING
Newton’s Law of Cooling
Newton’s law of cooling states that if an object with temperature T (t) at time t is in a medium with
temperature Tm (t), the rate of change of T at time t is proportional to T (t) − Tm (t); thus, T satisfies a
differential equation of the form
T 0 = −k(T − Tm ).
(4.2.1)

Here k > 0, since the temperature of the object must decrease if T > Tm , or increase if T < Tm . We’ll
call k the temperature decay constant of the medium.
For simplicity, in this section we’ll assume that the medium is maintained at a constant temperature Tm .
This is another example of building a simple mathematical model for a physical phenomenon. Like most
mathematical models it has its limitations. For example, it’s reasonable to assume that the temperature of
a room remains approximately constant if the cooling object is a cup of coffee, but perhaps not if it’s a
huge cauldron of molten metal. (For more on this see Exercise 17.)
To solve (4.2.1), we rewrite it as
T 0 + kT = kTm .
Since e−kt is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of this equation are of the form
T = ue−kt , where u0 e−kt = kTm , so u0 = kTm ekt . Hence,
u = Tm ekt + c,

Section 4.2 Cooling and Mixing

141

so
T = ue−kt = Tm + ce−kt .
If T (0) = T0 , setting t = 0 here yields c = T0 − Tm , so
T = Tm + (T0 − Tm )e−kt .

(4.2.2)

Note that T − Tm decays exponentially, with decay constant k.
Example 4.2.1 A ceramic insulator is baked at 400◦C and cooled in a room in which the temperature is
25◦ C. After 4 minutes the temperature of the insulator is 200◦C. What is its temperature after 8 minutes?

Example 4.2.2 An object with temperature 72◦ F is placed outside, where the temperature is −20◦ F. At
11:05 the temperature of the object is 60◦ F and at 11:07 its temperature is 50◦ F. At what time was the
object placed outside?
Solution Let T (t) be the temperature of the object at time t. For convenience, we choose the origin
t0 = 0 of the time scale to be 11:05 so that T0 = 60. We must determine the time τ when T (τ ) = 72.
Substituting T0 = 60 and Tm = −20 into (4.2.2) yields

T = −20 + 60 − (−20) e−kt

or

T = −20 + 80e−kt .

Mixing Problems
In the next two examples a saltwater solution with a given concentration (weight of salt per unit volume
of solution) is added at a specified rate to a tank that initially contains saltwater with a different concentration. The problem is to determine the quantity of salt in the tank as a function of time. This is an example
of a mixing problem. To construct a tractable mathematical model for mixing problems we assume in
our examples (and most exercises) that the mixture is stirred instantly so that the salt is always uniformly
distributed throughout the mixture. Exercises 22 and 23 deal with situations where this isn’t so, but the
distribution of salt becomes approximately uniform as t → ∞.
Example 4.2.3 A tank initially contains 40 pounds of salt dissolved in 600 gallons of water. Starting at
t0 = 0, water that contains 1/2 pound of salt per gallon is poured into the tank at the rate of 4 gal/min and
the mixture is drained from the tank at the same rate (Figure 4.2.3).
(a) Find a differential equation for the quantity Q(t) of salt in the tank at time t > 0, and solve the
equation to determine Q(t).
(b) Find limt→∞ Q(t).
S OLUTION (a) To find a differential equation for Q, we must use the given information to derive an
expression for Q0 . But Q0 is the rate of change of the quantity of salt in the tank changes with respect to
time; thus, if rate in denotes the rate at which salt enters the tank and rate out denotes the rate by which
it leaves, then
Q0 = rate in − rate out.

Determining the rate out requires a little more thought. We’re removing 4 gallons of the mixture per
minute, and there are always 600 gallons in the tank; that is, we’re removing 1/150 of the mixture per
minute. Since the salt is evenly distributed in the mixture, we are also removing 1/150 of the salt per
minute. Therefore, if there are Q(t) pounds of salt in the tank at time t, the rate out at any time t is
Q(t)/150. Alternatively, we can arrive at this conclusion by arguing that
rate out = (concentration) × (rate of flow out)
= (lb/gal) × (gal/min)

so

(4.2.6)

(Figure 4.2.4). Since Q(0) = 40, c = −260; therefore,
Q = 300 − 260e−t/150.
S OLUTION (b) From (4.2.6), we see that that limt→∞ Q(t) = 300 for any value of Q(0). This is intuitively reasonable, since the incoming solution contains 1/2 pound of salt per gallon and there are always
600 gallons of water in the tank.
Example 4.2.4 A 500-liter tank initially contains 10 g of salt dissolved in 200 liters of water. Starting
at t0 = 0, water that contains 1/4 g of salt per liter is poured into the tank at the rate of 4 liters/min and
the mixture is drained from the tank at the rate of 2 liters/min (Figure 4.2.5). Find a differential equation
for the quantity Q(t) of salt in the tank at time t prior to the time when the tank overflows and find the
concentration K(t) (g/liter ) of salt in the tank at any such time.
Solution We first determine the amount W (t) of solution in the tank at any time t prior to overflow.
Since W (0) = 200 and we’re adding 4 liters/min while removing only 2 liters/min, there’s a net gain of
2 liters/min in the tank; therefore,
W (t) = 2t + 200.
Since W (150) = 500 liters (capacity of the tank), this formula is valid for 0 ≤ t ≤ 150.
Now let Q(t) be the number of grams of salt in the tank at time t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 150. As in
Example 4.2.3,
Q0 = rate in − rate out.

To determine the rate out, we observe that since the mixture is being removed from the tank at the constant

Suppose an object with initial temperature T0 is placed in a sealed container, which is in turn placed
in a medium with temperature Tm . Let the initial temperature of the container be S0 . Assume that
the temperature of the object does not affect the temperature of the container, which in turn does
not affect the temperature of the medium. (These assumptions are reasonable, for example, if the
object is a cup of coffee, the container is a house, and the medium is the atmosphere.)
(a) Assuming that the container and the medium have distinct temperature decay constants k and
km respectively, use Newton’s law of cooling to find the temperatures S(t) and T (t) of the

use Newton’s law of cooling to find the temperatures S(t) and T (t) of the container and

(c) Find lim .t→∞S(t) and limt→∞ T (t) .

17.

In our previous examples and exercises concerning Newton’s law of cooling we assumed that the
temperature of the medium remains constant. This model is adequate if the heat lost or gained by
the object is insignificant compared to the heat required to cause an appreciable change in the temperature of the medium. If this isn’t so, we must use a model that accounts for the heat exchanged
between the object and the medium. Let T = T (t) and Tm = Tm (t) be the temperatures of the
object and the medium, respectively, and let T0 and Tm0 be their initial values. Again, we assume
that T and Tm are related by Newton’s law of cooling,
T 0 = −k(T − Tm ).

(A)

We also assume that the change in heat of the object as its temperature changes from T0 to T is
a(T − T0 ) and that the change in heat of the medium as its temperature changes from Tm0 to Tm
is am (Tm − Tm0 ), where a and am are positive constants depending upon the masses and thermal
properties of the object and medium, respectively. If we assume that the total heat of the system
consisting of the object and the medium remains constant (that is, energy is conserved), then
a(T − T0 ) + am (Tm − Tm0 ) = 0.

4.3 ELEMENTARY MECHANICS
Newton’s Second Law of Motion
In this section we consider an object with constant mass m moving along a line under a force F . Let
y = y(t) be the displacement of the object from a reference point on the line at time t, and let v = v(t)
and a = a(t) be the velocity and acceleration of the object at time t. Thus, v = y0 and a = v0 = y00 ,
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to t. Newton’s second law of motion asserts that the
force F and the acceleration a are related by the equation
F = ma.

(4.3.1)

Units
In applications there are three main sets of units in use for length, mass, force, and time: the cgs, mks, and
British systems. All three use the second as the unit of time. Table 1 shows the other units. Consistent
with (4.3.1), the unit of force in each system is defined to be the force required to impart an acceleration
of (one unit of length)/s2 to one unit of mass.

Table 1.
If we assume that Earth is a perfect sphere with constant mass density, Newton’s law of gravitation
(discussed later in this section) asserts that the force exerted on an object by Earth’s gravitational field
is proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the
center of Earth. However, if the object remains sufficiently close to Earth’s surface, we may assume that
the gravitational force is constant and equal to its value at the surface. The magnitude of this force is
mg, where g is called the acceleration due to gravity. (To be completely accurate, g should be called
the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at Earth’s surface.) This quantity has been determined
experimentally. Approximate values of g are

In general, the force F in (4.3.1) may depend upon t, y, and y0 . Since a = y00 , (4.3.1) can be written in
the form
my00 = F (t, y, y0 ),
(4.3.2)
which is a second order equation. We’ll consider this equation with restrictions on F later; however, since
Chapter 2 dealt only with first order equations, we consider here only problems in which (4.3.2) can be
recast as a first order equation. This is possible if F does not depend on y, so (4.3.2) is of the form
my00 = F (t, y0 ).
Letting v = y0 and v0 = y00 yields a first order equation for v:
mv0 = F (t, v).

(4.3.3)

152 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations
Solving this equation yields v as a function of t. If we know y(t0 ) for some time t0 , we can integrate v to
obtain y as a function of t.
Equations of the form (4.3.3) occur in problems involving motion through a resisting medium.
Motion Through a Resisting Medium Under Constant Gravitational Force
Now we consider an object moving vertically in some medium. We assume that the only forces acting on
the object are gravity and resistance from the medium. We also assume that the motion takes place close
to Earth’s surface and take the upward direction to be positive, so the gravitational force can be assumed
to have the constant value −mg. We’ll see that, under reasonable assumptions on the resisting force, the
velocity approaches a limit as t → ∞. We call this limit the terminal velocity.
Example 4.3.1 An object with mass m moves under constant gravitational force through a medium that
exerts a resistance with magnitude proportional to the speed of the object. (Recall that the speed of an
object is |v|, the absolute value of its velocity v.) Find the velocity of the object as a function of t, and
find the terminal velocity. Assume that the initial velocity is v0 .
Solution The total force acting on the object is
F = −mg + F1 ,

(4.3.4)

where −mg is the force due to gravity and F1 is the resisting force of the medium, which has magnitude
k|v|, where k is a positive constant. If the object is moving downward (v ≤ 0), the resisting force is
upward (Figure 4.3.1(a)), so
F1 = k|v| = k(−v) = −kv.
On the other hand, if the object is moving upward (v ≥ 0), the resisting force is downward (Figure 4.3.1(b)), so
F1 = −k|v| = −kv.
Thus, (4.3.4) can be written as
F = −mg − kv,

(4.3.5)

regardless of the sign of the velocity.
From Newton’s second law of motion,
F = ma = mv0 ,
so (4.3.5) yields
mv0 = −mg − kv,
or

k
v = −g.
(4.3.6)
m
Since e−kt/m is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of (4.3.6) are of the form v =
ue−kt/m , where u0 e−kt/m = −g, so u0 = −gekt/m . Hence,

Example 4.3.2 A 960-lb object is given an initial upward velocity of 60 ft/s near the surface of Earth.
The atmosphere resists the motion with a force of 3 lb for each ft/s of speed. Assuming that the only other
force acting on the object is constant gravity, find its velocity v as a function of t, and find its terminal
velocity.
Solution Since mg = 960 and g = 32, m = 960/32 = 30. The atmospheric resistance is −3v lb if v is
expressed in feet per second. Therefore
30v0 = −960 − 3v,

Since e−t/10 is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of this equation are of the form
v = ue−t/10 , where u0 e−t/10 = −32, so u0 = −32et/10 . Hence,
u = −320et/10 + c,
so
v = ue−t/10 = −320 + ce−t/10 .

(4.3.8)

The initial velocity is 60 ft/s in the upward (positive) direction; hence, v0 = 60. Substituting t = 0 and
v = 60 in (4.3.8) yields
60 = −320 + c,
so c = 380, and (4.3.8) becomes
v = −320 + 380e−t/10 ft/s
The terminal velocity is
lim v(t) = −320 ft/s.

Example 4.3.3 A 10 kg mass is given an initial velocity v0 ≤ 0 near Earth’s surface. The only forces
acting on it are gravity and atmospheric resistance proportional to the square of the speed. Assuming that
the resistance is 8 N if the speed is 2 m/s, find the velocity of the object as a function of t, and find the
terminal velocity.
Solution Since the object is falling, the resistance is in the upward (positive) direction. Hence,
mv0 = −mg + kv2 ,

where k is a constant. Since the magnitude of the resistance is 8 N when v = 2 m/s,
k(22 ) = 8,
so k = 2 N-s2 /m2 . Since m = 10 and g = 9.8, (4.3.9) becomes
10v0 = −98 + 2v2 = 2(v2 − 49).

Example 4.3.4 A 10-kg mass is launched vertically upward from Earth’s surface with an initial velocity

T required for the mass to reach maximum altitude.
Solution The mass will climb while v > 0 and reach its maximum altitude when v = 0. Therefore v > 0
for 0 ≤ t < T and v(T ) = 0. Although the mass of the object and our assumptions concerning the forces
acting on it are the same as those in Example 3, (4.3.10) does not apply here, since the resisting force is

Escape Velocity
Suppose a space vehicle is launched vertically and its fuel is exhausted when the vehicle reaches an
altitude h above Earth, where h is sufficiently large so that resistance due to Earth’s atmosphere can be
neglected. Let t = 0 be the time when burnout occurs. Assuming that the gravitational forces of all other
celestial bodies can be neglected, the motion of the vehicle for t > 0 is that of an object with constant
mass m under the influence of Earth’s gravitational force, which we now assume to vary inversely with
the square of the distance from Earth’s center; thus, if we take the upward direction to be positive then
gravitational force on the vehicle at an altitude y above Earth is
F =−

We’ll show that there’s a number ve , called the escape velocity, with these properties:

(4.3.20)

1. If v0 ≥ ve then v(t) > 0 for all t > 0, and the vehicle continues to climb for all t > 0; that is,
it “escapes” Earth. (Is it really so obvious that limt→∞ y(t) = ∞ in this case? For a proof, see
Exercise 20.)
2. If v0 < ve then v(t) decreases to zero and becomes negative. Therefore the vehicle attains a
maximum altitude ym and falls back to Earth.
Since (4.3.20) is second order, we can’t solve it by methods discussed so far. However, we’re concerned
with v rather than y, and v is easier to find. Since v = y0 the chain rule implies that

4.4 AUTONOMOUS SECOND ORDER EQUATIONS
A second order differential equation that can be written as
y00 = F (y, y0 )

(4.4.1)

where F is independent of t, is said to be autonomous. An autonomous second order equation can be
converted into a first order equation relating v = y0 and y. If we let v = y0 , (4.4.1) becomes
v0 = F (y, v).
Since

(4.4.4)

The integral curves of (4.4.4) can be plotted in the (y, v) plane, which is called the Poincaré phase plane
of (4.4.1). If y is a solution of (4.4.1) then y = y(t), v = y0 (t) is a parametric equation for an integral

Section 4.4 Autonomous Second Order Equations

163

curve of (4.4.4). We’ll call these integral curves trajectories of (4.4.1), and we’ll call (4.4.4) the phase
plane equivalent of (4.4.1).
In this section we’ll consider autonomous equations that can be written as
y00 + q(y, y0 )y0 + p(y) = 0.

(4.4.5)

Equations of this form often arise in applications of Newton’s second law of motion. For example,
suppose y is the displacement of a moving object with mass m. It’s reasonable to think of two types
of time-independent forces acting on the object. One type - such as gravity - depends only on position.
We could write such a force as −mp(y). The second type - such as atmospheric resistance or friction may depend on position and velocity. (Forces that depend on velocity are called damping forces.) We
write this force as −mq(y, y0 )y0 , where q(y, y0 ) is usually a positive function and we’ve put the factor y0
outside to make it explicit that the force is in the direction opposing the motion. In this case Newton’s,
second law of motion leads to (4.4.5).
The phase plane equivalent of (4.4.5) is
v

dv
+ q(y, v)v + p(y) = 0.
dy

(4.4.6)

Some statements that we’ll be making about the properties of (4.4.5) and (4.4.6) are intuitively reasonable,
but difficult to prove. Therefore our presentation in this section will be informal: we’ll just say things
without proof, all of which are true if we assume that p = p(y) is continuously differentiable for all y and
q = q(y, v) is continuously differentiable for all (y, v). We begin with the following statements:
• Statement 1. If y0 and v0 are arbitrary real numbers then (4.4.5) has a unique solution on (−∞, ∞)
such that y(0) = y0 and y0 (0) = v0 .
• Statement 2.) If y = y(t) is a solution of (4.4.5) and τ is any constant then y1 = y(t − τ ) is also a
solution of (4.4.5), and y and y1 have the same trajectory.
• Statement 3. If two solutions y and y1 of (4.4.5) have the same trajectory then y1 (t) = y(t − τ )
for some constant τ .
• Statement 4. Distinct trajectories of (4.4.5) can’t intersect; that is, if two trajectories of (4.4.5)
intersect, they are identical.
• Statement 5. If the trajectory of a solution of (4.4.5) is a closed curve then (y(t), v(t)) traverses
the trajectory in a finite time T , and the solution is periodic with period T ; that is, y(t + T ) = y(t)
for all t in (−∞, ∞).
If y is a constant such that p(y) = 0 then y ≡ y is a constant solution of (4.4.5). We say that y is an
equilibrium of (4.4.5) and (y, 0) is a critical point of the phase plane equivalent equation (4.4.6). We say
that the equilibrium and the critical point are stable if, for any given  > 0 no matter how small, there’s a
δ > 0, sufficiently small, such that if
q
(y0 − y)2 + v02 < δ
then the solution of the initial value problem

y00 + q(y, y0 )y0 + p(y) = 0,

y(0) = y0 ,

satisfies the inequality
p

(y(t) − y)2 + (v(t))2 < 

y0 (0) = v0

164 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations
for all t > 0. Figure 4.4.1 illustrates the geometrical interpretation of this definition in the Poincaré phase
plane: if (y0 , v0 ) is in the smaller shaded circle (with radius δ), then (y(t), v(t)) must be in in the larger
circle (with radius ) for all t > 0.

Figure 4.4.1 Stability: if (y0 , v0 ) is in the smaller circle then (y(t), v(t)) is in the larger circle for all

If an equilibrium and the associated critical point are not stable, we say they are unstable. To see if
you really understand what stable means, try to give a direct definition of unstable (Exercise 22). We’ll
illustrate both definitions in the following examples.
The Undamped Case
We’ll begin with the case where q ≡ 0, so (4.4.5) reduces to
y00 + p(y) = 0.

(4.4.7)

We say that this equation - as well as any physical situation that it may model - is undamped. The phase
plane equivalent of (4.4.7) is the separable equation
v

dv
+ p(y) = 0.
dy

Integrating this yields
v2
+ P (y) = c,
(4.4.8)
2
R
where c is a constant of integration and P (y) = p(y) dy is an antiderivative of p.
If (4.4.7) is the equation of motion of an object of mass m, then mv2 /2 is the kinetic energy and
mP (y) is the potential energy of the object; thus, (4.4.8) says that the total energy of the object remains

Assume that if the length of the spring is changed by an amount ∆L (positive or negative), then the
spring exerts an opposing force with magnitude k|∆L|, where k is a positive constant. In Section 6.1 it
will be shown that if the mass of the spring is negligible compared to m and no other forces act on the
object then Newton’s second law of motion implies that
my00 = −ky,

(4.4.9)

which can be written in the form (4.4.7) with p(y) = ky/m. This equation can be solved easily by a
method that we’ll study in Section 5.2, but that method isn’t available here. Instead, we’ll consider the
phase plane equivalent of (4.4.9).

(ρ = 2c). This defines an ellipse in the Poincaré phase plane (Figure 4.4.3).
We can identify ρ by setting t = 0 in (4.4.10); thus, ρ = mv02 + ky02 , where y0 = y(0) and v0 = v(0).

Equation (4.4.9) has exactly one equilibrium, y = 0, and it’s stable. You can see intuitively why this is
so: if the object is displaced in either direction from equilibrium, the spring tries to bring it back.
In this case we can find y explicitly as a function of t. (Don’t expect this to happen in more complicated
problems!) If v > 0 on an interval I, (4.4.10) implies that

or
y = R sin(ω0 t + φ)
for all t in I. Although we obtained this function by assuming that v > 0, you can easily verify that y
satisfies (4.4.9) for all values of t. Thus, the displacement varies periodically between −R and R, with
period T = 2π/ω0 (Figure 4.4.4). (If you’ve taken a course in elementary mechanics you may recognize
this as simple harmonic motion.)
Example 4.4.2 [The Undamped Pendulum] Now we consider the motion of a pendulum with mass m,
attached to the end of a weightless rod with length L that rotates on a frictionless axle (Figure 4.4.5). We
assume that there’s no air resistance.
Let y be the angle measured from the rest position (vertically downward) of the pendulum, as shown in
Figure 4.4.5. Newton’s second law of motion says that the product of m and the tangential acceleration
equals the tangential component of the gravitational force; therefore, from Figure 4.4.5,
mLy00 = −mg sin y,
or

g
sin y.
(4.4.13)
L
Since sin nπ = 0 if n is any integer, (4.4.13) has infinitely many equilibria yn = nπ. If n is even, the
mass is directly below the axle (Figure 4.4.6 (a)) and gravity opposes any deviation from the equilibrium.

However, if n is odd, the mass is directly above the axle (Figure 4.4.6 (b)) and gravity increases any
deviation from the equilibrium. Therefore we conclude on physical grounds that y 2m = 2mπ is stable
and y 2m+1 = (2m + 1)π is unstable.

The curves defined by (4.4.15) are the trajectories of (4.4.13). They are periodic with period 2π in y,
which isn’t surprising, since if y = y(t) is a solution of (4.4.13) then so is yn = y(t) + 2nπ for any
integer n. Figure 4.4.7 shows trajectories over the interval [−π, π]. From (4.4.15), you can see that if
|v0 | > vc then v is nonzero for all t, which means that the object whirls in the same direction forever, as in
Figure 4.4.8. The trajectories associated with this whirling motion are above the upper dashed curve and
below the lower dashed curve in Figure 4.4.7. You can also see from (4.4.15) that if 0 < |v0 | < vc ,then
v = 0 when y = ±ymax , where
ymax = 2 sin−1 (|v0 |/vc ).
In this case the pendulum oscillates periodically between −ymax and ymax , as shown in Figure 4.4.9. The
trajectories associated with this kind of motion are the ovals between the dashed curves in Figure 4.4.7.
It can be shown (see Exercise 21 for a partial proof) that the period of the oscillation is

(4.4.16)

Although this integral can’t be evaluated in terms of familiar elementary functions, you can see that it’s
finite if |v0 | < vc .
The dashed curves in Figure 4.4.7 contain four trajectories. The critical points (π, 0) and (−π, 0) are
the trajectories of the unstable equilibrium solutions y = ±π. The upper dashed curve connecting (but
not including) them is obtained from initial conditions of the form y(t0 ) = 0, v(t0 ) = vc . If y is any
solution with this trajectory then
lim y(t) = π

t→∞

and

lim y(t) = −π.

t→−∞

The lower dashed curve connecting (but not including) them is obtained from initial conditions of the
form y(t0 ) = 0, v(t0 ) = −vc . If y is any solution with this trajectory then
lim y(t) = −π

t→∞

and

lim y(t) = π.

t→−∞

Consistent with this, the integral (4.4.16) diverges to ∞ if v0 = ±vc . (Exercise 21) .
Since the dashed curves separate trajectories of whirling solutions from trajectories of oscillating solutions, each of these curves is called a separatrix.
In general, if (4.4.7) has both stable and unstable equilibria then the separatrices are the curves given
by (4.4.8) that pass through unstable critical points. Thus, if (y, 0) is an unstable critical point, then
v2
+ P (y) = P (y)
2
defines a separatrix passing through (y, 0).

Stability and Instability Conditions for y00 + p(y) = 0
It can be shown (Exercise 23) that an equilibrium y of an undamped equation
y00 + p(y) = 0

(4.4.18)

is stable if there’s an open interval (a, b) containing y such that
p(y) < 0 if a < y < y and p(y) > 0 if y < y < b.

(4.4.19)

If we regard p(y) as a force acting on a unit mass, (4.4.19) means that the force resists all sufficiently
small displacements from y.
We’ve already seen examples illustrating this principle. The equation (4.4.9) for the undamped springmass system is of the form (4.4.18) with p(y) = ky/m, which has only the stable equilibrium y = 0. In
this case (4.4.19) holds with a = −∞ and b = ∞. The equation (4.4.13) for the undamped pendulum is
of the form (4.4.18) with p(y) = (g/L) sin y. We’ve seen that y = 2mπ is a stable equilibrium if m is an
integer. In this case
p(y) = sin y < 0 if (2m − 1)π < y < 2mπ
and
p(y) > 0 if 2mπ < y < (2m + 1)π.

Section 4.4 Autonomous Second Order Equations

171

It can also be shown (Exercise 24) that y is unstable if there’s a b > y such that
p(y) < 0 if y < y < b

(4.4.20)

p(y) > 0 if a < y < y.

(4.4.21)

or an a < y such that
If we regard p(y) as a force acting on a unit mass, (4.4.20) means that the force tends to increase all
sufficiently small positive displacements from y, while (4.4.21) means that the force tends to increase the
magnitude of all sufficiently small negative displacements from y.
The undamped pendulum also illustrates this principle. We’ve seen that y = (2m + 1)π is an unstable
equilibrium if m is an integer. In this case
sin y < 0 if (2m + 1)π < y < (2m + 2)π,
so (4.4.20) holds with b = (2m + 2)π, and
sin y > 0 if 2mπ < y < (2m + 1)π,
so (4.4.21) holds with a = 2mπ.
Example 4.4.3 The equation
y00 + y(y − 1) = 0

(4.4.22)

is of the form (4.4.18) with p(y) = y(y − 1). Therefore y = 0 and y = 1 are the equilibria of (4.4.22).
Since
y(y − 1) > 0
<0

if y < 0 or y > 1,
if 0 < y < 1,

y = 0 is unstable and y = 1 is stable.
The phase plane equivalent of (4.4.22) is the separable equation

after renaming the constant of integration. These are the trajectories of (4.4.22). If y is any solution of
(4.4.22), the point (y(t), v(t)) moves along the trajectory of y in the direction of increasing y in the upper
half plane (v = y0 > 0), or in the direction of decreasing y in the lower half plane (v = y0 < 0).
Figure 4.4.10 shows typical trajectories. The dashed curve through the critical point (0, 0), obtained by
setting c = 0 in (4.4.23), separates the y-v plane into regions that contain different kinds of trajectories;
again, we call this curve a separatrix. Trajectories in the region bounded by the closed loop (b) are closed
curves, so solutions associated with them are periodic. Solutions associated with other trajectories are not
periodic. If y is any such solution with trajectory not on the separatrix, then

The Damped Case
The phase plane equivalent of the damped autonomous equation
y00 + q(y, y0 )y0 + p(y) = 0

(4.4.24)

is

dv
+ q(y, v)v + p(y) = 0.
dy
This equation isn’t separable, so we can’t solve it for v in terms of y, as we did in the undamped case,
and conservation of energy doesn’t hold. (For example, energy expended in overcoming friction is lost.)
However, we can study the qualitative behavior of its solutions by rewriting it as
v

dv
p(y)
= −q(y, v) −
dy
v

(4.4.25)

Section 4.4 Autonomous Second Order Equations

173

and considering the direction fields for this equation. In the following examples we’ll also be showing
computer generated trajectories of this equation, obtained by numerical methods. The exercises call for
similar computations. The methods discussed in Chapter 3 are not suitable for this task, since p(y)/v in
(4.4.25) is undefined on the y axis of the Poincaré phase plane. Therefore we’re forced to apply numerical
methods briefly discussed in Section 10.1 to the system
y0
v0

=

v
−q(y, v)v − p(y),

which is equivalent to (4.4.24) in the sense defined in Section 10.1. Fortunately, most differential equation
software packages enable you to do this painlessly.
In the text we’ll confine ourselves to the case where q is constant, so (4.4.24) and (4.4.25) reduce to
y00 + cy0 + p(y) = 0
and

(4.4.26)

p(y)
dv
= −c −

dy
v

(We’ll consider more general equations in the exercises.) The constant c is called the damping constant.
In situations where (4.4.26) is the equation of motion of an object, c is positive; however, there are
situations where c may be negative.
The Damped Spring-Mass System
Earlier we considered the spring - mass system under the assumption that the only forces acting on the
object were gravity and the spring’s resistance to changes in its length. Now we’ll assume that some
mechanism (for example, friction in the spring or atmospheric resistance) opposes the motion of the
object with a force proportional to its velocity. In Section 6.1 it will be shown that in this case Newton’s
second law of motion implies that
my00 + cy0 + ky = 0,
(4.4.27)
where c > 0 is the damping constant. Again, this equation can be solved easily by a method that
we’ll study in Section 5.2, but that method isn’t available here. Instead, we’ll consider its phase plane
equivalent, which can be written in the form (4.4.25) as
c
ky
dv
=− −
.
dy
m mv

(4.4.28)

(A minor note: the c in (4.4.26) actually corresponds to c/m in this equation.) Figure 4.4.11 shows a
typical direction field for an equation of this form. Recalling that motion along a trajectory must be in the
direction of increasing y in the upper half plane (v > 0) and in the direction of decreasing y in the lower
half plane (v < 0), you can infer that all trajectories approach the origin in clockwise fashion. To confirm
this, Figure 4.4.12 shows the same direction field with some trajectories filled in. All the trajectories
shown there correspond to solutions of the initial value problem
my00 + cy0 + ky = 0,

y(0) = y0 ,

y0 (0) = v0 ,

where
mv02 + ky02 = ρ

(a positive constant);

thus, if there were no damping (c = 0), all the solutions would have the same dashed elliptic trajectory,
shown in Figure 4.4.14.

Solutions corresponding to the trajectories in Figure 4.4.12 cross the y-axis infinitely many times. The
corresponding solutions are said to be oscillatory (Figure 4.4.13) It is shown in Section 6.2 that there’s
a number c1 such that if 0 ≤ c < c1 then all solutions of (4.4.27) are oscillatory, while if c ≥ c1 , no
solutions of (4.4.27) have this property. (In fact, no solution not identically zero can have more than two
zeros in this case.) Figure 4.4.14 shows a direction field and some integral curves for (4.4.28) in this case.

4.5 APPLICATIONS TO CURVES
One-Parameter Families of Curves
We begin with two examples of families of curves generated by varying a parameter over a set of real
numbers.
Example 4.5.1 For each value of the parameter c, the equation
y − cx2 = 0

(4.5.1)

defines a curve in the xy-plane. If c 6= 0, the curve is a parabola through the origin, opening upward if
c > 0 or downward if c < 0. If c = 0, the curve is the x axis (Figure 4.5.1).

y

x

Figure 4.5.1 A family of curves defined by y − cx2 = 0
Example 4.5.2 For each value of the parameter c the equation
y = x+c

(4.5.2)

defines a line with slope 1(Figure 4.5.2).
Definition 4.5.1 An equation that can be written in the form
H(x, y, c) = 0

(4.5.3)

is said to define a one-parameter family of curves if, for each value of c in in some nonempty set of real
numbers, the set of points (x, y) that satisfy (4.5.3) forms a curve in the xy-plane.

Figure 4.5.2 A family of lines defined by y = x + c

Figure 4.5.3 A family of circles defined by
x 2 + y 2 − c2 = 0

Equations (4.5.1) and (4.5.2) define one–parameter families of curves. (Although (4.5.2) isn’t in the
form (4.5.3), it can be written in this form as y − x − c = 0.)
Example 4.5.3 If c > 0, the graph of the equation
x2 + y 2 − c = 0
(4.5.4)
√
is a circle with center at (0, 0) and radius c. If c = 0, the graph is the single point (0, 0). (We don’t
regard a single point as a curve.) If c < 0, the equation has no graph. Hence, (4.5.4) defines a one–
parameter family of curves for positive values of c. This family consists of all circles centered at (0, 0)
(Figure 4.5.3).
Example 4.5.4 The equation
x 2 + y 2 + c2 = 0
does not define a one-parameter family of curves, since no (x, y) satisfies the equation if c 6= 0, and only
the single point (0, 0) satisfies it if c = 0.
Recall from Section 1.2 that the graph of a solution of a differential equation is called an integral curve
of the equation. Solving a first order differential equation usually produces a one–parameter family of
integral curves of the equation. Here we are interested in the converse problem: given a one–parameter
family of curves, is there a first order differential equation for which every member of the family is an
integral curve. This suggests the next definition.
Definition 4.5.2 If every curve in a one-parameter family defined by the equation
H(x, y, c) = 0

(4.5.5)

is an integral curve of the first order differential equation
F (x, y, y0 ) = 0,
then (4.5.6) is said to be a differential equation for the family.

(4.5.6)

Section 4.5 Applications to Curves

181

To find a differential equation for a one–parameter family we differentiate its defining equation (4.5.5)
implicitly with respect to x, to obtain
Hx(x, y, c) + Hy (x, y, c)y0 = 0.

(4.5.7)

If this equation doesn’t, then it’s a differential equation for the family. If it does contain c, it may be
possible to obtain a differential equation for the family by eliminating c between (4.5.5) and (4.5.7).
Example 4.5.5 Find a differential equation for the family of curves defined by
y = cx2 .

(4.5.8)

Solution Differentiating (4.5.8) with respect to x yields
y0 = 2cx.
Therefore c = y0 /2x, and substituting this into (4.5.8) yields
y=

xy0
2

as a differential equation for the family of curves defined by (4.5.8). The graph of any function of the
form y = cx2 is an integral curve of this equation.
The next example shows that members of a given family of curves may be obtained by joining integral
curves for more than one differential equation.
Example 4.5.6
(a) Try to find a differential equation for the family of lines tangent to the parabola y = x2 .
(b) Find two tangent lines to the parabola y = x2 that pass through (2, 3), and find the points of
tangency.
S OLUTION (a) The equation of the line through a given point (x0 , y0 ) with slope m is
y = y0 + m(x − x0 ).

(4.5.9)

If (x0 , y0 ) is on the parabola, then y0 = x20 and the slope of the tangent line through (x0 , x20) is m = 2x0 ;
hence, (4.5.9) becomes
y = x20 + 2x0 (x − x0 ),
or, equivalently,
y = −x20 + 2x0 x.

(4.5.10)

Here x0 plays the role of the constant c in Definition 4.5.1; that is, varying x0 over (−∞, ∞) produces
the family of tangent lines to the parabola y = x2 .
Differentiating (4.5.10) with respect to x yields y0 = 2x0 .. We can express x0 in terms of x and y by
rewriting (4.5.10) as
x20 − 2x0 x + y = 0
and using the quadratic formula to obtain
x0 = x ±

p
x2 − y.

(4.5.13)

Neither (4.5.12) nor (4.5.13) is a differential equation for the family of tangent lines to the parabola
y = x2 . However, if each tangent line is regarded as consisting of two tangent half lines joined at the
point of tangency, (4.5.12) is a differential equation for the family of tangent half lines on which x is less
than the abscissa of the point of tangency (Figure 4.5.4(a)), while (4.5.13) is a differential equation for
the family of tangent half lines on which x is greater than this abscissa (Figure 4.5.4(b)). The parabola
y = x2 is also an integral curve of both (4.5.12) and (4.5.13).

Geometric Problems
We now consider some geometric problems that can be solved by means of differential equations.
Example 4.5.7 Find curves y = y(x) such that every point (x0 , y(x0 )) on the curve is the midpoint of the
line segment with endpoints on the coordinate axes and tangent to the curve at (x0 , y(x0 )) (Figure 4.5.6).
Solution The equation of the line tangent to the curve at P = (x0 , y(x0 ) is
y = y(x0 ) + y0 (x0 )(x − x0 ).
If we denote the x and y intercepts of the tangent line by xI and yI (Figure 4.5.6), then
0 = y(x0 ) + y0 (x0 )(xI − x0 )

(4.5.14)

yI = y(x0 ) − y0 (x0 )x0 .

(4.5.15)

and

184 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations
From Figure 4.5.6, P is the midpoint of the line segment connecting (xI , 0) and (0, yI ) if and only if
xI = 2x0 and yI = 2y(x0 ). Substituting the first of these conditions into (4.5.14) or the second into
(4.5.15) yields
y(x0 ) + y0 (x0 )x0 = 0.
Since x0 is arbitrary we drop the subscript and conclude that y = y(x) satisfies
y + xy0 = 0,
which can be rewritten as
(xy)0 = 0.
Integrating yields xy = c, or

c
.
x
If c = 0 this curve is the line y = 0, which does not satisfy the geometric requirements imposed by the
problem; thus, c 6= 0, and the solutions define a family of hyperbolas (Figure 4.5.7).

Example 4.5.8 Find curves y = y(x) such that the tangent line to the curve at any point (x0 , y(x0 ))
intersects the x-axis at (x20 , 0). Figure 4.5.8 illustrates the situation in the case where the curve is in the
first quadrant and 0 < x < 1.
Solution The equation of the line tangent to the curve at (x0 , y(x0 )) is
y = y(x0 ) + y0 (x0 )(x − x0 ).
Since (x20 , 0) is on the tangent line,
0 = y(x0 ) + y0 (x0 )(x20 − x0 ).
Since x0 is arbitrary we drop the subscript and conclude that y = y(x) satisfies
y + y0 (x2 − x) = 0.

Orthogonal Trajectories
Two curves C1 and C2 are said to be orthogonal at a point of intersection (x0 , y0 ) if they have perpendicular tangents at (x0 , y0 ). (Figure 4.5.10). A curve is said to be an orthogonal trajectory of a given
family of curves if it’s orthogonal to every curve in the family. For example, every line through the origin
is an orthogonal trajectory of the family of circles centered at the origin. Conversely, any such circle is
an orthogonal trajectory of the family of lines through the origin (Figure 4.5.11).
Orthogonal trajectories occur in many physical applications. For example, if u = u(x, y) is the temperature at a point (x, y), the curves defined by
u(x, y) = c

(4.5.16)

are called isothermal curves. The orthogonal trajectories of this family are called heat-flow lines, because
at any given point the direction of maximum heat flow is perpendicular to the isothermal through the
point. If u represents the potential energy of an object moving under a force that depends upon (x, y), the
curves (4.5.16) are called equipotentials, and the orthogonal trajectories are called lines of force.
From analytic geometry we know that two nonvertical lines L1 and L2 with slopes m1 and m2 , respectively, are perpendicular if and only if m2 = −1/m1 ; therefore, the integral curves of the differential

This suggests a method for finding orthogonal trajectories of a family of integral curves of a first order

Therefore the integral curves of

this equation is
y = kx,
y0 =

where k is an arbitrary constant. This is the equation of a nonvertical line through (0, 0). The y axis is
also an orthogonal trajectory of the given family. Therefore every line through the origin is an orthogonal
trajectory of the given family (4.5.17) (Figure 4.5.11). This is consistent with the theorem of plane
geometry which states that a diameter of a circle and a tangent line to the circle at the end of the diameter
are perpendicular.

Therefore

By substituting u = y/x, we see that
ln |y| − ln |x| − ln(x2 + y2 ) + ln(x2 ) = ln |x| + k,
which, since ln(x2 ) = 2 ln |x|, is equivalent to
ln |y| − ln(x2 + y2 ) = k,
or
|y| = ek (x2 + y2 ).
To see what these curves are we rewrite this equation as
x2 + |y|2 − e−k |y| = 0
and complete the square to obtain
x2 + (|y| − e−k /2)2 = (e−k /2)2 .

If lines L and L1 intersect at (x0 , y0 ) and α is the smallest angle through which L must be rotated
counterclockwise about (x0 , y0 ) to bring it into coincidence with L1 , we say that α is the angle
from L to L1 ; thus, 0 ≤ α < π. If L and L1 are tangents to curves C and C1 , respectively, that
intersect at (x0 , y0 ), we say that C1 intersects C at the angle α. Use the identity
tan A + tan B
1 − tan A tan B
to show that if C and C1 are intersecting integral curves of
tan(A + B) =

y0 = f(x, y)

Linear Second Order Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we study a particularly important class of second order equations. Because of
their many applications in science and engineering, second order differential equation have historically
been the most thoroughly studied class of differential equations. Research on the theory of second order
differential equations continues to the present day. This chapter is devoted to second order equations that
can be written in the form
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F (x).
Such equations are said to be linear. As in the case of first order linear equations, (A) is said to be
homogeneous if F ≡ 0, or nonhomogeneous if F 6≡ 0.
SECTION 5.1 is devoted to the theory of homogeneous linear equations.
SECTION 5.2 deals with homogeneous equations of the special form
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0,
where a, b, and c are constant (a 6= 0). When you’ve completed this section you’ll know everything there
is to know about solving such equations.
SECTION 5.3 presents the theory of nonhomogeneous linear equations.
SECTIONS 5.4 AND 5.5 present the method of undetermined coefficients, which can be used to solve
nonhomogeneous equations of the form
ay00 + by0 + cy = F (x),
where a, b, and c are constants and F has a special form that is still sufficiently general to occur in many
applications. In this section we make extensive use of the idea of variation of parameters introduced in
Chapter 2.
SECTION 5.6 deals with reduction of order, a technique based on the idea of variation of parameters,
which enables us to find the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear second order equation provided
that we know one nontrivial (not identically zero) solution of the associated homogeneous equation.
SECTION 5.6 deals with the method traditionally called variation of parameters, which enables us to
find the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear second order equation provided that we know two
nontrivial solutions (with nonconstant ratio) of the associated homogeneous equation.

5.1 HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR EQUATIONS
A second order differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written as
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f(x).

(5.1.1)

We call the function f on the right a forcing function, since in physical applications it’s often related to
a force acting on some system modeled by the differential equation. We say that (5.1.1) is homogeneous
if f ≡ 0 or nonhomogeneous if f 6≡ 0. Since these definitions are like the corresponding definitions in
Section 2.1 for the linear first order equation
y0 + p(x)y = f(x),

(5.1.2)

it’s natural to expect similarities between methods of solving (5.1.1) and (5.1.2). However, solving (5.1.1)
is more difficult than solving (5.1.2). For example, while Theorem 2.1.1 gives a formula for the general
solution of (5.1.2) in the case where f ≡ 0 and Theorem 2.1.2 gives a formula for the case where f 6≡ 0,
there are no formulas for the general solution of (5.1.1) in either case. Therefore we must be content to
solve linear second order equations of special forms.
In Section 2.1 we considered the homogeneous equation y0 +p(x)y = 0 first, and then used a nontrivial
solution of this equation to find the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation y0 + p(x)y = f(x).
Although the progression from the homogeneous to the nonhomogeneous case isn’t that simple for the
linear second order equation, it’s still necessary to solve the homogeneous equation
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0

(5.1.3)

in order to solve the nonhomogeneous equation (5.1.1). This section is devoted to (5.1.3).
The next theorem gives sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value
problems for (5.1.3). We omit the proof.
Theorem 5.1.1 Suppose p and q are continuous on an open interval (a, b), let x0 be any point in (a, b),
and let k0 and k1 be arbitrary real numbers. Then the initial value problem
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0, y(x0 ) = k0 , y0 (x0 ) = k1
has a unique solution on (a, b).
Since y ≡ 0 is obviously a solution of (5.1.3) we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is
nontrivial. Under the assumptions of Theorem 5.1.1, the only solution of the initial value problem
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0, y(x0 ) = 0, y0 (x0 ) = 0
on (a, b) is the trivial solution (Exercise 24).
The next three examples illustrate concepts that we’ll develop later in this section. You shouldn’t be
concerned with how to find the given solutions of the equations in these examples. This will be explained
in later sections.
Example 5.1.1 The coefficients of y0 and y in
y00 − y = 0

(5.1.4)

are the constant functions p ≡ 0 and q ≡ −1, which are continuous on (−∞, ∞). Therefore Theorem 5.1.1 implies that every initial value problem for (5.1.4) has a unique solution on (−∞, ∞).

Section 5.1 Homogeneous Linear Equations

195

(a) Verify that y1 = ex and y2 = e−x are solutions of (5.1.4) on (−∞, ∞).

(b) Verify that if c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, y = c1 ex +c2 e−x is a solution of (5.1.4) on (−∞, ∞).
(c) Solve the initial value problem

y00 − y = 0,

y(0) = 1,

y0 (0) = 3.

(5.1.5)

S OLUTION (a) If y1 = ex then y10 = ex and y100 = ex = y1 , so y100 −y1 = 0. If y2 = e−x , then y20 = −e−x
and y200 = e−x = y2 , so y200 − y2 = 0.
S OLUTION (b) If
y = c1 ex + c2 e−x

(5.1.6)

y0 = c1 ex − c2 e−x

(5.1.7)

then
and
y00 = c1 ex + c2 e−x ,
so
y00 − y

= (c1 ex + c2 e−x ) − (c1 ex + c2 e−x )

= c1 (ex − ex ) + c2 (e−x − e−x ) = 0

for all x. Therefore y = c1 ex + c2 e−x is a solution of (5.1.4) on (−∞, ∞).
S OLUTION (c) We can solve (5.1.5) by choosing c1 and c2 in (5.1.6) so that y(0) = 1 and y0 (0) = 3.
Setting x = 0 in (5.1.6) and (5.1.7) shows that this is equivalent to
c1 + c2
c1 − c2

=
=

3.

Solving these equations yields c1 = 2 and c2 = −1. Therefore y = 2ex − e−x is the unique solution of
(5.1.5) on (−∞, ∞).
Example 5.1.2 Let ω be a positive constant. The coefficients of y0 and y in
y00 + ω2 y = 0

(5.1.8)

are the constant functions p ≡ 0 and q ≡ ω2 , which are continuous on (−∞, ∞). Therefore Theorem 5.1.1 implies that every initial value problem for (5.1.8) has a unique solution on (−∞, ∞).
(a) Verify that y1 = cos ωx and y2 = sin ωx are solutions of (5.1.8) on (−∞, ∞).

(b) Verify that if c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants then y = c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx is a solution of (5.1.8)
on (−∞, ∞).
(c) Solve the initial value problem

y00 + ω2 y = 0,

y(0) = 1,

y0 (0) = 3.

(5.1.9)

S OLUTION (a) If y1 = cos ωx then y10 = −ω sin ωx and y100 = −ω2 cos ωx = −ω2 y1 , so y100 + ω2 y1 = 0.
If y2 = sin ωx then, y20 = ω cos ωx and y200 = −ω2 sin ωx = −ω2 y2 , so y200 + ω2 y2 = 0.

196 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
S OLUTION (b) If
y = c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx

(5.1.10)

y0 = ω(−c1 sin ωx + c2 cos ωx)

(5.1.11)

then
and
y00 = −ω2 (c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx),
so
y00 + ω2 y

=
=

−ω2 (c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx) + ω2 (c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx)

c1 ω2 (− cos ωx + cos ωx) + c2 ω2 (− sin ωx + sin ωx) = 0

for all x. Therefore y = c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx is a solution of (5.1.8) on (−∞, ∞).
S OLUTION (c) To solve (5.1.9), we must choosing c1 and c2 in (5.1.10) so that y(0) = 1 and y0 (0) = 3.
Setting x = 0 in (5.1.10) and (5.1.11) shows that c1 = 1 and c2 = 3/ω. Therefore
y = cos ωx +

3
sin ωx
ω

is the unique solution of (5.1.9) on (−∞, ∞).
Theorem 5.1.1 implies that if k0 and k1 are arbitrary real numbers then the initial value problem
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0,

y(x0 ) = k0 ,

y0 (x0 ) = k1

(5.1.12)

has a unique solution on an interval (a, b) that contains x0 , provided that P0 , P1 , and P2 are continuous
and P0 has no zeros on (a, b). To see this, we rewrite the differential equation in (5.1.12) as
y00 +

P1 (x) 0 P2 (x)
y +
y=0
P0 (x)
P0 (x)

and apply Theorem 5.1.1 with p = P1 /P0 and q = P2 /P0 .
Example 5.1.3 The equation
x2 y00 + xy0 − 4y = 0

(5.1.13)

has the form of the differential equation in (5.1.12), with P0 (x) = x2 , P1 (x) = x, and P2 (x) = −4,
which are are all continuous on (−∞, ∞). However, since P (0) = 0 we must consider solutions of
(5.1.13) on (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞). Since P0 has no zeros on these intervals, Theorem 5.1.1 implies that the
initial value problem
x2 y00 + xy0 − 4y = 0, y(x0 ) = k0 , y0 (x0 ) = k1
has a unique solution on (0, ∞) if x0 > 0, or on (−∞, 0) if x0 < 0.
(a) Verify that y1 = x2 is a solution of (5.1.13) on (−∞, ∞) and y2 = 1/x2 is a solution of (5.1.13)
on (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞).

(b) Verify that if c1 and c2 are any constants then y = c1 x2 +c2 /x2 is a solution of (5.1.13) on (−∞, 0)
and (0, ∞).
(c) Solve the initial value problem

x2 y00 + xy0 − 4y = 0,

y(1) = 2,

y0 (1) = 0.

y(−1) = 2,

y0 (−1) = 0.

(5.1.15)

S OLUTION (a) If y1 = x2 then y10 = 2x and y100 = 2, so
x2 y100 + xy10 − 4y1 = x2 (2) + x(2x) − 4x2 = 0
for x in (−∞, ∞). If y2 = 1/x2, then y20 = −2/x3 and y200 = 6/x4, so

x = 1 in (5.1.16) and (5.1.17) shows that this is equivalent to

Solving these equations yields c1 = 1 and c2 = 1. Therefore y = x2 + 1/x2 is the unique solution of

S OLUTION (d) We can solve (5.1.15) by choosing c1 and c2 in (5.1.16) so that y(−1) = 2 and y0 (−1) =
0. Setting x = −1 in (5.1.16) and (5.1.17) shows that this is equivalent to
c1 + c2

Solving these equations yields c1 = 1 and c2 = 1. Therefore y = x2 + 1/x2 is the unique solution of
(5.1.15) on (−∞, 0).

198 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
Although the formulas for the solutions of (5.1.14) and (5.1.15) are both y = x2 + 1/x2, you should
not conclude that these two initial value problems have the same solution. Remember that a solution of
an initial value problem is defined on an interval that contains the initial point; therefore, the solution
of (5.1.14) is y = x2 + 1/x2 on the interval (0, ∞), which contains the initial point x0 = 1, while the
solution of (5.1.15) is y = x2 + 1/x2 on the interval (−∞, 0), which contains the initial point x0 = −1.
The General Solution of a Homogeneous Linear Second Order Equation

If y1 and y2 are defined on an interval (a, b) and c1 and c2 are constants, then
y = c1 y1 + c2 y2
is a linear combination of y1 and y2 . For example, y = 2 cos x + 7 sin x is a linear combination of
y1 = cos x and y2 = sin x, with c1 = 2 and c2 = 7.
The next theorem states a fact that we’ve already verified in Examples 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3.
Theorem 5.1.2 If y1 and y2 are solutions of the homogeneous equation
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0

(5.1.18)

y = c1 y1 + c2 y2

(5.1.19)

on (a, b), then any linear combination
of y1 and y2 is also a solution of (5.1.18) on (a, b).
Proof

If
y = c1 y1 + c2 y2

then
y0 = c1 y10 + c2 y20

and

y00 = c1 y100 + c2 y200 .

Therefore
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y

=

(c1 y100 + c2 y200 ) + p(x)(c1 y10 + c2 y20 ) + q(x)(c1 y1 + c2 y2 )

=

c1 (y100 + p(x)y10 + q(x)y1 ) + c2 (y200 + p(x)y20 + q(x)y2 )

=

c1 · 0 + c2 · 0 = 0,

since y1 and y2 are solutions of (5.1.18).
We say that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.18) on (a, b) if every solution of (5.1.18)
on (a, b) can be written as a linear combination of y1 and y2 as in (5.1.19). In this case we say that
(5.1.19) is general solution of (5.1.18) on (a, b).
Linear Independence
We need a way to determine whether a given set {y1 , y2 } of solutions of (5.1.18) is a fundamental set.
The next definition will enable us to state necessary and sufficient conditions for this.
We say that two functions y1 and y2 defined on an interval (a, b) are linearly independent on (a, b) if
neither is a constant multiple of the other on (a, b). (In particular, this means that neither can be the trivial
solution of (5.1.18), since, for example, if y1 ≡ 0 we could write y1 = 0y2 .) We’ll also say that the set
{y1 , y2 } is linearly independent on (a, b).
Theorem 5.1.3 Suppose p and q are continuous on (a, b). Then a set {y1 , y2 } of solutions of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0
on (a, b) is a fundamental set if and only if {y1 , y2 } is linearly independent on (a, b).

(5.1.20)

Section 5.1 Homogeneous Linear Equations

199

We’ll present the proof of Theorem 5.1.3 in steps worth regarding as theorems in their own right.
However, let’s first interpret Theorem 5.1.3 in terms of Examples 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3.
Example 5.1.4
(a) Since ex /e−x = e2x is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.3 implies that y = c1 ex + c2 e−x is the general
solution of y00 − y = 0 on (−∞, ∞).

(b) Since cos ωx/ sin ωx = cot ωx is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.3 implies that y = c1 cos ωx +
c2 sin ωx is the general solution of y00 + ω2 y = 0 on (−∞, ∞).
(c) Since x2 /x−2 = x4 is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.3 implies that y = c1 x2 + c2 /x2 is the general
solution of x2 y00 + xy0 − 4y = 0 on (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞).

The Wronskian and Abel’s Formula
To motivate a result that we need in order to prove Theorem 5.1.3, let’s see what is required to prove that
{y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.20) on (a, b). Let x0 be an arbitrary point in (a, b), and
suppose y is an arbitrary solution of (5.1.20) on (a, b). Then y is the unique solution of the initial value
problem
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0, y(x0 ) = k0 , y0 (x0 ) = k1 ;
(5.1.21)
that is, k0 and k1 are the numbers obtained by evaluating y and y0 at x0 . Moreover, k0 and k1 can be
any real numbers, since Theorem 5.1.1 implies that (5.1.21) has a solution no matter how k0 and k1 are
chosen. Therefore {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.20) on (a, b) if and only if it’s possible
to write the solution of an arbitrary initial value problem (5.1.21) as y = c1 y1 + c2 y2 . This is equivalent
to requiring that the system
c1 y1 (x0 ) + c2 y2 (x0 ) = k0
(5.1.22)
c1 y10 (x0 ) + c2 y20 (x0 ) = k1
has a solution (c1 , c2 ) for every choice of (k0 , k1 ). Let’s try to solve (5.1.22).
Multiplying the first equation in (5.1.22) by y20 (x0 ) and the second by y2 (x0 ) yields
c1 y1 (x0 )y20 (x0 ) + c2 y2 (x0 )y20 (x0 )

=

y20 (x0 )k0

c1 y10 (x0 )y2 (x0 ) + c2 y20 (x0 )y2 (x0 )

=

y2 (x0 )k1 ,

and subtracting the second equation here from the first yields
(y1 (x0 )y20 (x0 ) − y10 (x0 )y2 (x0 )) c1 = y20 (x0 )k0 − y2 (x0 )k1 .

(5.1.23)

Multiplying the first equation in (5.1.22) by y10 (x0 ) and the second by y1 (x0 ) yields
c1 y1 (x0 )y10 (x0 ) + c2 y2 (x0 )y10 (x0 )
c1 y10 (x0 )y1 (x0 ) + c2 y20 (x0 )y1 (x0 )

=
=

y10 (x0 )k0
y1 (x0 )k1 ,

and subtracting the first equation here from the second yields
(y1 (x0 )y20 (x0 ) − y10 (x0 )y2 (x0 )) c2 = y1 (x0 )k1 − y10 (x0 )k0 .

(5.1.24)

If
y1 (x0 )y20 (x0 ) − y10 (x0 )y2 (x0 ) = 0,

it’s impossible to satisfy (5.1.23) and (5.1.24) (and therefore (5.1.22)) unless k0 and k1 happen to satisfy
y1 (x0 )k1 − y10 (x0 )k0
y20 (x0 )k0 − y2 (x0 )k1

On the other hand, if
y1 (x0 )y20 (x0 ) − y10 (x0 )y2 (x0 ) 6= 0

(5.1.25)

we can divide (5.1.23) and (5.1.24) through by the quantity on the left to obtain

,
y1 (x0 )y20 (x0 ) − y10 (x0 )y2 (x0 )

(5.1.26)

no matter how k0 and k1 are chosen. This motivates us to consider conditions on y1 and y2 that imply
(5.1.25).
Theorem 5.1.4 Suppose p and q are continuous on (a, b), let y1 and y2 be solutions of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0

W = y1 y20 − y10 y2 .

Let x0 be any point in (a, b). Then

a < x < b.

(5.1.29)

Therefore either W has no zeros in (a, b) or W ≡ 0 on (a, b).
Proof

Differentiating (5.1.28) yields
W 0 = y10 y20 + y1 y200 − y10 y20 − y100 y2 = y1 y200 − y100 y2 .

(5.1.30)

Since y1 and y2 both satisfy (5.1.27),
y100 = −py10 − qy1

and

y200 = −py20 − qy2 .

Substituting these into (5.1.30) yields

−p(y1 y20 − y2 y10 ) − q(y1 y2 − y2 y1 )
−p(y1 y20 − y2 y10 ) = −pW.

Therefore W 0 + p(x)W = 0; that is, W is the solution of the initial value problem
y0 + p(x)y = 0,

y(x0 ) = W (x0 ).

We leave it to you to verify by separation of variables that this implies (5.1.29). If W (x0 ) 6= 0, (5.1.29)
implies that W has no zeros in (a, b), since an exponential is never zero. On the other hand, if W (x0 ) = 0,
(5.1.29) implies that W (x) = 0 for all x in (a, b).
The function W defined in (5.1.28) is the Wronskian of {y1 , y2 }. Formula (5.1.29) is Abel’s formula.
The Wronskian of {y1 , y2 } is usually written as the determinant
W =

which is consistent with (5.1.31).
The next theorem will enable us to complete the proof of Theorem 5.1.3.
Theorem 5.1.5 Suppose p and q are continuous on an open interval (a, b), let y1 and y2 be solutions of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0

(5.1.32)

on (a, b), and let W = y1 y20 − y10 y2 . Then y1 and y2 are linearly independent on (a, b) if and only if W
has no zeros on (a, b).
Proof We first show that if W (x0 ) = 0 for some x0 in (a, b), then y1 and y2 are linearly dependent on
(a, b). Let I be a subinterval of (a, b) on which y1 has no zeros. (If there’s no such subinterval, y1 ≡ 0 on
(a, b), so y1 and y2 are linearly independent, and we’re finished with this part of the proof.) Then y2 /y1
is defined on I, and

(5.1.33)

However, if W (x0 ) = 0, Theorem 5.1.4 implies that W ≡ 0 on (a, b). Therefore (5.1.33) implies that
(y2 /y1 )0 ≡ 0, so y2 /y1 = c (constant) on I. This shows that y2 (x) = cy1 (x) for all x in I. However, we
want to show that y2 = cy1 (x) for all x in (a, b). Let Y = y2 − cy1 . Then Y is a solution of (5.1.32)
on (a, b) such that Y ≡ 0 on I, and therefore Y 0 ≡ 0 on I. Consequently, if x0 is chosen arbitrarily in I
then Y is a solution of the initial value problem
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0,

y(x0 ) = 0,

y0 (x0 ) = 0,

which implies that Y ≡ 0 on (a, b), by the paragraph following Theorem 5.1.1. (See also Exercise 24).
Hence, y2 − cy1 ≡ 0 on (a, b), which implies that y1 and y2 are not linearly independent on (a, b).
Now suppose W has no zeros on (a, b). Then y1 can’t be identically zero on (a, b) (why not?), and
therefore there is a subinterval I of (a, b) on which y1 has no zeros. Since (5.1.33) implies that y2 /y1 is
nonconstant on I, y2 isn’t a constant multiple of y1 on (a, b). A similar argument shows that y1 isn’t a
constant multiple of y2 on (a, b), since

on any subinterval of (a, b) where y2 has no zeros.
We can now complete the proof of Theorem 5.1.3. From Theorem 5.1.5, two solutions y1 and y2 of
(5.1.32) are linearly independent on (a, b) if and only if W has no zeros on (a, b). From Theorem 5.1.4
and the motivating comments preceding it, {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.32) if and
only if W has no zeros on (a, b). Therefore {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set for (5.1.32) on (a, b) if and only
if {y1 , y2 } is linearly independent on (a, b).
The next theorem summarizes the relationships among the concepts discussed in this section.
Theorem 5.1.6 Suppose p and q are continuous on an open interval (a, b) and let y1 and y2 be solutions
of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0
(5.1.34)
on (a, b). Then the following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either all true or all false.
(a) The general solution of (5.1.34) on (a, b) is y = c1 y1 + c2 y2 .
(b) {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.34) on (a, b).
(c) {y1 , y2 } is linearly independent on (a, b).

Section 5.1 Homogeneous Linear Equations

203

(d) The Wronskian of {y1 , y2 } is nonzero at some point in (a, b).
(e) The Wronskian of {y1 , y2 } is nonzero at all points in (a, b).
We can apply this theorem to an equation written as
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0
on an interval (a, b) where P0 , P1 , and P2 are continuous and P0 has no zeros.
Theorem 5.1.7 Suppose c is in (a, b) and α and β are real numbers, not both zero. Under the assumptions of Theorem 5.1.7, suppose y1 and y2 are solutions of (5.1.34) such that
αy1 (c) + βy10 (c) = 0 and

αy2 (c) + βy20 (c) = 0.

(5.1.35)

Then {y1 , y2 } isn’t linearly independent on (a, b).
Proof

Since α and β are not both zero, (5.1.35) implies that
y1 (c)
y2 (c)

y10 (c)
y20 (c)

= 0, so

y1 (c)
y10 (c)

y2 (c)
y20 (c)

and Theorem 5.1.6 implies the stated conclusion.

5.2 CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS
If a, b, and c are real constants and a 6= 0, then
ay00 + by0 + cy = F (x)
is said to be a constant coefficient equation. In this section we consider the homogeneous constant coefficient equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0.
(5.2.1)
As we’ll see, all solutions of (5.2.1) are defined on (−∞, ∞). This being the case, we’ll omit references
to the interval on which solutions are defined, or on which a given set of solutions is a fundamental set,
etc., since the interval will always be (−∞, ∞).
The key to solving (5.2.1) is that if y = erx where r is a constant then the left side of (5.2.1) is a
multiple of erx ; thus, if y = erx then y0 = rerx and y00 = r 2 erx , so
ay00 + by0 + cy = ar 2 erx + brerx + cerx = (ar 2 + br + c)erx .

(5.2.2)

The quadratic polynomial
p(r) = ar 2 + br + c
is the characteristic polynomial of (5.2.1), and p(r) = 0 is the characteristic equation. From (5.2.2) we
can see that y = erx is a solution of (5.2.1) if and only if p(r) = 0.
The roots of the characteristic equation are given by the quadratic formula
√
−b ± b2 − 4ac
r=
.
(5.2.3)
2a
We consider three cases:

Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations

211

C ASE 1. b2 − 4ac > 0, so the characteristic equation has two distinct real roots.
C ASE 2. b2 − 4ac = 0, so the characteristic equation has a repeated real root.
C ASE 3. b2 − 4ac < 0, so the characteristic equation has complex roots.
In each case we’ll start with an example.
Case 1: Distinct Real Roots

Example 5.2.1
(a) Find the general solution of
y00 + 6y0 + 5y = 0.

(5.2.4)

(b) Solve the initial value problem
y00 + 6y0 + 5y = 0,

y(0) = 3, y0 (0) = −1.

(5.2.5)

S OLUTION (a) The characteristic polynomial of (5.2.4) is
p(r) = r 2 + 6r + 5 = (r + 1)(r + 5).
Since p(−1) = p(−5) = 0, y1 = e−x and y2 = e−5x are solutions of (5.2.4). Since y2 /y1 = e−4x is
nonconstant, 5.1.6 implies that the general solution of (5.2.4) is
y = c1 e−x + c2 e−5x .

(5.2.6)

S OLUTION (b) We must determine c1 and c2 in (5.2.6) so that y satisfies the initial conditions in (5.2.5).
Differentiating (5.2.6) yields
y0 = −c1 e−x − 5c2 e−5x .
(5.2.7)
Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 3, y0 (0) = −1 in (5.2.6) and (5.2.7) yields
c1 + c2
−c1 − 5c2

=
=

−1.

The solution of this system is c1 = 7/2, c2 = −1/2. Therefore the solution of (5.2.5) is
y=

7 −x 1 −5x
e − e
.
2

Figure 5.2.1 is a graph of this solution.
If the characteristic equation has arbitrary distinct real roots r1 and r2 , then y1 = er1 x and y2 = er2 x
are solutions of ay00 + by0 + cy = 0. Since y2 /y1 = e(r2 −r1 )x is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.6 implies that
{y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of ay00 + by0 + cy = 0.

Case 2: A Repeated Real Root

Example 5.2.2
(a) Find the general solution of
y00 + 6y0 + 9y = 0.

(5.2.8)

(b) Solve the initial value problem
y00 + 6y0 + 9y = 0,

y(0) = 3, y0 (0) = −1.

(5.2.9)

S OLUTION (a) The characteristic polynomial of (5.2.8) is
p(r) = r 2 + 6r + 9 = (r + 3)2 ,
so the characteristic equation has the repeated real root r1 = −3. Therefore y1 = e−3x is a solution
of (5.2.8). Since the characteristic equation has no other roots, (5.2.8) has no other solutions of the
form erx . We look for solutions of the form y = uy1 = ue−3x , where u is a function that we’ll now
determine. (This should remind you of the method of variation of parameters used in Section 2.1 to
solve the nonhomogeneous equation y0 + p(x)y = f(x), given a solution y1 of the complementary
equation y0 + p(x)y = 0. It’s also a special case of a method called reduction of order that we’ll study
in Section 5.6. For other ways to obtain a second solution of (5.2.8) that’s not a multiple of e−3x , see
Exercises 5.1.9, 5.1.12, and 33.

Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations

213

If y = ue−3x , then
y0 = u0 e−3x − 3ue−3x

and

y00 = u00 e−3x − 6u0 e−3x + 9ue−3x ,

so
y00 + 6y0 + 9y

=
=

e−3x [(u00 − 6u0 + 9u) + 6(u0 − 3u) + 9u]

e−3x [u00 − (6 − 6)u0 + (9 − 18 + 9)u] = u00 e−3x.

Therefore y = ue−3x is a solution of (5.2.8) if and only if u00 = 0, which is equivalent to u = c1 + c2 x,
where c1 and c2 are constants. Therefore any function of the form
y = e−3x(c1 + c2 x)

(5.2.10)

is a solution of (5.2.8). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 yields the solution y1 = e−3x that we already knew.
Letting c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 yields the second solution y2 = xe−3x . Since y2 /y1 = x is nonconstant, 5.1.6
implies that {y1 , y2 } is fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.8), and (5.2.10) is the general solution.
S OLUTION (b) Differentiating (5.2.10) yields
y0 = −3e−3x (c1 + c2 x) + c2 e−3x .

(5.2.11)

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 3, y0 (0) = −1 in (5.2.10) and (5.2.11) yields c1 = 3 and −3c1 +
c2 = −1, so c2 = 8. Therefore the solution of (5.2.9) is
y = e−3x (3 + 8x).

214 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
If the characteristic equation of ay00 + by0 + cy = 0 has an arbitrary repeated root r1 , the characteristic
polynomial must be
p(r) = a(r − r1 )2 = a(r 2 − 2r1 r + r12 ).
Therefore
ar 2 + br + c = ar 2 − (2ar1 )r + ar12 ,

which implies that b = −2ar1 and c = ar12 . Therefore ay00 + by0 + cy = 0 can be written as a(y00 −
2r1 y0 + r12 y) = 0. Since a 6= 0 this equation has the same solutions as
y00 − 2r1 y0 + r12 y = 0.

(5.2.12)

Since p(r1 ) = 0, t y1 = er1 x is a solution of ay00 + by0 + cy = 0, and therefore of (5.2.12). Proceeding
as in Example 5.2.2, we look for other solutions of (5.2.12) of the form y = uer1 x ; then
y0 = u0 er1 x + ruer1 x

and

y00 = u00 er1 x + 2r1 u0 er1 x + r12 uer1 x ,

so
y00 − 2r1 y0 + r12 y



= erx (u00 + 2r1 u0 + r12 u) − 2r1 (u0 + r1 u) + r12 u


= er1 x u00 + (2r1 − 2r1 )u0 + (r12 − 2r12 + r12 )u = u00 er1 x .

Therefore y = uer1 x is a solution of (5.2.12) if and only if u00 = 0, which is equivalent to u = c1 + c2 x,
where c1 and c2 are constants. Hence, any function of the form
y = er1 x (c1 + c2 x)

(5.2.13)

is a solution of (5.2.12). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 here yields the solution y1 = er1 x that we already
knew. Letting c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 yields the second solution y2 = xer1 x . Since y2 /y1 = x is nonconstant, 5.1.6 implies that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.12), and (5.2.13) is the general
solution.
Case 3: Complex Conjugate Roots
Example 5.2.3
(a) Find the general solution of
y00 + 4y0 + 13y = 0.

(5.2.14)

(b) Solve the initial value problem
y00 + 4y0 + 13y = 0,

y(0) = 2, y0 (0) = −3.

(5.2.15)

S OLUTION (a) The characteristic polynomial of (5.2.14) is
p(r) = r 2 + 4r + 13 = r 2 + 4r + 4 + 9 = (r + 2)2 + 9.
The roots of the characteristic equation are r1 = −2 + 3i and r2 = −2 − 3i. By analogy with Case 1, it’s
reasonable to expect that e(−2+3i)x and e(−2−3i)x are solutions of (5.2.14). This is true (see Exercise 34);
however, there are difficulties here, since you are probably not familiar with exponential functions with
complex arguments, and even if you are, it’s inconvenient to work with them, since they are complex–
valued. We’ll take a simpler approach, which we motivate as follows: the exponential notation suggests
that
e(−2+3i)x = e−2xe3ix and e(−2−3i)x = e−2x e−3ix ,

Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations

215

so even though we haven’t defined e3ix and e−3ix, it’s reasonable to expect that every linear combination
of e(−2+3i)x and e(−2−3i)x can be written as y = ue−2x, where u depends upon x. To determine u, we
note that if y = ue−2x then
y0 = u0 e−2x − 2ue−2x

and

y00 = u00 e−2x − 4u0 e−2x + 4ue−2x ,

so
y00 + 4y0 + 13y

=
=

e−2x [(u00 − 4u0 + 4u) + 4(u0 − 2u) + 13u]
e−2x [u00 − (4 − 4)u0 + (4 − 8 + 13)u] = e−2x (u00 + 9u).

Therefore y = ue−2x is a solution of (5.2.14) if and only if
u00 + 9u = 0.
From Example 5.1.2, the general solution of this equation is
u = c1 cos 3x + c2 sin 3x.
Therefore any function of the form
y = e−2x (c1 cos 3x + c2 sin 3x)

(5.2.16)

is a solution of (5.2.14). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 yields the solution y1 = e−2x cos 3x. Letting c1 = 0
and c2 = 1 yields the second solution y2 = e−2x sin 3x. Since y2 /y1 = tan 3x is nonconstant, 5.1.6
implies that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.14), and (5.2.16) is the general solution.
S OLUTION (b) Imposing the condition y(0) = 2 in (5.2.16) shows that c1 = 2. Differentiating (5.2.16)
yields
y0 = −2e−2x(c1 cos 3x + c2 sin 3x) + 3e−2x (−c1 sin 3x + c2 cos 3x),
and imposing the initial condition y0 (0) = −3 here yields −3 = −2c1 + 3c2 = −4 + 3c2 , so c2 = 1/3.
Therefore the solution of (5.2.15) is
y = e−2x (2 cos 3x +

1
sin 3x).

Figure 5.2.3 is a graph of this function.
Now suppose the characteristic equation of ay00 + by0 + cy = 0 has arbitrary complex roots; thus,

Don’t memorize these formulas. Just remember that r1 and r2 are of the form (5.2.17), where λ is an
arbitrary real number and ω is positive; λ and ω are the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of r1 .
Similarly, λ and −ω are the real and imaginary parts of r2 . We say that r1 and r2 are complex conjugates,

which means that they have the same real part and their imaginary parts have the same absolute values,
but opposite signs.
As in Example 5.2.3, it’s reasonable to to expect that the solutions of ay00 + by0 + cy = 0 are linear
combinations of e(λ+iω)x and e(λ−iω)x . Again, the exponential notation suggests that
e(λ+iω)x = eλx eiωx

and

e(λ−iω)x = eλx e−iωx ,

so even though we haven’t defined eiωx and e−iωx , it’s reasonable to expect that every linear combination
of e(λ+iω)x and e(λ−iω)x can be written as y = ueλx , where u depends upon x. To determine u we first
observe that since r1 = λ + iω and r2 = λ − iω are the roots of the characteristic equation, p must be of
the form
p(r) = a(r − r1 )(r − r2 )
= a(r
 − λ − iω)(r −
 λ + iω)
= a (r − λ)2 + ω2
= a(r 2 − 2λr + λ2 + ω2 ).

Therefore ay00 + by0 + cy = 0 can be written as


a y00 − 2λy0 + (λ2 + ω2 )y = 0.
Since a 6= 0 this equation has the same solutions as

y00 − 2λy0 + (λ2 + ω2 )y = 0.
To determine u we note that if y = ueλx then
y0 = u0 eλx + λueλx

and

y00 = u00 eλx + 2λu0 eλx + λ2 ueλx .

(5.2.18)

Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations

217

Substituting these expressions into (5.2.18) and dropping the common factor eλx yields
(u00 + 2λu0 + λ2 u) − 2λ(u0 + λu) + (λ2 + ω2 )u = 0,
which simplifies to
u00 + ω2 u = 0.
From Example 5.1.2, the general solution of this equation is
u = c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx.
Therefore any function of the form
y = eλx (c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx)

(5.2.19)

is a solution of (5.2.18). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 here yields the solution y1 = eλx cos ωx. Letting
c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 yields a second solution y2 = eλx sin ωx. Since y2 /y1 = tan ωx is nonconstant,
so Theorem 5.1.6 implies that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.18), and (5.2.19) is the
general solution.
Summary
The next theorem summarizes the results of this section.
Theorem 5.2.1 Let p(r) = ar 2 + br + c be the characteristic polynomial of
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0.

(5.2.20)

Then:
(a) If p(r) = 0 has distinct real roots r1 and r2 , then the general solution of (5.2.20) is
y = c1 er1 x + c2 er2 x .
(b) If p(r) = 0 has a repeated root r1 , then the general solution of (5.2.20) is
y = er1 x (c1 + c2 x).
(c) If p(r) = 0 has complex conjugate roots r1 = λ + iω and r2 = λ − iω (where ω > 0), then the
general solution of (5.2.20) is
y = eλx (c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx).

Given the proper background in the theory of infinite series with complex terms, it can be shown
that the series in (D) converges for all real θ.

the sequence is repetitive:
1, i, −1, −i, 1, i, −1, −i, 1, i, −1, −i, 1, i, −1, −i, · · · .

By comparing this result with (B) and (C), conclude that

This is Euler’s identity.
(b) Starting from

collect the real part (the terms not multiplied by i) and the imaginary part (the terms multiplied by i) on the right, and use the trigonometric identities

= cos θ1 cos θ2 − sin θ1 sin θ2

= sin θ1 cos θ2 + cos θ1 sin θ2

Show that if z1 = α1 + iβ1 and z2 = α2 + iβ2 then

(d) Let a, b, and c be real numbers, with a 6= 0. Let z = u + iv where u and v are real-valued
functions of x. Then we say that z is a solution of

(G)

if u and v are both solutions of (G). Use Theorem 5.2.1(c) to verify that if the characteristic
equation of (G) has complex conjugate roots λ ± iω then z1 = e(λ+iω)x and z2 = e(λ−iω)x
are both solutions of (G).

5.3 NONHOMOGENEOUS LINEAR EQUATIONS
We’ll now consider the nonhomogeneous linear second order equation
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f(x),

(5.3.1)

where the forcing function f isn’t identically zero. The next theorem, an extension of Theorem 5.1.1,
gives sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value problems for (5.3.1).
We omit the proof, which is beyond the scope of this book.
Theorem 5.3.1 Suppose p, , q and f are continuous on an open interval (a, b), let x0 be any point in
(a, b), and let k0 and k1 be arbitrary real numbers. Then the initial value problem
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f(x),

y(x0 ) = k0 ,

y0 (x0 ) = k1

has a unique solution on (a, b).
To find the general solution of (5.3.1) on an interval (a, b) where p, q, and f are continuous, it’s
necessary to find the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0

(5.3.2)

on (a, b). We call (5.3.2) the complementary equation for (5.3.1).
The next theorem shows how to find the general solution of (5.3.1) if we know one solution yp of
(5.3.1) and a fundamental set of solutions of (5.3.2). We call yp a particular solution of (5.3.1); it can be
any solution that we can find, one way or another.
Theorem 5.3.2 Suppose p, q, and f are continuous on (a, b). Let yp be a particular solution of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f(x)

(5.3.3)

on (a, b), and let {y1 , y2 } be a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = 0

(5.3.4)

on (a, b). Then y is a solution of (5.3.3) on (a, b) if and only if
y = yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 ,
where c1 and c2 are constants.

(5.3.5)

222 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
Proof We first show that y in (5.3.5) is a solution of (5.3.3) for any choice of the constants c1 and c2 .
Differentiating (5.3.5) twice yields
y0 = yp0 + c1 y10 + c2 y20

and

y00 = yp00 + c1 y100 + c2 y200 ,

so
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y

=

(yp00 + c1 y100 + c2 y200 ) + p(x)(yp0 + c1 y10 + c2 y20 )
+q(x)(yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 )

=

(yp00 + p(x)yp0 + q(x)yp ) + c1 (y100 + p(x)y10 + q(x)y1 )
+c2 (y200 + p(x)y20 + q(x)y2 )
f + c1 · 0 + c2 · 0 = f,

=

since yp satisfies (5.3.3) and y1 and y2 satisfy (5.3.4).
Now we’ll show that every solution of (5.3.3) has the form (5.3.5) for some choice of the constants c1
and c2 . Suppose y is a solution of (5.3.3). We’ll show that y − yp is a solution of (5.3.4), and therefore of
the form y − yp = c1 y1 + c2 y2 , which implies (5.3.5). To see this, we compute
(y − yp )00 + p(x)(y − yp )0 + q(x)(y − yp )

=
=
=

(y00 − yp00 ) + p(x)(y0 − yp0 )
+q(x)(y − yp )
(y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y)
−(yp00 + p(x)yp0 + q(x)yp )
f(x) − f(x) = 0,

since y and yp both satisfy (5.3.3).
We say that (5.3.5) is the general solution of (5.3.3) on (a, b).
If P0 , P1 , and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros on (a, b), then Theorem 5.3.2 implies that the
general solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F (x)
(5.3.6)
on (a, b) is y = yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 , where yp is a particular solution of (5.3.6) on (a, b) and {y1 , y2 } is a
fundamental set of solutions of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0
on (a, b). To see this, we rewrite (5.3.6) as
y00 +

P1 (x) 0 P2 (x)
F (x)
y +
y=
P0 (x)
P0 (x)
P0 (x)

and apply Theorem 5.3.2 with p = P1 /P0 , q = P2 /P0 , and f = F/P0 .
To avoid awkward wording in examples and exercises, we won’t specify the interval (a, b) when we ask
for the general solution of a specific linear second order equation, or for a fundamental set of solutions of
a homogeneous linear second order equation. Let’s agree that this always means that we want the general
solution (or a fundamental set of solutions, as the case may be) on every open interval on which p, q, and
f are continuous if the equation is of the form (5.3.3), or on which P0 , P1 , P2 , and F are continuous and
P0 has no zeros, if the equation is of the form (5.3.6). We leave it to you to identify these intervals in
specific examples and exercises.
For completeness, we point out that if P0 , P1 , P2 , and F are all continuous on an open interval (a, b),
but P0 does have a zero in (a, b), then (5.3.6) may fail to have a general solution on (a, b) in the sense
just defined. Exercises 42–44 illustrate this point for a homogeneous equation.
In this section we to limit ourselves to applications of Theorem 5.3.2 where we can guess at the form
of the particular solution.

Example 5.3.1
(a) Find the general solution of
y00 + y = 1.

(5.3.7)

(b) Solve the initial value problem
y00 + y = 1,

y(0) = 2,

y0 (0) = 7.

(5.3.8)

S OLUTION (a) We can apply Theorem 5.3.2 with (a, b) = (−∞, ∞), since the functions p ≡ 0, q ≡ 1,
and f ≡ 1 in (5.3.7) are continuous on (−∞, ∞). By inspection we see that yp ≡ 1 is a particular solution
of (5.3.7). Since y1 = cos x and y2 = sin x form a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary
equation y00 + y = 0, the general solution of (5.3.7) is
y = 1 + c1 cos x + c2 sin x.

(5.3.9)

S OLUTION (b) Imposing the initial condition y(0) = 2 in (5.3.9) yields 2 = 1 + c1 , so c1 = 1. Differentiating (5.3.9) yields
y0 = −c1 sin x + c2 cos x.
Imposing the initial condition y0 (0) = 7 here yields c2 = 7, so the solution of (5.3.8) is
y = 1 + cos x + 7 sin x.
Figure 5.3.1 is a graph of this function.
Example 5.3.2
(a) Find the general solution of
y00 − 2y0 + y = −3 − x + x2 .

(5.3.10)

(b) Solve the initial value problem
y00 − 2y0 + y = −3 − x + x2 ,

y(0) = −2,

y0 (0) = 1.

(5.3.11)

S OLUTION (a) The characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation
y00 − 2y0 + y = 0
is r 2 − 2r + 1 = (r − 1)2 , so y1 = ex and y2 = xex form a fundamental set of solutions of the
complementary equation. To guess a form for a particular solution of (5.3.10), we note that substituting a
second degree polynomial yp = A + Bx + Cx2 into the left side of (5.3.10) will produce another second
degree polynomial with coefficients that depend upon A, B, and C. The trick is to choose A, B, and C
so the polynomials on the two sides of (5.3.10) have the same coefficients; thus, if
yp = A + Bx + Cx2

then

yp0 = B + 2Cx and

yp00 = 2C,

so
yp00 − 2yp0 + yp

=
=

2C − 2(B + 2Cx) + (A + Bx + Cx2 )

(2C − 2B + A) + (−4C + B)x + Cx2 = −3 − x + x2 .

so C = 1, B = −1 + 4C = 3, and A = −3 − 2C + 2B = 1. Therefore yp = 1 + 3x + x2 is a particular
solution of (5.3.10) and Theorem 5.3.2 implies that
y = 1 + 3x + x2 + ex (c1 + c2 x)

(5.3.12)

is the general solution of (5.3.10).
S OLUTION (b) Imposing the initial condition y(0) = −2 in (5.3.12) yields −2 = 1 + c1 , so c1 = −3.
Differentiating (5.3.12) yields
y0 = 3 + 2x + ex (c1 + c2 x) + c2 ex ,
and imposing the initial condition y0 (0) = 1 here yields 1 = 3 + c1 + c2 , so c2 = 1. Therefore the
solution of (5.3.11) is
y = 1 + 3x + x2 − ex (3 − x).

of the complementary equation
x2 y00 + xy0 − 4y = 0

on (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞). To find a particular solution of (5.3.13), we note that if yp = Ax4 , where A is a
constant then both sides of (5.3.13) will be constant multiples of x4 and we may be able to choose A so
the two sides are equal. This is true in this example, since if yp = Ax4 then
x2 yp00 + xyp0 − 4yp = x2 (12Ax2 ) + x(4Ax3 ) − 4Ax4 = 12Ax4 = 2x4

if A = 1/6; therefore, yp = x4 /6 is a particular solution of (5.3.13) on (−∞, ∞). Theorem 5.3.2 implies

The Principle of Superposition
The next theorem enables us to break a nonhomogeous equation into simpler parts, find a particular
solution for each part, and then combine their solutions to obtain a particular solution of the original
problem.
Theorem 5.3.3 [The Principle of Superposition] Suppose yp1 is a particular solution of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f1 (x)
on (a, b) and yp2 is a particular solution of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f2 (x)

226 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
on (a, b). Then
yp = yp1 + yp2
is a particular solution of
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f1 (x) + f2 (x)
on (a, b).
Proof

If yp = yp1 + yp2 then
yp00 + p(x)yp0 + q(x)yp

(yp1 + yp2 )00 + p(x)(yp1 + yp2 )0 + q(x)(yp1 + yp2 )

f1 (x) + f2 (x).

It’s easy to generalize Theorem 5.3.3 to the equation
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = f(x)

(5.3.14)

where
thus, if ypi is a particular solution of

f = f1 + f2 + · · · + fk ;
y00 + p(x)y0 + q(x)y = fi (x)

on (a, b) for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, then yp1 + yp2 + · · · + ypk is a particular solution of (5.3.14) on (a, b).
Moreover, by a proof similar to the proof of Theorem 5.3.3 we can formulate the principle of superposition
in terms of a linear equation written in the form
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F (x)
(Exercise 39); that is, if yp1 is a particular solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F1 (x)
on (a, b) and yp2 is a particular solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F2 (x)
on (a, b), then yp1 + yp2 is a solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F1 (x) + F2 (x)
on (a, b).
Example 5.3.4 The function yp1 = x4 /15 is a particular solution of
x2 y00 + 4xy0 + 2y = 2x4

(5.3.15)

on (−∞, ∞) and yp2 = x2 /3 is a particular solution of
x2 y00 + 4xy0 + 2y = 4x2

(5.3.16)

on (−∞, ∞). Use the principle of superposition to find a particular solution of
x2 y00 + 4xy0 + 2y = 2x4 + 4x2
on (−∞, ∞).

In this section we consider the constant coefficient equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = eαx G(x),

(5.4.1)

where α is a constant and G is a polynomial.
From Theorem 5.3.2, the general solution of (5.4.1) is y = yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 , where yp is a particular
solution of (5.4.1) and {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0.
In Section 5.2 we showed how to find {y1 , y2 }. In this section we’ll show how to find yp . The procedure
that we’ll use is called the method of undetermined coefficients.
Our first example is similar to Exercises 16–21.

then
yp00 − 7yp0 + 12yp = 4Ae2x − 14Ae2x + 12Ae2x = 2Ae2x = 4e2x

if A = 2. Therefore yp = 2e2x is a particular solution of (5.4.2). To find the general solution, we note
that the characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation
y00 − 7y0 + 12y = 0

(5.4.3)

is p(r) = r 2 − 7r + 12 = (r − 3)(r − 4), so {e3x, e4x } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.4.3).
Therefore the general solution of (5.4.2) is
y = 2e2x + c1 e3x + c2 e4x .
Example 5.4.2 Find a particular solution of
y00 − 7y0 + 12y = 5e4x.

(5.4.4)

Then find the general solution.
Solution Fresh from our success in finding a particular solution of (5.4.2) — where we chose yp = Ae2x
because the right side of (5.4.2) is a constant multiple of e2x — it may seem reasonable to try yp = Ae4x
as a particular solution of (5.4.4). However, this won’t work, since we saw in Example 5.4.1 that e4x is
a solution of the complementary equation (5.4.3), so substituting yp = Ae4x into the left side of (5.4.4)
produces zero on the left, no matter how we chooseA. To discover a suitable form for yp , we use the same
approach that we used in Section 5.2 to find a second solution of
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0
in the case where the characteristic equation has a repeated real root: we look for solutions of (5.4.4) in
the form y = ue4x, where u is a function to be determined. Substituting
y = ue4x ,

y0 = u0 e4x + 4ue4x ,

and

y00 = u00 e4x + 8u0 e4x + 16ue4x

(5.4.5)

into (5.4.4) and canceling the common factor e4x yields
(u00 + 8u0 + 16u) − 7(u0 + 4u) + 12u = 5,
or
u00 + u0 = 5.
By inspection we see that up = 5x is a particular solution of this equation, so yp = 5xe4x is a particular
solution of (5.4.4). Therefore
y = 5xe4x + c1 e3x + c2 e4x
is the general solution.

Section 5.4 The Method of Undetermined Coefficients

231

Example 5.4.3 Find a particular solution of
y00 − 8y0 + 16y = 2e4x.

(5.4.6)

Solution Since the characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation
y00 − 8y0 + 16y = 0

(5.4.7)

is p(r) = r 2 − 8r + 16 = (r − 4)2 , both y1 = e4x and y2 = xe4x are solutions of (5.4.7). Therefore
(5.4.6) does not have a solution of the form yp = Ae4x or yp = Axe4x. As in Example 5.4.2, we look
for solutions of (5.4.6) in the form y = ue4x, where u is a function to be determined. Substituting from
(5.4.5) into (5.4.6) and canceling the common factor e4x yields
(u00 + 8u0 + 16u) − 8(u0 + 4u) + 16u = 2,
or
u00 = 2.
Integrating twice and taking the constants of integration to be zero shows that up = x2 is a particular
solution of this equation, so yp = x2 e4x is a particular solution of (5.4.4). Therefore
y = e4x (x2 + c1 + c2 x)
is the general solution.
The preceding examples illustrate the following facts concerning the form of a particular solution yp
of a constant coefficent equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = keαx ,
where k is a nonzero constant:
(a) If eαx isn’t a solution of the complementary equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0,

(5.4.8)

then yp = Aeαx , where A is a constant. (See Example 5.4.1).
(b) If eαx is a solution of (5.4.8) but xeαx is not, then yp = Axeαx, where A is a constant. (See
Example 5.4.2.)
(c) If both eαx and xeαx are solutions of (5.4.8), then yp = Ax2 eαx , where A is a constant. (See
Example 5.4.3.)
See Exercise 30 for the proofs of these facts.
In all three cases you can just substitute the appropriate form for yp and its derivatives directly into
ayp00 + byp0 + cyp = keαx,
and solve for the constant A, as we did in Example 5.4.1. (See Exercises 31–33.) However, if the equation
is
ay00 + by0 + cy = keαx G(x),
where G is a polynomial of degree greater than zero, we recommend that you use the substitution y =
ueαx as we did in Examples 5.4.2 and 5.4.3. The equation for u will turn out to be
au00 + p0 (α)u0 + p(α)u = G(x),

(5.4.9)

232 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations I
where p(r) = ar 2 + br + c is the characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation and p0 (r) =
2ar + b (Exercise 30); however, you shouldn’t memorize this since it’s easy to derive the equation for
u in any particular case. Note, however, that if eαx is a solution of the complementary equation then
p(α) = 0, so (5.4.9) reduces to
au00 + p0 (α)u0 = G(x),
while if both eαx and xeαx are solutions of the complementary equation then p(r) = a(r − α)2 and
p0 (r) = 2a(r − α), so p(α) = p0 (α) = 0 and (5.4.9) reduces to
au00 = G(x).
Example 5.4.4 Find a particular solution of
y00 − 3y0 + 2y = e3x (−1 + 2x + x2 ).

(5.4.10)

Solution Substituting
y = ue3x ,

y0 = u0 e3x + 3ue3x ,

and y00 = u00 e3x + 6u0 e3x + 9ue3x

into (5.4.10) and canceling e3x yields
(u00 + 6u0 + 9u) − 3(u0 + 3u) + 2u = −1 + 2x + x2 ,
or
u00 + 3u0 + 2u = −1 + 2x + x2 .

(5.4.11)

As in Example 2, in order to guess a form for a particular solution of (5.4.11), we note that substituting a
second degree polynomial up = A + Bx + Cx2 for u in the left side of (5.4.11) produces another second
degree polynomial with coefficients that depend upon A, B, and C; thus,
if

up = A + Bx + Cx2

then

u0p = B + 2Cx and

u00p = 2C.

If up is to satisfy (5.4.11), we must have
u00p + 3u0p + 2up

= 2C + 3(B + 2Cx) + 2(A + Bx + Cx2 )
= (2C + 3B + 2A) + (6C + 2B)x + 2Cx2 = −1 + 2x + x2 .

Equating coefficients of like powers of x on the two sides of the last equality yields
2C
2B + 6C

= −1.

Solving these equations for C, B, and A (in that order) yields C = 1/2, B = −1/2, A = −1/4.
Therefore

Example 5.4.5 Find a particular solution of

(5.4.12)

Solution Substituting
y = ue3x ,

y0 = u0 e3x + 3ue3x ,

and y00 = u00 e3x + 6u0 e3x + 9ue3x

into (5.4.12) and canceling e3x yields
(u00 + 6u0 + 9u) − 4(u0 + 3u) + 3u = 6 + 8x + 12x2 ,
or
u00 + 2u0 = 6 + 8x + 12x2 .

(5.4.13)

3x

There’s no u term in this equation, since e is a solution of the complementary equation for (5.4.12).
(See Exercise 30.) Therefore (5.4.13) does not have a particular solution of the form up = A + Bx + Cx2
that we used successfully in Example 5.4.4, since with this choice of up ,
u00p + 2u0p = 2C + (B + 2Cx)
can’t contain the last term (12x2) on the right side of (5.4.13). Instead, let’s try up = Ax + Bx2 + Cx3
on the grounds that
u0p = A + 2Bx + 3Cx2 and u00p = 2B + 6Cx
together contain all the powers of x that appear on the right side of (5.4.13).
Substituting these expressions in place of u0 and u00 in (5.4.13) yields
(2B + 6Cx) + 2(A + 2Bx + 3Cx2 ) = (2B + 2A) + (6C + 4B)x + 6Cx2 = 6 + 8x + 12x2 .
Comparing coefficients of like powers of x on the two sides of the last equality shows that up satisfies
(5.4.13) if
6C = 12
4B + 6C =
8
2A + 2B
=
6.
Solving these equations successively yields C = 2, B = −1, and A = 4. Therefore
up = x(4 − x + 2x2 )
is a particular solution of (5.4.13), and
yp = up e3x = xe3x(4 − x + 2x2 )
is a particular solution of (5.4.12).

are both solutions of the complementary

constants of integration to be zero; thus,
u0p = −2x + 6x2 + 12x3

and

up = −x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 = x2 (−1 + 2x + 3x2 ).

Therefore
yp = up e−x/2 = x2 e−x/2 (−1 + 2x + 3x2 )
is a particular solution of (5.4.14).
Summary
The preceding examples illustrate the following facts concerning particular solutions of a constant coefficent equation of the form
ay00 + by0 + cy = eαx G(x),
where G is a polynomial (see Exercise 30):
(a) If eαx isn’t a solution of the complementary equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0,

(5.4.16)

then yp = eαx Q(x), where Q is a polynomial of the same degree as G. (See Example 5.4.4).
(b) If eαx is a solution of (5.4.16) but xeαx is not, then yp = xeαxQ(x), where Q is a polynomial of
the same degree as G. (See Example 5.4.5.)
(c) If both eαx and xeαx are solutions of (5.4.16), then yp = x2 eαx Q(x), where Q is a polynomial of
the same degree as G. (See Example 5.4.6.)
In all three cases, you can just substitute the appropriate form for yp and its derivatives directly into
ayp00 + byp0 + cyp = eαx G(x),
and solve for the coefficients of the polynomial Q. However, if you try this you will see that the computations are more tedious than those that you encounter by making the substitution y = ueαx and finding
a particular solution of the resulting equation for u. (See Exercises 34-36.) In Case (a) the equation for u
will be of the form
au00 + p0 (α)u0 + p(α)u = G(x),
with a particular solution of the form up = Q(x), a polynomial of the same degree as G, whose coefficients can be found by the method used in Example 5.4.4. In Case (b) the equation for u will be of the
form
au00 + p0 (α)u0 = G(x)
(no u term on the left), with a particular solution of the form up = xQ(x), where Q is a polynomial of
the same degree as G whose coefficents can be found by the method used in Example 5.4.5. In Case (c)
the equation for u will be of the form
au00 = G(x)

with a particular solution of the form up = x2 Q(x) that can be obtained by integrating G(x)/a twice and
taking the constants of integration to be zero, as in Example 5.4.6.
Using the Principle of Superposition
The next example shows how to combine the method of undetermined coefficients and Theorem 5.3.3,
the principle of superposition.
Example 5.4.7 Find a particular solution of
y00 − 7y0 + 12y = 4e2x + 5e4x.

(5.4.17)

Solution In Example 5.4.1 we found that yp1 = 2e2x is a particular solution of
y00 − 7y0 + 12y = 4e2x,
and in Example 5.4.2 we found that yp2 = 5xe4x is a particular solution of
y00 − 7y0 + 12y = 5e4x.
Therefore the principle of superposition implies that yp = 2e2x +5xe4x is a particular solution of (5.4.17).

5.5 THE METHOD OF UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS II
In this section we consider the constant coefficient equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = eλx (P (x) cos ωx + Q(x) sin ωx)

(5.5.1)

where λ and ω are real numbers, ω 6= 0, and P and Q are polynomials. We want to find a particular
solution of (5.5.1). As in Section 5.4, the procedure that we will use is called the method of undetermined
coefficients.
Forcing Functions Without Exponential Factors
We begin with the case where λ = 0 in (5.5.1); thus, we we want to find a particular solution of
ay00 + by0 + cy = P (x) cos ωx + Q(x) sin ωx,

(5.5.2)

where P and Q are polynomials.
Differentiating xr cos ωx and xr sin ωx yields

and

d r
x cos ωx
dx
d r
x sin ωx
dx

=

−ωxr sin ωx + rxr−1 cos ωx

=

ωxr cos ωx + rxr−1 sin ωx.

This implies that if
yp = A(x) cos ωx + B(x) sin ωx
where A and B are polynomials, then
ayp00 + byp0 + cyp = F (x) cos ωx + G(x) sin ωx,
where F and G are polynomials with coefficients that can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of A
and B. This suggests that we try to choose A and B so that F = P and G = Q, respectively. Then yp
will be a particular solution of (5.5.2). The next theorem tells us how to choose the proper form for yp .
For the proof see Exercise 37.
Theorem 5.5.1 Suppose ω is a positive number and P and Q are polynomials. Let k be the larger of the
degrees of P and Q. Then the equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = P (x) cos ωx + Q(x) sin ωx
has a particular solution
yp = A(x) cos ωx + B(x) sin ωx,

where
A(x) = A0 + A1 x + · · · + Ak xk

and

B(x) = B0 + B1 x + · · · + Bk xk ,

provided that cos ωx and sin ωx are not solutions of the complementary equation. The solutions of
a(y00 + ω2 y) = P (x) cos ωx + Q(x) sin ωx
(for which cos ωx and sin ωx are solutions of the complementary equation) are of the form (5.5.3), where
A(x) = A0 x + A1 x2 + · · · + Ak xk+1

and

B(x) = B0 x + B1 x2 + · · · + Bk xk+1 .

For an analog of this theorem that’s applicable to (5.5.1), see Exercise 38.
Example 5.5.1 Find a particular solution of
y00 − 2y0 + y = 5 cos 2x + 10 sin 2x.

(5.5.4)

Solution In (5.5.4) the coefficients of cos 2x and sin 2x are both zero degree polynomials (constants).
Therefore Theorem 5.5.1 implies that (5.5.4) has a particular solution
yp = A cos 2x + B sin 2x.
Since
yp0 = −2A sin 2x + 2B cos 2x and

yp00 = −4(A cos 2x + B sin 2x),

replacing y by yp in (5.5.4) yields

(−3A − 4B) cos 2x + (4A − 3B) sin 2x.

Equating the coefficients of cos 2x and sin 2x here with the corresponding coefficients on the right side
of (5.5.4) shows that yp is a solution of (5.5.4) if

Solving these equations yields A = 1, B = −2. Therefore

y00 + 4y = 8 cos 2x + 12 sin 2x.

(5.5.5)

Solution The procedure used in Example 5.5.1 doesn’t work here; substituting yp = A cos 2x + B sin 2x
for y in (5.5.5) yields
yp00 + 4yp = −4(A cos 2x + B sin 2x) + 4(A cos 2x + B sin 2x) = 0

240 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
for any choice of A and B, since cos 2x and sin 2x are both solutions of the complementary equation
for (5.5.5). We’re dealing with the second case mentioned in Theorem 5.5.1, and should therefore try a
particular solution of the form
yp = x(A cos 2x + B sin 2x).
(5.5.6)
Then

and

yp0
yp00

= A cos 2x + B sin 2x + 2x(−A sin 2x + B cos 2x)
= −4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x − 4x(A cos 2x + B sin 2x)
= −4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x − 4yp (see (5.5.6)),

so
yp00 + 4yp = −4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x.

Therefore yp is a solution of (5.5.5) if

−4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x = 8 cos 2x + 12 sin 2x,
which holds if A = −3 and B = 2. Therefore
yp = −x(3 cos 2x − 2 sin 2x)
is a particular solution of (5.5.5).
Example 5.5.3 Find a particular solution of
y00 + 3y0 + 2y = (16 + 20x) cos x + 10 sin x.

(5.5.7)

Solution The coefficients of cos x and sin x in (5.5.7) are polynomials of degree one and zero, respectively. Therefore Theorem 5.5.1 tells us to look for a particular solution of (5.5.7) of the form
yp = (A0 + A1 x) cos x + (B0 + B1 x) sin x.

(5.5.8)

yp0 = (A1 + B0 + B1 x) cos x + (B1 − A0 − A1 x) sin x

(5.5.9)

yp00 = (2B1 − A0 − A1 x) cos x − (2A1 + B0 + B1 x) sin x,

(5.5.10)

Then
and
so

yp00 + 3yp0 + 2yp

=

[A0 + 3A1 + 3B0 + 2B1 + (A1 + 3B1 )x] cos x
+ [B0 + 3B1 − 3A0 − 2A1 + (B1 − 3A1 )x] sin x.

(5.5.11)

Comparing the coefficients of x cos x, x sin x, cos x, and sin x here with the corresponding coefficients
in (5.5.7) shows that yp is a solution of (5.5.7) if
A1 + 3B1
−3A1 + B1

−3A0 + B0 − 2A1 + 3B1

16 − 3A1 − 2B1 = −2

241

Solving these equations yields A0 = 1, B0 = −1. Substituting A0 = 1, A1 = 2, B0 = −1, B1 = 6 into
(5.5.8) shows that
yp = (1 + 2x) cos x − (1 − 6x) sin x
is a particular solution of (5.5.7).
A Useful Observation
In (5.5.9), (5.5.10), and (5.5.11) the polynomials multiplying sin x can be obtained by replacing A0 , A1 , B0 ,
and B1 by B0 , B1 , −A0 , and −A1 , respectively, in the polynomials mutiplying cos x. An analogous result applies in general, as follows (Exercise 36).
Theorem 5.5.2 If
yp = A(x) cos ωx + B(x) sin ωx,
where A(x) and B(x) are polynomials with coefficients A0 . . . , Ak and B0 , . . . , Bk , then the polynomials
multiplying sin ωx in
yp0 , yp00 , ayp00 + byp0 + cyp and yp00 + ω2 yp
can be obtained by replacing A0 , . . . , Ak by B0 , . . . , Bk and B0 , . . . , Bk by −A0 , . . . , −Ak in the
corresponding polynomials multiplying cos ωx.
We won’t use this theorem in our examples, but we recommend that you use it to check your manipulations when you work the exercises.
Example 5.5.4 Find a particular solution of
y00 + y = (8 − 4x) cos x − (8 + 8x) sin x.

(5.5.12)

Solution According to Theorem 5.5.1, we should look for a particular solution of the form
yp = (A0 x + A1 x2 ) cos x + (B0 x + B1 x2 ) sin x,

(5.5.13)

since cos x and sin x are solutions of the complementary equation. However, let’s try
yp = (A0 + A1 x) cos x + (B0 + B1 x) sin x

(5.5.14)

first, so you can see why it doesn’t work. From (5.5.10),
yp00 = (2B1 − A0 − A1 x) cos x − (2A1 + B0 + B1 x) sin x,
which together with (5.5.14) implies that
yp00 + yp = 2B1 cos x − 2A1 sin x.
Since the right side of this equation does not contain x cos x or x sin x, (5.5.14) can’t satisfy (5.5.12) no
matter how we choose A0 , A1 , B0 , and B1 .
Now let yp be as in (5.5.13). Then


yp0 = A0 + (2A1 + B0 )x + B1 x2 cos x


+ B0 + (2B1 − A0 )x − A1 x2 sin x

and



+ 2B1 − 2A0 − (B0 + 4A1 )x − B1 x2 sin x,

242 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
so
yp00 + yp = (2A1 + 2B0 + 4B1 x) cos x + (2B1 − 2A0 − 4A1 x) sin x.
Comparing the coefficients of cos x and sin x here with the corresponding coefficients in (5.5.12) shows
that yp is a solution of (5.5.12) if
4B1 = −4
−4A1 = −8
2B0 + 2A1 =
8
−2A0 + 2B1 = −8.
The solution of this system is A1 = 2, B1 = −1, A0 = 3, B0 = 2. Therefore
yp = x [(3 + 2x) cos x + (2 − x) sin x]
is a particular solution of (5.5.12).
Forcing Functions with Exponential Factors
To find a particular solution of
ay00 + by0 + cy = eλx (P (x) cos ωx + Q(x) sin ωx)

(5.5.15)

when λ 6= 0, we recall from Section 5.4 that substituting y = ueλx into (5.5.15) will produce a constant
coefficient equation for u with the forcing function P (x) cos ωx + Q(x) sin ωx. We can find a particular
solution up of this equation by the procedure that we used in Examples 5.5.1–5.5.4. Then yp = up eλx is
a particular solution of (5.5.15).
Example 5.5.5 Find a particular solution of
y00 − 3y0 + 2y = e−2x [2 cos 3x − (34 − 150x) sin 3x] .

(5.5.16)

Solution Let y = ue−2x. Then
y00 − 3y0 + 2y

= e−2x [(u00 − 4u0 + 4u) − 3(u0 − 2u) + 2u]

= e−2x (u00 − 7u0 + 12u)
= e−2x [2 cos 3x − (34 − 150x) sin 3x]

if
u00 − 7u0 + 12u = 2 cos 3x − (34 − 150x) sin 3x.

(5.5.17)

Since cos 3x and sin 3x aren’t solutions of the complementary equation
u00 − 7u0 + 12u = 0,
Theorem 5.5.1 tells us to look for a particular solution of (5.5.17) of the form
up = (A0 + A1 x) cos 3x + (B0 + B1 x) sin 3x.
Then

(5.5.18)

so
u00p − 7u0p + 12up

=

[3A0 − 21B0 − 7A1 + 6B1 + (3A1 − 21B1 )x] cos 3x
+ [21A0 + 3B0 − 6A1 − 7B1 + (21A1 + 3B1 )x] sin 3x.

Comparing the coefficients of x cos 3x, x sin 3x, cos 3x, and sin 3x here with the corresponding coefficients on the right side of (5.5.17) shows that up is a solution of (5.5.17) if
3A1 − 21B1

(5.5.19)

Solving the first two equations yields A1 = 7, B1 = 1. Substituting these values into the last two

21A0 + 3B0

=
2 + 7A1 − 6B1 = 45
= −34 + 6A1 + 7B1 = 15.

Solving this system yields A0 = 1, B0 = −2. Substituting A0 = 1, A1 = 7, B0 = −2, and B1 = 1 into
(5.5.18) shows that
up = (1 + 7x) cos 3x − (2 − x) sin 3x
is a particular solution of (5.5.17). Therefore
yp = e−2x [(1 + 7x) cos 3x − (2 − x) sin 3x]
is a particular solution of (5.5.16).
Example 5.5.6 Find a particular solution of
y00 + 2y0 + 5y = e−x [(6 − 16x) cos 2x − (8 + 8x) sin 2x] .

(5.5.20)

Solution Let y = ue−x . Then

if
u00 + 4u = (6 − 16x) cos 2x − (8 + 8x) sin 2x.
Since cos 2x and sin 2x are solutions of the complementary equation
u00 + 4u = 0,
Theorem 5.5.1 tells us to look for a particular solution of (5.5.21) of the form
up = (A0 x + A1 x2 ) cos 2x + (B0 x + B1 x2 ) sin 2x.

(5.5.22)

The solution of this system is A1 = 1, B1 = −2, B0 = 1, A0 = 1. Therefore
up = x[(1 + x) cos 2x + (1 − 2x) sin 2x]
is a particular solution of (5.5.21), and
yp = xe−x [(1 + x) cos 2x + (1 − 2x) sin 2x]
is a particular solution of (5.5.20).
You can also find a particular solution of (5.5.20) by substituting
yp = xe−x [(A0 + A1 x) cos 2x + (B0 + B1 x) sin 2x]
for y in (5.5.20) and equating the coefficients of xe−x cos 2x, xe−x sin 2x, e−x cos 2x, and e−x sin 2x in
the resulting expression for
yp00 + 2yp0 + 5yp
with the corresponding coefficients on the right side of (5.5.20). (See Exercise 38). This leads to the same
system (5.5.22) of equations for A0 , A1 , B0 , and B1 that we obtained in Example 5.5.6. However, if you
try this approach you’ll see that deriving (5.5.22) this way is much more tedious than the way we did it
in Example 5.5.6.

5.6 REDUCTION OF ORDER
In this section we give a method for finding the general solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F (x)

(5.6.1)

if we know a nontrivial solution y1 of the complementary equation
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0.

(5.6.2)

The method is called reduction of order because it reduces the task of solving (5.6.1) to solving a first
order equation. Unlike the method of undetermined coefficients, it does not require P0 , P1 , and P2 to be
constants, or F to be of any special form.

Section 5.6 Reduction of Order

249

By now you shoudn’t be surprised that we look for solutions of (5.6.1) in the form
y = uy1

(5.6.3)

where u is to be determined so that y satisfies (5.6.1). Substituting (5.6.3) and
y0
y00

=
=

u0 y1 + uy10
u00 y1 + 2u0 y10 + uy100

into (5.6.1) yields
P0 (x)(u00 y1 + 2u0 y10 + uy100 ) + P1 (x)(u0 y1 + uy10 ) + P2 (x)uy1 = F (x).
Collecting the coefficients of u, u0 , and u00 yields
(P0 y1 )u00 + (2P0 y10 + P1 y1 )u0 + (P0 y100 + P1 y10 + P2 y1 )u = F.

(5.6.4)

However, the coefficient of u is zero, since y1 satisfies (5.6.2). Therefore (5.6.4) reduces to
Q0 (x)u00 + Q1 (x)u0 = F,

(5.6.5)

with
Q0 = P0 y1

and

Q1 = 2P0 y10 + P1 y1 .

(It isn’t worthwhile to memorize the formulas for Q0 and Q1 !) Since (5.6.5) is a linear first order equation
in u0 , we can solve it for u0 by variation of parameters as in Section 1.2, integrate the solution to obtain
u, and then obtain y from (5.6.3).
Example 5.6.1
(a) Find the general solution of
xy00 − (2x + 1)y0 + (x + 1)y = x2 ,

(5.6.6)

given that y1 = ex is a solution of the complementary equation
xy00 − (2x + 1)y0 + (x + 1)y = 0.

(5.6.7)

(b) As a byproduct of (a), find a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.7).
S OLUTION (a) If y = uex , then y0 = u0 ex + uex and y00 = u00 ex + 2u0 ex + uex , so
xy00 − (2x + 1)y0 + (x + 1)y

=
=

x(u00 ex + 2u0 ex + uex )
−(2x + 1)(u0 ex + uex ) + (x + 1)uex
(xu00 − u0 )ex .

Therefore y = uex is a solution of (5.6.6) if and only if
(xu00 − u0 )ex = x2 ,
which is a first order equation in u0 . We rewrite it as
u00 −

u0
= xe−x .
x

(5.6.8)

250 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
To focus on how we apply variation of parameters to this equation, we temporarily write z = u0 , so that
(5.6.8) becomes
z
z 0 − = xe−x .
(5.6.9)
x
We leave it to you to show (by separation of variables) that z1 = x is a solution of the complementary
equation
z
z0 − = 0
x
for (5.6.9). By applying variation of parameters as in Section 1.2, we can now see that every solution of
(5.6.9) is of the form
z = vx

where

v0 x = xe−x,

so

v0 = e−x

and

v = −e−x + C1 .

Since u0 = z = vx, u is a solution of (5.6.8) if and only if
u0 = vx = −xe−x + C1 x.
Integrating this yields
u = (x + 1)e−x +

C1 2
x + C2 .
2

Therefore the general solution of (5.6.6) is
y = uex = x + 1 +

C1 2 x
x e + C2 ex .
2

(5.6.10)

S OLUTION (b) By letting C1 = C2 = 0 in (5.6.10), we see that yp1 = x + 1 is a solution of (5.6.6). By
letting C1 = 2 and C2 = 0, we see that yp2 = x+1+x2 ex is also a solution of (5.6.6). Since the difference
of two solutions of (5.6.6) is a solution of (5.6.7), y2 = yp1 − yp2 = x2 ex is a solution of (5.6.7). Since
y2 /y1 is nonconstant and we already know that y1 = ex is a solution of (5.6.6), Theorem 5.1.6 implies
that {ex , x2 ex } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.7).
Although (5.6.10) is a correct form for the general solution of (5.6.6), it’s silly to leave the arbitrary coefficient of x2 ex as C1 /2 where C1 is an arbitrary constant. Moreover, it’s sensible to make the subscripts
of the coefficients of y1 = ex and y2 = x2 ex consistent with the subscripts of the functions themselves.
Therefore we rewrite (5.6.10) as
y = x + 1 + c1 ex + c2 x2 ex
by simply renaming the arbitrary constants. We’ll also do this in the next two examples, and in the
answers to the exercises.
Example 5.6.2
(a) Find the general solution of
x2 y00 + xy0 − y = x2 + 1,
given that y1 = x is a solution of the complementary equation
x2 y00 + xy0 − y = 0.

(5.6.11)

As a byproduct of this result, find a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.11).
(b) Solve the initial value problem
x2 y00 + xy0 − y = x2 + 1,

y(1) = 2, y0 (1) = −3.

(5.6.12)

Section 5.6 Reduction of Order

251

S OLUTION (a) If y = ux, then y0 = u0 x + u and y00 = u00 x + 2u0 , so
x2 y00 + xy0 − y

x2 (u00 x + 2u0 ) + x(u0 x + u) − ux
x3 u00 + 3x2 u0 .

=
=

Therefore y = ux is a solution of (5.6.12) if and only if
x3 u00 + 3x2 u0 = x2 + 1,
which is a first order equation in u0 . We rewrite it as
u00 +

(5.6.13)

To focus on how we apply variation of parameters to this equation, we temporarily write z = u0 , so that
(5.6.13) becomes

z0 + z = + 3 .
(5.6.14)
x

We leave it to you to show by separation of variables that z1 = 1/x3 is a solution of the complementary

where

v0

x3
x x

so

v 0 = x2 + 1

and

v=

Since u0 = z = v/x3 , u is a solution of (5.6.14) if and only if
u0 =

Therefore the general solution of (5.6.12) is

(5.6.15)

Reasoning as in the solution of Example 5.6.1(a), we conclude that y1 = x and y2 = 1/x form a
fundamental set of solutions for (5.6.11).
As we explained above, we rename the constants in (5.6.15) and rewrite it as
y=

(5.6.16)

S OLUTION (b) Differentiating (5.6.16) yields
y0 =

(5.6.17)

252 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
Setting x = 1 in (5.6.16) and (5.6.17) and imposing the initial conditions y(1) = 2 and y0 (1) = −3
yields

c1 − c2

Using reduction of order to find the general solution of a homogeneous linear second order equation
leads to a homogeneous linear first order equation in u0 that can be solved by separation of variables. The
next example illustrates this.
Example 5.6.3 Find the general solution and a fundamental set of solutions of
x2 y00 − 3xy0 + 3y = 0,

(5.6.18)

given that y1 = x is a solution.
Solution If y = ux then y0 = u0 x + u and y00 = u00 x + 2u0 , so
x2 y00 − 3xy0 + 3y

x2 (u00 x + 2u0 ) − 3x(u0 x + u) + 3ux

=

x3 u00 − x2 u0 .

=

Therefore y = ux is a solution of (5.6.18) if and only if
x3 u00 − x2 u0 = 0.
Separating the variables u0 and x yields

u00
1
= ,
0
u
x

so
Therefore

ln |u0 | = ln |x| + k,
u=

or, equivalently,

u0 = C1 x.

C1 2
x + C2 ,
2

so the general solution of (5.6.18) is
y = ux =

C1 3
x + C2 x,
2

which we rewrite as
y = c1 x + c2 x 3 .
Therefore {x, x3 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.18).

5.7 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS
In this section we give a method called variation of parameters for finding a particular solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F (x)

(5.7.1)

if we know a fundamental set {y1 , y2 } of solutions of the complementary equation
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0.

(5.7.2)

Having found a particular solution yp by this method, we can write the general solution of (5.7.1) as
y = yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 .
Since we need only one nontrivial solution of (5.7.2) to find the general solution of (5.7.1) by reduction
of order, it’s natural to ask why we’re interested in variation of parameters, which requires two linearly
independent solutions of (5.7.2) to achieve the same goal. Here’s the answer:
• If we already know two linearly independent solutions of (5.7.2) then variation of parameters will
probably be simpler than reduction of order.
• Variation of parameters generalizes naturally to a method for finding particular solutions of higher
order linear equations (Section 9.4) and linear systems of equations (Section 10.7), while reduction
of order doesn’t.
• Variation of parameters is a powerful theoretical tool used by researchers in differential equations.
Although a detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of this book, you can get an idea of what
it means from Exercises 37–39.

256 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations
We’ll now derive the method. As usual, we consider solutions of (5.7.1) and (5.7.2) on an interval (a, b)
where P0 , P1 , P2 , and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros. Suppose that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental
set of solutions of the complementary equation (5.7.2). We look for a particular solution of (5.7.1) in the
form
yp = u1 y1 + u2 y2
(5.7.3)
where u1 and u2 are functions to be determined so that yp satisfies (5.7.1). You may not think this is a
good idea, since there are now two unknown functions to be determined, rather than one. However, since
u1 and u2 have to satisfy only one condition (that yp is a solution of (5.7.1)), we can impose a second
condition that produces a convenient simplification, as follows.
Differentiating (5.7.3) yields
yp0 = u1 y10 + u2 y20 + u01 y1 + u02 y2 .

(5.7.4)

As our second condition on u1 and u2 we require that
u01 y1 + u02 y2 = 0.

(5.7.5)

yp0 = u1 y10 + u2 y20 ;

(5.7.6)

Then (5.7.4) becomes
that is, (5.7.5) permits us to differentiate yp (once!) as if u1 and u2 are constants. Differentiating (5.7.4)
yields
yp00 = u1 y100 + u2 y200 + u01 y10 + u02 y20 .
(5.7.7)
(There are no terms involving u001 and u002 here, as there would be if we hadn’t required (5.7.5).) Substituting (5.7.3), (5.7.6), and (5.7.7) into (5.7.1) and collecting the coefficients of u1 and u2 yields
u1 (P0 y100 + P1 y10 + P2 y1 ) + u2 (P0 y200 + P1 y20 + P2 y2 ) + P0 (u01 y10 + u02 y20 ) = F.
As in the derivation of the method of reduction of order, the coefficients of u1 and u2 here are both zero
because y1 and y2 satisfy the complementary equation. Hence, we can rewrite the last equation as
P0 (u01 y10 + u02 y20 ) = F.

(5.7.8)

Therefore yp in (5.7.3) satisfies (5.7.1) if
u01 y1 + u02 y2

u02 y20

= 0
F
=
,
P0

(5.7.9)

where the first equation is the same as (5.7.5) and the second is from (5.7.8).
We’ll now show that you can always solve (5.7.9) for u01 and u02 . (The method that we use here will
always work, but simpler methods usually work when you’re dealing with specific equations.) To obtain
u01 , multiply the first equation in (5.7.9) by y20 and the second equation by y2 . This yields
u01 y1 y20 + u02 y2 y20
u01 y10 y2 + u02 y20 y2

= 0
F y2

Subtracting the second equation from the first yields
u01 (y1 y20 − y10 y2 ) = −

F y2

P0

(5.7.10)

Section 5.7 Variation of Parameters

257

Since {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.7.2) on (a, b), Theorem 5.1.6 implies that the
Wronskian y1 y20 − y10 y2 has no zeros on (a, b). Therefore we can solve (5.7.10) for u01 , to obtain
u01 = −

F y2
.
P0 (y1 y20 − y10 y2 )

(5.7.11)

We leave it to you to start from (5.7.9) and show by a similar argument that
u02 =

F y1
.
P0 (y1 y20 − y10 y2 )

(5.7.12)

We can now obtain u1 and u2 by integrating u01 and u02 . The constants of integration can be taken to be
zero, since any choice of u1 and u2 in (5.7.3) will suffice.
You should not memorize (5.7.11) and (5.7.12). On the other hand, you don’t want to rederive the
whole procedure for every specific problem. We recommend the a compromise:
(a) Write
yp = u1 y1 + u2 y2
(5.7.13)
to remind yourself of what you’re doing.
(b) Write the system
u01 y1 + u02 y2

=

u01 y10 + u02 y20

=

(5.7.14)

for the specific problem you’re trying to solve.
(c) Solve (5.7.14) for u01 and u02 by any convenient method.
(d) Obtain u1 and u2 by integrating u01 and u02 , taking the constants of integration to be zero.
(e) Substitute u1 and u2 into (5.7.13) to obtain yp .
Example 5.7.1 Find a particular solution yp of
x2 y00 − 2xy0 + 2y = x9/2 ,

(5.7.15)

given that y1 = x and y2 = x2 are solutions of the complementary equation
x2 y00 − 2xy0 + 2y = 0.
Then find the general solution of (5.7.15).
Solution We set
yp = u1 x + u2 x2 ,
where
u01 x + u02 x2

=

u01 + 2u02 x

=

= x5/2 .
x2

From the first equation, u01 = −u02 x. Substituting this into the second equation yields u02 x = x5/2 , so
u02 = x3/2 and therefore u01 = −u02 x = −x5/2 . Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be
zero yields

u1 = − x7/2 and u2 = x5/2 .

Example 5.7.2 Find a particular solution yp of
(x − 1)y00 − xy0 + y = (x − 1)2 ,

(5.7.16)

given that y1 = x and y2 = ex are solutions of the complementary equation
(x − 1)y00 − xy0 + y = 0.
Then find the general solution of (5.7.16).
Solution We set
yp = u1 x + u2 ex ,
where
u01 x + u02 ex

=

(x − 1)2

x−1

Subtracting the first equation from the second yields −u01 (x − 1) = x − 1, so u01 = −1. From this and
the first equation, u02 = −xe−x u01 = xe−x . Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be zero
yields
u1 = −x and u2 = −(x + 1)e−x .
Therefore
yp = u1 x + u2 ex = (−x)x + (−(x + 1)e−x )ex = −x2 − x − 1,
so the general solution of (5.7.16) is
y = yp + c1 x + c2 ex = −x2 − x − 1 + c1 x + c2 ex = −x2 − 1 + (c1 − 1)x + c2 ex .

(5.7.17)

However, since c1 is an arbitrary constant, so is c1 −1; therefore, we improve the appearance of this result
by renaming the constant and writing the general solution as
y = −x2 − 1 + c1 x + c2 ex .

(5.7.18)

There’s nothing wrong with leaving the general solution of (5.7.16) in the form (5.7.17); however, we
think you’ll agree that (5.7.18) is preferable. We can also view the transition from (5.7.17) to (5.7.18)
differently. In this example the particular solution yp = −x2 −x−1 contained the term −x, which satisfies
the complementary equation. We can drop this term and redefine yp = −x2 − 1, since −x2 − x − 1 is a
solution of (5.7.16) and x is a solution of the complementary equation; hence, −x2 −1 = (−x2 −x−1)+x
is also a solution of (5.7.16). In general, it’s always legitimate to drop linear combinations of {y1 , y2 }
from particular solutions obtained by variation of parameters. (See Exercise 36 for a general discussion
of this question.) We’ll do this in the following examples and in the answers to exercises that ask for a
particular solution. Therefore, don’t be concerned if your answer to such an exercise differs from ours
only by a solution of the complementary equation.

Comparison of Methods
We’ve now considered three methods for solving nonhomogeneous linear equations: undetermined coefficients, reduction of order, and variation of parameters. It’s natural to ask which method is best for a
given problem. The method of undetermined coefficients should be used for constant coefficient equations with forcing functions that are linear combinations of polynomials multiplied by functions of the
form eαx , eλx cos ωx, or eλx sin ωx. Although the other two methods can be used to solve such problems,
they will be more difficult except in the most trivial cases, because of the integrations involved.
If the equation isn’t a constant coefficient equation or the forcing function isn’t of the form just specified, the method of undetermined coefficients does not apply and the choice is necessarily between the
other two methods. The case could be made that reduction of order is better because it requires only
one solution of the complementary equation while variation of parameters requires two. However, variation of parameters will probably be easier if you already know a fundamental set of solutions of the
complementary equation.

SECTION 6.2 is about RLC circuits, the electrical analogs of spring–mass systems.

motion under a central force.

268 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations
6.1 SPRING PROBLEMS I
We consider the motion of an object of mass m, suspended from a spring of negligible mass. We say that
the spring–mass system is in equilibrium when the object is at rest and the forces acting on it sum to zero.
The position of the object in this case is the equilibrium position. We define y to be the displacement of
the object from its equilibrium position (Figure 6.1.1), measured positive upward.

Figure 6.1.1 (a) y > 0 (b) y = 0, (c) y < 0

Figure 6.1.2 A spring – mass system with damping

Our model accounts for the following kinds of forces acting on the object:
• The force −mg, due to gravity.
• A force Fs exerted by the spring resisting change in its length. The natural length of the spring
is its length with no mass attached. We assume that the spring obeys Hooke’s law: If the length
of the spring is changed by an amount ∆L from its natural length, then the spring exerts a force
Fs = k∆L, where k is a positive number called the spring constant. If the spring is stretched then
∆L > 0 and Fs > 0, so the spring force is upward, while if the spring is compressed then ∆L < 0
and Fs < 0, so the spring force is downward.
• A damping force Fd = −cy0 that resists the motion with a force proportional to the velocity of
the object. It may be due to air resistance or friction in the spring. However, a convenient way to
visualize a damping force is to assume that the object is rigidly attached to a piston with negligible
mass immersed in a cylinder (called a dashpot) filled with a viscous liquid (Figure 6.1.2). As the
piston moves, the liquid exerts a damping force. We say that the motion is undamped if c = 0, or
damped if c > 0.
• An external force F , other than the force due to gravity, that may vary with t, but is independent of
displacement and velocity. We say that the motion is free if F ≡ 0, or forced if F 6≡ 0.
From Newton’s second law of motion,
my00 = −mg + Fd + Fs + F = −mg − cy0 + Fs + F.

Figure 6.1.3 (a) Natural length of spring (b) Spring stretched by mass
We must now relate Fs to y. In the absence of external forces the object stretches the spring by an amount
∆l to assume its equilibrium position (Figure 6.1.3). Since the sum of the forces acting on the object is
then zero, Hooke’s Law implies that mg = k∆l. If the object is displaced y units from its equilibrium
position, the total change in the length of the spring is ∆L = ∆l − y, so Hooke’s law implies that
Fs = k∆L = k∆l − ky.
Substituting this into (6.1.1) yields
my00 = −mg − cy0 + k∆L − ky + F.
Since mg = k∆l this can be written as
my00 + cy0 + ky = F.

(6.1.2)

We call this the equation of motion.
Simple Harmonic Motion
Throughout the rest of this section we’ll consider spring–mass systems without damping; that is, c = 0.
We’ll consider systems with damping in the next section.
We first consider the case where the motion is also free; that is, F =0. We begin with an example.
Example 6.1.1 An object stretches a spring 6 inches in equilibrium.
(a) Set up the equation of motion and find its general solution.
(b) Find the displacement of the object for t > 0 if it’s initially displaced 18 inches above equilibrium
and given a downward velocity of 3 ft/s.

270 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations
S OLUTION (a) Setting c = 0 and F = 0 in (6.1.2) yields the equation of motion
my00 + ky = 0,
which we rewrite as

k
y = 0.
(6.1.3)
m
Although we would need the weight of the object to obtain k from the equation mg = k∆l we can obtain
k/m from ∆l alone; thus, k/m = g/∆l. Consistent with the units used in the problem statement, we
take g = 32 ft/s2 . Although ∆l is stated in inches, we must convert it to feet to be consistent with this
choice of g; that is, ∆l = 1/2 ft. Therefore
y00 +

and (6.1.3) becomes
y00 + 64y = 0.

(6.1.4)

The characteristic equation of (6.1.4) is
r 2 + 64 = 0,
which has the zeros r = ±8i. Therefore the general solution of (6.1.4) is
y = c1 cos 8t + c2 sin 8t.

(6.1.5)

S OLUTION (b) The initial upward displacement of 18 inches is positive and must be expressed in feet.
The initial downward velocity is negative; thus,
y(0) =

and

y0 (0) = −3.

Differentiating (6.1.5) yields
y0 = −8c1 sin 8t + 8c2 cos 8t.

(6.1.6)

Setting t = 0 in (6.1.5) and (6.1.6) and imposing the initial conditions shows that c1 = 3/2 and c2 =
−3/8. Therefore

y = cos 8t − sin 8t,

where y is in feet (Figure 6.1.4).
We’ll now consider the equation
my00 + ky = 0

where m and k are arbitrary positive numbers. Dividing through by m and defining ω0 = k/m yields
y00 + ω02 y = 0.

The general solution of this equation is
y = c1 cos ω0 t + c2 sin ω0 t.
We can rewrite this in a more useful form by defining

Substituting from (6.1.9) into (6.1.7) and applying the identity

yields
y = R cos(ω0 t − φ).

(6.1.10)

From (6.1.8) and (6.1.9) we see that the R and φ can be interpreted as polar coordinates of the point
with rectangular coordinates (c1 , c2 ) (Figure 6.1.5). Given c1 and c2 , we can compute R from (6.1.8).
From (6.1.8) and (6.1.9), we see that φ is related to c1 and c2 by
cos φ = p

There are infinitely many angles φ, differing by integer multiples of 2π, that satisfy these equations. We
will always choose φ so that −π ≤ φ < π.
The motion described by (6.1.7) or (6.1.10) is simple harmonic motion. We see from either of these
equations that the motion is periodic, with period
T = 2π/ω0 .
This is the time required for the object to complete one full cycle of oscillation (for example, to move from
its highest position to its lowest position and back to its highest position). Since the highest and lowest
positions of the object are y = R and y = −R, we say that R is the amplitude of the oscillation. The

the motion. It is also called the natural frequency of the spring–mass system without damping.

Since sin φ < 0 (see (6.1.12)), the minus sign applies here; that is,
φ ≈ −.245 rad.
Example 6.1.3 The natural length of a spring is 1 m. An object is attached to it and the length of the
spring increases to 102 cm when the object is in equilibrium. Then the object is initially displaced
downward 1 cm and given an upward velocity of 14 cm/s. Find the displacement for t > 0. Also, find
the natural frequency, period, amplitude, and phase angle of the resulting motion. Express the answers in
cgs units.
Solution In cgs units g = 980 cm/s2 . Since ∆l = 2 cm, ω02 = g/∆l = 490. Therefore
y00 + 490y = 0,

y(0) = −1,

y0 (0) = 14.

Undamped Forced Oscillation
In many mechanical problems a device is subjected to periodic external forces. For example, soldiers
marching in cadence on a bridge cause periodic disturbances in the bridge, and the engines of a propeller
driven aircraft cause periodic disturbances in its wings. In the absence of sufficient damping forces, such
disturbances – even if small in magnitude – can cause structural breakdown if they are at certain critical
frequencies. To illustrate, this we’ll consider the motion of an object in a spring–mass system without
damping, subject to an external force
F (t) = F0 cos ωt

274 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations
where F0 is a constant. In this case the equation of motion (6.1.2) is
my00 + ky = F0 cos ωt,
which we rewrite as
y00 + ω02 y =

F0
cos ωt

with ω0 = k/m. We’ll see from the next two examples that the solutions of (6.1.13) with ω 6= ω0
behave very differently from the solutions with ω = ω0 .

Solution We first obtain a particular solution of (6.1.13) by the method of undetermined coefficients.
Since ω 6= ω0 , cos ωt isn’t a solution of the complementary equation
y00 + ω02 y = 0.
Therefore (6.1.13) has a particular solution of the form
yp = A cos ωt + B sin ωt.

(6.1.21)

From (6.1.20) we can regard y as a sinusoidal variation with frequency (ω0 + ω)/2 and variable amplitude |R(t)|. In Figure 6.1.6 the dashed curve above the t axis is y = |R(t)|, the dashed curve below the t
axis is y = −|R(t)|, and the displacement y appears as an oscillation bounded by them. The oscillation
of y for t on an interval between successive zeros of R(t) is called a beat.
You can see from (6.1.20) and (6.1.21) that
|y(t)| ≤

2|F0|
;
m|ω02 − ω2 |

moreover, if ω + ω0 is sufficiently large compared with ω − ω0 , then |y| assumes values close to (perhaps
equal to) this upper bound during each beat. However, the oscillation remains bounded for all t. (This
assumes that the spring can withstand deflections of this size and continue to obey Hooke’s law.) The
next example shows that this isn’t so if ω = ω0 .

Solution We first obtain a particular solution yp of (6.1.22). Since cos ω0 t is a solution of the complementary equation, the form for yp is
yp = t(A cos ω0 t + B sin ω0 t).

(6.1.23)

Then
yp0 = A cos ω0 t + B sin ω0 t + ω0 t(−A sin ω0 t + B cos ω0 t)
and
yp00 = 2ω0 (−A sin ω0 t + B cos ω0 t) − ω02 t(A cos ω0 t + B sin ω0 t).

with increasing amplitude that approaches ∞ as t → ∞. Of course, this means that the spring must
eventually fail to obey Hooke’s law or break.
This phenomenon of unbounded displacements of a spring–mass system in response to a periodic
forcing function at its natural frequency is called resonance. More complicated mechanical structures
can also exhibit resonance–like phenomena. For example, rhythmic oscillations of a suspension bridge
by wind forces or of an airplane wing by periodic vibrations of reciprocating engines can cause damage
or even failure if the frequencies of the disturbances are close to critical frequencies determined by the
parameters of the mechanical system in question.

6.2 SPRING PROBLEMS II
Free Vibrations With Damping
In this section we consider the motion of an object in a spring–mass system with damping. We start with
unforced motion, so the equation of motion is
my00 + cy0 + ky = 0.

(6.2.1)

Now suppose the object is displaced from equilibrium and given an initial velocity. Intuition suggests that
if the damping force is sufficiently weak the resulting motion will be oscillatory, as in the undamped case
considered in the previous section, while if it’s sufficiently strong the object may just move slowly toward
the equilibrium position without ever reaching it. We’ll now confirm these intuitive ideas mathematically.
The characteristic equation of (6.2.1) is
mr 2 + cr + k = 0.
The roots of this equation are
r1 =

(6.2.2)

In Section 5.2 we saw that the form of the solution of (6.2.1) depends upon whether c2 − 4mk is positive,
negative, or zero. We’ll now consider these three cases.
Underdamped Motion

√
We say the motion is underdamped if c < 4mk. In this case r1 and r2 in (6.2.2) are complex conjugates,
which we write as
c

r1 = −

The general solution of (6.2.1) in this case is
y = e−ct/2m(c1 cos ω1 t + c2 sin ω1 t).
By the method used in Section 6.1 to derive the amplitude–phase form of the displacement of an object
in simple harmonic motion, we can rewrite this equation as
y = Re−ct/2m cos(ω1 t − φ),

called the frequency, and T = 2π/ω1 (which is the period of the cosine function in (6.2.3) is called the
quasi–period. A typical graph of (6.2.3) is shown in Figure 6.2.1. As illustrated in that figure, the graph
of y oscillates between the dashed exponential curves y = ±Re−ct/2m.

Section 6.2 Spring Problems II

281

Overdamped Motion

√
We say the motion is overdamped if c > 4mk. In this case the zeros r1 and r2 of the characteristic
polynomial are real, with r1 < r2 < 0 (see (6.2.2)), and the general solution of (6.2.1) is
y = c1 er1 t + c2 er2 t .
Again limt→∞ y(t) = 0 as in the underdamped case, but the motion isn’t oscillatory, since y can’t equal
zero for more than one value of t unless c1 = c2 = 0. (Exercise 23.)
Critically Damped Motion

√
We say the motion is critically damped if c = 4mk. In this case r1 = r2 = −c/2m and the general
solution of (6.2.1) is
y = e−ct/2m (c1 + c2 t).
Again limt→∞ y(t) = 0 and the motion is nonoscillatory, since y can’t equal zero for more than one
value of t unless c1 = c2 = 0. (Exercise 22).
Example 6.2.1 Suppose a 64 lb weight stretches a spring 6 inches in equilibrium and a dashpot provides
a damping force of c lb for each ft/sec of velocity.
(a) Write the equation of motion of the object and determine the value of c for which the motion is
critically damped.
(b) Find the displacement y for t > 0 if the motion is critically damped and the initial conditions are
y(0) = 1 and y0 (0) = 20.
(c) Find the displacement y for t > 0 if the motion is critically damped and the initial conditions are
y(0) = 1 and y0 (0) = −20.
S OLUTION (a) Here m = 2 slugs and k = 64/.5 = 128 lb/ft. Therefore the equation of motion (6.2.1) is
2y00 + cy0 + 128y = 0.

(6.2.4)

The characteristic equation is
2r 2 + cr + 128 = 0,
which has roots
r=

−c ±

√

c2 − 8 · 128
.
4

Therefore the damping is critical if
c=

√

8 · 128 = 32 lb–sec/ft.

S OLUTION (b) Setting c = 32 in (6.2.4) and cancelling the common factor 2 yields
y00 + 16y + 64y = 0.
The characteristic equation is
r 2 + 16r + 64y = (r + 8)2 = 0.
Hence, the general solution is
y = e−8t (c1 + c2 t).

(6.2.6)

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y (0) = 20 in the last two equations shows that 1 = c1 and
20 = −8 + c2 . Hence, the solution of the initial value problem is
y = e−8t (1 + 28t).
Therefore the object approaches equilibrium from above as t → ∞. There’s no oscillation.
S OLUTION (c) Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y0 (0) = −20 in (6.2.5) and (6.2.6) yields
1 = c1 and −20 = −8 + c2 . Hence, the solution of this initial value problem is
y = e−8t (1 − 12t).
Therefore the object moves downward through equilibrium just once, and then approaches equilibrium
from below as t → ∞. Again, there’s no oscillation. The solutions of these two initial value problems
are graphed in Figure 6.2.2.
Example 6.2.2 Find the displacement of the object in Example 6.2.1 if the damping constant is c = 4
lb–sec/ft and the initial conditions are y(0) = 1.5 ft and y0 (0) = −3 ft/sec.
Solution With c = 4, the equation of motion (6.2.4) becomes
y00 + 2y0 + 64y = 0
after cancelling the common factor 2. The characteristic equation
r 2 + 2r + 64 = 0

Forced Vibrations With Damping
Now we consider the motion of an object in a spring-mass system with damping, under the influence of a
periodic forcing function F (t) = F0 cos ωt, so that the equation of motion is
my00 + cy0 + ky = F0 cos ωt.

(6.2.11)

In Section 6.1 we considered this equation with c = 0 and found that the resulting
displacement y assumed
p
arbitrarily large values in the case of resonance (that is, when ω = ω0 = k/m). Here we’ll see that in
the presence of damping the displacement remains bounded for all t, and the initial conditions have little
effect on the motion as t → ∞. In fact, we’ll see that for large t the displacement is closely approximated
by a function of the form
y = R cos(ωt − φ),
(6.2.12)
where the amplitude R depends upon m, c, k, F0 , and ω. We’re interested in the following question:

Section 6.2 Spring Problems II

285

Q UESTION :Assuming that m, c, k, and F0 are held constant, what value of ω produces the largest
amplitude R in (6.2.12), and what is this largest amplitude?
To answer this question, we must solve (6.2.11) and determine R in terms of F0 , ω0 , ω, and c. We can
obtain a particular solution of (6.2.11) by the method of undetermined coefficients. Since cos ωt does not
satisfy the complementary equation
my00 + cy0 + ky = 0,
we can obtain a particular solution of (6.2.11) in the form
yp = A cos ωt + B sin ωt.

(6.2.13)

Differentiating this yields
yp0 =

ω(−A sin ωt + B cos ωt)

and
yp00 = −ω2 (A cos ωt + B sin ωt).
From the last three equations,
myp00 + cyp0 + kyp = (−mω2 A + cωB + kA) cos ωt + (−mω2 B − cωA + kB) sin ωt,
so yp satisfies (6.2.11) if
(k − mω2 )A + cωB

Solving for A and B and substituting the results into (6.2.13) yields

In all three cases limt→∞ yc (t) = 0 for any choice of c1 and c2 . For this reason we say that yc is the
transient component of the solution y. The behavior of y for large t is determined by yp , which we call the
steady state component of y. Thus, for large t the motion is like simple harmonic motion at the frequency
of the external force.
The amplitude of yp in (6.2.17) is
F0
R= p
,
m2 (ω02 − ω2 )2 + c2 ω2

(6.2.18)

which is finite for all ω; that is, the presence of damping precludes the phenomenon of resonance that we
encountered in studying undamped vibrations under a periodic forcing function. We’ll now find the value
ωmax of ω for which R is maximized. This is the value of ω for which the function
ρ(ω) = m2 (ω02 − ω2 )2 + c2 ω2
in the denominator of (6.2.18) attains its minimum value. By rewriting this as
ρ(ω) = m2 (ω04 + ω4 ) + (c2 − 2m2 ω02 )ω2 ,

(6.2.19)

you can see that ρ is a strictly increasing function of ω2 if
q
√
c ≥ 2m2 ω02 = 2mk.

(Recall that ω02 = k/m). Therefore ωmax = 0 if this inequality holds. From (6.2.15), you can see that
φ = 0 if ω = 0. In this case, (6.2.14) reduces to

which is consistent with Hooke’s law: if the mass is subjected to a constant

ρ0 (ω) = 2ω(2m2 ω2 + c2 − 2m2 ω02 ),
and ωmax is the value of ω for which the expression in parentheses equals zero; that is,

6.3 THE RLC CIRCUIT
In this section we consider the RLC circuit, shown schematically in Figure 6.3.1. As we’ll see, the RLC
circuit is an electrical analog of a spring-mass system with damping.
Nothing happens while the switch is open (dashed line). When the switch is closed (solid line) we say
that the circuit is closed. Differences in electrical potential in a closed circuit cause current to flow in
the circuit. The battery or generator in Figure 6.3.1 creates a difference in electrical potential E = E(t)
between its two terminals, which we’ve marked arbitrarily as positive and negative. (We could just as
well interchange the markings.) We’ll say that E(t) > 0 if the potential at the positive terminal is greater
than the potential at the negative terminal, E(t) < 0 if the potential at the positive terminal is less than
the potential at the negative terminal, and E(t) = 0 if the potential is the same at the two terminals. We
call E the impressed voltage.

At any time t, the same current flows in all points of the circuit. We denote current by I = I(t). We
say that I(t) > 0 if the direction of flow is around the circuit from the positive terminal of the battery or
generator back to the negative terminal, as indicated by the arrows in Figure 6.3.1 I(t) < 0 if the flow is
in the opposite direction, and I(t) = 0 if no current flows at time t.

Section 6.3 The RLC Circuit

Differences in potential occur at the resistor, induction coil, and capacitor in Figure 6.3.1. Note that the
two sides of each of these components are also identified as positive and negative. The voltage drop across
each component is defined to be the potential on the positive side of the component minus the potential
on the negative side. This terminology is somewhat misleading, since “drop” suggests a decrease even
though changes in potential are signed quantities and therefore may be increases. Nevertheless, we’ll go
along with tradition and call them voltage drops. The voltage drop across the resistor in Figure 6.3.1 is
given by
VR = IR,
(6.3.1)
where I is current and R is a positive constant, the resistance of the resistor. The voltage drop across the
induction coil is given by

similarities in diverse physical phenomena. Since we’ve already studied the properties of solutions of
(6.3.7) in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, we can obtain results concerning solutions of (6.3.6) by simpling changing
notation, according to Table 6.3.8.

which has complex zeros r = −100 ± 200i. Therefore the general solution of (6.3.13) is
Q = e−100t(c1 cos 200t + c2 sin 200t).

(6.3.15)

Differentiating this and collecting like terms yields
Q0 = −e−100t [(100c1 − 200c2 ) cos 200t + (100c2 + 200c1 ) sin 200t] .

(6.3.16)

To find the solution of the initial value problem (6.3.14), we set t = 0 in (6.3.15) and (6.3.16) to obtain
c1 = Q(0) = 1 and

− 100c1 + 200c2 = Q0 (0) = 2;

therefore, c1 = 1 and c2 = 51/100, so


Q = e−100t cos 200t +

is the solution of (6.3.14). Differentiating this yields
I = e−100t(2 cos 200t − 251 sin 200t).
Forced Oscillations With Damping
An initial value problem for (6.3.6) has the form
LQ00 + RQ0 +

1
Q = E(t),
C

Q(0) = Q0 ,

Q0 (0) = I0 ,

(6.3.17)

where Q0 is the initial charge on the capacitor and I0 is the initial current in the circuit. We’ve already
seen that if E ≡ 0 then all solutions of (6.3.17) are transient. If E 6≡ 0, we know that the solution of
(6.3.17) has the form Q = Qc + Qp , where Qc satisfies the complementary equation, and approaches
zero exponentially as t → ∞ for any initial conditions , while Qp depends only on E and is independent
of the initial conditions. As in the case of forced oscillations of a spring-mass system with damping, we
call Qp the steady state charge on the capacitor of the RLC circuit. Since I = Q0 = Q0c + Q0p and Q0c
also tends to zero exponentially as t → ∞, we say that Ic = Q0c is the transient current and Ip = Q0p is
the steady state current. In most applications we’re interested only in the steady state charge and current.
Example 6.3.2 Find the amplitude-phase form of the steady state current in the RLC circuit in Figure 6.3.1 if the impressed voltage, provided by an alternating current generator, is E(t) = E0 cos ωt.

6.4 MOTION UNDER A CENTRAL FORCE
We’ll now study the motion of a object moving under the influence of a central force; that is, a force
whose magnitude at any point P other than the origin depends only on the distance from P to the origin,
and whose direction at P is parallel to the line connecting P and the origin, as indicated in Figure 6.4.1
for the case where the direction of the force at every point is toward the origin. Gravitational forces
are central forces; for example, as mentioned in Section 4.3, if we assume that Earth is a perfect sphere
with constant mass density then Newton’s law of gravitation asserts that the force exerted on an object
by Earth’s gravitational field is proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the
square of its distance from the center of Earth, which we take to be the origin.
If the initial position and velocity vectors of an object moving under a central force are parallel, then
the subsequent motion is along the line from the origin to the initial position. Here we’ll assume that the
initial position and velocity vectors are not parallel; in this case the subsequent motion is in the plane
determined by them. For convenience we take this to be the xy-plane. We’ll consider the problem of
determining the curve traversed by the object. We call this curve the orbit.
We can represent a central force in terms of polar coordinates
x = r cos θ,

y = r sin θ

as
F(r, θ) = f(r)(cos θ i + sin θ j).
We assume that f is continuous for all r > 0. The magnitude of F at (x, y) = (r cos θ, r sin θ) is |f(r)|,
so it depends only on the distance r from the point to the origin the direction of F is from the point to the
origin if f(r) < 0, or from the origin to the point if f(r) > 0. We’ll show that the orbit of an object with
mass m moving under this force is given by
r(θ) =

,
u(θ)

and h is a constant defined below.
Newton’s second law of motion (F = ma) says that the polar coordinates r = r(t) and θ = θ(t) of the
particle satisfy the vector differential equation
m(r cos θ i + r sin θ j)00 = f(r)(cos θ i + sin θ j).

(6.4.2)

To deal with this equation we introduce the unit vectors
e1 = cos θ i + sin θ j and

e2 = − sin θ i + cos θ j.

Note that e1 points in the direction of increasing r and e2 points in the direction of increasing θ (Figure 6.4.2); moreover,

e1 · e2 = cos θ(− sin θ) + sin θ cos θ = 0,
so e1 and e2 are perpendicular. Recalling that the single prime (0 ) stands for differentiation with respect
to t, we see from (6.4.3) and the chain rule that
e01 = θ0 e2

and

e02 = −θ0 e1 .

(from (6.4.4))

Substituting this into (6.4.5) yields


m r 00 − r(θ0 )2 e1 + m(rθ00 + 2r 0 θ0 )e2 = f(r)e1 .

By equating the coefficients of e1 and e2 on the two sides of this equation we see that

m r 00 − r(θ0 )2 = f(r)
and

rθ00 + 2r 0 θ0 = 0.
Multiplying the last equation by r yields
r 2 θ00 + 2rr 0 θ0 = (r 2 θ0 )0 = 0,

(6.4.6)

so
r 2 θ0 = h,

(6.4.7)

where h is a constant that we can write in terms of the initial conditions as
h = r 2 (0)θ0 (0).
Since the initial position and velocity vectors are
r 0 (0)e1 (0) + r(0)θ0 (0)e2 (0),

r(0)e1 (0) and

our assumption that these two vectors are not parallel implies that θ0 (0) 6= 0, so h 6= 0.

equal times; more precisely, if θ(t1 ) ≤ θ(t2 ) then the (signed) area of the sector

Series Solutions of Linear Second
Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we study a class of second order differential equations that occur in many applications, but can’t be solved in closed form in terms of elementary functions. Here are some examples:
(1) Bessel’s equation
x2 y00 + xy0 + (x2 − ν 2 )y = 0,
which occurs in problems displaying cylindrical symmetry, such as diffraction of light through a circular
aperture, propagation of electromagnetic radiation through a coaxial cable, and vibrations of a circular
drum head.
(2) Airy’s equation,
y00 − xy = 0,
which occurs in astronomy and quantum physics.
(3) Legendre’s equation
(1 − x2 )y00 − 2xy0 + α(α + 1)y = 0,
which occurs in problems displaying spherical symmetry, particularly in electromagnetism.
These equations and others considered in this chapter can be written in the form
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0,

(A)

where P0 , P1 , and P2 are polynomials with no common factor. For most equations that occur in applications, these polynomials are of degree two or less. We’ll impose this restriction, although the methods
that we’ll develop can be extended to the case where the coefficient functions are polynomials of arbitrary
degree, or even power series that converge in some circle around the origin in the complex plane.
Since (A) does not in general have closed form solutions, we seek series representations for solutions.
We’ll see that if P0 (0) 6= 0 then solutions of (A) can be written as power series

SECTION 7.1 reviews the properties of power series.
SECTIONS 7.2 AND 7.3 are devoted to finding power series solutions of (A) in the case where P0 (0) 6= 0.
The situation is more complicated if P0 (0) = 0; however, if P1 and P2 satisfy assumptions that apply to
most equations of interest, then we’re able to use a modified series method to obtain solutions of (A).
SECTION 7.4 introduces the appropriate assumptions on P1 and P2 in the case where P0 (0) = 0, and
deals with Euler’s equation
ax2 y00 + bxy0 + cy = 0,
where a, b, and c are constants. This is the simplest equation that satisfies these assumptions.

7.1 REVIEW OF POWER SERIES
Many applications give rise to differential equations with solutions that can’t be expressed in terms of
elementary functions such as polynomials, rational functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and
trigonometric functions. The solutions of some of the most important of these equations can be expressed
in terms of power series. We’ll study such equations in this chapter. In this section we review relevant
properties of power series. We’ll omit proofs, which can be found in any standard calculus text.
Definition 7.1.1 An infinite series of the form
∞
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n ,

(7.1.1)

where x0 and a0 , a1 , . . . , an , . . . are constants, is called a power series in x − x0 . We say that the power
series (7.1.1) converges for a given x if the limit
lim

N→∞

N
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n

exists; otherwise, we say that the power series diverges for the given x.
A power series in x − x0 must converge if x = x0 , since the positive powers of x − x0 are all zero
in this case. This may be the only value of x for which the power series converges. However, the next
theorem shows that if the power series converges for some x 6= x0 then the set of all values of x for which
it converges forms an interval.
Theorem 7.1.2 For any power series
∞
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n ,

exactly one of the these statements is true:
(i) The power series converges only for x = x0 .
(ii) The power series converges for all values of x.
(iii) There’s a positive number R such that the power series converges if |x − x0 | < R and diverges
if |x − x0 | > R.
In case (iii) we say that R is the radius of convergence of the power series. For convenience, we include
the other two cases in this definition
P∞by defining R = 0 in case (i) and R = ∞ in case (ii). We define the
open interval of convergence of n=0 an (x − x0 )n to be
(x0 − R, x0 + R)

if

0 < R < ∞,

or

(−∞, ∞)

if

R = ∞.

If R is finite, no general statement can be made concerning convergence at the endpoints x = x0 ± R of
the open interval of convergence; the series may converge
P∞ at one or both points, or diverge at both.
Recall from calculus
that
a
series
of
constants
if the series
n=0 αn is said to converge
P∞
Pabsolutely
∞
of absolute values n=0 |αn| converges. It can be shown that a power series n=0 an (x − x0 )n with
a positive radius of convergence R converges absolutely in its open interval of convergence; that is, the
series
∞
X
|an ||x − x0 |n
n=0

308 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Equations
of absolute values converges if |x − x0 | < R. However, if R < ∞, the series may fail to converge
absolutely at an endpoint x0 ± R, even if it converges there.
The next theorem provides a useful method for determining the radius of convergence of a power
series. It’s derived in calculus by applying the ratio test to the corresponding series of absolute values.
For related theorems see Exercises 2 and 4.
Theorem 7.1.3 Suppose there’s an integer N such that an 6= 0 if n ≥ N and
an+1
= L,
an
P∞
where 0 ≤ L ≤ ∞. Then the radius of convergence of n=0 an (x − x0 )n is R = 1/L, which should be
interpreted to mean that R = 0 if L = ∞, or R = ∞ if L = 0.

Differentiation of Power Series
A power series with a positive radius of convergence defines a function
f(x) =

∞
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n

on its open interval of convergence. We say that the series represents f on the open interval of convergence. A function f represented by a power series may be a familiar elementary function as in (7.1.2)–
(7.1.5); however, it often happens that f isn’t a familiar function, so the series actually defines f.
The next theorem shows that a function represented by a power series has derivatives of all orders on
the open interval of convergence of the power series, and provides power series representations of the
derivatives.
Theorem 7.1.4 A power series
f(x) =

Uniqueness of Power Series
The next theorem shows that if f is defined by a power series in x − x0 with a positive radius of convergence, then the power series is the Taylor series of f about x0 .
Theorem 7.1.5 If the power series
f(x) =

∞
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n

has a positive radius of convergence, then
an =
that is,

P∞

n=0 an (x

(7.1.9)

This result can be obtained by setting x = x0 in (7.1.8), which yields
f (k) (x0 ) = k(k − 1) · · · 1 · ak = k!ak .
This implies that
ak =

f (k) (x0 )
.
k!

Except for notation, this is the same as (7.1.9).
The next theorem lists two important properties of power series that follow from Theorem 7.1.5.
Theorem 7.1.6
(a) If
∞
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n =

∞
X

n=0

bn (x − x0 )n

for all x in an open interval that contains x0 , then an = bn for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
(b) If
∞
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n = 0

for all x in an open interval that contains x0 , then an = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Section 7.1 Review of Power Series

311

To obtain (a) we observe that the two series represent the same function f on the open interval; hence,
Theorem 7.1.5 implies that
an = b n =

f (n) (x0 )
,
n!

n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

(b) can be obtained from (a) by taking bn = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Taylor Polynomials
If f has N derivatives at a point x0 , we say that
TN (x) =

N
X
f (n) (x0 )
(x − x0 )n
n!
n=0

is the N -th Taylor polynomial of f about x0 . This definition and Theorem 7.1.5 imply that if
f(x) =

∞
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n ,

where the power series has a positive radius of convergence, then the Taylor polynomials of f about x0
are given by
N
X
TN (x) =
an (x − x0 )n .
n=0

In numerical applications, we use the Taylor polynomials to approximate f on subintervals of the open
interval of convergence of the power series. For example, (7.1.2) implies that the Taylor polynomial TN
of f(x) = ex is
N
X
xn
TN (x) =

n=0

The solid curve in Figure 7.1.1 is the graph of y = ex on the interval [0, 5]. The dotted curves in
Figure 7.1.1 are the graphs of the Taylor polynomials T1 , . . . , T6 of y = ex about x0 = 0. From this
figure, we conclude that the accuracy of the approximation of y = ex by its Taylor polynomial TN
improves as N increases.
Shifting the Summation Index
In Definition 7.1.1 of a power series in x − x0 , the n-th term is a constant multiple of (x − x0 )n . This
isn’t true in (7.1.6), (7.1.7), and (7.1.8), where the general terms are constant multiples of (x − x0 )n−1 ,
(x − x0 )n−2 , and (x − x0 )n−k , respectively. However, these series can all be rewritten so that their n-th
terms are constant multiples of (x − x0 )n . For example, letting n = k + 1 in the series in (7.1.6) yields
f 0 (x) =

∞
X

(k + 1)ak+1 (x − x0 )k ,

(7.1.10)

k=0

where we start the new summation index k from zero so that the first term in (7.1.10) (obtained by setting
k = 0) is the same as the first term in (7.1.6) (obtained by setting n = 1). However, the sum of a series is
independent of the symbol used to denote the summation index, just as the value of a definite integral is
independent of the symbol used to denote the variable of integration. Therefore we can replace k by n in
(7.1.10) to obtain

It isn’t really necessary to introduce the intermediate summation index k. We can obtain (7.1.11)
directly from (7.1.6) by replacing n by n + 1 in the general term of (7.1.6) and subtracting 1 from the
lower limit of (7.1.6). More generally, we use the following procedure for shifting indices.

Shifting the Summation Index in a Power Series

can be rewritten as

∞
X

bn (x − x0 )n−k

n=n0 −k

bn+k (x − x0 )n ;

that is, replacing n by n + k in the general term and subtracting k from the lower limit of summation
leaves the series unchanged.

Example 7.1.3 Rewrite the following power series from (7.1.7) and (7.1.8) so that the general term in

We can also write this as

where we added a zero term in the last series so that when we substitute from (7.1.15) and (7.1.16) into
(7.1.14) all three series will start with n = 0; thus,

Conversely, Theorem 7.1.6 (b) implies that if y = n=0 an xn satisfies (7.1.13) on I, then (7.1.18) holds.

316 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Equations
Solution Since we want a power series in x − 1, we rewrite the coefficient of y00 in (7.1.19) as 1 + x =

2y00 + (x − 1)y00 + 2(x − 1)2 y0 + 3y.

7.2 SERIES SOLUTIONS NEAR AN ORDINARY POINT I
Many physical applications give rise to second order homogeneous linear differential equations of the
form
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0,
(7.2.1)
where P0 , P1 , and P2 are polynomials. Usually the solutions of these equations can’t be expressed in
terms of familiar elementary functions. Therefore we’ll consider the problem of representing solutions of
(7.2.1) with series.
We assume throughout that P0 , P1 and P2 have no common factors. Then we say that x0 is an ordinary
point of (7.2.1) if P0 (x0 ) 6= 0, or a singular point if P0 (x0 ) = 0. For Legendre’s equation,
(1 − x2 )y00 − 2xy0 + α(α + 1)y = 0,

(7.2.2)

x0 = 1 and x0 = −1 are singular points and all other points are ordinary points. For Bessel’s equation,
x2 y00 + xy0 + (x2 − ν 2 )y = 0,
x0 = 0 is a singular point and all other points are ordinary points. If P0 is a nonzero constant as in Airy’s
equation,
y00 − xy = 0,
(7.2.3)
then every point is an ordinary point.
Since polynomials are continuous everywhere, P1 /P0 and P2 /P0 are continuous at any point x0 that
isn’t a zero of P0 . Therefore, if x0 is an ordinary point of (7.2.1) and a0 and a1 are arbitrary real numbers,
then the initial value problem
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0,

y(x0 ) = a0 ,

y0 (x0 ) = a1

(7.2.4)

has a unique solution on the largest open interval that contains x0 and does not contain any zeros of P0 .
To see this, we rewrite the differential equation in (7.2.4) as
y00 +

P1 (x) 0 P2 (x)
y +
y=0
P0 (x)
P0 (x)

and apply Theorem 5.1.1 with p = P1 /P0 and q = P2 /P0 . In this section and the next we consider the
problem of representing solutions of (7.2.1) by power series that converge for values of x near an ordinary
point x0 .
We state the next theorem without proof.

Theorem 7.2.1 Suppose P0 , P1 , and P2 are polynomials with no common factor and P0 isn’t identically
zero. Let x0 be a point such that P0 (x0 ) 6= 0, and let ρ be the distance from x0 to the nearest zero of P0
in the complex plane. (If P0 is constant, then ρ = ∞.) Then every solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0

(7.2.5)

can be represented by a power series
∞
X

y=

n=0

an (x − x0 )n

(7.2.6)

that converges at least on the open interval (x0 −ρ, x0 +ρ). ( If P0 is nonconstant, so that ρ is necessarily
finite, then the open interval of convergence of (7.2.6) may be larger than (x0 −ρ, x0 +ρ). If P0 is constant
then ρ = ∞ and (x0 − ρ, x0 + ρ) = (−∞, ∞).)
We call (7.2.6) a power series solution in x − x0 of (7.2.5). We’ll now develop a method for finding
power series solutions of (7.2.5). For this purpose we write (7.2.5) as Ly = 0, where
Ly = P0 y00 + P1 y0 + P2 y.

(7.2.7)

Theorem 7.2.1 implies that every solution of Ly = 0 on (x0 − ρ, x0 + ρ) can be written as
y=

Setting x = x0 in this series and in the series

nan (x − x0 )n−1

shows that y(x0 ) = a0 and y (x0 ) = a1 . Since every initial value problem (7.2.4) has a unique solution,
this means that a0 and a1 can be chosen arbitrarily, and a2 , a3 , . . . are uniquely determined by them.
To find a2 , a3 , . . . , we write P0 , P1 , and P2 in powers of x − x0 , substitute

Ly =

(7.2.8)

where {b0 , b1 , . . . , bn , . . . } are expressed in terms of {a0 , a1 , . . . , an , . . . } and the coefficients of P0 , P1 ,
and P2 , written in powers of x − x0 . Since (7.2.8) and (a) of Theorem 7.1.6 imply that Ly = 0 if and
only if bn = 0 for n ≥ 0, all power series solutions in x − x0 of Ly = 0 can be obtained by choosing
a0 and a1 arbitrarily and computing a2 , a3 , . . . , successively so that bn = 0 for n ≥ 0. For simplicity,
we call the power series obtained this way the power series in x − x0 for the general solution of Ly = 0,
without explicitly identifying the open interval of convergence of the series.

then (7.2.15) becomes

which should look familiar.
Equations like (7.2.10), (7.2.11), and (7.2.12), which define a given coefficient in the sequence {an }
in terms of one or more coefficients with lesser indices are called recurrence relations. When we use a
recurrence relation to compute terms of a sequence we’re computing recursively.
In the remainder of this section we consider the problem of finding power series solutions in x − x0
for equations of the form

1 + α(x − x0 )2 y00 + β(x − x0 )y0 + γy = 0.
(7.2.16)
Many important equations that arise in applications are of this form with x0 = 0, including Legendre’s
equation (7.2.2), Airy’s equation (7.2.3), Chebyshev’s equation,
(1 − x2 )y00 − xy0 + α2 y = 0,
and Hermite’s equation,
y00 − 2xy0 + 2αy = 0.
Since
P0 (x) = 1 + α(x − x0 )2
in (7.2.16), the point x0 is an ordinary point of (7.2.16), and Theorem 7.2.1 implies p
that the solutions
p of
(7.2.16) can be written as power series in x−x0 that converge on the interval (x0 −1/ |α|, x0 +1/ |α|)

324 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations
if α 6= 0, or on (−∞, ∞) if α = 0. We’ll see that the coefficients in these power series can be obtained
by methods similar to the one used in Example 7.2.1.
To simplify finding the coefficients, we introduce some notation for products:

Example 7.2.4 Compute a0 , a1 , . . . , a7 in the series solution y = n=0 an xn of the initial value problem
(1 + 2x2 )y00 + 10xy0 + 8y = 0, y(0) = 2, y0 (0) = −3.
(7.2.29)
Solution Since α = 2, β = 10, and γ = 8 in (7.2.29),
p(n) = 2n(n − 1) + 10n + 8 = 2(n + 2)2 .

USING TECHNOLOGY
Computing coefficients recursively as in Example 7.2.4 is tedious. We recommend that you do this
kind of computation by writing a short program to implement the appropriate recurrence relation on a
calculator or computer. You may wish to do this in verifying examples and doing exercises (identified by
the symbol C ) in this chapter that call for numerical computation of the coefficients in series solutions.
We obtained the answers to these exercises by using software that can produce answers in the form of
rational numbers. However, it’s perfectly acceptable - and more practical - to get your answers in decimal
form. You can always check them by converting our fractions to decimals.
If you’re interested in actually using series to compute numerical approximations to solutions of a
differential equation, then whether or not there’s a simple closed form for the coefficents is essentially
irrelevant. For computational purposes it’s usually more efficient to start with the given coefficients
a0 = y(x0 ) and a1 = y0 (x0 ), compute a2 , . . . , aN recursively, and then compute approximate values of
the solution from the Taylor polynomial
TN (x) =

N
X

n=0

an (x − x0 )n .

The trick is to decide how to choose N so the approximation y(x) ≈ TN (x) is sufficiently accurate on
the subinterval of the interval of convergence that you’re interested in. In the computational exercises
in this and the next two sections, you will often be asked to obtain the solution of a given problem by
numerical integration with software of your choice (see Section 10.1 for a brief discussion of one such
method), and to compare the solution obtained in this way with the approximations obtained with TN for
various values of N . This is a typical textbook kind of exercise, designed to give you insight into how
the accuracy of the approximation y(x) ≈ TN (x) behaves as a function of N and the interval that you’re
working on. In real life, you would choose one or the other of the two methods (numerical integration or
series solution). If you choose the method of series solution, then a practical procedure for determining
a suitable value of N is to continue increasing N until the maximum of |TN − TN−1 | on the interval of
interest is within the margin of error that you’re willing to accept.
In doing computational problems that call for numerical solution of differential equations you should
choose the most accurate numerical integration procedure your software supports, and experiment with
the step size until you’re confident that the numerical results are sufficiently accurate for the problem at
hand.


1 + α(x − x0 )2 y00 + β(x − x0 )y0 + γy = 0,

so Theorem 7.2.2 does not apply, and the computation of the coefficients {an } is more complicated. For
the equations considered here it’s difficult or impossible to obtain an explicit formula for an in terms of
n. Nevertheless, we can calculate as many coefficients as we wish. The next three examples illustrate
this.

343

7.4 REGULAR SINGULAR POINTS EULER EQUATIONS

This section sets the stage for Sections 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7. If you’re not interested in those sections, but wish
to learn about Euler equations, omit the introductory paragraphs and start reading at Definition 7.4.2.
In the next three sections we’ll continue to study equations of the form
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0

(7.4.1)

where P0 , P1 , and P2 are polynomials, but the emphasis will be different from that of Sections 7.2 and
7.3, where we obtained solutions of (7.4.1) near an ordinary point x0 in the form of power series in
x − x0 . If x0 is a singular point of (7.4.1) (that is, if P (x0 ) = 0), the solutions can’t in general be
represented by power series in x − x0. Nevertheless, it’s often necessary in physical applications to study
the behavior of solutions of (7.4.1) near a singular point. Although this can be difficult in the absence of
some sort of assumption on the nature of the singular point, equations that satisfy the requirements of the
next definition can be solved by series methods discussed in the next three sections. Fortunately, many
equations arising in applications satisfy these requirements.
Definition 7.4.1 Let P0 , P1 , and P2 be polynomials with no common factor and suppose P0 (x0 ) = 0.
Then x0 is a regular singular point of the equation
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = 0

(7.4.2)

(x − x0 )2 A(x)y00 + (x − x0 )B(x)y0 + C(x)y = 0

(7.4.3)

if (7.4.2) can be written as

where A, B, and C are polynomials and A(x0 ) 6= 0; otherwise, x0 is an irregular singular point of
(7.4.2).
Example 7.4.1 Bessel’s equation,
x2 y00 + xy0 + (x2 − ν 2 )y = 0,

(7.4.4)

has the singular point x0 = 0. Since this equation is of the form (7.4.3) with x0 = 0, A(x) = 1,
B(x) = 1, and C(x) = x2 − ν 2 , it follows that x0 = 0 is a regular singular point of (7.4.4).
Example 7.4.2 Legendre’s equation,
(1 − x2 )y00 − 2xy0 + α(α + 1)y = 0,

(7.4.5)

has the singular points x0 = ±1. Mutiplying through by 1 − x yields
(x − 1)2 (x + 1)y00 + 2x(x − 1)y0 − α(α + 1)(x − 1)y = 0,
which is of the form (7.4.3) with x0 = 1, A(x) = x + 1, B(x) = 2x, and C(x) = −α(α + 1)(x − 1).
Therefore x0 = 1 is a regular singular point of (7.4.5). We leave it to you to show that x0 = −1 is also a
regular singular point of (7.4.5).

344 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations
Example 7.4.3 The equation
x3 y00 + xy0 + y = 0
has an irregular singular point at x0 = 0. (Verify.)
For convenience we restrict our attention to the case where x0 = 0 is a regular singular point of (7.4.2).
This isn’t really a restriction, since if x0 6= 0 is a regular singular point of (7.4.2) then introducing the
new independent variable t = x − x0 and the new unknown Y (t) = y(t + x0 ) leads to a differential
equation with polynomial coefficients that has a regular singular point at t0 = 0. This is illustrated in
Exercise 22 for Legendre’s equation, and in Exercise 23 for the general case.
Euler Equations
The simplest kind of equation with a regular singular point at x0 = 0 is the Euler equation, defined as
follows.
Definition 7.4.2 An Euler equation is an equation that can be written in the form
ax2 y00 + bxy0 + cy = 0,

(7.4.6)

where a, b, and c are real constants and a 6= 0.
Theorem 5.1.1 implies that (7.4.6) has solutions defined on (0, ∞) and (−∞, 0), since (7.4.6) can be
rewritten as
b
c
ay00 + y0 + 2 y = 0.
x
x
For convenience we’ll restrict our attention to the interval (0, ∞). (Exercise 19 deals with solutions of
(7.4.6) on (−∞, 0).) The key to finding solutions on (0, ∞) is that if x > 0 then xr is defined as a
real-valued function on (0, ∞) for all values of r, and substituting y = xr into (7.4.6) produces
ax2 (xr )00 + bx(xr )0 + cxr

=
=

ax2 r(r − 1)xr−2 + bxrxr−1 + cxr
[ar(r − 1) + br + c]xr .

(7.4.7)

The polynomial
p(r) = ar(r − 1) + br + c

is called the indicial polynomial of (7.4.6), and p(r) = 0 is its indicial equation. From (7.4.7) we can see
that y = xr is a solution of (7.4.6) on (0, ∞) if and only if p(r) = 0. Therefore, if the indicial equation
has distinct real roots r1 and r2 then y1 = xr1 and y2 = xr2 form a fundamental set of solutions of (7.4.6)
on (0, ∞), since y2 /y1 = xr2 −r1 is nonconstant. In this case
y = c1 xr1 + c2 xr2

is the general solution of (7.4.6) on (0, ∞).
Example 7.4.4 Find the general solution of
x2 y00 − xy0 − 8y = 0

on (0, ∞).
Solution The indicial polynomial of (7.4.8) is

on (0, ∞).
Solution The indicial polynomial of (7.4.9) is
p(r) = 6r(r − 1) + 5r − 1 = (2r − 1)(3r + 1).
Therefore the general solution of (7.4.9) on (0, ∞) is
y = c1 x1/2 + c2 x−1/3 .
If the indicial equation has a repeated root r1 , then y1 = xr1 is a solution of
ax2 y00 + bxy0 + cy = 0,

(7.4.10)

on (0, ∞), but (7.4.10) has no other solution of the form y = xr . If the indicial equation has complex
conjugate zeros then (7.4.10) has no real–valued solutions of the form y = xr . Fortunately we can use
the results of Section 5.2 for constant coefficient equations to solve (7.4.10) in any case.
Theorem 7.4.3 Suppose the roots of the indicial equation
ar(r − 1) + br + c = 0

are r1 and r2 . Then the general solution of the Euler equation

(7.4.12) on (0, ∞) has the form stated in the theorem.

7.5 THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS I
In this section we begin to study series solutions of a homogeneous linear second order differential equation with a regular singular point at x0 = 0, so it can be written as
x2 A(x)y00 + xB(x)y0 + C(x)y = 0,
where A, B, C are polynomials and A(0) 6= 0.

(7.5.1)

Section 7.5 The Method of Frobenius I

349

We’ll see that (7.5.1) always has at least one solution of the form
y=x

r

∞
X

an x n

n=0

where a0 6= 0 and r is a suitably chosen number. The method we will use to find solutions of this form
and other forms that we’ll encounter in the next two sections is called the method of Frobenius, and we’ll
call them Frobenius solutions.
P∞
It can be shown that the power series n=0 an xn in a Frobenius solution of (7.5.1) converges on some
open interval (−ρ, ρ), where 0 < ρ ≤ ∞. However, since xr may be complex for negative x or undefined
if x = 0, we’ll consider solutions defined for positive values of x. Easy modifications of our results yield
solutions defined for negative values of x. (Exercise 54).
We’ll restrict our attention to the case where A, B, and C are polynomials of degree not greater than
two, so (7.5.1) becomes
x2 (α0 + α1 x + α2 x2 )y00 + x(β0 + β1 x + β2 x2 )y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x + γ2 x2 )y = 0,

(7.5.2)

where αi , βi , and γi are real constants and α0 6= 0. Most equations that arise in applications can be
written this way. Some examples are
αx2 y00 + βxy0 + γy

0,

2 00

and

2

(Laguerre’s equation),

where we would multiply the last equation through by x to put it in the form (7.5.2). However, the
method of Frobenius can be extended to the case where A, B, and C are functions that can be represented
by power series in x on some interval that contains zero, and A0 (0) 6= 0 (Exercises 57 and 58).
The next two theorems will enable us to develop systematic methods for finding Frobenius solutions
of (7.5.2).
Theorem 7.5.1 Let
Ly = x2 (α0 + α1 x + α2 x2 )y00 + x(β0 + β1 x + β2 x2 )y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x + γ2 x2 )y,

on the interval (0, ρ), where ρ is the distance from the origin to the nearest zero of A(x) = α0 + α1 x +
α2 x2 in the complex plane. (If A is constant, then ρ = ∞.)
If {an (r)} is determined by the recurrence relation (7.5.12) then substituting an = an (r) into (7.5.5)
yields b0 = p0 (r) and bn = 0 for n ≥ 1, so (7.5.4) reduces to (7.5.14). We omit the proof that the series
(7.5.13) converges on (0, ρ).
If αi = βi = γi = 0 for i = 1, 2, then Ly = 0 reduces to the Euler equation
α0 x2 y00 + β0 xy0 + γ0 y = 0.
Theorem 7.4.3 shows that the solutions of this equation are determined by the zeros of the indicial polynomial
p0 (r) = α0 r(r − 1) + β0 r + γ0 .
Since (7.5.14) implies that this is also true for the solutions of Ly = 0, we’ll also say that p0 is the indicial
polynomial of (7.5.2), and that p0 (r) = 0 is the indicial equation of Ly = 0. We’ll consider only cases
where the indicial equation has real roots r1 and r2 , with r1 ≥ r2 .
Theorem 7.5.3 Let L and {an (r)} be as in Theorem 7.5.2, and suppose the indicial equation p0 (r) = 0
of Ly = 0 has real roots r1 and r2 , where r1 ≥ r2 . Then

X

an (r2 )xn

n=0

is also a Frobenius solution of Ly = 0, and {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions.
Proof

Since r1 and r2 are roots of p0 (r) = 0, the indicial polynomial can be factored as
p0 (r) = α0 (r − r1 )(r − r2 ).

Therefore
p0 (n + r1 ) = nα0 (n + r1 − r2 ),

(7.5.15)

Section 7.5 The Method of Frobenius I

353

which is nonzero if n > 0, since r1 − r2 ≥ 0. Therefore the assumptions of Theorem 7.5.2 hold with
r = r1 , and (7.5.14) implies that Ly1 = p0 (r1 )xr1 = 0.
Now suppose r1 − r2 isn’t an integer. From (7.5.15),
p0 (n + r2 ) = nα0 (n − r1 + r2 ) 6= 0 if

n = 1, 2, · · · .

Hence, the assumptions of Theorem 7.5.2 hold with r = r2 , and (7.5.14) implies that Ly2 = p0 (r2 )xr2 =
0. We leave the proof that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions as an exercise (Exercise 52).
It isn’t always possible to obtain explicit formulas for the coefficients in Frobenius solutions. However,
we can always set up the recurrence relations and use them to compute as many coefficients as we want.
The next example illustrates this.
Example 7.5.1 Find a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of
2x2 (1 + x + x2 )y00 + x(9 + 11x + 11x2)y0 + (6 + 10x + 7x2 )y = 0.

(7.5.16)

Compute just the first six coefficients a0 ,. . . , a5 in each solution.
Solution For the given equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.5.2 are
p0 (r) =

p2 (r) =

2r(r − 1) + 9r + 6

2r(r − 1) + 11r + 7 =

(2r + 5)(r + 2),
(2r + 7)(r + 1).

The zeros of the indicial polynomial p0 are r1 = −3/2 and r2 = −2, so r1 − r2 = 1/2. Therefore

For n ≥ 2, the recurrence relation (7.5.12) of Theorem 7.5.2 involves the three coefficients an (r),
an−1 (r), and an−2 (r). We’ll now consider some special cases where (7.5.12) reduces to a two term
recurrence relation; that is, a relation involving only an (r) and an−1 (r) or only an (r) and an−2 (r).
This simplification often makes it possible to obtain explicit formulas for the coefficents of Frobenius
solutions.
We first consider equations of the form
x2 (α0 + α1 x)y00 + x(β0 + β1 x)y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x)y = 0
with α0 6= 0. For this equation, α2 = β2 = γ2 = 0, so p2 ≡ 0 and the recurrence relations in
Theorem 7.5.2 simplify to
a0 (r)

an (r) =

p1 (n + r − 1)
an−1 (r),
p0 (n + r)

R EMARK: Thus far, we considered only the case where the indicial equation has real roots that don’t
differ by an integer, which allows us to apply Theorem 7.5.3. However, for equations of the form (7.5.23),
the sequence {a2m (r)} in (7.5.24) is defined for r = r2 if r1 − r2 isn’t an even integer. It can be shown
(Exercise 56) that in this case

USING TECHNOLOGY
As we said at the end of Section 7.2, if you’re interested in actually using series to compute numerical
approximations to solutions of a differential equation, then whether or not there’s a simple closed form
for the coefficents is essentially irrelevant; recursive computation is usually more efficient. Since it’s also
laborious, we encourage you to write short programs to implement recurrence relations on a calculator or
computer, even in exercises where this is not specifically required.
In practical use of the method of Frobenius when x0 = 0 is a regular singular point, we’re interested
in how well the functions
N
X
yN (x, ri ) = xri
an (ri )xn , i = 1, 2,
n=0

approximate solutions to a given equation when ri is a zero of the indicial polynomial. In dealing with
the corresponding problem for the case where x0 = 0 is an ordinary point, we used numerical integration
to solve the differential equation subject to initial conditions y(0) = a0 , y0 (0) = a1 , and compared the
result with values of the Taylor polynomial
TN (x) =

N
X

an x n .

n=0

We can’t do that here, since in general we can’t prescribe arbitrary initial values for solutions of a differential equation at a singular point. Therefore, motivated by Theorem 7.5.2 (specifically, (7.5.14)), we
suggest the following procedure.

358 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations
Verification Procedure
Let L and Yn (x; ri ) be defined by
Ly = x2 (α0 + α1 x + α2 x2 )y00 + x(β0 + β1 x + β2 x2 )y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x + γ2 x2 )y
and
yN (x; ri ) = xri

N
X

an (ri )xn ,

n=0

where the coefficients

{an (ri )}N
n=0

are computed as in (7.5.12), Theorem 7.5.2. Compute the error
EN (x; ri ) = x−ri LyN (x; ri )/α0

(7.5.27)

for various values of N and various values of x in the interval (0, ρ), with ρ as defined in Theorem 7.5.2.
The multiplier x−ri /α0 on the right of (7.5.27) eliminates the effects of small or large values of xri
near x = 0, and of multiplication by an arbitrary constant. In some exercises you will be asked to
estimate the maximum value of EN (x; ri ) on an interval (0, δ] by computing EN (xm ; ri ) at the M points
xm = mδ/M, m = 1, 2, . . . , M , and finding the maximum of the absolute values:
σN (δ) = max{|EN (xm ; ri )|, m = 1, 2, . . . , M }.

(7.5.28)

(For simplicity, this notation ignores the dependence of the right side of the equation on i and M .)
To implement this procedure, you’ll have to write a computer program to calculate {an (ri )} from the
applicable recurrence relation, and to evaluate EN (x; ri ).
The next exercise set contains five exercises specifically identified by L that ask you to implement the
verification procedure. These particular exercises were chosen arbitrarily you can just as well formulate
such laboratory problems for any of the equations in any of the Exercises 1–10, 14-25, and 28–51

7.6 THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS II
In this section we discuss a method for finding two linearly independent Frobenius solutions of a homogeneous linear second order equation near a regular singular point in the case where the indicial equation
has a repeated real root. As in the preceding section, we consider equations that can be written as
x2 (α0 + α1 x + α2 x2 )y00 + x(β0 + β1 x + β2 x2 )y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x + γ2 x2 )y = 0

(7.6.1)

where α0 6= 0. We assume that the indicial equation p0 (r) = 0 has a repeated real root r1 . In this case
Theorem 7.5.3 implies that (7.6.1) has one solution of the form
y1 = xr1

∞

but does not provide a second solution y2 such that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions. The
following extension of Theorem 7.5.2 provides a way to find a second solution.
Theorem 7.6.1 Let
Ly = x2 (α0 + α1 x + α2 x2 )y00 + x(β0 + β1 x + β2 x2 )y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x + γ2 x2 )y,

(7.6.2)

where α0 6= 0 and define
p0 (r)

=

α0 r(r − 1) + β0 r + γ0 ,

p1 (r)

=

α1 r(r − 1) + β1 r + γ1 ,

p2 (r)

=

α2 r(r − 1) + β2 r + γ2 .

Suppose r is a real number such that p0 (n + r) is nonzero for all positive integers n, and define

which proves (7.6.5).
To prove that ∂y(x, r)/∂r satisfies (7.6.6), we view y in (7.6.2) as a function y = y(x, r) of two
variables, where the prime indicates partial differentiation with respect to x; thus,
y0 = y0 (x, r) =

∂y
(x, r) and
∂x

y00 = y00 (x, r) =

∂2y
(x, r).

With this notation we can use (7.6.2) to rewrite (7.6.4) as

where

q1 (x) =

form a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0.
Proof

Since r1 is a repeated root of p0 (r) = 0, the indicial polynomial can be factored as
p0 (r) = α0 (r − r1 )2 ,

so
p0 (n + r1 ) = α0 n2 ,
which is nonzero if n > 0. Therefore the assumptions of Theorem 7.6.1 hold with r = r1 , and (7.6.4)
implies that Ly1 = p0 (r1 )xr1 = 0. Since
p00 (r) = 2α(r − r1 )
it follows that p00 (r1 ) = 0, so (7.6.6) implies that
Ly2 = p00 (r1 )xr1 + xr1 p0 (r1 ) ln x = 0.
This proves that y1 and y2 are both solutions of Ly = 0. We leave the proof that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental
set as an exercise (Exercise 53).
Example 7.6.1 Find a fundamental set of solutions of
x2 (1 − 2x + x2 )y00 − x(3 + x)y0 + (4 + x)y = 0.

(7.6.9)

Compute just the terms involving xn+r1 , where 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 and r1 is the root of the indicial equation.

Since the recurrence formula (7.6.11) involves three terms, it’s not possible to obtain a simple explicit
formula for the coefficients in the Frobenius solutions of (7.6.9). However, as we saw in the preceding
sections, the recurrrence formula for {an (r)} involves only two terms if either α1 = β1 = γ1 = 0 or
α2 = β2 = γ2 = 0 in (7.6.1). In this case, it’s often possible to find explicit formulas for the coefficients.
The next two examples illustrate this.

If the solution y1 = y(x, r1 ) of Ly = 0 reduces to a finite sum, then there’s a difficulty in using
logarithmic differentiation to obtain the coefficients {a0n (r1 )} in the second solution. The next example
illustrates this difficulty and shows how to overcome it.

so a1 (3) = 1 and an (3) = 0 if n ≥ 2. Substituting these coefficients into (7.6.28) yields
y1 = x3 (1 + x).
To obtain y2 in (7.6.29) we must compute a0n (3) for n = 1, 2, . . . . Let’s first try logarithmic differentiation. From (7.6.30),

However, we can’t simply set r = 3 here if n ≥ 2, since the bracketed expression in the sum corresponding to j = 2 contains the term 1/(r − 3). In fact, since an (3) = 0 for n ≥ 2, the formula (7.6.31) for
a0n (r) is actually an indeterminate form at r = 3.
We overcome this difficulty as follows. From (7.6.30) with n = 1,

7.7 THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS III
In Sections 7.5 and 7.6 we discussed methods for finding Frobenius solutions of a homogeneous linear
second order equation near a regular singular point in the case where the indicial equation has a repeated
root or distinct real roots that don’t differ by an integer. In this section we consider the case where the
indicial equation has distinct real roots that differ by an integer. We’ll limit our discussion to equations
that can be written as
x2 (α0 + α1 x)y00 + x(β0 + β1 x)y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x)y = 0

(7.7.1)

or
x2 (α0 + α2 x2 )y00 + x(β0 + β2 x2 )y0 + (γ0 + γ2 x2 )y = 0,
where the roots of the indicial equation differ by a positive integer.
We begin with a theorem that provides a fundamental set of solutions of equations of the form (7.7.1).
Theorem 7.7.1 Let
Ly = x2 (α0 + α1 x)y00 + x(β0 + β1 x)y0 + (γ0 + γ1 x)y,
where α0 6= 0, and define
p0 (r)

α0 r(r − 1) + β0 r + γ0 ,

=

α1 r(r − 1) + β1 r + γ1 .

(7.7.9)

n=1

Since r1 and r2 are the roots of the indicial equation, the indicial polynomial can be written as


p0 (r) = α0 (r − r1 )(r − r2 ) = α0 r 2 − (r1 + r2 )r + r1 r2 .

Differentiating this yields

p00 (r) = α0 (2r − r1 − r2 ).

Therefore p00 (r1 ) = α0 (r1 − r2 ) = kα0 , so (7.7.9) implies (7.7.8).
Before proving (7.7.7), we first note an (r2 ) is well defined by (7.7.3) for 1 ≤ n ≤ k − 1, since
p0 (n + r2 ) 6= 0 for these values of n. However, we can’t define an (r2 ) for n ≥ k with (7.7.3), since
p0 (k + r2 ) = p0 (r1 ) = 0. For convenience, we define an (r2 ) = 0 for n ≥ k. Then, from Theorem 7.5.1,

If 1 ≤ n ≤ k − 1, then (7.7.3) implies that bn = 0. If n ≥ k + 1, then bn = 0 because an−1 (r2 ) =
an (r2 ) = 0. Therefore (7.7.10) reduces to

Since ak (r2 ) = 0 and k + r2 = r1 , this implies (7.7.7).
We leave the proof that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set as an exercise (Exercise 41).

We now consider equations of the form

where the roots of the indicial equation are real and differ by an even integer. The case where the roots
are real and differ by an odd integer can be handled by the method discussed in 56.
The proof of the next theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 7.7.1 (Exercise 43).

CHAPTER 8
Laplace Transforms

IN THIS CHAPTER we study the method of Laplace transforms, which illustrates one of the basic problem solving techniques in mathematics: transform a difficult problem into an easier one, solve the latter, and then use its solution to obtain a solution of the original problem. The method discussed here
transforms an initial value problem for a constant coefficient equation into an algebraic equation whose
solution can then be used to solve the initial value problem. In some cases this method is merely an
alternative procedure for solving problems that can be solved equally well by methods that we considered
previously; however, in other cases the method of Laplace transforms is more efficient than the methods
previously discussed. This is especially true in physical problems dealing with discontinuous forcing
functions.
SECTION 8.1 defines the Laplace transform and developes its properties.
SECTION 8.2 deals with the problem of finding a function that has a given Laplace transform.
SECTION 8.3 applies the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems for constant coefficient second
order differential equations on (0, ∞).

SECTION 8.4 introduces the unit step function.

SECTION 8.5 uses the unit step function to solve constant coefficient equations with piecewise continuous forcing functions.
SECTION 8.6 deals with the convolution theorem, an important theoretical property of the Laplace transform.
SECTION 8.7 introduces the idea of impulsive force, and treats constant coefficient equations with impulsive forcing functions.
SECTION 8.8 is a brief table of Laplace transforms.

8.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
Definition of the Laplace Transform
To define the Laplace transform, we first recall the definition of an improper integral. If g is integrable
over the interval [a, T ] for every T > a, then the improper integral of g over [a, ∞) is defined as
Z

∞

g(t) dt = lim

T →∞

T

Z

g(t) dt.

(8.1.1)

a

We say that the improper integral converges if the limit in (8.1.1) exists; otherwise, we say that the
improper integral diverges or does not exist. Here’s the definition of the Laplace transform of a function
f.
Definition 8.1.1 Let f be defined for t ≥ 0 and let s be a real number. Then the Laplace transform of f
is the function F defined by
Z
∞

e−st f(t) dt,

F (s) =

(8.1.2)

0

for those values of s for which the improper integral converges.

It is important to keep in mind that the variable of integration in (8.1.2) is t, while s is a parameter
independent of t. We use t as the independent variable for f because in applications the Laplace transform
is usually applied to functions of time.
The Laplace transform can be viewed as an operator L that transforms the function f = f(t) into the
function F = F (s). Thus, (8.1.2) can be expressed as
F = L(f).
The functions f and F form a transform pair, which we’ll sometimes denote by
f(t) ↔ F (s).
It can be shown that if F (s) is defined for s = s0 then it’s defined for all s > s0 (Exercise 14(b)).
Computation of Some Simple Laplace Transforms

Tables of Laplace transforms
Extensive tables of Laplace transforms have been compiled and are commonly used in applications. The
brief table of Laplace transforms in the Appendix will be adequate for our purposes.

Solution The table includes the transform pair

We’ll sometimes write Laplace transforms of specific functions without explicitly stating how they are
obtained. In such cases you should refer to the table of Laplace transforms.
Linearity of the Laplace Transform
The next theorem presents an important property of the Laplace transform.
Theorem 8.1.2 [Linearity Property] Suppose L(fi ) is defined for s > si , 1 ≤ i ≤ n). Let s0 be the
largest of the numbers s1 , s2 , . . . ,sn , and let c1 , c2 ,. . . , cn be constants. Then
L(c1 f1 + c2 f2 + · · · + cn fn ) = c1 L(f1 ) + c2 L(f2 ) + · · · + cn L(fn ) for s > s0 .
Proof

We give the proof for the case where n = 2. If s > s0 then

The First Shifting Theorem

this kind, see Exercises 6 and 13.)

Existence of Laplace Transforms
Not every function has a Laplace transform. For example, it can be shown (Exercise 3) that
Z ∞
2
e−st et dt = ∞
0

2

for every real number s. Hence, the function f(t) = et does not have a Laplace transform.
Our next objective is to establish conditions that ensure the existence of the Laplace transform of a
function. We first review some relevant definitions from calculus.
Recall that a limit
lim f(t)
t→t0

exists if and only if the one-sided limits
lim f(t)

t→t0 −

and

lim f(t)

t→t0+

both exist and are equal; in this case,
lim f(t) = lim f(t) = lim f(t).

t→t0

t→t0 −

t→t0+

Recall also that f is continuous at a point t0 in an open interval (a, b) if and only if
lim f(t) = f(t0 ),

t→t0

which is equivalent to
lim f(t) = lim f(t) = f(t0 ).

t→t0 +

t→t0−

(8.1.12)

For simplicity, we define
f(t0 +) = lim f(t)
t→t0+

and

f(t0 −) = lim f(t),
t→t0 −

so (8.1.12) can be expressed as
f(t0 +) = f(t0 −) = f(t0 ).
If f(t0 +) and f(t0 −) have finite but distinct values, we say that f has a jump discontinuity at t0 , and
f(t0 +) − f(t0 −)
is called the jump in f at t0 (Figure 8.1.1).

Figure 8.1.1 A jump discontinuity

If f(t0 +) and f(t0 −) are finite and equal, but either f isn’t defined at t0 or it’s defined but
f(t0 ) 6= f(t0 +) = f(t0 −),
we say that f has a removable discontinuity at t0 (Figure 8.1.2). This terminolgy is appropriate since a
function f with a removable discontinuity at t0 can be made continuous at t0 by defining (or redefining)
f(t0 ) = f(t0 +) = f(t0 −).
R EMARK: We know from calculus that a definite integral isn’t affected by changing the values of its
integrand at isolated points. Therefore, redefining a function f to make it continuous at removable discontinuities does not change L(f).
Definition 8.1.4
(i) A function f is said to be piecewise continuous on a finite closed interval [0, T ] if f(0+) and
f(T −) are finite and f is continuous on the open interval (0, T ) except possibly at finitely many
points, where f may have jump discontinuities or removable discontinuities.
(ii) A function f is said to be piecewise continuous on the infinite interval [0, ∞) if it’s piecewise
continuous on [0, T ] for every T > 0.
Figure 8.1.3 shows the graph of a typical piecewise continuous function.
It is shown in calculus that if a function is piecewise continuous on a finite closed interval then it’s
integrable on that interval. But if f is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞), then so is e−st f(t), and therefore

s if f(t) = et . Stated informally, this occurs because et increases too rapidly as t → ∞. The next
definition provides a constraint on the growth of a function that guarantees convergence of its Laplace
transform for s in some interval (s0 , ∞) .
Definition 8.1.5 A function f is said to be of exponential order s0 if there are constants M and t0 such
that
|f(t)| ≤ M es0 t , t ≥ t0 .

In situations where the specific value of s0 is irrelevant we say simply that f is of exponential order.
The next theorem gives useful sufficient conditions for a function f to have a Laplace transform. The
proof is sketched in Exercise 10.
Theorem 8.1.6 If f is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞) and of exponential order s0 , then L(f) is defined
for s > s0 .
R EMARK: We emphasize that the conditions of Theorem 8.1.6 are sufficient, but not necessary, for f to
have a Laplace transform. For example, Exercise 14(c) shows that f may have a Laplace transform even
though f isn’t of exponential order.
Example 8.1.8 If f is bounded on some interval [t0 , ∞), say
|f(t)| ≤ M,

t ≥ t0 ,

then (8.1.14) holds with s0 = 0, so f is of exponential order zero. Thus, for example, sin ωt and cos ωt
are of exponential order zero, and Theorem 8.1.6 implies that L(sin ωt) and L(cos ωt) exist for s > 0.
This is consistent with the conclusion of Example 8.1.4.

402 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms
Example 8.1.9 It can be shown that if limt→∞ e−s0 t f(t) exists and is finite then f is of exponential
order s0 (Exercise 9). If α is any real number and s0 > 0 then f(t) = tα is of exponential order s0 , since
lim e−s0 t tα = 0,

t→∞

by L’Hôpital’s rule. If α ≥ 0, f is also continuous on [0, ∞). Therefore Exercise 9 and Theorem 8.1.6
imply that L(tα ) exists for s ≥ s0 . However, since s0 is an arbitrary positive number, this really implies
that L(tα ) exists for all s > 0. This is consistent with the results of Example 8.1.2 and Exercises 6 and 8.

We’ll also say that f is an inverse Laplace Transform of F , and write
f = L−1 (F ).

406 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms
To solve differential equations with the Laplace transform, we must be able to obtain f from its transform
F . There’s a formula for doing this, but we can’t use it because it requires the theory of functions of a
complex variable. Fortunately, we can use the table of Laplace transforms to find inverse transforms that
we’ll need.

R EMARK: We’ll often write inverse Laplace transforms of specific functions without explicitly stating
how they are obtained. In such cases you should refer to the table of Laplace transforms in Section 8.8.
Inverse Laplace Transforms of Rational Functions
Using the Laplace transform to solve differential equations often requires finding the inverse transform
of a rational function
P (s)
F (s) =
,
Q(s)
where P and Q are polynomials in s with no common factors. Since it can be shown that lims→∞ F (s) =
0 if F is a Laplace transform, we need only consider the case where degree(P ) < degree(Q). To obtain
L−1 (F ), we find the partial fraction expansion of F , obtain inverse transforms of the individual terms in
the expansion from the table of Laplace transforms, and use the linearity property of the inverse transform.
The next two examples illustrate this.

Solution (M ETHOD 2) We don’t really have to multiply (8.2.3) by (s − 1)(s − 2) to compute A and

and setting s = 2 leads to (8.2.5). (It isn’t necesary to write the last two equations. We wrote them only
to justify the shortcut procedure indicated in (8.2.4) and (8.2.5).)
The shortcut employed in the second solution of Example 8.2.4 is Heaviside’s method. The next theorem states this method formally. For a proof and an extension of this theorem, see Exercise 10.
Theorem 8.2.2 Suppose

(8.2.10)

Because of the repeated factor (s + 2)2 in (8.2.9), Heaviside’s method doesn’t work. Instead, we find a
common denominator in (8.2.10). This yields
F (s) =

A(s + 2)2 + B(s + 1)(s + 2) + C(s + 1)
.
(s + 1)(s + 2)2

(8.2.11)

If (8.2.9) and (8.2.11) are to be equivalent, then
A(s + 2)2 + B(s + 1)(s + 2) + C(s + 1) = 8 − (s + 2)(4s + 10).

(8.2.12)

410 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms
The two sides of this equation are polynomials of degree two. From a theorem of algebra, they will be
equal for all s if they are equal for any three distinct values of s. We may determine A, B and C by
choosing convenient values of s.
The left side of (8.2.12) suggests that we take s = −2 to obtain C = −8, and s = −1 to obtain A = 2.
We can now choose any third value of s to determine B. Taking s = 0 yields 4A + 2B + C = −12.
Since A = 2 and C = −8 this implies that B = −6. Therefore

recommend that you use such a package if one is available to you, but only after you’ve done enough

8.3 SOLUTION OF INITIAL VALUE PROBLEMS
Laplace Transforms of Derivatives
In the rest of this chapter we’ll use the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems for constant
coefficient second order equations. To do this, we must know how the Laplace transform of f 0 is related
to the Laplace transform of f. The next theorem answers this question.
Theorem 8.3.1 Suppose f is continuous on [0, ∞) and of exponential order s0 , and f 0 is piecewise
continuous on [0, ∞). Then f and f 0 have Laplace transforms for s > s0 , and
L(f 0 ) = sL(f) − f(0).

(8.3.1)

Proof
We know from Theorem 8.1.6 that L(f) is defined for s > s0 . We first consider the case where f 0 is
continuous on [0, ∞). Integration by parts yields

for any T > 0. Since f is of exponential order s0 , limT →∞ e
f(T ) = 0 and the last integral in (8.3.2)
converges as T → ∞ if s > s0 . Therefore

which proves (8.3.1). Now suppose T > 0 and f 0 is only piecewise continuous on [0, T ], with discontinuities at t1 < t2 < · · · < tn−1 . For convenience, let t0 = 0 and tn = T . Integrating by parts
yields

= e−stN f(tN ) − e−st0 f(t0 ) = e−sT f(T ) − f(0)

yields (8.3.2), so (8.3.1) follows as before.
Example 8.3.1 In Example 8.1.4 we saw that
L(cos ωt) =

In Section 2.1 we showed that the solution of the initial value problem
y0 = ay,

y(0) = y0 ,

(8.3.3)

is y = y0 eat . We’ll now obtain this result by using the Laplace transform.
Let Y (s) = L(y) be the Laplace transform of the unknown solution of (8.3.3). Taking Laplace transforms of both sides of (8.3.3) yields
L(y0 ) = L(ay),
which, by Theorem 8.3.1, can be rewritten as

sL(y) − y(0) = aL(y),
or
Solving for Y (s) yields

sY (s) − y0 = aY (s).

We need the next theorem to solve second order differential equations using the Laplace transform.

416 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms
Theorem 8.3.2 Suppose f and f 0 are continuous on [0, ∞) and of exponential order s0 , and that f 00 is
piecewise continuous on [0, ∞). Then f, f 0 , and f 00 have Laplace transforms for s > s0 ,
L(f 0 ) = sL(f) − f(0),

(8.3.4)

L(f 00 ) = s2 L(f) − f 0 (0) − sf(0).

(8.3.5)

and
Proof Theorem 8.3.1 implies that L(f 0 ) exists and satisfies (8.3.4) for s > s0 . To prove that L(f 00 )
exists and satisfies (8.3.5) for s > s0 , we first apply Theorem 8.3.1 to g = f 0 . Since g satisfies the
hypotheses of Theorem 8.3.1, we conclude that L(g0 ) is defined and satisfies
L(g0 ) = sL(g) − g(0)
for s > s0 . However, since g0 = f 00 , this can be rewritten as
L(f 00 ) = sL(f 0 ) − f 0 (0).
Substituting (8.3.4) into this yields (8.3.5).
Solving Second Order Equations with the Laplace Transform
We’ll now use the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems for second order equations.
Example 8.3.2 Use the Laplace transform to solve the initial value problem
y00 − 6y0 + 5y = 3e2t ,

y0 (0) = 3.

y(0) = 2,

(8.3.6)

Solution Taking Laplace transforms of both sides of the differential equation in (8.3.6) yields

which we rewrite as

L(y00 − 6y0 + 5y) = L 3e2t =
L(y00 ) − 6L(y0 ) + 5L(y) =

s−2

(8.3.7)

Now denote L(y) = Y (s). Theorem 8.3.2 and the initial conditions in (8.3.6) imply that
L(y0 ) = sY (s) − y(0) = sY (s) − 2
and
L(y00 ) = s2 Y (s) − y0 (0) − sy(0) = s2 Y (s) − 3 − 2s.
Substituting from the last two equations into (8.3.7) yields

Therefore


s2 Y (s) − 3 − 2s − 6 (sY (s) − 2) + 5Y (s) =
(s2 − 6s + 5)Y (s) =

so

and taking the inverse transform of this yields

as the solution of (8.3.6).
It isn’t necessary to write all the steps that we used to obtain (8.3.8). To see how to avoid this, let’s
apply the method of Example 8.3.2 to the general initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t),

y(0) = k0 ,

y0 (0) = k1 .

(8.3.9)

Taking Laplace transforms of both sides of the differential equation in (8.3.9) yields
aL(y00 ) + bL(y0 ) + cL(y) = F (s).

(8.3.10)

Now let Y (s) = L(y). Theorem 8.3.2 and the initial conditions in (8.3.9) imply that
L(y0 ) = sY (s) − k0

and

L(y00 ) = s2 Y (s) − k1 − k0 s.

Substituting these into (8.3.10) yields

a s2 Y (s) − k1 − k0 s + b (sY (s) − k0 ) + cY (s) = F (s).

(8.3.11)

The coefficient of Y (s) on the left is the characteristic polynomial
p(s) = as2 + bs + c

of the complementary equation for (8.3.9). Using this and moving the terms involving k0 and k1 to the
right side of (8.3.11) yields
p(s)Y (s) = F (s) + a(k1 + k0 s) + bk0 .

(8.3.12)

This equation corresponds to (8.3.8) of Example 8.3.2. Having established the form of this equation in
the general case, it is preferable to go directly from the initial value problem to this equation. You may
find it easier to remember (8.3.12) rewritten as
p(s)Y (s) = F (s) + a (y0 (0) + sy(0)) + by(0).

(8.3.13)

Example 8.3.3 Use the Laplace transform to solve the initial value problem
2y00 + 3y0 + y = 8e−2t ,

y(0) = −4, y0 (0) = 2.

Solution The characteristic polynomial is
p(s) = 2s2 + 3s + 1 = (2s + 1)(s + 1)

(8.3.14)

418 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

R EMARK: In our examples we applied Theorems 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 without verifying that the unknown
function y satisfies their hypotheses. This is characteristic of the formal manipulative way in which the
Laplace transform is used to solve differential equations. Any doubts about the validity of the method for
solving a given equation can be resolved by verifying that the resulting function y is the solution of the
given problem.

where a, b, and c are constants and f is piecewise continuous. In this section we’ll develop procedures
for using the table of Laplace transforms to find Laplace transforms of piecewise continuous functions,
and to find the piecewise continuous inverses of Laplace transforms.

Laplace Transforms of Piecewise Continuous Functions
We’ll now develop the method of Example 8.4.1 into a systematic way to find the Laplace transform of a
piecewise continuous function. It is convenient to introduce the unit step function, defined as

0, t < 0
u(t) =
(8.4.4)
1, t ≥ 0.
Thus, u(t) “steps” from the constant value 0 to the constant value 1 at t = 0. If we replace t by t − τ in
(8.4.4), then

0, t < τ,
u(t − τ ) =
;
1, t ≥ τ
that is, the step now occurs at t = τ (Figure 8.4.2).
The step function enables us to represent piecewise continuous functions conveniently. For example,
consider the function
(
f0 (t), 0 ≤ t < t1 ,
f(t) =
(8.4.5)
f1 (t), t ≥ t1 ,
where we assume that f0 and f1 are defined on [0, ∞), even though they equal f only on the indicated
intervals. This assumption enables us to rewrite (8.4.5) as
f(t) = f0 (t) + u(t − t1 ) (f1 (t) − f0 (t)) .
To verify this, note that if t < t1 then u(t − t1 ) = 0 and (8.4.6) becomes
f(t) = f0 (t) + (0) (f1 (t) − f0 (t)) = f0 (t).
If t ≥ t1 then u(t − t1 ) = 1 and (8.4.6) becomes
f(t) = f0 (t) + (1) (f1 (t) − f0 (t)) = f1 (t).
We need the next theorem to show how (8.4.6) can be used to find L(f).

(8.4.6)

Section 8.4 The Unit Step Function

423

Theorem 8.4.1 Let g be defined on [0, ∞). Suppose τ ≥ 0 and L (g(t + τ )) exists for s > s0 . Then
L (u(t − τ )g(t)) exists for s > s0 , and
L(u(t − τ )g(t)) = e−sτ L (g(t + τ )) .
Proof

By definition,
L (u(t − τ )g(t)) =

Z

e−st u(t − τ )g(t) dt.

From this and the definition of u(t − τ ),
L (u(t − τ )g(t)) =

Changing the name of the variable of integration in the last integral from x to t yields

e−st g(t + τ ) dt = e−sτ L(g(t + τ )).

Example 8.4.2 Find

L u(t − 1)(t2 + 1) .
Solution Here τ = 1 and g(t) = t2 + 1, so
g(t + 1) = (t + 1)2 + 1 = t2 + 2t + 2.

1 + u(t − 2)(−2t + 1 − 1) + u(t − 3)(3t + 2t − 1)

or
f(t) = 1 − 2u(t − 2)t + u(t − 3)(5t − 1) − u(t − 5)(2t + 1).

The Second Shifting Theorem
Replacing g(t) by g(t − τ ) in Theorem 8.4.1 yields the next theorem.
Theorem 8.4.2 [Second Shifting Theorem] If τ ≥ 0 and L(g) exists for s > s0 then L (u(t − τ )g(t − τ ))
exists for s > s0 and
L(u(t − τ )g(t − τ )) = e−sτ L(g(t)),
or, equivalently,
if g(t) ↔ G(s), then u(t − τ )g(t − τ ) ↔ e−sτ G(s).

(8.4.12)

R EMARK: Recall that the First Shifting Theorem (Theorem 8.1.3 states that multiplying a function by eat
corresponds to shifting the argument of its transform by a units. Theorem 8.4.2 states that multiplying a
Laplace transform by the exponential e−τs corresponds to shifting the argument of the inverse transform
by τ units.

8.5 CONSTANT COEEFFICIENT EQUATIONS WITH PIECEWISE CONTINUOUS FORCING FUNCTIONS

We’ll now consider initial value problems of the form
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t),

y(0) = k0 ,

y0 (0) = k1 ,

(8.5.1)

where a, b, and c are constants (a 6= 0) and f is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞). Problems of this kind
occur in situations where the input to a physical system undergoes instantaneous changes, as when a
switch is turned on or off or the forces acting on the system change abruptly.
It can be shown (Exercises 23 and 24) that the differential equation in (8.5.1) has no solutions on an
open interval that contains a jump discontinuity of f. Therefore we must define what we mean by a
solution of (8.5.1) on [0, ∞) in the case where f has jump discontinuities. The next theorem motivates
our definition. We omit the proof.

432 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms
Theorem 8.5.1 Suppose a, b, and c are constants (a 6= 0), and f is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞). with
jump discontinuities at t1 , . . . , tn , where
0 < t1 < · · · < tn .
Let k0 and k1 be arbitrary real numbers. Then there is a unique function y defined on [0, ∞) with these
properties:
(a) y(0) = k0 and y0 (0) = k1 .
(b) y and y0 are continuous on [0, ∞).

(c) y00 is defined on every open subinterval of [0, ∞) that does not contain any of the points t1 , . . . , tn ,
and
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t)
on every such subinterval.

(d) y00 has limits from the right and left at t1 , . . . , tn .
We define the function y of Theorem 8.5.1 to be the solution of the initial value problem (8.5.1).
We begin by considering initial value problems of the form
(
f0 (t), 0 ≤ t < t1 ,
ay00 + by0 + cy =
y(0) = k0 , y0 (0) = k1 ,
(8.5.2)
f1 (t), t ≥ t1 ,
where the forcing function has a single jump discontinuity at t1 .
We can solve (8.5.2) by the these steps:
Step 1. Find the solution y0 of the initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = f0 (t),

y(0) = k0 ,

y0 (0) = k1 .

Step 2. Compute c0 = y0 (t1 ) and c1 = y00 (t1 ).
Step 3. Find the solution y1 of the initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = f1 (t),

y(t1 ) = c0 ,

y0 (t1 ) = c1 .

Step 4. Obtain the solution y of (8.5.2) as
y=

(

y0 (t),
y1 (t),

0 ≤ t < t1
t ≥ t1 .

It is shown in Exercise 23 that y0 exists and is continuous at t1 . The next example illustrates this
procedure.

y(0) = k0 ,

y0 (0) = k1 ,

and apply the method of Laplace transforms. We’ll now solve the problem considered in Example 8.5.1
by this method.

(A + B)s2 + Cs + A = 1.
Equating coefficients of like powers of s on the two sides of this equation shows that A = 1, B = −A =

yields a function y with the properties stated in Theorem 8.5.1; that is, such that y and y0 are continuous
on [0, ∞) and y00 has limits from the right and left at t1 . However, this is true if f0 and f1 are continuous
and of exponential order on [0, ∞). A proof is sketched in Exercises 8.6.11–8.6.13.

In this section we consider the problem of finding the inverse Laplace transform of a product H(s) =
F (s)G(s), where F and G are the Laplace transforms of known functions f and g. To motivate our
interest in this problem, consider the initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t),

y(0) = 0,

y0 (0) = 0.

Taking Laplace transforms yields
(as2 + bs + c)Y (s) = F (s),
so
Y (s) = F (s)G(s),

Until now wen’t been interested in the factorization indicated in (8.6.1), since we dealt only with differential equations with specific forcing functions. Hence, we could simply do the indicated multiplication
in (8.6.1) and use the table of Laplace transforms to find y = L−1 (Y ). However, this isn’t possible if we
want a formula for y in terms of f, which may be unspecified.
To motivate the formula for L−1 (F G), consider the initial value problem
G(s) =

y0 − ay = f(t),

y(0) = 0,

(8.6.2)

which we first solve without using the Laplace transform. The solution of the differential equation in
(8.6.2) is of the form y = ueat where
u0 = e−at f(t).
Integrating this from 0 to t and imposing the initial condition u(0) = y(0) = 0 yields

Evaluating Convolution Integrals

theorem provides a convenient way to evaluate convolution integrals.

Solution We could evaluate this integral by expanding (t − τ )5 in powers of τ and then integrating.
However, the convolution theorem provides an easier way. The integral is the convolution of f(t) = t5

is a Volterra integral equation. Here f and k are given functions and y is unknown. Since the integral
on the right is a convolution integral, the convolution theorem provides a convenient formula for solving
(8.6.11). Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.11) yields
Y (s) = F (s) + K(s)Y (s),
and solving this for Y (s) yields
Y (s) =

F (s)

1 − K(s)

We then obtain the solution of (8.6.11) as y = L−1 (Y ).

Transfer Functions
The next theorem presents a formula for the solution of the general initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t),

y(0) = k0 ,

y0 (0) = k1 ,

where we assume for simplicity that f is continuous on [0, ∞) and that L(f) exists. In Exercises 11–14
it’s shown that the formula is valid under much weaker conditions on f.
Theorem 8.6.3 Suppose f is continuous on [0, ∞) and has a Laplace transform. Then the solution of the
initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t), y(0) = k0 , y0 (0) = k1 ,

(8.6.17)

448 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms
Proof

Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.13) yields
p(s)Y (s) = F (s) + a(k1 + k0 s) + bk0 ,

where
p(s) = as2 + bs + c.
Hence,
Y (s) = W (s)F (s) + V (s)
with

a(k1 + k0 s) + bk0

p(s)

(8.6.20)

W (s) =
and
V (s) =

(8.6.18)

Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.15) and (8.6.16) shows that
p(s)Y1 (s) = as + b

and p(s)Y2 (s) = a.

Therefore
Y1 (s) =

as + b
p(s)

Y2 (s) =

a
.
p(s)

and

(8.6.21)

Hence, (8.6.20) can be rewritten as
V (s) = k0 Y1 (s) + k1 Y2 (s).
Substituting this into (8.6.18) yields
1
Y (s) = k0 Y1 (s) + k1 Y2 (s) + Y2 (s)F (s).
a
Taking inverse transforms and invoking the convolution theorem yields (8.6.14). Finally, (8.6.19) and
(8.6.21) imply (8.6.17).
It is useful to note from (8.6.14) that y is of the form
y = v + h,
where
v(t) = k0 y1 (t) + k1 y2 (t)
depends on the initial conditions and is independent of the forcing function, while
Z t
h(t) =
w(τ )f(t − τ ) dτ
0

depends on the forcing function and is independent of the initial conditions. If the zeros of the characteristic polynomial
p(s) = as2 + bs + c
of the complementary equation have negative real parts, then y1 and y2 both approach zero as t → ∞,
so limt→∞ v(t) = 0 for any choice of initial conditions. Moreover, the value of h(t) is essentially

Section 8.6 Convolution

449

independent of the values of f(t − τ ) for large τ , since limτ→∞ w(τ ) = 0. In this case we say that v and
h are transient and steady state components, respectively, of the solution y of (8.6.13). These definitions
apply to the initial value problem of Example 8.6.4, where the zeros of
p(s) = s2 + 2s + 2 = (s + 1)2 + 1
are −1 ± i. From (8.6.10), we see that the solution of the general initial value problem of Example 8.6.4
is y = v + h, where
v(t) = e−t ((k1 + k0 ) sin t + k0 cos t)
is the transient component of the solution and
Z t
h(t) =
f(t − τ )e−τ sin τ dτ
0

is the steady state component. The definitions don’t apply to the initial value problems considered in
Examples 8.6.2 and 8.6.3, since the zeros of the characteristic polynomials in these two examples don’t
have negative real parts.
In physical applications where the input f and the output y of a device are related by (8.6.13), the
zeros of the characteristic polynomial usually do have negative real parts. Then W = L(w) is called the
transfer function of the device. Since
H(s) = W (s)F (s),
we see that
W (s) =

H(s)
F (s)

is the ratio of the transform of the steady state output to the transform of the input.
Because of the form of
Z t
h(t) =
w(τ )f(t − τ ) dτ,
0

w is sometimes called the weighting function of the device, since it assigns weights to past values of the
input f. It is also called the impulse response of the device, for reasons discussed in the next section.
Formula (8.6.14) is given in more detail in Exercises 8–10 for the three possible cases where the zeros
of p(s) are real and distinct, real and repeated, or complex conjugates, respectively.

8.7 CONSTANT COEFFICIENT EQUATIONS WITH IMPULSES
So far in this chapter, we’ve considered initial value problems for the constant coefficient equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t),

454 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms
where f is continuous or piecewise continuous on [0, ∞). In this section we consider initial value problems where f represents a force that’s very large for a short time and zero otherwise. We say that such
forces are impulsive. Impulsive forces occur, for example, when two objects collide. Since it isn’t feasible
to represent such forces as continuous or piecewise continuous functions, we must construct a different
mathematical model to deal with them.
R t +h
If f is an integrable function and f(t) = 0 for t outside of the interval [t0 , t0 + h], then t00 f(t) dt
is called the total impulse of f. We’re interested in the idealized situation where h is so small that the
total impulse can be assumed to be applied instantaneously at t = t0 . We say in this case that f is an
impulse function. In particular, we denote by δ(t − t0 ) the impulse function with total impulse equal to
one, applied at t = t0 . (The impulse function δ(t) obtained by setting t0 = 0 is the Dirac δ function.) It
must be understood, however, that δ(t − t0 ) isn’t a function in the standard sense, since our “definition”
implies that δ(t − t0 ) = 0 if t 6= t0 , while
Z t0
δ(t − t0 ) dt = 1.
t0

From calculus we know that no function can have these properties; nevertheless, there’s a branch of
mathematics known as the theory of distributions where the definition can be made rigorous. Since the
theory of distributions is beyond the scope of this book, we’ll take an intuitive approach to impulse
functions.
Our first task is to define what we mean by the solution of the initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = δ(t − t0 ),

y(0) = 0,

y0 (0) = 0,

where t0 is a fixed nonnegative number. The next theorem will motivate our definition.
Theorem 8.7.1 Suppose t0 ≥ 0. For each positive number h, let yh be the solution of the initial value
problem
ayh00 + byh0 + cyh = fh (t), yh (0) = 0, yh0 (0) = 0,
(8.7.1)
where
fh (t) =




0,

0 ≤ t < t0 ,

1/h, t0 ≤ t < t0 + h,
0,

(8.7.2)

t ≥ t0 + h,

so fh has unit total impulse equal to the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 8.7.1. Then
lim yh (t) = u(t − t0 )w(t − t0 ),

h→0+

where
w=L
Proof

Taking Laplace transforms in (8.7.1) yields

Now let Mh be the maximum value of |w(t − τ ) − w(t − t0 )| as τ varies over the interval [t0 , t0 + h].
(Remember that t and t0 are fixed.) Then (8.7.8) and (8.7.9) imply that

dτ = Mh .

|yh (t) − w(t − t0 )| ≤ Mh

t0
But limh→0+ Mh = 0, since w is continuous. Therefore (8.7.10) implies (8.7.6). This and (8.7.5) imply
(8.7.3).
Theorem 8.7.1 motivates the next definition.
Definition 8.7.2 If t0 > 0, then the solution of the initial value problem
ay00 + by0 + cy = δ(t − t0 ),

y(0) = 0,

y0 (0) = 0,

is defined to be

In physical applications where the input f and the output y of a device are related by the differential
equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = f(t),
w is called the impulse response of the device. Note that w is the solution of the initial value problem
aw 00 + bw 0 + cw = 0,

w(0) = 0,

w 0 (0) = 1/a,

(8.7.12)

as can be seen by using the Laplace transform to solve this problem. (Verify.) On the other hand, we can
solve (8.7.12) by the methods of Section 5.2 and show that w is defined on (−∞, ∞) by
w=

depending upon whether the polynomial p(r) = ar 2 + br + c has distinct real zeros r1 and r2 , a repeated
zero r1 , or complex conjugate zeros λ ± iω. (In most physical applications, the zeros of the characteristic
polynomial have negative real parts, so limt→∞ w(t) = 0.) This means that y = u(t − t0 )w(t − t0 ) is
defined on (−∞, ∞) and has the following properties:

(remember that y−
(t0 ) and y+
(t0 ) are derivatives from the right and left, respectively) and y0 (t0 ) does
not exist. Thus, even though we defined y = u(t−t0 )w(t−t0 ) to be the solution of (8.7.11), this function
doesn’t satisfy the differential equation in (8.7.11) at t0 , since it isn’t differentiable there; in fact (8.7.14)
indicates that an impulse causes a jump discontinuity in velocity. (To see that this is reasonable, think of
what happens when you hit a ball with a bat.) This means that the initial value problem (8.7.11) doesn’t
make sense if t0 = 0, since y0 (0) doesn’t exist in this case. However y = u(t)w(t) can be defined to be
the solution of the modified initial value problem

ay00 + by0 + cy = δ(t),

y(0) = 0,

0
y−
(0) = 0,

where the condition on the derivative at t = 0 has been replaced by a condition on the derivative from the
left.
Figure 8.7.2 illustrates Theorem 8.7.1 for the case where the impulse response w is the first expression
in (8.7.13) and r1 and r2 are distinct and both negative. The solid curve in the figure is the graph of w.
The dashed curves are solutions of (8.7.1) for various values of h. As h decreases the graph of yh moves
to the left toward the graph of w.
Example 8.7.1 Find the solution of the initial value problem
y00 − 2y0 + y = δ(t − t0 ),

y0 (0) = 0,

where t0 > 0. Then interpret the solution for the case where t0 = 0.

Definition 8.7.3 Suppose α is a nonzero constant and f is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞). If t0 > 0,
then the solution of the initial value problem

This definition also applies if t0 = 0, provided that the initial condition y0 (0) = k1 is replaced by

INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR HIGHER ORDER EQUATIONS

An nth order differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written in the form
y(n) + p1 (x)y(n−1) + · · · + pn (x)y = f(x).

(9.1.1)

We considered equations of this form with n = 1 in Section 2.1 and with n = 2 in Chapter 5. In this
chapter n is an arbitrary positive integer.
In this section we sketch the general theory of linear nth order equations. Since this theory has already
been discussed for n = 2 in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, we’ll omit proofs.
For convenience, we consider linear differential equations written as
P0 (x)y(n) + P1 (x)y(n−1) + · · · + Pn (x)y = F (x),

(9.1.2)

which can be rewritten as (9.1.1) on any interval on which P0 has no zeros, with p1 = P1 /P0 , . . . ,
pn = Pn /P0 and f = F/P0 . For simplicity, throughout this chapter we’ll abbreviate the left side of
(9.1.2) by Ly; that is,
Ly = P0 y(n) + P1 y(n−1) + · · · + Pn y.

We say that the equation Ly = F is normal on (a, b) if P0 , P1 , . . . , Pn and F are continuous on (a, b)
and P0 has no zeros on (a, b). If this is so then Ly = F can be written as (9.1.1) with p1 , . . . , pn and f
continuous on (a, b).
The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.3.1.

Theorem 9.1.1 Suppose Ly = F is normal on (a, b), let x0 be a point in (a, b), and let k0 , k1 , . . . , kn−1
be arbitrary real numbers. Then the initial value problem
Ly = F,

y(x0 ) = k0 ,

y0 (x0 ) = k1 , . . . ,

y(n−1) (x0 ) = kn−1

has a unique solution on (a, b).
Homogeneous Equations
Eqn. (9.1.2) is said to be homogeneous if F ≡ 0 and nonhomogeneous otherwise. Since y ≡ 0 is
obviously a solution of Ly = 0, we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is nontrivial.
If y1 , y2 , . . . , yn are defined on (a, b) and c1 , c2 , . . . , cn are constants, then
y = c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn

(9.1.3)

is a linear combination of {y1 , y2 . . . , yn }. It’s easy to show that if y1 , y2 , . . . , yn are solutions of Ly = 0
on (a, b), then so is any linear combination of {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn }. (See the proof of Theorem 5.1.2.) We
say that {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0 on (a, b) if every solution of Ly = 0
on (a, b) can be written as a linear combination of {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn }, as in (9.1.3). In this case we say that
(9.1.3) is the general solution of Ly = 0 on (a, b).
It can be shown (Exercises 14 and 15) that if the equation Ly = 0 is normal on (a, b) then it has infinitely many fundamental sets of solutions on (a, b). The next definition will help to identify fundamental
sets of solutions of Ly = 0.
We say that {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is linearly independent on (a, b) if the only constants c1 , c2 , . . . , cn such
that
c1 y1 (x) + c2 y2 (x) + · · · + cn yn (x) = 0, a < x < b,
(9.1.4)
are c1 = c2 = · · · = cn = 0. If (9.1.4) holds for some set of constants c1 , c2 , . . . , cn that are not all zero,
then {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is linearly dependent on (a, b)
The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.1.3.

Section 9.1 Introduction to Linear Higher Order Equations

Theorem 9.1.2 If Ly = 0 is normal on (a, b), then a set {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } of n solutions of Ly = 0 on
(a, b) is a fundamental set if and only if it’s linearly independent on (a, b).
Example 9.1.1 The equation
x3 y000 − x2 y00 − 2xy0 + 6y = 0

(9.1.5)

is normal and has the solutions y1 = x , y2 = x , and y3 = 1/x on (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞). Show that
{y1 , y2 , y3 } is linearly independent on (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞). Then find the general solution of (9.1.5) on
(−∞, 0) and (0, ∞).
Solution Suppose

c3

(9.1.8)

By solving this system directly, you can verify that it has only the trivial solution c1 = c2 = c3 =
0; however, for our purposes it’s more useful to recall from linear algebra that a homogeneous linear
system of n equations in n unknowns has only the trivial solution if its determinant is nonzero. Since the
determinant of (9.1.8) is
1 1
1
1 0
0
2 3 −1 = 2 1 −3 = 12,
2 6
2
2 4

it follows that (9.1.8) has only the trivial solution, so {y1 , y2 , y3 } is linearly independent on (0, ∞). Now
Theorem 9.1.2 implies that
c3
y = c1 x 2 + c2 x 3 +
x
is the general solution of (9.1.5) on (0, ∞). To see that this is also true on (−∞, 0), assume that (9.1.6)
holds on (−∞, 0). Setting x = −1 in (9.1.7) yields
c1 − c2 − c3
−2c1 + 3c2 − c3
2c1 − 6c2 − 2c3

it follows that c1 = c2 = c3 = 0; that is, {y1 , y2 , y3 } is linearly independent on (−∞, 0).

468 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations
Example 9.1.2 The equation
y(4) + y000 − 7y00 − y0 + 6y = 0

(9.1.9)

is normal and has the solutions y1 = ex , y2 = e−x , y3 = e2x , and y4 = e−3x on (−∞, ∞). (Verify.)
Show that {y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 } is linearly independent on (−∞, ∞). Then find the general solution of (9.1.9).
Solution Suppose c1 , c2 , c3 , and c4 are constants such that
c1 ex + c2 e−x + c3 e2x + c4 e−3x = 0

(9.1.10)

for all x. We must show that c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 = 0. Differentiating (9.1.10) three times yields the
system
c1 ex + c2 e−x + c3 e2x + c4 e−3x = 0
c1 ex − c2 e−x + 2c3 e2x − 3c4 e−3x = 0
(9.1.11)
c1 ex + c2 e−x + 4c3 e2x + 9c4 e−3x = 0
c1 ex − c2 e−x + 8c3 e2x − 27c4 e−3x = 0.
If (9.1.11) holds for all x, then it certainly holds for x = 0. Therefore
c1 + c2 + c3 + c4
c1 − c2 + 2c3 − 3c4
c1 + c2 + 4c3 + 9c4
c1 − c2 + 8c3 − 27c4

so the system has only the trivial solution c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 = 0. Now Theorem 9.1.2 implies that
y = c1 ex + c2 e−x + c3 e2x + c4 e−3x
is the general solution of (9.1.9).
The Wronskian
We can use the method used in Examples 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 to test n solutions {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } of any nth
order equation Ly = 0 for linear independence on an interval (a, b) on which the equation is normal.
Thus, if c1 , c2 ,. . . , cn are constants such that
c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn = 0,

a < x < b,

then differentiating n − 1 times leads to the n × n system of equations

We call this determinant the Wronskian of {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn }. If W (x) 6= 0 for some x in (a, b) then the

y = c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn
is the general solution of Ly = 0 on (a, b).
The next theorem generalizes Theorem 5.1.4. The proof is sketched in (Exercises 17–20).
Theorem 9.1.3 Suppose the homogeneous linear nth order equation
P0 (x)y(n) + P1 (x)yn−1 + · · · + Pn (x)y = 0

(9.1.14)

is normal on (a, b), let y1 , y2 , . . . , yn be solutions of (9.1.14) on (a, b), and let x0 be in (a, b). Then the

Therefore, either W has no zeros in (a, b) or W ≡ 0 on (a, b).
Formula (9.1.15) is Abel’s formula.
The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.1.6..
Theorem 9.1.4 Suppose Ly = 0 is normal on (a, b) and let y1 , y2 , . . . , yn be n solutions of Ly = 0 on
(a, b). Then the following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either all true or all false:
(a) The general solution of Ly = 0 on (a, b) is y = c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn .
(b) {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0 on (a, b).
(c) {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is linearly independent on (a, b).

(d) The Wronskian of {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is nonzero at some point in (a, b).
(e) The Wronskian of {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is nonzero at all points in (a, b).

Example 9.1.3 In Example 9.1.1 we saw that the solutions y1 = x2 , y2 = x3 , and y3 = 1/x of
x3 y000 − x2 y00 − 2xy0 + 6y = 0
are linearly independent on (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞). Calculate the Wronskian of {y1 , y2 , y3 }.

General Solution of a Nonhomogeneous Equation
The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.3.2. It shows how to find the general solution of Ly = F
if we know a particular solution of Ly = F and a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary
equation Ly = 0.
Theorem 9.1.6 Suppose Ly = F is normal on (a, b). Let yp be a particular solution of Ly = F on
(a, b), and let {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } be a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation Ly = 0
on (a, b). Then y is a solution of Ly = F on (a, b) if and only if
y = yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn ,
where c1 , c2 , . . . , cn are constants.
The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.3.2.
Theorem 9.1.7 [The Principle of Superposition] Suppose for each i = 1, 2, . . . , r, the function ypi is a

yp = yp1 + yp2 + · · · + ypr

9.2 HIGHER ORDER CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS
If a0 , a1 , . . . , an are constants and a0 6= 0, then

a0 y(n) + a1 y(n−1) + · · · + an y = F (x)

is said to be a constant coefficient equation. In this section we consider the homogeneous constant coefficient equation
a0 y(n) + a1 y(n−1) + · · · + an y = 0.
(9.2.1)

Since (9.2.1) is normal on (−∞, ∞), the theorems in Section 9.1 all apply with (a, b) = (−∞, ∞).
As in Section 5.2, we call
p(r) = a0 r n + a1 r n−1 + · · · + an
(9.2.2)

the characteristic polynomial of (9.2.1). We saw in Section 5.2 that when n = 2 the solutions of (9.2.1)
are determined by the zeros of the characteristic polynomial. This is also true when n > 2, but the
situation is more complicated in this case. Consequently, we take a different approach here than in
Section 5.2.
If k is a positive integer, let Dk stand for the k-th derivative operator; that is
Dk y = y(k) .
If
q(r) = b0 r m + b1 r m−1 + · · · + bm

is an arbitrary polynomial, define the operator

q(D) = b0 Dm + b1 Dm−1 + · · · + bm
such that
q(D)y = (b0 Dm + b1 Dm−1 + · · · + bm )y = b0 y(m) + b1 y(m−1) + · · · + bm y
whenever y is a function with m derivatives. We call q(D) a polynomial operator.
With p as in (9.2.2),
p(D) = a0 Dn + a1 Dn−1 + · · · + an ,

so (9.2.1) can be written as p(D)y = 0. If r is a constant then
p(D)erx

=
=

a0 Dn erx + a1 Dn−1 erx + · · · + an erx

(a0 r n + a1 r n−1 + · · · + an )erx ;



that is
p(D)(erx ) = p(r)erx .
This shows that y = erx is a solution of (9.2.1) if p(r) = 0. In the simplest case, where p has n distinct
real zeros r1 , r2 ,. . . , rn , this argument yields n solutions
y1 = er1 x ,

y2 = er2 x , . . . ,

yn = ern x .

It can be shown (Exercise 39) that the Wronskian of {er1 x , er2 x , . . . , ern x } is nonzero if r1 , r2 , . . . , rn
are distinct; hence, {er1 x , er2 x , . . . , ern x } is a fundamental set of solutions of p(D)y = 0 in this case.

Example 9.2.1
(a) Find the general solution of
y000 − 6y00 + 11y0 − 6y = 0.

(9.2.3)

(b) Solve the initial value problem
y000 − 6y00 + 11y0 − 6y = 0,

y(0) = 4,

y0 (0) = 5,

y00 (0) = 9.

(9.2.4)

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.3) is
p(r) = r 3 − 6r 2 + 11r − 6 = (r − 1)(r − 2)(r − 3).
Therefore {ex , e2x , e3x} is a set of solutions of (9.2.3). It is a fundamental set, since its Wronskian is
W (x) =

= 2e6x 6= 0.

Therefore the general solution of (9.2.3) is
y = c1 ex + c2 e2x + c3 e3x .

(9.2.5)

S OLUTION (b) We must determine c1 , c2 and c3 in (9.2.5) so that y satisfies the initial conditions in
(9.2.4). Differentiating (9.2.5) twice yields
y0
y00

=
=

c1 ex + 2c2 e2x + 3c3 e3x
c1 ex + 4c2 e2x + 9c3 e3x .

(9.2.6)

Setting x = 0 in (9.2.5) and (9.2.6) and imposing the initial conditions yields
c1 + c2 + c3
c1 + 2c2 + 3c3
c1 + 4c2 + 9c3

= 4
= 5
= 9.

The solution of this system is c1 = 4, c2 = −1, c3 = 1. Therefore the solution of (9.2.4) is
y = 4ex − e2x + e3x
(Figure 9.2.1).
Now we consider the case where the characteristic polynomial (9.2.2) does not have n distinct real
zeros. For this purpose it is useful to define what we mean by a factorization of a polynomial operator.
We begin with an example.
Example 9.2.2 Consider the polynomial
p(r) = r 3 − r 2 + r − 1
and the associated polynomial operator
p(D) = D3 − D2 + D − 1.

Since p(r) can be factored as
p(r) = (r − 1)(r 2 + 1) = (r 2 + 1)(r − 1),
it’s reasonable to expect that p(D) can be factored as
p(D) = (D − 1)(D2 + 1) = (D2 + 1)(D − 1).

(9.2.7)

However, before we can make this assertion we must define what we mean by saying that two operators
are equal, and what we mean by the products of operators in (9.2.7). We say that two operators are equal
if they apply to the same functions and always produce the same result. The definitions of the products in
(9.2.7) is this: if y is any three-times differentiable function then
(a) (D − 1)(D2 + 1)y is the function obtained by first applying D2 + 1 to y and then applying D − 1
to the resulting function
(b) (D2 + 1)(D − 1)y is the function obtained by first applying D − 1 to y and then applying D2 + 1
to the resulting function.
From (a),
(D − 1)(D2 + 1)y = (D − 1)[(D2 + 1)y]
= (D − 1)(y00 + y) = D(y00 + y) − (y00 + y)

= y − y + y − y = (D − D + D − 1)y.
This implies that
(D − 1)(D2 + 1) = (D3 − D2 + D − 1).

(9.2.9)

(D2 + 1)(D − 1) = (D3 − D2 + D − 1),
which completes the justification of (9.2.7).

Example 9.2.3 Use the result of Example 9.2.2 to find the general solution of
y000 − y00 + y0 − y = 0.

(9.2.10)

Solution From (9.2.8), we can rewrite (9.2.10) as
(D − 1)(D2 + 1)y = 0,
which implies that any solution of (D2 + 1)y = 0 is a solution of (9.2.10). Therefore y1 = cos x and
y2 = sin x are solutions of (9.2.10).
From (9.2.9), we can rewrite (9.2.10) as
(D2 + 1)(D − 1)y = 0,
which implies that any solution of (D − 1)y = 0 is a solution of (9.2.10). Therefore y3 = ex is solution
of (9.2.10).

y = c1 cos x + c2 sin x + c3 ex
is the general solution of (9.2.10).
Example 9.2.4 Find the general solution of
y(4) − 16y = 0.

(9.2.11)

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.11) is
p(r) = r 4 − 16 = (r 2 − 4)(r 2 + 4) = (r − 2)(r + 2)(r 2 + 4).
By arguments similar to those used in Examples 9.2.2 and 9.2.3, it can be shown that (9.2.11) can be
written as
(D2 + 4)(D + 2)(D − 2)y = 0

480 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations
or
(D2 + 4)(D − 2)(D + 2)y = 0
or
(D − 2)(D + 2)(D2 + 4)y = 0.
Therefore y is a solution of (9.2.11) if it’s a solution of any of the three equations
(D − 2)y = 0,

(D + 2)y = 0,

(D2 + 4)y = 0.

Hence, {e2x , e−2x, cos 2x, sin 2x} is a set of solutions of (9.2.11). The Wronskian of this set is
W (x) =

{e2x , e−2x, cos 2x, sin 2x} is linearly independent, and
y1 = c1 e2x + c2 e−2x + c3 cos 2x + c4 sin 2x
is the general solution of (9.2.11).
It is known from algebra that every polynomial
p(r) = a0 r n + a1 r n−1 + · · · + an
with real coefficients can be factored as
p(r) = a0 p1 (r)p2 (r) · · · pk (r),
where no pair of the polynomials p1 , p2 , . . . , pk has a commom factor and each is either of the form
pj (r) = (r − rj )mj ,
where rj is real and mj is a positive integer, or

mj
,
pj (r) = (r − λj )2 + ωj2

(9.2.12)

(9.2.13)

where λj and ωj are real, ωj 6= 0, and mj is a positive integer. If (9.2.12) holds then rj is a real zero of
p, while if (9.2.13) holds then λ + iω and λ − iω are complex conjugate zeros of p. In either case, mj is
the multiplicity of the zero(s).
By arguments similar to those used in our examples, it can be shown that
p(D) = a0 p1 (D)p2 (D) · · · pk (D)

(9.2.14)

and that the order of the factors on the right can be chosen arbitrarily. Therefore, if pj (D)y = 0 for some
j then p(D)y = 0. To see this, we simply rewrite (9.2.14) so that pj (D) is applied first. Therefore the

Section 9.2 Higher Order Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations

481

problem of finding solutions of p(D)y = 0 with p as in (9.2.14) reduces to finding solutions of each of
these equations
pj (D)y = 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ k,

where pj is a power of a first degree term or of an irreducible quadratic. To find a fundamental set of
solutions {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } of p(D)y = 0, we find fundamental set of solutions of each of the equations
and take {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } to be the set of all functions in these separate fundamental sets. In Exercise 40
we sketch the proof that {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is linearly independent, and therefore a fundamental set of
solutions of p(D)y = 0.
To apply this procedure to general homogeneous constant coefficient equations, we must be able to
find fundamental sets of solutions of equations of the form
(D − a)m y = 0
and


m
(D − λ)2 + ω2 y = 0,

where m is an arbitrary positive integer. The next two theorems show how to do this.
Theorem 9.2.1 If m is a positive integer, then
{eax , xeax , . . . , xm−1 eax }

(9.2.15)

(D − a)m y = 0.

(9.2.16)

is a fundamental set of solutions of
Proof

We’ll show that if
f(x) = c1 + c2 x + · · · + cm xm−1

is an arbitrary polynomial of degree ≤ m − 1, then y = eax f is a solution of (9.2.16). First note that if g
is any differentiable function then
(D − a)eax g = Deax g − aeax g = aeax g + eax g0 − aeax g,
so
(D − a)eax g = eax g0 .

Therefore

(9.2.17)

(D − a)eax f
(D − a)2 eax f
(D − a)3 eax f

= eax f 0
= (D − a)eax f 0 = eax f 00
= (D − a)eax f 00 = eax f 000
..
.

(from (9.2.17) with g = f)
(from (9.2.17) with g = f 0 )
(from (9.2.17) with g = f 00 )

(D − a)m eax f

= (D − a)eax f (m−1) = eax f (m)

(from (9.2.17) with g = f (m−1) ).

Since f (m) = 0, the last equation implies that y = eax f is a solution of (9.2.16) if f is any polynomial
of degree ≤ m − 1. In particular, each function in (9.2.15) is a solution of (9.2.16). To see that (9.2.15)
is linearly independent (and therefore a fundamental set of solutions of (9.2.16)), note that if
c1 eax + c2 xeax + c · · · + cm−1 xm−1 eax = 0
for all x in some interval (a, b), then
c1 + c2 x + c · · · + cm−1 xm−1 = 0
for all x in (a, b). However, we know from algebra that if this polynomial has more than m − 1 zeros then
c1 = c2 = · · · = cn = 0.

(9.2.18)

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.18) is
p(r) = r 3 + 3r 2 + 3r + 1 = (r + 1)3 .
Therefore (9.2.18) can be written as
(D + 1)3 y = 0,
so Theorem 9.2.1 implies that the general solution of (9.2.18) is
y = e−x (c1 + c2 x + c3 x2 ).
The proof of the next theorem is sketched in Exercise 41.
Theorem 9.2.2 If ω 6= 0 and m is a positive integer, then

(9.2.19)

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.19) is
p(r) = (r 2 + 4r + 13)3 = (r + 2)2 + 9
Therefore (9.2.19) can be be written as

.

[(D + 2)2 + 9]3 y = 0,
so Theorem 9.2.2 implies that the general solution of (9.2.19) is

A theorem from algebra says that if P1 and P2 are polynomials with no common factors then there
are polynomials Q1 and Q2 such that

and no two of the polynomials p1 , p2 , . . . , pk have a common factor. Show that we can

9.3 UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS FOR HIGHER ORDER EQUATIONS
In this section we consider the constant coefficient equation
a0 y(n) + a1 y(n−1) + · · · + an y = F (x),

(9.3.1)

where n ≥ 3 and F is a linear combination of functions of the form

or






p0 + p1 x + · · · + pk xk cos ωx + q0 + q1 x + · · · + qk xk sin ωx .

From Theorem 9.1.5, the general solution of (9.3.1) is y = yp + yc , where yp is a particular solution of
(9.3.1) and yc is the general solution of the complementary equation
a0 y(n) + a1 y(n−1) + · · · + an y = 0.
In Section 9.2 we learned how to find yc . Here we will learn how to find yp when the forcing function
has the form stated above. The procedure that we use is a generalization of the method that we used in
Sections 5.4 and 5.5, and is again called method of undetermined coefficients. Since the underlying ideas
are the same as those in Sections 5.4 and 5.5, we’ll give an informal presentation based on examples.

Forcing Functions of the Form eαx p0 + p1 x + · · · + pk xk
We first consider equations of the form


a0 y(n) + a1 y(n−1) + · · · + an y = eαx p0 + p1 x + · · · + pk xk .

into (9.3.2) and canceling ex yields
(u000 + 3u00 + 3u0 + u) + 3(u00 + 2u0 + u) + 2(u0 + u) − u = 21 + 24x + 28x2 + 5x3 ,
or
u000 + 6u00 + 11u0 + 5u = 21 + 24x + 28x2 + 5x3 .

(9.3.3)

Since the unknown u appears on the left, we can see that (9.3.3) has a particular solution of the form
up = A + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3 .
Then
u0p

(5A + 11B + 12C + 6D) + (5B + 22C + 36D)x
+(5C + 33D)x2 + 5Dx3 .

Comparing coefficients of like powers of x on the right sides of this equation and (9.3.3) shows that up
satisfies (9.3.3) if
5D =
5
5C + 33D = 28
5B + 22C + 36D = 24
5A + 11B + 12C + 6D = 21.
Solving these equations successively yields D = 1, C = −1, B = 2, A = 1. Therefore
up = 1 + 2x − x2 + x3
is a particular solution of (9.3.3), so
yp = ex up = ex (1 + 2x − x2 + x3 )
is a particular solution of (9.3.2) (Figure 9.3.1).

−6(u00 + 4u0 + 4u) + 4(u0 + 2u) + 8u = 4 + 19x + 6x2 ,
or
u(4) + 7u000 + 12u00 = 4 + 19x + 6x2 .

(9.3.5)

Since neither u nor u0 appear on the left, we can see that (9.3.5) has a particular solution of the form
up = Ax2 + Bx3 + Cx4 .
Then

satisfies (9.3.5) if
144C = 6
72B + 168C = 19
24A + 42B + 24C = 4.
Solving these equations successively yields C = 1/24, B = 1/6, A = −1/6. Substituting these into

(u000 + 3u00 + 3u0 + u) + (u00 + 2u0 + u) − 4(u0 + u) − 4u = (5 − 5x) cos x + (2 + 5x) sin x,
or
u000 + 4u00 + u0 − 6u = (5 − 5x) cos x + (2 + 5x) sin x.

(9.3.8)

Since cos x and sin x are not solutions of the complementary equation
u000 + 4u00 + u0 − 6u = 0,

a theorem analogous to Theorem 5.5.1 implies that (9.3.8) has a particular solution of the form
up = (A0 + A1 x) cos x + (B0 + B1 x) sin x.

(9.3.9)

Then
u0p = (A1 + B0 + B1 x) cos x + (B1 − A0 − A1 x) sin x,

u00p = (2B1 − A0 − A1 x) cos x − (2A1 + B0 + B1 x) sin x,

p = −(3A1 + B0 + B1 x) cos x − (3B1 − A0 − A1 x) sin x,

9.4 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS FOR HIGHER ORDER EQUATIONS
Derivation of the method
We assume throughout this section that the nonhomogeneous linear equation
P0 (x)y(n) + P1 (x)y(n−1) + · · · + Pn (x)y = F (x)

(9.4.1)

is normal on an interval (a, b). We’ll abbreviate this equation as Ly = F , where
Ly = P0 (x)y(n) + P1 (x)y(n−1) + · · · + Pn (x)y.
When we speak of solutions of this equation and its complementary equation Ly = 0, we mean solutions
on (a, b). We’ll show how to use the method of variation of parameters to find a particular solution of
Ly = F , provided that we know a fundamental set of solutions {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } of Ly = 0.
We seek a particular solution of Ly = F in the form
yp = u1 y1 + u2 y2 + · · · + un yn

(9.4.2)

where {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is a known fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation
P0 (x)y(n) + P1 (x)y(n−1) + · · · + Pn (x)y = 0
and u1 , u2 , . . . , un are functions to be determined. We begin by imposing the following n − 1 conditions
on u1 , u2, . . . , un :
u01 y1 + u02 y2 + · · · +u0n yn = 0
u01 y10 + u02 y20 + · · · +u0n yn0 = 0

(9.4.4)

Section 9.4 Variation of Parameters for Higher Order Equations

499

These formulas are easy to remember, since they look as though we obtained them by differentiating
(9.4.2) n − 1 times while treating u1 , u2 , . . . , un as constants. To see that (9.4.3) implies (9.4.4), we first
differentiate (9.4.2) to obtain
yp0 = u1 y10 + u2 y20 + · · · + un yn0 + u01 y1 + u02 y2 + · · · + u0n yn ,
which reduces to
yp0 = u1 y10 + u2 y20 + · · · + un yn0

because of the first equation in (9.4.3). Differentiating this yields

yp00 = u1 y100 + u2 y200 + · · · + un yn00 + u01 y10 + u02 y20 + · · · + u0n yn0 ,
which reduces to
yp00 = u1 y100 + u2 y200 + · · · + un yn00

because of the second equation in (9.4.3). Continuing in this way yields (9.4.4).
The last equation in (9.4.4) is
(n−1)

yp(n−1) = u1 y1

(n−1)

+ u2 y2

+ · · · + un yn(n−1) .

Differentiating this yields

(n−1)

+ · · · + un yn(n) + u01 y1

Substituting this and (9.4.4) into (9.4.1) yields

500 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations
The determinant of this system is the Wronskian W of the fundamental set of solutions {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn },
which has no zeros on (a, b), by Theorem 9.1.4. Solving (9.4.5) by Cramer’s rule yields
u0j = (−1)n−j

1 ≤ j ≤ n,

(9.4.6)

where Wj is the Wronskian of the set of functions obtained by deleting yj from {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } and
keeping the remaining functions in the same order. Equivalently, Wj is the determinant obtained by
deleting the last row and j-th column of W .
Having obtained u01 , u02 , . . . ,u0n, we can integrate to obtain u1 , u2 , . . . , un . As in Section 5.7, we take
the constants of integration to be zero, and we drop any linear combination of {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } that may
appear in yp .
R EMARK: For efficiency, it’s best to compute W1 , W2 , . . . , Wn first, and then compute W by expanding
in cofactors of the last row; thus,

4ex W3 =

4ex (ex (x − 1)) = 4e2x(x − 1).

Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be zero yields
u1 = −8ex ,

u2 = 2(x + 1)2 , u3 = e2x (2x − 3).

Hence,
yp

(−8ex )x + ex (2(x + 1)2 ) + e−x e2x(2x − 3)

Since −ex is a solution of the complementary equation, we redefine
yp = 2xex (x − 1).
Therefore the general solution of (9.4.8) is
y = 2xex (x − 1) + c1 x + c2 ex + c3 e−x .

INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Many physical situations are modelled by systems of n differential equations in n unknown functions,
where n ≥ 2. The next three examples illustrate physical problems that lead to systems of differential
equations. In these examples and throughout this chapter we’ll denote the independent variable by t.
Example 10.1.1 Tanks T1 and T2 contain 100 gallons and 300 gallons of salt solutions, respectively. Salt
solutions are simultaneously added to both tanks from external sources, pumped from each tank to the
other, and drained from both tanks (Figure 10.1.1). A solution with 1 pound of salt per gallon is pumped
into T1 from an external source at 5 gal/min, and a solution with 2 pounds of salt per gallon is pumped

Example 10.1.2 A mass m1 is suspended from a rigid support on a spring S1 and a second mass m2
is suspended from the first on a spring S2 (Figure 10.1.2). The springs obey Hooke’s law, with spring
constants k1 and k2 . Internal friction causes the springs to exert damping forces proportional to the rates
of change of their lengths, with damping constants c1 and c2 . Let y1 = y1 (t) and y2 = y2 (t) be the
displacements of the two masses from their equilibrium positions at time t, measured positive upward.
Derive a system of differential equations for y1 and y2 , assuming that the masses of the springs are
negligible and that vertical external forces F1 and F2 also act on the objects.

Figure 10.1.2
Solution In equilibrium, S1 supports both m1 and m2 and S2 supports only m2 . Therefore, if ∆`1 and
∆`2 are the elongations of the springs in equilibrium then
(m1 + m2 )g = k1 ∆`1

and

m2 g = k2 ∆`2 .

(10.1.7)

Let H1 be the Hooke’s law force acting on m1 , and let D1 be the damping force on m1 . Similarly, let
H2 and D2 be the Hooke’s law and damping forces acting on m2 . According to Newton’s second law of
motion,
m1 y100 = −m1 g + H1 + D1 + F1 ,
(10.1.8)
m2 y200 = −m2 g + H2 + D2 + F2 .
When the displacements are y1 and y2 , the change in length of S1 is −y1 + ∆`1 and the change in length
of S2 is −y2 + y1 + ∆`2 . Both springs exert Hooke’s law forces on m1 , while only S2 exerts a Hooke’s
law force on m2 . These forces are in directions that tend to restore the springs to their natural lengths.
Therefore
H1 = k1 (−y1 + ∆`1 ) − k2 (−y2 + y1 + ∆`2 )

and

H2 = k2 (−y2 + y1 + ∆`2 ).

(10.1.9)

When the velocities are y10 and y20 , S1 and S2 are changing length at the rates −y10 and −y20 + y10 , respectively. Both springs exert damping forces on m1 , while only S2 exerts a damping force on m2 . Since the
force due to damping exerted by a spring is proportional to the rate of change of length of the spring and
in a direction that opposes the change, it follows that
D1 = −c1 y10 + c2 (y20 − y10 )

and

D2 = −c2 (y20 − y10 ).

(10.1.11)

(10.1.12)

m1 g − k1 ∆`1 + k2 ∆`2 = −m2 g + k2 ∆`2 = 0.

Therefore we can rewrite (10.1.11) and (10.1.12) as

−(c1 + c2 )y10 + c2 y20 − (k1 + k2 )y1 + k2 y2 + F1

Example 10.1.3 Let X = X(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k be the position vector at time t of an object
with mass m, relative to a rectangular coordinate system with origin at Earth’s center (Figure 10.1.3).
According to Newton’s law of gravitation, Earth’s gravitational force F = F(x, y, z) on the object is
inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the object from Earth’s center, and directed toward
the center; thus,

is called a first order system, since the only derivatives occurring in it are first derivatives. The derivative
of each of the unknowns may depend upon the independent variable and all the unknowns, but not on
the derivatives of other unknowns. When we wish to emphasize the number of unknown functions in
(10.1.15) we will say that (10.1.15) is an n × n system.
Systems involving higher order derivatives can often be reformulated as first order systems by introducing additional unknowns. The next two examples illustrate this.

m2 y200

derived in Example 10.1.2 as a system of first order equations.
Solution If we define v1 = y10 and v2 = y20 , then v10 = y100 and v20 = y200 , so (10.1.16) becomes

R EMARK: The difference in form between (10.1.15) and (10.1.17), due to the way in which the unknowns
are denoted in the two systems, isn’t important; (10.1.17) is a first order system, in that each equation in
(10.1.17) expresses the first derivative of one of the unknown functions in a way that does not involve
derivatives of any of the other unknowns.
Example 10.1.5 Rewrite the system

Rewriting Scalar Differential Equations as Systems
In this chapter we’ll refer to differential equations involving only one unknown function as scalar differential equations. Scalar differential equations can be rewritten as systems of first order equations by the
method illustrated in the next two examples.
Example 10.1.6 Rewrite the equation
y(4) + 4y000 + 6y00 + 4y0 + y = 0
as a 4 × 4 first order system.
Solution We regard y, y0 , y00 , and y000 as unknowns and rename them
y = y1 ,

y0 = y2 ,

y00 = y3 ,

and

y000 = y4 .

Then y(4) = y40 , so (10.1.18) can be written as
y40 + 4y4 + 6y3 + 4y2 + y1 = 0.

(10.1.18)

514 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
Therefore {y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 } satisfies the system
y10
y20

y3
y4

y40

=

−4y4 − 6y3 − 4y2 − y1 .

Example 10.1.7 Rewrite
x000 = f(t, x, x0 , x00)
as a system of first order equations.
Solution We regard x, x0 , and x00 as unknowns and rename them
x0 = y2 ,

x = y1 ,

and

x00 = y3 .

Then
y10 = x0 = y2 ,

y20 = x00 = y3 ,

and

y30 = x000 .

Therefore {y1 , y2 , y3 } satisfies the first order system
y10

=

y2

y20
y30

y3
f(t, y1 , y2 , y3 ).

Since systems of differential equations involving higher derivatives can be rewritten as first order systems by the method used in Examples 10.1.5 –10.1.7 , we’ll consider only first order systems.
Numerical Solution of Systems
The numerical methods that we studied in Chapter 3 can be extended to systems, and most differential
equation software packages include programs to solve systems of equations. We won’t go into detail on
numerical methods for systems; however, for illustrative purposes we’ll describe the Runge-Kutta method
for the numerical solution of the initial value problem

y1 (t0 ) = y10 ,

ti = t0 + ih,
where

i = 0, 1, . . . , n,

BASIC THEORY OF HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS

In this section we consider homogeneous linear systems y0 = A(t)y, where A = A(t) is a continuous
n × n matrix function on an interval (a, b). The theory of linear homogeneous systems has much in
common with the theory of linear homogeneous scalar equations, which we considered in Sections 2.1,
5.1, and 9.1.
Whenever we refer to solutions of y0 = A(t)y we’ll mean solutions on (a, b). Since y ≡ 0 is obviously
a solution of y0 = A(t)y, we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is nontrivial.
If y1 , y2 , . . . , yn are vector functions defined on an interval (a, b) and c1 , c2 , . . . , cn are constants,
then
y = c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn
(10.3.1)

is a linear combination of y1 , y2 , . . . ,yn . It’s easy show that if y1 , y2 , . . . ,yn are solutions of y0 = A(t)y
on (a, b), then so is any linear combination of y1 , y2 , . . . , yn (Exercise 1). We say that {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn }
is a fundamental set of solutions of y0 = A(t)y on (a, b) on if every solution of y0 = A(t)y on (a, b) can
be written as a linear combination of y1 , y2 , . . . , yn , as in (10.3.1). In this case we say that (10.3.1) is
the general solution of y0 = A(t)y on (a, b).
It can be shown that if A is continuous on (a, b) then y0 = A(t)y has infinitely many fundamental sets
of solutions on (a, b) (Exercises 15 and 16). The next definition will help to characterize fundamental
sets of solutions of y0 = A(t)y.
We say that a set {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } of n-vector functions is linearly independent on (a, b) if the only
constants c1 , c2 , . . . , cn such that
c1 y1 (t) + c2 y2 (t) + · · · + cn yn (t) = 0,

a < t < b,

(10.3.2)

are c1 = c2 = · · · = cn = 0. If (10.3.2) holds for some set of constants c1 , c2 , . . . , cn that are not all
zero, then {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is linearly dependent on (a, b)
The next theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.1.3 and 9.1.2.

Theorem 10.3.1 Suppose the n×n matrix A = A(t) is continuous on (a, b). Then a set {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn }
of n solutions of y0 = A(t)y on (a, b) is a fundamental set if and only if it’s linearly independent on (a, b).

y0 = A(t)y for linear independence on an interval (a, b) on which A is continuous. To explain this (and
for other purposes later), it’s useful to write a linear combination of y1 , y2 , . . . , yn in a different way. We

analogous to definitions of the Wronskian of scalar functions given in Sections 5.1 and 9.1. The next
theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.1.4 and 9.1.3. The proof is sketched in Exercise 4 for n = 2 and in
Exercise 5 for general n.
Theorem 10.3.2 [Abel’s Formula] Suppose the n × n matrix A = A(t) is continuous on (a, b), let
y1 , y2 , . . . , yn be solutions of y0 = A(t)y on (a, b), and let t0 be in (a, b). Then the Wronskian of
{y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is given by

W (t) = W (t0 ) exp

Therefore, either W has no zeros in (a, b) or W ≡ 0 on (a, b).

R EMARK: The sum of the diagonal entries of a square matrix A is called the trace of A, denoted by
tr(A). Thus, for an n × n matrix A,
tr(A) = a11 + a22 + · · · + ann ,

The next theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.1.6 and 9.1.4.
Theorem 10.3.3 Suppose the n × n matrix A = A(t) is continuous on (a, b) and let y1 , y2 , . . . ,yn be
solutions of y0 = A(t)y on (a, b). Then the following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either
all true or all false:
(a) The general solution of y0 = A(t)y on (a, b) is y = c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn , where c1 , c2 , . . . ,
cn are arbitrary constants.

10.4

CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS I

We’ll now begin our study of the homogeneous system
y0 = Ay,

(10.4.1)

where A is an n × n constant matrix. Since A is continuous on (−∞, ∞), Theorem 10.2.1 implies that
all solutions of (10.4.1) are defined on (−∞, ∞). Therefore, when we speak of solutions of y0 = Ay,
we’ll mean solutions on (−∞, ∞).
In this section we assume that all the eigenvalues of A are real and that A has a set of n linearly
independent eigenvectors. In the next two sections we consider the cases where some of the eigenvalues
of A are complex, or where A does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors.
In Example 10.3.2 we showed that the vector functions

but we did not show how we obtained y1 and y2 in the first place. To see how these solutions can be
obtained we write (10.4.2) as
y10 = −4y1 − 3y2
(10.4.3)
y20 =
6y1 + 5y2
and look for solutions of the form
y1 = x1 eλt

and

y2 = x2 eλt ,

(10.4.4)

where x1 , x2 , and λ are constants to be determined. Differentiating (10.4.4) yields
y10 = λx1 eλt

and

y20 = λx2 eλt .

Substituting this and (10.4.4) into (10.4.3) and canceling the common factor eλt yields
−4x1 − 3x2
6x1 + 5x2

=
=

λx1
λx2 .

For a given λ, this is a homogeneous algebraic system, since it can be rewritten as
(−4 − λ)x1 − 3x2
6x1 + (5 − λ)x2

=

0.

(10.4.5)

The trivial solution x1 = x2 = 0 of this system isn’t useful, since it corresponds to the trivial solution
y1 ≡ y2 ≡ 0 of (10.4.3), which can’t be part of a fundamental set of solutions of (10.4.2). Therefore we
consider only those values of λ for which (10.4.5) has nontrivial solutions. These are the values of λ for
which the determinant of (10.4.5) is zero; that is,
−4 − λ
−3

5−λ

=

(−4 − λ)(5 − λ) + 18

=
=

λ2 − λ − 2
(λ − 2)(λ + 1) = 0,

which has the solutions λ1 = 2 and λ2 = −1.
Taking λ = 2 in (10.4.5) yields
−6x1 − 3x2
6x1 + 3x2

=
=

0
0,

which implies that x1 = −x2 /2, where x2 can be chosen arbitrarily. Choosing x2 = 2 yields the solution
y1 = −e2t , y2 = 2e2t of (10.4.3). We can write this solution in vector form as


−1
y1 =
e2t .

Taking λ = −1 in (10.4.5) yields the system

0,

so x1 = −x2 . Taking x2 = 1 here yields the solution y1 = −e−t , y2 = e−t of (10.4.3). We can write
this solution in vector form as



y2 =

In (10.4.6) and (10.4.7) the constant coefficients in the arguments of the exponential functions are the
eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix in (10.4.2), and the vector coefficients of the exponential functions
are associated eigenvectors. This illustrates the next theorem.

532 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
Theorem 10.4.1 Suppose the n×n constant matrix A has n real eigenvalues λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λn (which need
not be distinct) with associated linearly independent eigenvectors x1 , x2 , . . . , xn . Then the functions
y1 = x1 eλ1 t , y2 = x2 eλ2 t , . . . , yn = xn eλn t
form a fundamental set of solutions of y0 = Ay; that is, the general solution of this system is
y = c1 x1 eλ1 t + c2 x2 eλ2 t + · · · + cn xn eλn t .
Proof

Differentiating yi = xi eλi t and recalling that Axi = λi xi yields
yi0 = λi xi eλi t = Axi eλi t = Ayi .

This shows that yi is a solution of y0 = Ay.
The Wronskian of {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is

Since the columns of the determinant on the right are x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , which are assumed to be linearly
independent, the determinant is nonzero. Therefore Theorem 10.3.3 implies that {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } is a
fundamental set of solutions of y0 = Ay.

It is convenient

 to think of a “y1 -y2 plane," where a point is identified by rectangular coordinates (y1 , y2 ).
y1
If y =
is a non-constant solution of (10.4.18), then the point (y1 (t), y2 (t)) moves along a curve
y2
C in the y1 -y2 plane as t varies from −∞ to ∞. We call C the trajectory of y. (We also say that
C is a trajectory of the system (10.4.18).) I’s important to note that C is the trajectory of infinitely
many solutions of (10.4.18), since if τ is any real number, then y(t − τ ) is a solution of (10.4.18)
(Exercise 28(b)), and (y1 (t − τ ), y2 (t − τ )) also moves along C as t varies from −∞ to ∞. Moreover,
Exercise 28(c) implies that distinct trajectories of (10.4.18) can’t intersect, and that two solutions y1 and
y2 of (10.4.18) have the same trajectory if and only if y2 (t) = y1 (t − τ ) for some τ .
From Exercise 28(a), a trajectory of a nontrivial solution of (10.4.18) can’t contain
 (0, 0), which we
k1
define to be the trajectory of the trivial solution y ≡ 0. More generally, if y =
6= 0 is a constant
k2
solution of (10.4.18) (which could occur if zero is an eigenvalue of the matrix of (10.4.18)), we define the
trajectory of y to be the single point (k1 , k2 ).
To be specific, this is the question: What do the trajectories look like, and how are they traversed? In
this section we’ll answer this question, assuming that the matrix


a11 a12
A=
a21 a22
of (10.4.18) has real eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 with associated linearly independent eigenvectors x1 and x2 .
Then the general solution of (10.4.18) is
y = c1 x1 eλ1 t + c2 x2 eλ2 t .

(10.4.19)

We’ll consider other situations in the next two sections.
We leave it to you (Exercise 35) to classify the trajectories of (10.4.18) if zero is an eigenvalue of A.
We’ll confine our attention here to the case where both eigenvalues are nonzero. In this case the simplest
situation is where λ1 = λ2 6= 0, so (10.4.19) becomes
y = (c1 x1 + c2 x2 )eλ1 t .
Since x1 and x2 are linearly independent, an arbitrary vector x can be written as x = c1 x1 + c2 x2 .
Therefore the general solution of (10.4.18) can be written as y = xeλ1 t where x is an arbitrary 2vector, and the trajectories of nontrivial solutions of (10.4.18) are half-lines through (but not including)

538 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
the origin. The direction of motion is away from the origin if λ1 > 0 (Figure 10.4.1), toward it if λ1 < 0
(Figure 10.4.2). (In these and the next figures an arrow through a point indicates the direction of motion
along the trajectory through the point.)

Now suppose λ2 > λ1 , and let L1 and L2 denote lines through the origin parallel to x1 and x2 ,
respectively. By a half-line of L1 (or L2 ), we mean either of the rays obtained by removing the origin
from L1 (or L2 ).
Letting c2 = 0 in (10.4.19) yields y = c1 x1 eλ1 t . If c1 6= 0, the trajectory defined by this solution is a
half-line of L1 . The direction of motion is away from the origin if λ1 > 0, toward the origin if λ1 < 0.
Similarly, the trajectory of y = c2 x2 eλ2 t with c2 6= 0 is a half-line of L2 .
Henceforth, we assume that c1 and c2 in (10.4.19) are both nonzero. In this case, the trajectory of
(10.4.19) can’t intersect L1 or L2 , since every point on these lines is on the trajectory of a solution for
which either c1 = 0 or c2 = 0. (Remember: distinct trajectories can’t intersect!). Therefore the trajectory
of (10.4.19) must lie entirely in one of the four open sectors bounded by L1 and L2 , but do not any point
on L1 or L2 . Since the initial point (y1 (0), y2 (0)) defined by
y(0) = c1 x1 + c2 x2
is on the trajectory, we can determine which sector contains the trajectory from the signs of c1 and c2 , as
shown in Figure 10.4.3.
The direction of y(t) in (10.4.19) is the same as that of
e−λ2 t y(t) = c1 x1 e−(λ2 −λ1)t + c2 x2

(10.4.20)

e−λ1 t y(t) = c1 x1 + c2 x2 e(λ2 −λ1 )t .

(10.4.21)

and of
Since the right side of (10.4.20) approaches c2 x2 as t → ∞, the trajectory is asymptotically parallel to L2
as t → ∞. Since the right side of (10.4.21) approaches c1 x1 as t → −∞, the trajectory is asymptotically
parallel to L1 as t → −∞.
The shape and direction of traversal of the trajectory of (10.4.19) depend upon whether λ1 and λ2 are
both positive, both negative, or of opposite signs. We’ll now analyze these three cases.
Henceforth kuk denote the length of the vector u.

Case 1: λ2 > λ1 > 0
Figure 10.4.4 shows some typical trajectories. In this case, limt→−∞ ky(t)k = 0, so the trajectory is not
only asymptotically parallel to L1 as t → −∞, but is actually asymptotically tangent to L1 at the origin.

so, although the trajectory is asymptotically parallel to L2 as t → ∞, it’s not asymptotically tangent to

Case 2: 0 > λ2 > λ1
Figure 10.4.5 shows some typical trajectories. In this case, limt→∞ ky(t)k = 0, so the trajectory is
asymptotically tangent to L2 at the origin as t → ∞. On the other hand, limt→−∞ ky(t)k = ∞ and
lim

t→−∞

y(t) − c1 x1 eλ1 t = lim kc2 x2 eλ2 t k = ∞,

so, although the trajectory is asymptotically parallel to L1 as t → −∞, it’s not asymptotically tangent to
it. The direction of motion along each trajectory is toward the origin.
Case 3: λ2 > 0 > λ1
Figure 10.4.6 shows some typical trajectories. In this case,
lim ky(t)k = ∞ and

lim y(t) − c2 x2 eλ2 t = lim kc1 x1 eλ1 t k = 0,

so the trajectory is asymptotically tangent to L2 as t → ∞. Similarly,
lim ky(t)k = ∞ and

lim

y(t) − c1 x1 eλ1 t = lim kc2 x2 eλ2 t k = 0,

so the trajectory is asymptotically tangent to L1 as t → −∞. The direction of motion is toward the origin
on L1 and away from the origin on L2 . The direction of motion along any other trajectory is away from
L1 , toward L2 .

Q0 = bQ,

where α and β are positive constants. (Since negative population doesn’t make sense, this system
holds only while P and Q are both positive.) Now suppose P (0) = P0 > 0 and Q(0) = Q0 > 0.
(a) For several choices of a, b, α, and β, verify experimentally (by graphing trajectories of (A)
in the P -Q plane) that there’s a constant ρ > 0 (depending upon a, b, α, and β) with the
following properties:
(i) If Q0 > ρP0 , then P decreases monotonically to zero in finite time, during which Q
remains positive.
(ii) If Q0 < ρP0 , then Q decreases monotonically to zero in finite time, during which P

CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS II

We saw in Section 10.4 that if an n × n constant matrix A has n real eigenvalues λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λn (which
need not be distinct) with associated linearly independent eigenvectors x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , then the general
solution of y0 = Ay is
y = c1 x1 eλ1 t + c2 x2 eλ2 t + · · · + cn xn eλn t .

In this section we consider the case where A has n real eigenvalues, but does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors. It is shown in linear algebra that this occurs if and only if A has at least one eigenvalue
of multiplicity r > 1 such that the associated eigenspace has dimension less than r. In this case A is
said to be defective. Since it’s beyond the scope of this book to give a complete analysis of systems with
defective coefficient matrices, we will restrict our attention to some commonly occurring special cases.
Example 10.5.1 Show that the system

y

(10.5.1)

does not have a fundamental set of solutions of the form {x1 eλ1 t , x2 eλ2 t }, where λ1 and λ2 are eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix A of (10.5.1) and x1 , and x2 are associated linearly independent eigenvectors.
Solution The characteristic polynomial of A is

=

(λ − 11)(λ + 9) + 100

λ2 − 2λ + 1 = (λ − 1)2 .

From Example 10.5.1, we know that all scalar multiples of y1 =

however, to find the general solution we must find a second solution y2 such that {y1 , y2 } is linearly
independent. Based on your recollection of the procedure for solving a constant coefficient scalar equation
ay00 + by0 + cy = 0
in the case where the characteristic polynomial has a repeated root, you might expect toobtain

The next theorem shows what to do in this situation.
Theorem 10.5.1 Suppose the n×n matrix A has an eigenvalue λ1 of multiplicity ≥ 2 and the associated
eigenspace has dimension 1; that is, all λ1 -eigenvectors of A are scalar multiples of an eigenvector x.
Then there are infinitely many vectors u such that
(A − λ1 I)u = x.

(10.5.2)

Moreover, if u is any such vector then
y1 = xeλ1 t

and

y2 = ueλ1 t + xteλ1 t

(10.5.3)

are linearly independent solutions of y0 = Ay.
A complete proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this book. The difficulty is in proving that
there’s a vector u satisfying (10.5.2), since det(A − λ1 I) = 0. We’ll take this without proof and verify
the other assertions of the theorem.
We already know that y1 in (10.5.3) is a solution of y0 = Ay. To see that y2 is also a solution, we
compute
y20 − Ay2

=
=

λ1 ueλ1 t + xeλ1 t + λ1 xteλ1 t − Aueλ1 t − Axteλ1 t
(λ1 u + x − Au)eλ1 t + (λ1 x − Ax)teλ1 t .

Since Ax = λ1 x, this can be written as
y20 − Ay2 = − ((A − λ1 I)u − x) eλ1 t ,
and now (10.5.2) implies that y20 = Ay2 .

Section 10.5 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Systems II

To see that y1 and y2 are linearly independent, suppose c1 and c2 are constants such that
c1 y1 + c2 y2 = c1 xeλ1 t + c2 (ueλ1 t + xteλ1 t ) = 0.

(10.5.4)

We must show that c1 = c2 = 0. Multiplying (10.5.4) by e−λ1 t shows that
c1 x + c2 (u + xt) = 0.

(10.5.5)

By differentiating this with respect to t, we see that c2 x = 0, which implies c2 = 0, because x 6= 0.
Substituting c2 = 0 into (10.5.5) yields c1 x = 0, which implies that c1 = 0, again because x 6= 0

Henceforth, we assume that c2 6= 0. In this case, the trajectory of (10.5.20) can’t intersect L, since
every point of L is on a trajectory obtained by setting c2 = 0. Therefore the trajectory of (10.5.20) must
lie entirely in one of the open half-planes bounded by L, but does not contain any point on L. Since the
initial point (y1 (0), y2 (0)) defined by y(0) = c1 x1 + c2 u is on the trajectory, we can determine which
half-plane contains the trajectory from the sign of c2 , as shown in Figure 552. For convenience we’ll call
the half-plane where c2 > 0 the positive half-plane. Similarly, the-half plane where c2 < 0 is the negative
half-plane. You should convince yourself (Exercise 35) that even though there are infinitely many vectors
u that satisfy (10.5.21), they all define the same positive and negative half-planes. In the figures simply
regard u as an arrow pointing to the positive half-plane, since wen’t attempted to give u its proper length
or direction in comparison with x. For our purposes here, only the relative orientation of x and u is
important; that is, whether the positive half-plane is to the right of an observer facing the direction of x
(as in Figures 10.5.2 and 10.5.5), or to the left of the observer (as in Figures 10.5.3 and 10.5.4).
Multiplying (10.5.20) by e−λ1 t yields
e−λ1 t y(t) = c1 x + c2 u + c2 tx.
Since the last term on the right is dominant when |t| is large, this provides the following information on
the direction of y(t):
(a) Along trajectories in the positive half-plane (c2 > 0), the direction of y(t) approaches the direction
of x as t → ∞ and the direction of −x as t → −∞.

(b) Along trajectories in the negative half-plane (c2 < 0), the direction of y(t) approaches the direction
of −x as t → ∞ and the direction of x as t → −∞.

λ1 > 0,

or

t→∞

there are four possible patterns for the trajectories of (10.5.19), depending upon the signs of c2 and λ1 .
Figures 10.5.2-10.5.5 illustrate these patterns, and reveal the following principle:
If λ1 and c2 have the same sign then the direction of the traectory approaches the direction of −x as
kyk → 0 and the direction of x as kyk → ∞. If λ1 and c2 have opposite signs then the direction of the
trajectory approaches the direction of x as kyk → 0 and the direction of −x as kyk → ∞.

CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS III

We now consider the system y0 = Ay, where A has a complex eigenvalue λ = α + iβ with β 6= 0.
We continue to assume that A has real entries, so the characteristic polynomial of A has real coefficients.
This implies that λ = α − iβ is also an eigenvalue of A.
An eigenvector x of A associated with λ = α + iβ will have complex entries, so we’ll write
x = u + iv
where u and v have real entries; that is, u and v are the real and imaginary parts of x. Since Ax = λx,
A(u + iv) = (α + iβ)(u + iv).

(10.6.1)

Taking complex conjugates here and recalling that A has real entries yields
A(u − iv) = (α − iβ)(u − iv),
which shows that x = u − iv is an eigenvector associated with λ = α − iβ. The complex conjugate
eigenvalues λ and λ can be separately associated with linearly independent solutions y0 = Ay; however,
we won’t pursue this approach, since solutions obtained in this way turn out to be complex–valued.
Instead, we’ll obtain solutions of y0 = Ay in the form
y = f1 u + f2 v
where f1 and f2 are real–valued scalar functions. The next theorem shows how to do this.

(10.6.2)

558 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
Theorem 10.6.1 Let A be an n × n matrix with real entries. Let λ = α + iβ (β 6= 0) be a complex
eigenvalue of A and let x = u + iv be an associated eigenvector, where u and v have real components.
Then u and v are both nonzero and
y1 = eαt (u cos βt − v sin βt)

and y2 = eαt (u sin βt + v cos βt),

which are the real and imaginary parts of
eαt (cos βt + i sin βt)(u + iv),

(10.6.3)

are linearly independent solutions of y0 = Ay.
Proof

A function of the form (10.6.2) is a solution of y0 = Ay if and only if
f10 u + f20 v = f1 Au + f2 Av.

(10.6.4)

Carrying out the multiplication indicated on the right side of (10.6.1) and collecting the real and imaginary
parts of the result yields
A(u + iv) = (αu − βv) + i(αv + βu).
Equating real and imaginary parts on the two sides of this equation yields
Au
Av

= αu − βv
= αv + βu.

We leave it to you (Exercise 25) to show from this that u and v are both nonzero. Substituting from these
equations into (10.6.4) yields
f10 u + f20 v

=
=

f1 (αu − βv) + f2 (αv + βu)
(αf1 + βf2 )u + (−βf1 + αf2 )v.

This is true if
f10
f20

=
=

αf1 + βf2
−βf1 + αf2 ,

or, equivalently,

f10 − αf1
f20 − αf2

=
=

βf2
−βf1 .

If we let f1 = g1 eαt and f2 = g2 eαt , where g1 and g2 are to be determined, then the last two equations
become
g10 =
βg2
g20 = −βg1 ,
which implies that
g100 = βg20 = −β 2 g1 ,
so
g100 + β 2 g1 = 0.
The general solution of this equation is
g1 = c1 cos βt + c2 sin βt.
Moreover, since g2 = g10 /β,
g2 = −c1 sin βt + c2 cos βt.

Section 10.6 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Systems III

559

Multiplying g1 and g2 by eαt shows that
f1

=

eαt ( c1 cos βt + c2 sin βt),

f2

=

eαt (−c1 sin βt + c2 cos βt).

Substituting these into (10.6.2) shows that
eαt [(c1 cos βt + c2 sin βt)u + (−c1 sin βt + c2 cos βt)v]
c1 eαt (u cos βt − v sin βt) + c2 eαt (u sin βt + v cos βt)

(10.6.5)

is a solution of y0 = Ay for any choice of the constants c1 and c2 . In particular, by first taking c1 = 1
and c2 = 0 and then taking c1 = 0 and c2 = 1, we see that y1 and y2 are solutions of y0 = Ay. We leave
it to you to verify that they are, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of (10.6.3) (Exercise 26), and
that they are linearly independent (Exercise 27).

has a complex eigenvalue λ = α + iβ (β 6= 0) and x = u + iv is an associated eigenvector, where
u and v have real components. To describe the trajectories accurately it’s necessary to introduce a new
rectangular coordinate system in the y1 -y2 plane. This raises a point that hasn’t come up before: It is
always possible to choose x so that (u, v) = 0. A special effort is required to do this, since not every
eigenvector has this property. However, if we know an eigenvector that doesn’t, we can multiply it by a
suitable complex constant to obtain one that does. To see this, note that if x is a λ-eigenvector of A and
k is an arbitrary real number, then
x1 = (1 + ik)x = (1 + ik)(u + iv) = (u − kv) + i(v + ku)

564 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
is also a λ-eigenvector of A, since
Ax1 = A((1 + ik)x) = (1 + ik)Ax = (1 + ik)λx = λ((1 + ik)x) = λx1 .
The real and imaginary parts of x1 are
u1 = u − kv

and

v1 = v + ku,

(10.6.11)

so


(u1 , v1 ) = (u − kv, v + ku) = − (u, v)k 2 + (kvk2 − kuk2)k − (u, v) .

Therefore (u1 , v1 ) = 0 if

(u, v)k 2 + (kvk2 − kuk2 )k − (u, v) = 0.

(10.6.12)

If (u, v) 6= 0 we can use the quadratic formula to find two real values of k such that (u1 , v1 ) = 0
(Exercise 28).

(The numbers don’t always work out as nicely as in this example. You’ll need a calculator or computer
to do Exercises 29-40.)
Henceforth, we’ll assume that (u, v) = 0. Let U and V be unit vectors in the directions of u and v,
respectively; that is, U = u/kuk and V = v/kvk. The new rectangular coordinate system will have the
same origin as the y1 -y2 system. The coordinates of a point in this system will be denoted by (z1 , z2 ),
where z1 and z2 are the displacements in the directions of U and V, respectively.
From (10.6.5), the solutions of (10.6.10) are given by
y = eαt [(c1 cos βt + c2 sin βt)u + (−c1 sin βt + c2 cos βt)v] .

(10.6.13)

For convenience, let’s call the curve traversed by e−αt y(t) a shadow trajectory of (10.6.10). Multiplying
(10.6.13) by e−αt yields
e−αt y(t) = z1 (t)U + z2 (t)V,

If α = 0, then any trajectory of (10.6.10) is a shadow trajectory of (10.6.10); therefore, if λ is
purely imaginary, then the trajectories of (10.6.10) are ellipses traversed periodically as indicated in Figures 10.6.1 and 10.6.2.
If α > 0, then
lim ky(t)k = ∞ and
lim y(t) = 0,

so the trajectory spirals away from the origin as t varies from −∞ to ∞. The direction of the spiral
depends upon the relative orientation of U and V, as shown in Figures 10.6.3 and 10.6.4.
If α < 0, then
lim ky(t)k = ∞ and

so the trajectory spirals toward the origin as t varies from −∞ to ∞. Again, the direction of the spiral

VARIATION OF PARAMETERS FOR NONHOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS

We now consider the nonhomogeneous linear system
y0 = A(t)y + f (t),
where A is an n × n matrix function and f is an n-vector forcing function. Associated with this system is
the complementary system y0 = A(t)y.
The next theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.3.2 and 9.1.5. It shows how to find the general solution
of y0 = A(t)y + f (t) if we know a particular solution of y0 = A(t)y + f (t) and a fundamental set of
solutions of the complementary system. We leave the proof as an exercise (Exercise 21).
Theorem 10.7.1 Suppose the n × n matrix function A and the n-vector function f are continuous on
(a, b). Let yp be a particular solution of y0 = A(t)y + f (t) on (a, b), and let {y1 , y2 , . . . , yn } be a
fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation y0 = A(t)y on (a, b). Then y is a solution
of y0 = A(t)y + f (t) on (a, b) if and only if
y = yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 + · · · + cn yn ,
where c1 , c2 , . . . , cn are constants.
Finding a Particular Solution of a Nonhomogeneous System
We now discuss an extension of the method of variation of parameters to linear nonhomogeneous systems.
This method will produce a particular solution of a nonhomogenous system y0 = A(t)y + f (t) provided
that we know a fundamental matrix for the complementary system. To derive the method, suppose Y is a
fundamental matrix for the complementary system; that is,

is a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary system. In Section 10.3 we saw that Y 0 = A(t)Y .
We seek a particular solution of
y0 = A(t)y + f (t)
(10.7.1)
of the form
yp = Y u,

(10.7.2)

570 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
where u is to be determined. Differentiating (10.7.2) yields
yp0

= Y 0 u + Y u0
= AY u + Y u0 (since Y 0 = AY )
= Ayp + Y u0 (since Y u = yp ).

Comparing this with (10.7.1) shows that yp = Y u is a solution of (10.7.1) if and only if
Y u0 = f .
Thus, we can find a particular solution yp by solving this equation for u0 , integrating to obtain u, and
computing Y u. We can take all constants of integration to be zero, since any particular solution will
suffice.
Exercise 22 sketches a proof that this method is analogous to the method of variation of parameters
discussed in Sections 5.7 and 9.4 for scalar linear equations.

Boundary Value Problems and Fourier
Expansions

IN THIS CHAPTER we develop series representations of functions that will be used to solve partial
differential equations in Chapter 12.
SECTION 11.1 deals with five boundary value problems for the differential equation
y00 + λy = 0.
They are related to problems in partial differential equations that will be discussed in Chapter 12. We
define what is meant by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the boundary value problems, and show that
the eigenfunctions have a property called orthogonality.
SECTION 11.2 introduces Fourier series, which are expansions of given functions in term of sines and
cosines.
SECTION 11.3 deals with expansions of functions in terms of the eigenfunctions of four of the eigenvalue
problems discussed in Section 11.1. They are all related to the Fourier series discussed in Section 11.2.

Section 11.1 Eigenvalue Problems for y00 + λy = 0

EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS FOR y00 + λy = 0

In Chapter 12 we’ll study partial differential equations that arise in problems of heat conduction, wave
propagation, and potential theory. The purpose of this chapter is to develop tools required to solve these
equations. In this section we consider the following problems, where λ is a real number and L > 0:
Problem 1:
y00 + λy = 0, y(0) = 0, y(L) = 0
Problem 2:

y00 + λy = 0,

y0 (0) = 0,

y0 (L) = 0

Problem 3:

y00 + λy = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y0 (L) = 0

Problem 4:

y00 + λy = 0,

y0 (0) = 0,

y(L) = 0

Problem 5:

y00 + λy = 0,

y(−L) = y(L),

y0 (−L) = y0 (L)

In each problem the conditions following the differential equation are called boundary conditions. Note
that the boundary conditions in Problem 5, unlike those in Problems 1-4, don’t require that y or y0 be zero
at the boundary points, but only that y have the same value at x = ±L , and that y0 have the same value
at x = ±L. We say that the boundary conditions in Problem 5 are periodic.
Obviously, y ≡ 0 (the trivial solution) is a solution of Problems 1-5 for any value of λ. For most values
of λ, there are no other solutions. The interesting question is this:
For what values of λ does the problem have nontrivial solutions, and what are they?
A value of λ for which the problem has a nontrivial solution is an eigenvalue of the problem, and
the nontrivial solutions are λ-eigenfunctions, or eigenfunctions associated with λ. Note that a nonzero
constant multiple of a λ-eigenfunction is again a λ-eigenfunction.
Problems 1-5 are called eigenvalue problems. Solving an eigenvalue problem means finding all its
eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions. We’ll take it as given here that all the eigenvalues of Problems 1-5 are real numbers. This is proved in a more general setting in Section 13.2.
Theorem 11.1.1 Problems 1–5 have no negative eigenvalues. Moreover, λ = 0 is an eigenvalue of
Problems 2 and 5, with associated eigenfunction y0 = 1, but λ = 0 isn’t an eigenvalue of Problems 1, 3,
or 4.
Proof We consider Problems 1-4, and leave Problem 5 to you (Exercise 1). If y00 + λy = 0, then
y(y00 + λy) = 0, so
Z L
y(x)(y00 (x) + λy(x)) dx = 0;

However, if y satisfies any of the boundary conditions of Problems 1-4, then
y(L)y0 (L) − y(0)y0 (0) = 0;

RL

If y 6≡ 0, then 0 y2 (x) dx > 0. Therefore λ ≥ 0 and, if λ = 0, then y0 (x) = 0 for all x in (0, L) (why?),
and y is constant on (0, L). Any constant function satisfies the boundary conditions of Problem 2, so
λ = 0 is an eigenvalue of Problem 2 and any nonzero constant function is an associated eigenfunction.
However, the only constant function that satisfies the boundary conditions of Problems 1, 3, or 4 is y ≡ 0.
Therefore λ = 0 isn’t an eigenvalue of any of these problems.
Example 11.1.1 (Problem 1) Solve the eigenvalue problem
y00 + λy = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y(L) = 0.

(11.1.3)

Solution From Theorem 11.1.1, any eigenvalues of (11.1.3) must be positive. If y satisfies (11.1.3) with
λ > 0, then
√
√
y = c1 cos λ x + c2 sin λ x,
where c1 and
√ c2 are constants. The boundary condition y(0) = 0 implies that
√ c1 = 0. Therefore
y = c√2 sin λ x. Now the boundary condition√y(L) = 0 implies that c2 sin λ L = 0. To make
c2 sin λ L = 0 with c2 6= 0, we must choose λ = nπ/L, where n is a positive integer. Therefore
λn = n2 π 2 /L2 is an eigenvalue and
nπx
yn = sin
L
is an associated eigenfunction.
For future reference, we state the result of Example 11.1.1 as a theorem.
Theorem 11.1.2 The eigenvalue problem
y00 + λy = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y(L) = 0

has infinitely many positive eigenvalues λn = n2 π 2 /L2 , with associated eigenfunctions
yn = sin

nπx
,
L

n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..

There are no other eigenvalues.
We leave it to you to prove the next theorem about Problem 2 by an argument like that of Example 11.1.1 (Exercise 17).
Theorem 11.1.3 The eigenvalue problem
y00 + λy = 0,

y0 (0) = 0,

y0 (L) = 0

λn = n2 π 2 /L2 , with associated eigenfunctions

There are no other eigenvalues.

Example 11.1.2 (Problem 3) Solve the eigenvalue problem
y00 + λy = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y0 (L) = 0.

(11.1.4)

Solution From Theorem 11.1.1, any eigenvalues of (11.1.4) must be positive. If y satisfies (11.1.4) with
λ > 0, then
√
√
y = c1 cos λ x + c2 sin λ x,
where c1 and
√ c2 are constants. The√ boundary

Hence,

Solution From Theorem 11.1.1, λ = 0 is an eigenvalue of (11.1.5) with associated eigenfunction y0 = 1,

11.2 FOURIER EXPANSIONS I
In Example 11.1.4 and Exercises 11.1.4–11.1.22 we saw that the eigenfunctions of Problem 5 are orthogonal on [−L, L] and the eigenfunctions of Problems 1–4 are orthogonal on [0, L]. In this section and the
next we introduce some series expansions in terms of these eigenfunctions. We’ll use these expansions to
solve partial differential equations in Chapter 12.
Theorem 11.2.1 Suppose the functions φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , . . . , are orthogonal on [a, b] and
Z b

for some constant M < ∞. Suppose also that the series

It can be shown that the boundedness of the partial sums {fN }∞

interchange the operations of integration and summation on the right of (11.2.4), and rewrite (11.2.4) as

(11.2.7)

You may wonder why we don’t write

n=1

rather than (11.2.7). Unfortunately, this isn’t always true. The series on the right may diverge for some or
all values of x in [a, b], or it may converge to f(x) for some values of x and not for others. So, for now,
we’ll just think of the series as being associated with f because of the definition of the coefficients {cn },
and we’ll indicate this association informally as in (11.2.7).

Convergence of Fourier Series
The question of convergence of Fourier series for arbitrary integrable functions is beyond the scope of
this book. However, we can state a theorem that settles this question for most functions that arise in
applications.
Definition 11.2.3 A function f is said to be piecewise smooth on [a, b] if:
(a) f has at most finitely many points of discontinuity in (a, b);
(b) f 0 exists and is continuous except possibly at finitely many points in (a, b);
(c) f(x0 +) = limx→x0 + f(x) and f 0 (x0 +) = limx→x0 + f 0 (x) exist if a ≤ x0 < b;

(d) f(x0 −) = limx→x0 − f(x) and f 0 (x0 −) = limx→x0 − f 0 (x) exist if a < x0 ≤ b.

Since f and f 0 are required to be continuous at all but finitely many points in [a, b], f(x0 +) = f(x0 −)
and f 0 (x0 +) = f 0 (x0 −) for all but finitely many values of x0 in (a, b). Recall from Section 8.1 that f is
said to have a jump discontinuity at x0 if f(x0 +) 6= f(x0 −).
The next theorem gives sufficient conditions for convergence of a Fourier series. The proof is beyond
the scope of this book.

Since f(x+) = f(x−) if f is continuous at x, we can also say that


 f(x+) + f(x−)
if − L < x < L,
2
F (x) =

 f(L−) + f(−L+) if x = ±L.
2

Note that F is itself piecewise smooth on [−L, L], and F (x) = f(x) at all points in the open interval
(−L, L) where f is continuous. Since the series in (11.2.8) converges to F (x) for all x in [−L, L], you
may be tempted to infer that the error

X

can be made as small as we please for all x in [−L, L] by choosing N sufficiently large. However, this
isn’t true if f has a discontinuity somewhere in (−L, L), or if f(−L+) 6= f(L−). Here’s the situation in
this case.
If f has a jump discontinuity at a point α in (−L, L), there will be sequences of points {uN } and {vN }
in (−L, α) and (α, L), respectively, such that
lim uN = lim vN = α

N→∞

N→∞

and
EN (uN ) ≈ .09|f(α−) − f(α+)|

and

EN (vN ) ≈ .09|f(α−) − f(α+)|.

Thus, the maximum value of the error EN (x) near α does not approach zero as N → ∞, but just occurs
closer and closer to (and on both sides of ) α, and is essentially independent of N .
If f(−L+) 6= f(L−), then there will be sequences of points {uN } and {vN } in (−L, L) such that
lim uN = −L,

N→∞

EN (uN ) ≈ .09|f(−L+) − f(L−)|

and

lim vN = L,

N→∞

EN (vN ) ≈ .09|f(−L+) − f(L−)|.

This is the Gibbs phenomenon. Having been alerted to it, you may see it in Figures 11.2.2–11.2.4,
below; however, we’ll give a specific example at the end of this section.

Even and Odd Functions
Computing the Fourier coefficients of a function f can be tedious; however, the computation can often be
simplified by exploiting symmetries in f or some of its terms. To focus on this, we recall some concepts
that you studied in calculus. Let u and v be defined on [−L, L] and suppose that
u(−x) = u(x)

v(−x) = −v(x),

and

−L ≤ x ≤ L.

Then we say that u is an even function and v is an odd function. Note that:
• The product of two even functions is even.
• The product of two odd functions is even.
• The product of an even function and an odd function is odd.
Example 11.2.2 The functions u(x) = cos ωx and u(x) = x2 are even, while v(x) = sin ωx and
v(x) = x3 are odd. The function w(x) = ex is neither even nor odd.
You learned parts (a) and (b) of the next theorem in calculus, and the other parts follow from them
(Exercise 1).

USING TECHNOLOGY
The computation of Fourier coefficients will be tedious in many of the exercises in this chapter and
the next. To learn the technique, we recommend that you do some exercises in each section “by hand,”
perhaps using the table of integrals at the front of the book. However, we encourage you to use your
favorite symbolic computation software in the more difficult problems.

We’ll call this expansion the mixed Fourier cosine series of f on [0, L], because the boundary conditions of (11.3.2) are “mixed” in that they require y to be zero at one boundary point and y0 to be zero at the
other. By contrast, the “ordinary” Fourier cosine series is associated with (11.3.1), where the boundary
conditions require that y0 be zero at both endpoints.
It can be shown (Exercise 57) that the mixed Fourier cosine series of f on [0, L] is simply the restriction
to [0, L] of the Fourier cosine series of


A Useful Observation
In applications involving expansions in terms of the eigenfunctions of Problems 1-4, the functions being
expanded are often polynomials that satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem under consideration.
In this case the next theorem presents an efficient way to obtain the coefficients in the expansion.
Theorem 11.3.5
(a) If f 0 (0) = f 0 (L) = 0, f 00 is continuous, and f 000 is piecewise continuous on [0, L], then
f(x) = a0 +

[0, L], Theorem 11.3.1 implies (11.3.3) with a0 , a1 , a2 ,... as defined in Theorem 11.3.1. We already know
that a0 is as in (11.3.4). If n ≥ 1, integrating twice by parts yields

(By an argument similar to one used in the proof of Theorem 8.3.1, the last integration by parts is legitimate in the case where f 000 is undefined at finitely many points in [0, L], so long as it’s piecewise
continuous on [0, L].) This completes the proof.

Fourier Solutions of Partial Differential

IN THIS CHAPTER we use the series discussed in Chapter 11 to solve partial differential equations that
arise in problems of mathematical physics.
SECTION 12.1 deals with the partial differential equation
ut = a2 uxx ,
which arises in problems of conduction of heat.
SECTION 12.2 deals with the partial differential equation
utt = a2 uxx ,
which arises in the problem of the vibrating string.
SECTION 12.3 deals with the partial differential equation
uxx + uyy = 0,
which arises in steady state problems of heat conduction and potential theory.
SECTION 12.4 deals with the partial differential equation

THE HEAT EQUATION

We begin the study of partial differential equations with the problem of heat flow in a uniform bar of
length L, situated on the x axis with one end at the origin and the other at x = L (Figure 12.1.1).
We assume that the bar is perfectly insulated except possibly at its endpoints, and that the temperature
is constant on each cross section and therefore depends only on x and t. We also assume that the thermal
properties of the bar are independent of x and t. In this case, it can be shown that the temperature
u = u(x, t) at time t at a point x units from the origin satisfies the partial differential equation
ut = a2 uxx,

0 < x < L,

t > 0,

where a is a positive constant determined by the thermal properties. This is the heat equation.

x
x=0

x=L

Figure 12.1.1 A uniform bar of length L
To determine u, we must specify the temperature at every point in the bar when t = 0, say
u(x, 0) = f(x),

0 ≤ x ≤ L.

We call this the initial condition. We must also specify boundary conditions that u must satisfy at the
ends of the bar for all t > 0. We’ll call this problem an initial-boundary value problem.
We begin with the boundary conditions u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0, and write the initial-boundary value
problem as
ut = a2 uxx, 0 < x < L, t > 0,
u(0, t) = 0, u(L, t) = 0, t > 0,
(12.1.1)
u(x, 0) = f(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L.
Our method of solving this problem is called separation of variables (not to be confused with method
of separation of variables used in Section 2.2 for solving ordinary differential equations). We begin by
looking for functions of the form
v(x, t) = X(x)T (t)
that are not identically zero and satisfy
vt = a2 vxx ,

v(0, t) = 0,

v(L, t) = 0

620 Chapter 12 Fourier Solutions of Partial Differential
for all (x, t). Since
vt = XT 0
vt = a2 vxx if and only if

vxx = X 00 T,

and

XT 0 = a2 X 00 T,

which we rewrite as

T0
X 00
=
.
a2 T
X
Since the expression on the left is independent of x while the one on the right is independent of t, this
equation can hold for all (x, t) only if the two sides equal the same constant, which we call a separation
constant, and write it as −λ; thus,
T0
X 00
= 2 = −λ.
X
a T
This is equivalent to
X 00 + λX = 0
and
T 0 = −a2 λT.

(12.1.2)

Since v(0, t) = X(0)T (t) = 0 and v(L, t) = X(L)T (t) = 0 and we don’t want T to be identically zero,
X(0) = 0 and X(L) = 0. Therefore λ must be an eigenvalue of the boundary value problem
X 00 + λX = 0,

X(0) = 0,

X(L) = 0,

(12.1.3)

and X must be a λ-eigenfunction. From Theorem 11.1.2, the eigenvalues of (12.1.3) are λn = n2 π 2 /L2 ,
with associated eigenfunctions
Xn = sin

nπx

L

n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..

Substituting λ = n2 π 2 /L2 into (12.1.2) yields
T 0 = −(n2 π 2 a2 /L2 )T,
which has the solution

We use the term “formal solution” in this definition because it’s not in general true that the infinite
series in (12.1.5) actually satisfies all the requirements of the initial-boundary value problem (12.1.4)
when it does, we say that it’s an actual solution of (12.1.4).
Because of the negative exponentials in (12.1.5), u converges for all (x, t) with t > 0 (Exercise 54).
Since each term in (12.1.5) satisfies the heat equation and the boundary conditions in (12.1.4), u also has
these properties if ut and uxx can be obtained by differentiating the series in (12.1.5) term by term once
with respect to t and twice with respect to x, for t > 0. However, it’s not always legitimate to differentiate
an infinite series term by term. The next theorem gives a useful sufficient condition for legitimacy of term
by term differentiation of an infinite series. We omit the proof.
Theorem 12.1.2 A convergent infinite series
W (z) =

W 0 (z) =

(where the derivatives at z = z1 and z = z2 are one-sided) provided that wn0 is continuous on [z1 , z2 ]
and
|wn0 (z)| ≤ Mn , z1 ≤ z ≤ z2 , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
P∞
where M1 , M2 , . . . , Mn , . . . , are constants such that the series n=1 Mn converges.

Theorem 12.1.2, applied twice with z = x and once with z = t, shows that uxx and ut can be obtained
by differentiating u term by term if t > 0 (Exercise 54). Therefore u satisfies the heat equation and the
boundary conditions in (12.1.4) for t > 0. Therefore, since u(x, 0) = S(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ L, u is an actual
solution of (12.1.4) if and only if S(x) = f(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ L. From Theorem 11.3.2, this is true if f is
continuous and piecewise smooth on [0, L], and f(0) = f(L) = 0.
In this chapter we’ll define formal solutions of several kinds of problems. When we ask you to solve
such problems, we always mean that you should find a formal solution.

Nonhomogeneous Problems
A problem of the form
ut = a2 uxx + h(x), 0 < x < L, t > 0,
u(0, t) = u0 , u(L, t) = uL , t > 0,
u(x, 0) = f(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L

(12.1.9)

can be transformed to a problem that can be solved by separation of variables. We write
u(x, t) = v(x, t) + q(x),
where q is to be determined. Then
ut = vt

and

uxx = vxx + q 00

(12.1.10)

Section 12.1 The Heat Equation

625

so u satisfies (12.1.9) if v satisfies
vt = a2 vxx + a2 q 00 (x) + h(x), 0 < x < L, t > 0,
v(0, t) = u0 − q(0), v(L, t) = uL − q(L), t > 0,
v(x, 0) = f(x) − q(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L.
This reduces to

vt = a2 vxx , 0 < x < L, t > 0,
v(0, t) = 0, v(L, t) = 0, t > 0,
v(x, 0) = f(x) − q(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L

(12.1.11)

if
a2 q 00 + h(x) = 0,

q(0) = u0 ,

q(L) = uL .

We can obtain q by integrating q 00 = −h/a2 twice and choosing the constants of integration so that
q(0) = u0 and q(L) = uL . Then we can solve (12.1.11) for v by separation of variables, and (12.1.10) is
the solution of (12.1.9).
Example 12.1.5 Solve
ut = uxx − 2, 0 < x < 1, t > 0,
u(0, t) = −1, u(1, t) = 1, t > 0,
u(x, 0) = x3 − 2x2 + 3x − 1, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
Solution We leave it to you to show that
q(x) = x2 + x − 1
satisfies
q 00 − 2 = 0,

q(0) = −1,

q(1) = 1.

Therefore
u(x, t) = v(x, t) + x2 + x − 1,
where
vt = vxx ,
v(0, t) = 0,

0 < x < 1,
v(1, t) = 0,

t > 0,
t > 0,

and
v(x, 0) = x3 − 2x2 + 3x − 1 − x2 − x + 1 = x(x2 − 3x + 2).
From Example 12.1.1 with a = 1 and L = 1,
v(x, t) =

12 X 1 −n2 π2 t

Therefore
u(x, t) = x2 + x − 1 +

A similar procedure works if the boundary conditions in (12.1.11) are replaced by mixed boundary
conditions
ux(0, t) = u0 , u(L, t) = uL, t > 0

626 Chapter 12 Fourier Solutions of Partial Differential
or
u(0, t) = u0 ,

ux(L, t) = uL,

t > 0;

(12.1.12)

For several fixed values of t (including t = 0), graph um (x, t) versus t. In some cases it may be useful to
graph the curves corresponding to the various values of t on the same axes in other cases you may want to
graph the various curves sucessively (for increasing values of t), and create a primitive motion picture on
your monitor. Repeat this experiment for several values of m, to compare how the results depend upon
m for small and large values of t. However, keep in mind that the meanings of “small” and “large” in this
case depend upon the constants a2 and L2 . A good way to handle this is to rewrite (12.1.12) as
um (x, t) =

12.2 THE WAVE EQUATION
In this section we consider initial-boundary value problems of the form
utt = a2 uxx , 0 < x < L, t > 0,
u(0, t) = 0, u(L, t) = 0, t > 0,
u(x, 0) = f(x), ut (x, 0) = g(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L,

(12.2.1)

where a is a constant and f and g are given functions of x.
The partial differential equation utt = a2 uxx is called the wave equation. It is necessary to specify
both f and g because the wave equation is a second order equation in t for each fixed x.
This equation and its generalizations
utt = a2 (uxx + uyy )

and

utt = a2 (uxx + uyy + uzz )

to two and three space dimensions have important applications to the the propagation of electromagnetic,
sonic, and water waves.
The Vibrating String
We motivate the study of the wave equation by considering its application to the vibrations of a string –
such as a violin string – tightly stretched in equilibrium along the x-axis in the xu-plane and tied to the
points (0, 0) and (L, 0) (Figure 12.2.1).
If the string is plucked in the vertical direction and released at time t = 0, it will oscillate in the xuplane. Let u(x, t) denote the displacement of the point on the string above (or below) the abscissa x at
time t.
We’ll show that it’s reasonable to assume that u satisfies the wave equation under the following assumptions:

Figure 12.2.1 A stretched string
1. The mass density (mass per unit length) ρ of the string is constant throughout the string.
2. The tension T induced by tightly stretching the string along the x-axis is so great that all other
forces, such as gravity and air resistance, can be neglected.
3. The tension at any point on the string acts along the tangent to the string at that point, and the
magnitude of its horizontal component is always equal to T , the tension in the string in equilibrium.
4. The slope of the string at every point remains sufficiently small so that we can make the approximation
p
1 + u2x ≈ 1.
(12.2.2)

Figure 12.2.2 shows a segment of the displaced string at a time t > 0. (Don’t think that the figure is
necessarily inconsistent with Assumption 4; we exaggerated the slope for clarity.)
The vectors T1 and T2 are the forces due to tension, acting along the tangents to the segment at its
endpoints. From Newton’s second law of motion, T1 − T2 is equal to the mass times the acceleration of
the center of mass of the segment. The horizontal and vertical components of T1 − T2 are
|T2 | cos θ2 − |T1 | cos θ1

and

|T2 | sin θ2 − |T1 | sin θ1 ,

respectively. Since
|T2 | cos θ2 = |T1 | cos θ1 = T

(12.2.3)

by assumption, the net horizontal force is zero, so there’s no horizontal acceleration. Since the initial
horizontal velocity is zero, there’s no horizontal motion.
Applying Newton’s second law of motion in the vertical direction yields
|T2 | sin θ2 − |T1 | sin θ1 = ρ∆s utt (x, t),

Letting ∆x → 0 yields

which we rewrite as utt = a2 uxx, with a2 = T /ρ.
The Formal Solution
As in Section 12.1, we use separation of variables to obtain a suitable definition for the formal solution of
(12.2.1). We begin by looking for functions of the form v(x, t) = X(x)T (t) that are not identically zero
and satisfy
vtt = a2 vxx , v(0, t) = 0, v(L, t) = 0
for all (x, t). Since
vtt = XT 00
vtt = a2 vxx if and only if

and

vxx = X 00 T,

XT 00 = a2 X 00 T,

which we rewrite as

T 00
X 00
=
.

a T
X
For this to hold for all (x, t), the two sides must equal the same constant; thus,
X 00
T 00
= 2 = −λ,
X
a T
which is equivalent to
X 00 + λX = 0
and
T 00 + a2 λT = 0.

(12.2.6)

Since v(0, t) = X(0)T (t) = 0 and v(L, t) = X(L)T (t) = 0 and we don’t want T to be identically zero,
X(0) = 0 and X(L) = 0. Therefore λ must be an eigenvalue of
X 00 + λX = 0,

X(0) = 0,

X(L) = 0,

(12.2.7)

and X must be a λ-eigenfunction. From Theorem 11.1.2, the eigenvalues of (12.2.7) are λn = n2 π 2 /L2 ,
with associated eigenfunctions
Xn = sin

nπx
,
L

n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..

Substituting λ = n2 π 2 /L2 into (12.2.6) yields

which has the general solution

Since there are no convergence-producing factors in (12.2.8) like the negative exponentials in t that
appear in formal solutions of initial-boundary value problems for the heat equation, it isn’t obvious that
(12.2.8) even converges for any values of x and t, let alone that it can be differentiated term by term to
show that utt = a2 uxx. However, the next theorem guarantees that the series converges not only for
0 ≤ x ≤ L and t ≥ 0, but for −∞ < x < ∞ and −∞ < t < ∞.

This and (12.2.12) imply (12.2.9), which completes the proof.
As we’ll see below, if Sg is differentiable and Sf is twice differentiable on (−∞, ∞), then (12.2.9)
satisfies utt = a2 uxx for all (x, t). We need the next theorem to formulate conditions on f and g such
that Sf and Sg to have these properties.

Proof Throughout this proof, k denotes an integer. Since f is differentiable on the open interval (0, L),
both p and q are differentiable on every open interval ((k − 1)L, kL). Thus, we need only to determine
whether p and q are differentiable at x = kL for every k.
(a) From Figure 12.2.3, p is discontinuous at x = 2kL if h(0) 6= 0 and discontinuous at x = (2k − 1)L
if h(L) 6= 0. Therefore p is not differentiable on (−∞, ∞) unless h(0) = h(L) = 0. From Figure 12.2.4,
if h(0) = h(L) = 0, then
p0 (2kL) = h0+ (0) and

p0 ((2k − 1)L) = h0− (L)

for every k; therefore, p is differentiable on (−∞, ∞).

Proof We first show that Sg is differentiable and Sf is twice differentiable on (−∞, ∞). We’ll then
differentiate (12.2.9) twice with respect to x and t and verify that (12.2.9) is an actual solution of (12.2.1).
Since f and g are continuous on (0, L), Theorem 11.3.2 implies that Sf (x) = f(x) and Sg (x) = g(x)
on [0, L]. Therefore Sf and Sg are the odd periodic extensions of f and g. Since f and g are differentiable on [0, L], (12.2.15), (12.2.16), and Theorem 12.2.3(a) imply that Sf and Sg are differentiable on
(−∞, ∞).
Since Sf0 (x) = f 0 (x) on [0, L] (one-sided derivatives at the endpoints), and Sf0 is even (the derivative
of an odd function is even), Sf0 is the even periodic extension of f 0 . By assumption, f 0 is differentiable
on [0, L]. Because of (12.2.17), Theorem 12.2.3(b) with h = f 0 and q = Sf0 implies that Sf00 exists on
(−∞, ∞).
Now we can differentiate (12.2.9) twice with respect to x and t:

(12.2.20)

Comparing (12.2.18) and (12.2.20) shows that utt (x, t) = a2 uxx(x, t) for all (x, t).
From (12.2.8), u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0 for all t. From (12.2.9), u(x, 0) = Sf (x) for all x, and therefore,
in particular,
u(x, 0) = f(x), 0 ≤ x < L.
From (12.2.19), ut (x, 0) = Sg (x) for all x, and therefore, in particular,
ut (x, 0) = g(x),

0 ≤ x < L.

Therefore u is an actual solution of (12.2.1). This completes the proof.
Eqn (12.2.9) is called d’Alembert’s solution of (12.2.1). Although d’Alembert’s solution was useful
for proving Theorem 12.2.4 and is very useful in a slightly different context (Exercises 63-68), (12.2.8)
is preferable for computational purposes.

f(x) = x(x3 − 2Lx2 + L2 )

Theorem 12.1.2 implies that uxx and utt can be obtained by term by term differentiation, for all (x, t),
so utt = a2 uxx for all (x, t) (Exercise 62). Moreover, Theorem 11.3.2 implies that Sf (x) = f(x) and
Sg (x) = g(x) if 0 ≤ x ≤ L. Therefore u(x, 0) = f(x) and ut (x, 0) = g(x) if 0 ≤ x ≤ L. Hence, u is
an actual solution of the initial-boundary value problem.
R EMARK: In solving a specific initial-boundary value problem (12.2.1), it’s convenient to solve the problem with g ≡ 0, then with f ≡ 0, and add the solutions to obtain the solution of the given problem.
Because of this, either f ≡ 0 or g ≡ 0 in all the specific initial-boundary value problems in the exercises.
The Plucked String
If f and g don’t satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 12.2.4, then (12.2.8) isn’t an actual solution of
(12.2.1) in fact, it can be shown that (12.2.1) doesn’t have an actual solution in this case. Nevertheless, u
is defined for all (x, t), and we can see from (12.2.18) and (12.2.20) that utt (x, t) = a2 uxx (x, t) for all
(x, t) such that Sf00 (x ± at) and Sg0 (x ± at) exist. Moreover, u may still provide a useful approximation
to the vibration of the string; a laboratory experiment can confirm or deny this.
We’ll now consider the initial-boundary value problem (12.2.1) with

x,
0 ≤ x ≤ L2 ,
f(x) =
(12.2.21)
L − x, L2 ≤ x ≤ L
and g ≡ 0. Since f isn’t differentiable at x = L/2, it does’nt satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 12.2.4,
so the formal solution of (12.2.1) can’t be an actual solution. Nevertheless, it’s instructive to investigate
the properties of the formal solution.
The graph of f is shown in Figure 12.2.7. Intuitively, we are plucking the string by half its length at the
middle. You’re right if you think this is an extraordinarily large displacement; however, we could remove
this objection by multiplying the function in Figure 12.2.7 by a small constant. Since this would just
multiply the formal solution by the same constant, we’ll leave f as we’ve defined it. Similar comments
apply to the exercises.
From Exercise 11.3.15, the Fourier sine series of f on [0, L] is

and the initial condition
u(x, 0) = f(x),

0 ≤ x ≤ L.

However, we can’t justify differentiating (12.2.22) term by term even once, and formally differentiating it
twice term by term produces a series that diverges for all (x, t). (Verify.). Therefore we use d’Alembert’s
form

u(x, t) = [Sf (x + at) + Sf (x − at)]
(12.2.23)

for u to study its derivatives. Figure 12.2.8 shows the graph of Sf , which is the odd periodic extension
of f. You can see from the graph that Sf is differentiable at x (and Sf0 (x) = ±1) if and only if x isn’t an
odd multiple of L/2.

(12.2.21)

In Figure 12.2.9 the dashed and solid curves are the graphs of y = Sf (x − at) and y = Sf (x + at)
respectively, for a fixed value of t. As t increases the dashed curve moves to the right and the solid
curve moves to the left. For this reason, we say that the functions u1 (x, t) = Sf (x + at) and u2 (x, t) =
Sf (x − at) are traveling waves. Note that u1 satisfies the wave equation at (x, t) if x + at isn’t an
odd multiple of L/2 and u2 satisfies the wave equation at (x, t) if x − at isn’t an odd multiple of L/2.
Therefore (12.2.23) (or, equivalently, (12.2.22)) satisfies utt (x, t) = a2 uxx (x, t) = 0 for all (x, t) such
that neither x − at nor x + at is an odd multiple of L/2.
We conclude by finding an explicit formula for u(x, t) under the assumption that

and

We suggest that you perform experiments of this kind in the exercises marked C , without other
specific instructions. (These exercises were chosen arbitrarily; the experiment is worthwhile in all the
exercises dealing with specific initial-boundary value problems.) In some of the exercises the formal
solutions have other forms, defined in Exercises 17, 34, and 49; however, the idea of the experiment is
the same.

If a string vibrates with the end at x = 0 free to move in a frictionless vertical track and the end at
x = L fixed, then the initial-boundary value problem for its displacement takes the form
utt = a2 uxx , 0 < x < L, t > 0,
ux(0, t) = 0, u(L, t) = 0, t > 0,
u(x, 0) = f(x), ut (x, 0) = g(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L.

12.3 LAPLACE’S EQUATION IN RECTANGULAR COORDINATES
The temperature u = u(x, y, t) in a two-dimensional plate satisfies the two-dimensional heat equation
ut = a2 (uxx + uyy ),

(12.3.1)

where (x, y) varies over the interior of the plate and t > 0. To find a solution of (12.3.1), it’s necessary to
specify the initial temperature u(x, y, 0) and conditions that must be satisfied on the boundary. However,
as t → ∞, the influence of the initial condition decays, so
lim ut (x, y, t) = 0

t→∞

and the temperature approaches a steady state distribution u = u(x, y) that satisfies
uxx + uyy = 0.

(12.3.2)

This is Laplace’s equation. This equation also arises in applications to fluid mechanics and potential
theory; in fact, it is also called the potential equation. We seek solutions of (12.3.2) in a region R that
satisfy specified conditions – called boundary conditions – on the boundary of R. For example, we may
require u to assume prescribed values on the boundary. This is called a Dirichlet condition, and the
problem is called a Dirichlet problem. Or, we may require the normal derivative of u at each point (x, y)
on the boundary to assume prescribed values. This is called a Neumann condition, and the problem is
called a Neumann problem. In some problems we impose Dirichlet conditions on part of the boundary
and Neumann conditions on the rest. Then we say that the boundary conditions and the problem are
mixed.
Solving boundary value problems for (12.3.2) over general regions is beyond the scope of this book,
so we consider only very simple regions. We begin by considering the rectangular region shown in
Figure 12.3.1.
The possible boundary conditions for this region can be written as

BVP(α, β, γ, δ)(0, 0, 0, g1)

is a solution of
BVP(α, β, γ, δ)(f0 , f1 , g0 , g1 ).
Therefore we concentrate on problems where only one of the functions f0 , f1 , g0 , g2 isn’t identically
zero. There are 64 (count them!) problems of this form. Each has homogeneous boundary conditions on
three sides of the rectangle, and a nonhomogeneous boundary condition on the fourth. We use separation
of variables to find infinitely many functions that satisfy Laplace’s equation and the three homogeneous
boundary conditions in the open rectangle. We then use these solutions as building blocks to construct a
formal solution of Laplace’s equation that also satisfies the nonhomogeneous boundary condition. Since
it’s not feasible to consider all 64 cases, we’ll restrict our attention in the text to just four. Others are
discussed in the exercises.

(12.3.3)

From here, the strategy depends upon the boundary conditions. We illustrate this by examples.
Example 12.3.1 Define the formal solution of
uxx + uyy = 0, 0 < x < a, 0 < y < b,
u(x, 0) = f(x), u(x, b) = 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ a,
u(0, y) = 0, u(a, y) = 0, 0 ≤ y ≤ b

(12.3.4)

(Figure 12.3.4).
Solution The boundary conditions in (12.3.4) require products v(x, y) = X(x)Y (y) such that X(0) =
X(a) = Y (b) = 0; hence, we let k = −λ in (12.3.3). Thus, X and Y must satisfy
X 00 + λX = 0,

X(0) = 0,

X(a) = 0

(12.3.5)

and
Y 00 − λY = 0,

Y (b) = 0.

n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..

so we could take
Yn = sinh

however, because of the nonhomogeneous Dirichlet condition at y = 0, it’s better to require that Yn (0) =

Then

so vn (x, 0) = sin nπx/a and vn satisfies (12.3.4) with f(x) = sin nπx/a. More generally, if α1 , . . . ,

for large n, so the series in (12.3.8) converges if 0 < y < b; moreover, since also
cosh nπ(b − y)/a

sinh nπb/a
for large n, Theorem 12.1.2 applied twice with z = x and twice with z = t, shows that uxx and uyy can
be obtained by differentiating u term by term if 0 < y < b. (Exercise 37). Therefore u satisfies Laplace’s
equation in the interior of the rectangle in Figure 12.3.4. Moreover, the series in (12.3.8) also converges
on the boundary of the rectangle, and satisfies the three homogeneous boundary conditions conditions in
(12.3.4). Therefore, since u(x, 0) = S(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ L, u is an actual solution of (12.3.5) if and only if
S(x) = f(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ a. From Theorem 11.3.2, this is true if f is continuous and piecewise smooth
on [0, L], and f(0) = f(L) = 0.

Because of (12.3.9), small values of m provide sufficient accuracy for most applications if 0 < y < b.
Moreover, the n3 in the denominator in (12.3.10) ensures that this is also true for y = 0. For graphing
purposes, we chose a = 2, b = 1, and m = 10. Figure 12.3.5 shows the surface

656 Chapter 12 Fourier Solutions of Partial Differential Equations
X 0 (a) = Y (0) = 0; hence, we let k = −λ in (12.3.3). Thus, X and Y must satisfy
X 00 + λX = 0,

X 0 (0) = 0,

X 0 (a) = 0

(12.3.12)

and
Y 00 − λY = 0,

Y (0) = 0.

(12.3.13)

From Theorem 11.1.3, the eigenvalues of (12.3.12) are λ = 0, with associated eigenfunction X0 = 1,
and λn = n2 π 2 /a2 , with associated eigenfunctions
Xn = cos

nπx

a

n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

Since Y0 = y satisfies (12.3.13) with λ = 0, we take v0 (x, y) = X0 (x)Y0 (y) = y. Substituting
λ = n2 π 2 /a2 into (12.3.13) yields
Y 00 − (n2 π 2 /a2 )Y = 0,

Y (0) = 0,

so we could take

However, because of the nonhomogeneous Neumann condition at y = b, it’s better to require that Yn0 (b) =

thus,

However, because of the nonhomogeneous Dirichlet condition at x = 0, it’s better to require that Xn (0) =

Xn = cosh

12.4 LAPLACE’S EQUATION IN POLAR COORDINATES
In Section 12.3 we solved boundary value problems for Laplace’s equation over a rectangle with sides
parallel to the x, y-axes. Now we’ll consider boundary value problems for Laplace’s equation over regions
with boundaries best described in terms of polar coordinates. In this case it’s appropriate to regard u as
function of (r, θ) and write Laplace’s equation in polar form as

where λ is a separation constant. (Verify.) This equation is equivalent to
Θ00 + λΘ = 0
and
r 2 R00 + rR0 − λR = 0.

(12.4.3)

Since (r, π) and (r, −π) are the polar coordinates of the same point, we impose periodic boundary conditions on Θ; that is,
Θ00 + λΘ = 0,

Θ(−π) = Θ(π),

Θ0 (−π) = Θ0 (π).

(12.4.4)

Since we don’t want RΘ to be identically zero, λ must be an eigenvalue of (12.4.4) and Θ must be an
associated eigenfunction. From Theorem 11.1.6, the eigenvalues of (12.4.4) are λ0 = 0 with associated
eigenfunctions Θ0 = 1 and, for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , λn = n2 , with associated eigenfunction cos nθ and
sin nθ therefore,
Θn = αn cos nθ + βn sin nθ
where αn and βn are constants.
Substituting λ = 0 into (12.4.3) yields the
r 2 R00 + rR0 = 0,
so

and
R0 = c2 + c1 ln r.
If c1 6= 0 then

r→0+

which doesn’t make sense if we interpret u0 (r, θ) = R0 (r)Θ0 (θ) = R0 (r) as the steady state temperature
distribution in a disk whose boundary is maintained at the constant temperature R0 (ρ). Therefore we now
require R0 to be bounded as r → 0+. This implies that c1 = 0, and we take c2 = 1. Thus, R0 = 1 and
v0 (r, θ) = R0 (r)Θ0 (θ) = 1. Note that v0 satisfies (12.4.2) with f(θ) = 1.
Substituting λ = n2 into (12.4.3) yields the Euler equation
r 2 R00n + rR0n − n2 Rn = 0
for Rn . The indicial polynomial of this equation is
s(s − 1) + s − n2 = (s − n)(s + n),

(12.4.6)

Section 12.4 Laplace’s Equation in Polar Coordinates

669

so the general solution of (12.4.6) is
Rn = c1 r n + c2 r −n ,

(12.4.7)

by Theorem 7.4.3. Consistent with our previous assumption on R0 , we now require Rn to be bounded as
r → 0+. This implies that c2 = 0, and we choose c1 = ρ−n . Then Rn (r) = r n /ρn , so
vn (r, θ) = Rn (r)Θn (θ) =

rn

Now vn satisfies (12.4.2) with

P∞
Since n=0 nk (r/ρ)n converges for every k if 0 < r < ρ, Theorem 12.1.2 can be used to show that
if 0 < r < ρ then (12.4.8) can be differentiated term by term any number of times with respect to both r
and θ. Since the terms in (12.4.8) satisfy Laplace’s equation if r > 0, (12.4.8) satisfies Laplace’s equation
if 0 < r < ρ. Therefore, since u(ρ, θ) = F (θ), u is an actual solution of (12.4.2) if and only if
F (θ) = f(θ),

−π ≤ θ < π.

From Theorem 11.2.4, this is true if f is continuous and piecewise smooth on [−π, π] and f(−π) = f(π).

13.1 TWO-POINT BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
In Section 5.3 we considered initial value problems for the linear second order equation
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F (x).

(13.1.1)

Suppose P0 , P1 , P2 , and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros on an open interval (a, b). From Theorem 5.3.1, if x0 is in (a, b) and k1 and k2 are arbitrary real numbers then (13.1.1) has a unique solution
on (a, b) such that y(x0 ) = k1 and y0 (x0 ) = k2 . Now we consider a different problem for (13.1.1).
PROBLEM Suppose P0 , P1 , P2 , and F are continous and P0 has no zeros on a closed interval [a, b].
Let α, β, ρ, and δ be real numbers such that
α2 + β 2 6= 0 and

ρ2 + δ 2 6= 0,

(13.1.2)

and let k1 and k2 be arbitrary real numbers. Find a solution of
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y = F (x)

(13.1.3)

on the closed interval [a, b] such that
αy(a) + βy0 (a) = k1

(13.1.4)

ρy(b) + δy0 (b) = k2 .

(13.1.5)

and

The assumptions stated in this problem apply throughout this section and won’t be repeated. Note
that we imposed conditions on P0 , P1 , P2 , and F on the closed interval [a, b], and we are interested in
solutions of (13.1.3) on the closed interval. This is different from the situation considered in Chapter 5,
where we imposed conditions on P0 , P1 , P2 , and F on the open interval (a, b) and we were interested in
solutions on the open interval. There is really no problem here; we can always extend P0 , P1 , P2 , and
F to an open interval (c, d) (for example, by defining them to be constant on (c, d] and [b, d)) so that
they are continuous and P0 has no zeros on [c, d]. Then we can apply the theorems from Chapter 5 to the
equation
P1 (x) 0 P2 (x)
F (x)
y00 +
y +
y=
P0 (x)
P0 (x)
P0 (x)
on (c, d) to draw conclusions about solutions of (13.1.3) on [a, b].
We call a and b boundary points. The conditions (13.1.4) and (13.1.5) are boundary conditions, and the
problem is a two-point boundary value problem or, for simplicity, a boundary value problem. (We used
similar terminology in Chapter 12 with a different meaning; both meanings are in common usage.) We
require (13.1.2) to insure that we’re imposing a sensible condition at each boundary point. For example,
if α2 + β 2 = 0 then α = β = 0, so αy(a) + βy0 (a) = 0 for all choices of y(a) and y0 (a). Therefore
(13.1.4) is an impossible condition if k1 6= 0, or no condition at all if k1 = 0.
We abbreviate (13.1.1) as Ly = F , where
Ly = P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P0 (x)y,
and we denote
B1 (y) = αy(a) + βy0 (a) and

B2 (y) = ρy(b) + δy0 (b).

We combine (13.1.3), (13.1.4), and (13.1.5) as
Ly = F,

B1 (y) = k1 ,

B2 (y) = k2 .

(13.1.6)

678 Chapter 13 Boundary Value Problems for Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations
This boundary value problem is homogeneous if F = 0 and k1 = k2 = 0; otherwise it’s nonhomogeneous.
We leave it to you (Exercise 1) to verify that B1 and B2 are linear operators; that is, if c1 and c2 are
constants then
Bi (c1 y1 + c2 y2 ) = c1 Bi (y1 ) + c2 Bi (y2 ), i = 1, 2.
(13.1.7)
The next three examples show that the question of existence and uniqueness for solutions of boundary
value problems is more complicated than for initial value problems.
Example 13.1.1 Consider the boundary value problem
y00 + y = 1,

y(0) = 0,

y(π/2) = 0.

The general solution of y00 + y = 1 is
y = 1 + c1 sin x + c2 cos x,
so y(0) = 0 if and only if c2 = −1 and y(π/2) = 0 if and only if c1 = −1. Therefore
y = 1 − sin x − cos x
is the unique solution of the boundary value problem.
Example 13.1.2 Consider the boundary value problem
y00 + y = 1,

y(0) = 0,

y(π) = 0.

Again, the general solution of y00 + y = 1 is
y = 1 + c1 sin x + c2 cos x,
so y(0) = 0 if and only if c2 = −1, but y(π) = 0 if and only if c2 = 1. Therefore the boundary value
problem has no solution.
Example 13.1.3 Consider the boundary value problem
y00 + y = sin 2x,

y(0) = 0,

y(π) = 0.

You can use the method of undetermined coefficients (Section 5.5) to find that the general solution of
y00 + y = sin 2x is
sin 2x
y=−
+ c1 sin x + c2 cos x.
3
The boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y(π) = 0 both require that c2 = 0, but they don’t restrict c1 .
Therefore the boundary value problem has infinitely many solutions
y=−

sin 2x
+ c1 sin x,
3

where c1 is arbitrary.
Theorem 13.1.1 If z1 and z2 are solutions of Ly = 0 such that either B1 (z1 ) = B1 (z2 ) = 0 or B2 (z1 ) =
B2 (z2 ) = 0, then {z1 , z2 } is linearly dependent. Equivalently, if {z1 , z2 } is linearly independent, then
B12 (z1 ) + B12 (z2 ) 6= 0 and

B22 (z1 ) + B22 (z2 ) 6= 0.

Section 13.1 Two-Point Boundary Value Problems

679

Proof Recall that B1 (z) = αz(a) + βz 0 (a) and α2 + β 2 6= 0. Therefore, if B1 (z1 ) = B1 (z2 ) = 0 then
(α, β) is a nontrivial solution of the system
αz1 (a) + βz10 (a)
αz2 (a) + βz 0 (a)

=
=

0
0.

This implies that
z1 (a)z20 (a) − z10 (a)z2 (a) = 0,
so {z1 , z2 } is linearly dependent, by Theorem 5.1.6. We leave it to you to show that {z1 , z2 } is linearly
dependent if B2 (z1 ) = B2 (z2 ) = 0.
Theorem 13.1.2 The following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either all true or all false.
(a) There’s a fundamental set {z1 , z2 } of solutions of Ly = 0 such that
B1 (z1 )B2 (z2 ) − B1 (z2 )B2 (z1 ) 6= 0.

(13.1.8)

(b) If {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0 then
B1 (y1 )B2 (y2 ) − B1 (y2 )B2 (y1 ) 6= 0.

(13.1.9)

(c) For each continuous F and pair of constants (k1 , k2 ), the boundary value problem
Ly = F,

B1 (y) = k1 ,

B2 (y) = k2

has a unique solution.
(d) The homogeneous boundary value problem
Ly = 0,

B1 (y) = 0,

B2 (y) = 0

(13.1.10)

has only the trivial solution y = 0.
(e) The homogeneous equation Ly = 0 has linearly independent solutions z1 and z2 such that B1 (z1 ) =
0 and B2 (z2 ) = 0.
Proof

We’ll show that
(a) =⇒ (b) =⇒ (c) =⇒ (d) =⇒ (e) =⇒ (a).

(a) =⇒ (b): Since {z1 , z2 } is a fundamental set of solutions for Ly = 0, there are constants a1 , a2 ,
b1 , and b2 such that
y1 = a1 z1 + a2 z2

y2 = b1 z1 + b2 z2 .
Moreover,

because if this determinant were zero, its rows would be linearly dependent and therefore {y1 , y2 } would
be linearly dependent, contrary to our assumption that {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly =

680 Chapter 13 Boundary Value Problems for Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations
Since the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of the determinants of the matrices, (13.1.8)
and (13.1.12) imply (13.1.9).
(b) =⇒ (c): Since {y1 , y2 } is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0, the general solution of
Ly = F is
y = yp + c1 y1 + c2 y2 ,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants and yp is a particular solution of Ly = F . To satisfy the boundary
conditions, we must choose c1 and c2 so that
k1
k2

=

B1 (yp ) + c1 B1 (y1 ) + c2 B1 (y2 )
B2 (yp ) + c1 B2 (y1 ) + c2 B2 (y2 ),

(recall (13.1.7)), which is equivalent to
c1 B1 (y1 ) + c2 B1 (y2 ) = k1 − B1 (yp )

c1 B2 (y1 ) + c2 B2 (22 ) = k2 − B2 (yp ).
From (13.1.9), this system always has a unique solution (c1 , c2 ).
(c) =⇒ (d): Obviously, y = 0 is a solution of (13.1.10). From (c) with F = 0 and k1 = k2 = 0, it’s
the only solution.
(d) =⇒ (e): Let {y1 , y2 } be a fundamental system for Ly = 0 and let
z1 = B1 (y2 )y1 − B1 (y1 )y2 and

z2 = B2 (y2 )y1 − B2 (y1 )y2 .

Then B1 (z1 ) = 0 and B2 (z2 ) = 0. To see that z1 and z2 are linearly independent, note that
a1 z1 + a2 z2

a1 [B1 (y2 )y1 − B1 (y1 )y2 ] + a2 [B2 (y2 )y1 − B2 (y1 )y2 ]

Therefore, since y1 and y2 are linearly independent, a1 z1 + a2 z2 = 0 if and only if

This and (13.1.7) imply that y = c1 z1 + c2 z2 is a nontrivial solution of (13.1.10), which contradicts (d).
(e) =⇒ (a). Theorem 13.1.1 implies that if B1 (z1 ) = 0 and B2 (z2 ) = 0 then B1 (z2 ) 6= 0 and
B2 (z1 ) 6= 0. This implies (13.1.8), which completes the proof.
Example 13.1.4 Solve the boundary value problem
x2 y00 − 2xy0 + 2y − 2x3 = 0,

y(1) = 4,

y0 (2) = 3,

(13.1.13)

given that {x, x2} is a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation
Solution Using variation of parameters (Section 5.7), you can show that yp = x3 is a solution of the
complementary equation
x2 y00 − 2xy0 + 2y = 2x3 = 0.

Section 13.1 Two-Point Boundary Value Problems

681

Therefore the solution of (13.1.13) can be written as
y = x 3 + c1 x + c2 x 2 .
Then
y0 = 3x2 + c1 + 2c2 x,
and imposing the boundary conditions yields the system

so c1 = 7 and c2 = −4. Therefore

c1 + c2

=

3

c1 + 4c2

=

−9,

y = x3 + 7x − 4x2

is the unique solution of (13.1.13)
Example 13.1.5 Solve the boundary value problem
y00 − 7y0 + 12y = 4e2x,

y(0) = 3,

y(1) = 5e2 .

Solution From Example 5.4.1, yp = 2e2x is a particular solution of
y00 − 7y0 + 12y = 4e2x.

(13.1.14)

Since {e3x, e4x } is a fundamental set for the complementary equation, we could write the solution of
(13.1.13) as
y = 2e2x + c1 e3x + c2 e4x
and determine c1 and c2 by imposing the boundary conditions. However, this would lead to some tedious
algebra, and the form of the solution would be very unappealing. (Try it!) In this case it’s convenient to
use the fundamental system {z1 , z2 } mentioned in Theorem 13.1.2(e); that is, we choose {z1 , z2 } so that
B1 (z1 ) = z1 (0) = 0 and B2 (z2 ) = z2 (1) = 0. It is easy to see that
z1 = e3x − e4x and

z2 = e3(x−1) − e4(x−1)

satisfy these requirements. Now we write the solution of (13.1.14) as



y = 2e2x + c1 e3x − e4x + c2 e3(x−1) − e4(x−1) .
Imposing the boundary conditions y(0) = 3 and y(1) = 5e2 yields
3 = 2 + c2 e−4 (e − 1) and
Therefore

theorem addresses this question.

This is the Green’s function for the boundary value problem (13.1.16). The Green’s function is related
to the boundary value problem (13.1.16) in much the same way that the inverse of a square matrix A is
related to the linear algebraic system y = Ax; just as we substitute the given vector y into the formula
x = A−1 y to solve y = Ax, we substitute the given function F into the formula (13.1.20) to obtain the
solution of (13.1.16). The analogy goes further: just as A−1 exists if and only if Ax = 0 has only the
trivial solution, the boundary value problem (13.1.16) has a Green’s function if and only the homogeneous
boundary value problem (13.1.15) has only the trivial solution.

Therefore
B1 (z1 )B2 (z2 ) − B1 (z2 )B2 (z1 ) = 2,

so Theorem 13.1.2 implies that (13.1.21) has a unique solution. Let

y1 = B1 (z2 )z1 − B1 (z1 )z2 = cos x − sin x
and
y2 = B2 (z2 )z1 − B2 (z1 )z2 = cos x + sin x.

Then B1 (y1 ) = 0, B2 (y2 ) = 0, and the Wronskian of {y1 , y2 } is
W (x) =

cos x − sin x
− sin x − cos x

cos x + sin x

Theorem 13.1.4 Suppose the homogeneous boundary value problem
Ly = 0,

B1 (y) = 0,

B2 (y) = 0

(13.1.22)

has a nontrivial solution y1 , and let y2 be any solution of Ly = 0 that isn’t a constant multiple of y1 . Let

then (13.1.24) has no solution.

Since B1 (y1 ) = 0, Theorem 13.1.1 implies that B1 (y2 ) 6= 0; hence, B1 (y) = 0 if and only if c2 = 0.
Therefore y = yp + c1 y1 and

if (13.1.23) holds. This completes the proof.

13.2 STURM-LIOUVILLE PROBLEMS
In this section we consider eigenvalue problems of the form
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y + λR(x)y = 0,

B1 (y) = 0,

B2 (y) = 0,

(13.2.1)

where
B1 (y) = αy(a) + βy0 (a) and

B2 (y) = ρy(b) + δy0 (b).

As in Section 13.1, α, β, ρ, and δ are real numbers, with
α2 + β 2 > 0 and

ρ2 + δ 2 > 0,

P0 , P1 , P2 , and R are continuous, and P0 and R are positive on [a, b].
We say that λ is an eigenvalue of (13.2.1) if (13.2.1) has a nontrivial solution y. In this case, y is an
eigenfunction associated with λ, or a λ-eigenfunction. Solving the eigenvalue problem means finding all
eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of (13.2.1).
Example 13.2.1 Solve the eigenvalue problem
y0 + 3y0 + 2y + λy = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y(1) = 0.

If λ < 1/4 then r1 and r2 are real and distinct, so the general solution of the differential equation in

Since the determinant of this system is er2 − er1 6= 0, the system has only the trivial solution. Therefore
λ isn’t an eigenvalue of (13.2.2).
If λ = 1/4 then r1 = r2 = −3/2, so the general solution of (13.2.2) is
y = e−3x/2 (c1 + c2 x).
The boundary condition y(0) = 0 requires that c1 = 0, so y = c2 xe−3x/2 and the boundary condition
y(0) requires that c2 = 0. Therefore λ = 1/4 isn’t an eigenvalue of (13.2.2).

In this case the general solution of the differential equation in (13.2.2) is
y = e−3x/2 (c1 cos ωx + c2 sin ωx).
The boundary condition y(0) = 0 requires that c1 = 0, so y = c2 e−3x/2 sin ωx, which holds with c2 6= 0
if and only if ω = nπ, where n is an integer. We may assume that n is a positive integer. (Why?). From
(13.2.3), the eigenvalues are λn = (1 + 4n2 π 2 )/4, with associated eigenfunctions
yn = e−3x/2 sin nπx,

n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

Example 13.2.2 Solve the eigenvalue problem
x2 y00 + xy0 + λy = 0,

y(1) = 0,

y(2) = 0.

(13.2.4)

Solution If λ = 0, the differential equation in (13.2.4) reduces to x(xy0 )0 = 0, so xy0 = c1 ,
c1
y0 = , and y = c1 ln x + c2 .
x
The boundary condition y(1) = 0 requires that c2 = 0, so y = c1 ln x. The boundary condition y(2) = 0
requires that c1 ln 2 = 0, so c1 = 0. Therefore zero isn’t an eigenvalue of (13.2.4).
If λ < 0, we write λ = −k 2 with k > 0, so (13.2.4) becomes
x2 y00 + xy0 − k 2 y = 0,
an Euler equation (Section 7.4) with indicial equation
r 2 − k 2 = (r − k)(r + k) = 0.
Therefore
y = c1 xk + c2 x−k .
The boundary conditions require that

0.

Since the determinant of this system is 2−k − 2k 6= 0, c1 = c2 = 0. Therefore (13.2.4) has no negative
eigenvalues.
If λ > 0 we write λ = k 2 with k > 0. Then (13.2.4) becomes
x2 y00 + xy0 + k 2 y = 0,
an Euler equation with indicial equation
r 2 + k 2 = (r − ik)(r + ik) = 0,
so
y = c1 cos(k ln x) + c2 sin(k ln x).
The boundary condition y(1) = 0 requires that c1 = 0. Therefore y = c2 sin(k ln x). This holds with
c2 6= 0 if and only if k = nπ/ ln 2, where n is a positive integer. Hence, the eigenvalues of (13.2.4) are

For theoretical purposes, it’s useful to rewrite the differential equation in (13.2.1) in a different form,
provided by the next theorem.

690 Chapter 13 Boundary Value Problems for Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations
Theorem 13.2.1 If P0 , P1 , P2 , and R are continuous and P0 and R are positive on a closed interval
[a, b], then the equation
P0 (x)y00 + P1 (x)y0 + P2 (x)y + λR(x)y = 0
(13.2.5)
can be rewritten as
(p(x)y0 )0 + q(x)y + λr(x)y = 0,

(13.2.6)

where p, p0 , q and r are continuous and p and r are positive on [a, b].
Proof

We begin by rewriting (13.2.5) as
y00 + u(x)y0 + v(x)y + λR1 (x)y = 0,

(13.2.7)

with u = P1 /P0 , v = P2 /P0 , and R1 = R/P0 . (Note that R1 is positive on [a, b].) Now let p(x) = eU (x) ,
where U is any antiderivative of u. Then p is positive on [a, b] and, since U 0 = u,
p0 (x) = p(x)u(x)

(13.2.8)

is continuous on [a, b]. Multiplying (13.2.7) by p(x) yields
p(x)y00 + p(x)u(x)y0 + p(x)v(x)y + λp(x)R1 (x)y = 0.

(13.2.9)

Since p is positive on [a, b], this equation has the same solutions as (13.2.5). From (13.2.8),
(p(x)y0 )0 = p(x)y00 + p0 (x)y0 = p(x)y00 + p(x)u(x)y0 ,
so (13.2.9) can be rewritten as in (13.2.6), with q(x) = p(x)v(x) and r(x) = p(x)R1 (x). This completes
the proof.
It is to be understood throughout the rest of this section that p, q, and r have the properties stated in
Theorem 13.2.1. Moreover, whenever we write Ly in a general statement, we mean
Ly = (p(x)y0 )0 + q(x)y.
The differential equation (13.2.6) is called a Sturm–Liouville equation, and the eigenvalue problem
(p(x)y0 )0 + q(x)y + λr(x)y = 0,

B1 (y) = 0,

B2 (y) = 0,

(13.2.10)

which is equivalent to (13.2.1), is called a Sturm-Liouville problem.
Example 13.2.3 Rewrite the eigenvalue problem
y00 + 3y0 + (2 + λ)y = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y(1) = 0

(13.2.11)

of Example 13.2.1 as a Sturm-Liouville problem.
Solution Comparing (13.2.11) to (13.2.7) shows that u(x) = 3, so we take U (x) = 3x and p(x) = e3x .
Multiplying the differential equation in (13.2.11) by e3x yields
e3x (y00 + 3y0 ) + 2e3x y + λe3x y = 0.
Since
e3x (y00 + 3y0 ) = (e3x y0 )0 ,
(13.2.11) is equivalent to the Sturm–Liouville problem
(e3x y0 )0 + 2e3xy + λe3x y = 0,

y(0) = 0,

y(1) = 0.

(13.2.14)

Problems 1–4 of Section 11.1 are Sturm–Liouville problems. (Problem 5 isn’t , although some authors
use a definition of Sturm-Liouville problem that does include it.) We were able to find the eigenvalues
of Problems 1-4 explicitly because in each problem the coefficients in the boundary conditions satisfy
αβ = 0 and ρδ = 0; that is, each boundary condition involves either y or y0 , but not both. If this isn’t
true then the eigenvalues can’t in general be expressed exactly by simple formulas; rather, approximate
values must be obtained by numerical solution of equations derived by requiring the determinants of
certain 2 × 2 systems of homogeneous equations to be zero. To apply the numerical methods effectively,
graphical methods must be used to determine approximate locations of the zeros of these determinants.
Then the zeros can be computed accurately by numerical methods.
Example 13.2.5 Solve the Sturm–Liouville problem
y00 + λy = 0,

y(0) + y0 (0) = 0,

y(1) + 3y0 (1) = 0.

(13.2.15)

Solution If λ = 0, the differential equation in (13.2.15) reduces to y00 = 0, with general solution
y = c1 + c2 x. The boundary conditions require that
c1 + c2
c1 + 4c2

=
=

0
0,

so c1 = c2 = 0. Therefore zero isn’t an eigenvalue of (13.2.15).
If λ < 0, we write λ = −k 2 where k > 0, and the differential equation in (13.2.15) becomes y00 −
2
k y = 0, with general solution
y = c1 cosh kx + c2 sinh kx,
(13.2.16)
so
y0 = k(c1 sinh kx + c2 cosh kx).

The graph of the right side
√(Figure 13.2.1) has a vertical asymptote at√k = 1/ 3. Since the two sides have
different signs if k < 1/ 3, this equation has no solution in (0, 1/ 3). Figure 13.2.1 shows the graphs
of the two sides of (13.2.18) on an interval to the right of the vertical asymptote, which is indicated by
the dashed line. You can see that the two curves intersect near k0 = 1.2, Given this estmate, you can use
Newton’s to compute k0 more accurately. We computed k0 ≈ 1.1219395. Therefore −k02 ≈ −1.2587483
is an eigenvalue of (13.2.15). From (13.2.16) and the first equation in (13.2.17),
y0 = k0 cosh k0 x − sinh k0 x.
If λ > 0 we write λ = k 2 where k > 0, and differential equation in (13.2.15) becomes y00 + k 2 y = 0,

so

From (13.2.19) and the first equation in (13.2.20),
yn = kn cos kn x − sin kn x
is an eigenfunction associated with λn
Since the differential equations in (13.2.12) and (13.2.14) are more complicated than those in (13.2.11)
and (13.2.13) respectively, what is the point of Theorem 13.2.1? The point is this: to solve a specific
problem, it may be better to deal with it directly, as we did in Examples 13.2.1 and 13.2.2; however, we’ll
see that transforming the general eigenvalue problem (13.2.1) to the Sturm–Liouville problem (13.2.10)
leads to results applicable to all eigenvalue problems of the form (13.2.1).
Theorem 13.2.2 If

By assumption, B1 (u) = B1 (v) = 0 and B2 (u) = B2 (v) = 0. Therefore
αu(a) + βu0 (a) = 0
αv(a) + βv0 (a) = 0

and

ρu(b) + δu0 (b) = 0
ρv(b) + δv0 (b) = 0.

Since α2 + β 2 > 0 and ρ2 + δ 2 > 0, the determinants of these two systems must both be zero; that is,
u(a)v0 (a) − u0 (a)v(a) = u(b)v0 (b) − u0 (b)v(b) = 0.
This and (13.2.22) imply (13.2.21), which completes the proof.
The next theorem shows that a Sturm–Liouville problem has no complex eigenvalues.

Section 13.2 Sturm-Liouville Problems

Theorem 13.2.3 If λ = p + qi with q 6= 0 then the boundary value problem
Ly + λr(x)y = 0,

B1 (y) = 0,

B2 (y) = 0

has only the trivial solution.
Proof

For this theorem to make sense, we must consider complex-valued solutions of
Ly + (p + iq)r(x, y)y = 0.

(13.2.23)

If y = u + iv where u and v are real-valued and twice differentiable, we define y0 = u0 + iv0 and
y00 = u00 + iv00 . We say that y is a solution of (13.2.23) if the real and imaginary parts of the left side of
(13.2.23) are both zero. Since Ly = (p(x)0 y)0 + q(x)y and p, q, and r are real-valued,
Ly + λr(x)y

=
=

L(u + iv) + (p + iq)r(x)(u + iv)
Lu + r(x)(pu − qv) + i[Lv + r(x)(pu + qv)],

so Ly + λr(x)y = 0 if and only if
Lu + r(x)(pu − qv)
Lv + r(x)(qu + pv)

=

Multiplying the first equation by v and the second by u yields
vLu + r(x)(puv − qv2 )
uLv + r(x)(qu2 + puv)

0.

Subtracting the first equation from the second yields

so
Z

Since

r(x)[u2 (x) + v2 (x)] dx = 0.

(13.2.24)

a

B1 (y) = B1 (u + iv) = B1 (u) + iB1 (v)
and
B2 (y) = B2 (u + iv) = B2 (u) + iB2 (v),
B1 (y) = 0 and B2 (y) = 0 implies that
B1 (u) = B2 (u) = B1 (v) = B2 (v) = 0.
Therefore Theorem 13.2.2 implies that first integral in (13.2.24) equals zero, so (13.2.24) reduces to
q

Z

b

r(x)[u2 (x) + v2 (x)] dx = 0.

a

Since r is positive on [a, b] and q 6= 0 by assumption, this implies that u ≡ 0 and v ≡ 0 on [a, b].
Therefore y ≡ 0 on [a, b], which completes the proof.

Applying variation of parameters to the given initial value problem yields
y = ue−3x, where (A) u0 = 7,

u(0) = 6. Since u00 = 0, Euler’s method yields the exact

solution of (A). Therefore the Euler semilinear method produces the exact solution of the
given problem

3.3.13 (p. 126) Applying variation of parameters to the given initial value problem yields
y = ue−3x , where (A) u0 = 1 − 4x + 3x2 − 4x3 , u(0) = −3. Since u(5) = 0, the Runge-Kutta
method yields the exact solution of (A). Therefore the Euler semilinear method produces the exact
solution of the given problem.
