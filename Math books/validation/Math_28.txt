Note to Students
This book may be different than other mathematics textbooks you have used in
the past. In this book, the reader is expected to do more than read the book and is
expected to study the material in the book by working out examples rather than just
reading about them. So this book is not just about mathematical content but is also
about the process of learning and doing mathematics. Along the way, you will also
learn some important mathematical topics that will help you in your future study
of mathematics.
This book is designed not to be just casually read but rather to be engaged. It
may seem like a clicheÃÅ (because it is in almost every mathematics book now) but
there is truth in the statement that mathematics is not a spectator sport. To learn and
understand mathematics, you must engage in the process of doing mathematics. So
you must actively read and study the book, which means to have a pencil and paper
with you and be willing to follow along and fill in missing details. This type of
engagement is not easy and is often frustrating, but if you do so, you will learn a
great deal about mathematics and more importantly, about doing mathematics.
Recognizing that actively studying a mathematics book is often not easy, several features of the textbook have been designed to help you become more engaged
as you study the material. Some of the features are:
 Beginning Activities. The introductory material in almost every section of
this book contains a so-called beginning activity. Some beginning activities
will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section.
This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses
or it may contain material covered earlier in this text. Other beginning activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will be used later
in that section. It is very important that you work on these beginning activities before starting the rest of the section. Please note that answers to
these beginning activities are not included in the text, but the answers will
be developed in the material later in that section.

Note to Students
 Focus Questions. At the start of each section, we list some focus questions
that provide information about what is important and what ideas are the main
focus of the section. A good goal for studying section is to be able answer
each of the focus questions.
 Progress Checks. Several Progress Checks are included in each section.
These are either short exercises or short activities designed to help you determine if you are understanding the material as you are studying the material
in the section. As such, it is important to work through these progress checks
to test your understanding, and if necessary, study the material again before
proceeding further. So it is important to attempt these progress checks before
checking the answers, which are are provided in Appendix A.
 Section Summaries. To assist you with studying the material in the text,
there is a summary at the end of each of the sections. The summaries usually list the important definitions introduced in the section and the important
results proven in the section. In addition, although not given in a list, the
section summaries should contain answers to the focus questions given at
the beginning of the section.
 Answers for Selected Exercises. Answers or hints for several exercises are
included in an Appendix B. Those exercises with an answer or a hint in the
appendix are preceded by a star .? /.
 Interactive Geogebra Applets. The text contains links to several interactive
Geogebra applets or worksheets. These are active links in the pdf version of
the textbook, so clicking on the link will take you directly to the applet. Short
URL‚Äôs for these links have been created so that they are easier to enter if you
are using a printed copy of the textbook.
Following is a link to the GVSU MTH 123 playlist of Geogebra applets on
the Geogebra website. (MTH 123 is the trigonometry course at Grand Valley
State University.)
http://gvsu.edu/s/Ov
These applets are usually part of a beginning activity or a progress check and
are intended to be used as part of the textbook. See page 15 for an example
of a link to an applet on the Geogebra website. This one is part of Progress
Check 1.6 and is intended to reinforce the unit circle definitions of the cosine
and sine functions.

Preface
This text was written for the three-credit trigonometry course at Grand Valley State
University (MTH 123 ‚Äì Trigonometry). This text begins with a circular function
approach to trigonometry and transitions to the study of triangle trigonometry, vectors, trigonometric identities, and complex numbers.
The authors are very interested in constructive criticism of the textbook from
the users of the book, especially students who are using or have used the book.

Important Features of the Textbook
This book is meant to be used and studied by students and the important features
of the textbook were designed with that in mind. Please see the Note to Students
on page (v) for a description of these features.

Content and Organization
The first two chapters of the textbook emphasize the development of the cosine and
sine functions and how they can be used to model periodic phenomena. The other
four trigonometric functions are studied in Section 1.6 and Section 2.4. Triangles
and vectors are studied in Chapter 3, trigonometric identities and equations are
studied in Chapter 4, and finally, using trigonometry to better understand complex
numbers is in Chapter 5. Following is a more detailed description of the sections
within each chapter.
Chapter 1 ‚Äì The Trigonometric Functions
Section 1.1 introduces the unit circle and the wrapping function for the unit circle.
This develops the important relationship between the real numbers and points on

the unit circle, which leads to the idea of associating intervals of real numbers with
arcs on the unit circle. This is necessary for the development of the cosine and
sine functions in Section 1.2. Understanding the ideas in this section is critical for
proceeding further in the textbook.
The next two sections are intended to provide a rationale as to why we use
radian measure in the development of the trigonometric functions. In addition,
calculators and graphing devices are ubiquitious in the study of mathematics now,
and when we use a calculator, we need to set the angle mode to radians. One of the
purposes of Section 1.3 is to explain to students why we set our calculators to radian
mode. It seems somewhat intellectually dishonest to simply tell students that they
must use radian mode and provide no explanation as to why. Section 1.4 can be
considered an optional section since it is not used later in the textbook. However,
it does provide interesting applications of the use of radian measure when working
with linear and anglular velocity.

 
The common arcs , , and are introduced in Section 1.5. The exact values
6 4
3
of the cosine and sine functions for these arcs are determined using information
about the right triangle with two 45ƒ± angles and the right triangle with angles of
30ƒ± and 60ƒ± . An alternate development of these results using points on the unit
circle and the distance formula is given in Exercises (9) and (10). Section 1.5
concludes with a discussion of the use of reference arcs, and Section 1.6 introduces
the tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions.

Chapter 2 ‚Äì Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions
The first three sections of this chapter deal with the graphs of sinusoidal functions
and their use in modeling periodic phenomena. The graphs of the cosine and sine
functions are developed in Section 2.1 using the unit circle. Geogebra applets are
used in this development. Section 2.2 deals with the graphs of sinusoidal functions
of the form y D A sin.B.x C // C D or y D A cos.B.x C // C D. In this section, it is emphasized that the amplitude, period, and vertical shift for a sinusoidal
function is independent of whether a sine or cosine is used. The difference in using
a sine or cosine will be the phase shift. Sinusoidal models of periodic phenomena
are discussed in Section 2.3. With the use of technology, it is now possible to do
sine regressions. Although the textbook is relatively independent of the choice of
technology, instructions for doing sine regressions using Geogebra are given in this
section.
The graphs of the other four trigonometric functions are developed in Section 2.4. Most of this section can be considered as optional, but it is important to

x

Preface

at least discuss the material related to the graph of the tangent function since the
inverse tangent function is part of Section 2.5. The inverse sine functionand inverse
cosine function are, of course, also developed in this section. In order to show how
inverse functions can be used in mathematics, solutions of trigonometric equations
are studied in Section 2.6.
Chapter 3 ‚Äì Triangles and Vectors
This chapter contains the usual material dealing with triangle trigonometry including right triangle trigonometry, the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines, which are
both handled in Section 3.3. The emphasis in this section is how to use these two
laws to solve problems involving triangles. By having them both in the same section, students can get practice deciding which law to use for a particular problem.
The proofs of these two laws are included as appendices for Section 3.3.
More work with the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines is included in Section 3.4. In addition, this section contains problems dealing with the area of a
triangle including Heron‚Äôs formula for the area of a triangle. (The proof of Heron‚Äôs
formula is also in an appendix at the end of the section.)
The last two sections of this chapter deal with vectors. Section 3.5 deals with
the geometry of vectors, and Section 3.6 deals with vectors from an algebraic point
of view.
Chapter 4 ‚Äì Identities and Equations
The first section of this chapter introduces the concept of a trigonometric identity.
The emphasis is on how to verify or prove an identity and how to show that an
equation is not an identity. The second section reviews and continues the work on
trigonometric equations from Section 2.6.
The last three sections of the chapter cover the usual trigonometric identities
in this type of course. In addition, the sections show how identities can be used to
help solve equations.
Chapter 5 ‚Äì Complex Numbers
It is assumed that students have worked with complex numbers before. However,
Section 5.1 provides a good summary of previous work with complex numbers. In
addition, this section introduces the geometric representation of complex numbers
in the complex plane. Section 5.2 introduces the trigonometric or polar form of a
complex number including the rules for multiplying and dividing complex numbers

in trigonometric form. Section 5.3 contains the material dealing with DeMoivre‚Äôs
Theorem about the powers of complex numbers and includes material on how to
find roots of complex numbers.

Chapter 1

The Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometry had its start as the study of triangles. The study of triangles can be
traced back to the second millenium B.C.E. in Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics. In fact, the word trigonmetry is derived from a Greek word meaning ‚Äútriangle
measuring.‚Äù We will study the trigonometry of triangles in Chapter 3. Today,
however, the trigonometric functions are used in more ways. In particular, the
trigonometric functions can be used to model periodic phenomena such as sound
and light waves, the tides, the number of hours of daylight per day at a particular
location on earth, and many other phenomena that repeat values in specified time
intervals.
Our study of periodic phenomena will begin in Chapter 2, but first we must
study the trigonometric functions. To do so, we will use the basic form of a repeating (or periodic) phenomena of travelling around a circle at a constant rate.

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

1.1

The Unit Circle

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What is the unit circle and why is it important in trigonmetry? What is
the equation for the unit circle?
 What is meant by ‚Äúwrapping the number line around the unit circle?‚Äù
How is this used to identify real numbers as the lengths of arcs on the
unit circle?
 How do we associate an arc on the unit circle with a closed interval of
real numbers?

Beginning Activity
As has been indicated, one of the primary reasons we study the trigonometric functions is to be able to model periodic phenomena mathematically. Before we begin
our mathematical study of periodic phenomena, here is a little ‚Äúthought experiment‚Äù to consider.
Imagine you are standing at a point on a circle and you begin walking around
the circle at a constant rate in the counterclockwise direction. Also assume that
it takes you four minutes to walk completely around the circle one time. Now
suppose you are at a point P on this circle at a particular time t .
 Describe your position on the circle 2 minutes after the time t .
 Describe your position on the circle 4 minutes after the time t .
 Describe your position on the circle 6 minutes after the time t .
 Describe your position on the circle 8 minutes after the time t .
The idea here is that your position on the circle repeats every 4 minutes. After 2
minutes, you are at a point diametrically opposed from the point you started. After

1.1. The Unit Circle

3

4 minutes, you are back at your starting point. In fact, you will be back at your
starting point after 8 minutes, 12 minutes, 16 minutes, and so on. This is the idea
of periodic behavior.

The Unit Circle and the Wrapping Function
In order to model periodic phenomena mathematically, we will need functions that
are themselves periodic. In other words, we look for functions whose values repeat
in regular and recognizable patterns. Familiar functions like polynomials and exponential functions don‚Äôt exhibit periodic behavior, so we turn to the trigonometric
functions. Before we can define these functions, however, we need a way to introduce periodicity. We do so in a manner similar to the thought experiment, but we
also use mathematical objects and equations. The primary tool is something called
the wrapping function. Instead of using any circle, we will use the so-called unit
circle. This is the circle whose center is at the origin and whose radius is equal to
1, and the equation for the unit circle is x 2 C y 2 D 1.

Figure 1.1: Setting up to wrap the number line around the unit circle
Figure 1.1 shows the unit circle with a number line drawn tangent to the circle
at the point .1; 0/. We will ‚Äúwrap‚Äù this number line around the unit circle. Unlike
the number line, the length once around the unit circle is finite. (Remember that
the formula for the circumference of a circle as 2 r where r is the radius, so the
length once around the unit circle is 2). However, we can still measure distances
and locate the points on the number line on the unit circle by wrapping the number
line around the circle. We wrap the positive part of this number line around the
circumference of the circle in a counterclockwise fashion and wrap the negative

4

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

part of the number line around the circumference of the unit circle in a clockwise
direction.
Two snapshots of an animation of this process for the counterclockwise wrap
are shown in Figure 1.2 and two such snapshots are shown in Figure 1.3 for the
clockwise wrap.

Figure 1.2: Wrapping the positive number line around the unit circle

Figure 1.3: Wrapping the negative number line around the unit circle
Following is a link to an actual animation of this process, including both positive wraps and negative wraps.
http://gvsu.edu/s/Kr
Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3 only show a portion of the number line being wrapped
around the circle. Since the number line is infinitely long, it will wrap around

1.1. The Unit Circle

5

the circle infinitely many times. A result of this is that infinitely many different
numbers from the number line get wrapped to the same location on the unit circle.
 The number 0 and the numbers 2, 2, and 4 (as well as others) get
wrapped to the point .1; 0/. We will usually say that these points get mapped
to the point .1; 0/.

 The number
is mapped to the point .0; 1/. This is because the circum2
ference of the unit circle is 2 and so one-fourth of the circumference is


.2/ D .

 If we now add 2 to , we see that
also gets mapped to .0; 1/. If we
2
2

3
subtract 2 from , we see that
also gets mapped to .0; 1/.
2
2
However, the fact that infinitely many different numbers from the number line get
wrapped to the same location on the unit circle turns out to be very helpful as it
will allow us to model and represent behavior that repeats or is periodic in nature.
Progress Check 1.1 (The Unit Circle.)
1. Find two different numbers, one positive and one negative, from the number
line that get wrapped to the point . 1; 0/ on the unit circle.
2. Describe all of the numbers on the number line that get wrapped to the point
. 1; 0/ on the unit circle.
3. Find two different numbers, one positive and one negative, from the number
line that get wrapped to the point .0; 1/ on the unit circle.
4. Find two different numbers, one positive and one negative, from the number
line that get wrapped to the point .0; 1/ on the unit circle.
One thing we should see from our work in Progress Check 1.1 is that integer
multiples of  are wrapped either to the point .1; 0/ or . 1; 0/ and that odd inte
ger multiples of
are wrapped to either to the point .0; 1/ or .0; 1/. Since the
2
circumference of the unit circle is 2, it is not surprising that fractional parts of 
and the integer multiples of these fractional parts of  can be located on the unit
circle. This will be studied in the next progress check.

Arcs on the Unit Circle
When we wrap the number line around the unit circle, any closed interval on the
number line gets mapped to a continuous piece of thehunit circle.
These pieces
i
are called arcs of the circle. For example, the segment 0;
on the number line
2
gets mapped to the arc connecting the points .1; 0/ and .0; 1/ on the unit circle as
shown in Figure 1.5. In general, when a closed interval ≈ía; b¬ç is mapped to an arc
on the unit circle, the point corresponding to t D a is called the initial point of
the arc, and the point corresponding to t D b is called
terminal point of the
h the
i
arc. So the arc corresponding to the closed interval 0;
has initial point .1; 0/

Coordinates of Points on the Unit Circle
When we have an equation (usually in terms of x and y) for a curve in the plane and
we know one of the coordinates of a point on that curve, we can use the equation
to determine the other coordinate for the point on the curve. The equation for the
unit circle is x 2 C y 2 D 1. So if we know one of the two coordinates of a point
on the unit circle, we can substitute that value into the equation and solve for the
value(s) of the other variable.
For example, suppose we know that the x-coordinate of a point on the unit
1
. This is illustrated on the following diagram. This diagram shows

the unit circle (x 2 C y 2 D 1) and the vertical line x D

there are two points on the unit circle whose x-coordinate is

the y-coordinates by substituting the x-value into the equation and solving for y.

Summary of Section 1.1
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:
 The unit circle is the circle of radius 1 that is centered at the origin. The
equation of the unit circle is x 2 C y 2 D 1. It is important because we will
use this as a tool to model periodic phenomena.
 We ‚Äúwrap‚Äù the number line about the unit circle by drawing a number line
that is tangent to the unit circle at the point .1; 0/. We wrap the positive part
of the number line around the unit circle in the counterclockwise direction
and wrap the negative part of the number line around the unit circle in the
clockwise direction.
 When we wrap the number line around the unit circle, any closed interval of
real numbers gets mapped to a continuous piece of the unit circle, which is
called an arc of the circle. When the closed interval ≈ía; b¬ç is mapped to an
arc on the unit circle, the point correpsonding to t D a is called the initial
point of the arc, and the point corresponding to t D b is called the terminal
point of the arc.

The Cosine and Sine Functions
We started our study of trigonometry by learning about the unit circle, how to
wrap the number line around the unit circle, and how to construct arcs on the unit
circle. We are now able to use these ideas to define the two major circular, or
trigonmetric, functions. These circular functions will allow us to model periodic
phenomena such as tides, the amount of sunlight during the days of the year, orbits
of planets, and many others.
It may seem like the unit circle is a fairly simple object and of little interest, but
mathematicians can almost always find something fascinating in even such simple
objects. For example, we define the two major circular functions, the cosine and
sine1 in terms of the unit circle as follows. Figure 1.6 shows an arc of length t on
the unit circle. This arc begins at the point .1; 0/ and ends at its terminal point P .t /.
We then define the cosine and sine of the arc t as the x and y coordinates of the
point P , so that P .t / D .cos.t /; sin.t // (we abbreviate the cosine as cos and the
sine as sin). So the cosine and sine values are determined by the arc t and the cosine

Figure 1.6: The Circular Functions
1 According to the web site Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics at
http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html, the origin of the word sine is Sanskrit
through Arabic and Latin. While the accounts of the actual origin differ, it appears that the Sanskrit
work ‚Äújya‚Äù (chord) was taken into Arabic as ‚Äújiba‚Äù, but was then translated into Latin as ‚Äújaib‚Äù (bay)
which became ‚Äúsinus‚Äù (bay or curve). This word was then anglicized to become our ‚Äúsine‚Äù. The
word cosine began with Plato of Tivoli who use the expression ‚Äúchorda residui‚Äù. While the Latin
word chorda was a better translation of the Sanskrit-Arabic word for sine than the word sinus, that
word was already in use. Thus, ‚Äúchorda residui‚Äù became ‚Äúcosine‚Äù.

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

and sine are functions of the arc t . Since the arc lies on the unit circle, we call the
cosine and sine circular functions. An important part of trigonometry is the study
of the cosine and sine and the periodic phenomena that these functions can model.
This is one reason why the circular functions are also called the trigonometric
functions.
Note: In mathematics, we always create formal definitions for objects we commonly use. Definitions are critically important because with agreed upon definitions, everyone will have a common understanding of what the terms mean. Without such a common understanding, there would be a great deal of confusion since
different people who have different meanings for various terms. So careful and
precise definitions are necessary in order to develop mathematical properties of
these objects. In order to learn and understand trigonometry, a person needs to be
able to explain how the circular functions are defined. So now is a good time to
start working on understanding these definitions.
Definition. If the real number t is the directed length of an arc (either positive
or negative) measured on the unit circle x 2 C y 2 D 1 (with counterclockwise
as the positive direction) with initial point (1, 0) and terminal point .x; y/,
then the cosine of t , denoted cos.t /, and sine of t , denoted sin.t /, are defined
to be
cos.t / D x
and
sin.t / D y:
Figure 1.6 illustrates these definitions for an arc whose terminal point is in the
first quadrant.
At this time, it is not possible to determine the exact values of the cosine and
sine functions for specific values of t . It can be done, however, if the terminal
point of an arc of length t lies on the x-axis or the y-axis. For example, since the
circumference of the unit circle is 2, an arc of length t D  will have it terminal
point half-way around the circle from the point .1; 0/. That is, the terminal point is
at . 1; 0/. Therefore,
cos./ D

sin./ D 0:

Important Note: Since the cosine and sine are functions of an arc whose length
is the real number t , the input t determines the output of the cosine and sin. As a
result, it is necessary to specify the input value when working with the cosine and
sine. In other words, we ALWAYS write cos.t / where t is the real number input,
and NEVER just cos. To reiterate, the cosine and sine are functions, so we MUST
indicate the input to these functions.
Progress Check 1.6 (Approximating Cosine and Sine Values).
For this progress check, we will use the Geogebra Applet called Terminal Points of
Arcs on the Unit Circle. A web address for this applet is
http://gvsu.edu/s/JY
For this applet, we control the value of the input t with the slider for t . The values
of t range from 20 to 20 in increments of 0:5. For a given value of t , an arc is
drawn of length t and the coordinates of the terminal point of that arc are displayed.

2. cos.2/ and sin.2/.

5. cos.15/ and sin.15/.

3. cos. 4/ and sin. 4/.

6. cos. 15/ and sin. 15/.

Some Properties of the Cosine and Sine Functions
The cosine and sine functions are called circular functions because their values
are determined by the coordinates of points on the unit circle. For each real number
t , there is a corresponding arc starting at the point .1; 0/ of (directed) length t that
lies on the unit circle. The coordinates of the end point of this arc determines the
values of cos.t / and sin.t /.
In previous mathematics courses, we have learned that the domain of a function
is the set of all inputs that give a defined output. We have also learned that the range
of a function is the set of all possible outputs of the function.

What is the smallest y coordinate that a point on the unit circle can have?

Although we may not be able to calculate the exact values for many inputs for
the cosine and sine functions, we can use our knowledge of the coordinate system
and its quadrants to determine if certain values of cosine and sine are positive or
negative. The idea is that the signs of the coordinates of a point P .x; y/ that is
plotted in the coordinate plan are determined by the quadrant in which the point
lies. (Unless it lies on one of the axes.) Figure 1.7 summarizes these results for the
signs of the cosine and sine function values. The left column in the table is for the

What we need to do now is to determine in which quadrant the terminal point

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

The Pythagorean Identity
In mathematics, an identity is a statement that is true for all values of the variables for which it is defined. In previous courses, we have worked with algebraic
identities such as
7x C 12x D 19x
a

b D .a C b/.a

aCb D bCa

x.y C z/ D xy C xz

where it is understood that all the variables represent real numbers. In trigonometry, we will develop many so-called trigonometric identities. The following progress
check introduces one such identity between the cosine and sine functions.
Progress Check 1.10 (Introduction to the Pythagorean Identity)
We know that the equation for the unit circle is x 2 C y 2 D 1. We also know that if
t is an real number, then the terminal point of the arc determined by t is the point
.cos.t /; sin.t // and that this point lies on the unit circle. Use this information to
develop an identity involving cos.t / and sin.t /.
Using the definitions x D cos.t / and y D sin.t / along with the equation for
the unit circle, we obtain the following identity, which is perhaps the most
important trigonometric identity.
For each real number t; ..cos.t //2 C .sin.t //2 D 1:
This is called the Pythagorean Identity. We often use the shorthand notation cos2 .t / for .cos.t //2 and sin2 .t / for .sin.t //2 and write
For each real number t; cos2 .t / C sin2 .t / D 1:
Important Note about Notation. Always remember that by cos2 .t / we mean
.cos.t //2 . In addition, note that cos2 .t / is different from cos.t 2 /.
The Pythagorean Identity allows us to determine the value of cos.t / or sin.t / if
we know the value of the other one and the quadrant in which the terminal point of
arc t lies. This is illustrated in the next example.
Example 1.11 (Using the Pythagorean Identity)
2
Assume that cos.t / D and the terminal point of arc .t / lies in the fourth quadrant.

We will use this information to determine the value of sin.t /. The primary tool we
will use is the Pythagorean Identity, but please keep in mind that the terminal point

for the arc t is the point .cos.t /; sin.t //. That is, x D cos.t / and y D sin.t /. So
this problem is very similar to using the equation x 2 C y 2 D 1 for the unit circle

Introduction
The ancient civilization known as Babylonia was a cultural region based in southern Mesopatamia, which is present-day Iraq. Babylonia emerged as an independent
state around 1894 BCE. The Babylonians developed a system of mathematics that
was based on a sexigesimal (base 60) number system. This was the origin of the
modern day usage of 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute, and 360 degrees in a circle.
Many historians now believe that for the ancient Babylonians, the year consisted of 360 days, which is not a bad approximation given the crudeness of the
ancient astronomical tools. As a consequence, they divided the circle into 360
equal length arcs, which gave them a unit angle that was 1/360 of a circle or what
we now know as a degree. Even though there are 365.24 days in a year, the Babylonian unit angle is still used as the basis for measuring angles in a circle. Figure 1.8
shows a circle divided up into 6 angles of 60 degrees each, which is also something
that fit nicely with the Babylonian base-60 number system.

We often denote a line that is drawn through 2 points A and B by AB. The portion
!
of the line AB that starts at the point A and continues indefinitely in the direction
!
of the point B is called ray AB and is denoted by AB. The point A is the initial
!
point of the ray AB. An angle is formed by rotating a ray about its endpoint. The
ray in its initial position is called the initial side of the angle, and the position of
the ray after it has been rotated is called the terminal side of the ray. The endpoint
of the ray is called the vertex of the angle.

!
Figure 1.9 shows the ray AB rotated about the point A to form an angle. The
!
terminal side of the angle is the ray AC . We often refer to this as angle BAC ,
which is abbreviated as ‚Ä†BAC . We can also refer to this angle as angle CAB or
‚Ä†CAB. If we want to use a single letter for this angle, we often use a Greek letter
such as Àõ (alpha). We then just say the angle Àõ. Other Greek letters that are often
used are Àá (beta), (gamma),  (theta),  (phi), and  (rho).

Arcs and Angles
To define the trigonometric functions in terms of angles, we will make a simple
connection between angles and arcs by using the so-called standard position of an
angle. When the vertex of an angle is at the origin in the xy-plane and the initial
side lies along the positive x-axis, we see that the angle is in standard position.
The terminal side of the angle is then in one of the four quadrants or lies along one
of the axes. When the terminal side is in one of the four quadrants, the terminal
side determines the so-called quadrant designation of the angle. See Figure 1.10.

Progress Check 1.13 (Angles in Standard Position)
Draw an angle in standard position in (1) the first quadrant; (2) the third quadrant;
and (3) the fourth quadrant.
If an angle is in standard position, then the point where the terminal side of
the angle intersects the unit circle marks the terminal point of an arc as shown in
Figure 1.11. Similarly, the terminal point of an arc on the unit circle determines
a ray through the origin and that point, which in turn defines an angle in standard
position. In this case we say that the angle is subtended by the arc. So there is
a natural correspondence between arcs on the unit circle and angles in standard
position. Because of this correspondence, we can also define the trigonometric

functions in terms of angles as well as arcs. Before we do this, however, we need
to discuss two different ways to measure angles.

it inches, centimeters, or something else). As mentioned in the introduction, the
Babylonians divided the circle into 360 regions. So one complete wrap around
a circle is 360 degrees, denoted 360ƒ±. The unit measure of 1ƒ± is an angle that
is 1=360 of the central angle of a circle. Figure 1.8 shows 6 angles of 60ƒ± each.
The degree ƒ± is a dimension, just like a length. So to compare an angle measured
in degrees to an arc measured with some kind of length, we need to connect the
dimensions. We can do that with the radian measure of an angle.
Radians will be useful in that a radian is a dimensionless measurement. We
want to connect angle measurements to arc measurements, and to do so we will
directly define an angle of 1 radian to be an angle subtended by an arc of length 1
(the length of the radius) on the unit circle as shown in Figure 1.12.
Definition. An angle of one radian is the angle in standard position on the
unit circle that is subtended by an arc of length 1 (in the positive direction).
This directly connects angles measured in radians to arcs in that we associate
a real number with both the arc and the angle. So an angle of 2 radians cuts off an
arc of length 2 on the unit circle, an angle of 3 radians cuts of an arc of length 3
on the unit circle, and so on. Figure 1.13 shows the terminal sides of angles with
measures of 0 radians, 1 radian, 2 radians, 3 radians, 4 radians, 5 radians, and 6
radians. Notice that 2  6:2832 and so 6 < 2 as shown in Figure 1.13.

We can also have angles whose radian measure is negative just like we have arcs
with a negative length. The idea is simply to measure in the negative (clockwise)
direction around the unit circle. So an angle whose measure is 1 radian is the
angle in standard position on the unit circle that is subtended by an arc of length 1
in the negative (clockwise) direction.
So in general, an angle (in standard position) of t radians will correspond to an
arc of length t on the unit circle. This allows us to discuss the sine and cosine of
an angle measured in radians. That is, when we think of sin.t / and cos.t /, we can
consider t to be:
 a real number;
 the length of an arc with initial point .1; 0/ on the unit circle;
 the radian measure of an angle in standard position.
When we draw a picture of an angle in standard position, we often draw a small
arc near the vertex from the initial side to the terminal side as shown in Figure 1.14,
3
which shows an angle whose measure is  radians.

Conversion Between Radians and Degrees
Radian measure is the preferred measure of angles in mathematics for many reasons, the main one being that a radian has no dimensions. However, to effectively
use radians, we will want to be able to convert angle measurements between radians and degrees.
Recall that one wrap of the unit circle corresponds to an arc of length 2, and
an arc of length 2 on the unit circle corresponds to an angle of 2 radians. An
angle of 360ƒ± is also an angle that wraps once around the unit circle, so an angle
of 360ƒ± is equivalent to an angle of 2 radians, or
 each degree is


radians,
180

 each radian is

180
degrees.


30

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

180
Notice that 1 radian is then
 57:3ƒ± , so a radian is quite large compared to

a degree. These relationships allow us to quickly convert between degrees and
radians. For example:
 If an angle has a degree measure of 35 degrees, then its radian measure can
be calculated as follows:
35 degrees 

 radians
35
D
radians:
180 degrees
180

Rewriting this fraction, we see that an angle with a measure of 35 degrees
7
has a radian measure of
radians.
36
3
radians, then its degree measure can
 If an angle has a radian measure of
10
be calculated as follows:
3
180 degrees

D

10
So an angle with a radian measure of

3
has an angle measure of 54ƒ± .
10

IMPORTANT NOTE: Since a degree is a dimension, we MUST include the degree mark ƒ± whenever we write the degree measure of an angle. A radian has no
dimension so there is no dimension mark to go along with it. Consequently, if we
write 2 for the measure of an angle we understand that the angle is measured in
radians. If we really mean an angle of 2 degrees, then we must write 2ƒ± .

Complete the following table to convert from degrees to radians and vice versa.

Calculators and the Trignometric Functions
We have now seen that when we think of sin.t / or cos.t /, we can think of t as a real
number, the length of an arc, or the radian measure of an angle. In Section 1.5, we

approximate the values of the circular (or trigonometric)functions. Most hand-held
calculators, calculators in phone or tablet apps, and online calculators have a cosine
key and a sine key that you can use to approximate values of these functions, but
we must keep in mind that the calculator only provides an approximation of the
value, not the exact value (except for a small collection of arcs). In addition, most
calculators will approximate the sine and cosine of angles.
To do this, the calculator has two modes for angles: Radian and Degree. Because of the correspondence between real numbers, length of arcs, and radian measures of angles, for now, we will always put our calculators in radian mode. In
fact, we have seen that an angle measured in radians subtends an arc of that radian
measure along the unit circle. So the cosine or sine of an angle measure in radians is the same thing as the cosine or sine of a real number when that real
number is interpreted as the length of an arc along the unit circle. (When we
study the trigonometry of triangles in Chapter 3, we will use the degree mode. For
an introductory discussion of the trigonometric functions of an angle measure in

Progress Check 1.16 (Using a Calculator)
In Progress Check 1.6, we used the Geogebra Applet called Terminal Points of

sin.2/  0:9093.

 cos. 15/  0:7597
sin. 15/  0:6503.

Use a calculator to determine these values of the cosine and sine functions and
compare the values to the ones above. Are they the same? How are they different?

Summary of Section 1.3
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:
 An angle is formed by rotating a ray about its endpoint. The ray in its initial
position is called the initial side of the angle, and the position of the ray after
it has been rotated is called the terminal side of the ray. The endpoint of the
ray is called the vertex of the angle.
 When the vertex of an angle is at the origin in the xy-plane and the initial side
lies along the positive x-axis, we see that the angle is in standard position.
 There are two ways to measure angles. For degree meausre, one complete
wrap around a circle is 360 degrees, denoted 360ƒ± . The unit measure of 1ƒ±
is an angle that is 1=360 of the central angle of a circle. An angle of one
radian is the angle in standard position on the unit circle that is subtended
by an arc of length 1 (in the positive direction).
 We convert the measure of an angle from degrees to radians by using the fact

that each degree is
radians. We convert the measure of an angle from
180
180
radians to degrees by using the fact that each radian is
degrees.

4. In Progess Check 1.16, we used the Geogebra Applet called Terminal Points
of Arcs on the Unit Circle to approximate values of the cosine and sine functions. We will now do something similar to approximate the cosine and sine
values for angles measured in degrees.
We have seen that the terminal side of an angle in standard position intersects
the unit circle in a point. We use the coordinates of this point to determine
the cosine and sine of that angle. When the angle is measured in radians, the
radian measure of the angle is the same as the arc on the unit circle substended by the angle. This is not true when the angle is measure in degrees,
but we can still use the intersection point to define the cosine and sine of the
angle. So if an angle in standard position has degree measurement aƒ± , then
we define cos.aƒ± / to be the x-coordinate of the point of intersection of the
terminal side of that angle and the unit circle. We define sin.aƒ± / to be the

34

y-coordinate of the point of intersection of the terminal side of that angle
and the unit circle.

For this applet, we control the value of the input aƒ± with the slider for a.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What is arc length?
 What is the difference between linear velocity and angular velocity?
 What are the formulas that relate linear velocity to angular velocity?

Beginning Activity
1. What is the formula for the circumference C of a circle whose radius is r?
2. Suppose person A walks along the circumference of a circle with a radius
of 10 feet, and person B walks along the circumference of a circle of radius
20 feet. Also, suppose it takes both A and B 1 minute to walk one-quarter
of the circumference of their respective circles (one-quarter of a complete
revolution). Who walked the most distance?
3. Suppose both people continue walking at the same pace they did for the first
minute. How many complete revolutions of the circle will each person walk
in 8 minutes? In 10 minutes?

Arc Length on a Circle
In Section 1.3, we learned that the radian measure of an angle was equal to the
length of the arc on the unit circle associated with that angle. So an arc of length
1 on the unit circle subtends an angle of 1 radian. There will be times when it will
also be useful to know the length of arcs on other circles that subtend the same
angle.
In Figure 1.15, the inner circle has a radius of 1, the outer circle has a radius of
r, and the angle shown has a measure of  radians. So the arc length on the unit

circle subtended by the angle is  , and we have used s to represent the arc length
on the circle of radius r subtended by the angle.
Recall that the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2 r while the circumference of the circle of radius 1 is 2. Therefore, the ratio of an arc length s on the
circle of radius r that subtends an angle of  radians to the corresponding arc on
2 r
the unit circle is

the central angle in radians.
2 It

is not clear why the letter s is usually used to represent arc length. One explanation is that the
arc ‚Äúsubtends‚Äù an angle.

Progress Check 1.17 (Using the Formula for Arc Length)
Using the circles in the beginning activity for this section:
1. Use the formula for arc length to determine the arc length on a circle of

radius 10 feet that subtends a central angle of radians. Is the result equal
2

2. Use the formula for arc length to determine the arc length on a circle of

radius 20 feet that subtends a central angle of radians. Is the result equal
2
to one-quarter of the circumference of the circle?
3. Determine the arc length on a circle of radius 3 feet that is subtended by an
angle of 22ƒ± .

Why Radians?
Degree measure is familiar and convenient, so why do we introduce the unit of
radian? This is a good question, but one with a subtle answer. As we just saw, the
length s of an arc on a circle of radius r subtended by angle of  radians is given
s
by s D r , so  D . As a result, a radian measure is a ratio of two lengths (the
r
quotient of the length of an arc by a radius of a circle), which makes radian measure a dimensionless quantity. Thus, a measurement in radians can just be thought
of as a real number. This is convenient for dealing with arc length (and angular
velocity as we will soon see), and it will also be useful when we study periodic
phenomena in Chapter 2. For this reason radian measure is universally used in
mathematics, physics, and engineering as opposed to degrees, because when we
use degree measure we always have to take the degree dimension into account in
computations. This means that radian measure is actually more natural from a
mathematical standpoint than degree measure.

Linear and Angular Velocity
The connection between an arc on a circle and the angle it subtends measured
in radians allows us to define quantities related to motion on a circle. Objects
traveling along circular paths exhibit two types of velocity: linear and angular
velocity. Think of spinning on a merry-go-round. If you drop a pebble off the
edge of a moving merry-go-round, the pebble will not drop straight down. Instead,
it will continue to move forward with the velocity the merry-go-round had the

38

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

moment the pebble was released. This is the linear velocity of the pebble. The
linear velocity measures how the arc length changes over time.
Consider a point P moving at a constant velocity along the circumference of a
circle of radius r. This is called uniform circular motion. Suppose that P moves
a distance of s units in time t . The linear velocity v of the point P is the distance
s
it travelled divided by the time elapsed. That is, v D . The distance s is the arc
t
length and we know that s D r .
Definition. Consider a point P moving at a constant velocity along the circumference of a circle of radius r. The linear velocity v of the point P is
given by
s
r
vD D
;
t
t
where  , measured in radians, is the central angle subtended by the arc of
length s.
Another way to measure how fast an object is moving at a constant speed on a
circular path is called angular velocity. Whereas the linear velocity measures how
the arc length changes over time, the angular velocity is a measure of how fast the
central angle is changing over time.
Definition. Consider a point P moving with constant velocity along the circumference of a circle of radius r on an arc that corresponds to a central angle
of measure  (in radians). The angular velocity ! of the point is the radian
measure of the angle  divided by the time t it takes to sweep out this angle.
That is

!D :
t

Note: The symbol ! is the lower case Greek letter ‚Äúomega.‚Äù Also, notice that the
angular velocity does not depend on the radius r.
This is a somewhat specialized definition of angular velocity that is slightly
different than a common term used to describe how fast a point is revolving around
a circle. This term is revolutions per minute or rpm. Sometimes the unit revolutions per second is used. A better way to represent revolutions per minute is to use
rev
the ‚Äúunit fraction‚Äù
. Since 1 revolution is 2 radians, we see that if an object

The purpose of the beginning activity was to show that we determine the values
of cosine and sine for the other arcs by finding only the cosine and sine values for
the arcs whose terminal points are in the first quadrant. So this is our first task. To
do this, we will rely on some facts about certain right triangles. The three triangles
we will use are shown in Figure 1.18.

Figure 1.18: Special Right Triangles.

In each figure, the hypotenuse of the right triangle has a length of c units.
The lengths of the other sides are determined using the Pythagorean Theorem. An
explanation of how these lengths were determined can be found on page 420 in
Appendix C. The usual convention is to use degree measure for angles when we
work with triangles, but we can easily convert these degree measures to radian
measures.

Reference Arcs (Reference Angles)
In the beginning activity for this section and in Progress Checks 1.21 and 1.22, we
saw that we could relate the coordinates of the terminal point of an arc of length

greater than on the unit circle to the coordinates of the terminal point of an arc
2

on the unit circle. This was intended to show that we
of length between 0 and
2

can do this for any angle of length greater than , and this means that if we know
2

the values of the cosine and sine for any arc (or angle) between 0 and , then we
2
can find the values of the cosine and sine for any arc at all. The arc between 0 and


to which we relate a given arc of length greater than is called a reference arc.
2
2
Definition. The reference arc tO for an arc t is the smallest non-negative
arc (always considered non-negative) between the terminal point of the arc
t and the closer of the two x-intercepts of the unit circle. Note that the two
x-intercepts of the unit circle are . 1; 0/ and .1; 0/.

52

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

The concept of reference arc is illustrated in Figure 1.22. Each of the thicker
arcs has length tO and it can be seen that the coordinates of the points in the second,
third, and fourth quadrants are all related to the coordinates of the point in the first
quadrant. The signs of the coordinates are all determined by the quadrant in which
the point lies.

Figure 1.22: Reference arcs.

How we calculate a reference arc for a given arc of length t depends upon
the quadrant in which the terminal point of t lies. The diagrams in Figure 1.23
illustrate how to calculate the reference arc for an arc of length t with 0  t  2.
In Figure 1.23, we see that for an arc of length t with 0  t  2:

< t < , then the point intersecting the unit circle and the x axis that
2
is closest to the terminal point of t is . 1; 0/. So the reference arc is  t .
In this case, Figure 1.23 shows that

Reference Arcs for Negative Arcs
Up to now, we have only discussed reference arcs for positive arcs, but the same
principles apply when we use negative arcs. Whether the arc t is positive or negative, the reference arc for t is the smallest non-negative arc formed by the terminal
point of t and the nearest x-intercept of the unit circle. For example, for the arc

tD
is in the fourth quadrant, and the closer of the two x-intercepts of the unit
4

circle is .1; 0/. So the reference arc is tO D as shown in Figure 1.24.

Summary of Section 1.5
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:

the coordinate axes are shown in Table 1.3 below.

 A reference arc for an arc t is the arc (always considered nonnegative) between the terminal point of the arc t and point intersecting the unit circle and
the x-axis closest to it.
 If t is an arc that has an arc tO as a reference arc, then j cos.t /j and j cos.tO/j are
the same. Whether cos.t / D cos.tO/ or cos.t / D cos.tO/ is determined by
the quadrant in which the terminal side of t lies. The same is true for sin.t /.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 How is the tangent function defined? What is the domain of the tangent
function?
 What are the reciprocal functions and how are they defined? What are
the domains of each of the reciprocal functions?
We defined the cosine and sine functions as the coordinates of the terminal
points of arcs on the unit circle. As we will see later, the sine and cosine give
relations for certain sides and angles of right triangles. It will be useful to be able
to relate different sides and angles in right triangles, and we need other circular
functions to do that. We obtain these other circular functions ‚Äì tangent, cotangent,
secant, and cosecant ‚Äì by combining the cosine and sine together in various ways.

Beginning Activity
Using radian measure:
1. For what values of t is cos.t / D 0?
2. For what values of t is sin.t / D 0?
3. In what quadrants is cos.t / > 0? In what quadrants is sin.t / > 0?
4. In what quadrants is cos.t / < 0? In what quadrants is sin.t / < 0?

The Tangent Function
Next to the cosine and sine, the most useful circular function is the tangent.3
3 The word tangent was introduced by Thomas Fincke (1561-1656) in his Flenspurgensis Geome-

triae rotundi libri XIIII where he used the word tangens in Latin. From ‚ÄúEarliest Known Uses of
Some of the Words of Mathematics at http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html.

Chapter 1. The Trigonometric Functions

Definition. The tangent function is the quotient of the sine function divided
by the cosine function. So the tangent of a real number t is defined to be
sin.t /
for those values t for which cos.t / ¬§ 0. The common abbreviation for
cos.t /
the tangent of t is
sin.t /
tan.t / D
:
cos.t /
In this definition, we need the restriction that cos.t / ¬§ 0 to make sure the

quotient is defined. Since cos.t / D 0 whenever t D C k for some integer k,
2

we see that tan.t / is defined when t ¬§ C k for all integers k. So
2
The domain of the tangent function is the set of all real numbers t for

which t ¬§ C k for every integer k.
2
Notice that although the domain of the sine and cosine functions is all real numbers,
this is not true for the tangent function.
When we worked with the unit circle definitions of cosine and sine, we often
used the following diagram to indicate signs of cos.t / and sin.t / when the terminal
point of the arc t is in a given quadrant.
cos (t) < 0

sin (t) > 0

The Reciprocal Functions
The remaining circular or trigonometric functions are reciprocals of the cosine,
sine, and tangent functions. Since these functions are reciprocals, their domains
will be all real numbers for which the denominator is not equal to zero. The first
we will introduce is the secantfunction. 4 function.
Definition. The secant function is the reciprocal of the cosine function. So
1
for those values t where
the secant of a real number t is defined to be
cos.t /
cos.t / ¬§ 0. The common abbreviation for the secant of t is
sec.t / D

1
:
cos.t /

Since the tangent function and the secant function use cos.t / in a denominator,
they have the same domain. So
4 The term secant was introduced by was by Thomas Fincke (1561-1656) in his Thomae Finkii
Flenspurgensis Geometriae rotundi libri XIIII, Basileae: Per Sebastianum Henricpetri, 1583. Vieta
(1593) did not approve of the term secant, believing it could be confused with the geometry term.
He used Transsinuosa instead. From ‚ÄúEarliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics at
http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html.

1.6. Other Trigonometric Functions

67

The domain of the secant function is the set of all real numbers t for

which t ¬§ C k for every integer k.
2
Next up is the cosecant function. 5
Definition. The cosecant function is the reciprocal of the secant function. So
1
the cosecant of a real number t is defined to be
for those values t where
sin.t /
sin.t / ¬§ 0. The common abbreviation for the cotangent of t is
csc.t / D

1
:
sin.t /

Since sin.t / D 0 whenever t D k for some integer k, we see that
The domain of the cosecant function is the set of all real numbers t for
which t ¬§ k for every integer k.
Finally, we have the cotangent function. 6
Definition. The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function.
1
So the cotangent of a real number t is defined to be
for those values t
tan.t /
where tan.t / ¬§ 0. The common abbreviation for the cotangent of t is
cot.t / D

1
:
tan.t /

Since tan.t / D 0 whenever t D k for some integer k, we see that
The domain of the cotangent function is the set of all real numbers t for
which t ¬§ k for every integer k.
5 Georg Joachim von Lauchen Rheticus appears to be the first to use the term cosecant (as cosecans

in Latin) in his Opus Palatinum de triangulis. From Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of
Mathematics at http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html.
6 The word cotangent was introduced by Edmund Gunter in Canon Triangulorum (Table of Artificial Sines and Tangents) where he used the term cotangens in Latin. From Earliest Known Uses of
Some of the Words of Mathematics at http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html.

When it is not possible to determine exact values of a trigonometric function, we
use a calculator to determine approximate values. However, please keep in mind
that many calculators only have keys for the sine, cosine, and tangent functions.
With these calculators, we must use the definitions of cosecant, secant, and cotangent to determine approximate values for these functions.

Wherever we live, we have experienced the fact that the amount of daylight where
we live varies over the year but that the amount of daylight we be the about the same

repeating) phenomena. Another example of something that is periodic is a sound
wave. In fact, waves are usually represented by a picture such as the following:

As we will see in this Chapter, the sine and cosine functions provide an excellent
way to study these waves mathematically.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this

these questions.
 What are the graphs and important properties of the graphs of y D

 What are the domains of the sine and cosine functions? What are the

 What are the periods of the sine and cosine functions? What does period
mean?
 What is amplitude? How does the amplitude affect the graph of the sine
or cosine?

Beginning Activity

and then draw the graph of y D sin.t / for 0  t  2. Note: On the t -axis,

2. We can also use a graphing calculator or other graphing device to draw the
graph of the sine function. Make sure the device is set to radian mode and use
it to draw the graph of y D sin.t / using 2  t  4 and 1:2  y  1:2.
Note: Many graphing utilities require the use of x as the independent variable. For such devices, we need to use y D sin.x/. This will make no
difference in the graph of the function.
(a) Compare this to the graph from part (1). What are the similarities?
What are the differences?

74

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions
(b) Find four separate values of t where the graph of the sine function
crosses the t -axis. Such values are called t -intercepts of the sine function (or roots or zeros).
(c) Based on the graphs, what appears to be the maximum value of sin.t /.
Determine two different values of t that give this maximum value of
sin.t /.
(d) Based on the graphs, what appears to be the minimum value of sin.t /.
Determine two different values of t that give this minimum value of
sin.t /.

The Periods of the Sine and Cosine Functions
One thing we can observe from the graphs of the sine function in the beginning
activity is that the graph seems to have a ‚Äúwave‚Äù form and that this ‚Äúwave‚Äù repeats
as we move along the horizontal axis. We see that the portion of the graph between
0 and 2 seems identical to the portion of the graph between 2 and 4 and to
the portion of the graph between 2 and 0. The graph of the sine function is
exhibiting what is known as a periodic property. Figure 2.1 shows the graph of
y D sin.t / for three cycles.

We say that the sine function is a periodic function. Such functions are often
used to model repititious phenomena such as a pendulm swinging back and forth,
a weight attached to a spring, and a vibrating guitar string.

2.1. Graphs of the Cosine and Sine Functions

75

The reason that the graph of y D sin.t / repeats is that the value of sin.t / is the
y-coordinate of a point as it moves around the unit circle. Since the circumference
of the unit circle is 2 units, an arc of length .t C 2/ will have the same terminal
point as an arc of length t . Since sin.t / is the y-coordinate of this point, we see
that sin.t C 2/ D sin.t /. This means that the period of the sine function is 2.
Following is a more formal definition of a periodic function.
Definition. A function f is periodic with period p if f .t C p/ D f .t / for
all t in the domain of f and p is the smallest positive number that has this
property.
Notice that if f is a periodic function with period p, then if we add 2p to t , we
get
f .t C 2p/ D f ..t C p/ C p/ D f .t C p/ D f .t /:
We can continue to repeat this process and see that for any integer k,
f .t C kp/ D f .t /:
So far, we have been discussing only the sine function, but we get similar behavior
with the cosine function. Recall that the wrapping function wraps the number
line around the unit circle in a way that repeats in segments of length 2. This
is periodic behavior and it leads to periodic behavior of both the sine and cosine
functions since the value of the sine function is the y-coordinate of a point on the
unit circle and the value of the cosine function is the x-coordinate of the same
point on the unit circle, the sine and cosine functions repeat every time we make
one wrap around the unit circle. That is,
cos.t C 2/ D cos.t / and

It is important to recognize that 2 is the smallest number that makes this happen.
Therefore, the cosine and sine functions are periodic with period 2.
Progress Check 2.1 (The Graph of the Cosine Function).
We can, of course, use a graphing utility to draw the graph of the cosine function.
However, it does help to understand the graph if we actually draw the graph by
hand as we did for the sine function in the beginning activity. Use the values in the
given table to plot the points on the graph of y D cos.t / and then draw the graph
of y D cos.t / for 0  t  2.

Figure 2.2: Graph of y D cos.t / with 2  t  4
Progress Check 2.2 (The Cosine Function).
1. Compare the graph in Figure 2.2 to the graph from Progress Check 2.1. What
are the similarities? What are the differences?
2. Find four separate values of t where the graph of the cosine function crosses
the t -axis. Such values are called t -intercepts of the cosine function (or
roots or zeros).
3. Based on the graphs, what appears to be the maximum value of cos.t /. Determine two different values of t that give this maximum value of cos.t /.
4. Based on the graphs, what appears to be the minimum value of cos.t /. Determine two different values of t that give this minimum value of cos.t /.
Activity 2.3 (The Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions).
We have now constructed the graph of the sine and cosine functions by plotting
points and by using a graphing utility. We can have a better understanding of these
graphs if we can see how these graphs are related to the unit circle definitions of
sin.t / and cos.t /. We will use two Geogebra applets to help us do this.
The first applet is called Sine Graph Generator. The web address is
http://gvsu.edu/s/Ly
To begin, just move the slider for t until you get t D 1 and observe the resulting
image. On the left, there will be a copy of the unit circle with an arc drawn that has

78

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

length 1. The y-coordinate of the terminal point of this arc (0.84 rounded to the
nearest hundredth) will also be displayed. The horizontal line will be connected to
the point .1; 0:84/ on the graph of y D sin.t /. As the values of t are changed with
the slider, more points will be drawn in this manner on the graph of y D sin.t /.
The other applet is called Cosine Graph Generator and it works in a manner
similar to Sine Graph Generator. The web address for this applet is
http://gvsu.edu/s/Lz

Properties of the Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions
The graphs of y D sin.t / and y D cos.t / are called sinusoidal waves and the
sine and cosine functions are called sinusoidal functions. Both of these particular
sinusoidal waves have a period of 2. The graph over one period is called a cycle
of the graph. As with other functions in our previous study of algebra, another
important property of graphs is their intercepts, in particular, the horizontal intercepts or the points where the graph crosses the horizontal axis. One big difference
from algebra is that the sine and cosine functions have infinitely many horizontal
intercepts.
In Progress Check 2.2, we used Figure 2.2 and determined that
  3 5 7
; ;
;
;
2 2 2 2 2
are t -intercepts on the graph of y D cos.t /. In particular,

In the interval ≈í0; 2¬ç, the only t -intercepts of y D cos.t / are t D and
2
3
tD
.
2

There are, of course, other t -intercepts, and this is where the period of 2 is helpful.
We can generate any other t -intercept of y D cos.t / by adding integer multiples of
the period 2 to these two values. For example, if we add 6 to each of them, we
see that
13
15
tD
and t D
are t intercepts of y D cos.t /:

Progress Check 2.4 (The t -intercepts of the Sine Function)
Use a graph to determine the t -intercepts of y D sin.t / in the interval ≈í0; 2¬ç.
Then use the period property of the sine function to determine the t -intercepts
of y D sin.t / in the interval ≈í 2; 4¬ç. Compare this result to the graph in
Figure 2.1. Finally, determine two t -intercepts of y D sin.t / that are not in the
interval ≈í 2; 4¬ç.
Activity 2.5 (Exploring Graphs of Sine Functions)
Do one of the following:
1
sin.x/ and y D 2 sin.x/, y D
2
sin.x/, and y D 2 sin.x/ on the same axes. Make sure your graphing
utility is in radian mode and use 2  x  2 and 2:5  y  2:5.

1. Draw the graphs of y D sin.x/, y D

2. Use the Geogebra applet Amplitude of a Sinusoid at the following web address:
http://gvsu.edu/s/LM
The expression for g.t / can be changed but leave it set to g.t / D sin.t /. The
slider can be moved to change the value of A and the graph of y D A sin.t /
will be drawn. Explore these graphs by changing the values of A making sure
to use negative values of A as well as positive values of A. (It is possible to
change this to g.t / D cos.t / and explore the graphs of y D A cos.t /.

The Amplitude of Sine and Cosine Functions
The graphs of the functions from Activity 2.5 should have looked like one of the
graphs in Figure 2.3. Both graphs are graphs of y D A sin.t /, but the one on the
left is for A > 0 and the one on the right is for A < 0. Note that when A < 0,
A > 0. Another important characteristic of a sinusoidal wave is the amplitude.
The amplitude of each of the graphs in Figure 2.3 is represented by the length of
the dashed lines, and we see that this length is equal to jAj.
Definition. The amplitude of a sinusoidal wave is one-half the distance between the maximum and minimum functional values.

Using a Graphing Utility
We often will use a graphing utility to draw the graph of a sinusoidal function.
When doing so, it is a good idea to use the amplitude to help set an appropriate
viewing window. The basic idea is to have the screen on the graphing utility show
slightly more than one period of the sinusoid. For example, if we are trying to draw
a graph of y D 3:6 cos.x/, we could use the following viewing window.
0:5  x  6:5 and
If it is possible, set the x-tickmarks to be every

2:75 sin.x/.

Symmetry and the Negative Identities
Examine the graph of y D cos.t / shown in Figure 2.2. If we focus on that portion
of the graph between 2 and 2, we can notice that the left side of the graph

2.1. Graphs of the Cosine and Sine Functions

is the ‚Äúmirror image‚Äù of the right side of the graph. To see this better, use the
Geogebra applet Symmetry of the Graph of y D cos.t / at the following link:

(-t, b)

(t, b)

Figure 2.4: Graph Showing Symmetry of y D cos.t /
Figure 2.4 shows a typical image from this applet. Since the second coordinate of a
point on the graph is the value of the function at the first coordinate, this figure (and
applet) are indicating that b D cos.t / and b D cos. t /. That is, this is illustrating
the fact that cos. t / D cos.t /. The next activity provides an explanation as to why
this is true.
Activity 2.8 (Positive and Negative Arcs)
For this activity, we will use the Geogebra applet called Drawing a Positive Arc
and a Negative Arc on the Unit Circle. A link to this applet is
http://gvsu.edu/s/Ol
As the slider for t in the applet is used, an arc of length t will be drawn in blue
and an arc of length t will be drawn in red. In addition, the coordinates of the
terminal points of both the arcs t and t will be displayed. Study the coordinates
of these two points for various values of t . What do you observe? Keeping in mind
that the coordinates of these points can also be represented as
.cos.t /; sin.t // and .cos. t /; sin. t //;
what does these seem to indicate about the relationship between cos. t / and cos.t /?
What about the relationship between sin. t / and sin.t /?

Figure 2.5: An Arc and a Negative Arc on the Unit Circle
is that if the terminal point of the arc t is .a; b/, then by the symmetry of the circle,
we see that the terminal point of the arc t is .a; b/. So the diagram illustrates
the following results, which are sometimes called negative arc identities.

 Draw the graph of y D sin. x/ using 0  x  2. The graph should be
identical to the graph of y D sin.x/.
These so-called negative arc identities give us a way to look at the symmetry of the
graphs of the cosine and sine functions. We have already illustrated the symmetry
of the cosine function in Figure 2.4. Because of this, we say the graph of y D
cos.t / is symmetric about the y-axis.
What about symmetry in the graph of the sine function? Figure 2.6 illustrates
what the negative identity sin. t / D sin.t / implies about the symmetry of y D
sin.t /. In this case, we say the graph of y D sin.t / is symmetric about the origin.

Summary of Section 2.1
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:
 The important characteristics of sinusoidal functions of the form y D A sin.t /
or y D A cos.t / shown in Table 2.1.
 The information in Table 2.1 can seem like a lot to remember, and in fact,
in the next sections, we will get a lot more information about sinusoidal
waves. So instead of trying to remember everything in Table 2.1, it is better to remember the basic shapes of the graphs as shown in Figure 2.7 and
Figure 2.8.

Supplemental Material ‚Äì Even and Odd Functions
There is a more general mathematical context for these types of symmetry, and that
has to do with what are called even functions and odd functions.
Definition.
 A function f is an even function if f . x/ D f .x/ for all x in the
domain of f .
 A function f is an odd function if f . x/ D

f .x/ for all x in the

86

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

So with these definitions, we can say that the cosine function is an even function and the sine function is an odd function. Why do we use these terms? One
explanation is that the concepts of even functions and odd functions are used to
describe functions f of the form f .x/ D x n for some positive integer n, and the
graphs of these functions exhibit different types of symmetry when n is even versus
when n is odd.

y = f (x)

y = f (x)

(-x, f (-x))

(x, f (x))

(-x, f (-x))
Figure 2.9: f .x/ D x n , n even
and f . x/ D f .x/.

Figure 2.10: f .x/ D x n , n odd
and f . x/ D f .x/.

In Figure 2.9, we see that when n is even, f . x/ D f .x/ since . x/n D x n .
So the graph is symmetric about the y-axis. When n is odd as in Figure 2.10,
f . x/ D f .x/ since . x/n D x n . So the graph is symmetric about the
origin. This is why we use the term even functions for those functions f for which
f . x/ D f .x/, and we use the term odd functions for those functions for which
f . x/ D f .x/.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
Let A, B, C , and D be constants with B > 0 and consider the graph of
f .t / D A sin.B.t C // C D or f .t / D A cos.B.t C // C D.
 How does the value of A affect the graph of f ? How is A related to the
amplitude of f ?
 How does the value of B affect the graph of f ? How is B related to the
period of f ?
 How does the value of C affect the graph of f ?
 How does the value of D affect the graph of f ?
 What does a phase shift do to a sine or cosine graph? How do we recognize a phase shift from the equation of the sinusoid?
 How do we accurately draw the graph of y D A sin.B.t C // C D or
y D A cos.B.t C //CD without a calculator and how do we correctly
describe the effects of the constants A, B, C , and D on the graph?

Beginning Activity
In this section, we will study the graphs of functions whose equations are y D
A sin.B.t C // C D and y D A cos.B.t C // C D where A, B, C , and D
are real numbers. These functions are called sinusoidal functions and their graphs
are called sinusoidal waves. We will first focus on functions whose equations are
y D sin.Bt / and y D cos.Bt /. Now complete Part 1 or Part 2 of this beginning
activity.
Part 1 ‚Äì Using a Geogebra Applet
To begin our exploration, we will use a Geogebra applet called Period of a Sinusoid.
The web address for this applet is

2.2. Graphs of Sinusoidal Functions

91

http://gvsu.edu/s/LY
After you open the applet, notice that there is an input box at the top of the screen
where you can input a function. For now, leave this set at g.t / D sin.t /. The graph
of the sine function should be displayed. The slider at the top can be used to change
the value of B. When this is done, the graph of y D A sin.Bt / will be displayed
for the current value of B along with the graph of y D sin.t /.
1. Use the slider to change the value of B. Explain in detail the difference
between the graph of y D g.t / D sin.t / and y D f .t / D sin.Bt / for a
constant B > 0. Pay close attention to the graphs and determine the period
when
(a) B D 2.

(b) B D 3.

(c) B D 4.

(d) B D 0:5.

In particular, how does the period of y D sin.Bt / appear to depend on B?
Note: Consider doing two separate cases: one when B > 1 and the other
when 0 < B < 1.
2. Now click on the reset button in the upper right corner of the screen. This
will reset the value of the B to its initial setting of B D 1.
3. Change the function to g.t / D cos.t / and repeat part (1) for the cosine
function. Does changing the value of B affect the graph of y D cos.Bt /
in the same way that changing the value for B affects the graph of y D
sin.Bt /?
Part 2 ‚Äì Using a Graphing Utility
Make sure your graphing utility is set to radian mode. Note: Most graphing utilities
require the use of x (or X ) as the independent variable (input) for a function. We
will use x for the independent variable when we discuss the use of a graphing
utility.
1. We will first examine the graph of y D sin.Bx/ for three different values of
B. Graph the three functions:
y D sin.x/

y D sin.2x/

y D sin.4x/

using the following settings for the viewing window: 0  x  4 and
1:5  y  1:5. If possible on your graphing utility, set it so that the

92


tickmarks on the x-axis are space at units. Examine these graphs closely
2
and determine period for each sinusoidal wave. In particular, how does the
period of y D sin.Bx/ appear to depend on B?
2. Clear the graphics screen. We will now examine the graph of y D sin.Bx/
for three different values of B. Graph the following three functions:

and determine period for each sinusoidal wave. In particular, how does the
period of y D sin.Bx/ appear to depend on B?
3. How does the graph of y D sin.Bx/ appear to be related to the graph of
y D sin.x/. Note: Consider doing two separate cases: one when B > 1 and
the other when 0 < B < 1.

The Period of a Sinusoid
When we discuss an expression such as sin.t / or cos.t /, we often refer to the
expression inside the parentheses as the argument of the function. In the beginning
activity, we examined situations in which the argument was Bt for some number
B. We also saw that this number affects the period of the sinusoid. If we examined
graphs close enough, we saw that the period of y D sin.Bt / and y D cos.Bt / is
2
equal to
. The graphs in Figure 2.11 illustrate this.
B
Notice that the graph of y D sin.2t / has one complete cycle over the interval
2
≈í0; ¬ç and so its period is  D
. The graph of y D sin.4t / has one complete
h i 2

cycle over the interval 0;
and so its period is

. In these two cases,

we had B > 1 in y D sin.Bt /. Do 

94

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

constant B, it can change the input we need to get a specific output. For example,
the input of t D 0 in y D sin.t / and y D sin.Bt / yield the same output. To
complete one period in y D sin.t / we need to go through interval of length 2 so
that our input is 2. However, in order for the argument (Bt ) in y D sin.Bt / to be
2
2, we need Bt D 2 and if we solve this for t , we get t D
. So the function
B
given by y D sin.Bt / (or y D cos.Bt /) will complete one complete cycle when t

varies from t D 0 to t D

Part 1 ‚Äì Using a Geogebra Applet
We will use a Geogebra applet called Sinusoid ‚Äì Phase Shift. The web address for
this applet is
http://gvsu.edu/s/Mu
After you open the applet, notice that there is an input box at the top of the screen
where you can input a function. For now, leave this set at g.t / D sin.t /. The
graph of the sine function should be displayed. The slider at the top can be used to
change the value of C . When this is done, the graph of y D A sin.t C / will be
displayed for the current value of C along with the graph of y D sin.t /.
1. Use the slider to change the value of C . Explain in detail the difference

In particular, describe the difference between the graph of y D sin.t C /

2. Now click on the reset button in the upper right corner of the screen. This
will reset the value of the C to its initial setting of C D 0.
3. Change the function to g.t / D cos.t / and repeat part (1) for the cosine
function. Does changing the value of C affect the graph of y D cos.t C /
affect the sinusoidal wave in the same way that changing the value for C

values of C .
2. Clear the graphics screen. We will now examine the graph of y D sin.x C /

the graph of y D sin.t C / and the graph of y D sin.t / for these values of
C.
3. Describe the difference between the graph of y D sin.x C / and the graph
of y D sin.x/? Note: Consider doing two separate cases: one when C > 0
and the other when C < 0.
By exploring the graphs in Activity 2.10, we should notice that when C > 0,
the graph of y D sin.t C / is the graph of y D sin.t / horizontally translated
to the right by C units. In a similar manner, the graph of y D cos.t C / is
the graph of y D cos.t / horizontally translated to the right by C units. When
working with a sinusoidal graph, such a horizontal translation is called a phase
shift. This isillustrated
in Figure 2.13 , which shows the graphs of y D sin.t 1/

and y D sin t
. For reference, the graph of y D sin.t / is also shown.

So, why are we seeing this phase shift? The reason is that the graph of y D
sin.t / will go through one complete cycle over the interval defined by 0  t  2.
Similarly, the graph of y D sin.t C / will go through one complete cycle over the
interval defined by 0  t C  2. Solving for t , we see that C  t  2 C C .
So we see that this cylcle for y D sin.t / has been shifted by C units.
This argument also works when C < 0 and when we use the cosine function
instead of the sine

Vertical Shift
We have one more transformation of a sinusoid to explore, the so-called vertical
shift. This is one by adding a constant to the equation for a sinusoid and is explored
in the following activity.
Activity 2.12 (The Vertical Shift of a Sinuosid)
Complete Part 1 or Part 2 of this activity.

Part 1 ‚Äì Using a Geogebra Applet
We will now investigate the effect of adding a constant to a sinusoidal function.
That is, we will investigate what effect the value of a real number D has the graph
of y D A sin.B.t C // C D and y D A cos.B.t C // C D. Complete Part 1 or
Part 2 of this activity. We will use a Geogebra applet called Exploring a Sinusoid.
The web address for this applet is
http://gvsu.edu/s/LX
After you open the applet, notice that there is an input box at the top of the screen
where you can input a function. For now, leave this set at g.t / D sin.t /. The graph
of the sine function should be displayed. There are four sliders at the top that can
be used to change the values of A, B, C , and D.

2.2. Graphs of Sinusoidal Functions

1. Leave the values A D 1, B D 1, and C D 0 set. Use the slider for D to
change the value of C . When this is done, the graph of y D sin.t / C D will
be displayed for the current value of D along with the graph of y D sin.t /.
(a) Use the slider to change the value of D. Explain in detail the difference
between the graph of y D g.t / D sin.t / and y D f .t / D sin.t / C D

In particular, describe the difference between the graph of y D sin.t /C
D and the graph of y D sin.t /? Note: Consider doing two separate
cases: one when D > 0 and the other when D < 0.
(b) Now click on the reset button in the upper right corner of the screen.
This will reset the value of the C to its initial setting of C D 0.
(c) Change the function to g.t / D cos.t / and repeat part (1) for the cosine function. Does changing the value of D affect the graph of y D
cos.t / C D affect the sinusoidal wave in the same way that changing
the value for D affects the graph of y D sin.t / C D?
2. Now change the value of A to 0:5, the value of B to 2, and the value of C to
0.5. The graph of g.t / D cos.t / will still be displayed but we will now have
f .t / D 0:5 cos.2.t 0:5// C D. Does changing the value of D affect the
graph of y D 0:5 cos.2.t 0:5// C D affect the sinusoidal wave in the same
way that changing the value for D affects the graph of y D cos.t /?
Part 2 ‚Äì Using a Graphing Utility
Make sure your graphing utility is set to radian mode.
1. We will first examine the graph of y D cos.x/ C D for four different values
of D. Graph the five functions:
y D cos.x/

y D cos.x/ C 1

between the graph of y D cos.x/ C D and the graph of y D cos.x/ for
these values of D.

100

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

2. Clear the graphics screen. We will now examine the graph of y D 0:5 cos.2.x
0:5//CD for two different values of D. Graph the following three functions:
y D 0:5 cos.2.x

y D 0:5 cos.2.x

using the following settings for the viewing window: 0  x  2 and

between the graph of y D 0:5 cos.2.x 0:5// C D and the graph of y D
0:5 cos.2.x 0:5// for these values of D.

By exploring the graphs in Activity 2.12, we should notice that the graph of
something like y D A sin.B.t C // C D is the graph of y D A sin.B.t C //
shifted up D units when D > 0 and shifted down jDj units when D < 0. When
working with a sinusoidal graph, such a vertical translation is called a vertical
shift. This is illustrated in Figure 2.15 for a situation in which D > 0.

The y-axis is not shown in Figure 2.15 because this shows a general graph with
a phase shift.
What we have done in Activity 2.12 is to start with a graph such as y D
A sin.B.t C // and added a constant to the dependent variable to get y D A sin.B.t
C //CD. So when t stays the same, we are adding D to the the dependent variable.
The effect is to translate the entire graph up by D units if D > 0 and down by jDj
units if D < 0.

4. The vertical shift of the sinusoidal graph is jDj.

is especially true when the period is small or large. For example, consider the

For this sinusoid:
1. What is the amplitude?

1. Determine the coordinates of the points Q and R. The vertical distance
between these two points is equal to two times the amplitude. Use the ycoordinates of these points to determine two times the amplitude and then
the amplitude.
2. The center line for the sinusoid is half-way between the high point Q and
the low point R. Use the y-coordinates of Q and R to determine the center

4. We will now find an equation of the form y D A cos.B.t C // C D. We
still need the phase shift C . Use the point Q to determine the phase shift
and hence, the value of C . We now have values for A, B, C , and D for the
equation y D A cos.B.t C // C D.
5. To determine an equation of the form y D A sin.B.t C 0// C D, we will
use the point P to determine the phase shift C 0 . (A different symbol was
used because C 0 will be different than C in part (4).) Notice that the ycoordinate of P is 4 and so P lies on the center line. We can use the fact that
the horizontal distance between P and Q is equal to one-quarter of a period.
Determine the t coordinate of P , which will be equal to C 0. Now write the
equation y D A sin.B.t C 0// C D using the values of A, B, C 0, and D
that we have determined.
We can check the equations we found in parts (4) and (5) by graphing these equations using a graphing utility.

 The center line y D D for the sinusoid is half-way between the maximum

found by calculating the average of the y-coordinates of these two points.
 The horizontal distance between any two successive points on the line y D
D in Figure 2.19 is one-quarter of a period.
In Progress Check 2.16, we will use some of these facts to help determine an equation that will model the volume of blood in a person‚Äôs heart as a function of time. A
mathematical model is a function that describes some phenomenon. For objects
that exhibit periodic behavior, a sinusoidal function can be used as a model since
these functions are periodic. However, the concept of frequency is used in some
applications of periodic phenomena instead of the period.
Definition. The frequency of a sinusoidal function is the number of periods
(or cycles) per unit time.
A typical unit for freqency is the hertz. One hertz (Hz) is one cycle per second.
This unit is named after Heinrich Hertz (1857 ‚Äì 1894).
Since frequency is the number of cyles per unit time, and the period is the
amount of time to complete one cycle, we see that frequency and period are related
as follows:
1
frequency D
:
period
Progress Check 2.16 (Volume of Blood in a Person‚Äôs Heart)
The volume of the average heart is 140 milliliters (ml), and it pushes out about
one-half its volume (70 ml) with each beat. In addition, the frequency of the for
a well-trained athlete heartbeat for a well-trained athlete is 50 beats (cycles) per
minute. We will model the volume, V .t / (in milliliters) of blood in the heart as a
function of time t measured in seconds. We will use a sinusoidal function of the
form
V .t / D A cos.B.t C // C D:

112

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

If we choose time 0 minutes to be a time when the volume of blood in the heart is
the maximum (the heart is full of blood), then it reasonable to use a cosine function
for our model since the cosine function reaches a maximum value when its input
is 0 and so we can use C D 0, which corresponds to a phase shift of 0. So our
function can be written as V .t / D A cos.Bt / C D.
1. What is the maximum value of V .t /? What is the minimum value of V .t /?
Use these values to determine the values of A and D for our model? Explain.
2. Since the frequency of heart beats is 50 beats per minute, we know that
1
the time for one heartbeat will be
of a minute. Determine the time (in
50
seconds) it takes to complete one heartbeat (cycle). This is the period for
this sinusoidal function. Use this period to determine the value of B. Write
the formula for V .t / using the values of A, B, C , and D that have been
determined.

Now that we have determined that

V .t / D 35 cos

(where t is measured in seconds since the heart was full and V .t / is measured in

to determine other values associated with the amount of blood in the heart. For
example:
 We can determine the amount of blood in the heart 1 second after the heart
was full by using t D 1.

 Suppose that we want to know at what times after the heart is full that there
will be 100 milliliters of blood in the heart. We can determine this if we can
solve the equation V .t / D 100 for t . That is, we need to solve the equation

Although we will learn other methods for solving this type of equation later
in the book, we can use a graphing utility to determine approximate solutions
for this equation. Figure 2.20 shows the graphs of y D V .t / and y D 100.
To solve the equation, we need to use a graphing utility that allows us to
determine or approximate the points of intersection of two graphs. (This can
be done using most Texas Instruments calculators and Geogebra.) The idea
is to find the coordinates of the points P , Q, and R in Figure 2.20.

We really only need to find the coordinates of one of those points since we
can use properties of sinusoids to find the others. For example, we can determine that the coordinates of P are . 0:3274; 100/. Then using the fact
that the graph of y D V .t / is symmetric about the y-axis, we know the coordinates of Q are .0:3274; 100/. We can then use the periodic property of
the function, to determine the t -coordinate of R by adding one period to the
6
t -coordinate of P . This gives 0:3274 C D 0:8726, and the coordinates
5
of R are .0:8726; 100/. We can also use the periodic property to determine
as many solutions of the equation V .t / D 100 as we like.

Progress Check 2.18 (Hours of Daylight)
The summer solstice in 2014 was on June 21 and the winter solstice was on December 21. The maximum hours of daylight occurs on the summer solstice and the
minimum hours of daylight occurs on the winter solstice. According to the U.S.
Naval Observatory website,
http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Dur_OneYear.php,
the number of hours of daylight in Grand Rapids, Michigan on June 21, 2014 was
15.35 hours, and the number of hours of daylight on December 21, 2014 was 9.02
hours. This means that in Grand Rapids,
 The maximum number of hours of daylight was 15.35 hours and occured on
day 172 of the year.
 The minimum number of hours of daylight was 9.02 hours and occured on
day 355 of the year.
1. Let y be the number of hours of daylight in 2014 in Grand Rapids and let
t be the day of the year. Determine a sinusoidal model for the number of
hours of daylight y in 2014 in Grand Rapids as a function of t .
2. According to this model,
(a) How many hours of daylight were there on March 10, 2014?
(b) On what days of the year were there 13 hours of daylight?

Determining a Sinusoid from Data
In Progress Check 2.18 the values and times for the maximum and minimum hours
of daylight. Even if we know some phenomenon is periodic, we may not know the
values of the maximum and minimum. For example, the following table shows the
number of daylight hours (rounded to the nearest hundredth of an hour) on the first
of the month for Edinburgh, Scotland (55ƒ± 570 N, 3ƒ± 120 W).
We will use a sinusoidal function of the form y D A sin.B.t C // C D, where
y is the number of hours of daylight and t is the time measured in months to model
this data. We will use 1 for Jan., 2 for Feb., etc. As a first attempt, we will use 17.48
for the maximum hours of daylight and 7.08 for the minimum hours of daylight.

So we will use the function y D 5:2 sin

of hours of daylight. Figure 2.21 shows a scatterplot for the data and a graph of
this function. Although the graph fits the data reasonably well, it seems we should
be able to find a better model. One of the problems is that the maximum number
of hours of daylight does not occur on July 1. It probably occurs about 10 days
earlier. The minimum also does not occur on January 1 and is probably somewhat
less that 7.08 hours. So we will try a maximum of 17.50 hours and a minimun of
7.06 hours. Also, instead of having the maximum occur at t D 7, we will say it

occurs at t D 6:7. Using these values, we have A D 5:22, B D , C D 3:7, and

This appears to model the data very well. One important thing to note is that
when trying to determine a sinusoid that ‚Äúfits‚Äù or models actual data, there is no
single correct answer. We often have to find one model and then use our judgement
in order to determine a better model. There is a mathematical ‚Äúbest fit‚Äù equation
for a sinusoid that is called the sine regression equation. Please note that we
need to use some graphing utility or software in order to obtain a sine regression
equation. Many Texas Instruments calculators have such a feature as does the

A scatterplot with a graph of this function is shown in Figure 2.23.
Note: See the supplements at the end of this section for instructions on how to use
Geogebra and a Texas Instruments TI-84 to determine a sine regression equation
for a given set of data.
It is interesting to compare equation (1) and equation (2), both of which are
models for the data in Table 2.2. We can see that both equations have a similar
amplitude and similar vertical shift, but notice that equation (2) is not in our standard form for the equation of a sinusoid. So we cannot immediately tell what that
equation is saying about the period and the phase shift. In this next activity, we will
learn how to determine the period and phase shift for sinusoids whose equations
are of the form y D a sin.bt C c/ C d or y D a cos.bt C c/ C d .
Activity 2.19 (Working with Sinusoids that Are Not In Standard Form)
So far, we have been working with sinusoids whose equations are of the form
y D A sin.B.t C // C D or y D A cos.B.t C // C D. When written in
this form, we can use the values of A, B, C , and D to determine the amplitude,

however, that to to this, the equation must be written in exactly this form. If we
have an equation in a slightly different form, we have to determine if there is a way
to use algebra to rewrite the equation in the form y D A sin.B.t C // C D or
y D A cos.B.t C // C D. Consider the equation

Supplement ‚Äì Sine Regression Using Geogebra
Before giving written instructions for creating a sine regression equation in Geogebra, it should be noted that there is a Geogebra Playlist on the Grand Valley State
University Math Channel on YouTube. The web address is
http://gvsu.edu/s/QA
The video screencasts that are of most interest for now are:
 Geogebra ‚Äì Basic Graphing

 Geogebra ‚Äì Copying the Graphics
View

 Geogebra ‚Äì Plotting Points

 Geogebra ‚Äì Sine Regression

To illustrate the procedure for a sine regression equation using Geogebra, we
will use the data in Table 2.2 on page 115.
Step 1. Set a viewing window that is appropriate for the data that will be used.
Step 2. Enter the data points. There are three ways to do this.
 Perhaps the most efficient way to enter points is to use the spreadsheet
view. To do this, click on the View Menu and select Spreadsheet. A
small spreadsheet will open on the right. Although you can use any
sets of rows and columns, an easy way is to use cells A1 and B1 for the
first data point, cells A2 and B2 for the second data point, and so on.
So the first few rows in the spreadsheet would be:
1
2
3

A
1
2
3

B
7.08
8.6
10.73

Once all the data is entered, to plot the points, select the rows and
columns in the spreadsheet that contain the data, then click on the small
downward arrow on the bottom right of the button with the label f1; 2g
and select ‚ÄúCreate List of Points.‚Äù A small pop-up screen will appear in
which the list of points can be given a name. The default name is ‚Äúlist‚Äò‚Äù
but that can be changed if desired. Now click on the Create button in
the lower right side of the pop-up screen. If a proper viewing window
has been set, the points should appear in the graphics view. Finally,
close the spreadsheet view.

2.3. Applications and Modeling with Sinusoidal Functions

121

 Enter each point separately as an order pair. For example, for the first
point in Table 2.2, we would enter .1; 7:08/. In this case, each point
will be given a name such as A, B, C , etc.
 Enter all the points in a list. For example (for a smaller set of points),
we could enter something like
pt s D f. 3; 3/; . 2; 1/; .0; 1/; .1; 3/; .3; 0/g
Notice that the list of ordered pairs must be enclosed in braces.
Step 3. Use the FitSin command. How this is used depends on which option was
used to enter and plot the data points.
 If a list of points has been created (such as one named list1), simply
enter
f .x/ D FitSin[list1]
All that is needed is the name of the list inside the brackets.
 If separate data points have been enter, include the names of all the
points inside the brackets and separate them with commas. An abbreviated version of this is
f .x/ D FitSin[A, B, C]
The sine regression equation will now be shown in the Algebra view
and will be graphed in the graphics view.
Step 4. Select the rounding option to be used. (This step could be performed at
any time.) To do this, click on the Options menu and select Rounding.

 To determine a sinusoidal function that models a periodic phenomena, we
need to determine the amplitude, the period, and the vertical shift for the
periodic phenomena. In addition, we need to determine whether to use a
cosine function or a sine function and the resulting phase shift.
 A sine regression equation can be determined that is a mathematical ‚Äúbest

it pushes out about 54% its volume with each beat. We will model the volume, V .t / of blood (in milliliters) in the heart at any time t , as a sinusoidal
function of the form

where V0 is a positive constant and f is the frequency. The frequency is the
number of complete oscillations (cycles) per second. In the United States, f

phase shifts. (Note: A frequency of 60 cycles per second corresponds to a

Let C be the current (in amperes), let V be the voltage (in volts), and let t be
time (in seconds). The following list gives information that is known about
C and V .
 The current C is a sinusoidal function of time with a frequency of 60
cycles per second, and it reaches its maximum of 5 amperes when t D
0 seconds.
 The voltage V is a sinusoidal function of time with a frequency of
60 cycles per second. As shown in the graphs on the next page, V
‚Äúleads‚Äù the current in the sense that it reaches its maximum before the
current reaches its maximum. (‚ÄúLeading‚Äù corresponds to a negative
phase shift, and ‚Äúlagging‚Äù corresponds to a positive phase shift.) In
this case, the voltage V leads the current by 0.003 seconds, meaning
that it reaches its maximum 0.003 seconds before the current reaches
its maximum.
 The peak voltage is 180 volts.
 There is no vertical shift on either the current or the voltage graph.

This model will be in the form y D a sin.bt C c/ C d , where a, b, c,
and d are real numbers.
(d) Determine the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift for the

6. Modeling the Distance from the Earth to the Sun. The Earth‚Äôs orbit
around the sun is not a perfect circle. In 1609 Johannes Kepler published
two of his famous laws of planetary motion, one of which states that planetary orbits are actually ellipses. So the distance from the Earth to the sun is
not a constant, but varies over the course of its orbit (we will assume a 365
day year). According to the 1996 US Ephemeris1 , the distances from the sun
to the Earth on the 21st of each month are given in Table 2.3. The distances
are measured in Astronomical Units (AU), where 1 AU is approximately
149,597,900 kilometers.

A plot of this data with the day of the year along the horizontal axis and the

f .t / D A sin.B.t

(a) What are the maximum and minimum distances from the Earth to the

data in Table 2.3. Then use the ‚ÄúFitSin‚Äù command in Geogebra to find a
sinusoidal model for this data of the form g.t / D a sin.bt C c/ C d .
What is the amplitude of this sinusoidal model? What is the period? What is

How do these values compare with the corresponding values for the sinusoid

8. As the moon orbits the earth, the appearance of the moon changes. We see
various lunar disks at different times of the month. These changes reappear
during each lunar month. However, a lunar month is not exactly the same
as the twelve months we use in our calendar today. A lunar month is the
number of days it takes the moon to go through one complete cycle from a
full moon (100% illumination) to the next full moon.
The following data were gathered from the web site for the U.S. Naval Observatory. The data are the percent of the moon that is illuminated is geocentric
value of the percent of the moon that is illuminated. That is, the percent of
illumination is computed for a fictitious observer located at the center of the
Earth.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What are the important properties of the graph of y D tan.t /. That is,
what is the domain and what is the range of the tangent function, and
what happens to the values of the tangent function at the points that are
near points not in the domain of the tangent function?
 What are the important properties of the graph of y D sec.t /. That is,
what is the domain and what is the range of the secant function, and
what happens to the values of the secant function at the points that are
near points not in the domain of the secant function?
 What are the important properties of the graph of y D cot.t /. That is,
what is the domain and what is the range of the cotangent function, and
what happens to the values of the cotangent function at the points that
are near points not in the domain of the cotangent function?
 What are the important properties of the graph of y D csc.t /. That is,
what is the domain and what is the range of the cosecant function, and
what happens to the values of the cosecant function at the points that are
near points not in the domain of the cosecant function?
We have seen how the graphs of the cosine and sine functions are determined by
the definition of these functions. We also investigated the effects of the constants
A, B, C , and D on the graph of y D A sin.B.x C // C D and the graph of
y D A cos.B.x C // C D.
In the following beginning activity, we will explore the graph of the tangent
function. Later in this section, we will discuss the graph of the secant function,
and the graphs of the cotangent and cosecant functions will be explored in the
exercises. One of the key features of these graphs is the fact that they all have
vertical asymptotes. Important information about all four functions is summarized
at the end of this section.

the graphs of the vertical lines x D 1 and x D 1.

1. Use a graphing utility to draw the graph of f .x/ D

The graph of the function f has vertical asymptotes x D 1 and x D 1.
The reason for this is that at these values of x, the numerator of the function
is not zero and the denominator is 0. So x D 1 and x D 1 are not in
the domain of this function. In general, if a function is a quotient of two
functions, then there will be a vertical asymptote for those values of x for
which the numerator is not zero and the denominator is zero. We will see
this for the the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions.

4. What are some of the vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function y D

The Graph of the Tangent Function
The graph of the tangent function is very different than the graphs of the sine and
sin.t /
, there are values of t
cosine functions. One reason is that because tan.t / D

In particular, the real numbers

function. So the graph of the tangent function will have vertical asymptotes at

t D
and t D
(as well as at othe values). We should have observed this in
2

the beginning activity.
So to draw an accurate graph of the tangent function, it will be necessary to
understand the behavior of the tangent near the points that are not in its domain.
We now investigate the behavior of the tangent for points whose values of t that

Effects of Constants on the Graphs of the Tangent Function
There are similarities and a some differences in the methods of drawing the graph
of a function of the form y D A tan.B.t C // C D and drawing the graph of a
function of the form y D A sin.B.t C // C D. See page 101 for a summary of
the effects of the parameters A, B, C , and D on the graph of a sinusoidal function.
One of the differences in dealing with a tangent (secant, cotangent, or cosecant) function is that we do not use the terminology that is specific to sinusoidal
waves. In particular, we will not use the terms amplitude and phase shift. Instead of
amplitude, we use the more general term vertical strech (or vertical compression),
and instead of phase shift, we use the more general term horizontal shift. We will
explore this is the following progress check.

Exercises for Section 2.4
1. In this exercise, we will explore the period of the tangent function.
?

(a) Use the definition of the tangent function and the fact that the period of
both the sine and cosine functions is equal to 2 to prove that for any
real number t in the domain of the tangent function,
tan.t C 2/ D tan.t /:

However, this does not prove that
the period of the tangent function
is equal to 2. We will now show
that the period is equal to . The
key to the proof is the diagram to
the right.

Suppose that P is the terminal point of the arc t . So cos.t / D a and sin.t / D
b. The diagram shows a point Q that is the terminal point of the arc t C .
By the symmetry of the circle, we know that the point Q has coordinates

a and sin.t C / D

b.

(c) Use the information in part (a) and the definition of the tangent function
to prove that tan.t C / D tan.t /.

The diagram also indicates that the smallest positive value of p for which
tan.t C p/ D tan.t / must be p D . Hence, the period the tangent function
is equal to .
2. We have seen that cos. t / D cos.t / and sin. t / D sin.t / for every real
number t . Now assume that t is a real number for which tan.t / is defined.
(a) Use the definition of the tangent function to write a formula for tan. t /
in terms of sin. t / and cos. t /.
(b) Now use the negative arc identities for the cosine and sine functions
to help prove that tan. t / D tan.t /. This is called the negative arc
identity for the tangent function.

each value of t , a vertical line is drawn from the point .t; sin.t // to the

The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 Why doesn‚Äôt the sine function really have an inverse? What do we mean,
then, by the inverse sine function? In other words, how is the inverse
sine function defined?

Introduction
The work in the beginning activity illustrates the general problem that if we are
given a function f and y D f .x/, can we find the values of x if we know the
value of y. In effect, this means that if we know the value of y, can we solve for
the value of x? For the first problem, we can substitute y D 4 into y D 5x C 7 and
solve for x. This gives

The work with the equation x 2 D 25 shows that we can have more than one solution for this type of problem. With trigonometric functions, we can even have
1
more solutions. For example, if y D sin.x/ and y D , we have
2
1
sin.x/ D :
2
If we restrict the values of x to 0  x  2, there will be two solutions as shown
in Figure 2.32
1

‚àí1

Figure 2.32: Graph Showing sin.x/ D

2

From our knowledge of the common arcs and reference arcs, these two solu
5
tions are x D and x D
. In addition, the periodic nature of the sine function
6
6
tells us that if there are no restrictions on x, there will be infinitely many solutions
1
of the equation sin.x/ D . What we want to develop is a method to indicate
2
exactly one of these solutions. But which one do we choose?
We have done something like this when we solve an equation such as x 2 D 25.
There are two solutions to this equation, but we have a function (the square root
function) that gives us exactly one of these two functions. So when we write x D
p
25 D 5, we are specifying only the positive
psolution of the equation. If we want
the other solution, we have to write x D
25 D 5. Notice that we used the

144

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

square root function to designate the ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù of the two functions, namely the
positive solution.
For the sine function, what we want is an inverse sine function that does just
what the name suggests ‚Äì uniquely reverses what the sine function does. That is,
the inverse sine function takes a value from the range of the sine function and gives
us exactly one arc whose sine has that value. We will try to do this in as simple of
a manner as possible. (It may sometimes be hard to believe, but mathematicians
generally do try to keep things simple.) To be more specific, if we have y D sin.x/,
we want to be able to specify any value for y with 1  y  1 and obtain one
value for x. We will choose the value for x that is as close to 0 as possible. (Keep
it simple.)
So ensure that there is only one solution, we will restrict the graph of y D


 x  . This also guarantees that 1  y  1 as
sin.x/ to the interval

Caution. Either notation may be used for the arcsine function. That is, arcsin.y/
and sin 1 .y/ mean the same thing. However, the notation sin 1 does not mean the
reciprocal of the sine but rather the inverse of the sine with a restricted domain. It
is very important to remember the facts that the domain of theh inverse isine is the
 
interval ≈í 1; 1¬ç and the range of the inverse sine is the interval

Note: Some people prefer using t D arcsin.y/ instead of t D sin 1 .y/ since it
can be a reminder of what the notation means. The equation t D arcsin.y/ is an
abbreviation for

The Inverse Cosine and Inverse Tangent Functions
In a manner similar to how we defined the inverse sine function, we can define the
inverse cosine and the inverse tangent functions. The key is to restrict the domain
of the corresponding circular function so that we obtain the graph of a one-to-one
function. So we will use y D cos.t / with 0  t   and y D tan.t / with

Solving Trigonmetric Equations

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
For these questions, we let q be a real number with 1  q  1 and let r be a
real number.
 How can an inverse trigonometric function be used to determine one
solution of an equation of the form sin.x/ D q, cos.x/ D q, or tan.x/ D
r?
 How can properties of the trigonometric functions be used to determine
all solutions of an equation of the form sin.x/ D q, cos.x/ D q, or
tan.x/ D r within one complete period of the trigonometric function?
 How can we use the period of a trigonometric function to determine
a formula for the solutions of an equation of the form sin.x/ D q,
cos.x/ D q, or tan.x/ D r?
Recall that a mathematical equation like x 2 D 1 is a relation between two
expressions that may be true for some values of the variable while an identity like
cos. x/ D cos.x/ is an equation that is true for all allowable values of the variable.
So an identity is a special type of equation. Equations that are not identities are also
called conditional equations because they are not valid for all allowable values of
the variable. To solve an equation means to find all of the values for the variables
that make the two expressions on either side of the equation equal to each other.
We solved algebraic equations in algebra and now we will solve trigonometric
equations.
A trigonometric equation is an equation that involves trigonometric functions. We have already used graphical methods to approximate solutions of trigonometric equations. In Example 2.17 on page 112, we used the function


5
V .t / D 35 cos

as a model for the amount of blood in the heart. For this function, t is measured in
seconds since the heart was full and V .t / is measured in milliliters. To determine

2.6. Solving Trigonmetric Equations

the times when there are 140 milliliters of blood in the heart, we needed to solve
the equation


5
t C 105 D 100:
35 cos
3
At that time, we used the ‚Äúintersect‚Äù capability of a graphing utility to determine
some solutions of this equation. In this section, we will learn how to use the inverse
cosine function and properties of the cosine function to determine the solutions of
this equation. We begin by first studying simpler equations.

Beginning Activity
Use a graphing utility to draw the graphs of y D cos.x/ and y D 0:7 on the same
axes using   x   and 1:2  y  1:2. Use the graphing utility to find
the points of intersection of these two graphs and to determine solutions of the
equation cos.x/ D 0:7.
In the beginning activity, we should have determined the following approximations for solutions of the equation cos.x/ D 0:7.
x1  0:79540; x2 

0:79540:

These approximations have been rounded to five decimal places.
The graph to the right shows the
two graphs using 3  x 
3. The solutions x1 and x2 are
shown on the graph. As can be
seen, the graph shows x1 and x2
and four other solutions to the
equation cos.x/ D 0:7. In fact,
if we imagine the graph extended
indefinitely to the left and to the
right, we can see that there are
infinitely many solutions for this
equation.
This is where we can use the fact that the period of the cosine function is 2.
The other solutions differ from x1 or x2 by an integer multiple of the period of 2.
We can represent an integer multiple of 2 by k.2/ for some integer k. So we
say that any solution of the equation cos.x/ D 0:7 can be approximated by
x  0:79540 C k.2/

or x 

0:79540 C k.2/:

158

Chapter 2. Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

For example, if we use k D 4, we see that
x  25:92814 or

x  24:33734:

We can use a calculator to check that for both values, cos.x/ D 0:7.

A Strategy for Solving a Trigonometric Equation
The example using the equation cos.x/ D 0:7 was designed to illustrate the fact
that if there are no restrictions placed on the unknown x, then there can be infinitely
many solutions for an equation of the form
‚Äúsome trigonometric function of x‚Äù = a number.
A general strategy to solve such equations is:
 Find all solutions of the equation within one period of the function. This is
often done by using properties of the trigonometric function. Quite often,
there will be two solutions within a single period.
 Use the period of the function to express formulas for all solutions by adding
integer multiples of the period to each solution found in the first step. For
example, if the function has a period of 2 and x1 and x2 are the only two
solutions in a complete period, then we would write the solutions for the
equation as
x D x1 C k.2/;

x D x2 C k.2/; where k is an integer:

Note: Instead of writing ‚Äúk is an integer,‚Äù we could write
k 2 f: : : ; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; : : :g.
Progress Check 2.34 (Solving a Trigonometric Equation)
Use a graph to approximate the solutions (rounded to four decimal places) of the
equation sin.x/ D 0:6 on the interval   x  . Then use the period of the
sine function to write formulas that can be used to approximate any solution of this
equation.

Using Inverse Functions to Solve Trigonometric Equations
Although we can use a graphing utility to determine approximations for solutions
to many equations, we often need to have some notation to indicate specific numbers (that are often solutions of equations). We have already seen this in previous

mathematics courses. For example, we use the notation 20 to represent the positive real number whose square is equal to 20. We can use this to say that the two
solutions of the equation x 2 D 20 are
p
p
20:
x D 20 and x D
p
Notice that there are two solutions of the equation but 20 represents only one of
those solutions. We will now learn how to use the inverse trigonometric functions
to do something similar for trigonometric equations. One big difference is that
most trigonometric equations will have infinitely many solutions instead of just
two. We will use the inverse trigonometric functions to represent one solution of
an equation and then learn how to represent all of the solutions in terms of this one
solution. We will first show how this is done with the equation cos.x/ D 0:7 from
the beginning activity for this section.
Example 2.35 (Solving an Equation Involving the Cosine Function)
For the equation cos.x/ D 0:7, we first use the result about the inverse cosine
function on page 150, which states that for t in the closed interval ≈í0; ¬ç,
cos

.cos.t // D t:

So we ‚Äúapply the inverse cosine function‚Äù to both sides of the equation cos.x/ D
0:7. This gives:

cos

1

cos.x/ D 0:7

.cos.x/ D cos

x D cos

.0:7/

.0:7/

Another thing we must remember is that this gives the one solution for the equation
that is in interval ≈í0; ¬ç. Before we use the periodic property, we need to determine
the other solutions for the equation in one complete period of the cosine function.
We can use the interval ≈í0; 2¬ç but it is easier to use the interval ≈í ; ¬ç. One
reason for this is the following so-called ‚Äúnegative arc identity‚Äù stated on page 82.
cos. x/ D cos.x/ for every real number x:
Hence, since one solution for the equation is x D cos 1 .0:7/, another solution is
x D cos 1 .0:7/. This means that the two solutions of the equation x D cos.x/
on the interval ≈í ; ¬ç are
x D cos

It can be verified that the equation cos.x/ D 0:7 has two solutions on the interval
≈í ; ¬ç by drawing the graphs of y D cos.x/ and y D 0:7 on the interval ≈í ; ¬ç.
So if we restrict ourselves to this interval, we have something very much like solving the equation x 2 D 20 in that there are two solutions that are negatives of each
other. The main difference now is that the trigonometric equation has infinitely
many solutions and as before, we now use the periodic property of the cosine function. Since the period is 2, just like with the numerical approximations from the
beginning activity, we can say that any solution of the equation cos.x/ D 0:7 will
be of the form
x D cos

Then use the periodic property of the cosine function to write formulas that can be

the equation in the form cos.x/ D ‚Äúsome number‚Äù.
The previous examples have shown that when using the inverse cosine function
to solve equations of the form cos.x/ D a number, it is easier to use the interval
≈í ; ¬ç rather than the interval ≈í0; 2¬ç. This is not necessarily true when using the
inverse
h  sine
i function since the inverse sine function gives a value in the interval
;
. However, to keep things similar, we will continue to use the interval

≈í ; ¬ç as the complete period for the sine (or cosine) function. For the inverse
sine, we use the following property stated on page 147.

it is actually easier to work with the equation sin.x/ D 0:6. This is because if
x D a is a solution of the equation sin.x/ D 0:6, then
sin. a/ D

sin.a/ D

0:6;

and so, x D a is a solution of the equation sin.x/ D 0:6. For the equation
sin.x/ D 0:6, we start by ‚Äúapplying the inverse sine function‚Äù to both sides of the
equation.

in the first quadrant and there is another solution in the second quadrant. Using
x D sin 1 .0:6/ as a reference arc (angle), the solution in the second quadrant is
x D  sin 1 .0:6/. We now use the result that if x D a is a solution of the
equation sin.x/ D 0:6, then x D a is a solution of the equation sin.x/ D 0:6.
Please note that

Solving More Complicated Trigonometric Equations
We have now learned to solve equations of the form cos.x/ D q and sin.x/ D q,
where q is a real number and 1  q  1. We can use our ability to solve
these types of equations to help solve more complicated equations of the form
cos.f .x// D q or sin.f .x// D q where f is some function. The idea (which is
typical in mathematics) is to convert this more complicated problem to two simpler
problems. The idea is to:
1. Make the substitution t D f .x/ to get an equation of the form cos.t / D q
or sin.t / D q.
2. Solve the equation in (1) for t .
3. For each solution t of the equation in (1), solve the equation f .x/ D t for
x. This step may be easy, difficult, or perhaps impossible depending on the
equation f .x/ D t .
This process will be illustrated in the next progress check, which will be a guided
investigation for solving the equation 3 cos.2x C 1/ C 6 D 5.

Solving Equations Involving the Tangent Function
Solving an equation of the form tan.x/ D q is very similar to solving equations
of the form cos.x/ D q or sin.x/ D q. The main differences are the tangent
function has a period of  (instead of 2), and the equation tan.x/ D q has only
one solution in a complete period. We, of course, use the inverse tangent function
for the equation tan.x/ D q.

Triangles and Vectors
As was stated at the start of Chapter 1, trigonometry had its origins in the study of
triangles. In fact, the word trigonometry comes from the Greek words for triangle
measurement. We will see that we can use the trigonometric functions to help
determine lengths of sides of triangles or the measure on angles in triangles. As we
will see in the last two sections of this chapter, triangle trigonometry is also useful
in the study of vectors.

Trigonometric Functions of Angles

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 How do we define the cosine and sine as functions of angles?
 How are the trigonometric functions defined on angles using circles of
any radius?

166

3.1. Trigonometric Functions of Angles

167

Beginning Activity
1. How do we define an angle whose measure is one radian? See the definition
on page 27.

2. Draw an angle in standard position with a measure of
radians. Draw an
4
5
angle in standard position with a measure of
radians.
3
3. What is the formula for the arc length s on a circle of radius r that is intercepted by an angle with radian measure  ? See page 36. Why does this
formula imply that radians are a dimensionless quantity and that a measurement in radians can be thought of as a real number?

Some Previous Results
In Section 1.2, we defined the cosine function and the sine function using the unit
circle. In particular, we learned that we could define cos.t / and sin.t / for any real
number where the real number t could be thought of as the length of an arc on the
unit circle.
In Section 1.3, we learned that the radian measure of an angle is the length of
the arc on the unit circle that is intercepted by the angle. That is,
An angle (in standard position) of t radians will correspond to an arc
of length t on the unit circle, and this allows us to think of cos.t / and
sin.t / when t is the radian measure of an angle.
So when we think of cos.t / and sin.t / (and the other trigonometric functions), we
can consider t to be:
 a real number;
 the length of an arc with initial point .1; 0/ on the unit circle;
 the radian measure of an angle in standard position.
Figure 3.1 shows an arc on the unit circle with the corresponding angle.

Figure 3.1: An Angle in Standard Position with the Unit Circle

Trigonometric Functions of an Angle
With the notation in Figure 3.1, we see that cos.t / D x and sin.t / D y. In this
context, we often call the cosine and sine circular functions because they are defined by points on the unit circle. Now we want to focus on the perspective of the
cosine and sine as functions of angles. When using this perspective we will refer to
the cosine and sine as trigonometric functions. Technically, we have two different
types of cosines and sines: one defined as functions of arcs and the other as functions of angles. However, the connection is so close and the distinction so minor
that we will often interchange the terms circular and trigonometric. One notational
item is that when we think of the trigonometric functions as functions of angles,
we often use Greek letters for the angles. The most common ones are  (theta), Àõ
(alpha), Àá (beta), and  (phi).
Although the definition of the trigonometric functions uses the unit circle, it
will be quite useful to expand this idea to allow us to determine the cosine and sine
of angles related to circles of any radius. The main concept we will use to do this
will be similar triangles. We will use the triangles shown in Figure 3.2.
In this figure, the angle  is in standard position, the point P .u; v/ is on the
unit circle, and the point Q is on a circle of radius r. So we see that
cos. / D u and

sin. / D v:

We will now use the triangles 4PAO and 4QBO to write cos. / and sin. / in
terms of x, y, and r. Figure 3.3 shows these triangles by themselves without the
circles.
The two triangles in Figure 3.2 are similar triangles since the corresponding
angles of the two triangles are equal. (See page 421 in Appendix C.) Because of

trigonometric functions of that angle.

Perhaps the most important identity for the circular functions is the so-called Pythagorean

It should not be surprising that this identity also holds for the trigonometric functions when we consider these to be functions of angles. This will be verified in the

The Inverse Trigonometric Functions
In Section 2.5, we studied the inverse trigonometric functions when we considered
the trigonometric (circular) functions to be functions of a real number t . At the start
of this section, however, we saw that t could also be considered to be the length
of an arc on the unit circle, or the radian measure of an angle in standard position.
At that time, we were using the unit circle to determine the radian measure of an
angle but now we can use any point on the terminal side of the angle to determine
the angle. The important thing is that these are now functions of angles and so
we can use the inverse trigonometric functions to determine angles. We can use
either radian measure or degree measure for the angles. The results we need are
summarized below.

The important things to remember are that an equation involving the inverse trigonometric function can be translated to an equation involving the corresponding trigonometric function and that the angle must be in a certain range. For example, if we

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 How does the cosine relate sides and acute angles in a right triangle?
Why?
 How does the sine relate sides and acute angles in a right triangle? Why?
 How does the tangent relate sides and acute angles in a right triangle?
Why?
 How can we use the cosine, sine, and tangent of an angle in a right
triangle to help determine unknown parts of that triangle?

Beginning Activity
The following diagram shows a typical right triangle. The lengths of the three
sides of the right triangle are labeled as a, b, and c. The angles opposite the sides
of lengths a, b, and c are labeled Àõ (alpha), Àá (beta), and (gamma), repsectively.
(Alpha, beta, and gamma are the first three letters in the Greek alphabet.) The small
square with the angle indicates that this is the right angle in the right triangle.
The triangle, of course, has three sides. We call the side opposite the right angle
(the side of length c in the diagram) the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
When we work with triangles, the angles are usually measured in degrees and
so we would say that is an angle of 90ƒ± .
1. What can we conclude about a, b, and c from the Pythagorean Theorem?
When working with triangles, we usually measure angles in degrees. For the fractional part of the degree measure of an angle, we often used decimals but we also
frequently use minutes and seconds.

Introduction
Suppose you want to find the height of a tall object such as a flagpole (or a tree or
a building). It might be inconvenient (or even dangerous) to climb the flagpole and
measure it, so what can you do? It might be easy to measure the length the shadow
the flagpole casts and also the angle  determined by the ground level to the sun
(called the angle of elevation of the object) as in Figure 3.5. In this section, we
will learn how to use the trigonometric functions to relate lengths of sides to angles
in right triangles and solve this problem as well as many others.

Trigonometric Functions and Right Triangles

of the terminal side of angle  with a circle of radius r. Then

In our work with right triangles, we will use only the sine, cosine, and tangent
functions.
Now we will see how to relate the trigonometric functions to angles in right
triangles. Suppose we have a right triangle with sides of length x and y and hypotenuse of length r. Let  be the angle opposite the side of length y as shown
in Figure 3.6. We can now place our triangle such that the angle  is in standard
position in the plane and the triangle will fit into the circle of radius r as shown at
right in Figure 3.7.
By the definition of our trigonometric functions we then have
x
y
y
cos. / D
sin. / D
tan. / D

If instead of using x, y, and r, we label y as the length of the side opposite the
acute angle  , x as the length of the side adjacent to the acute angle  , and r as the
length of the hypotenuse, we get the following figure:

Example 3.8 Suppose that one of the acute angles of a right triangle has a measure
of 35ƒ± and that the side adjacent to this angle is 8 inches long. Determine the other
acute angle of the right triangle and the lengths of the other two sides.
Solution. The first thing we do is draw a picture of the triangle. (The picture does
not have to be perfect but it should reasonably reflect the given information.) In
making the diagram, we should also label the unknown parts of the triangle. One
way to do this is shown in the diagram.

Before saying that this example is complete, we should check our results. One way
to do this is to verify that the lengths of the three sides of the right triangle satisfy
the formula for the Pythagorean Theorem. Using the given value for one side and
the calculated values of a and c, we see that
82 C a2  95:379
c 2  95:379

So we see that our work checks with the Pythagorean Theorem.

Solving Right Triangles
What we did in Example 3.8 is what is called solving a right triangle. Please
note that this phrase is misleading because you cannot really ‚Äúsolve‚Äù a triangle.
Unfortunately, this phrase is ensconced in the vernacular of trigonometry and so
we will continue to use it. The idea is that if we are given enough information
about the lengths of sides and measures of angles in a right triangle, then we can
determine all of the other values. The next progress check is also an example of
‚Äúsolving a right triangle.‚Äù

184

Progress Check 3.9 (Solving a Right Triangle)
The length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 17 feet and the length of one side
of this right triangle is 5 feet. Determine the length of the other side and the two
acute angles for this right triangle.
Hint: Draw a picture and label the third side of the right triangle with a variable
and label the two acute angles as Àõ and Àá.

Applications of Right Triangles
As the examples have illustrated up to this point, when working on problems involving right triangles (including application problems), we should:
 Draw a diagram for the problem.
 Identify the things you know about the situation. If appropriate, include this
information in your picture.
 Identify the quantity that needs to be determined and give this quantity a
variable name. If appropriate, include this information in your diagram.
 Find an equation that relates what is known to what must be determined. This
will often involve a trigonometric function or the Pythagorean Theorem.
 Solve the equation for the unknown. Then think about this solution to make
sure it makes sense in the context of the problem.
 If possible, find a way to check the result.
We return to the example given in the introduction to this section on page 179. In
this example, we used the term angle of elevation. This is a common term (as well
as angle of depression) in problems involving triangles. We can define an angle
of elevation of an object to be an angle whose initial side is horizontal and has a
rotation so that the terminal side is above the horizontal. An angle of depression is
then an angle whose initial side is horizontal and has a rotation so that the terminal
side is below the horizontal. See Figure 3.9.

Suppose that we want to determine the height of a flagpole and cannot measure the

to be 44 feet, 5 inches. In addition, we measure the angle of elevation of the sun to
be 33ƒ±150 .

So we can now determine the value of h, but we must be careful to use a decimal (or

A company needs to build a wheelchair accessible ramp to its entrance. The Americans with Disabilities Act Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities for ramps state
the ‚ÄúThe maximum slope of a ramp in new construction shall be 1:12.‚Äù
1. The 1:12 guideline means that for every 1 foot of rise in the ramp there must
be 12 feet of run. What is the angle of elevation (in degrees) of such a ramp?
2. If the company‚Äôs entrance is 7.5 feet above the level ground, use trigonometry to approximate the length of the ramp that the company will need to build
using the maximum slope. Explain your process.

This is a variation of Example 3.19. Suppose that the flagpole sits on top a hill and
that we cannot directly measure the length of the shadow of the flagpole as shown
in Figure 3.19.
Some quantities have been labeled in the diagram. Angles Àõ and Àá are angles
of elevation to the top of the flagpole from two different points on level ground.
These points are d feet apart and directly in line with the flagpole. The problem

equation (3).
2. One of the terms in equation (3) has a denominator. Multiply both sides of
equation (3) by this denominator.

Introduction
In Section 3.2, we learned how to use the trigonometric functions and given information about a right triangle to determine other parts of that right triangle. Of
course, there are many triangles without right angles (these triangles are called
oblique triangles). Our next task is to develop methods to relate sides and angles
of oblique triangles. In this section, we will develop two such methods, the Law of
Sines and the Law of Cosines. In the next section, we will learn how to use these
methods in applications.
As with right triangles, we will want some standard notation when working
with general triangles. Our notation will be similar to the what we used for right
triangles. In particular, we will often let the lengths of the three sides of a triangle
be a, b, and c. The angles opposite the sides of length a, b, and c will be labeled
Àõ, Àá, and , respectively. See Figure 3.12.
We will sometimes label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C as shown
in Figure 3.12.

The Law of Sines
The first part of the beginning activity was meant to illustrate the Law of Sines.
Following is a formal statement of the Law of Sines.

The key to using the Law of Sines is that each equation involves 4 quantities, and
if we know 3 of these quantities, we can use the Law of Sines to determine the
fourth. These 4 quantities are actually two different pairs, where one element of a
pair is an angle and the other element of that pair is the length of the side opposite
that angle. In Figure 3.13,  and x form one such pair, and  and y are another
such pair. We can write the Law of Sines as follows:

Example 3.13 (Using the Law of Sines)
Suppose that the measures of two angles of a triangle are 25ƒ± and 51:3ƒ± and that
the side opposite the 25ƒ± angle is 12 feet long. We will use the Law of Sines to
determine the other three parts of the triangle. (Remember that we often say that we
are ‚Äúsolving the triangle.‚Äù) The first step is to draw a reasonable accurate diagram
of the triangle and label the parts. This is shown in the following diagram.

We notice that we know the values of the length of a side and its opposite angles
(a and Àõ). Since we also know the value of Àá, we can use the Law of Sines to

still need to determine and c. We will use the fact that the sum of the angles of a
triangle is equal to 180ƒ± to determine .

Chapter 3. Triangles and Vectors

Using the Law of Sines to Determine an Angle
As we have stated, an equation for the Law of Sines involves four quantities, two
angles and the lengths of the two sides opposite these angles. In the examples we
have looked at, two angles and one side has been given. We then used the Law of
Sines to determine the length of the other side.
We can run into a slight complication when we want to determine an angle
using the Law of Sines. This can occur when we are given the lengths of two sides
and the measure of an angle opposite one of these sides. The problem is that there
are two different angles between 0ƒ± and 180ƒ± that are solutions of an equation of
the form
sin. / D ‚Äúa number between 0 and 1‚Äù:
For example, consider the equation sin. / D 0:7. We can use the inverse sine
function to determine one solution of this equation, which is
1 D sin

.0:7/  44:427ƒ±:

The inverse sine function gives us the solution that is between 0ƒ± anbd 90ƒ±, that
is, the solution in the first quadrant. There is a second solution to this equation
in the second quadrant, that is, between 90ƒ± and 180ƒ±. This second solution is
2 D 180ƒ± 1 . So in this case,

The next two progress checks will be guided activities through examples where we
will need to use the Law of Sines to determine an angle.
Progress Check 3.15 (Using the Law of Sines for an Angle)
Suppose a triangle has a side of length 2 feet that is an adjacent side for an angle of
40ƒ± . Is it possible for the side opposite the 40ƒ± angle to have a length of 1.7 feet?
To try to answer this, we first draw a reasonably accurate diagram of the situation as shown below.

The horizontal line is not a side of the triangle (yet). For now, we are just using it as
one of the sides of the 40ƒ± angle. In addition, we have not drawn the side opposite
the 40ƒ± angle since just by observation, it appears there could be two possible ways
to draw a side of length 3 feet. Now we get to the details.

1. Let  be the angle opposite the side of length 2 feet. Use the Law of Sines
to determine sin. /.
2. Use the inverse sine function to determine one solution (rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree) for  . Call this solution 1 .
3. Let 2 D 180ƒ± 1 . Explain why (or verify that) 2 is also a solution of the
equation in part (1).
This means that there could be two triangles that satisfy the conditions of the problem.
4. Determine the third angle and the third side when the angle opposite the side
of length 2 is 1 .
5. Determine the third angle and the third side when the angle opposite the side
of length 2 is 2 .
There are times when the Law of Sines will show that there are no triangles
that meet certain conditions. We often see this when an equation the Law of Sines
produces an equation of the form
sin. / D p;
where p is real number but is not between 0 and 1. For example, changing the
conditions in Progress Check 3.15 so that we want a triangle that has a side of
length 2 feet that is an adjacent side for an angle of 40ƒ± and the side opposite the
40ƒ± angle is to have a length of 1 foot. As in Progress Check 3.15, we let  be the
angle opposite the side of length 2 feet and use the Law of Sines to obtain

2 feet that is an adjacent side for an
t
angle of 40ƒ±. Is it possible for the side

opposite the 40 angle to have a length

The only difference between this and Progress Check 3.15 is in the length of
the side opposite the 40ƒ± angle. We can use the same diagram. By observation, it
appears there is likely only way to draw a side of length 3 feet. Now we get to the
details.
1. Let  be the angle opposite the side of length 2 feet. Use the Law of Sines
to determine sin. /.
2. Use the inverse sine function to determine one solution (rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree) for  . Call this solution 1 .
3. Let 2 D 180ƒ± 1 . Explain why (or verify that) 2 is also a solution of the

This means that there could be two triangles that satisfy the conditions of the problem.
4. Determine the third angle and the third side when the angle opposite the side
of length 2 is 1 .
5. Determine the third angle when the angle opposite the side of length 2 is 2 .
Now determine the sum 40ƒ± C 2 and explain why this is not possible in a
triangle.

Law of Cosines
We have seen how the Law of Sines can be used to determine information about
sides and angles in oblique triangles. However, to use the Law of Since we need
to know three pieces of information. We need to know an angle and the length of
its opposite side, and in addition, we need to know another angle or the length of
another side. If we have three different pieces of information such as the lengths
of two sides and the included angle between them or the lengths of the three sides,
then we need a different method to determine the other pieces of information about
the triangle. This is where the Law of Cosines is useful.

3.3. Triangles that Are Not Right Triangles

199

We first explored the Law of Cosines in the beginning activity for this section.
Following is the usual formal statement of the Law of Cosines. The proof of the
Law of Cosines is included at the end of this section.

As with the Law of Sines, there are three equations in the Law of Sines. However, we can remember this with only one equation since the key to using the Law
of Cosines is that this law involves 4 quantities. These 4 quantities are the lengths
of the three sides and the measure of one of the angles of the triangle as shown in
Figure 3.14.

Figure 3.14: Diagram for the Law of Cosines

In this diagram, x, y, and z are the lengths of the three sides and  is the angle
between the sides x and y. Theta can also be thought of as the angle opposite side
z. So we can write the Law of Cosines as follows:

200

 is the angle between the sides x and y as in Figure 3.14, then
z2 D x2 C y 2

2xy cos. /:

The idea is that if you know 3 of these 4 quantities, you can use the Law of
Cosines to determine the fourth quantity. The Law of Cosines involves the lengths
of all three sides of a triangle and one angle. It states that:
The square of the side opposite an angle is the sum of the squares of the two
sides of the angle minus two times the product of the two sides of the angle
and the cosine of the angle.
We will explore the use of the Law of Cosines in the next progress check.
Progress Check 3.17 (Using the Law of Cosines

by these two sides has a measure of 60ƒ± . Determine the other parts of the triangle.

The first step is to draw a reasonably

1. Use the Law of Cosines to determine the length of the side opposite the 60ƒ±

We now know an angle (60ƒ± ) and the length of its opposite side. We can use the
Law of Sines to determine the other two angles. However, remember that we must
be careful when using the Law of Sines to determine an angle since the equation
may produce two angles.
2. Use the Law of Sines to determine sin.Àõ/. Determine the two possible values
for Àõ and explain why one of them is not possible.
3. Use the fact that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180ƒ± to determine the
angle Àá.

3.3. Triangles that Are Not Right Triangles

201

4. Use the Law of Sines to check the results.
We used the Law of Sines to determine two angles in Progress Check 3.17 and
saw that we had to be careful since the equation for the Law of Sines often produces
two possible angles. We can avoid this situation by using the Law of Cosines to
determine the angles instead. This is because an equation of the form cos. / D p,
where p is a real number betweeen 0 and 1 has only one solution for  between 0ƒ±
and 180ƒ±. The idea is to solve an equation from the Law of Cosines for the cosine
of the angle. In Progress Check 3.17, we first determined c 2 D 3:12250. We then
could have proceeded as follows:
2:52 D 3:52 C 3:122502

21:8575
We can then use the inverse cosine function and obtain Àõ  43:898ƒ± , which is
what we obtained in Progress Check 3.17.
We can now use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180ƒ± to determine Àá but for completeness, we could also use the Law of Cosines to determine
Àá and then use the angle sum for the triangle as a check on our work.
Progress Check 3.18 (Using the Law of Cosines)
The three sides of a triangle have lengths of 3 feet, 5 feet, and 6 feet. Use the Law
of Cosines to determine each of the three angles.

Appendix ‚Äì Proof of the Law of Sines
We will use what we know about right triangles to prove the Law of Sines. The key
idea is to create right triangles from the diagram for a general triangle by drawing
an altitude of length h from one of the vertices. We first note that if Àõ, Àá, and are
the three angles of a triangle, then
ÀõCÀáC

D 180ƒ± :

This means that at most one of the three angles can be an obtuse angle (between
90ƒ± and 180ƒ±), and hence, at least two of the angles must be acute (less than 90ƒ±).
Figure 3.15 shows the two possible cases for a general triangle. The triangle on the
left has three acute angles and the triangle on the right has two acute angles (Àõ and
Àá) and one obtuse angle ( ).

We will now prove the Law of Sines for the case where all three angles of the

the diagram for a general triangle by drawing altitudes in the triangle as shown in
Figure 3.16 where an altitude of length h is drawn from the vertex of angle Àá and
an altitude of length k is drawn from the vertex of angle .

Appendix ‚Äì Proof of the Law of Cosines
As with the Law of Sines, we will use results about right triangles to prove the Law
of Cosines. We will also use the distance formula. We will start with a general
triangle with a, b, and c representing the lengths of the sides opposite the angles
Àõ, Àá, and , respectively. We will place the angle in standard position in the
coordinate system as shown in Figure 3.17.
In this diagram, the angle is shown as an obtuse angle but the proof would be
the same if was an acute angle. We have labeled the vertex of angle Àõ as A with
coordinates .x; y/ and we have drawn a line from A perpendicular to the x-axis.
So from the definitions of the trigonometric functions in Section 3.1, we see that

This proves one of the equations in the Law of Cosines. The other two equations
can be proved in the same manner by placing each of the other two angles in standard position.

Summary of Section 3.3
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:
The Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines can be used to determine the lengths of

Applications of Triangle Trigonometry

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 How do we use the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines to help solve
applied problems that involve triangles?
 How do we determine the area of a triangle?
 What is Heron‚Äôs Law for the area of a triangle?
In Section 3.2, we used right triangles to solve some applied problems. It
should then be no surprise that we can use the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines
to solve applied problems involving triangles that are not right triangles.
In most problems, we will first get a rough diagram or picture showing the
triangle or triangles involved in the problem. We then need to label the known
quantities. Once that is done, we can see if there is enough information to use the
Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines. Remember that each of these laws involves
four quantities. If we know the value of three of those four quantities, we can use
that law to determine the fourth quantity.
We begin with the example in Progress Check 3.12. The solution of this problem involved some complicated work with right triangles and some algebra. We
will now solve this problem using the results from Section 3.3.
Example 3.19 (Height to the Top of a Flagpole)
Suppose that the flagpole sits on top a hill and that we cannot directly measure the
length of the shadow of the flagpole as shown in Figure 3.19.
Some quantities have been labeled in the diagram. Angles Àõ and Àá are angles
of elevation to the top of the flagpole from two different points on level ground.
These points are d feet apart and directly in line with the flagpole. The problem
is to determine h, the height from level ground to the top of the flagpole. The
following measurements have been recorded.

We notice that if we knew either length BC or BD in 4BDC , then we could use
right triangle trigonometry to determine the length BC , which is equal to h. Now
look at 4ABC . We are given one angle Àá. However, we also know the measure
of angle Àõ. Because they form a straight angle, we have
‚Ä†ABC C Àõ D 180ƒ±:
Hence, ‚Ä†ABC D 180ƒ± 43:2ƒ± D 136:8ƒ±. We now know two angles in 4ABC
and hence, we can determine the third angle as follows:
Àá C ‚Ä†ABC C ‚Ä†ACB D 180ƒ±

34:7ƒ± C 136:8ƒ± C ‚Ä†ACB D 180ƒ±

of a triangle are 5 meters and 7 meters

and that the angle formed by these two
26.5

sides is 26:5 . See the diagram on the

For this problem, we are using the side of length 7 meters as the base. The altitude
of length h that is perpendicular to this side is shown.
1. Use right triangle trigonometry to determine the value of h.
2. Determine the area of this triangle.

The purpose of Progress Check 3.21 was to illustrate that if we know the length
of two sides of a triangle and the angle formed by these two sides, then we can
determine the area of that triangle.
The Area of a Triangle
The area of a triangle equals one-half the product of two of its sides times the
sine of the angle formed by these two sides.

There is another common formula for the area of a triangle known as Heron‚Äôs
Formula named after Heron of Alexandria (circa 75 CE). This formula shows that
the area of a triangle can be computed if the lengths of the three sides of the triangle
are known.

Chapter 3. Triangles and Vectors

Vectors from a Geometric Point of View

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What is a vector?
 How do we use the geometric form of vectors to find the sum of two
vectors?
 How do we use the geometric form of vectors to find a scalar multiple
of a vector?
 How do we use the geometric form of vectors to find the difference of
two vectors?
 What is the angle between two vectors?
 Why is force a vector and how do we use vectors and triangles to determine forces acting on an object?
We have all had the experience of dropping something and watching it fall to
the ground. What is happening, of course, is that the force of gravity is causing the
object to fall to the ground. In fact, we experience the force of gravity everyday
simply by being on Earth. Each person‚Äôs weight is a measure of the force of gravity
since pounds are a unit of force. So when a person weighs 150 pounds, it means
that gravity is exerting a force of 150 pounds straight down on that person. Notice
that we described this with a quantity and a direction (straight down). Such a
quantity (with magnitude and direction) is called a vector.
Now suppose that person who weighs 150 pounds is standing on a hill. In
mathematics, we simplify the situation and say that the person is standing on an
inclined plane as shown in Figure 3.20. (By making the hill a straight line, we
simplify the mathematics involved.) The diagram in Figure 3.20, an object is on
the inclined plane at the point P . The inclined plane makes an angle of  with the
horizontal. The vector w shows the weight of the object (force of gravity, straight
down). The diagram also shows two other vectors. The vector b is perpendicular

to the plane represents the force that the object exerts on the plane. The vector a
is perpendicular to b and parallel to the inclined plane. This vector represents the
force of gravity along the plane. In this and the next section, we will learn more
about these vectors and how to determine the magnitudes of these vectors. We will
also see that with our definition of the addition of two vectors that w D a C b.

Definitions
There are some quantities that require only a number to describe them. We call this
number the magnitude of the quantity. One such example is temperature since we
describe this with only a number such as 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Other such quantities are length, area, and mass. These types of quantities are often called scalar
quantities. However, there are other quantities that require both a magnitude and
a direction. One such example is force, and another is velocity. We would describe
a velocity with something like 45 miles per hour northwest. Velocity and force are
examples of a vector quantity. Other examples of vectors are acceleration and
displacement.
Some vectors are closely associated with scalars. In mathematics and science,
we make a distinction between speed and velocity. Speed is a scalar and we would
say something like our speed is 65 miles per hour. However, if we used a velocity,
we would say something like 65 miles per hour east. This is different than a velocity of 65 miles per hour north even though in both cases, the speed is 65 miles per
hour.
Definition. A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. A
scalar is a quantity that has magnitude only.

220

Chapter 3. Triangles and Vectors

Geometric Representation of Vectors
Vectors can be represented geometrically by arrows (directed line segments). The arrowhead indicates the
direction of the vector, and the length
of the arrow describes the magnitude
of the vector. A vector with initial
point P (the tail of the arrow) and terminal point Q (the tip of the arrowhead) can be represented by

terminal point
Q
v
P
initial point

!
PQ; v; or !
v:
!
We often write v D PQ. In this text, we will use boldface font to designate a
vector. When writing with pencil and paper, we always use an arrow above the
letter (such as !
v ) to designate a vector. The magnitude (or norm or length) of
the vector v is designated by jvj. It is important to remember that jvj is a number
that represents the magnitude or length of the vector v.
According to our definition, a vector possesses the attributes of length (magnitude) and direction, but position is not mentioned. So we will consider two vectors
to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. For example, if two
different cars are both traveling at 45 miles per hour northwest (but in different
locations), they have equal velocity vectors. We make a more formal definition.
Definition. Two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same magnitude
and the same direction. When the vectors v and w are equal, we write v D w.

Operations on Vectors
Scalar Multiple of a Vector
Doubling a scalar quantity is simply a matter of multiplying its magnitude by 2.
For example, if a container has 20 ounces of water and the amount of water is
doubled, it will then have 40 ounces of water. What do we mean by doubling a
vector? The basic idea is to keep the same direction and multiply the magnitude by
2. So if an object has a velocity of 5 feet per second southeast and a second object
has a velocity of twice that, the second object will have a velocity of 10 feet per
second in the southeast direction. In this case, we say that we multiplied the vector
by the scalar 2. We now make a definition that also takes into account that a scalar
can be negative.

Definition. For any vector v and any scalar c, the vector cv (called a scalar
multiple of the vector v) is a vector whose magnitude is jcj times the magnitude of the vector v.
 If c > 0, then the direction of cv is the same as the directionof v.
 If c < 0, then the direction of cv is the oppositie of the direction of v.
 If c D 0, then cv D 0v D 0.
The vector 0 is called the zero vector and the zero vector has no magnitude
!
and no direction. We sometimes write 0 for the zero vector.

Note: In this definition, jcj is the absolute value of the scalar c. Care must be taken
not to confuse this with the notation jvj, which is the magnitude of the vector v.
This is one reason it is important to have a notation that clearly indicates when we
are working with a vector or a scalar.

Addition of Vectors
We illustrate how to add vectors with two displacement vectors. As with velocity
and speed, there is a distinction between displacement and distance. Distance is a
scalar. So we might say that we have traveled 2 miles. Displacement, on the other
hand, is a vector consisting of a distance and a direction. So the vectors 2 miles
north and 2 miles east are different displacement vectors.

222

Chapter 3. Triangles and Vectors
Now if we travel 3 miles north and then
travel 2 miles east, we end at a point that
defines a new displacement vector. See
the diagram to the right. In this diagram,
u is ‚Äú3 miles north‚Äù and v is ‚Äú2 miles
east.‚Äù The vector sum u C v goes from
the initial point of u to the terminal point
of v.

v

u

u+v

Definition. The sum of two vectors is defined as follows: We position the
vectors so that the initial point of w coincides with the terminal point of v.
The vector v C w is the vector whose initial point coincides with the initial
point of v and whos terminal point coincides with the terminal point of w.
w

v+w
v

The vector v C w is called the sum or resultant of the vectors v and w.
In the definition, notice that the vectors v, w, and v C w are placed so that the result
is a triangle. The lengths of the sides of that triangle are the magnitudes of these
sides jvj, jwj, and jv C wj. If we place the two vectors v and w so that their initial
points coincide, we can use a parallelogram to add the two vectors. This is shown
in Figure 3.21.

We want something similar for vectors. For a vector w, the idea is to use
the scalar multiple . 1/w. The vector . 1/w has the same magnitude as
w but has the opposite direction of w.
We define w to be . 1/w. Figure
shows that when we add w to w, the
terminal point of the sum is the same
as the initial point of the sum and so
the result is the zero vector. That is,
w C . w/ D 0.

w

Subtraction of Vectors
Before explaining how to subtract vectors, we will first explain what is meant by the
‚Äúnegative of a vector.‚Äù This works similarly to the negative of a real number. For
example, we know that when we add 3 to 3, the result is 0. That is, 3 C . 3/ D 0.

Figure 3.22: The Sum of a Vector
and Its Negative

We are now in a position to define subtraction of vectors. The idea is much

224

Chapter 3. Triangles and Vectors

the same as subtraction of real numbers in that for any two real numbers a and b,
a b D a C . b/.
Definition. For any two vectors v and w, the difference between v and w is
denoted by v w and is defined as follows:
v

The Angle Between Two Vectors
We have seen that we can use triangles to help us add or subtract two vectors. The
lengths of the sides of the triangle are the magnitudes of certain vectors. Since we

3.5. Vectors from a Geometric Point of View

225

are dealing with triangles, we will also use angles determined by the vectors.
Definition. The angle  between vectors is the angle formed by these two
vectors (with 0ƒ±    180ƒ± ) when they have the same initial point.
So in the diagram on the left in Figure 3.23, the angle  is the angle between
the vectors v and w. However, when we want to determine the sum of two angles,
we often form the parallelogram determined by the two vectors as shown in the
diagram on the right in Figure 3.23. (See page 422 in Appendix C for a summary
of properties of a parallelogram.) We then will use the angle 180ƒ±  and the Law
of Cosines since we the two sides of the triangle are the lengths of v and w and the
included angle is 180ƒ±  . We will explore this in the next progress check.

3. Determine the measure of the angle between a and a C b. This is ‚Ä†CAB in

Force
An important vector quantity is that of force. In physics, a force on an object is
defined as any interaction that, when left unopposed, will change the motion of the
object. So a force will cause an object to change its velocity, that is the object will
accelerate. More informally, a force is a push or a pull on an object.
One force that affects our lives is the force of gravity. The magnitude of the
force of gravity on a person is that person‚Äôs weight. The direction of the force of
gravity is straight down. So if a person who weighs 150 pounds is standing still on
the ground, then the ground is also exerting a force of 150 pounds on the person
in the upward direction. The net force on the stationary person is zero. This is
an example of what is known as static equilibrium. When an object is in static
equilibrium, the sum of the forces acting on the object is equal to the zero vector.
Example 3.28 (Object Suspended from a Ceiling)
Suppose a 100 pound object is suspended from the ceiling by two
ceiling
wires that form a 40ƒ± angle as shown
in the diagram to the right. Because
the object is stationary, the two wires
must exert a force on the object so
40o
that the sum of these two forces
is equal to 100 pounds straight up.
100 pound object
(The force of gravity is 100 pounds
straight down.)

3.5. Vectors from a Geometric Point of View

227

We will assume that the two wires
exert an forces of equal magnitudes
and that the angle between these
forces and the vertical in 20ƒ± . So our
first step is to draw a picture of these
forces, which is shown on the right.
The vector v is a vector of magnitude
100 pounds. The vectors a and b are
the vectors for the forces exerted by
the two wires. (We have jaj D jbj.)

Inclined Planes
At the beginning of this section, we discussed the forces involved when an object
is place on an inclined plane. Figure 3.25 is the diagram we used, but we now have
added labels for some of the angles. Recall that the vector w shows the weight
of the object (force of gravity, straight down), the vector b is perpendicular to the
plane and represents the force that the object exerts on the plane, and the vector a
is perpendicular to b and parallel to the inclined plane. This vector represents the
force of gravity along the plane. Notice that we have also added a second copy of
the vector a that begins at the tip of the vector b.

Progress Check 3.30 (A Problem Involving an Inclined Plane)
An object that weighs 250 pounds is placed on an inclined plane that makes an angle of 12ƒ± degrees with the horizontal. Using a diagram like the one in Figure 3.26,
determine the magnitude of the force against the plane caused by the object and the
magnitude of the force down the plane on the object due to gravity. Note: The magnitude of the force down the plane will be the force in the direction up the plane
that is required to keep the object stationary.

Summary of Section 3.5
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:

Vectors and Scalars
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. a scalar is a quantity
that has magnitude only. Two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same
magnitude and the same direction.

Scalar Multiple of a Vector
For any vector v and any scalar c, the vector cv (called a scalar multiple of the
vector v) is a vector whose magnitude is jcj times the magnitude of the vector v.

3.5. Vectors from a Geometric Point of View

229

 If c > 0, then the direction of cv is the same as the directionof v.
 If c < 0, then the direction of cv is the oppositie of the direction of v.
 If c D 0, then cv D 0v D 0.
The vector 0 is called the zero vector and the zero vector has no magnitude and no
!
direction. We sometimes write 0 for the zero vector.

The Sum of Two Vectors
The sum of two vectors is defined as follows: We position the vectors so that the
initial point of w coincides with the terminal point of v. The vector v C w is the
vector whose initial point coincides with the initial point of v and whos terminal
point coincides with the terminal point of w.
w

v+w
v

The vector v C w is called the sum or resultant of the vectors v and w.

The Angle Between Two Vectors
The angle  between vectors is the angle formed by these two vectors (with 0ƒ± 
  180ƒ± ) when they have the same initial point.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 How do we find the component form of a vector?
 How do we find the magnitude and the direction of a vector written in
component form?
 How do we add and subtract vectors written in component form and how
do we find the scalar product of a vector written in component form?
 What is the dot product of two vectors?
 What does the dot product tell us about the angle between two vectors?
 How do we find the projection of one vector onto another?

Introduction and Terminology
y
We have seen that a vector is completely determined by magnitude and
direction. So two vectors that have
the same magnitude and direction are
equal. That means that we can position our vector in the plane and identify it in different ways. For one, we
can place the tip of a vector v at the
origin and the tail will wind up at
some point .v1 ; v2 / as illustrated in
Figure 3.27:

and is represent by v D hv1 ; v2 i. Please note the important distinction in notation
between the vector v D hv1 ; v2 i and the point .v1 ; v2 /. The coordinates of the
terminal point .v1 ; v2 / are called the components of the vector v. We call v D
hv1 ; v2 i the component form of the vector v. The first coordinate v1 is called the
x-component or the horizontal component of the vector v, and the first coordinate
v2 is called the y-component or the vertical component of the vector v. The
nonnegative angle  between the vector and the positive x-axis (with 0   <
360ƒ± ) is called the direction angle of the vector. See Figure 3.27.

Using Basis Vectors
y

There is another way to algebraically
write a vector if the components of the
vector are known. This uses the so-called
standard basis vectors for vectors in the
plane. These two vectors are denoted by
i and j and are defined as follows and are
shown in the diagram to the right.

Chapter 3. Triangles and Vectors

This is often called the i; j form of a vector, and the real number a is called the
i-component of v and the real number b is called the j-component of v

Algebraic Formulas for Geometric Properties of a Vector
y
Vectors have certain geometric properties
such as length and a direction angle. With
the use of the component form of a vector,
we can write algebraic formulas for these
properties. We will use the diagram to the

Operations on Vectors
In Section 3.5, we learned how to add two vectors and how to multiply a vector by
a scalar. At that time, the descriptions of these operations was geometric in nature.
We now know about the component form of a vector. So a good question is, ‚ÄúCan
we use the component form of vectors to add vectors and multiply a vector by a
scalar?‚Äù
To illustrate the idea, we will look at
Progress Check 3.25 on page 223, where
we added two vectors v and w. Although
we did not use the component forms of
w
these vectors, we can now see that

v C w D ha C c; b C d i D .a C c/i C .b C d /j:
This means that we can add two vectors by adding their horizontal components
and by adding their vertical components. The next progress check will illustrate
something similar for scalar multiplication.

The Dot Product of Two Vectors
Finding optimal solutions to systems is an important problem in applied mathematics. It is often the case that we cannot find an exact solution that satisfies certain
constraints, so we look instead for the ‚Äúbest‚Äù solution that satisfies the constraints.
An example of this is fitting a least squares curve to a set of data like our calculators do when computing a sine regression curve. The dot product is useful in these
situations to find ‚Äúbest‚Äù solutions to certain types of problems. Although we won‚Äôt
see it in this course, having collections of perpendicular vectors is very important
in that it allows for fast and efficient computations. The dot product of vectors
allows us to measure the angle between them and thus determine if the vectors are
perpendicular. The dot product has many applications, e.g., finding components of
forces acting in different directions in physics and engineering. We introduce and
investigate dot products in this section.
We have seen how to add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, but we have
not yet introduced a product of vectors. In general, a product of vectors should give
us another vector, but there turns out to be no really useful way to define such a
product of vectors. However, there is a dot ‚Äúproduct‚Äù of vectors whose output is a
scalar instead of a vector, and the dot product is a very useful product (even though
it isn‚Äôt a product of vectors in a technical sense).
Recall that the magnitude (or length) of the vector u D hu1 ; u2i is
q
p
juj D u21 C u22 D u1 u1 C u2 u2 :

The expression under the second square root is an important one and we extend it
and give it a special name.
Definition. Let u D hu1 ; u2i and v D hv1 ; v2 i be vectors in the plane. The
dot product of u and v is the scalar
uv D u1 v1 C u2 v2 :
This may seem like a strange number to compute, but it turns out that the dot
product of two vectors is useful in determining the angle between two vectors.
Recall that in Progress Check 3.27 on page 225, we used the Law of Cosines to
determine the sum of two vectors and then used the Law of Sines to determine the
angle between the sum and one of those vectors. We have now seen how much
easier it is to compute the sum of two vectors when the vectors are in component
form. The dot product will allow us to determine the cosine of the angle between
two vectors in component form. This is due to the following result:

238

are there? Hint: Let v D ha; bi. Under what conditions will the angle
between u and v be 90ƒ±?

3.6. Vectors from an Algebraic Point of View

239

One purpose of Progress Check 3.34 was to use the formula
cos. / D

uv
:
jujjvj

to determine when two vectors are perpendicular. Two vectors u and v will be
perpendicular if and only if the angle  between them is 90ƒ±. Since cos .90ƒ±/ D 0,
we see that this formula implies that u and v will be perpendicular if and only if
uv D 0. (This is because a fraction will be equal to 0 only when the numerator is
equal to 0 and the denominator is not zero.) So we have
Two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is equal to 0.
Note: When two vectors are perpendicular, we also say that they are orthogonal.

Projections
Another useful application of the dot product is in finding the projection of one vector onto another. An example of where such a calculation is useful is the following.

Usain Bolt from Jamaica excited the world of track and field in 2008
with his world record performances on the track. Bolt won the 100
meter race in a world record time of 9.69 seconds. He has since bettered that time with a race of 9.58 seconds with a wind assistance of
0.9 meters per second in Berlin on August 16, 2009 The wind assistance is a measure of the wind speed that is helping push the runners
down the track. It is much easier to run a very fast race if the wind
is blowing hard in the direction of the race. So that world records
aren‚Äôt dependent on the weather conditions, times are only recorded
as record times if the wind aiding the runners is less than or equal to 2
meters per second. Wind speed for a race is recorded by a wind gauge
that is set up close to the track. It is important to note, however, that
weather is not always as cooperative as we might like. The wind does
not always blow exactly in the direction of the track, so the gauge must
account for the angle the wind makes with the track.
If the wind is blowing in the direction of the vector u and the track is in the direction
of the vector v in Figure 3.31, then only part of the total wind vector is actually
working to help the runners. This part is called the projection of the vector u
onto the vector v and is denoted projv u.

Trigonometric Identities and
Equations
Trigonometric identities describe equalities between related trigonometric expressions while trigonometric equations ask us to determine the specific values of the
variables that make two expressions equal. Identities are tools that can be used to
simplify complicated trigonometric expressions or solve trigonometric equations.
In this chapter we will prove trigonometric identities and derive the double and
half angle identities and sum and difference identities. We also develop methods
for solving trigonometric equations, and learn how to use trigonometric identities
to solve trigonometric equations.

Chapter 4. Trigonometric Identities and Equations

Consider the trigonometric equation sin.2x/ D cos.x/. Based on our current
knowledge, an equation like this can be difficult to solve exactly because the periods of the functions involved are different. What will allow us to solve this equation relatively easily is a trigonometric identity, and we will explicitly solve this
equation in a subsequent section. This section is an introduction to trigonometric
identities.
As we discussed in Section 2.6, a mathematical equation like x 2 D 1 is a
relation between two expressions that may be true for some values of the variable.
To solve an equation means to find all of the values for the variables that make the
two expressions equal to each other. An identity, is an equation that is true for all
allowable values of the variable. For example, from previous algebra courses, we
have seen that
x 2 1 D .x C 1/.x 1/;
for all real numbers x. This is an algebraic identity since it is true for all real
number values of x. An example of a trigonometric identity is
cos2 .x/ C sin2 .x/ D 1
since this is true for all real number values of x.
So while we solve equations to determine when the equality is valid, there
is no reason to solve an identity since the equality in an identity is always valid.
Every identity is an equation, but not every equation is an identity. To know that
an equation is an identity it is necessary to provide a convincing argument that the
two expressions in the equation are always equal to each other. Such a convincing
argument is called a proof and we use proofs to verify trigonometric identities.
Definition. An identity is an equation that is true for all allowable values of
the variables involved.

Some Known Trigonometric Identities
We have already established some important trigonometric identities. We can use
the following identities to help establish new identities.
The Pythagorean Identity
This identity is fundamental to the development of trigonometry. See page 18 in
Section 1.2.
For all real numbers t , cos2 .t / C sin2 .t / D 1.

Verifying Identities
Given two expressions, say tan2 .x/ C 1 and sec2 .x/, we would like to know if
they are equal (that is, have the same values for every allowable input) or not. We
can draw the graphs of y D tan2 .x/ C 1 and y D sec2 .x/ and see if the graphs
look the same or different. Even if the graphs look the same, as they do with y D
tan2 .x/C1 and y D sec2 .x/, that is only an indication that the two expressions are
equal for every allowable input. In order to verify that the expressions are in fact
always equal, we need to provide a convincing argument that works for all possible
input. To do so we use facts that we know (existing identities) to show that two
trigonometric expressions are always equal. As an example, we will verify that the
equation
tan2 .x/ C 1 D sec2 .x/
(1)
is an identity.
A proper format for this kind of argument is to choose one side of the equation
and apply existing identities that we already know to transform the chosen side into
the remaining side. It usually makes life easier to begin with the more complicated
looking side (if there is one). In our example of equation (1) we might begin with
the expression tan2 .x/ C 1.
Example 4.1 (Verifying a Trigonometric Identity)
To verify that equation (1) is an identity, we work with the expression tan2 .x/ C 1.
It can often be a good idea to write all of the trigonometric functions in terms of
sin.x/
the cosine and sine to start. In this case, we know that tan.x/ D
, so we
cos.x/
could begin by making this substitution to obtain the identity

Note that this is an identity and so is valid for all allowable values of the variable.

hand side of our identity (2).

Now we can recognize the Pythagorean identity cos2 .x/ C sin2 .x/ D 1, which
makes the right side of identity (4)

D
:
cos2 .x/

(5)

Recall that our goal is to verify identity (1), so we need to transform the expression
1
into sec2 .x/. Recall that sec.x/ D
, and so the right side of identity (5)
cos.x/
leads to the new identity
1
D sec2 .x/;
cos2 .x/
which verifies the identity.
An argument like the one we just gave that shows that an equation is an identity is called a proof. We usually leave out most of the explanatory steps (the steps
should be evident from the equations) and write a proof in one long string of identities as

To prove an identity is to show that the expressions on each side of the equation
are the same for every allowable input. We illustrated this process with the equation
tan2 .x/ C 1 D sec2 .x/. To show that an equation isn‚Äôt an identity it is enough to
demonstrate that the two sides of the equation have different values at one input.




is not an identity.
2
Example 4.2 illustrates an important point. to show that an equation is not an
identity, it is enough to find one input at which the two sides of the equation are
not equal. We summarize our work with identities as follows.
 To prove that an equation is an identity, we need to apply known identities to show that one side of the equation can be transformed into the
other.
 To prove that an equation is not an identity, we need to find one input
at which the two sides of the equation have different values.
Important Note: When proving an identity it might be tempting to start working
with the equation itself and manipulate both sides until you arrive at something you
know to be true. DO NOT DO THIS! By working with both sides of the equation,
we are making the assumption that the equation is an identity ‚Äì but this assumes
the very thing we need to show. So the proper format for a proof of a trigonometric
identity is to choose one side of the equation and apply existing identities that we
already know to transform the chosen side into the remaining side. It usually makes
life easier to begin with the more complicated looking side (if there is one).
Example 4.3 (Verifying an Identity)
Consider the equation
2 cos2 .x/

1 D cos2 .x/

sin2 .x/:

Graphs of both sides appear to indicate that this equation is an identity. To prove
the identity we start with the left hand side:

Notice that in our proof we rewrote the Pythagorean identity cos2 .x/Csin2 .x/ D 1
as cos2 .x/ D 1 sin2 .x/. Any proper rearrangement of an identity is also an
identity, so we can manipulate known identities to use in our proofs as well.

4.1. Trigonometric Identities

251

To reiterate, the proper format for a proof of a trigonometric identity is to
choose one side of the equation and apply existing identities that we already know
to transform the chosen side into the remaining side. There are no hard and fast
methods for proving identities ‚Äì it is a bit of an art. You must practice to become
good at it.

Summary of Section 4.1
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:
An identity is an equation that is true for all allowable values of the variables
involved.
 To prove that an equation is an identity, we need to apply known identities
to show that one side of the equation can be transformed into the other.
 To prove that an equation is not an identity, we need to find one input at
which the two sides of the equation have different values.

Exercises for Section 4.1
1. Use a graphing utility to graph each side of the given equation. If the equation appears to be an identity, prove the identity. If the equation appears to
not be an identity, demonstrate one input at which the two sides of the equation have different values. Remember that when proving an identity, work
to transform one side of the equation into the other using known identities.
Some general guidelines are
I. Begin with the more complicated side.

IV. As you transform one side of the equation, keep the other side of the
equation in mind and use identities that involve terms that are on the
other side. For example, to verify that tan2 .x/ C 1 D cos21.x/ , start
with tan2 .x/ C 1 and make use identities that relate tan.x/ to cos.x/ as
closely as possible.

solutions. Suppose we have a trigonometric equation for which both sides of

Trigonometric Equations

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What is a trigonometric equation?
 What does it mean to solve a trigonometric equation?
 How is a trigonometric equation different from a trigonometric identity?
We have already learned how to solve certain types of trigonometric equations. In Section 2.6 we learned how to use inverse trigonometric functions to
solve trigonometric equations.

Beginning Activity
Refer back to the method from Section 2.6 to find all solutions to the equation
sin.x/ D 0:4.

Trigonometric Equations
When a light ray from a point P reflects off a surface at a point R to illuminate a
point Q as shown at left in Figure 4.1, the light makes two angles Àõ and Àá with a
perpendicular to the surface. The angle Àõ is called the angle of incidence and the
angle Àá is called the angle of reflection. The Law of Reflection states that when
light is reflected off a surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
What happens if the light travels through one medium (say air) from a point P ,
deflects into another medium (say water) to travel to a point Q? Think about what
happens if you look at an object in a glass of water. See Figure 4.1 at right. Again
the light makes two angles Àõ and Àá with a perpendicular to the surface. The angle
Àõ is called the angle of incidence and the angle Àá is called the angle of refraction.
If light travels from air into water, the Law of Refraction says that

where ca is the speed of light in air and cw is the speed of light in water. The
ca
of the speed of light in air to the speed of light in water can be calculated
ratio
cw
by experiment. In practice, the speed of light in each medium is compared to the
speed of light in a vacuum. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed
of light in water is around 1.33. This is called the index of refraction for water. The
index of refraction for air is very close to 1, so the ratio ccwa is close to 1.33. We can
usually measure the angle of incidence, so the Law of Refraction can tells us what
the angle of refraction is by solving equation (6).
Trigonometric equations arise in a variety of situations, like in the Law of Refraction, and in a variety of disciplines including physics, chemistry, and engineering. As we develop trigonometric identities in this chapter, we will also use them
to solve trigonometric equations.
Recall that Equation (6) is a conditional equation because it is not true for all
allowable values of the variable. To solve a conditional equation means to find all
of the values for the variables that make the two expressions on either side of the
equation equal to each other.

Equations of Linear Type
Section 2.6 showed us how to solve trigonometric equations that are reducible to
linear equations. We review that idea in our first example.
Example 4.5 (Solving an Equation of Linear Type)
Consider the equation
2 sin.x/ D 1:
We want to find all values of x that satisfy this equation. Notice that this equation

4.2. Trigonometric Equations

255

looks a lot like the linear equation 2y D 1, with sin.x/ in place of y. So this
trigonometric equation is of linear type and we say that it is linear in sin.x/. We
know how to solve 2y D 1, we simply divide both sides of the equation by 2 to
1
obtain y D . We can apply the same algebraic operation to 2 sin.x/ D 1 to obtain
2
the equation
1
sin.x/ D :
2
Now we could proceed in a couple of ways. From previous work we know that
1

sin.x/ D when x D . Alternatively, we could apply the inverse sine to both
2
6
 

1 1
sides of our equation to see that one solution is x D sin
D .
2
6
Recall, however, this is not the only solution. The first task is to find all of the
solutions in one complete period of the sine function. We can use the interval with
0  x  2 but we often use the interval   x  . In this case, it makes no

difference since the sine function is positive in the second quadrant. Using as a
6

5
reference angle, we see that x D 
D
is another solution of this equation.
6
6
(Use a calculator to check this.)
We now use the fact that the sine function is period with a period of 2 to write
formulas that can be used to generate all solutions of the equation 2 sin.x/ D 1.

So the angles in the first quadrant are
C k.2/ and the angles in the second
6
5
quadrant are
Ck.2/, where k is an integer. So for the solutions of the equation
6
2 sin.x/ D 1, we write
xD


5
C k.2/ or x D
C k.2/;
6

where k is an integer.
We can always check our solutions by graphing both sides of the equation to see
where the two expressions intersect. Figure 4.2 shows that graphs of y D 2 sin.x/
and y D 1 on the interval ≈í 2; 3¬ç. We can see that the points of intersection of
these two curves occur at exactly the solutions we found for this equation.

then using the periodic property to write formulas that can be used to generate all

Solving an Equation Using an Inverse Function
When we solved the equation 2 sin.x/ D 1, we used the fact that we know that
 
1
sin
D . When we cannot use one of the common arcs, we use the more
6
2
general method of using an inverse trigonometric function. This is what we did in
Section 2.6. See ‚ÄúA Strategy for Solving a Trigonometric Function‚Äù on page 158.
We will illustrate this strategy with the equation cos.x/ D 0:7. We start by applying the inverse cosine function to both sides of this equation to obtain

cos

.cos.x/ D cos

This gives the one solution for the equation that is in interval ≈í0; ¬ç. Before we use
the periodic property, we need to determine the other solutions for the equation in
one complete period of the cosine function. We can use the interval ≈í0; 2¬ç but it
is easier to use the interval ≈í ; ¬ç. One reason for this is the following so-called
‚Äúnegative arc identity‚Äù stated on page 82.
cos. x/ D cos.x/ for every real number x:

4.2. Trigonometric Equations

257

Hence, since one solution for the equation is x D cos 1 .0:7/, another solution is
x D cos 1 .0:7/. This means that the two solutions of the equation x D cos.x/
on the interval ≈í ; ¬ç are

where k is an integer. We can write the solutions in approximate form as

Chapter 4. Trigonometric Identities and Equations

This equation is complicated by the fact that there are two different trigonometric
functions involved. In this case we use the Pythagorean Identity

by solving for cos2 .x/ to obtain
cos2 .x/ D 1

sin2 .x/:

We can now substitute into equation (7) to get

2 cos.x/ C 1 D 0:

This equation looks like a familiar quadratic equation y 2 2y C 1 D 0. We can
solve this quadratic equation by factoring to obtain .y 1/2 D 0. So we can apply
the same technique to the trigonometric equation cos2 .x/ 2 cos.x/ C 1 D 0.
Factoring the left hand side yields
.cos.x/

1/2 D 0:

The only way .cos.x/ 1/2 can be 0 is if cos.x/ 1 is 0. This reduces our

Summary of Section 4.2

A trigonometric equation is a conditional equation that involves trigonometric

‚Äúsome trigonometric function of x‚Äù D a number;

(1)

we can use the following strategy to solve the equation:
 Find all solutions of the equation within one period of the function. This is
often done by using properties of the trigonometric function. Quite often,
there will be two solutions within a single period.
 Use the period of the function to express formulas for all solutions by adding
integer multiples of the period to each solution found in the first step. For
example, if the function has a period of 2 and x1 and x2 are the only two

solutions in a complete period, then we would write the solutions for the
equation as
x D x1 C k.2/;

x D x2 C k.2/; where k is an integer:

3. X-ray crystallography is an important tool in chemistry. One application of
X-ray crystallography is to discover the atomic structure macromolecules.
For example, the double helical structure of DNA was found using X-ray
crystallography.
The basic idea behind X-ray crystallography is this: two X-ray beams with
the same wavelength  and phase are directed at an angle  toward a crystal
composed of atoms arranged in a lattice in planes separated by a distance d
as illustrated in Figure 4.5.1 The beams reflect off different atoms (labeled as
P and Q in Figure 4.5) within the crystal. One X-ray beam (the lower one as
1 The symbol 

262

Chapter 4. Trigonometric Identities and Equations
illustrated in Figure 4.5) must travel a longer distance than the other. When
reflected, the X-rays combine but, because of the phase shift of the lower
beam, the combination might have a small amplitude or a large amplitude.
Bragg‚Äôs Law states that the sum of the reflected rays will have maximum
amplitude when the extra length the longer beam has to travel is equal to an
integer multiple of the wavelength  of the radiation. In other words,
n D 2d sin. /;

The Cosine Difference Identity
To this point we know the exact values of the trigonometric functions at only a
few angles. Trigonometric identities can help us extend this list of angles at which
we know exact values of the trigonometric functions.
Consider, for example, the

problem of finding the exact value of cos
. The definitions and identities
12
we have so far do not help us with this problem. However, we could notice that

and if we knew how the cosine behaved with respect to the difference

of two angles, then we could find cos
. In our Beginning Activity, however,
12
we saw that the equation cos.A B/ D cos.A/ cos.B/ is not an identity, so we
need to understand how to relate cos.A B/ to cosines and sines of A and B.
We state the Cosine Difference Identity below. This identity is not obvious,
and a verification of the identity is given later in this section. For now we focus on
using the identity.

The Cosine Sum Identity
Since there is a Cosine Difference Identity, we might expect there to be a Cosine
Sum Identity. We can use the Cosine Difference Identity along with the negative
identities to find an identity for cos.A C B/. The basic idea was contained in our
last Progress Check, where we wrote A C B as A . B/. To see how this works
in general, notice that
cos.A C B/ D cos.A . B//
D cos.A/ cos. B/ C sin.A/ sin. B/
D cos.A/ cos.B/

sin.A/ sin.B/:

This is the Cosine Sum Identity.

are called cofunction identities. These two cofunction identities show that the sine
and cosine of the acute angles in a right triangle are related in a particular way.

266

Chapter 4. Trigonometric Identities and Equations

Since the sum of the measures of the angles in a right triangle is  radians or

180ƒ± , the measures of the two acute angles in a right triangle sum to radians or
2
90ƒ± . Such angles are said to be complementary. Thus, the sine of an acute angle
in a right triangle is the same as the cosine of its complementary angle. For this
reason we call the sine and cosine cofunctions. The naming of the six trigonometric
functions reflects the fact that they come in three sets of cofunction pairs: the sine
and cosine, the tangent and cotangent, and the secant and cosecant. The cofunction
identities are the same for any cofunction pair.

Appendix ‚Äì Proof of the Cosine Difference Identity
To understand how to calculate the cosine of the difference of two angles, let A
and B be arbitrary angles in radians. Figure 4.7 shows these angles with A > B,
but the argument works in general. If we plot the points where the terminal sides
of the angles A, B, and A B intersect the unit circle, we obtain the picture in
Figure 4.7.

The arc on the unit circle from the point .cos.B/; sin.B// to the point
.cos.A/; sin.A// has length A B, and the arc from the point (1,0) to the point
.cos.A B/; sin.A B// also has length A B. So the chord from .cos.B/; sin.B//

270

Chapter 4. Trigonometric Identities and Equations

to .cos.A/; sin.A// has the same length as the chord from (1,0) to
.cos.A B/; sin.A B//. To find the cosine difference formula, we calculate these
two chord lengths using the distance formula.
The length of the chord from .cos.B/; sin.B// to .cos.A/; sin.A// is
q
.cos.A/ cos.B//2 C .sin.A/ sin.B//2

and the length of the chord from (1,0) to .cos.A B/; sin.A B// is
q
.cos.A B/ 1/2 C .sin.A B/ 0/2 :

Since these two chord lengths are the same we obtain the equation

Double and Half Angle Identities

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What are the Double Angle Identities for the sine, cosine, and tangent?
 What are the Half Angle Identities for the sine, cosine, and tangent?
 What are the Product-to-Sum Identities for the sine and cosine?
 What are the Sum-to-Product Identities for the sine and cosine?
 Why are these identities useful?
The sum and difference identities can be used to derive the double and half
angle identities as well as other identities, and we will see how in this section.
Again, these identities allow us to determine exact values for the trigonometric
functions at more points and also provide tools for solving trigonometric equations
(as we will see later).

Beginning Activity
1. Use B D A in the Cosine Sum Identity
cos.A C B/ D cos.A/ cos.B/

sin.A/ sin.B/

to write cos.2A/ in terms of cos.A/ and sin.A/.
2. Is the equation
cos.2x/
D cos.x/

an identity? Verify your answer.

The Double Angle Identities
Suppose a marksman is shooting a gun with muzzle velocity v0 D 1200 feet per
second at a target 1000 feet away. If we neglect all forces acting on the bullet except

276

Chapter 4. Trigonometric Identities and Equations

the force due to gravity, the horizontal distance the bullet will travel depends on the
angle  at which the gun is fired. If we let r be this horizontal distance (called the
range), then
rD

v02
sin.2 /;
g

where g is the gravitational force acting to pull the bullet downward. In this context, g D 32 feet per second squared, giving us
r D 45000 sin.2 /:
The marksman would want to know the minimum angle at which he should fire
in order to hit the target 1000 feet away. In other words, the marksman wants to
determine the angle  so that r D 1000. This leads to solving the equation
45000 sin.2 / D 1000:

(3)

Equations like the range equation in which multiples of angles arise frequently,
and in this section we will determine formulas for cos.2A/ and sin.2A/ in terms
of cos.A/ and sin.A/. These formulas are called double angle identities. In our
Beginning Activity we found that
cos.2A/ D cos2 .A/

sin2 .A/

can be derived directly from the Cosine Sum Identity. A similar identity for the
sine can be found using the Sine Sum Identity:
sin.2A/ D sin.A C A/

D 2 cos.A/ sin.A/:

Solving Equations with Double Angles
Solving equations, like 45000 sin.2 / D 1000, that involve multiples of angles,
requires the same kind of techniques as solving other equations, but the multiple
angle can add another wrinkle.
Example 4.21 (Solving an Equation with a Multiple Angle)
Consider the equation
2 cos.2 / 1 D 0:

This is an equation that is linear in cos.2 /, so we can apply the same ideas as we
did earlier to this equation. We solve for cos.2 / to see that

cos.2 / D :

for integers k. These solutions are illustrated in Figure 4.9.

Progress Check 4.22 (Solving Equations with Double Angles)
Approximate the smallest positive solution in degrees, to two decimal places, to
the range equation
45000 sin.2 / D 1000:
We can also use the Double Angle Identities to solve equations with multiple
angles.
Example 4.23 (Solving an Equation with a Double Angle Identity)
Consider the equation
sin.2 / D sin. /:

The fact that the two trigonometric functions have different periods makes this
equation a little more difficult. We can use the Double Angle Identity for the sine
to rewrite the equation as
2 sin. / cos. / D sin. /:
At this point we may be tempted to cancel the factor of sin. / from both sides, but
we should resist that temptation because sin. / can be 0 and we can‚Äôt divide by 0.
Instead, let‚Äôs put everything one one side and factor:
2 sin. / cos. / D sin. /

2 sin. / cos. /

sin. / D 0

sin. /.2 cos. /

1/ D 0:

4.4. Double and Half Angle Identities

279

Now we have a product that is equal to 0, so at least one of the factors must be 0.
This yields the two equations
sin. / D 0 or cos. /

1 D 0:

We solve each equation in turn. We know that sin. / D 0 when  D k for
integers k. Also, cos. / 1 D 0 implies cos. / D 1, and this happens when
 D 2k for integers k. Notice that these solutions are a subset of the collection
k of solutions of sin. / D 0. Thus, the solutions to sin.2 / D sin. / are  D k

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this

these questions.
 What are the Product-to-Sum Identities for the sine and cosine?
 What are the Sum-to-Product Identities for the sine and cosine?
 Why are these identities useful?
In general, trigonometric equations are very difficult to solve exactly. We have
been using identities to solve trigonometric equations, but there are still many more
for which we cannot find exact solutions. Consider, for example, the equation
sin.3x/ C sin.x/ D 0:
The graph of y D sin.3x/ C sin.x/ is shown in Figure 4.11. We can see that
there are many solutions, but the identities we have so far do not help us with this
equation. What would make this equation easier to solve is if we could rewrite the
sum on the left as a product ‚Äì then we could use the fact that a product is zero if and
only if one of its factors is 0. We will later introduce the Sum-to-Product Identities
that will help us solve this equation.

probably done this many times in the past, solving equations like x 2 1 D 0

allows us to find all solutions to quadratic

and every complex number has this special form.
Definition. A complex number is an object of the form
a C bi;
where a and b are real numbers and i 2 D 1.
The form a C bi , where a and b are real numbers is called the standard form
for a complex number. When we have a complex number of the form z D a C bi ,
the number a is called the real part of the complex number z and the number b is
called the imaginary part of z. Since i is not a real number, two complex numbers
a C bi and c C d i are equal if and only if a D c and b D d .
There is an arithmetic of complex numbers that is determined by an addition
and multiplication of complex numbers. Adding and subtracting complex numbers
is natural:
.a C bi / C .c C d i / D .a C c/ C .b C d /i

.a C bi / C .c C d i / D .a C c/ C .b C d /i

5.1. The Complex Number System

297

That is, to add (or subtract) two complex numbers we add (subtract)their real parts
and add (subract) their imaginary parts. Multiplication is also done in a natural
way ‚Äì to multiply two complex numbers, we simply expand the product as usual
and exploit the fact that i 2 D 1. So the product of two complex number is
.a C bi /.c C d i / D ac C .ad /i C .bc/i C .bd /i 2
D .ac bd / C .ad C bc/i

It can be shown that the complex numbers satisfy many useful and familiar
properties, which are similar to properties of the real numbers. If u, w, and z, are
complex numbers, then
1. w C z D z C w
2. u C .w C z/ D .u C w/ C z
3. The complex number 0 D 0 C 0i is an additive identity, that is z C 0 D z.
4. If z D a C bi , then the additive inverse of z is z D . a/ C . b/i , That is,
z C . z/ D 0.
5. wz D zw
6. u.wz/ D .uw/z
7. u.w C z/ D uw C uz
8. If wz D 0, then w D 0 or z D 0.
We will use these properties as needed. For example, to write the complex
product .1 C i /i in the form a C bi with a and b real numbers, we distribute
multiplication over addition and use the fact that i 2 D 1 to see that
.1 C i /i D i C i 2 D i C . 1/ D . 1/ C i:

For another example, if w D 2 C i and z D 3 2i , we can use these properties to
write wz in the standard a C bi form as follows:

Geometric Representations of Complex Numbers

 A point in the coordinate plane with coordinates .a; b/.
 A complex number a C bi .
 A vector ai C bj D ha; bi.

300

Chapter 5. Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates

This means that we can geometrically represent the complex number a C bi with
a vector in standard position with terminal point .a; b/. Therefore, we can draw
pictures of complex numbers in the plane. When we do this, the horizontal axis is
called the real axis, and the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis. In addition,
the coordinate plane is then referred to as the complex plane. That is, if z D aCbi
we can think of z as a directed line segment from the origin to the point .a; b/,
where the terminal point of the segment is a units from the imaginary axis and b
units from the real axis. For example, the complex numbers 3 C 4i and 8 C 3i
are shown in Figure 5.1.

In addition, the sum of two complex numbers can be represented geometrically
using the vector forms of the complex numbers. Draw the parallelogram defined by
w D aCbi and z D cCd i . The sum of w and z is the complex number represented
by the vector from the origin to the vertex on the parallelogram opposite the origin
as illustrated with the vectors w D 3 C 4i and z D 8 C 3i in Figure 5.2.

Summary of Section 5.1
In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:
 A complex number is an object of the form a C bi , where a and b are
real numbers and i 2 D 1. When we have a complex number of the form
z D a C bi , the number a is called the real part of the complex number z
and the number b is called the imaginary part of z.
 We can add, subtract, multiply, and divide complex numbers as follows:

 A complex number a C bi can be represented geometrically with a vector in
standard position with terminal point .a; b/. When we do this, the horizontal
axis is called the real axis, and the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis.
In addition, the coordinate plane is then referred to as the complex plane.
That is, if z D a C bi we can think of z as a directed line segment from the

from the imaginary axis and b units from the real axis.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What is the polar (trigonometric) form of a complex number?
 How do we multiply two complex numbers in polar form?
 How do we divide one complex number in polar form by a nonzero
complex number in polar form?
Multiplication of complex numbers is more complicated than addition of complex numbers. To better understand the product of complex numbers, we first investigate the trigonometric (or polar) form of a complex number. This trigonometric
form connects algebra to trigonometry and will be useful for quickly and easily
finding powers and roots of complex numbers.

Beginning Activity
If z D a C bi is a complex number, then we can plot z in the plane as shown
in Figure 5.3. In this situation, we will let r be the magnitude of z (that is, the
distance from z to the origin) and  the angle z makes with the positive real axis
as shown in Figure 5.3.

There is an alternate representation that you will often see for the polar form of

only consider this as notation. When we write e i (where i is the complex number

The result of Example 5.7 is no coincidence, as we will show. In general, we
have the following important result about the product of two complex numbers.
Muliplication of Complex Numbers in Polar Form
Let w D r.cos.Àõ/ C i sin.Àõ// and z D s.cos.Àá/ C i sin.Àá// be complex
numbers in polar form. Then the polar form of the complex product wz is
given by
wz D rs .cos.Àõ C Àá/ C i sin.Àõ C Àá// :
This states that to multiply two complex numbers in polar form, we multiply
their norms and add their arguments.
To understand why this result it true in general, let w D r.cos.Àõ/ C i sin.Àõ//
and z D s.cos.Àá/ C i sin.Àá// be complex numbers in polar form. We will use
cosine and sine of sums of angles identities to find wz:

Quotients of Complex Numbers in Polar Form
We have seen that we multiply complex numbers in polar form by multiplying
their norms and adding their arguments. There is a similar method to divide one
complex number in polar form by another complex number in polar form.
Division of Complex Numbers in Polar Form
Let w D r.cos.Àõ/ C i sin.Àõ// and z D s.cos.Àá/ C i sin.Àá// be complex

So to divide complex numbers in polar form, we divide the norm of the
complex number in the numerator by the norm of the complex number in
the denominator and subtract the argument of the complex number in the
denominator from the argument of the complex number in the numerator.
The proof of this is similar to the proof for multiplying complex numbers and

In this section, we studied the following important concepts and ideas:
 If z D a C bi is a complex number, then we can plot z in the plane. If r is
the magnitude of z (that is, the distance from z to the origin) and  the angle
z makes with the positive real axis, then the trigonomtric form (or polar
form) of z is z D r.cos. / C i sin.t het a/, where
p
a
b
r D a2 D b 2 ; cos. / D ; and sin. / D :

r
The angle  is called the argument of the complex number z and the real
number r is the modulus or norm of z.

 If w D r.cos.Àõ/ C i sin.Àõ// and z D s.cos.Àá/ C i sin.Àá// are complex

This states that to multiply two complex numbers in polar form, we multiply
their norms and add their arguments, and to divide two complex numbers,
we divide their norms and subtract their arguments.

Focus Questions
The following questions are meant to guide our study of the material in this
section. After studying this section, we should understand the concepts motivated by these questions and be able to write precise, coherent answers to
these questions.
 What is de Moivre‚Äôs Theorem and why is it useful?
 If n is a positive integer, what is an nth root of a complex number? How
many nth roots does a complex number have? How do we find all of the
nth roots of a complex number?
The trigonometric form of a complex number provides a relatively quick and
easy way to compute products of complex numbers. As a consequence, we will be
able to quickly calculate powers of complex numbers, and even roots of complex
numbers.

De Moivre‚Äôs Theorem
The result of Equation (1) is not restricted to only squares of a complex number. If

D r 4 .cos.4 / C i sin.4 // :

5.3. DeMoivre‚Äôs Theorem and Powers of Complex Numbers

315

The equations for z 2 , z 3 , and z 4 establish a pattern that is true in general. The
result is called de Moivre‚Äôs Theorem.
DeMoivre‚Äôs Theorem
Let z D r.cos. / C i sin. // be a complex number and n any integer. Then
z n D r n .cos.n / C i sin.n //:
It turns out that DeMoivre‚Äôs Theorem also works for negative integer powers
as well.
Progress Check 5.10 (DeMoivre‚Äôs Theorem)
Write the complex number 1 i in polar form. Then use DeMoivre‚Äôs Theorem to
write .1 i /10 in the complex form a C bi , where a and b are real numbers and
do not involve the use of a trigonometric function.

Roots of Complex Numbers
DeMoivre‚Äôs Theorem is very useful in calculating powers of complex numbers,
even fractional powers. We illustrate with an example.
Example 5.11 (Roots of Complex Numbers)
We will find all of the solutions to the equation x 3 1 D 0. These solutions are
also called the roots of the polynomial x 3 1. To solve the equation x 3 1 D 0,
we add 1 to both sides to rewrite the equation in the form x 3 D 1. Recall that to
solve a polynomial equation like x 3 D 1 means to find all of the numbers (real or
complex) that satisfy the equation. We can take the real cube root of both sides
of this equation to obtain the solution x0 D 1, but every cubic polynomial should
have three solutions. How can we find the other two? If we draw the graph of
y D x 3 1 we see that the graph intersects the x-axis at only one point, so there
is only one real solution to x 3 D 1. That means the other two solutions must be
complex and we can use DeMoivre‚Äôs Theorem to find them. To do this, suppose
z D r ≈ícos. / C i sin. /¬ç
is a solution to x 3 D 1. Then
1 D z 3 D r 3 .cos.3 / C i sin.3 //:
This implies that r D 1 (or r D 1, but we can incorporate the latter case into our
choice of angle). We then reduce the equation x 3 D 1 to the equation
1 D cos.3 / C i sin.3 /:

(2)

316

Chapter 5. Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates

Equation (2) has solutions when cos.3 / D 1 and sin.3 / D 0. This will occur
2k

We already know that x03 D 13 D 1, so x0 actually is a solution to x 3 D 1. To

Thus, x13 D 1 and x23 D 1 and we have found three solutions to the equation
x 3 D 1. Since a cubic can have only three solutions, we have found them all.

is a positive integer and a C bi is a complex number works the same way. Write
a C bi in trigonometric form

a C bi . We summarize the results.

As another example, we find the complex square roots of 1. In other words, we find
the solutions to the equation z 2 D 1. Of course, we already know that the square
roots of 1 are 1 and 1, but it will be instructive to utilize our general result and
see that it gives the same result. Note that the trigonometric form of 1 is

Introduction
In our study of trigonometry so far, whenever we graphed an equation or located a
point in the plane, we have used rectangular (or Cartesian 3 ) coordinates. The use
of this type of coordinate system revolutionized mathematics since it provided the
first systematic link between geometry and algebra. Even though the rectangular
coordinate system is very important, there are other methods of locating points in
the plane. We will study one such system in this section.
Rectangular coordinates use two numbers (in the form of an ordered pair) to
determine the loction of a point in the plane. These numbers give the position of a

3 units to the right and then travel 1 unit up. The idea of the polar coordinate
system is to give a distance to travel and an angle in which direction to
ptravel.

We reach the same point as the one given by the rectangular coordinates
3; 1
by saying we will travel 2 units at an angle of 30ƒ± from the x-axis. These values
correspond to the values of r and  in the diagram for the beginning activity. Using

the Pythagorean Theorem, we can obtain r D 2 and using the fact that sin. / D ,

The Polar Coordinate System
For the rectangular coordinate system, we use two numbers, in the form of an
ordered pair, to locate a point in the plane. We do the same thing for polar coordinates, but now the first number represents a distance from a point and the second
number represents an angle. In the polar coordinate system, we start with a point
O, called the pole and from this point, we draw a horizontal ray (directed half-line)
called the polar axis. We can then assign polar coordinates .r;  / to a point P in
the plane as follows (see Figure 5.5):
 The number r, called the radial distance, is the directed distance from the
pole to the point P .
 The number  , called the polar angle, is the measure of the angle from the
polar axis to the line segment OP . (Either radians or degrees can be used for
the measure of the angle.)

Conventions for Polar Coordinates
 The polar angle  is considered positive if measured in a counterclockwise
direction from the polar axis.
 The polar angle  is considered negative if measured in a clockwise direction
from the polar axis.
 If the radial distance r is positive, then the point P is r units from O along
the terminal side of  .

difference between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates. Whereas each

many different representations in polar coordinates. This is primarily due to the
fact that the polar coordinate system uses concentric cirlces for its grid, and we can
start at a point on a circle and travel around the circle and end at the point from
which we started. Since one wrap around a circle corresponds to an angle of 2
radians or 360ƒ± , we have the following:

Conversions Between Polar and Rectangular Coordinates
We now have two ways to locate points in the plane. One is the usual rectangular
(Cartesian) coordinate system and the other is the polar coordinate system. The
rectangular coordinate system uses two distances to locate a point, whereas the
polar coordinate system uses a distance and an angle to locate a point. Although
these two systems can be studied indpendently of each other, we can set them up
so that there is a relationship between the two types of coordinates. We do this as
follows:
 We place the pole of the polar coordinate system at the origin of the rectangular coordinate system.
 We have the polar axis of the polar coordinate system coincide with the positive x-axis of the rectangular coordinate system as shown in Figure 5.8

When determining the polar coordinates of a point, we usually choose the positive value for r. We can use an inverse trigonometric function to help determine
 but we must be careful to place  in the proper quadrant by using the signs of x

When we convert from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we must

for the angle  and then use the signs of x and y to determine  .

The Graph of a Polar Equation
The graph an equation on the rectangular coordinate system consists of all points
.x; y/ that satisfy the equation. The equation can often be written in the form of
a function such as y D f .x/. In this case, a point .a; b/ is on the graph of this
function if and only if b D f .a/. In a similar manner,
An equation whose variables are polar coordinates (usually r and  ) is called
a polar equation. The graph of a polar equation is the set of all points
whose polar coordinates .r;  / satisfy the given equation.

An example of a polar equation is r D 4 sin. /. For this equation, notice that
 If  D 0, then r D 4 sin.0/ D 0 and so the point .0; 0/ (in polar coordinates)
is on the graph of this equation.

of this equation. (Remember: for polar coordinates, the value of r is the first
coordinate.)
The most basic method for drawing the graph of a polar equation is to plot the
points that satisfy the polar equation on polar graph paper as shown in Figure 5.7
and then connect the points with a smooth curve.
Progress Check 5.21 (Graphing a Polar Equation)

Plot these points on polar graph paper and draw a smooth curve through the points

Depending on how carefully we plot the points and how well we draw the
curve, the graph in Progress Check 5.21 could be a circle. We can, of course,
plot more points. In fact, in Progress Check 5.21, we only used values for  with
0    . The following table shows the values of r and  for points that are on
the graph of the polar equation r D 4 sin. / with     2.

Because of the negative values for r, if we plot these points, we will get the same
points we did in Progress Check 5.21. So a good question to ask is, ‚ÄúDo these
points really lie on a circle?‚Äù We can answer this question by converting the equation r D 4 sin. / into an equivalent equation with rectangular coordinates.
r D 4 sin. /

Transforming an Equation from Polar Form to Rectangular Form
The formulas that we used to convert a point in polar coordinates to rectangular
coordinates can also be used to convert an equation in polar form to rectangular
form. These equations are given in the box on page 326. So let us look at the
equation r D 4 sin. / from Progress Check 5.21.
Progress Check 5.22 (Transforming a Polar Equation into Rectangular Form)
We start with the equation r D 4 sin. /. We want to transform this into an equation
involving x and y. Since r 2 D x 2 C y 2 , it might be easier to work with r 2 rather
than r.
1. Multiply both sides of the equation r D 4 sin. / by r.
2. Now use the equations r 2 D x 2 C y 2 and y D r sin. / to obtain an equivalent equation in x and y.
The graph of the equation the graph of r D 4 sin. / in polar coordinates will
be the same as the graph of x 2 C y 2 D 4y in rectangular coordinates. We can now
use some algebra from previous mathematics courses to show that this is the graph
of a circle. The idea is to collect all terms on the left side of the equation and use
completing the square for the terms involving y.
As a reminder, if we have the expression t 2 C at D 0, we complete the square
 a 2
by adding
to both sides of the equation. We will then have a perfect square

This is the equation (in rectangular coordinates) of a circle with radius 2 and center
at the point .0; 2/. We see that this is consistent with the graph we obtained in
Progress Check 5.22.
Progress Check 5.23 (Transforming a Polar Equation into Rectangular Form)
Transform the equation r D 6 cos. / into an equation in rectangular coordinates
and then explain why the graph of r D 6 cos. / is a circle. What is the radius of
this circle and what is its center?

The Polar Grid
We introduced polar graph paper in Figure 5.7. Notice that this consists of concentric circles centered at the pole and lines that pass through the pole. These circles
and lines have very simple equations in polar coordinates. For example:
 Consider the equation r D 3. In order for a point to be on the graph of this
equation, it must lie on a circle of radius 3 whose center is the pole. So the
graph of this equation is a circle of radius 3 whose center is the pole. We
can also show this by converting the equation r D 3 to rectangular form as
follows:
rD3

r 2 D 32

x2 C y2 D 9

In rectangular coordinates, this is the equation of a circle of radius 3 centered
at the origin.

332

Chapter 5. Complex Numbers and Polar Coordinates


 Now consider the equation  D . In order for a point to be on the graph
4
of this equation, the line through the pole and this point must make an angle

of
radians with the polar axis. If we only allow positive values for r,
4
the graph will be a ray with initial point at the pole that makes an angle of

with the polar axis. However, if we allow r to be any real number, then
4

we obtain the line through the pole that makes an angle of
radians with

the polar axis. We can convert this equation to rectangular coordinates as
follows:

This is an equation for a straight line through the origin with a slope of 1.
In general:
The Polar Grid
 If a is a positive real number, then the graph of r D a is a circle of
radius a whose center is the pole.
 If b is a real number, then the graph of  D b is a line through the pole
that makes an angle of b radians with the polar axis.

Concluding Remarks
We have studied just a few graphs of polar equations. There are many interesting
graphs that can be generated using polar equations that are very difficult to accomplish in rectangular coordinates. Since the polar coordinate system is based on
concentric circles, it should not be surprising that circles with center at the pole
would have ‚Äúsimple‚Äù equations like r D a.
In Progress Checks 5.21 and 5.23, we saw polar equations whose graphs were
circles with centers not at the pole. These were special cases of the following:

1. Since we can wrap any number onto the unit circle, we can always find the
terminal point of an arc that corresponds to any number. So the cosine of

We must now decide whether to use a sine function or a cosine function to
get the phase shift. Since we have the coordinates of a high point, we will
use a cosine function. For this, the phase shift will be 172. So our function
is
 

y D 3:165 cos
.t 172/ C 12:185:
183
We can check this by verifying that when t D 155, y D 15:135 and that
when t D 355, y D 9:02.
(a) March 10 is day number 69. So we use t D 69 and get

y D 3:165 cos

So on March 10, 2014, there were about 11.564 hours of daylight.
(172, 15.135)

Some Geometric Facts about
Triangles and Parallelograms
This appendix contains some formulas and results from geometry that are important in the study of trigonometry.

Circles
For a circle with radius r:

r

 Circumference: C D 2 r
 Area: A D  r 2

Triangles
 The sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180ƒ± .
 A triangle in which each angle has a measure of less that 90ƒ± is called an
acute triangle.
 A triangle that has an angle whose measure is greater than 90ƒ± is called an
obtuse triangle.
 A triangle that contains an angle whose measure is 90ƒ± is called a right
triangle. The side of a right triangle that is opposite the right angle is called

the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the legs.

 An isosceles triangle is a triangle in which two sides of the triangle have
equal length. In this case, the two angles across from the two sides of equal
length have equal measure.
 An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same
length. Each angle of an equilateral triangle has a measure of 60ƒ± .

Right Triangles
 The sum of the measures of the two acute angles of
a right triangle is 90ƒ± . In the diagram on the right,
Àõ C Àá D 90ƒ± .

 The Pythagorean Theorem. In a right triangle, the
square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the
squares of the other two sides. In the diagram on the
right, c 2 D a2 C b 2 .

Special Right Triangles
 A right triangle in which both acute angles are 45ƒ± . For this type of right
triangle, the lengths of the two legs are equal. So if c is the length of the
hypotenuse and x is the length of each of the legs, then by the Pythagorean
Theorem, c 2 D x 2 C x 2 . Solving this equation for x, we obtain
