The Team with the RAZR’s Edge
The publicly traded company Motorola
Mobility was created when Motorola spun off its

Figure P.1: The Droid RAZR

Mobile Devices division, creating a new entity. The
newly-formed company’s executive team was under
intense pressure to come out with a smartphone
that could grab substantial market share from
Apple’s iPhone 4S and Samsung’s Galaxy Nexus.
To do this, the team oversaw the design of an
Android version of the Motorola RAZR, which was
once the best-selling phone in the world. The hope
of the executive team was that past customers who
loved the RAZR would love the new ultra-thin
smartphone—the Droid RAZR. The Droid RAZR
was designed by a team, as are other Motorola
products. To understand the team approach at
Motorola, let’s review the process used to design the RAZR.
By winter 2003, the company that for years had run ringtones around the competition
had been bumped from the top spot in worldwide sales.1 Motorola found itself stuck in the
number-three slot. Their sales had declined because consumers were less than enthusiastic
about the uninspired style of Motorola phones, and for many people, style is just as important
in picking a cell phone as features. As a reviewer for one industry publication put it, “We just
want to see the look on people’s faces when we slide [our phones] out of our pockets to take a
call.”
Yet there was a glimmer of hope at Motorola. Despite its recent lapse in cell phone
fashion sense, Motorola still maintained a concept-phone unit—a group responsible for
designing futuristic new product features such as speech-recognition capability, flexible
touchscreens, and touch-sensitive body covers. In every concept-phone unit, developers

Preface

engage in an ongoing struggle to balance the two often-opposing demands of cell phone
design: building the smallest possible phone with the largest possible screen. The previous
year, Motorola had unveiled the rough model of an ultra-trim phone—at 10 millimeters, about
half the width of the average flip-top or “clamshell” design. It was on this concept that Motorola
decided to stake the revival of its reputation as a cell phone maker who knew how to package
functionality with a wow factor.
The next step in developing a concept phone is actually building it. Teamwork becomes
critical at this point. The process requires some diversity in expertise. An electronics engineer,
for example, knows how to apply energy to transmit information through a system but not how
to apply physics to the design and manufacture of the system; that’s the specialty of a
mechanical engineer. Engineers aren’t designers—the specialists who know how to enhance
the marketability of a product through its aesthetic value. Designers bring their own unique
value to the team.
In addition, when you set out to build any kind of innovative high-tech product, you need
to become a master of trade-offs—in Motorola’s case, compromises resulted from the
demands of state-of-the-art functionality on one hand and fashionable design on the other.
Negotiating trade-offs is a team process: it takes at least two people to resolve design
disputes.
The responsibility for assembling and managing the Motorola “thin-clam” team fell to
veteran electronic engineer Roger Jellicoe. His mission: create the world’s thinnest phone, do
it in one year, and try to keep it a secret. Before the project was completed, the team had
grown to more than twenty members, and with increased creative input and enthusiasm came
increased confidence and clout. Jellicoe had been warned by company specialists in such
matters that no phone wider than 49 millimeters could be held comfortably in the human hand.
When the team had finally arrived at a satisfactory design that couldn’t work at less than 53
millimeters, they ignored the “49 millimeters warning,” built a model, passed it around, and
came to a consensus: as one team member put it, “People could hold it in their hands and say,
‘Yeah, it doesn’t feel like a brick.’” Four millimeters, they decided, was an acceptable trade-off,
and the new phone went to market at 53 millimeters. While small by today’s standards, at the
time, 53 millimeters was a gamble.

Team members liked to call the design process the “dance.” Sometimes it flowed
smoothly and sometimes people stepped on one another’s toes, but for the most part, the
team moved in lockstep toward its goal. After a series of trade-offs about what to call the final
product (suggestions ranged from Razor Clam to V3), Motorola’s new RAZR was introduced in
July 2004. Recall that the product was originally conceived as a high-tech toy—something to
restore the luster to Motorola’s tarnished image. It wasn’t supposed to set sales records, and
sales in the fourth quarter of 2004, though
promising, were in fact fairly modest. Back in
September, however, a new executive named

Figure P.2: The original best-selling
Motorola RAZR

Ron Garriques had taken over Motorola’s cell
phone division; one of his first decisions was to
raise the bar for RAZR. Disregarding a 2005
budget that called for sales of two million units,
Garriques pushed expected sales for the RAZR
up to twenty million. The RAZR topped that target,
shipped ten million in the first quarter of 2006, and
hit the fifty-million mark at midyear. Talking on a
RAZR, declared hip-hop star Sean “P. Diddy”
Combs, “is like driving a Mercedes versus a
regular ol’ ride.”2
Jellicoe and his team were invited to attend an event hosted by top executives,
receiving a standing ovation, along with a load of stock options. One of the reasons for the
RAZR’s success, said Jellicoe, was that “It took the world by surprise. Very few Motorola
products do that.” For a while, the new RAZR was the best-selling phone in the world.

The Team and the Organization
What Is a Team? How Does Teamwork Work?
A team (or a work team) is a group of people with complementary skills who work
together to achieve a specific goal.3 In the case of Motorola’s RAZR team, the specific goal
was to develop (and ultimately bring to market) an ultrathin cell phone that would help restore

Preface

the company’s reputation. The team achieved its goal by integrating specialized but
complementary skills in engineering and design and by making the most of its authority to
make its own decisions and manage its own operations.

Teams versus Groups
As Bonnie Edelstein, a consultant in organizational development suggests, “A group is a
bunch of people in an elevator. A team is also a bunch of people in an elevator, but the
elevator is broken.”4 This distinction may be a little oversimplified, but as our tale of teamwork
at Motorola reminds us, a team is clearly something more than a mere group of individuals. In
particular, members of a group—or, more accurately, a working group—go about their jobs
independently and meet primarily to work towards a shared objective. A group of departmentstore managers, for example, might meet monthly to discuss their progress in cutting plant
costs. However, each manager is focused on the goals of his or her department because each
is held accountable for meeting those goals.

Some Key Characteristics of Teams
To put teams in perspective, let’s identify five key characteristics. Teams:5
1) Share accountability for achieving specific common goals
2) Function interdependently
3) Require stability
4) Hold authority and decision-making power
5) Operate in a social context

Why Organizations Build Teams
Why do major organizations now rely so much on teams to improve operations?
Executives at Xerox have reported that team-based operations are 30 percent more productive
than conventional operations. General Mills says that factories organized around team
activities are 40 percent more productive than traditionally organized factories. FedEx says
that teams reduced service errors (lost packages, incorrect bills) by 13 percent in the first
year.6

Today it seems obvious that teams can address a variety of challenges in the world of
corporate activity. Before we go any further, however, we should remind ourselves that the
data we’ve just cited aren’t necessarily definitive. For one thing, they may not be objective—
companies are more likely to report successes than failures. As a matter of fact, teams don’t
always work. According to one study, team-based projects fail 50 to 70 percent of the time.7

The Effect of Teams on Performance
Research shows that companies build and support teams because of their effect on
overall workplace performance, both organizational and individual. If we examine the impact of
team-based operations according to a wide range of relevant criteria, we find that overall
organizational performance generally improves. Figure P.3 lists several areas in which we can
analyze workplace performance and indicates the percentage of companies that have reported
improvements in each area.

Types of Teams
Teams, then, can improve company and individual performance in a number of areas.
Not all teams, however, are formed to achieve the same goals or charged with the same
responsibilities. Nor are they organized in the same way. Some, for instance, are more
autonomous than others—less accountable to those higher up in the organization. Some
depend on a team leader who’s responsible for defining the team’s goals and making sure that
its activities are performed effectively. Others are more or less self- governing: though a leader
lays out overall goals and strategies, the team itself chooses and manages the methods by
which it pursues its goals and implements its strategies.8 Teams also vary according to their
membership. Let’s look at several categories of teams.

Manager-Led Teams
As its name implies, in the manager-led team the
manager is the team leader and is in charge of setting team
goals, assigning tasks, and monitoring the team’s

performance. The individual team members have relatively
little autonomy. For example, the key employees of a
professional football team (a manager-led team) are highly
trained (and highly paid) athletes, but their activities on the
field are tightly controlled by a head coach. As team manager,
the coach is responsible both for developing the strategies by
which the team pursues its goal of winning games and for the
outcome of each game and season. He’s also solely
responsible for interacting with managers above him in the
organization. The players are responsible mainly for executing
plays.9

Self-Managing Teams
Self-managing teams (also known as self-directed teams) have considerable
autonomy. They are usually small and often absorb activities that were once performed by
traditional supervisors. A manager or team leader may determine overall goals, but the
members of the self-managing team control the activities needed to achieve those goals.

Self-managing teams are the organizational hallmark of Whole Foods Market, the
largest natural-foods grocer in the United States. Each store is run by ten departmental teams,
and virtually every store employee is a member of a team. Each team has a designated leader
and its own performance targets. (Team leaders also belong to a store team, and store-team
leaders belong to a regional team.) To do its job, every team has access to the kind of
information—including sales and even salary figures—that most companies reserve for
traditional managers.10
Not every self-managed team enjoys the same degree of autonomy. Companies vary
widely in choosing which tasks teams are allowed to manage and which ones are best left to
upper-level management only. As you can see in Figure P.5 for example, self-managing teams
are often allowed to schedule assignments, but they are rarely allowed to fire coworkers.

Cross-Functional Teams
Many companies use cross-functional teams—teams that, as the name suggests, cut
across an organization’s functional areas (operations, marketing, finance, and so on). A crossfunctional team is designed to take advantage of the special expertise of members drawn from
different functional areas of the company. When the Internal Revenue Service, for example,
wanted to study the effects on employees of a major change in information systems, it created
a cross-functional team composed of people from a wide range of departments. The final study
reflected expertise in such areas as job analysis, training, change management, industrial
psychology, and ergonomics.11
Cross-functional teams figure prominently in the product-development process at Nike,
where they take advantage of expertise from both inside and outside the company.
Typically, team members include not only product designers, marketing specialists, and
accountants but also sports-research experts, coaches, athletes, and even consumers.
Likewise, Motorola’s RAZR team was a cross-functional team; responsibility for developing the
new product wasn’t passed along from the design team to the engineering team but rather was
entrusted to a special team composed of both designers and engineers.
Committees and task forces, both of which are dedicated to specific issues or tasks, are
often cross-functional teams. Problem-solving teams, which are created to study such issues
as improving quality or reducing waste, may be either intradepartmental or cross- functional.12

Virtual Teams
Technology now makes it possible for teams to function not only across organizational
boundaries like functional areas but also across time and space. Technologies such as
videoconferencing allow people to interact simultaneously and in real time, offering a number
of advantages in conducting the business of a virtual team.13 Members can participate from
any location or at any time of day, and teams can “meet” for as long as it takes to achieve a
goal or solve a problem—a few days, weeks, or months.
Team size does not seem to be an obstacle when it comes to virtual-team meetings; in
building the F-35 Strike Fighter, U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin staked the $225
billion project on a virtual product-team of unprecedented global dimension, drawing on

Why Teamwork Works
Now that we know a little bit about how teams work, we need to ask ourselves why they
work. Not surprisingly, this is a fairly complex issue. In this section, we’ll explore why teams
are often effective and when they ineffective.

Factors in Effective Teamwork
First, let’s begin by identifying several factors that contribute to effective teamwork.
Teams are most effective when the following factors are met:



Members depend on each other. When team members rely on each other to get
the job done, team productivity and efficiency tend to be high.



Members trust one another.



Members work better together than individually. When team members perform
better as a group than alone, collective performance exceeds individual
performance.



Members become boosters. When each member is encouraged by other team
members to do his or her best, collective results improve.



Team members enjoy being on the team.



Leadership rotates.

Some of these factors may seem intuitive. Because such issues are rarely clear-cut, we
need to examine the issue of group effectiveness from another perspective—one that
considers the effects of factors that aren’t quite so straightforward.

Group Cohesiveness
The idea of group cohesiveness refers to the attractiveness of a team to its members.
If a group is high in cohesiveness, membership is quite satisfying to its members. If it’s low in
cohesiveness, members are unhappy with it and may try to leave it.15

What Makes a Team Cohesive?
Numerous factors may contribute to team cohesiveness, but in this section, we’ll focus
on five of the most important:
1) Size. The bigger the team, the less satisfied members tend to be. When teams
get too large, members find it harder to interact closely with other members; a
few members tend to dominate team activities, and conflict becomes more likely.
2) Similarity. People usually get along better with people like themselves, and
teams are generally more cohesive when members perceive fellow members as
people who share their own attitudes and experience.
3) Success. When teams are successful, members are satisfied, and other people
are more likely to be attracted to their teams.
4) Exclusiveness. The harder it is to get into a group, the happier the people who
are already in it. Team status also increases members’ satisfaction.
5) Competition. Membership is valued more highly when there is motivation to
achieve common goals and outperform other teams.
Maintaining team focus on broad organizational goals is crucial. If members get too
wrapped up in immediate team goals, the whole team may lose sight of the larger
organizational goals toward which it’s supposed to be working. Let’s look at some factors that
can erode team performance.

Groupthink
It’s easy for leaders to direct members toward team goals when members are all on the
same page—when there’s a basic willingness to conform to the team’s rules. When there’s too
much conformity, however, the group can become ineffective: it may resist fresh ideas and,
what’s worse, may end up adopting its own dysfunctional tendencies as its way of doing
things. Such tendencies may also encourage a phenomenon known as groupthink—the
tendency to conform to group pressure in making decisions, while failing to think critically or to
consider outside influences.

Groupthink is often cited as a factor in the explosion
of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986: engineers

warned that the launch might be risky because of the
weather but were persuaded to set aside their warning by
NASA officials who wanted the launch to proceed as
scheduled.16

Motivation and Frustration
Remember that teams are composed of people, and
whatever the roles they happen to be playing at a given
time, people are subject to psychological ups and downs.
As members of workplace teams, they need motivation,
and when motivation is low, so are effectiveness and
productivity. The difficulty of maintaining a high level of
motivation is the chief cause of frustration among members of teams. As such, it’s also a chief
cause of ineffective teamwork, and that’s one reason why more employers now look for the
ability to develop and sustain motivation when they’re hiring new managers.17

Other Factors that Erode Performance
Let’s take a quick look at three other obstacles to success in introducing teams into an
organization:18

 Unwillingness to cooperate. Failure to cooperate can occur when members
don’t or won’t commit to a common goal or set of activities. What if, for example,
half the members of a product-development team want to create a brand-new
product and half want to improve an existing product? The entire team may get
stuck on this point of contention for weeks or even months. Lack of cooperation
between teams can also be problematic to an organization.

 Lack of managerial support. Every team requires organizational resources to
achieve its goals, and if management isn’t willing to commit the needed
resources— say, funding or key personnel—a team will probably fall short of
those goals.

Preface

 Failure of managers to delegate authority. Team leaders are often chosen
from the ranks of successful supervisors—first-line managers give instructions on
a day-to-day basis and expect to have them carried out. This approach to
workplace activities may not work very well in leading a team—a position in
which success depends on building a consensus and letting people make their
own decisions.

The Team and Its Members
“Life Is All about Group Work”
“I’ll work extra hard and do it myself, but please don’t make me have to work in a
group.”
Like it or not, you’ve probably already notice that you’ll have team-based assignments in
college. More than two-thirds of all students report having participated in the work of an
organized team, and if you’re in business school, you will almost certainly find yourself
engaged in team-based activities.19
Why do we put so much emphasis on something that, reportedly, makes many students
feel anxious and academically drained? Here’s one college student’s practical-minded answer
to this question:
“In the real world, you have to work with people. You don’t always know the people you
work with, and you don’t always get along with them. Your boss won’t particularly care, and if
you can’t get the job done, your job may end up on the line. Life is all about group work,
whether we like it or not. And school, in many ways, prepares us for life, including working with
others.”20
She’s right. In placing so much emphasis on teamwork skills and experience, business
colleges are doing the responsible thing—preparing students for the business world. A survey
of Fortune 1000 companies reveals that 79 percent use self-managing teams and 91 percent
use other forms of employee work groups. Another survey found that the skill that most

Preface

employers value in new employees is the ability to work in teams.21 Consider the advice of
former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca: “A major reason that capable people fail to advance is
that they don’t work well with their colleagues.”22 The importance of the ability to work in teams
was confirmed in a survey of leadership practices of more than sixty of the world’s top
organizations.23
When top executives in these organizations were asked what causes the careers of
high-potential leadership candidates to derail, 60 percent of the organizations cited “inability to
work in teams.” Interestingly, only 9 percent attributed the failure of these executives to
advance to “lack of technical ability.”
To put it in plain terms, the question is not whether you’ll find yourself working as part of
a team. You will. The question is whether you’ll know how to participate successfully in teambased activities.

Will You Make a Good Team Member?
What if your instructor decides to divide the class into teams and assigns each team to
develop a new product plus a business plan to get it on the market? What teamwork skills
could you bring to the table, and what teamwork skills do you need to improve? Do you
possess qualities that might make you a good team leader?

What Skills Does the Team Need?
Sometimes we hear about a sports team made up of mostly average players who win a
championship because of coaching genius, flawless teamwork, and superhuman
determination.24 But not terribly often. In fact, we usually hear about such teams simply
because they’re newsworthy—exceptions to the rule. Typically a team performs well because
its members possess some level of talent. Members’ talents must also be managed in a
collective effort to achieve a common goal.
In the final analysis, a team can succeed only if its members provide the skills that need
managing. In particular, every team requires some mixture of three sets of skills:

 Technical skills. Because teams must perform certain tasks, they need people
with the skills to perform them. For example, if your project calls for a lot of math
14

Preface

work, it’s good to have someone with the necessary quantitative skills.

 Decision-making and problem-solving skills. Because every task is subject to
problems, and because handling every problem means deciding on the best
solution, it’s good to have members who are skilled in identifying problems,
evaluating alternative solutions, and deciding on the best options.

 Interpersonal skills. Because teams need direction and motivation and depend
on communication, every group benefits from members who know how to listen,
provide feedback, and resolve conflict. Some members must also be good at
communicating the team’s goals and needs to outsiders.
The key is ultimately to have the right mix of these skills. Remember, too, that no team
needs to possess all these skills—never mind the right balance of them—from day one. In
many cases, a team gains certain skills only when members volunteer for certain tasks and
perfect their skills in the process of performing them. For the same reason, effective teamwork
develops over time as team members learn how to handle various team-based tasks. In a
sense, teamwork is always work in progress.

What Roles Do Team Members Play?
As a student and later in the workplace, you’ll be a member of a team more often than a
leader. Team members can have as much impact on a team’s success as its leaders. A key is
the quality of the contributions they make in performing non-leadership roles.25
What, exactly, are those roles? At this point, you’ve probably concluded that every team
faces two basic challenges:
1) Accomplishing its assigned task
2) Maintaining or improving group cohesiveness
Whether you affect the team’s work positively or negatively depends on the extent to
which you help it or hinder it in meeting these two challenges.26 We can thus divide teamwork
roles into two categories, depending on which of these two challenges each role addresses.
These two categories (task-facilitating roles and relationship-building roles) are summarized
here:

someone else needs it but also asking for it when you need it. In addition, it includes

Preface

monitoring (checking on progress) and enforcing (making sure that team decisions are carried
out). Task facilitators are especially valuable when assignments aren’t clear or when progress
is too slow.
Relationship-Building Roles
When you challenge unmotivated behavior or help other team members understand
their roles, you’re performing a relationship-building role and addressing challenge number
two—maintaining or improving group cohesiveness. This type of role includes activities that
improve team “chemistry,” from empathizing to confronting.
Bear in mind three points about this model: (1) Teams are most effective when there’s a
good balance between task facilitation and relationship-building; (2) it’s hard for any given
member to perform both types of roles, as some people are better at focusing on tasks and
others on relationships; and (3) overplaying any facet of any role can easily become
counterproductive. For example, elaborating on something may not be the best strategy when
the team needs to make a quick decision; and consensus building may cause the team to
overlook an important difference of opinion.
Blocking Roles
Finally, review Figure P.7, which summarizes a few characteristics of another kind of
team-membership role. So-called blocking roles consist of behavior that inhibits either team
performance or that of individual members. Every member of the team should know how to
recognize blocking behavior. If teams don’t confront dysfunctional members, they can destroy
morale, hamper consensus building, create conflict, and hinder progress.

Class Team Projects
In your academic career you’ll participate in a number of team projects. To get insider
advice on how to succeed on team projects in college, let’s look at some suggestions offered
by students who have gone through this experience.27

 Draw up a team charter. At the beginning of the project, draw up a team charter
that includes: the goals of the group; ways to ensure that each team member’s ideas
are considered; timing and frequency of meeting. A more informal way to arrive at a
team charter is to simply set some ground rules to which everyone agrees.

Preface

 Contribute your ideas. Share your ideas with your group. The worst that could
happen is that they won’t be used (which is what would happen if you kept quiet).

 Never miss a meeting or deadline. Pick a weekly meeting time and write it into
your schedule as if it were a class. Never skip it.

 Be considerate of each other. Be patient, listen to everyone, involve everyone in
decision making, avoid infighting, build trust.

 Create a process for resolving conflict. Do so before conflict arises. Set up rules
to help the group decide how conflict will be handled.

 Use the strengths of each team member. All students bring different strengths.
Utilize the unique value of each person.

 Don’t do all the work yourself. Work with your team to get the work done. The
project output is often less important than the experience.

What Does It Take to Lead a Team?
To borrow from Shakespeare, “Some people are born leaders, some achieve
leadership, and some have leadership thrust upon them.” At some point in a successful career,
you will likely be asked to lead a team. What will you have to do to succeed as a leader?
Like so many of the questions that we ask in this book, this question doesn’t have any
simple answers. We can provide one broad answer: a leader must help members develop the
attitudes and behavior that contribute to team success: interdependence, collective
responsibility, shared commitment, and so forth.
Team leaders must be able to influence their team members. Notice that we say
influence: except in unusual circumstances, giving commands and controlling everything
directly doesn’t work very well.28 As one team of researchers puts it, team leaders are more
effective when they work with members rather than on them.29 Hand-in-hand with the ability to
influence is the ability to gain and keep the trust of team members. People aren’t likely to be
influenced by a leader whom they perceive as dishonest or selfishly motivated.
Assuming you were asked to lead a team, there are certain leadership skills and
behaviors that would help you influence your team members and build trust. Let’s look briefly
at some of them:

 Demonstrate integrity. Do what you say you’ll do and act in accordance with your
stated values. Be honest in communicating and follow through on promises.

 Be clear and consistent. Let members know that you’re certain about what you
want and remember that being clear and consistent reinforces your credibility.

 Generate positive energy. Be optimistic and compliment team members.
Recognize their progress and success.

 Acknowledge common points of view. Even if you’re about to propose some kind
of change, recognize the value of the views that members already hold in common.

 Manage agreement and disagreement. When members agree with you, confirm
your shared point of view. When they disagree, acknowledge both sides of the issue
and support your own with strong, clearly-presented evidence.

 Encourage and coach. Buoy up members when they run into new and uncertain
situations and when success depends on their performing at a high level.

 Share information. Give members the information they need and let them know
that you’re knowledgeable about team tasks and individual talents. Check with team
members regularly to find out what they’re doing and how the job is progressing.

Key Take-Aways
1)

A team (or a work team) is a group of people with complementary
skills and diverse areas of expertise who work together to achieve a
specific goal.

2)

Work teams have five key characteristics:
a. They are accountable for achieving specific common goals.
b. They function interdependently.
c. They are stable.
d. They have authority.
e. They operate in a social context.

3)

Work teams may be of several types:
a. In the traditional manager-led team, the leader defines the
team’s goals and activities and is responsible for its achieving its
assigned goals.
b. The leader of a self-managing team may determine overall
goals, but employees control the activities needed to meet
them.
c. A cross-functional team is designed to take advantage of the
special expertise of members drawn from different functional
areas of the company.
d. On virtual teams, geographically dispersed members interact
electronically in the process of pursuing a common goal.

4)

Group cohesiveness refers to the attractiveness of a team to its
members. If a group is high in cohesiveness, membership is quite
satisfying to its members; if it’s low in cohesiveness, members are
unhappy with it and may even try to leave it.

5)

As the business world depends more and more on teamwork, it’s
increasingly important for incoming members of the workforce to
develop skills and experience in team-based activities.

6)

Every team requires some mixture of three skill sets:
a. Technical skills: skills needed to perform specific tasks
b. Decision-making and problem-solving skills: skills needed to
identify problems, evaluate alternative solutions, and decide on
the best options

Why Is Apple Successful?
In 1976 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created their first computer, the Apple I.30 They
invested a mere $1,300 and set up business in Jobs’ garage. Three decades later, their
business—Apple Inc.—has become one of the world’s most influential and successful
companies. Jobs and Wozniak were successful entrepreneurs: those who take the risks and
reap the rewards associated with starting a new business enterprise. Did you ever wonder why
Apple flourished while so many other young companies failed? How did it grow from a garage
start-up to a company generating over $233
billion in sales in 2015? How was it able to

Figure 1.1: Steve Jobs

transform itself from a nearly bankrupt firm to a
multinational corporation with locations all around
the world? You might conclude that it was the
company’s products, such as the Apple I and II, the
Macintosh, or more recently its wildly popular iPod,
iPhone, and iPad. Or, you could decide that it was its
dedicated employees, management’s wiliness to take
calculated risks, or just plain luck – that Apple simply
was in the right place at the right time.
Before we draw any conclusions about what made Apple what it is today and what will
propel it into a successful future, you might like to learn more about Steve Jobs, the company’s
cofounder and former CEO. Jobs was instrumental in the original design of the Apple I and, after
being ousted from his position with the company, returned to save the firm from destruction and
lead it onto its current path. Growing up, Jobs had an interest in computers. He attended
lectures at Hewlett-Packard after school and worked for the company during the summer
months. He took a job at Atari after graduating from high school and saved his money to make
a pilgrimage to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. Following his India trip, he attended
Steve Wozniak’s “Homebrew Computer Club” meetings, where the idea for building a personal
computer surfaced.31 “Many colleagues describe Jobs as a brilliant man who could be a great
motivator and positively charming. At the same time his drive for perfection was so strong that

employees who did not meet his demands [were] faced with blistering verbal attacks.”32 Not
everyone at Apple appreciated Jobs’ brilliance and ability to motivate. Nor did they all go along
with his willingness to do whatever it took to produce an innovative, attractive, high-quality
product. So at age thirty, Jobs found himself ousted from Apple by John Sculley, whom Jobs
himself had hired as president of the company several years earlier. It seems that Sculley
wanted to cut costs and thought it would be easier to do so without Jobs around. Jobs sold $20
million of his stock and went on a two-month vacation to figure out what he would do for the
rest of his life. His solution: start a new personal computer company called NextStep. In 1993,
he was invited back to Apple (a good thing, because neither his new company nor Apple was
doing well).
Steve Jobs was definitely not known for humility, but he was a visionary and had a right
to be proud of his accomplishments. Some have commented that “Apple’s most successful
days occurred with Steve Jobs at the helm.”33
Jobs did what many successful CEOs and managers do: he learned, adjusted, and
improvised.34 Perhaps the most important statement that can be made about him is this: he
never gave up on the company that once turned its back on him. So now you have the facts.
Here’s a multiple-choice question that you’ll likely get right: Apple’s success is due to (a) its
products, (b) its customers, (c) luck, (d) its willingness to take risks, (e) Steve Jobs, or (f) some
combination of these options.

Introduction
As the story of Apple suggests, today is an interesting time to study business. Advances
in technology are bringing rapid changes in the ways we produce and deliver goods and
services. The Internet and other improvements in communication (such as smartphones, video
conferencing, and social networking) now affect the way we do business. Companies are
expanding international operations, and the workforce is more diverse than ever. Corporations
are being held responsible for the behavior of their executives, and more people share the
opinion that companies should be good corporate citizens. Because of the role they played in

the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, businesses today face increasing scrutiny
and negative public sentiment.35
Economic turmoil that began in the housing and mortgage industries as a result of
troubled subprime mortgages quickly spread to the rest of the economy. In 2008, credit
markets froze up and banks stopped making loans. Lawmakers tried to get money flowing
again by passing a $700 billion Wall Street bailout, now-cautious banks became reluctant to
extend credit. Without money or credit, consumer confidence in the economy dropped and
consumers cut back on spending. Unemployment rose as troubled companies shed the most
jobs in five years, and 760,000 Americans marched to the unemployment lines.36 The stock
market reacted to the financial crisis and its stock prices dropped by 44 percent while millions
of Americans watched in shock as their savings and retirement accounts took a nose dive. In
fall 2008, even Apple, a company that had enjoyed strong sales growth over the past five
years, began to cut production of its popular iPhone. Without jobs or cash, consumers would
no longer flock to Apple’s fancy retail stores or buy a prized iPhone.37 Since then, things have
turned around for Apple, which continues to report blockbuster sales and profits. But not all
companies or individuals are doing so well. The economy is still struggling, unemployment is
high (particularly for those ages 16 to 24), and home prices have not fully rebounded from the
crisis.
As you go through the course with the aid of this text, you’ll explore the exciting world of
business. We’ll introduce you to the various activities in which business people engage—
accounting, finance, information technology, management, marketing, and operations. We’ll
help you understand the roles that these activities play in an organization, and we’ll show you
how they work together. We hope that by exposing you to the things that businesspeople do,
we’ll help you decide whether business is right for you and, if so, what areas of business you’d
like to study further.

Getting Down to Business
A business is any activity that provides goods or services to consumers for the purpose
of making a profit. Be careful not to confuse the terms revenue and profit. Revenue represents
the funds an enterprise receives in exchange for its goods or services. Profit is what’s left
(hopefully) after all the bills are paid. When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched the Apple
I, they created Apple Computer in Jobs’ family garage in the hope of making a profit. Before
we go on, let’s make a couple of important distinctions concerning the terms in our definitions.
First, whereas Apple produces and sells goods (Mac, iPhone, iPod, iPad, Apple Watch), many
businesses provide services. Your bank is a service company, as is your Internet provider.
Hotels, airlines, law firms, movie theaters, and hospitals are also service companies. Many
companies provide both goods and services. For example, your local car dealership sells
goods (cars) and also provides services (automobile repairs). Second, some organizations are
not set up to make profits. Many are established to provide social or educational services.
Such not-for profit (or nonprofit), organizations include the United Way of America, Habitat for
Humanity, the Boys and Girls Clubs, the Sierra Club, the American Red Cross, and many
colleges and universities. Most of these organizations, however, function in much the same
way as a business. They establish goals and work to meet them in an effective, efficient
manner. Thus, most of the business principles introduced in this text also apply to nonprofits.

Business Participants and Activities
Let’s begin our discussion of business by identifying the main participants of business
and the functions that most businesses perform. Then we’ll finish this section by discussing the
external factors that influence a business’ activities.

Participants
Every business must have one or more owners whose primary role is to invest money
in the business. When a business is being started, it’s generally the owners who polish the
business idea and bring together the resources (money and people) needed to turn the idea
into a business. The owners also hire employees to work for the company and help it reach its
goals. Owners and employees depend on a third group of participants— customers.

Ultimately, the goal of any business is to satisfy the needs of its customers in order to generate
a profit for the owners.

Stakeholders
Consider your favorite restaurant. It may be an outlet or franchise of a national chain
(more on franchises in a later chapter) or a local “mom and pop” without affiliation to a larger
entity. Whether national or local, every business has stakeholders – those with a legitimate
interest in the success or failure of the business and the policies it adopts. Stakeholders
include customers, vendors, employees, landlords, bankers, and others (see Figure 1.2). All
have a keen interest in how the business operates, in most cases for obvious reasons. If the
business fails, employees will need new jobs, vendors will need new customers, and banks
may have to write off loans they made to the business. Stakeholders do not always see things
the same way – their interests sometimes conflict with each other. For example, lenders are
more likely to appreciate high profit margins that ensure the loans they made will be repaid,
while customers would probably appreciate the lowest possible prices. Pleasing stakeholders
can be a real balancing act for any company.

Functional Areas of Business
The activities needed to operate a business can be divided into a number of functional
areas. Examples include: management, operations, marketing, accounting, and finance. Let’s
briefly explore each of these areas.

Management
Managers are responsible for the work performance of other people. Management
involves planning for, organizing, leading, and controlling a company’s resources so that it can
achieve its goals. Managers plan by setting goals and developing strategies for achieving
them. They organize activities and resources to ensure that company goals are met and staff
the organization with qualified employees and managers lead them to accomplish
organizational goals. Finally, managers design controls for assessing the success of plans
and decisions and take corrective action when needed.

Operations
All companies must convert resources (labor, materials, money, information, and so
forth) into goods or services. Some companies, such as Apple, convert resources into tangible
products—Macs, iPhones, etc. Others, such as hospitals, convert resources into intangible
products — e.g., health care. The person who designs and oversees the transformation of
resources into goods or services is called an operations manager. This individual is also
responsible for ensuring that products are of high quality.

Marketing
Marketing consists of everything that a company does to identify customers’ needs (i.e.
market research) and design products to meet those needs. Marketers develop the benefits
and features of products, including price and quality. They also decide on the best method of
delivering products and the best means of promoting them to attract and keep customers.
They manage relationships with customers and make them aware of the organization’s desire
and ability to satisfy their needs.

Accounting
Managers need accurate, relevant and timely financial information, which is provided by
accountants. Accountants measure, summarize, and communicate financial and managerial
information and advise other managers on financial matters. There are two fields of
accounting. Financial accountants prepare financial statements to help users, both inside and
outside the organization, assess the financial strength of the company. Managerial accountants
prepare information, such as reports on the cost of materials used in the production process,
for internal use only.

Finance
Finance involves planning for, obtaining, and managing a company’s funds. Financial
managers address such questions as the following: How much money does the company
need? How and where will it get the necessary money? How and when will it pay the money
back? What investments should be made in plant and equipment? How much should be spent
on research and development? Good financial management is particularly important when a
company is first formed, because new business owners usually need to borrow money to get
started.

External Forces that Influence Business
Activities
Apple and other businesses don’t operate in a vacuum: they’re influenced by a number
of external factors. These include the economy, government, consumer trends, technological
developments, public pressure to act as good corporate citizens, and other factors.
Collectively, these forces constitute what is known as the “macro environment” – essentially
the big picture world outside over which the business exerts very little if any control. Figure 1.3
"Business and Its Environment" sums up the relationship between a business and the external
forces that influence its activities. One industry that’s clearly affected by all these factors is the
fast-food industry. Companies such as Taco Bell, McDonald’s, Cook-Out and others all

compete in this industry. A strong economy means people have more money to eat out. Food
standards are monitored by a government agency, the Food and Drug Administration.
Preferences for certain types of foods are influenced by consumer trends (fast food
companies are being pressured to make their menus healthier). Finally, a number of decisions
made by the industry result from its desire to be a good corporate citizen. For example, several
fast-food chains have responded to environmental concerns by eliminating Styrofoam
containers.38
Of course, all industries are impacted by external factors, not just the food industry. As
people have become more conscious of the environment, they have begun to choose new
technologies, like all-electric cars to replace those that burn fossil fuels. Both established
companies, like Nissan with its Nissan Leaf, and brand new companies like Tesla have
entered the market for all-electric vehicles. While the market is still small, it is expected to grow
at a compound annual growth rate of 19.2% between 2013 and 2019.39
As you move through this text, you’ll learn more about these external influences on
business.

Key Take-Aways

1)

The main participants in a business are its owners, employees, and
customers.

2)

Every business must consider its stakeholders, and their sometimes
conflicting interests, when making decisions.

3)

The activities needed to run a business can be divided into functional
areas. The business functions correspond fairly closely to many
majors found within a typical college of business.

4)

Businesses are influenced by such external factors as the economy,
government, and other forces external to the business.

What is Economics?
To appreciate how a business functions, we need to know something about the
economic environment in which it operates. We begin with a definition of economics and a
discussion of the resources used to produce goods and services.

Resources: Inputs and Outputs
Economics is the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and
services. Resources are the inputs used to produce outputs. Resources may include any or all
of the following:

 Land and other natural resources
 Labor (physical and mental)
 Capital, including buildings and equipment
 Entrepreneurship
 Knowledge
Resources are combined to produce goods and services. Land and natural resources
provide the needed raw materials. Labor transforms raw materials into goods and services.
Capital (equipment, buildings, vehicles, cash, and so forth) are needed for the production
process. Entrepreneurship provides the skill, drive and creativity needed to bring the other
resources together to produce a good or service to be sold to the marketplace.
Because a business uses resources to produce things, we also call these resources
factors of production. The factors of production used to produce a shirt would include the
following:

 The land that the shirt factory sits on, the electricity used to run the plant, and the
raw cotton from which the shirts are made

 The laborers who make the shirts
 The factory and equipment used in the manufacturing process, as well as the
money needed to operate the factory

 The entrepreneurship skills and production knowledge used to coordinate the
other resources to make the shirts and distribute them to the marketplace

Input and Output Markets
Many of the factors of production are provided to businesses by households. For
example, households provide businesses with labor (as workers), land and buildings (as
landlords), and capital (as investors). In turn, businesses pay households for these resources
by providing them with income, such as wages, rent, and interest. The resources obtained
from households are then used by businesses to produce goods and services, which are sold
to provide businesses with revenue. The revenue obtained by businesses is then used to buy
additional resources, and the cycle continues. This is described in Figure 2.1 “The Circular
Flow of Inputs and Outputs”, which illustrates the dual roles of households and businesses:

 Households not only provide factors of production (or resources) but also
consume goods and services.

 Businesses not only buy resources but also produce and sell both goods and
services

Economic Systems
Economists study the interactions between households and businesses and look at the
ways in which the factors of production are combined to produce the goods and services that
people need. Basically, economists try to answer three sets of questions:
1) What goods and services should be produced to meet consumers’ needs? In
what quantity? When?
2) How should goods and services be produced? Who should produce them, and
what resources, including technology, should be combined to produce them?
3) Who should receive the goods and services produced? How should they be
allocated among consumers?
The answers to these questions depend on a country’s economic system—the means
by which a society (households, businesses, and government) makes decisions about
allocating resources to produce products and about distributing those products. The degree to
which individuals and business owners, as opposed to the government, enjoy freedom in
making these decisions varies according to the type of economic system.
Generally speaking, economic systems can be divided into two systems: planned
systems and free market systems.

Planned Systems
In a planned system, the government exerts control over the allocation and distribution
of all or some goods and services. The system with the highest level of government control is
communism. In theory, a communist economy is one in which the government owns all or most
enterprises. Central planning by the government dictates which goods or services are
produced, how they are produced, and who will receive them. In practice, pure communism is
practically nonexistent today, and only a few countries (notably North Korea and Cuba)
operate under rigid, centrally planned economic systems.
Under socialism, industries that provide essential services, such as utilities, banking,
and health care, may be government owned. Some businesses may also be owned privately.
Central planning allocates the goods and services produced by government-run industries and
tries to ensure that the resulting wealth is distributed equally. In contrast, privately owned

Chapter 2

companies are operated for the purpose of making a profit for their owners. In general, workers
in socialist economies work fewer hours, have longer vacations, and receive more health care,
education, and child-care benefits than do workers in capitalist economies. To offset the high
cost of public services, taxes are generally steep. Examples of countries that lean towards a
socialistic approach include Venezuela, Sweden, and France.

Free Market System
The economic system in which most businesses are owned and operated by individuals
is the free market system, also known as capitalism. In a free market economy, competition
dictates how goods and services will be allocated. Business is conducted with more limited
government involvement concentrated on regulations that dictate how businesses are
permitted to operate. A key aspect of a free market system is the concept of private property
rights, which means that business owners can expect to own their land, buildings, machines,
etc., and keep the majority of their profits, except for taxes. The profit incentive is a key driver
of any free market system. The economies of the United States and other countries, such as
Japan, are based on capitalism. However, a purely capitalistic economy is as rare as one that
is purely communist. Imagine if a service such as police protection, one provided by
government in the United States, were instead allocated based on market forces. The ability to
pay would then become a key determinant in who received these services, an outcome that
few in American society would consider to be acceptable.

How Economic Systems Compare
In comparing economic systems, it can be helpful to think of a continuum with
communism at one end and pure capitalism at the other, as in Figure 2.2 on the next page. As
you move from left to right, the amount of government control over business diminishes. So,
too, does the level of social services, such as health care, child-care services, social security,
and unemployment benefits. Moving from left to right, taxes are correspondingly lower as well.

Figure 2.2: The Economic Spectrum

Mixed Market Economies
Though it’s possible to have a pure communist system, or a pure capitalist (free market)
system, in reality many economic systems are mixed. A mixed market economy relies on
both markets and the government to allocate resources. In practice, most economies are
mixed, with a leaning towards either free market or socialistic principles, rather than being
purely one or the other. Some previously communist economies, such as those of Eastern
Europe and China, are becoming more mixed as they adopt more capitalistic characteristics
and convert businesses previously owned by the government to private ownership through a
process called privatization. By contrast, Venezuela is a country that has moved increasingly
towards socialism, taking control of industries such as oil and media through a process called
nationalization.

The U.S. Economic System
Like most countries, the United States features a mixed market system: though the U.S.
economic system is primarily a free market system, the federal government controls some
basic services, such as the postal service and air traffic control. The U.S. economy also has
some characteristics of a socialist system, such as providing social security retirement benefits
to retired workers.
The free market system was espoused by Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of
Nations, published in 1776. According to Smith, competition alone would ensure that

Chapter 2

consumers received the best products at the best prices. In the kind of competition he
assumed, a seller who tries to charge more for his product than other sellers would not be able
to find any buyers. A job-seeker who asks more than the going wage won’t be hired. Because
the “invisible hand” of competition will make the market work effectively, there won’t be a need
to regulate prices or wages. Almost immediately, however, a tension developed among free
market theorists between the principle of laissez-faire—leaving things alone—and
government intervention. Today, it’s common for the U.S. government to intervene in the
operation of the economic system. For example, government exerts influence on the food and
pharmaceutical industries through the Food and Drug Administration, which protects
consumers by preventing unsafe or mislabeled products from reaching the market.
To appreciate how businesses operate, we must first get an idea of how prices are set
in competitive markets. The next section, “Perfect Competition and Supply and Demand,”
begins by describing how markets establish prices in an environment of perfect competition.

Perfect Competition and Supply and
Demand
Under a mixed economy, such as we have in the United States, businesses make
decisions about which goods to produce or services to offer and how they are priced. Because
there are many businesses making goods or providing services, customers can choose among
a wide array of products. The competition for sales among businesses is a vital part of our
economic system. Economists have identified four types of competition—perfect competition,
monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. We’ll introduce the first of these—perfect
competition—in this section and cover the remaining three in the following section.

Perfect Competition
Perfect competition exists when there are many consumers buying a standardized
product from numerous small businesses. Because no seller is big enough or influential
enough to affect price, sellers and buyers accept the going price. For example, when a

39

commercial fisher brings his fish to the local market, he has little control over the price he gets
and must accept the going market price.

The Basics of Supply and Demand
To appreciate how perfect competition works, we need to understand how buyers and
sellers interact in a market to set prices. In a market characterized by perfect competition, price
is determined through the mechanisms of supply and demand. Prices are influenced both by
the supply of products from sellers and by the demand for products by buyers.
To illustrate this concept, let’s create a supply and demand schedule for one particular
good sold at one point in time. Then we’ll define demand and create a demand curve and
define supply and create a supply curve. Finally, we’ll see how supply and demand interact to
create an equilibrium price—the price at which buyers are willing to purchase the amount that
sellers are willing to sell.

Demand and the Demand Curve
Demand is the quantity of a product that buyers are willing to purchase at various
prices. The quantity of a product that people are willing to buy depends on its price. You’re
typically willing to buy less of a product when prices rise and more of a product when prices
fall. Generally speaking, we find products more attractive at lower prices, and we buy more at
lower prices because our income goes further.
Using this logic, we can construct a

Figure 2.3: The Demand Curve

demand curve that shows the quantity of
a product that will be demanded at
different prices. Let’s assume that the
diagram in Figure 2.3 “The Demand
Curve” represents the daily price and
quantity of apples sold by farmers at a
local market. Note that as the price of
apples goes down, buyers’ demand goes
up. Thus, if a pound of apples sells for
$0.80, buyers will be willing to purchase

40

Chapter 2

only fifteen hundred pounds per day. But if apples cost only $0.60 a pound, buyers will be
willing to purchase two thousand pounds. At $0.40 a pound, buyers will be willing to purchase
twenty-five hundred pounds.

Supply and the Supply Curve

Figure 2.4: The Supply Curve

Supply is the quantity of a product that
sellers are willing to sell at various prices. The
quantity of a product that a business is willing to
sell depends on its price. Businesses are more
willing to sell a product when the price rises and
less willing to sell it when prices fall. Again, this
fact makes sense: businesses are set up to
make profits, and there are larger profits to be
made when prices are high.
Now we can construct a supply curve
that shows the quantity of apples that farmers
would be willing to sell at different prices,
regardless of demand. As you can see in
Figure 2.4 “The Supply Curve”, the supply curve goes in the opposite direction from the
demand curve: as prices rise, the quantity of apples that farmers are willing to sell also goes
up. The supply curve shows that farmers are willing to sell only a thousand pounds of apples
when the price is $0.40 a pound, two thousand pounds when the price is $0.60, and three
thousand pounds when the price is $0.80.

Equilibrium Price
We can now see how the market mechanism works under perfect competition. We do
this by plotting both the supply curve and the demand curve on one graph, as we’ve done in
Figure 2.5 “The Equilibrium Price”. The point at which the two curves intersect is the
equilibrium price.

Chapter 2

41

You can see in Figure 2.5 “The Equilibrium Price” that the supply and demand curves
intersect at the price of $0.60 and quantity of two thousand pounds. Thus,$0.60 is the
equilibrium price: at this price, the quantity of apples demanded by buyers equals the quantity
of apples that farmers are willing to supply. If a single farmer tries to charge more than $0.60
for a pound of apples, he won’t sell very many because other suppliers are making them
available for less. As a result, his profits will go
down. If, on the other hand, a farmer tries to

Figure 2.5: The Equilibrium Price

charge less than the equilibrium price of $0.60 a
pound, he will sell more apples but his profit per
pound will be less than at the equilibrium price.
With profit being the motive, there is no incentive
to drop the price.
What have we learned in this discussion?
Without outside influences, markets in an
environment of perfect competition will arrive at
an equilibrium point at which both buyers and
sellers are satisfied. But we must be aware that
this is a very simplistic example. Things are much more complex in the real world. For one
thing, markets rarely operate without outside influences. Sometimes, sellers supply more of a
product than buyers are willing to purchase; in that case, there’s a surplus. Sometimes, they
don’t produce enough of a product to satisfy demand; then we have a shortage.
Circumstances also have a habit of changing. What would happen, for example, if
incomes rose and buyers were willing to pay more for apples? The demand curve would
change, resulting in an increase in equilibrium price. This outcome makes intuitive sense: as
demand increases, prices will go up. What would happen if apple crops were larger than
expected because of favorable weather conditions? Farmers might be willing to sell apples at
lower prices rather than letting part of the crop spoil. If so, the supply curve would shift,
resulting in another change in equilibrium price: the increase in supply would bring down
prices.

Monopolistic Competition, Oligopoly, and
Monopoly
As mentioned previously, economists have identified four types of competition—perfect
competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. Perfect competition was
discussed in the last section; we’ll cover the remaining three types of competition here.

Monopolistic Competition
In monopolistic competition, we still have many sellers (as we had under perfect
competition). Now, however, they don’t sell identical products. Instead, they sell differentiated
products—products that differ somewhat, or are perceived to differ, even though they serve a
similar purpose. Products can be differentiated in a number of ways, including quality, style,
convenience, location, and brand name. Some people prefer Coke over Pepsi, even though
the two products are quite similar. But what if there was a substantial price difference between
the two? In that case, buyers could be persuaded to switch from one to the other. Thus, if
Coke has a big promotional sale at a supermarket chain, some Pepsi drinkers might switch (at
least temporarily).
How is product differentiation accomplished? Sometimes, it’s simply geographical; you
probably buy gasoline at the station closest to your home regardless of the brand. At other
times, perceived differences between products are promoted by advertising designed to
convince consumers that one product is different from an- other—and better than it.
Regardless of customer loyalty to a product, however, if its price goes too high, the seller will
lose business to a competitor. Under monopolistic competition, therefore, companies have only
limited control over price.

Oligopoly
Oligopoly means few sellers. In an oligopolistic market, each seller supplies a large
portion of all the products sold in the marketplace. In addition, because the cost of starting a
business in an oligopolistic industry is usually high, the number of firms entering it is low.
Companies in oligopolistic industries include such large-scale enterprises as automobile
Chapter 2

43

companies and airlines. As large firms supplying a sizable portion of a market, these
companies have some control over the prices they charge. But there’s a catch: because
products are fairly similar, when one company lowers prices, others are often forced to follow
suit to remain competitive. You see this practice all the time in the airline industry: When
American Airlines announces a fare decrease, Continental, United Airlines, and others do
likewise. When one automaker offers a special deal, its competitors usually come up with
similar promotions.

Monopoly
In terms of the number of sellers and degree of competition, a monopoly lies at the
opposite end of the spectrum from perfect competition. In perfect competition, there are many
small companies, none of which can control prices; they simply accept the market price
determined by supply and demand. In a monopoly, however, there’s only one seller in the
market. The market could be a geographical area, such as a city or a regional area, and
doesn’t necessarily have to be an entire country.
There are few monopolies in the United States because the government limits them.
Most fall into one of two categories: natural and legal. Natural monopolies include public
utilities, such as electricity and gas suppliers. Such enterprises require huge investments, and
it would be inefficient to duplicate the products that they provide. They inhibit competition, but
they’re legal because they’re important to society. In exchange for the right to conduct
business without competition, they’re regulated. For instance, they can’t charge whatever
prices they want, but they must adhere to government-controlled prices. As a rule, they’re
required to serve all customers, even if doing so isn’t cost efficient.
A legal monopoly arises when a company receives a patent giving it exclusive use of
an invented product or process. Patents are issued for a limited time, generally twenty years.40
During this period, other companies can’t use the invented product or process without
permission from the patent holder. Patents allow companies a certain period to recover the
heavy costs of researching and developing products and technologies. A classic example of a
company that enjoyed a patent-based legal monopoly is Polaroid, which for years held
exclusive ownership of instant-film technology.41 Polaroid priced the product high enough to

recoup, over time, the high cost of bringing it to market. Without competition, in other words, it
enjoyed a monopolistic position in regard to pricing.

Measuring the Health of the Economy
Every day, we are bombarded with economic news (at least if you watch the business
news stations). We’re told about things like unemployment, home prices, and consumer
confidence trends. As a student learning about business, and later as a business manager,
you need to understand the nature of the U.S. economy and the terminology that we use to
describe it. You need to have some idea of where the economy is heading, and you need to
know something about the government’s role in influencing its direction.

Economic Goals
The world’s economies share three main goals:

 Growth
 High employment
 Price stability
Let’s take a closer look at each of these goals, both to find out what they mean and to
show how we determine whether they’re being met.

Economic Growth
One purpose of an economy is to provide people with goods and services—cars,
computers, video games, houses, rock concerts, fast food, amusement parks. One way in
which economists measure the performance of an economy is by looking at a widely used
measure of total output called the gross domestic product (GDP). The GDP is defined as the
market value of all goods and services produced by the economy in a given year. The GDP
includes only those goods and services produced domestically; goods produced outside the
country are excluded. The GDP also includes only those goods and services that are produced
for the final user; intermediate products are excluded. For example, the silicon chip that goes
into a computer (an intermediate product) would not count directly because it is included when
the finished computer is counted. By itself, the GDP doesn’t necessarily tell us much about the
Chapter 2

45

direction of the economy. But change in the GDP does. If the GDP (after adjusting for inflation,
which will be discussed later) goes up, the economy is growing. If it goes down, the economy
is contracting.

The Business Cycle
The economic ups and downs resulting from expansion and contraction constitute the
business cycle. A typical cycle runs from three to five years but could last much longer.
Though typically irregular, a cycle can be divided into four general phases of prosperity,
recession, depression (which the cycle generally skips), and recovery:

 During prosperity, the economy expands, unemployment is low, in- comes rise, and
consumers buy more products. Businesses respond by increasing production and
offering new and better products.

 Eventually, however, things slow down. GDP decreases, unemployment rises, and
because people have less money to spend, business revenues decline. This
slowdown in economic activity is called a recession.

 Economists often say that we’re entering a recession when GDP goes down for two
consecutive quarters.

 Generally, a recession is followed by a recovery in which the economy starts
growing again.

 If, however, a recession lasts a long time (perhaps a decade or so), while
unemployment remains very high and production is severely curtailed, the economy
could sink into a depression. Unlike for the term recession, economists have not
agreed on a uniform standard for what constitutes a depression, though they are
generally characterized by their duration. Though not impossible, it’s unlikely that the
United States will experience another severe depression like that of the 1930s. The
federal government has a number of economic tools (some of which we’ll discuss
shortly) with which to fight any threat of a depression.

Full Employment
To keep the economy going strong, people must spend money on goods and services.
A reduction in personal expenditures for things like food, clothing, appliances, automobiles,
housing, and medical care could severely reduce GDP and weaken the economy. Because
46

Chapter 2

most people earn their spending money by working, an important goal of all economies is
making jobs available to everyone who wants one. In principle, full employment occurs when
everyone who wants to work has a job. In practice, we say that we have full employment when
about 95 percent of those wanting to work are employed.

The Unemployment Rate
The U.S. Department of Labor tracks unemployment and reports the unemployment
rate: the percentage of the labor force that’s unemployed and actively seeking work. The
unemployment rate is an important measure of economic health. It goes up during
recessionary periods because companies are reluctant to hire workers when demand for
goods and services is low. Conversely, it goes down when the economy is expanding and
there is high demand for products and workers to supply them.
Figure 2.6 “The U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1970–2010” traces the U.S. unemployment
rate between 1970 and 2010. Please be aware that there are multiple measures of
unemployment and that this graph is based on
what is known as U3, the most commonly used Figure 2.6: The U.S. Unemployment Rate,
1970-2014
measurement. Another measurement, U6,
is considered to provide a broader picture
of unemployment in the United States. It
includes two groups of people that U3
doesn’t: those who are not actively looking
for work but would like a job and have
looked for one in the last 12 months; and
those who would like to work full-time jobs
but have settled for part-time positions
because full-time work was not available to
them. Since by definition, U6 is always
higher than U3, it is likely that U3 is
discussed more often because it paints a
more favorable, if not completely accurate,
picture.

Price Stability
A third major goal of all

Figure 2.7: The U.S. Inflation Rate, 1960-2014

economies is maintaining price
stability. Price stability occurs when
the average of the prices for goods
and services either doesn’t change
or changes very little. Rapidly rising
prices are troublesome for both
individuals and businesses. For
individuals, rising prices mean
people have to pay more for the
things they need. For businesses,
rising prices mean higher costs,
and, at least in the short run,
businesses might have trouble
passing on higher costs to
consumers. When the overall price level goes up, we have inflation. Figure 2.7 “The U.S.
Inflation Rate, 1960–2010” shows inflationary trends in the U.S. economy since 1960. When
the price level goes down (which rarely happens), we have deflation. A deflationary situation
can also be damaging to an economy. When purchasers believe they can expect lower prices
in the future, they may defer making purchases, which has the effect of slowing economic
growth. Japan experienced a long period of deflation which contributed to economic stagnation
in that country from which it is only now beginning to recover.

The Consumer Price Index
The most widely publicized measure of inflation is the consumer price index (CPI),
which is reported monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI measures the rate of
inflation by determining price changes of a hypothetical basket of goods, such as food,
housing, clothing, medical care, appliances, automobiles, and so forth, bought by a typical
household.

Conversely, you would have needed $2.18
to purchase the same $1 worth of typical
goods in 2010. The difference registers the
effect of inflation. In fact, that’s what an
inflation rate is—the percentage change in
a price index.

Economic Forecasting
In the previous section, we introduced several measures that economists use to assess
the performance of the economy at a given time. By looking at changes in the GDP, for
instance, we can see whether the economy is growing. The CPI allows us to gauge inflation.
These measures help us understand where the economy stands today. But what if we want to
get a sense of where it’s headed in the future? To a certain extent, we can forecast future
economic trends by analyzing several leading economic indicators.

Economic Indicators
An economic indicator is a statistic that provides valuable information about the
economy. There’s no shortage of economic indicators, and trying to follow them all would be
an overwhelming task. So in this chapter, we’ll only discuss the general concept and a few of
the key indicators.

Lagging and Leading Indicators
Statistics that report the status of the economy a few months in the past are called
lagging economic indicators. One such indicator is average length of unemployment. If
unemployed workers have remained out of work for a long time, we may infer that the

economy has been slow. Indicators that predict the status of the economy three to twelve
months into the future are called leading economic indicators. If such an indicator rises, the
economy is more likely to expand in the coming year. If it falls, the economy is more likely to
contract.
It is also helpful to look at indicators from various sectors of the economy— labor,
manufacturing, and housing. One useful indicator of the outlook for future jobs is the number of
new claims for unemployment insurance. This measure tells us how many people recently lost
their jobs. If it’s rising, it signals trouble ahead because unemployed consumers can’t buy as
many goods and services as they could if they had paychecks.
To gauge the level of goods to be produced in the future (which will translate into future
sales), economists look at a statistic called average weekly manufacturing hours. This
measure tells us the average number of hours worked per week by production workers in
manufacturing industries. If it’s on the rise, the economy will probably improve. For assessing
the strength of the housing market, housing starts is often a good indicator. An increase in this
statistic—which tells us how many new housing units are being built—indicates that the
economy is improving. Why? Because increased building brings money into the economy not
only through new home sales but also through sales of furniture and appliances to furnish
them.
Since employment is such a key goal in any economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
tracks total non-farm payroll employment from which the number of net new jobs created can
be determined.
The Conference Board also publishes a consumer confidence index based on results of
a monthly survey of five thousand U.S. households. The survey gathers consumers’ opinions
on the health of the economy and their plans for future purchases. It’s often a good indicator of
consumers’ future buying intent.

Government’s Role in Managing the Economy
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is exercised by the Federal Reserve System (“the Fed”), which is
empowered to take various actions that decrease or increase the money supply and raise or
lower short-term interest rates, making it harder or easier to borrow money. When the Fed
believes that inflation is a problem, it will use contractionary policy to decrease the money
supply and raise interest rates. When rates are higher, borrowers have to pay more for the
money they borrow, and banks are more selective in making loans. Because money is
“tighter”—more expensive to borrow—demand for goods and services will go down, and so will
prices. In any case, that’s the theory.

The Fed will typically tighten or decrease the money supply during
inflationary periods, making it harder to borrow money.
To counter a recession, the Fed uses expansionary policy to increase the money supply
and reduce interest rates. With lower interest rates, it’s cheaper to borrow money, and banks
are more willing to lend it. We then say that money is “easy.” Attractive interest rates
encourage businesses to borrow money to expand production and encourage consumers to
buy more goods and services. In theory, both sets of actions will help the economy escape or
come out of a recession.

Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy relies on the government’s powers of spending and taxation. Both
taxation and government spending can be used to reduce or increase the total supply of
money in the economy—the total amount, in other words, that businesses and consumers
have to spend. When the country is in a recession, government policy is typically to increase
spending, reduce taxes, or both. Such expansionary actions will put more money in the hands
of businesses and consumers, encouraging businesses to expand and consumers to buy more
goods and services. When the economy is experiencing inflation, the opposite policy is
adopted: the government will decrease spending or increase taxes, or both. Because such

contractionary measures reduce spending by businesses and consumers, prices come down
and inflation eases.

The National Debt
If, in any given year, the government takes in more money (through taxes) than it
spends on goods and services (for things such as defense, transportation, and social
services), the result is a budget surplus. If, on the other hand, the government spends more
than it takes in, we have a budget deficit (which the government pays off by borrowing
through the issuance of Treasury bonds). Historically, deficits have occurred much more often
than surpluses; typically, the government spends more than it takes in. Consequently, the U.S.
government now has a total national debt of more than $19 trillion (Note: This number is
moving too quickly for the authors to keep the graph current – you can see the current debt at
http://www.usdebtclock.org/).

Economics is the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of
goods and services.
Economists address these three questions: (1) What goods and services
should be produced to meet consumer needs? (2) How should they be
produced, and who should produce them? (3) Who should receive goods
and services?
The answers to these questions depend on a country’s economic system.
The primary economic systems that exist today are planned and free
market systems.
In a planned system, such as communism and socialism, the government
exerts control over the production and distribution of all or some goods and
services.
In a free market system, also known as capitalism, business is conducted
with only limited government involvement. Competition determines what
goods and services are produced, how they are produced, and for whom.
In a free market system, buyers and sellers interact in a market to set
prices.
When the market is characterized by perfect competition, many small
companies sell identical products. The price is determined by supply and
demand.
Supply is the quantity of a product that sellers are willing to sell at various
prices. Price also inﬂuences the quantity of a product that producers are
willing to supply: they’ll sell more of a product when prices are high and less
when they’re low.
Demand is the quantity of a product that buyers are willing to purchase at
various prices. The quantity of a product that people will buy depends on its
price: they’ll buy more when the price is low and less when it’s high.

Key Take-Aways
10) In a competitive market, the decisions of buyers and sellers interact until the
market reaches an equilibrium price—the price at which buyers are willing
to buy the same amount that sellers are willing to sell.

11) There are four types of competition in a free market system: perfect
competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.

12) Under perfect competition, many sellers oﬀer diﬀerentiated products—
products that diﬀer slightly but serve similar purposes. By making
consumers aware of product diﬀerences, sellers exert some control over
price.

13) In an oligopoly, a few sellers supply a sizable portion of products in the
market. They exert some control over price, but because their products are
similar, when one company lowers prices, the others follow.

14) In a monopoly, there is only one seller in the market. The market could be
a geographical area, such as a city or a regional area, and does not
necessarily have to be an entire country. The single seller is able to control
prices.

15) Most monopolies fall into one of two categories: natural and legal.
16) Natural monopolies include public utilities, such as electricity and gas
suppliers. They inhibit competition, but they’re legal because they’re
important to society.

17) A legal monopoly arises when a company receives a patent giving it
exclusive use of an invented product or process for a limited time, generally
twenty years.

18) All economies share three goals: growth, high employment, and price
stability.

19) Growth. An economy provides people with goods and services, and
economists measure its performance by studying the gross domestic
product (GDP)—the market value of all goods and services produced by the
economy in a given year. If the GDP goes up, the economy is growing; if it
goes down, the economy is contracting.

20) High employment.

Because most people earn their money by working, a
goal of all economies is making jobs available to everyone who wants one.
The U.S. government reports an unemployment rate—the percentage of the
labor force that’s unemployed and actively seeking work. The
unemployment rate goes up during recessionary periods and down when
the economy is expanding.

21) Price stability. When the average prices of products either don’t change or
change very little, price stability occurs. When overall prices go up, we have
inﬂation; when they go down, we have deﬂation. The consumer price index
(CPI) measures inﬂation by determining the change in prices of a
hypothetical basket of goods bought by a typical household.

22) To get a sense of where the economy is headed in the future, we use
statistics called economic indicators. Indicators that, like average length
of unemployment, report the status of the economy a few months in the
past are lagging economic indicators. Those, like new claims for
unemployment insurance, that predict the status of the economy three to
twelve months in the future are leading economic indicators.

Introduction
“Mommy, Why Do You Have to Go to Jail?”
The one question Betty Vinson would have preferred to avoid is “Mommy, why do you
have to go to jail?”42 Vinson graduated with an accounting degree from Mississippi State and
married her college sweetheart. After a series of jobs at small banks, she landed a mid-level
accounting job at WorldCom, at the time still a small long-distance provider. Sparked by the
telecom boom, however, WorldCom soon became a darling of Wall Street, and its stock price
soared. Now working for a wildly successful company, Vinson rounded out her life by reading
legal thrillers and watching her daughter play soccer.
Her moment of truth came in mid-2000, when company executives learned that profits
had plummeted. They asked Vinson to make some accounting adjustments to boost income by
$828 million. Vinson knew that the scheme was unethical (at the very least) but she gave in
and made the adjustments. Almost immediately, she felt guilty and told her boss that she was
quitting. When news of her decision came to the attention of CEO Bernard Ebbers and CFO
Scott Sullivan, they hastened to assure Vinson that she’d never be asked to cook any more
books. Sullivan explained it this way: “We have planes in the air. Let’s get the planes landed.
Once they’ve landed, if you still want to leave, then leave. But not while the planes are in the
air.”43 Besides, she’d done nothing illegal, and if anyone asked, he’d take full responsibility. So
Vinson decided to stay. After all, Sullivan was one of the top CFOs in the country; at age thirtyseven, he was already making $19 million a year.44 Who was she to question his judgment?45
Six months later, Ebbers and Sullivan needed another adjustment—this time for $771
million. This scheme was even more unethical than the first: it entailed forging dates to hide
the adjustment. Pretty soon, Vinson was making adjustments on a quarterly basis—first for
$560 million, then for $743 million, and yet again for $941 million. Eventually, Vinson had
juggled almost $4 billion, and before long, the stress started to get to her: she had trouble
sleeping, lost weight, and withdrew from people at work. She decided to hang on when she got
a promotion and a $30,000 raise.

57

By spring 2002, however, it was obvious that adjusting the books was business as usual
at WorldCom. Vinson finally decided that it was time to move on, but, unfortunately, an internal
auditor had already put two and two together and blown the whistle. The Securities and
Exchange Commission charged WorldCom with fraud amounting to $11 billion—the largest in
U.S. history. Seeing herself as a valuable witness, Vinson was eager to tell what she knew.
The government, however, regarded her as more than a mere witness. When she was named
a co-conspirator, she agreed to cooperate fully and pleaded guilty to criminal conspiracy and
securities fraud. But she won’t be the only one doing time: Scott Sullivan will be in jail for five
years, and Bernie Ebbers will be locked up for twenty-five years. Both maintain that they are
innocent.46
So where did Betty Vinson, mild-mannered midlevel executive and mother, go wrong?
How did she manage to get involved in a scheme that not only bilked investors out of billions
but also cost seventeen thousand people their jobs?47 Ultimately, of course, we can only
guess. Maybe she couldn’t say no to her bosses; perhaps she believed that they’d take full
responsibility for her accounting “adjustments.” Possibly she was afraid of losing her job or
didn’t fully understand the ramifications of what she was doing. What we do know is that she
disgraced herself and went to jail.48
The WorldCom situation is not an isolated incident.
Perhaps you have heard of Bernie Madoff, founder of Bernard L.

Ponzi scheme50 that cheated investors of up to $65 billion. His
wrongdoings won him a spot at the top of Time Magazine’s Top
10 Crooked CEOs. According to the SEC charges, Madoff
convinced investors to give him large sums of money. In return,
he gave them an impressive 8 percent to 12 percent return a year.
But Madoff never really invested their money. Instead, he kept it
for himself. He got funds to pay the first investors their return (or
their money back if they asked for it) by bringing in new investors. Everything was going
smoothly until the fall of 2008, when the stock market plummeted and many of his investors
asked for their money. As he no longer had it, the game was over and he had to admit that the

whole thing was just one big lie. Thousands of investors, including many of his wealthy friends,
not-so-rich retirees who trusted him with their life savings, and charitable foundations, were
financially ruined. Those harmed by Madoff either directly or indirectly were likely pleased
when he was sentenced to jail for one-hundred and fifty years.

What is Business Ethics?
The Idea of Business Ethics
It’s in the best interest of a company to operate ethically. Trustworthy companies are
better at attracting and keeping customers, talented employees, and capital. Those tainted by
questionable ethics suffer from dwindling customer bases, employee turnover, and investor
mistrust.
Let’s begin this section by addressing this question: What can individuals,
organizations, and government agencies do to foster an environment of ethical behavior in
business? First, of course, we need to define the term.

What Is Ethics?
You probably already know what it means to be ethical: to know right from wrong and
to know when you’re practicing one instead of the other. We can say that business ethics is
the application of ethical behavior in a business context. Acting ethically in business means
more than simply obeying applicable laws and regulations: It also means being honest, doing
no harm to others, competing fairly, and declining to put your own interests above those of
your company, its owners, and its workers. If you’re in business you obviously need a strong
sense of what’s right and wrong. You need the personal conviction to do what’s right, even if it
means doing something that’s difficult or personally disadvantageous.

Why Study Ethics?
Ideally, prison terms, heavy fines, and civil suits would discourage corporate
misconduct, but, unfortunately, many experts suspect that this assumption is a bit optimistic.
Whatever the condition of the ethical environment in the near future, one thing seems clear:

the next generation entering business—which includes most of you—will find a world much
different than the one that waited for the previous generation. Recent history tells us in no
uncertain terms that today’s business students, many of whom are tomorrow’s business
leaders, need a much sharper understanding of the difference between what is and isn’t
ethically acceptable. As a business student, one of your key tasks is learning how to recognize
and deal with the ethical challenges that will confront you. Asked what he looked for in a new
hire, Warren Buffet, the world’s most successful investor, replied: “I look for three things. The
first is personal integrity, the second is intelligence, and the third is a high energy level.” He
paused and then added: “But if you don’t have the first, the second two don’t matter.” 51

Identifying Ethical Issues and Dilemmas
Ethical issues are the difficult social questions that involve some level of controversy
over what is the right thing to do. Environmental protection is an example of a commonly
discussed ethical issue, because there can be tradeoffs between environmental and economic
factors.
Ethical dilemmas are situations in which it is difficult for an individual to make
decisions either because the right course of action is unclear or carries some potential
negative consequences for the person or people involved.
Make no mistake about it: when you enter the business world, you’ll find yourself in
situations in which you’ll have to choose the appropriate behavior. How, for example, would
you answer questions like the following?
1) Is it OK to accept a pair of sports tickets from a supplier?
2) Can I buy office supplies from my brother-in-law?
3) Is it appropriate to donate company funds to a local charity?
4) If I find out that a friend is about to be fired, can I warn her?

Obviously, the types of situations are numerous and
varied. Fortunately, we can break them down into a few basic

Figure 3.2: How to maintain
honesty and integrity

categories: issues of honesty and integrity, conflicts of
interest and loyalty, bribes versus gifts, and whistle-blowing.
Let’s look a little more closely at each of these categories.

Issues of Honesty and Integrity
Master investor Warren Buffet once told a group of
business students the following: “I cannot tell you that
honesty is the best policy. I can’t tell you that if you behave
with perfect honesty and integrity somebody somewhere
won’t behave the other way and make more money. But
honesty is a good policy. You’ll do fine, you’ll sleep well at
night and you’ll feel good about the example you are setting
for your coworkers and the other people who care about
you.”52
If you work for a company that settles for its
employees’ merely obeying the law and following a few
internal regulations, you might think about moving on. If
you’re being asked to deceive customers about the quality
or value of your product, you’re in an ethically unhealthy
environment.

Think about this story:
“A chef put two frogs in a pot of warm soup
water. The first frog smelled the onions, recognized
the danger, and immediately jumped out. The second frog hesitated: The water
felt good, and he decided to stay and relax for a minute. After all, he could
always jump out when things got too hot (so to speak). As the water got hotter,
however, the frog adapted to it, hardly noticing the change. Before long, of
course, he was the main ingredient in frog-leg soup.”53

61

So, what’s the moral of the story? Don’t sit around in an ethically toxic environment and
lose your integrity a little at a time; get out before the water gets too hot and your options have
evaporated. Fortunately, a few rules of thumb can guide you.
We’ve summed them up in Figure 3.2 on the previous page.

Conflicts of Interest
Conflicts of interest occur when individuals must choose between taking actions that
promote their personal interests over the interests of others or taking actions that don’t. A
conflict can exist, for example, when an employee’s own interests interfere with, or have the
potential to interfere with, the best interests of the company’s stakeholders (management,
customers, and owners). Let’s say that you work for a company with a contract to cater events
at your college and that your uncle owns a local bakery. Obviously, this situation could create a
conflict of interest (or at least give the appearance of one—which is a problem in itself). When
you’re called on to furnish desserts for a luncheon, you might be tempted to send some
business your uncle’s way even if it’s not in the best interest of your employer. What should
you do? You should disclose the connection to your boss, who can then arrange things so that
your personal interests don’t conflict with the company’s.
The same principle holds that an employee shouldn’t use private information about an
employer for personal financial benefit. Say that you learn from a coworker at your
pharmaceutical company that one of its most profitable drugs will be pulled off the market
because of dangerous side effects. The recall will severely hurt the company’s financial
performance and cause its stock price to plummet. Before the news becomes public, you sell
all the stock you own in the company. What you’ve done is called insider trading – acting on
information that is not available to the general public, either by trading on it or providing it to
others who trade on it. Insider trading is illegal, and you could go to jail for it.

Conflicts of Loyalty
You may one day find yourself in a bind between being loyal either to your employer or
to a friend or family member. Perhaps you just learned that a coworker, a friend of yours, is
about to be downsized out of his job. You also happen to know that he and his wife are getting
ready to make a deposit on a house near the company headquarters. From a work standpoint,

62

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

Chapter 3

you know that you shouldn’t divulge the information. From a friendship standpoint, though, you
feel it’s your duty to tell your friend. Wouldn’t he tell you if the situation were reversed? So what
do you do? As tempting as it is to be loyal to your friend, you shouldn’t tell. As an employee,
your primary responsibility is to your employer. You might be able to soften your dilemma by
convincing a manager with the appropriate authority to tell your friend the bad news before he
puts down his deposit.

Bribes versus Gifts
It’s not uncommon in business to give and receive small gifts of appreciation, but when
is a gift unacceptable? When is it really a bribe?
There’s often a fine line between a gift and a bribe. The following information may help
in drawing it, because it raises key issues in determining how a gesture should be interpreted:
the cost of the item, the timing of the gift, the type of gift, and the connection between the giver
and the receiver. If you’re on the receiving end, it’s a good idea to refuse any item that’s overly
generous or given for the purpose of influencing a decision. Because accepting even small
gifts may violate company rules, always check on company policy.
JCPenney’s “Statement of Business Ethics,” for instance, states that employees can’t
accept any cash gifts or any noncash gifts except those that have a value below $50 and that
are generally used by the giver for promotional purposes. Employees can attend paid-for
business functions, but other forms of entertainment, such as sports events and golf outings,
can be accepted only if it’s practical for the Penney’s employee to reciprocate. Trips of several
days can’t be accepted under any circumstances.54

Whistle-Blowing
As we’ve seen, the misdeeds of Betty Vinson and her accomplices at WorldCom didn’t
go undetected. They caught the eye of Cynthia Cooper, the company’s director of internal
auditing. Cooper, of course, could have looked the other way, but instead she summoned up
the courage to be a whistle-blower—an individual who exposes illegal or unethical behavior in
an organization. Like Vinson, Cooper had majored in accounting at Mississippi State and was
a hard-working, dedicated employee. Unlike Vinson, however, she refused to be bullied by her
boss, CFO Scott Sullivan. In fact, she had tried to tell not only Sullivan but also auditors from

Chapter 3

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

63

the Arthur Andersen accounting firm that there was a problem with WorldCom’s books. The
auditors dismissed her warnings, and when Sullivan angrily told her to drop the matter, she
started cleaning out her office. But she didn’t relent. She and her team worked late each night,
conducting an extensive, secret investigation. Two months later, Cooper had evidence to take
to Sullivan, who told her once again to back off. Again, however, she stood up to him, and
though she regretted the consequences for her WorldCom coworkers, she reported the
scheme to the company’s board of directors. Within days, Sullivan was fired and the largest
accounting fraud in history became public.55
As a result of Cooper’s actions, executives came clean about the company’s financial
situation. The conspiracy of fraud was brought to an end, and though public disclosure of
WorldCom’s problems resulted in massive stock-price declines and employee layoffs, investor
and employee losses would have been greater without Cooper’s intervention. Even though
Cooper did the right thing, and landed on the cover of Time magazine for it, the experience
wasn’t exactly gratifying.
A lot of people applauded her action, but many coworkers shunned her; some even
blamed her for the company’s troubles.56
Whistle-blowing is sometimes career suicide. A survey of two hundred whistle-blowers
conducted by the National Whistleblower Center found that half were fired for blowing the
whistle.57 Even those who keep their jobs can experience repercussions. As long as they stay,
some will treat them (as one whistle-blower put it) “like skunks at a picnic”; if they leave, they
may be blackballed in the industry.58 On a positive note, new Federal laws have been passed
which are intended to protect whistle-blowers.
For her own part, Cynthia Cooper doesn’t regret what she did. As she told a group of
students at Mississippi State: “Strive to be persons of honor and integrity. Do not allow yourself
to be pressured. Do what you know is right even if there may be a price to be paid.”59 If your
company tells employees to do whatever it takes, push the envelope, look the other way, and
“be sure that we make our numbers,” you have three choices: go along with the policy, try to
change things, or leave. If your personal integrity is part of the equation, you’re probably down
to the last two choices.60

Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate social responsibility refers to the approach that an organization takes in
balancing its responsibilities toward different stakeholders when making legal, economic,
ethical, and social decisions. Remember that we previously defined stakeholders as those
with a legitimate interest in the success or failure of the business and the policies it adopts.
The term social responsibility refers to the approach that an organization takes in balancing its
responsibilities toward their various stakeholders.
What motivates companies to be “socially responsible”? We hope it’s because they
want to do the right thing, and for many companies, “doing the right thing” is a key motivator.
The fact is, it’s often hard to figure out what the “right thing” is: what’s “right” for one group of
stakeholders isn’t necessarily just as “right” for another. One thing, however, is certain:
companies today are held to higher standards than ever before. Consumers and other groups
consider not only the quality and price of a company’s products but also its character. If too
many groups see a company as a poor corporate citizen, it will have a harder time attracting
qualified employees, finding investors, and selling its products. Good corporate citizens, by
contrast, are more successful in all these areas.
Figure 3.3 presents a model of corporate responsibility based on a company’s
relationships with its stakeholders. In this model, the focus is on managers—not owners—as
the principals involved in these relationships. Owners are the stakeholders who invest risk
capital in the firm in expectation of a financial return. Other stakeholders include employees,
suppliers, and the communities in which the firm does business. Proponents of this model
hold that customers, who provide the firm with revenue, have a special claim on managers’
attention. The arrows indicate the two-way nature of corporation-stakeholder relationships: All
stakeholders have some claim on the firm’s resources and returns, and management’s job is to
make decisions that balance these claims.61

Let’s look at some of the ways in which companies can be “socially responsible” in
considering the claims of various stakeholders.
Figure 3.3: Management’s relationships with stakeholders

Owners
Owners invest money in companies. In return, the people who run a company have a
responsibility to increase the value of owners’ investments through profitable operations.
Managers also have a responsibility to provide owners (as well as other stakeholders having
financial interests, such as creditors and suppliers) with accurate, reliable information about
the performance of the business. Clearly, this is one of the areas in which WorldCom
managers fell down on the job. Upper-level management purposely deceived shareholders by
presenting them with fraudulent financial statements

Managers
Managers have what is known as a fiduciary responsibility to owners: they’re
responsible for safeguarding the company’s assets and handling its funds in a trustworthy
manner. Yet managers experience what is called the agency problem; a situation in which their
best interests do not align with those of the owners who employ them. To enforce managers’
fiduciary responsibilities for a firm’s financial statements and accounting records, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires CEOs and CFOs to attest to their accuracy. The law also
imposes penalties on corporate officers, auditors, board members, and any others who commit
fraud. You’ll learn more about this law in your accounting and business law courses.

Employees
Companies are responsible for providing employees with safe, healthy places to
work—as well as environments that are free from sexual harassment and all types of
discrimination. They should also offer appropriate wages and benefits. In the following
sections, we’ll take a closer look at these areas of corporate responsibility.

Wages and Benefits
At the very least, employers must obey laws governing minimum wage and overtime
pay. A minimum wage is set by the federal government, though states can set their own rates
as long as they are higher. The current federal rate, for example, is $7.25, while the rate in
many states is far higher.62 By law, employers must also provide certain benefits—social
security (retirement funds), unemployment insurance (protects against loss of income in case
of job loss), and workers’ compensation (covers lost wages and medical costs in case of onthe-job injury). Most large companies pay most of their workers more than minimum wage and
offer broader benefits, including medical, dental, and vision care, as well as savings programs,
in order to compete for talent.

Safety and Health
Though it seems obvious that companies should guard workers’ safety and health,
some simply don’t. For over four decades, for example, executives at Johns Manville
suppressed evidence that one of its products, asbestos, was responsible for the deadly lung
disease developed by many of its workers.63 The company concealed chest X- rays from
stricken workers, and executives decided that it was simply cheaper to pay workers’
compensation claims than to create a safer
work environment. A New Jersey court was
quite blunt in its judgment: Johns Manville, it

Figure 3.4: Workplace deaths by event or
exposure, 2014.

held, had made a deliberate, cold-blooded
decision to do nothing to protect at-risk
workers, in blatant disregard of their rights.64
About four in one hundred thousand
U.S. workers die in workplace “incidents” each
year. The Department of Labor categorizes
deaths caused by conditions like those at
Johns Manville as “exposure to harmful
substances or environments.” How prevalent
is this condition as a cause of workplace
deaths? See Figure 3.4, “Workplace Deaths
by Event or Exposure, 2014”, which breaks down workplace fatalities by cause. Some jobs are
more dangerous than others. For a comparative overview based on workplace deaths by
occupation, see Figure 3.5.
Fortunately for most people, things are far better than they were at Johns Manville.
Procter & Gamble (P&G), for example, considers the safety and health of its employees
paramount and promotes the attitude that “Nothing we do is worth getting hurt for.” With nearly
one hundred thousand employees worldwide, P&G uses a measure of worker safety called
“total incident rate per employee,” which records injuries resulting in loss of consciousness,
time lost from work, medical transfer to another job, motion restriction, or medical treatment
beyond first aid. The company attributes the low rate of such incidents—less than one incident
per hundred employees—to a variety of programs to promote workplace safety.65

Customers
The purpose of any business is to satisfy customers, who reward businesses by buying
their products. Sellers are also responsible—both ethically and legally—for treating customers
fairly. The rights of consumers were first articulated by President John F. Kennedy in 1962
when he submitted to Congress a presidential message devoted to consumer issues.66
Kennedy identified four consumer rights:
1) The right to safe products. A company should sell no product that it suspects of
being unsafe for buyers. Thus, producers have an obligation to safety-test products
before releasing them for public consumption. The automobile industry, for example,
conducts extensive safety testing before introducing new models (though recalls
remain common).
2) The right to be informed about a product. Sellers should furnish consumers with
the product information that they need to make an in- formed purchase decision.
That’s why pillows have labels identifying the materials used to make them, for
instance.
3) The right to choose what to buy. Consumers have a right to decide which
products to purchase, and sellers should let them know what their options are.
Pharmacists, for example, should tell patients when a prescription can be filled with
a cheaper brand-name or generic drug. Telephone companies should explain
alternative calling plans.

4) The right to be heard. Companies must tell customers how to contact them with
complaints or concerns. They should also listen and respond.
Companies share the responsibility for the legal and ethical treatment of consumers
with several government agencies: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces
consumer-protection laws; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees the
labeling of food products; and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which enforces
laws protecting consumers from the risk of product-related injury.

Communities
For obvious reasons, most communities see getting a new business as an asset and
view losing one—especially a large employer—as a detriment. After all, the economic impact
of business activities on local communities is substantial: They provide jobs, pay taxes, and
support local education, health, and recreation programs. Both big and small businesses
donate funds to community projects, encourage employees to volunteer their time, and donate
equipment and products for a variety of activities. Larger companies can make greater
financial contributions. Let’s start by taking a quick look at the philanthropic activities of a few
U.S. corporations.

Philanthropy
Many large corporations support various charities, an activity called philanthropy.
Some donate a percentage of sales or profits to worthwhile causes. Retailer Target, for
example, donates 5 percent of its profits—about $2 million per week—to schools,
neighborhoods, and local projects across the country; its store-based grants underwrite
programs in early childhood education, the arts, and family-violence prevention.67 The late
actor Paul Newman donated 100 percent of the profits from “Newman’s Own” foods (salad
dressing, pasta sauce, popcorn, and other products sold in eight countries). His company
continues his legacy of donating all profits and distributing them to thousands of organizations,
including the Hole in the Wall Gang camps for seriously ill children.68

Ethical Organizations
How Can You Recognize an Ethical Organization?
One goal of anyone engaged in business should be to foster ethical behavior in the
organizational environment. How do we know when an organization is behaving ethically?
Most lists of ethical organizational activities include the following criteria:

 Treating employees, customers, investors, and the public fairly
 Holding every member personally accountable for his or her action
 Communicating core values and principles to all members
 Demanding and rewarding integrity from all members in all situations69
Employees at companies that consistently make Business Ethics magazine’s list of the
“100 Best Corporate Citizens” regard the items on the previous list as business as usual in the
workplace. Companies at the top of the 2016 list include Microsoft, Hasbro, Ecolab, BristolMyers-Squibb, and Lockheed Martin.70
By contrast, employees with the following attitudes tend to suspect that their employers
aren’t as ethical as they should be:

 They consistently feel uneasy about the work they do.
 They object to the way they’re treated.
 They’re uncomfortable about the way coworkers are treated.
 They question the appropriateness of management directives and policies. 71
Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment occurs when an employee makes “unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature” to another
employee. It’s also considered sexual harassment when “submission to or rejection of this
conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual’s employment, unreasonably interferes with
an individual’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work
environment.”72

Chapter 3

71

To prevent sexual harassment—or at least minimize its likelihood—a company should
adopt a formal anti-harassment policy describing prohibited conduct, asserting its objections
to the behavior, and detailing penalties for violating the policy.73 Employers also have an
obligation to investigate harassment complaints. Failure to enforce anti-harassment policies
can be very costly. In 1998, for example, Mitsubishi paid $34 million to more than three
hundred fifty female employees of its Normal, Illinois, plant to settle a sexual harassment case
supported by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC reprimanded the
company for permitting an atmosphere of verbal and physical abuse against women, charging
that female workers had been subjected to various forms of harassment, ranging from
exposure to obscene graffiti and vulgar jokes to fondling and groping. 74

Workforce Diversity
In addition to complying with equal employment opportunity laws, many companies
make special efforts to recruit employees who are underrepresented in the workforce
according to sex, race, or some other characteristic. In helping to build more diverse
workforces, such initiatives contribute to competitive advantage for two reasons:
1) People from diverse backgrounds bring new talents and fresh perspectives to an
organization, typically enhancing creativity in the development of new products.
2) By more accurately reflecting the demographics of the marketplace, a diverse
workforce improves a company’s ability to serve an ethnically diverse population.

The Individual Approach to Ethics
Betty Vinson didn’t start out at WorldCom with the intention of going to jail. She
undoubtedly knew what the right behavior was, but the bottom line is that she didn’t do it. How
can you make sure that you do the right thing in the business world? How should you respond
to the kinds of challenges that you’ll be facing? Because your actions in the business world will
be strongly influenced by your moral character, let’s begin by assessing your current moral
condition. Which of the following best applies to you (select one)?
72

Chapter 3

1) I’m always ethical.
2) I’m mostly ethical.
3) I’m somewhat ethical.
4) I’m seldom ethical.
5) I’m never ethical.
Now that you’ve placed yourself in one of these categories, here are some general
observations. Few people put themselves below the second category. Most of us are ethical
most of the time, and most people assign themselves to category number two— “I’m mostly
ethical.” Why don’t more people claim that they’re always ethical?
Apparently, most people realize that being ethical all the time takes a great deal of
moral energy. If you placed yourself in category number two, ask yourself this question: How
can I change my behavior so that I can move up a notch? The answer to this question may be
simple. Just ask yourself an easier question: How would I like to be treated in a given
situation?75
Unfortunately, practicing this philosophy might be easier in your personal life than in the
business world. Ethical challenges arise in business because companies, especially large
ones, have multiple stakeholders who sometimes make competing demands. Making
decisions that affect multiple stakeholders isn’t easy even for seasoned managers; and for new
entrants to the business world, the task can be extremely daunting. You can, however, get a
head start in learning how to make ethical decisions by looking at two types of challenges that
you’ll encounter in the business world: ethical dilemmas and ethical decisions.

Addressing Ethical Dilemmas
An ethical dilemma is a morally problematic situation: you must choose between two or
more acceptable but often opposing alternatives that are important to different groups. Experts
often frame this type of situation as a “right-versus-right” decision. It’s the sort of decision that
Johnson & Johnson (known as J&J) CEO James Burke had to make in 1982.76 On September
30, twelve-year-old Mary Kellerman of Chicago died after her parents gave her Extra-Strength
Tylenol. That same morning, twenty-seven-year-old Adam Janus, also of Chicago, died after
taking Tylenol for minor chest pain. That night, when family members came to console his
parents, Adam’s brother and his wife took Tylenol from the same bottle and died within forty-

73

eight hours. Over the next two weeks, four more people in Chicago died after taking Tylenol.
The actual connection between Tylenol and the series of deaths wasn’t made until an off-duty
fireman realized from news reports that every victim had taken Tylenol. As consumers
panicked, J&J pulled Tylenol off Chicago-area retail shelves. Researchers discovered Tylenol
capsules containing large amounts of deadly cyanide. Because the poisoned bottles came
from batches originating at different J&J plants, investigators determined that the tampering
had occurred after the product had been shipped.77
So J&J wasn’t at fault. But CEO Burke was still faced with an extremely serious
dilemma: Was it possible to respond to the tampering cases without destroying the reputation
of a highly profitable brand?
Burke had two options:
1) He could recall only the lots of Extra-Strength Tylenol that were found to be tainted with
cyanide. In 1991, Perrier executives recalled only tainted product when they discovered
that cases of their bottled water had been poisoned with benzine. This option favored
J&J financially but possibly put more people at risk.
2) Burke could order a nationwide recall—of all bottles of Extra-Strength Tylenol. This
option would reverse the priority of the stakeholders, putting the safety of the public
above stakeholders’ financial interests.
Burke opted to recall all 31 million bottles of Extra-Strength Tylenol on the market. The
cost to J&J was $100 million, but public reaction was quite positive. Less than six weeks after
the crisis began, Tylenol capsules were reintroduced in new tamper-resistant bottles, and by
responding quickly and appropriately, J&J was eventually able to restore the Tylenol brand to
its previous market position. When Burke was applauded for moral courage, he replied that
he’d simply adhered to the long-standing J&J credo that put the interests of customers above
those of other stakeholders. His only regret was that the perpetrator was never caught. 78
If you’re wondering what your thought process should be if you’re confronted with an
ethical dilemma, you might wish to remember the mental steps listed here—which happen to
be the steps that James Burke took in addressing the Tylenol crisis:

1) Define the problem: How to respond to the tampering case without destroying the
reputation of the Tylenol brand.
2) Identify feasible options: (1) Recall only the lots of Tylenol that were found to be
tainted or (2) order a nationwide recall of all bottles of Extra-Strength Tylenol.
3) Assess the effect of each option on stakeholders: Option 1 (recalling only the
tainted lots of Tylenol) is cheaper but puts more
people at risk. Option 2 (recalling all bottles of Extra-

Figure 3.6: How to avoid an
ethical lapse: questions to ask

Strength Tylenol) puts the safety of the public above
stakeholders’ financial interests.
4) Establish criteria for determining the most
appropriate action: Adhere to the J&J credo, which
puts the interests of customers above those of other
stakeholders.
5) Select the best option based on the established
criteria: In 1982, Option 2 was selected, and a
nationwide recall of all bottles of Extra-Strength
Tylenol was conducted.

Making Ethical Decisions
In contrast to the “right-versus-right” problem posed by
an ethical dilemma, an ethical decision entails a “rightversus-wrong” decision—one in which there is clearly a right
(ethical) choice and a wrong (unethical or illegal) choice.
When you make a decision that’s unmistakably unethical or
illegal, you’ve committed an ethical lapse. If you’re presented
with this type of choice, asking yourself the questions in Figure
3.6 “How to Avoid an Ethical Lapse” will increase your odds of
making an ethical decision.

To test the validity of this approach, let’s take a point-by-point look at Betty
Vinson’s decisions:
1) Her actions were clearly illegal.
2) They were unfair to the workers who lost their jobs and to the investors who suffered
financial losses (and also to her family, who shared her public embarrassment).
3) She definitely felt badly about what she’d done.
4) She was embarrassed to tell other people what she had done.
5) Reports of her actions appeared in her local newspaper (and just about every other
newspaper in the country).
So Vinson could have answered “yes” to all five of our test questions. To simplify
matters, remember the following rule of thumb: If you answer yes to any one of these five
questions, odds are that you’re about to do something you shouldn’t.

Revisiting Johnson & Johnson
As discussed earlier, Johnson & Johnson received tremendous praise for the actions
taken by its CEO, James Burke, in response to the 1982 Tylenol catastrophe. However, things
change. To learn how a company can destroy its good reputation, let’s fast forward to 2008
and revisit J&J and its credo, which states, “We believe our first responsibility is to the doctors,
nurses and patients, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services.
In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality.” 79 How could a company
whose employees believed so strongly in its credo find itself under criminal and congressional
investigation for a series of recalls due to defective products?80 In a three-year period, the
company recalled twenty-four products, including Children’s, Infants’ and Adults’ Tylenol,
Motrin, and Benadryl;81 1-Day Acuvue TruEye contact lenses sold outside the U.S.;82 and hip
replacements.83
Unlike the Tylenol recall, no one had died from the defective products, but customers
were certainly upset to find they had purchased over-the-counter medicines for themselves
and their children that were potentially contaminated with dark particles or tiny specks of
metal;84 contact lenses that contained a type of acid that caused stinging or pain when inserted
in the eye;85 and defective hip implants that required patients to undergo a second hip
replacement.86

Who bears the responsibility for these image-damaging blunders? Two individuals who
were at least partially responsible were William Weldon, CEO, and Colleen Goggins,
Worldwide Chairman of J&J’s Consumer Group. Weldon has been criticized for being largely
invisible and publicly absent during the recalls.87 Additionally, he admitted that he did not
understand the consumer division where many of the quality control problems originated.88
Goggins was in charge of the factories that produced many of the recalled products. She was
heavily criticized by fellow employees for her excessive cost-cutting measures and her
propensity to replace experienced scientists with new hires.89 In addition, she was implicated in
scheme to avoid publically disclosing another J&J recall of a defective product.
After learning that J&J had released packets of Motrin that did not dissolve correctly, the
company hired contractors to go into convenience stores and secretly buy up every pack of
Motrin on the shelves. The instructions given to the contractors were the following: “You should
simply ‘act’ like a regular customer while making these purchases. THERE MUST BE NO
MENTION OF THIS BEING A RECALL OF THE PRODUCT!”90 In May 2010, when Goggins
appeared before a congressional committee investigating the “phantom recall,” she testified
that she was not aware of the behavior of the contractors91 and that she had “no knowledge of
instructions to contractors involved in the phantom recall to not tell store employees what they
were doing.” In her September 2010 testimony to the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform, she acknowledged that the company in fact wrote those very
instructions.

Refusing to Rationalize
Despite all the good arguments in favor of doing the right thing, why do many
reasonable people act unethically (at least at times)? Why do good people make bad choices?
According to one study, there are four common rationalizations (excuses) for justifying
misconduct:92
1) My behavior isn’t really illegal or immoral. Rationalizers try to convince
themselves that an action is OK if it isn’t downright illegal or blatantly immoral. They
tend to operate in a gray area where there’s no clear evidence that the action is
wrong.

Chapter 3

77

2) My action is in everyone’s best interests. Some rationalizers tell them- selves: “I
know I lied to make the deal, but it’ll bring in a lot of business and pay a lot of bills.”
They convince themselves that they’re expected to act in a certain way. 93
3) No one will find out what I’ve done. Here, the self-questioning comes down to “If I
didn’t get caught, did I really do it?” The answer is yes. There’s a simple way to
avoid succumbing to this rationalization: Always act as if you’re being watched.
4) The company will condone my action and protect me. This justification rests on
a fallacy. Betty Vinson may honestly have believed that her actions were for the
good of the company and that her boss would, therefore, accept full responsibility
(as he promised). When she goes to jail, however, she’ll go on her own.
Here’s another rule of thumb: If you find yourself having to

Figure 3.7

rationalize a decision, it’s probably a bad one.

What to Do When the Light Turns Yellow
Like our five questions, some ethical problems are fairly
straightforward. Others, unfortunately, are more complicated, but it
will help to think of our five-question test as a set of signals that will
warn you that you’re facing a particularly tough decision— that you
should think carefully about it and perhaps consult someone else.
The situation is like approaching a traffic light. Red and green lights
are easy; you know what they mean and exactly what to do. Yellow
lights are trickier. Before you decide which pedal to hit, try posing
our five questions. If you get a single yes, you’ll almost surely be
better off hitting the brake.94

Key Take-Aways
1)

Business ethics is the application of ethical behavior in a business
context. Ethical (trustworthy) companies are better able to attract and
keep customers, talented employees, and capital.

2)

Acting ethically in business means more than just obeying laws and
regulations. It also means being honest, doing no harm to others,
competing fairly, and declining to put your own interests above those
of your employer and coworkers.

3)

In the business world, you’ll encounter conflicts of interest: situations
in which you’ll have to choose between taking action that promotes
your personal interest and action that favors the interest of others.

4)

Corporate social responsibility refers to the approach that an
organization takes in balancing its responsibilities toward diﬀerent
stakeholders (owners, employees, customers, and the communities in
which they conduct business) when making legal, economic, ethical,
and social decisions.

5)

Managers have several responsibilities: to increase the value of
owners’ investments through proﬁtable operations, to provide owners
and other stakeholders with accurate, reliable ﬁnancial information,
and to safeguard the company’s assets and handle its funds in a
trustworthy manner.

Companies have a responsibility to pay appropriate wages and
beneﬁts, treat all workers fairly, and provide equal opportunities for all
employees. In addition, the must guard workers’ safety and health and
to provide them with a work environment that’s free from sexual
harassment.

7)

Consumers have certain legal rights: to use safe products, to be
informed about products, to choose what to buy, and to be heard.
Sellers must comply with these requirements.

8)

Businesspeople face two types of ethical challenges: ethical dilemmas
and ethical decisions.

9)

An ethical dilemma is a morally problematic situation in which you
must choose competing and often conflicting options which do not
satisfy all stakeholders.

10)

An ethical decision is one in which there’s a right (ethical) choice and
a wrong (unethical or downright illegal) choice.

Never before has business spanned the globe the way it does today. But why is
international business important? Why do companies and nations engage in international
trade? What strategies do they employ in the global marketplace? How do governments and
international agencies promote and regulate international trade? These questions and others
will be addressed in this chapter. Let’s start by looking at the more specific reasons why
companies and nations engage in international trade.

Why Do Nations Trade?
Why does the United States import automobiles, steel, digital phones, and apparel from
other countries? Why don’t we just make them ourselves? Why do other countries buy wheat,
chemicals, machinery, and consulting services from us? Because no national economy
produces all the goods and services that its people need. Countries are importers when they
buy goods and services from other countries; when they sell products to other nations, they’re
exporters. (We’ll discuss importing and exporting in greater detail later in the chapter.) The
monetary value of international trade is enormous. In 2010, the total value of worldwide trade
in merchandise and commercial services was $18.5 trillion.95

Absolute and Comparative Advantage
To understand why certain countries import or export certain products, you need to
realize that every country (or region) can’t produce the same products. The cost of labor, the
availability of natural resources, and the level of know-how vary greatly around the world. Most
economists use the concepts of absolute advantage and comparative advantage to explain
why countries import some products and export others.

Absolute Advantage
A nation has an absolute advantage if (1) it’s the only source of a particular product or
(2) it can make more of a product using fewer resources than other countries. Because of
climate and soil conditions, for example, France had an absolute advantage in wine making
until its dominance of worldwide wine production was challenged by the growing wine
industries in Italy, Spain, and the United States. Unless an absolute advantage is based on
some limited natural resource, it seldom lasts. That’s why there are few, if any, examples of
absolute advantage in the world today.

Comparative Advantage
How can we predict, for any given country, which products will be made and sold at
home, which will be imported, and which will be exported? This question can be answered by
looking at the concept of comparative advantage, which exists when a country can produce a
product at a lower opportunity cost compared to another nation. But what’s an opportunity
cost? Opportunity costs are the products that a country must forego making in order to
produce something else. When a country decides to specialize in a particular product, it must
sacrifice the production of another product. Countries benefit from specialization - focusing on
what they do best, and trading the output to other countries for what those countries do best.
The United States, for instance, is increasingly an exporter of knowledge-based products, such
as software, movies, music, and professional services (management consulting, financial
services, and so forth). America’s colleges and universities, therefore, are a source of
comparative advantage, and students from all over the world come to the United States for the
world’s best higher-education system.
France and Italy are centers for fashion and luxury goods and are leading exporters of
wine, perfume, and designer clothing. Japan’s engineering expertise has given it an edge in
such fields as automobiles and consumer electronics. And with large numbers of highly skilled
graduates in technology, India has become the world’s leader in low- cost, computer-software
engineering.

How Do We Measure Trade between Nations?
To evaluate the nature and consequences of its international trade, a nation looks at
two key indicators. We determine a country’s balance of trade by subtracting the value of its
imports from the value of its exports. If a country sells more products than it buys, it has a
favorable balance, called a trade surplus. If it buys more than it sells, it has an unfavorable
balance, or a trade deficit.
For many years, the United States has had a trade deficit: we buy far more goods from
the rest of the world than we sell overseas. This fact shouldn’t be surprising. With high income
levels, we not only consume a sizable portion of our own domestically produced goods but
enthusiastically buy imported goods. Other countries, such as China and Taiwan, which

Chapter 4

manufacture high volumes for export, have large trade surpluses because they sell far more
goods overseas than they buy.

Managing the National Credit Card
Are trade deficits a bad thing? Not necessarily. They can be positive if a country’s
economy is strong enough both to keep growing and to generate the jobs and incomes that
permit its citizens to buy the best the world has to offer. That was certainly the case in the
United States in the 1990s. Some experts, however, are alarmed at our trade deficit.
Investment guru Warren Buffet, for example, cautions that no country can continuously sustain
large and burgeoning trade deficits. Why not? Because creditor nations will eventually stop
taking IOUs from debtor nations, and when that happens, the national spending spree will
have to cease. “Our national credit card,” he warns, “allows us to charge truly breathtaking
amounts. But that card’s credit line is not limitless.”96
By the same token, trade surpluses aren’t necessarily good for a nation’s consumers.
Japan’s export-fueled economy produced high economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s. But
most domestically made consumer goods were priced at artificially high levels inside Japan
itself—so high, in fact, that many Japanese traveled overseas to buy the electronics and other
high-quality goods on which Japanese trade was dependent.
CD players and televisions were significantly cheaper in Honolulu or Los Angeles than
in Tokyo. How did this situation come about? Though Japan manufactures a variety of goods,
many of them are made for export. To secure shares in international markets, Japan prices its
exported goods competitively. Inside Japan, because competition is limited, producers can put
artificially high prices on Japanese-made goods. Due to a number of factors (high demand for
a limited supply of imported goods, high shipping and distribution costs, and other costs
incurred by importers in a nation that tends to protect its own industries), imported goods are
also expensive.97

Balance of Payments
The second key measure of the effectiveness of international trade is balance of
payments: the difference, over a period of time, between the total flow of money coming into a
country and the total flow of money going out. As in its balance of trade, the biggest factor in a
country’s balance of payments is the money that flows as a result of imports and exports. But
balance of payments includes other cash inflows and outflows, such as cash received from or
paid for foreign investment, loans, tourism, military expenditures, and foreign aid. For example,
if a U.S. company buys some real estate in a foreign country, that investment counts in the
U.S. balance of payments, but not in its balance of trade, which measures only import and
export transactions. In the long run, having an unfavorable balance of payments can negatively
affect the stability of a country’s currency. The United States has experienced unfavorable
balances of payments since the 1970s which has forced the government to cover its debt by
borrowing from other countries.98 Figure 4.2 provides a brief historical overview to illustrate the
relationship between the United States’ balance of trade and its balance of payments.

Payments (in millions of dollars), 1994–2014

Opportunities in International Business
The fact that nations exchange billions of dollars in goods and services each year
demonstrates that international trade makes good economic sense. For a company wishing to
expand beyond national borders, there are a variety of ways it can get involved in international
business. Let’s take a closer look at the more popular ones.

Importing and Exporting
Importing (buying products overseas and reselling them in one’s own country) and
exporting (selling domestic products to foreign customers) are the oldest and most prevalent
forms of international trade. For many companies, importing is the primary link to the global
market. American food and beverage wholesalers, for instance, import for resale in U.S.
supermarkets the bottled waters Evian and Fiji from their sources in the French Alps and the
Fiji Islands respectively.99 Other companies get into the global arena by identifying an
international market for their products and becoming exporters. The Chinese, for instance, are
fond of fast foods cooked in soybean oil. Because they also have an increasing appetite for
meat, they need high-protein soybeans to raise livestock.100 American farmers now export over
$9 billion worth of soybeans to China every year.101

Licensing and Franchising
A company that wants to get into an international market quickly while taking only
limited financial and legal risks might consider licensing agreements with foreign companies.
An international licensing agreement allows a foreign company (the licensee) to sell the
products of a producer (the licensor) or to use its intellectual property (such as patents,
trademarks, copyrights) in exchange for what is known as royalty fees. Here’s how it works:
You own a company in the United States that sells coffee-flavored popcorn. You’re sure that
your product would be a big hit in Japan, but you don’t have the resources to set up a factory
or sales office in that country. You can’t make the popcorn here and ship it to Japan because it
would get stale. So you enter into a licensing agreement with a Japanese company that allows
your licensee to manufacture coffee-flavored popcorn using your special process and to sell it

87

in Japan under your brand name. In exchange, the Japanese licensee would pay you a royalty
fee – perhaps a percentage of each sale or a
fixed amount per unit.

Figure 4.3: The first Burger King in Moscow

Another popular way to expand
overseas is to sell franchises. Under an
international franchise agreement, a
company (the franchiser) grants a foreign
company (the franchisee) the right to use its
brand name and to sell its products or
services. The franchisee is responsible for all
operations but agrees to operate according
to a business model established by the
franchiser. In turn, the franchiser usually
provides advertising, training, and new-product assistance. Franchising is a natural form of
global expansion for companies that operate domestically according to a franchise model,
including restaurant chains, such as McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken, and hotel
chains, such as Holiday Inn and Best Western.

Contract Manufacturing and Outsourcing
Because of high domestic labor costs, many U.S. companies manufacture their
products in countries where labor costs are lower. This arrangement is called international
contract manufacturing, a form of outsourcing. A U.S. company might contract with a local
company in a foreign country to manufacture one of its products. It will, however, retain control
of product design and development and put its own label on the finished product. Contract
manufacturing is quite common in the U.S. apparel business, with most American brands
being made in a number of Asian countries, including China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. 102
Thanks to twenty-first-century information technology, nonmanufacturing functions can
also be outsourced to nations with lower labor costs. U.S. companies increasingly draw on a
vast supply of relatively inexpensive skilled labor to perform various business services, such as
software development, accounting, and claims processing. For years, American insurance
companies have processed much of their claims-related paperwork in Ireland. With a large,

well-educated population with English language skills, India has become a center for software
development and customer-call centers for American companies. In the case of India, as you
can see in Figure 4.4, the attraction is not only a large pool of knowledge workers but also
significantly lower wages.

Strategic Alliances and Joint Ventures
What if a company wants to do business in a foreign country but lacks the expertise or
resources? Or what if the target nation’s government doesn’t allow foreign companies to
operate within its borders unless it has a local partner? In these cases, a firm might enter into a
strategic alliance with a local company or even with the government itself.
A strategic alliance is an agreement between two companies (or a company and a
nation) to pool resources in order to achieve business goals that benefit both partners. For
example, Viacom (a leading global media company) has a strategic alliance with Beijing
Television to produce Chinese-language music and entertainment programming.103
An alliance can serve a number of purposes:

 Enhancing marketing efforts
 Building sales and market share
 Improving products
 Reducing production and distribution costs
 Sharing technology

Alliances range in scope from informal cooperative agreements to joint ventures—
alliances in which the partners fund a separate entity (perhaps a partnership or a corporation)
to manage their joint operation. Magazine publisher Hearst, for example, has joint ventures
with companies in several countries. So, young women in Israel can read Cosmo Israel in
Hebrew, and Russian women can pick up a Russian-language version of Cosmo that meets
their needs. The U.S. edition serves as a starting point to which nationally appropriate material
is added in each different nation. This approach allows Hearst to sell the magazine in more
than fifty countries.104

Foreign Direct Investment and Subsidiaries
Many of the approaches to global expansion that we’ve discussed so far allow
companies to participate in international markets without investing in foreign plants and
facilities. As markets expand, however, a firm might decide to enhance its competitive
advantage by making a direct investment in operations conducted in another country. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) refers to the formal establishment of business operations on foreign
soil—the building of factories, sales offices, and distribution networks to serve local markets in
a nation other than the company’s home country. On the other hand, offshoring occurs when
the facilities set up in the foreign country replace U.S. manufacturing facilities and are used to
produce goods that will be sent back to the United States for sale. Shifting production to lowwage countries is often criticized as it results in the loss of jobs for U.S. workers. 105
FDI is generally the most expensive commitment that a firm can make to an overseas
market, and it’s typically driven by the size and attractiveness of the target market. For
example, German and Japanese automakers, such as BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, and Honda,
have made serious commitments to the U.S. market: most of the cars and trucks that they
build in plants in the South and Midwest are destined for sale in the United States.

A common form of FDI is the foreign subsidiary: an independent company owned by a
foreign firm (called the parent). This approach to going international not only gives the parent
company full access to local markets but also exempts it from any laws or regulations that may
hamper the activities of foreign firms. The parent company has tight control over the operations
of a subsidiary, but while senior managers from the parent company often oversee operations,
many managers and employees are citizens of the host country. Not surprisingly, most very
Figure 4.5: Where FDI Goes

large firms have foreign subsidiaries. IBM and Coca-Cola, for example, have both had success
in the Japanese market through their foreign subsidiaries (IBM-Japan and Coca-Cola–Japan).
FDI goes in the other direction, too, and many companies operating in the United States are in
fact subsidiaries of foreign firms. Gerber Products, for example, is a subsidiary of the Swiss
company Novartis, while Stop & Shop and Giant Food Stores belong to the Dutch company
Royal Ahold. Where does most FDI capital end up? Figure 4.5 provides an overview of
amounts, destinations (high to low income countries), and trends.
All these strategies have been employed successfully in global business. But success in
international business involves more than finding the best way to reach international markets.
Global business is a complex, risky endeavor. Over time, many large companies reach the
point of becoming truly multi-national.

Multinational Corporations
A company that operates in many countries is called a multinational corporation
(MNC). Fortune magazine’s roster of the top 500 MNCs speaks for the growth of non-U.S.
businesses. Only two of the top ten MNCs are headquartered in the U.S.(see Figure 4.6
above): Wal-Mart (number 1) and Exxon (number 5). Three others are in the top 15: Chevron,
Berkshire Hathaway, and Apple. The others are non-U.S. firms. Interestingly, of the fifteen top
companies, ten are energy suppliers, two are motor vehicle companies, and two are consumer

Chapter 4

electronics or computer companies. Also interesting is the difference between company
revenues and profits: the list would look quite different arranged by profits instead of revenues!
MNCs often adopt the approach encapsulated in the motto “Think globally, act locally.”
They often adjust their operations, products, marketing, and distribution to mesh with the
environments of the countries in which they operate. Because they understand that a “onesize-fits-all” mentality doesn’t make good business sense when they’re trying to sell products in
different markets, they’re willing to accommodate cultural and economic differences.
Increasingly, MNCs supplement their mainstream product line with products designed for local
markets. Coca-Cola, for example, produces coffee and citrus-juice drinks developed
specifically for the Japanese market.106 When Nokia and Motorola design cell phones, they’re
often geared to local tastes in color, size, and other features. For example, Nokia introduced a
cell phone for the rural Indian consumer that has a dust-resistant keypad, anti-slip grip, and a
built-in flashlight.107 McDonald’s provides a vegetarian menu in India, where religious
convictions affect the demand for beef and pork.108 In Germany, McDonald’s caters to local
tastes by offering beer in some restaurants and a Shrimp Burger in Hong Kong and Japan.109
Likewise, many MNCs have made themselves more sensitive to local market conditions
by decentralizing their decision making. While corporate headquarters still maintain a fair
amount of control, home-country managers keep a suitable distance by relying on modern
telecommunications. Today, fewer managers are dispatched from headquarters; MNCs
depend instead on local talent. Not only does decentralized organization speed up and
improve decision making, but it also allows an MNC to project the image of a local company.
IBM, for instance, has been quite successful in the Japanese market because local customers
and suppliers perceive it as a Japanese company. Crucial to this perception is the fact that the
vast majority of IBM’s Tokyo employees, including top leadership, are Japanese nationals.110

Criticism of MNC’s
The global reach of MNCs is a source of criticism as well as praise. Critics argue that
they often destroy the livelihoods of home-country workers by moving jobs to developing
countries where workers are willing to labor under poor conditions and for less pay. They also
contend that traditional lifestyles and values are being weakened, and even destroyed, as
global brands foster a global culture of American movies; fast food; and cheap, mass-produced

93

consumer products. Still others claim that the demand of MNCs for constant economic growth
and cheaper access to natural resources do irreversible damage to the physical environment.
All these negative consequences, critics maintain, stem from the abuses of international
trade—from the policy of placing profits above people, on a global scale. These views surfaced
in violent street demonstrations in Seattle in 1999 and Genoa, Italy, in 2000, and since then,
meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have regularly been
assailed by protestors.

In Defense of MNC’s
Supporters of MNCs respond that huge corporations deliver better, cheaper products for
customers everywhere; create jobs; and raise the standard of living in developing countries.
They also argue that globalization increases cross-cultural understanding. Anne O. Kruger,
first deputy managing director of the IMF, says the following:
“The impact of the faster growth on living standards has been phenomenal. We
have observed the increased well-being of a larger percentage of the world’s
population by a greater increment than ever before in history. Growing incomes
give people the ability to spend on things other than basic food and shelter, in
particular on things such as education and health. This ability, combined with the
sharing among nations of medical and scientific advances, has transformed life in
many parts of the developing world.
Infant mortality has declined from 180 per 1,000 births in 1950 to 60 per 1,000
births. Literacy rates have risen from an average of 40 percent in the 1950s to
over 70 percent today. World poverty has declined, despite still-high population
growth in the developing world.”111

The Global Business Environment
In the classic movie The Wizard of Oz, a magically misplaced Midwest farm girl takes a
moment to survey the bizarre landscape of Oz and then comments to her little dog, “I don’t
think we’re in Kansas anymore, Toto.” That sentiment probably echoes the reaction of many
businesspeople who find themselves in the midst of international ventures for the first time.
The differences between the foreign landscape and the one with which they’re familiar are

often huge and multifaceted. Some are quite obvious, such as differences in language,
currency, and everyday habits (say, using chopsticks instead of silverware). But others are
subtle, complex, and sometimes even hidden.
Success in international business means understanding a wide range of cultural,
economic, legal, and political differences between countries. Let’s look at some of the more
important of these differences.

The Cultural Environment
Even when two people from the same country communicate, there’s always a possibility
of misunderstanding. When people from different countries get together, that possibility
increases substantially. Differences in communication styles reflect differences in culture: the
system of shared beliefs, values, customs, and behaviors that govern the interactions of
members of a society. Cultural differences create challenges to successful international
business dealings. Let’s look at a few of these challenges.

Language
English is the international language of business. The natives of such European
countries as France and Spain certainly take pride in their own languages and cultures, but
nevertheless English is the business language of the European community.
Whereas only a few educated Europeans have studied Italian or Norwegian, most have
studied English. Similarly, on the South Asian subcontinent, where hundreds of local
languages and dialects are spoken, English is the official language. In most corners of the
world, English-only speakers—such as most Americans—have no problem finding competent
translators and interpreters. So why is language an issue for English speakers doing business
in the global marketplace? In many countries, only members of the educated classes speak
English. The larger population—which is usually the market you want to tap—speaks the local
tongue. Advertising messages and sales appeals must take this fact into account. More than
one English translation of an advertising slogan has resulted in a humorous (and perhaps
serious) blunder. Some classics are listed on the next page in Figure 4.7.

Furthermore, relying on translators and interpreters puts you as an international
businessperson at a disadvantage. You’re privy only to interpretations of the messages that
you’re getting, and this handicap can result in a real competitive problem. Maybe you’ll
misread the subtler intentions of the person with whom you’re trying to conduct business. The
best way to combat this problem is to study foreign languages. Most people appreciate some
effort to communicate in their local language, even on the most basic level. They even
appreciate mistakes you make resulting from a desire to demonstrate your genuine interest in
the language of your counterparts in foreign countries. The same principle goes doubly when
you’re introducing yourself to non- English speakers in the United States. Few things work

faster to encourage a friendly atmosphere than a native speaker’s willingness to greet a
foreign guest in the guest’s native language.

Time and Sociability
Americans take for granted many of the cultural aspects of our business practices. Most
of our meetings, for instance, focus on business issues, and we tend to start and end our
meetings on schedule. These habits stem from a broader cultural preference: we don’t like to
waste time. (It was an American, Benjamin Franklin, who coined the phrase “Time is money.”)
This preference, however, is by no means universal. The expectation that meetings will start
on time and adhere to precise agendas is common in parts of Europe (especially the Germanic
countries), as well as in the United States, but elsewhere—say, in Latin America and the
Middle East—people are often late to meetings.

High- and Low-Context Cultures
Likewise, don’t expect businesspeople from these regions—or businesspeople from
most of Mediterranean Europe, for that matter—to “get down to business” as soon as a
meeting has started. They’ll probably ask about your health and that of your family, inquire
whether you’re enjoying your visit to their country, suggest local foods, and generally appear to
be avoiding serious discussion at all costs. For Americans, such topics are conducive to
nothing but idle chitchat, but in certain cultures, getting started this way is a matter of simple
politeness and hospitality.

Intercultural Communication
Different cultures have different communication styles—a fact that can take some
getting used to. For example, degrees of animation in expression can vary from culture to
culture. Southern Europeans and Middle Easterners are quite animated, favoring expressive
body language along with hand gestures and raised voices. Northern Europeans are far more
reserved. The English, for example, are famous for their understated style and the Germans
for their formality in most business settings. In addition, the distance at which one feels
comfortable when talking with someone varies by culture. People from the Middle East like to
converse from a distance of a foot or less, while Americans prefer more personal space.
Finally, while people in some cultures prefer to deliver direct, clear messages, others
use language that’s subtler or more indirect. North Americans and most Northern Europeans

fall into the former category and many Asians into the latter. But even within these categories,
there are differences. Though typically polite, Chinese and Koreans are extremely direct in
expression, while Japanese are indirect: They use vague language and avoid saying “no” even
if they do not intend to do what you ask. They worry that turning someone down will result in
their “losing face”, i.e., an embarrassment or loss of credibility, and so they avoid doing this in
public.
In summary, learn about a country’s culture and use your knowledge to help improve
the quality of your business dealings. Learn to value the subtle differences among cultures, but
don’t allow cultural stereotypes to dictate how you interact with people from any culture. Treat
each person as an individual and spend time getting to know what he or she is about.

The Economic Environment
If you plan to do business in a foreign country, you need to know its level of economic
development. You also should be aware of factors influencing the value of its currency and the
impact that changes in that value will have on your profits.

Economic Development
If you don’t understand a nation’s level of economic development, you’ll have trouble
answering some basic questions, such as: Will consumers in this country be able to afford the
product I want to sell? Will it be possible to make a reasonable profit? A country’s level of
economic development can be evaluated by estimating the annual income earned per citizen.
The World Bank, which lends money for improvements in underdeveloped nations, divides
countries into four income categories:
World Bank Country and Lending Groups (by Gross National Income per Capita
2015)

112

 High income—$12,736 or higher (United States, Germany, Japan)
 Upper-middle income—$4,126 to $12,735 (China, South Africa, Mexico)
 Lower-middle income—$1,046 to $4,125 (Kenya, Philippines, India)
 Low income—$1,045 or less (Afghanistan, South Sudan, Haiti)
Note that that even though a country has a low annual income per citizen, it can still be
an attractive place for doing business. India, for example, is a lower-middle-income country,

yet it has a population of a billion, and a segment of that population is well educated—an
appealing feature for many business initiatives.
The long-term goal of many countries is to move up the economic development ladder.
Some factors conducive to economic growth include a reliable banking system, a strong stock
market, and government policies to encourage investment and competition while discouraging
corruption. It’s also important that a country have a strong infrastructure—its systems of
communications (telephone, Internet, television, newspapers), transportation (roads, railways,
airports), energy (gas and electricity, power plants), and social facilities (schools, hospitals).
These basic systems will help countries attract foreign investors, which can be crucial to
economic development.

Currency Valuations and Exchange Rates
If every nation used the same currency, international trade and travel would be a lot
easier. Of course, this is not the case. There are around 175 currencies in the world: Some
you’ve heard of, such as the British pound; others are likely unknown to you, such as the
manat, the official currency of Azerbaijan. If you were in Azerbaijan you would exchange your
U.S. dollars for Azerbaijan manats. The day’s foreign exchange rate will tell you how much one
currency is worth relative to another currency and so determine how many manats you will
receive. If you have traveled abroad, you already have personal experience with the impact of
exchange rate movements.

The Legal and Regulatory Environment
One of the more difficult aspects of doing business globally is dealing with vast
differences in legal and regulatory environments. The United States, for example, has an
established set of laws and regulations that provide direction to businesses operating within its
borders. But because there is no global legal system, key areas of business law—for example,
contract provisions and copyright protection—can be treated in different ways in different
countries. Companies doing international business often face many inconsistent laws and
regulations. To navigate this sea of confusion, American businesspeople must know and follow
both U.S. laws and regulations and those of nations in which they operate.

of bribes and other favors in the conduct of business.
Unfortunately, though they’re illegal in this country,
such tactics as kickbacks and bribes are businessas-usual in many nations. According to some

giving bribes or undercover payments to foreign
officials or business people who expect them. In
theory, because the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

warns foreigners that Americans can’t give bribes, they’ll eventually stop expecting them.
Where are American businesspeople most likely and least likely to encounter bribe
requests and related forms of corruption? Transparency International, an independent
German-based organization, annually rates nations according to “perceived corruption,” (see
Figure 4.8) which it defines as “the abuse of entrusted power for private gain.”114

Case Study: Economic and International
Impact of the U.S. Hospitality & Tourism
According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, the travel and
tourism industry in the United States generated $1.6 trillion in economic output
and 7.8 million U.S. jobs in 2013, with nearly one in 18 Americans employed
directly or indirectly in a travel or tourism-related industry.115 The Bureau of Labor
of Labor Statistics indicates that an even higher percentage (11%) of U.S. jobs
are in the Leisure and Hospitality sector.116
While the majority of travel, tourism and hospitality in the U.S. tourism
industry is domestic, the U.S. leads the world in international travel and tourism
exports (i.e., travelers from other countries visiting the U.S.) with 15% of global
traveler spending. Travel and tourism ranks as the top services export,
accounting for 31 percent of all U.S. services exports in 2014.
Expenditures by international visitors in the United Sates translate to
economic impacts and jobs: including: $220.8 billion in sales, a $75.1 billion trade
surplus, and 1.1 million total jobs in 2014.117 The sector is poised to grow: the
latest U.S. Commerce Department international travel forecast estimates a 20%
increase in international visitors in 2020 in comparison to 2014. 118

Trade Controls
The debate about the extent to which countries should control the flow of foreign goods
and investments across their borders is as old as international trade itself. Governments
continue to control trade. To better understand how and why, let’s examine a hypothetical
case. Suppose you’re in charge of a small country in which people do two things—grow food
and make clothes. Because the quality of both products is high and the prices are reasonable,
your consumers are happy to buy locally made food and clothes. But one day, a farmer from a
nearby country crosses your border with several wagonloads of wheat to sell. On the same
day, a foreign clothes maker arrives with a large shipment of clothes. These two entrepreneurs
want to sell food and clothes in your country at prices below those that local consumers now
pay for domestically made food and clothes. At first, this seems like a good deal for your
consumers: they won’t have to pay as much for food and clothes. But then you remember all
102

the people in your country who grow food and make clothes. If no one buys their goods
(because the imported goods are cheaper), what will happen to their livelihoods? And if many
people become unemployed, what will happen to your national economy? That’s when you
decide to protect your farmers and clothes makers by setting up trade rules. Maybe you’ll
increase the prices of imported goods by adding a tax to them; you might even make the tax
so high that they’re more expensive than your homemade goods. Or perhaps you’ll help your
farmers grow food more cheaply by giving them financial help to defray their costs. The
government payments that you give to the farmers to help offset some of their costs of
production are called subsidies. These subsidies will allow the farmers to lower the price of
their goods to a point below that of imported competitors’ goods. What’s even better is that the
lower costs will allow the farmers to export their own goods at attractive, competitive prices.
The United States has a long history of subsidizing farmers. Subsidy programs
guarantee farmers (including large corporate farms) a certain price for their crops, regardless
of the market price. This guarantee ensures stable income in the farming community but can
have a negative impact on the world economy. How? Critics argue that in allowing American
farmers to export crops at artificially low prices, U.S. agricultural subsidies permit them to
compete unfairly with farmers in developing countries. A reverse situation occurs in the steel
industry, in which a number of countries—China, Japan, Russia, Germany, and Brazil—
subsidize domestic producers.
U.S. trade unions charge that this practice gives an unfair advantage to foreign
producers and hurts the American steel industry, which can’t compete on price with subsidized
imports.
Whether they push up the price of imports or push down the price of local goods, such
initiatives will help locally produced goods compete more favorably with foreign goods. Both
strategies are forms of trade controls—policies that restrict free trade. Because they protect
domestic industries by reducing foreign competition, the use of such controls is often called
protectionism. Though there’s considerable debate over the pros and cons of this practice, all
countries engage in it to some extent. Before debating the issue, however, let’s learn about the
more common types of trade restrictions: tariffs, quotas, and, embargoes.

Tariffs
Tariffs are taxes on imports. Because they raise the price of the foreign-made goods,
they make them less competitive. The United States, for example, protects domestic makers of
synthetic knitted shirts by imposing a stiff tariff of 32.5 percent on imports.119 Tariffs are also
used to raise revenue for a government. Shoe imports alone are worth $2.7 billion annually to
the federal government.120

Quotas
A quota imposes limits on the quantity of a good that can be imported over a period of
time. Quotas are used to protect specific industries, usually new industries or those facing
strong competitive pressure from foreign firms. U.S. import quotas take two forms. An absolute
quota fixes an upper limit on the amount of a good that can be imported during the given
period. A tariff-rate quota permits the import of a specified quantity and then adds a high import
tax once the limit is reached.
Sometimes quotas protect one group at the expense of another. To protect sugar beet
and sugar cane growers, for instance, the United States imposes a tariff-rate quota on the
importation of sugar—a policy that has driven up the cost of sugar to two to three times world
prices.121 These artificially high prices push up costs for American candy makers, some of
whom have moved their operations elsewhere, taking high-paying manufacturing jobs with
them. Life Savers, for example, were made in the United States for ninety years but are now
produced in Canada, where the company saves $9 million annually on the cost of sugar. 122
An extreme form of quota is the embargo, which, for economic or political reasons,
bans the import or export of certain goods to or from a specific country. The U. S., for example,
bans nearly every commodity originating in Cuba, although this may soon change.

Dumping
A common political rationale for establishing tariffs and quotas is the need to combat
dumping: the practice of selling exported goods below the price that producers would normally
charge in their home markets (and often below the cost of producing the goods). Usually,
nations resort to this practice to gain entry and market share in foreign markets, but it can also
be used to sell off surplus or obsolete goods. Dumping creates unfair competition for domestic

Chapter 4

industries, and governments are justifiably concerned when they suspect foreign countries of
dumping products on their markets. They often retaliate by imposing punitive tariffs that drive
up the price of the imported goods.

The Pros and Cons of Trade Controls
Opinions vary on government involvement in international trade. Proponents of controls
contend that there are a number of legitimate reasons why countries engage in protectionism.
Sometimes they restrict trade to protect specific industries and their workers from foreign
competition—agriculture, for example, or steel making. At other times, they restrict imports to
give new or struggling industries a chance to get established. Finally, some countries use
protectionism to shield industries that are vital to their national defense, such as shipbuilding
and military hardware.
Despite valid arguments made by supporters of trade controls, most experts believe that
such restrictions as tariffs and quotas—as well as practices that don’t promote level playing
fields, such as subsidies and dumping—are detrimental to the world economy. Without
impediments to trade, countries can compete freely. Each nation can focus on what it does
best and bring its goods to a fair and open world market. When this happens, the world will
prosper, or so the argument goes. International trade is certainly heading in the direction of
unrestricted markets.

Reducing International Trade Barriers
A number of organizations work to ease barriers to trade, and more countries are joining
together to promote trade and mutual economic benefits. Let’s look at some of these important
initiatives.

Trade Agreements and Organizations
Free trade is encouraged by a number of agreements and organizations set up to
monitor trade policies. The two most important are the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade and the World Trade Organization.

Chapter 4

105

General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
After the Great Depression and World War II, most countries focused on protecting
home industries, so international trade was hindered by rigid trade restrictions. To rectify this
situation, twenty-three nations joined together in 1947 and signed the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which encouraged free trade by regulating and reducing tariffs and
by providing a forum for resolving trade disputes.
The highly successful initiative achieved substantial reductions in tariffs and quotas, and
in 1995 its members founded the World Trade Organization to continue the work of GATT in
overseeing global trade.

World Trade Organization
Based in Geneva, Switzerland, with nearly 150 members, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) encourages global commerce and lower trade barriers, enforces
international rules of trade, and provides a forum for resolving disputes. It is empowered, for
instance, to determine whether a member nation’s trade policies have violated the
organization’s rules, and it can direct “guilty” countries to remove disputed barriers (though it
has no legal power to force any country to do anything it doesn’t want to do). If the guilty party
refuses to comply, the WTO may authorize the plaintiff nation to erect trade barriers of its own,
generally in the form of tariffs.
Affected members aren’t always happy with WTO actions. In 2002, for example, the
Bush administration imposed a three-year tariff on imported steel. In ruling against this tariff,
the WTO allowed the aggrieved nations to impose counter-tariffs on some politically sensitive
American products, such as Florida oranges, Texas grapefruits and computers, and Wisconsin
cheese. Reluctantly, the administration lifted its tariff on steel.123

Financial Support for Emerging Economies: The IMF and the World Bank
A key to helping developing countries become active participants in the global
marketplace is providing financial assistance. Offering monetary assistance to some of the
poorest nations in the world is the shared goal of two organizations: the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. These organizations, to which most countries belong, were
established in 1944 to accomplish different but complementary purposes.

The International Monetary Fund
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans money to countries with troubled
economies, such as Mexico in the 1980s and mid-1990s and Russia and Argentina in the late
1990s. There are, however, strings attached to IMF loans: in exchange for relief in times of
financial crisis, borrower countries must institute sometimes painful financial and economic
reforms. In the 1980s, for example, Mexico received financial relief from the IMF on the
condition that it privatize and deregulate certain industries and liberalize trade policies. The
government was also required to cut back expenditures for such services as education, health
care, and workers’ benefits.124

The World Bank
The World Bank is an important source of economic assistance for poor and
developing countries. With backing from wealthy donor countries (such as the United States,
Japan, Germany, and United Kingdom), the World Bank has committed $42.5 billion in loans,
grants, and guarantees to some of the world’s poorest nations.125 Loans are made to help
countries improve the lives of the poor through community-support programs designed to
provide health, nutrition, education, infrastructure, and other social services.

Trading Blocs: NAFTA and the European Union
So far, our discussion has suggested that global trade would be strengthened if there
were no restrictions on it—if countries didn’t put up barriers to trade or perform special favors
for domestic industries. The complete absence of barriers is an ideal state of affairs that we
haven’t yet attained. In the meantime, economists and policymakers tend to focus on a more
practical question: Can we achieve the goal of free trade on the regional level? To an extent,
the answer is yes. In certain parts of the world, groups of countries have joined together to
allow goods and services to flow without restrictions across their mutual borders. Such groups
are called trading blocs. Let’s examine two of the most powerful trading blocs—NAFTA and
the European Union.

North American Free Trade Association
The North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) is an agreement among the
governments of the United States, Canada, and Mexico to open their borders to unrestricted

107

trade. The effect of this agreement is that three very different economies are combined into
one economic zone with almost no trade barriers. From the northern tip of Canada to the
southern tip of Mexico, each country benefits from the comparative advantages of its partners:
each nation is free to produce what it does best and to trade its goods and services without
restrictions.
When the agreement was ratified in 1994, it had no shortage of skeptics. Many people
feared, for example, that without tariffs on Mexican goods, more U.S. manufacturing jobs
would be lost to Mexico, where labor is cheaper. Almost two decades later, most such fears
have not been realized, and, by and large, NAFTA has been a success.
Since it went into effect, the value of trade between the United States and Mexico has
grown substantially, and Canada and Mexico are now the United States’ top trading partners.

The European Union
The forty-plus countries of Europe have long shown an interest in integrating their
economies. The first organized effort to integrate a segment of Europe’s economic entities
began in the late 1950s, when six countries joined together to form the European Economic
Community (EEC). Over the next four decades, membership grew, and in the late 1990s, the
EEC became the European Union. Today, the European Union (EU) is a group of twentyseven countries that have eliminated trade barriers among themselves (see the map in Figure
4.10).
At first glance, the EU looks similar to NAFTA. Both, for instance, allow unrestricted
trade among member nations. But the provisions of the EU go beyond those of NAFTA in
several important ways. Most importantly, the EU is more than a trading organization: it also
enhances political and social cooperation and binds its members into a single entity with
authority to require them to follow common rules and regulations. It is much like a federation of
states with a weak central government, with the effect not only of eliminating internal barriers
but also of enforcing common tariffs on trade from outside the EU. In addition, while NAFTA
allows goods and services as well as capital to pass between borders, the EU also allows
people to come and go freely: if you possess an EU passport, you can work in any EU nation.

Figure 4.10: The European Union

The Euro
A key step toward unification occurred in 1999, when most (but not all) EU members
agreed to abandon their own currencies and adopt a joint currency. The actual conversion
occurred in 2002, when a common currency called the euro replaced the separate currencies
of participating EU countries. The common currency facilitates trade and finance because
exchange-rate differences no longer complicate transactions.126
Its proponents argued that the EU would not only unite economically and politically
distinct countries but also create an economic power that could compete against the dominant
players in the global marketplace. Individually, each European country has limited economic
power, but as a group, they could be an economic superpower.127 Over time, the value of the
euro has been questioned. Many of the “euro” countries (Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and
Ireland in particular) have been financially irresponsible, piling up huge debts and experiencing
high unemployment and problems in the housing market. But because these troubled countries
share a common currency with the other “euro countries”, they are less able to correct their

economic woes.128 Many economists fear that the financial crisis precipitated by these
financially irresponsible countries threaten the very survival of the euro.129 Keep a close eye on
Greece because if an exit from the Euro occurs, it will likely start there.
Only time will tell whether the trend toward regional trade agreements is good for the
world economy. Clearly, they’re beneficial to their respective participants; for one thing, they
get preferential treatment from other members. But certain questions still need to be answered
more fully. Are regional agreements, for example, moving the world closer to free trade on a
global scale—toward a marketplace in which goods and services can be traded anywhere
without barriers?

Key Takeaways
1)

Nations trade because they don’t produce all the products that their
inhabitants need.

2)

The cost of labor, the availability of natural resources, and the level of
know-how vary greatly around the world, so not every country has the same
resources or is good at producing the same products.

3)

To explain how countries decide what products to import and export,
economists use the concepts of absolute and comparative advantage: A
nation has an absolute advantage if it’s the only source of a particular
product or can make more of a product with the same amount of or fewer
resources than other countries. A comparative advantage exists when a
country can produce a product at a lower opportunity cost than other
nations.

4)

We determine a country’s balance of trade by subtracting the value of its
imports from the value of its exports. If a country sells more products than it
buys, it has a favorable balance, called a trade surplus. If it buys more
than it sells, it has an unfavorable balance, or a trade deficit.

5)

The balance of payments is the difference, over a period of time, between
the total flow coming into a country and the total flow going out. The biggest
factor in a country’s balance of payments is the money that comes in and
goes out as a result of exports and imports.

A company that operates in many countries is called a multinational
corporation (MNC).

7)

For a company in the United States wishing to expand beyond national
borders, there are a variety of ways to get involved in international
business:
a) Importing involves purchasing products from other countries and
reselling them in one’s own.
b) Exporting entails selling products to foreign customers
c) Under a franchise agreement, a company grants a foreign company the
right to use its brand name and sell its products.
d) A licensing agreement allows a foreign company to sell a company’s
products or use its intellectual property in exchange for royalty fees.
e) Through international contract manufacturing, or outsourcing, a
company has its products manufactured or services provided in other
countries.
f) A joint venture is a type of strategic alliance in which a separate entity
funded by the participating companies is formed.
g) Foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to the formal establishment of
business operations on foreign soil.
h) A common form of FDI is the foreign subsidiary, an independent
company owned by a foreign firm.

The Ice Cream Men
Who would have thought it? Two ex-hippies with strong interests in social activism
would end up starting one of the best-known ice cream companies in the country—Ben &
Jerry’s. Perhaps it was meant to be. Ben Cohen (the
“Ben” of Ben & Jerry’s) always had a fascination with

Figure 5.1: Ben Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield in 2010.

ice cream. As a child, he made his own mixtures by
smashing his favorite cookies and candies into his ice
cream. But it wasn’t until his senior year in high school
that he became an official “ice cream man,” happily
driving his truck through neighborhoods filled with kids
eager to buy his ice cream pops. After high school, Ben
tried college but it wasn’t for him. He attended Colgate
University for a year and a half before he dropped out to return to his real love: being an ice
cream man. He tried college again—this time at Skidmore, where he studied pottery and
jewelry making—but, in spite of his selection of courses, still didn’t like it.
In the meantime, Jerry Greenfield (the “Jerry” of Ben & Jerry’s) was following a similar
path. He majored in pre-med at Oberlin College in the hopes of one day becoming a doctor.
But he had to give up on this goal when he was not accepted into medical school. On a
positive note, though, his college education steered him into a more lucrative field: the world of
ice cream making. He got his first peek at the ice cream industry when he worked as a scooper
in the student cafeteria at Oberlin. So, fourteen years after they first met on the junior high
school track team, Ben and Jerry reunited and decided to go into ice cream making big time.
They moved to Burlington, Vermont—a college town in need of an ice cream parlor—and
completed a $5 correspondence course from Penn State on making ice cream. After getting an
A in the course—not surprising, given that the tests were open book—they took the plunge:
with their life savings of $8,000 and $4,000 of borrowed funds they set up an ice cream shop in
a made-over gas station on a busy street corner in Burlington.130 The next big decision was
which form of business ownership was best for them. This chapter introduces you to their
options.

Factors to Consider
If you’re starting a new business, you have to decide which legal form of ownership is
best for you and your business. Do you want to own the business yourself and operate as a
sole proprietorship? Or, do you want to share ownership, operating as a partnership or a
corporation? Before we discuss the pros and cons of these three types of ownership, let’s
address some of the questions that you’d probably ask yourself in choosing the appropriate
legal form for your business.
1) In setting up your business, do you want to minimize the costs of getting started? Do
you hope to avoid complex government regulations and reporting requirements?
2) How much control would you like? How much responsibility for running the business are
you willing to share? What about sharing the profits?
3) Do you want to avoid special taxes?
4) Do you have all the skills needed to run the business?
5) Are you likely to get along with your co-owners over an extended period of time?
6) Is it important to you that the business survive you?
7) What are your financing needs and how do you plan to finance your company?
8) How much personal exposure to liability are you willing to accept? Do you feel uneasy
about accepting personal liability for the actions of fellow owners?
No single form of ownership will give you everything you desire. You’ll have to make
some trade-offs. Because each option has both advantages and disadvantages, your job is to
decide which one offers the features that are most important to you. In the following sections
we’ll compare three ownership options (sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation) on these
eight dimensions.

Sole Proprietorship and its Advantages
In a sole proprietorship, as the owner, you have complete control over your business.
You make all important decisions and are generally responsible for all day-to-day activities. In
exchange for assuming all this responsibility, you get all the income earned by the business.

Chapter 5

Download this book for free at:

117

Profits earned are taxed as personal income, so you don’t have to pay any special federal and
state income taxes.

Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorships
For many people, however, the sole proprietorship is not suitable. The flip side of
enjoying complete control is having to supply all the different talents that may be necessary to
make the business a success. And when you’re gone, the business dissolves. You also have
to rely on your own resources for financing: in effect, you are the business and any money
borrowed by the business is loaned to you personally. Even more important, the sole proprietor
bears unlimited liability for any losses incurred by the business. The principle of unlimited
personal liability means that if the business incurs a debt or suffers a catastrophe (say, getting
sued for causing an injury to someone), the owner is personally liable. As a sole proprietor,
you put your personal assets (your bank account, your car, maybe even your home) at risk for
the sake of your business. You can lessen your risk with insurance, yet your liability exposure
can still be substantial. Given that Ben and Jerry decided to start their ice cream business
together (and therefore the business was not owned by only one person), they could not set
their company up as a sole proprietorship.

Partnership
A partnership (or general partnership) is a business owned jointly by two or more
people. About 10 percent of U.S. businesses are partnerships131 and though the vast majority
are small, some are quite large. For example, the big four public accounting firms are
partnerships. Setting up a partnership is more complex than setting up a sole proprietorship,
but it’s still relatively easy and inexpensive. The cost varies according to size and complexity.
It’s possible to form a simple partnership without the help of a lawyer or an accountant, though
it’s usually a good idea to get professional advice.
Professionals can help you identify and resolve issues that may later create disputes among
partners.

Chapter 5

The Partnership Agreement
The impact of disputes can be lessened if the partners have executed a well-planned
partnership agreement that specifies everyone’s rights and responsibilities. The agreement
might provide such details as the following:



Amount of cash and other contributions to be made by each partner



Division of partnership income (or loss)



Partner responsibilities—who does what



Conditions under which a partner can sell an interest in the company



Conditions for dissolving the partnership



Conditions for settling disputes

Unlimited Liability and the Partnership
A major problem with partnerships, as with sole proprietorships, is unlimited liability: in
this case, each partner is personally liable not only for his or her own actions but also for the
actions of all the partners. If your partner in an architectural firm makes a mistake that causes
a structure to collapse, the loss your business incurs impacts you just as much as it would him
or her. And here’s the really bad news: if the business doesn’t have the cash or other assets to
cover losses, you can be personally sued for the amount owed. In other words, the party who
suffered a loss because of the error can sue you for your personal assets. Many people are
understandably reluctant to enter into partnerships because of unlimited liability. Certain forms
of businesses allow owners to limit their liability. These include limited partnerships and
corporations.

Limited Partnerships
The law permits business owners to form a limited partnership which has two types of
partners: a single general partner who runs the business and is responsible for its liabilities,
and any number of limited partners who have limited involvement in the business and whose
losses are limited to the amount of their investment.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Partnerships
The partnership has several advantages over the sole proprietorship. First, it brings
together a diverse group of talented individuals who share responsibility for running the

business. Second, it makes financing easier: the business can draw on the financial resources
of a number of individuals. The partners not only contribute funds to the business but can also
use personal resources to secure bank loans. Finally, continuity needn’t be an issue because
partners can agree legally to allow the partnership to survive if one or more partners die.
Still, there are some negatives. First, as discussed earlier, partners are subject to
unlimited liability. Second, being a partner means that you have to share decision making, and
many people aren’t comfortable with that situation. Not surprisingly, partners often have
differences of opinion on how to run a business, and disagreements can escalate to the point
of jeopardizing the continuance of the business. Third, in addition to sharing ideas, partners
also share profits. This arrangement can work as long as all partners feel that they’re being
rewarded according to their efforts and accomplishments, but that isn’t always the case. While
the partnership form of ownership is viewed negatively by some, it was particularly appealing
to Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield. Starting their ice cream business as a partnership was
inexpensive and let them combine their limited financial resources and use their diverse skills
and talents. As friends they trusted each other and welcomed shared decision making and
profit sharing. They were also not reluctant to be held personally liable for each other’s actions.

Corporation
A corporation (sometimes called a regular or C-corporation) differs from a sole
proprietorship and a partnership because it’s a legal entity that is entirely separate from the
parties who own it. It can enter into binding contracts, buy and sell property, sue and be sued,
be held responsible for its actions, and be taxed. Once businesses reach any substantial size,
it is advantageous to organize as a corporation so that its owners can limit their liability.
Corporations, then, tend to be far larger, on average, than businesses using other forms of
ownership. As Figure 5.2 shows, corporations account for 18 percent of all U.S. businesses
but generate almost 82 percent of the revenues.132 Most large well-known businesses are
corporations, but so are many of the smaller firms with which likely you do business.

Figure 5.2: Types of U.S. Businesses

Ownership and Stock
Corporations are owned by shareholders who invest money in the business by buying
shares of stock. The portion of the corporation they own depends on the percentage of stock
they hold. For example, if a corporation has issued 100 shares of stock, and you own 30
shares, you own 30 percent of the company. The shareholders elect a board of directors, a
group of people (primarily from outside the corporation) who are legally responsible for
governing the corporation. The board oversees the major policies and decisions made by the
corporation, sets goals and holds management accountable for achieving them, and hires and
evaluates the top executive, generally called the CEO (chief executive officer). The board
also approves the distribution of income to shareholders in the form of cash payments called
dividends.

Benefits of Incorporation
The corporate form of organization offers several advantages, including limited liability
for shareholders, greater access to financial resources, specialized management, and
continuity.

Limited Liability
The most important benefit of incorporation is the limited liability to which shareholders
are exposed: they are not responsible for the obligations of the corporation, and they can lose
no more than the amount that they have personally invested in the company. Limited liability

would have been a big plus for the unfortunate individual whose business partner burned down
their dry cleaning establishment. Had they been incorporated, the corporation would have
been liable for the debts incurred by the fire. If the corporation didn’t have enough money to
pay the debt, the individual shareholders would not have been obligated to pay anything. They
would have lost all the money that they’d invested in the business, but no more.

Financial Resources
Incorporation also makes it possible for businesses to raise funds by selling stock. This
is a big advantage as a company grows and needs more funds to operate and compete.
Depending on its size and financial strength, the corporation also has an advantage over other
forms of business in getting bank loans. An established corporation can borrow its own funds,
but when a small business needs a loan, the bank usually requires that it be guaranteed by its
owners.

Specialized Management
Because of their size and ability to pay high sales commissions and benefits,
corporations are generally able to attract more skilled and talented employees than are
proprietorships and partnerships.

Continuity and Transferability
Another advantage of incorporation is continuity. Because the corporation has a legal
life separate from the lives of its owners, it can (at least in theory) exist forever.
Transferring ownership of a corporation is easy: shareholders simply sell their stock to
others. Some founders, however, want to restrict the transferability of their stock and so
choose to operate as a privately-held corporation. The stock in these corporations is held by
only a few individuals, who are not allowed to sell it to the general public.
Companies with no such restrictions on stock sales are called public corporations; stock
is available for sale to the general public.

Drawbacks to Incorporation
Like sole proprietorships and partnerships, corporations have both positive and negative
aspects. In sole proprietorships and partnerships, for instance, the individuals who own and

manage a business are the same people. Corporate managers, however, don’t necessarily
own stock, and shareholders don’t necessarily work for the company. This situation can be
troublesome if the goals of the two groups differ significantly.
Managers, for example, are often more interested in career advancement than the
overall profitability of the company. Stockholders might care more about profits without regard
for the well-being of employees. This situation is known as the agency problem, a conflict of
interest inherent in a relationship in which one party is supposed to act in the best interest of
the other. It is often quite difficult to prevent self-interest from entering into these situations.
Another drawback to incorporation—one that often discourages small businesses from
incorporating—is the fact that corporations are more costly to set up. When you combine filing
and licensing fees with accounting and attorney fees, incorporating a business could set you
back by $1,000 to $6,000 or more depending on the size and scope of your business.133
Additionally, corporations are subject to levels of regulation and governmental oversight that
can place a burden on small businesses. Finally, corporations are subject to what’s generally
called “double taxation.” Corporations are taxed by the federal and state governments on
their earnings. When these earnings are distributed as dividends, the shareholders pay taxes
on these dividends. Corporate profits are thus taxed twice—the corporation pays the taxes the
first time and the shareholders pay the taxes the second time.
Five years after starting their ice cream business, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield
evaluated the pros and cons of the corporate form of ownership, and the “pros” won. The
primary motivator was the need to raise funds to build a $2 million manufacturing facility. Not
only did Ben and Jerry decide to switch from a partnership to a corporation, but they also
decided to sell shares of stock to the public (and thus become a public corporation). Their sale
of stock to the public was a bit unusual: Ben and Jerry wanted the community to own the
company, so instead of offering the stock to anyone interested in buying a share, they offered
stock to residents of Vermont only. Ben believed that “business has a responsibility to give
back to the community from which it draws its support.”134 He wanted the company to be
owned by those who lined up in the gas station to buy cones. The stock was so popular that
one in every hundred Vermont families bought stock in the company. 135 Eventually, as the
company continued to expand, the stock was sold on a national level.

Other Types of Business Ownership
In addition to the three commonly adopted forms of business organization—sole
proprietorship, partnership, and regular corporations—some business owners select other
forms of organization to meet their particular needs. We’ll look at several of these options:

 Limited-liability companies
 Cooperatives
 Not-for-profit corporations
Limited-Liability Companies
How would you like a legal form of organization that provides the attractive features of
the three common forms of organization (corporation, sole proprietorship and partnership) and
avoids the unattractive features of these three organization forms? The limited-liability
company (LLC) accomplishes exactly that. This form provides business owners with limited
liability (a key advantage of corporations) and no “double taxation” (a key advantage of sole
proprietorships and partnerships). Let’s look at the LLC in more detail.
In 1977, Wyoming became the first state to allow businesses to operate as limitedliability companies. Twenty years later, in 1997, Hawaii became the last state to give its
approval to the new organization form. Since then, the limited-liability company has increased
in popularity. Its rapid growth was fueled in part by changes in state statutes that permit a
limited-liability company to have just one member. The trend to LLCs can be witnessed by
reading company names on the side of trucks or on storefronts in your city. It is common to
see names such as Jim Evans Tree Care, LLC, and For-Cats-Only Veterinary Clinic, LLC. But
LLCs are not limited to small businesses. Companies such as Crayola, Domino’s Pizza, RitzCarlton Hotel Company, and iSold It (which helps people sell their unwanted belongings on
eBay) are operating under the limited-liability form of organization.
In a limited-liability company, owners (called members rather than shareholders) are not
personally liable for debts of the company, and its earnings are taxed only once, at the
personal level (thereby eliminating double taxation).

We have touted the benefits of limited liability protection for an LLC. We now need to
point out some circumstances under which an LLC member (or a shareholder in a corporation)
might be held personally liable for the debts of his or her company. A business owner can be
held personally liable if he or she:

 Personally guarantees a business debt or bank loan which the company fails to pay.
 Fails to pay employment taxes to the government.
 Engages in fraudulent or illegal behavior that harms the company or someone else.
 Does not treat the company as a separate legal entity, for example, uses company
assets for personal uses.

Cooperatives
A cooperative (also known as a co-op) is a

Figure 5.3: The Ocean Spray™ logo

business owned and controlled by those who use its
services. Individuals and firms who belong to the
cooperative join together to market products, purchase
supplies, and provide services for its members. If run
correctly, cooperatives increase profits for its producer-members and lower costs for its
consumer-members. Cooperatives are fairly common in the agricultural community. For
example, some 750 cranberry and grapefruit member growers market their cranberry sauce,
fruit juices, and dried cranberries through the Ocean Spray Cooperative. 136 More than three
hundred thousand farmers obtain products they need for production—feed, seed, fertilizer,
farm supplies, fuel—through the Southern States Cooperative.137 Co-ops also exist outside
agriculture. For example, REI (Recreational Equipment Incorporated), which sells quality
outdoor gear, is the largest consumer cooperative in the United States, with more than three
million active members. The company shares its financial success each year with its members,
who get a refund each year based on their eligible purchases.138

Not-for-Profit Corporations
A not-for-profit corporation (sometimes called a nonprofit) is an organization formed
to serve some public purpose rather than for financial gain. As long as the organization’s
activity is for charitable, religious, educational, scientific, or literary purposes, it can be exempt

125

from paying income taxes. Additionally, individuals and other organizations that contribute to
the not-for-profit corporation can take a tax deduction for those contributions. The types of
groups that normally apply for nonprofit status vary widely and include churches, synagogues,
mosques, and other places of worship; museums; universities; and conservation groups.
There are more than 1.5 million not-for-profit organizations in the United States.139
Some are extremely well funded, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has an
endowment of approximately $40 billion and has given away $36.7 billion since its inception.140
Others are nationally recognized, such as United Way, Goodwill Industries, Habitat for
Humanity, and the Red Cross. Yet the vast majority is neither rich nor famous, but
nevertheless makes significant contributions to society.

Mergers and Acquisitions
The headline read, “Wanted: More than 2,000 in Google Hiring Spree.”141 The largest
Web search engine in the world was disclosing its plans to grow internally and increase its
workforce by more than 2,000 people, with half of the hires coming from the United States and
the other half coming from other countries. The added employees will help the company
expand into new markets and battle for global talent in the competitive Internet information
providers industry. When properly executed, internal growth benefits the firm.
An alternative approach to growth is to merge with or acquire another company. The
rationale behind growth through merger or acquisition is that 1 + 1 = 3: the combined company
is more valuable than the sum of the two separate companies. This rationale is attractive to
companies facing competitive pressures. To grab a bigger share of the market and improve
profitability, companies will want to become more cost efficient by combining with other
companies.

Mergers and Acquisitions
Though they are often used as if they’re synonymous, the terms merger and acquisition
mean slightly different things. A merger occurs when two companies combine to form a new

126

Chapter 5

company. An acquisition is the purchase of one company by another. An example of a
merger is the merging in 2013 of US Airways and American Airlines. The combined company,
the largest carrier in the world, flies under the name American Airlines.
Another example of an acquisition is the purchase of Reebok by Adidas for $3.8
billion.142 The deal was expected to give Adidas a stronger presence in North America and
help the company compete with rival Nike. Once this acquisition was completed, Reebok as a
company ceased to exist, though Adidas still sells shoes under the Reebok brand.

Motives behind Mergers and Acquisitions
Companies are motivated to merge or acquire other companies for a number of
reasons, including the following.
Gain Complementary Products
Acquiring complementary products was the motivation behind Adidas’s acquisition of
Reebok. As Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer stated in a conference call, “This is a once-in- alifetime opportunity. This is a perfect fit for both companies, because the companies are so
complementary…. Adidas is grounded in sports performance with such products as a
motorized running shoe and endorsement deals with such superstars as British soccer player
David Beckham. Meanwhile, Reebok plays heavily to the melding of sports and entertainment
with endorsement deals and products by Nelly, Jay-Z, and 50 Cent. The combination could be
deadly to Nike.” Of course, Nike has continued to thrive, but one can’t blame Hainer for his
optimism.143
Attain New Markets or Distribution Channels
Gaining new markets was a significant factor in the 2005 merger of US Airways and
America West. US Airways was a major player on the East Coast, the Caribbean, and Europe,
while America West was strong in the West. The expectations were that combining the two
carriers would create an airline that could reach more markets than either carrier could do on
its own.144
Realize Synergies
The purchase of Pharmacia Corporation (a Swedish pharmaceutical company) by Pfizer

Chapter 5

127

(a research-based pharmaceutical company based in the United States) in 2003 created one
of the world’s largest drug makers and pharmaceutical companies, by revenue, in every major
market around the globe.145 The acquisition created an industry giant with more than $48
billion in revenue and a research-and-development budget of more than $7 billion. Each day,
almost forty million people around the globe are treated with Pfizer medicines.146 Its
subsequent $68 billion purchase of rival drug maker Wyeth further increased its presence in
the pharmaceutical market.147
In pursuing these acquisitions, Pfizer likely identified many synergies: quite simply, a
whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. There are many examples of synergies. A
merger typically results in a number of redundant positions; the combined company does not
likely need two vice-presidents of marketing, two chief financial officers, and so on. Eliminating
the redundant positions leads to significant cost savings that would not be realized if the two
companies did not merge. Let’s say each of the companies was operating factories at 50% of
capacity, and by merging, one factory could be closed and sold. That would also be an
example of a synergy. Companies bring different strengths and weaknesses into the merged
entity. If the newly-combined company can take advantage of the marketing capabilities of the
stronger entity and the distribution capabilities of the other (assuming they are stronger), the
new company can realize synergies in both of these functions.
Hostile Takeover
What happens, though, if one company wants to acquire another company, but that
company doesn’t want to be acquired? The outcome could be a hostile takeover—an act of
assuming control that’s resisted by the targeted company’s management and its board of
directors. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield found themselves in one of these situations:
Unilever—a very large Dutch/British company that owns three ice cream brands—wanted to
buy Ben & Jerry’s, against the founders’ wishes. Most of the Ben & Jerry’s stockholders sided
with Unilever. They had little confidence in the ability of Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield to
continue managing the company and were frustrated with the firm’s social-mission focus. The
stockholders liked Unilever’s offer to buy their Ben & Jerry’s stock at almost twice its current
market price and wanted to take their profits. In the end, Unilever won; Ben & Jerry’s was
acquired by Unilever in a hostile takeover.148 Despite fears that the company’s social mission

would end, it didn’t happen. Though neither Ben Cohen nor Jerry Greenfield are involved in the
current management of the company, they have returned to their social activism roots and are
heavily involved in numerous social initiatives sponsored by the company.

1)

A sole proprietorship, a business owned by only one person, accounts for
72% of all U.S. businesses.

a. Advantages include: complete control for the owner, easy and inexpensive
to form, and owner gets to keep all of the profits.
b. Disadvantages include: unlimited liability for the owner, complete
responsibility for talent and financing, and business dissolves if the owner
dies.

2)

A general partnership is a business owned jointly by two or more people,
and accounts for about 10% of all U.S. businesses.

a. Advantages include: more resources and talents come with an increase in
partners, and the business can continue even after the death of a partner.
b. Disadvantages include: partnership disputes, unlimited liability, and shared
profits.

3)

A limited partnership has a single general partner who runs the business
and is responsible for its liabilities, plus any number of limited partners who
have limited involvement in the business and whose losses are limited to
the amount of their investment.

4)

A corporation is a legal entity that’s separate from the parties who own it,
the shareholders who invest by buying shares of stock. Corporations are
governed by a Board of Directors, elected by the shareholders.

a. Advantages include: limited liability, easier access to financing, and
unlimited life for the corporation.
b. Disadvantages include: the agency problem, double taxation, and
incorporation expenses and regulations.

Cover Story: Build a Better “Baby” and
They Will Come
One balmy San Diego evening in 1993, Mary and Rick Jurmain were watching a TV
program about teenage pregnancy.149 To simulate the challenge of caring for an infant, teens
on the program were assigned to tend baby-size sacks of flour. Rick, a father of two young
children, remarked that trundling around a sack of flour wasn’t exactly a true- to-life
experience. In particular, he argued, sacks of flour simulated only abnormally happy babies—
babies who didn’t cry, especially in the middle of the night. Half-seriously, Mary suggested that
her husband—a between-jobs aerospace engineer— build a better baby, and within a couple
of weeks, a prototype was born. Rick’s brainchild was a bouncing 6.5-pound bundle of vinylcovered joy with an internal computer to simulate infant crying at realistic, random intervals. He
also designed a drug-affected model to simulate tremors from withdrawal, and each model
monitored itself for neglect or ill treatment.
The Jurmains patented Baby Think It Over and started production in 1994 as Baby
Think It Over Inc. Their first “factory” was their garage, and the “office” was the kitchen table—
“a little business in a house,” as Mary put it. With a boost from articles in USA Today,
Newsweek, Forbes, and People—plus a “Product of the Year” nod from Fortune—news of the
Jurmains’ “infant simulator” eventually spread to the new company’s targeted education
market, and by 1998, some forty thousand simulators had been babysat by more than a million
teenagers in nine countries. By that time, the company had moved to Wisconsin, where it had
been rechristened BTIO Educational Products Inc. to reflect an expanded product line that now
includes not only dolls and equipment, like the Shaken Baby Syndrome Simulator, but also
simulator-based programs like START Addiction Education and Realityworks Pregnancy
Profile. BTIO was retired and replaced by the new and improved RealCare Baby and,
ultimately, by RealCare Baby II–Plus, which requires the participant to determine what the
“baby” needs when it cries and downloads data to record misconduct. In 2003, the name of the
Jurmains’ company was changed once again, this time to Realityworks Inc.

In developing BTIO and Realityworks Inc., the Jurmains were doing what entrepreneurs
do (and doing it very well). In fact, Mary was nominated three times for the Ernst & Young
Entrepreneur of the Year Award and named 2001 Wisconsin Entrepreneurial Woman of the
Year by the National Association of Women Business Owners. So what, exactly, is an
entrepreneur and what does one do? According to one definition, an entrepreneur is an
“individual who starts a new business” - and that’s true. Another definition identifies an
entrepreneur as someone who “uses resources to implement innovative ideas for new,
thoughtfully planned ventures.”150 But an important component of a satisfactory definition is still
missing. To appreciate fully what it is, let’s go back to the story of the Jurmains. In 1993, the
Jurmains were both unemployed—Rick had been laid off by General Dynamics Corp., and
Mary by the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. While they were watching the show about
teenagers and flour sacks, they were living off a loan from her father and the returns from a
timely investment in coffee futures. Rick recalls that the idea for a method of creating BTIO
came to him while “I was awake in bed, worrying about being unemployed.” He was struggling
to find a way to feed his family. He had to make the first forty simulators himself, and at the
end of the first summer, BTIO had received about four hundred orders—a promising start,
perhaps, but, at $250 per baby (less expenses), not exactly a windfall. “We were always about
one month away from bankruptcy,” recalls Mary.
At the same time, it’s not as if the Jurmains started up BTIO simply because they had
no “conventional” options for improving their financial prospects. Rick, as we’ve seen, was an
aerospace engineer, and his résumé includes work on space-shuttle missions at NASA. Mary,
who has not only a head for business but also a degree in industrial engineering, has worked
at the Johnson Space Center. Therefore, the idea of replacing a sack of flour with a computercontrolled simulator wasn’t necessarily rocket science for the couple. But taking advantage of
that idea—choosing to start a new business and to commit themselves to running it—was a
risk. Risk taking is the missing component that we’re looking for in a definition of
entrepreneurship, and so we’ll define an entrepreneur as someone who identifies a business
opportunity and assumes the risk of creating and running a business to take advantage of it.
To be successful, entrepreneurs must be comfortable with risk, positive and confident, well
organized, and very hard working people.

The Nature of Entrepreneurship
If we look a little more closely at the definition of entrepreneurship, we can identify
three characteristics of entrepreneurial activity:151
1) Innovation. Entrepreneurship generally means offering a new product, applying a
new technique or technology, opening a new market, or developing a new form of
organization for the purpose of producing or enhancing a product.
2) Running a business. A business, as we saw in Chapter 1 "The Foundations of
Business," combines resources to produce goods or services. Entrepreneurship
means setting up a business to make a profit.
3) Risk taking. The term risk means that the outcome of the entrepreneurial venture
can’t be known. Entrepreneurs, therefore, are always working under a certain
degree of uncertainty, and they can’t know the outcomes of many of the decisions
that they have to make. Consequently, many of the steps they take are motivated
mainly by their confidence in the innovation and in their understanding of the
business environment in which they’re operating.
It is easy to recognize these characteristics in the entrepreneurial experience of the
Jurmains. They certainly had an innovative idea. But was it a good business idea? In a
practical sense, a “good” business idea has to become something more than just an idea. If,
like the Jurmains, you’re interested in generating income from your idea, you’ll probably need
to turn it into a product—something that you can market because it satisfies a need. If you
want to develop a product, you’ll need some kind of organization to coordinate the resources
necessary to make it a reality (in other words, a business). Risk enters the equation when you
make the decision to start up a business and when you commit yourself to managing it.

So what about you? Do you ever wonder what it would be like to start your own
business? You might even turn into a “serial entrepreneur” like Marcia Kilgore.152 After high
school, she moved from Canada to New York City to attend Columbia University. But when her
financial aid was delayed, Marcia abandoned her plans to
attend college and took a job as a personal trainer (a natural

Figure 6.1: Facebook founder

occupation for a former bodybuilder and middleweight title
holder). But things got boring in the summer when her wealthy
clients left the city for the Hamptons. To keep busy, she took a
skin care course at a Manhattan cosmetology institute. As a
teenager, she was self-conscious about her complexion and
wanted to know how to treat it herself. She learned how to
give facials and work with natural remedies. She started giving
facials to her fitness clients who were thrilled with the results.
As demand for her services exploded, she started her first
business—Bliss Spa—and picked up celebrity clients,
including Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, and Jennifer Lopez. The business went international, and
she sold it for more than $30 million.153
But the story doesn’t end here; she launched two more companies: Soap and Glory, a
supplier of affordable beauty products sold at Target, and FitFlops, which sells sandals that
tone and tighten your leg muscles as you walk. Oprah loves Kilgore’s sandals and plugged
them on her show.154 You can’t get a better endorsement than that. Kilgore never did finish
college, but when asked if she would follow the same path again, she said, “If I had to decide
what to do all over again, I would make the same choices…I found by accident what I'm good
at, and I'm glad I did.”
So, a few questions to consider if you want to go into business for yourself:

 How do I come up with a business idea?
 Should I build a business from scratch, buy an existing business, or invest in a
franchise?

 What steps are involved in developing a business plan?
 Where could I find help in getting my business started?

In this chapter, we’ll provide some answers to questions like these.

Why Start Your Own Business?
What sort of characteristics distinguishes those who start businesses from those who
don’t? Or, more to the point, why do some people actually follow through on the desire to start
up their own businesses? The most common reasons for starting a business are the following:

 To be your own boss
 To accommodate a desired lifestyle
 To achieve financial independence
 To enjoy creative freedom
 To use your skills and knowledge
The Small Business Administration (SBA) points out, though, that these are likely to
be advantages only “for the right person.” How do you know if you’re one of the “right people”?
The SBA suggests that you assess your strengths and weaknesses by asking yourself a few
relevant questions:155

 Am I a self-starter? You’ll need to develop and follow through on your ideas.
 How well do I get along with different personalities? Strong working relationships
with a variety of people are crucial.

 How good am I at making decisions? Especially under pressure…..
 Do I have the physical and emotional stamina? Expect six or seven work days of
about twelve hours every week.

 How well do I plan and organize? Poor planning is the culprit in most business
failures.

 How will my business affect my family? Family members need to know what to
expect: long hours and, at least initially, a more modest standard of living.
Before we discuss why businesses fail we should consider why a huge number of
business ideas never even make it to the grand opening. One business analyst cites four
reservations (or fears) that prevent people from starting businesses:156

 Money. Without cash, you can’t get very far. What to do: line up initial financing
early or at least have done enough research to have a plan to raise money.

 Security. A lot of people don’t want to sacrifice the steady income that comes with
the nine-to-five job. What to do: don’t give up your day job. Run the business parttime or connect with someone to help run your business – a “co-founder”.

 Competition. A lot of people don’t know how to distinguish their business ideas from
similar ideas. What to do: figure out how to do something cheaper, faster, or better.

 Lack of ideas. Some people simply don’t know what sort of business they want to
get into. What to do: find out what trends are successful. Turn a hobby into a
business. Think about a franchise. Find a solution to something that annoys you –
entrepreneurs call this a “pain point” - and try to turn it into a business.
If you’re still interested in going into business for yourself, try to regard such drawbacks
as mere obstacles to be overcome by a combination of planning and creative thinking.

Sources of Early-Stage Financing
As noted above, many businesses fail, or never get started, due to a lack of funds. But
where can an entrepreneur raise money to start a business? Many first-time entrepreneurs are
financed by friends and family, at least in the very early stages. Others may borrow through
their personal credit cards, though quite often, high interest rates make this approach
unattractive or too expensive for the new business to afford.
An entrepreneur with a great idea may win funding through a pitch competition;
localities and state agencies understand that economic growth depends on successful new
businesses, and so they will often conduct such competitions in the hopes of attracting them.
Crowd funding has become more common as a means of raising capital. An
entrepreneur using this approach would typically utilize a crowd-funding platform like
Kickstarter to attract investors. The entrepreneur might offer tokens of appreciation in
exchange for funds, or perhaps might offer an ownership stake for a substantial enough
investment.
Some entrepreneurs receive funding from angel investors, affluent investors who
provide capital to start-ups in exchange for an ownership position in the company. Many

angels are successful entrepreneurs themselves and invest not only to make money, but also
to help other aspiring business owners to succeed.
Venture capital firms also invest in start-up companies, although usually at a
somewhat later stage and in larger dollar amounts than would be typical of angel investors.
Like angels, venture firms also take an ownership position in the company. They tend to have
a higher expectation of making a return on their money than do angel investors.

Distinguishing Entrepreneurs from Small Business Owners
Though most entrepreneurial ventures begin as small businesses, not all small business
owners are entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are innovators who start companies to create new
or improved products. They strive to meet a need that’s not being met, and their goal is to grow
the business and eventually expand into other markets.
In contrast, many people either start or buy small businesses for the sole purpose of
providing an income for themselves and their families. They do not intend to be particularly
innovative, nor do they plan to expand significantly. This desire to operate is what’s sometimes
called a “lifestyle business.”157 The neighborhood pizza parlor or beauty shop, the selfemployed consultant who works out of the home, and even a local printing company—many of
these are typically lifestyle businesses.

The Importance of Small Business to the
U.S. Economy
What Is a “Small Business”?
To assess the value of small businesses to the U.S. economy, we first need to know
what constitutes a small business. Let’s start by looking at the criteria used by the Small
Business Administration. According to the SBA, a small business is one that is independently
owned and operated, exerts little influence in its industry, and (with a few exceptions) has
fewer than five hundred employees.158

Why Are Small Businesses Important?
Small business constitutes a major force in the U.S. economy. There are more than 28
million small businesses in this country, and they generate about 54 percent of sales and 55
percent of jobs in the U.S.159 The millions of individuals who have started businesses in the
United States have shaped the business world as we know it today. Some small business
founders like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison have even gained places in history. Others,
including Bill Gates (Microsoft), Sam Walton (Wal-Mart), Steve Jobs (Apple Computer), and
Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google), have changed the way business is done today.
Aside from contributions to our general economic well-being, founders of small
businesses also contribute to growth and vitality in specific areas of economic and
socioeconomic development. In particular, small businesses do the following:

 Create jobs
 Spark innovation
 Provide opportunities for many people, including women and minorities, to achieve
financial success and independence
In addition, they complement the economic activity of large organizations by providing
them with components, services, and distribution of their products. Let’s take a closer look at
each of these contributions.

Job Creation
The majority of U.S. workers first entered the business world working for small
businesses. Although the split between those working in small companies and those working in
big companies is about even, small firms hire more frequently and fire more frequently than do
big companies.160 Why is this true? At any given point in time, lots of small companies are
started and some expand. These small companies need workers and so hiring takes place.
But the survival and expansion rates for small firms is poor, and so, again at any given point in
time, many small businesses close or contract and workers lose their jobs. Fortunately, over
time more jobs are added by small firms than are taken away, which results in a net increase
in the number of workers, as seen in Figure 6.2.

The size of the net increase in the number of workers for any given year depends on a
number of factors, with the economy being at the top of the list. A strong economy encourages
individuals to start small businesses and expand existing small companies, which adds to the
workforce. A weak economy does just the opposite: discourages start-ups and expansions,
which decreases the workforce through layoffs. Figure 6.4 reports the job gains from start-ups
and expansions and job losses from business closings and contractions.

Innovation
Given the financial resources available to large businesses, you’d expect them to introduce
virtually all the new products that hit the market. Yet according to the SBA, small companies
develop more patents per employee than do larger companies. During a recent four-year
period, large firms generated 1.7 patents per hundred employees, while small firms

generated an impressive 26.5 patents

Figure 6.3: Amazon.com annual revenue growth
(revenue shown in millions of dollars)

per employee.161 Over the years, the
list of important innovations by small
firms has included the airplane, airconditioning, DNA “fingerprinting”,
and overnight national delivery.162
Small business owners are
also particularly adept at finding new
ways of doing old things. In 1994, for
example, a young computer-science
graduate working on Wall Street

came up with the novel idea of selling books over the Internet. During the first year of
operations, sales at Jeff Bezos’ new company—Amazon.com—reached half a million dollars.
In less than twenty years, annual sales had topped $107 billion.163 Not only did his innovative
approach to online retailing make Bezos enormously rich, but it also established a viable
model for the e-commerce industry.
Why are small businesses so innovative? For one thing, they tend to offer environments
that appeal to individuals with the talent to invent new products or improve the way things are
done. Fast decision making is encouraged, their research programs tend to be focused, and
their compensation structures typically reward top performers.
According to one SBA study, the supportive environments of small firms are roughly
thirteen times more innovative per employee than the less innovation-friendly environments in
which large firms traditionally operate.164
The success of small businesses in fostering creativity has not gone unnoticed by big
businesses. In fact, many large companies have responded by downsizing to act more like
small companies. Some large organizations now have separate work units whose purpose is
to spark innovation. Individuals working in these units can focus their attention on creating new
products that can then be developed by the company.

Opportunities for Women and Minorities
Small business is the portal through which many people enter the economic
mainstream. Business ownership allows individuals, including women and minorities, to
achieve financial success, as well as pride in their accomplishments. While the majority of
small businesses are still owned by white males, the past two decades have seen a substantial
increase in the number of businesses owned by women and minorities. Figure 6.4 gives you
an idea of how many American businesses are owned by women and minorities, and indicates
how much the numbers grew between 2007 and 2012.

What Industries Are Small Businesses In?
If you want to start a new business, you probably should avoid certain types of
businesses. You’d have a hard time, for example, setting up a new company to make
automobiles or aluminum, because you’d have to make tremendous investments in property,
plant, and equipment, and raise an enormous amount of capital to pay your workforce. These
large, up-front investments present barriers to entry.

Chapter 6

143

Fortunately, plenty of opportunities are still available. Many types of businesses require
reasonable initial investments, and not surprisingly, these are the ones that usually present
attractive small business opportunities.

Industries by Sector
Let’s define an industry as a group of companies that compete with one another to sell
similar products. We’ll focus on the relationship between a small business and the industry in
which it operates, dividing businesses into two broad types of industries, or sectors: the goodsproducing sector and the service-producing sector.

 The goods-producing sector includes all businesses that produce tangible goods.
Generally speaking, companies in this sector are involved in manufacturing,
construction, and agriculture.

 The service-producing sector includes all businesses that provide services but
don’t make tangible goods. They may be involved in retail and wholesale trade,
transportation, finance, entertainment, recreation, accommodations, food service,
and any number of other ventures.
About 20% of small businesses in the United States are concentrated in the goodsproducing sector. The remaining 80% are in the service sector.165 The high concentration of
small businesses in the service-producing sector reflects the makeup of the overall U.S.
economy. Over the past fifty years, the service-producing sector has been growing at an
impressive rate. In 1960, for example, the goods-producing sector accounted for 38 percent of
GDP, the service-producing sector for 62 percent. By 2015, the balance had shifted
dramatically, with the goods-producing sector accounting for only about 21 percent of GDP.166

Goods-Producing Sector
The largest areas of the goods-producing sector are construction and manufacturing.
Construction businesses are often started by skilled workers, such as electricians, painters,
plumbers, and home builders, and they generally work on local projects. Though
manufacturing is primarily the domain of large businesses, there are exceptions.
BTIO/Realityworks, for example, is a manufacturing enterprise (components come from Ohio
and China, and assembly is done in Wisconsin).

How about making something out of trash? Daniel Blake never followed his mother’s
advice at dinner when she told him to eat everything on his plate. When he served as a
missionary in Puerto Rico, Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao after his first year in college, he
noticed that the families he stayed with didn’t either. But they didn’t throw their uneaten food
into the trash. Instead they put it on a compost pile and used the mulch to nourish their
vegetable gardens and fruit trees. While eating at an all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet back
home at Brigham Young University, Blake was amazed to see volumes of uneaten food in the
trash. This triggered an idea: why not turn the trash into money? Two years later, he was
running his company—EcoScraps—collecting 40 tons of food scraps a day from 75 grocers
and turning it into high-quality potting soil that he sells online and to nurseries. His profit has
reach almost half a million dollars on sales of $1.5 million.167

Service-Producing Sector
Many small businesses in this sector are retailers—they buy goods from other firms
and sell them to consumers, in stores, by phone, through direct mailings, or over the Internet.
In fact, entrepreneurs are turning increasingly to the Internet as a venue for start-up ventures.
Take Tony Roeder, for example, who had a fascination with the red Radio Flyer wagons that
many of today’s adults had owned as children. In 1998, he started an online store through
Yahoo! to sell red wagons from his home. In three years, he turned his online store into a
million-dollar business.168
Other small business owners in this sector are wholesalers—they sell products to
businesses that buy them for resale or for company use. A local bakery, for example, is acting
as a wholesaler when it sells desserts to a restaurant, which then resells them to its
customers. A small business that buys flowers from a local grower (the manufacturer) and
resells them to a retail store is another example of a wholesaler.

A high proportion of small businesses in this sector provide professional, business, or
personal services. Doctors and dentists are part of the service industry, as are insurance
agents, accountants, and lawyers. So are businesses that provide personal services, such as
dry cleaning and hairdressing.
Figure 6.5: Small Businesses by Industry, 2012

David Marcks, for example, entered the service industry about fourteen years ago when
he learned that his border collie enjoyed chasing geese at the golf course where he worked.
While geese are lovely to look at, they can make a mess of tees, fairways, and greens. That’s
where Marcks’ company, Geese Police, comes in: Marcks employs specially trained dogs to
chase the geese away. He now has twenty-seven trucks, thirty-two border collies, and five
offices. Golf courses account for only about 5 percent of his business, as his dogs now patrol
corporate parks and playgrounds as well.169 Figure 6.5 provides a more detailed breakdown of
small businesses by industry.

Advantages and Disadvantages of
Business Ownership
Do you want to be a business owner someday? Before deciding, you might want to
consider the following advantages and disadvantages of business ownership. 170

Advantages of Small Business Ownership
Being a business owner can be extremely rewarding. Having the courage to take a risk
and start a venture is part of the American dream. Success brings with it many advantages:

 Independence. As a business owner, you’re your own boss. You can’t get fired. More
importantly, you have the freedom to make the decisions that are crucial to your own
business success.

 Lifestyle. Owning a small business gives you certain lifestyle advantages. Because
you’re in charge, you decide when and where you want to work. If you want to spend
more time on non-work activities or with your family, you don’t have to ask for the time
off. Given today’s technology, if it’s important that you be with your family all day, you
can run your business from your home.

 Financial rewards. In spite of high financial risk, running your own business gives you
a chance to make more money than if you were employed by someone else. You
benefit from your own hard work.

 Learning opportunities. As a business owner, you’ll be involved in all aspects of your
business. This situation creates numerous opportunities to gain a thorough
understanding of the various business functions.

 Creative freedom and personal satisfaction. As a business owner, you’ll be able to
work in a field that you really enjoy. You’ll be able to put your skills and knowledge to
use, and you’ll gain personal satisfaction from implementing your ideas, working directly
with customers, and watching your business succeed.

Disadvantages of Small Business Ownership
As the little boy said when he got off his first roller-coaster ride, “I like the ups but not
the downs!” Here are some of the risks you run if you want to start a small business:

 Financial risk. The financial resources needed to start and grow a business can be
extensive. You may need to commit most of your savings or even go into debt to get
started. If things don’t go well, you may face substantial financial loss. In addition,
there’s no guaranteed income. There might be times, especially in the first few years,
when the business isn’t generating enough cash for you to live on.

 Stress. As a business owner, you are the business. There’s a bewildering array of
things to worry about—competition, employees, bills, equipment breakdowns, etc.. As
the owner, you’re also responsible for the well-being of your employees.

 Time commitment. People often start businesses so that they’ll have more time to
spend with their families. Unfortunately, running a business is extremely timeconsuming. In theory, you have the freedom to take time off, but in reality, you may not
be able to get away. In fact, you’ll probably have less free time than you’d have working
for someone else. For many entrepreneurs and small business owners, a forty-hour
workweek is a myth. Vacations will be difficult to take and will often be interrupted. In
recent years, the difficulty of getting away from the job has been compounded by cell
phones, iPhones, Internet-connected laptops and iPads, and many small business
owners have come to regret that they’re always reachable.

 Undesirable duties. When you start up, you’ll undoubtedly be responsible for either
doing or overseeing just about everything that needs to be done. You can get bogged
down in detail work that you don’t enjoy. As a business owner, you’ll probably have to
perform some unpleasant tasks, like firing people.
In spite of these and other disadvantages, most small business owners are pleased with
their decision to start a business. A survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal and Cicco
and Associates indicates that small business owners and top-level corporate executives agree
overwhelmingly that small business owners have a more satisfying business experience.
Interestingly, the researchers had fully expected to find that small business owners
were happy with their choices; they were, however, surprised at the number of corporate

executives who believed that the grass was greener in the world of small business
ownership.171

Starting a Business
Starting a business takes talent, determination, hard work, and persistence. It also
requires a lot of research and planning. Before starting your business, you should appraise
your strengths and weaknesses and assess your personal goals to determine whether
business ownership is for you.172

Questions to Ask Before You Start a Business
If you’re interested in starting a business, you need to make decisions even before you
bring your talent, determination, hard work, and persistence to bear on your project.
Here are the basic questions you’ll need to address:

 What, exactly, is my business idea? Is it feasible?
 What industry do I want to enter?
 What will be my competitive advantage?
 Do I want to start a new business, buy an existing one, or buy a franchise?
 What form of business organization do I want?
After making these decisions, you’ll be ready to take the most important step in the
entire process of starting a business: you must describe your future business in the form of a
business plan—a document that identifies the goals of your proposed business and explains
how these goals will be achieved. Think of a business plan as a blueprint for a proposed
company: it shows how you intend to build the company and how you intend to make sure that
it’s sturdy. You must also take a second crucial step before you actually start up your business:
You need to get financing—the money that you’ll need to get your business off the ground.

The Business Idea
For some people, coming up with a great business idea is a gratifying adventure. For
most, however, it’s a daunting task. The key to coming up with a business idea is identifying
something that customers want—or, perhaps more importantly, filling an unmet need. Your
business will probably survive only if its purpose is to satisfy its customers—the ultimate users
of its goods or services. In coming up with a business idea, don’t ask, “What do we want to
sell?” but rather, “What does the customer want to buy?”173
To come up with an innovative business idea, you need to be creative. The idea itself
can come from various sources. Prior experience accounts for the bulk of new business idea
and also increases your chances of success. Take Sam Walton, the late founder of Wal-Mart.
He began his retailing career at JCPenney and then became a successful franchiser of a Ben
Franklin five-and-dime store. In 1962, he came up with the idea of opening large stores in rural
areas, with low costs and heavy discounts. He founded his first Wal-Mart store in 1962, and
when he died thirty years later, his family’s net worth was $25 billion.174
Industry experience also gave Howard
Schultz, a New York executive for a housewares

Seattle, Washington.

company, his breakthrough idea. In 1981, Schultz
noticed that a small customer in Seattle—
Starbucks Coffee, Tea and Spice—ordered more
coffeemaker cone filters than Macy’s and many
other large customers. So he flew across the
country to find out why. His meeting with the
owner-operators of the original Starbucks Coffee
Co. resulted in his becoming part-owner of the
company. Schultz’s vision for the company far
surpassed that of its other owners. While they wanted Starbucks to remain small and local,
Schultz saw potential for a national business that not only sold world-class-quality coffee
beans but also offered customers a European coffee-bar experience. After attempting
unsuccessfully to convince his partners to try his experiment, Schultz left Starbucks and

started his own chain of coffee bars, which he called Il Giornale (after an Italian newspaper).
Two years later, he bought out the original owners and reclaimed the name Starbucks.175

Ownership Options
As we’ve already seen, you can become a small business owner in one of three ways—
by starting a new business, buying an existing one, or obtaining a franchise. Let’s look more
closely at the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

Starting from Scratch
The most common—and the riskiest—option is starting from scratch. This approach
lets you start with a clean slate and allows you to build the business the way you want. You
select the goods or services that you’re going to offer, secure your location, and hire your
employees, and then it’s up to you to develop your customer base and build your reputation.
This was the path taken by Andres Mason who figured out how to inject hysteria into the
process of bargain hunting on the Web. The result is an overnight success story called
Groupon.176 Here is how Groupon (a blend of the words “group” and “coupon”) works: A daily
email is sent to 6.5 million people in 70 cities across the United States offering a deeply
discounted deal to buy something or to do something in their city. If the person receiving the
email likes the deal, he or she commits to buying it. But, here’s the catch, if not enough people
sign up for the deal, it is cancelled. Groupon makes money by keeping half of the revenue from
the deal. The company offering the product or service gets exposure. But stay tuned: the “daily
deals website isn’t just unprofitable—it’s bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars.”177 As with all
start-ups cash is always a challenge.

Buying an Existing Business
If you decide to buy an existing business, some things will be easier. You’ll already
have a proven product, current customers, active suppliers, a known location, and trained
employees. You’ll also find it much easier to predict the business’s future success.
There are, of course, a few bumps in this road to business ownership. First, it’s hard to
determine how much you should pay for a business. You can easily determine how much
things like buildings and equipment are worth, but how much should you pay for the fact that
the business already has steady customers?

151

In addition, a business, like a used car, might have performance problems that you can’t
detect without a test drive (an option, unfortunately, that you don’t get when you’re buying a
business). Perhaps the current owners have disappointed customers; maybe the location isn’t
as good as it used to be. You might inherit employees that you wouldn’t have hired yourself.
Careful study called due diligence is necessary before going down this road.

Getting a Franchise
Lastly, you can buy a franchise. A franchiser (the company that sells the franchise)
grants the franchisee (the buyer—you) the right to use a brand name and to sell its goods or
services. Franchises market products in a variety of industries, including food, retail, hotels,
travel, real estate, business services, cleaning services, and even weight-loss centers and
wedding services. Figure 6.7 lists the top ten franchises according to Entrepreneur magazine
for 2015 and 2016.
As you can see from Figure 6.8 on the next page, the popularity of franchising has been
growing quickly since 2011. Although

In addition to the right to use a

company’s brand name and sell its products, the franchisee gets help in picking a location,
starting and operating the business, and benefits from advertising done by the franchiser.

advantages, franchises can be very
expensive. KFC franchises, for
example, require a total investment of
$1.3 million to $2.5 million each. This
fee includes the cost of the property,
equipment, training, start-up costs, and
the franchise fee—a one-time charge
for the right to operate as a KFC outlet.
McDonald’s is in the same price range
($1 million to $2.3 million). SUBWAY

sandwich shops offer a more affordable alternative, with expected total investment ranging
from $116,000 to $263,000.179
In addition to your initial investment, you’ll have to pay two other fees on a monthly
basis—a royalty fee (typically from 3 to 12 percent of sales) for continued support from the
franchiser and the right to keep using the company’s trade name, plus an advertising fee to
cover your share of national and regional advertising. You’ll also be expected to buy your
products from the franchiser.180
But there are disadvantages. The cost of obtaining and running a franchise can be high,
and you have to play by the franchiser’s rules, even when you disagree with them. The
franchiser maintains a great deal of control over its franchisees. For example, if you own a
fast-food franchise, the franchise agreement will likely dictate the food and beverages you
can sell; the methods used to store, prepare, and serve the food; and the prices you’ll charge.
In addition, the agreement will dictate what the premises will look like and how they’ll be
maintained. As with any business venture, you need to do your homework before investing in a
franchise.

Why Some Businesses Fail and Where to
Get Help
Why Do Some Businesses Fail?
If you’ve paid attention to the occupancy of shopping malls over a few years, you’ve
noticed that retailers come and go with surprising frequency. The same thing happens with
restaurants—indeed, with all kinds of businesses. By definition, starting a business—small or
large—is risky, and though many businesses succeed, a large proportion of them don’t. Onethird of small businesses that have employees go out of business within the first two years. As
shown in Figure 6.9, nearly half of small businesses have closed by the end of their fourth
year, and 60-70 percent do not make it past their seventh year.181
As bad as these statistics on business
survival are, some industries are worse than

Figure 6.9: Survival rate of new businesses in
the U.S., 2007-2015

others. If you want to stay in business for a
long time, you might want to avoid some of
these risky industries. Even though your
friends think you make the best pizza in the
world, this doesn’t mean you can succeed as
a pizza parlor owner. Opening a restaurant or
a bar is one of the riskiest ventures (and,
therefore, start-up funding is hard to get).
You might also want to avoid the transportation industry. Owning a taxi might appear
lucrative until you find out what a taxi license costs. It obviously varies by city, but in New York
City the price tag is upward of $400,000. No wonder taxi companies are resisting Uber and Lyft
with all the energy they can muster. And setting up a shop to sell clothing can be challenging.
Your view of “what’s in” may be off, and one bad season can kill your business. The same is
true for stores selling communication devices: every mall has one or more cell phone stores so
the competition is steep, and business can be very slow.182

Businesses fail for any number of reasons, but many experts agree that the vast
majority of failures result from some combination of the following problems:

 Bad business idea. Like any idea, a business idea can be flawed, either in the
conception or in the execution. If you tried selling snow blowers in Hawaii, you
could count on little competition, but you’d still be doomed to failure.

 Cash problems. Too many new businesses are underfunded. The owner
borrows enough money to set up the business but doesn’t have enough extra
cash to operate during the start-up phase, when very little money is coming in but
a lot is going out.

 Managerial inexperience or incompetence. Many new business owners have
no experience in running a business; many have limited management skills.
Maybe an owner knows how to make or market a product but doesn’t know how
to manage people. Maybe an owner can’t attract and keep talented employees.
Maybe an owner has poor leadership skills and isn’t willing to plan ahead.

 Lack of customer focus. A major advantage of a small business is the ability to
provide special attention to customers. But some small businesses fail to seize
this advantage. Perhaps the owner doesn’t anticipate customers’ needs or keep
up with changing markets or the customer-focused practices of competitors.

 Inability to handle growth. You’d think that a sales increase would be a good
thing. Often it is, of course, but sometimes it can be a major problem. When a
company grows, the owner’s role changes. He or she needs to delegate work to
others and build a business structure that can handle the increase in volume.
Some owners don’t make the transition and find themselves overwhelmed.
Things don’t get done, customers become unhappy, and expansion actually
damages the company.

Help from the Small Business Administration
If you had your choice, which cupcake would you pick—vanilla Oreo, triple chocolate, or
latte? In the last few years, cupcake shops are popping up in almost every city. Perhaps the
bad economy has put people in the mood for small, relatively inexpensive treats.

Whatever the reason, you’re fascinated with the idea of starting a cupcake shop. You
have a perfect location, have decided what equipment you need, and have tested dozens of
recipes (and eaten lots of cupcakes). You are set to go with one giant exception: you don’t
have enough savings to cover your start-up costs. You have made the round of most local
banks, but they are all unwilling to give you a loan. So what do you do? Fortunately, there is
help available. It is through your local Small Business Administration (SBA), which offers an
array of programs to help current and prospective small business owners. The SBA won’t
actually loan you the money, but it will increase the likelihood that you will get funding from a
local bank by guaranteeing the loan.
Here’s how the SBA’s loan guarantee

Figure 6.10: Your new cupcake shop

program works: You apply to a bank for
financing. A loan officer decides if the bank
will loan you the money without an SBA
guarantee. If the answer is no (because of
some weakness in your application), the
bank then decides if it will loan you the
money if the SBA guarantees the loan. If the
bank decides to do this, you get the money
and make payments on the loan. If you
default on the loan, the government reimburses the bank for its loss, up to the amount of the
SBA guarantee.
In the process of talking with someone at the SBA, you will discover other programs it
offers that will help you start your business and manage your organization. For example, to
apply for funding you will need a well-written business plan. Once you get the loan and move to
the business start-up phase, you will have lots of questions that need to be answered. And you
are sure you will need help in a number of areas as you operate your cupcake shop.
Fortunately, the SBA can help with all of these management and technical-service tasks.
This assistance is available through a number of channels, including the SBA’s
extensive website, online courses, and training programs. A full array of individualized services
is also available. The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) assists current and

prospective small business owners with business problems and provides free training and
technical information on all aspects of small business management.
These services are available at approximately one thousand locations around the
country, many housed at colleges and universities.183
If you need individualized advice from experienced executives, you can get it through the
Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE). Under the SCORE program, a businessperson
needing advice is matched with someone on a team of retired executives who work as
volunteers. Together, the SBDC and SCORE help more than a million small businesspersons
every year.184

Noteworthy Management
Consider this scenario: you’re halfway through the semester and ready for midterms.
You open your class notes and declare them “pathetic.” You regret scribbling everything so
carelessly and skipping class so many times. That’s when it hits you: what if there was a notetaking service on campus? When you were ready to study for a big test, you could buy
complete and legible class notes. You’ve heard that there are class-notes services at some
larger schools, but there’s no such thing on your campus. So you ask yourself, why don’t I start
a note-taking business? Your upcoming set of exams may not be salvageable, but after that,
you’d always have great notes. And in the process, you could learn how to manage a business
(isn’t that what majoring in business is all about?).
You might begin by hiring a bunch of students to take class notes. Then the note takers
will e-mail them to your assistant, who’ll get them copied (on a special type of paper that can’t
be duplicated). The last step will be assembling packages of notes and, of course, selling
them. You decide to name your company “Notes-4-You.”
Figure 7.1: Management requires you to be both
efficient and effective.

It sounds like a great idea, but you’re troubled by one question: why does this business
need you? Do the note takers need a boss? Couldn’t they just sell the notes themselves? This
process could work, but it would work better if there was someone to oversee the operations: a
manager—to make sure that the operations involved in preparing and selling notes were
performed in both an effective and an efficient manner. You’d make the process effective by

Chapter 7

ensuring that the right things got done and that they all contributed to the success of the
enterprise. You’d make the process efficient by ensuring that activities were performed in the
right way and used the fewest possible resources.

What Do Managers Do?
The Management Process
The effective performance of your business will require solid management: the process
of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A plan
enables you to take your business concept beyond the idea stage. It does not, however, get
the work done. For that to happen, you have to organize things effectively. You’ll have to put
people and other resources in place to make things happen. And because your note-taking
venture is supposed to be better off with you in charge, you need to be a leader who can
motivate your people to do well. Finally, to know whether things are in fact going well, you’ll
have to control your operations—that is, measure the results and compare them with the
results that you laid out in your plan. Figure 7.2 summarizes the interrelationship between
planning and the other functions that managers perform. This chapter will explore planning,
leading, and controlling in some detail. Organizing is an especially complex topic, and will be
discussed in Chapter 8.

Planning
Without a plan, it’s hard to succeed at anything. The reason is simple: if you don’t know
where you’re going, you can’t move forward. Successful managers decide where they want to
be and then figure out how to get there; they set goals and determine the best way to achieve
them. As a result of the planning process, everyone in the organization knows what should be
done, who should do it, and how to do it.

Developing a Strategic Plan
Coming up with an idea—say, starting a note-taking business—is a good start, but it’s
only a start. Planning for it is a step forward. Planning begins at the highest level and works its
way down through the organization. Step one is usually called strategic planning: the process
of establishing an overall course of action. To begin this process, you should ask yourself a
couple of very basic questions: why, for example, does the organization exist? What value
does it create? Sam Walton posed these questions in the process of founding Wal-Mart: his
new chain of stores would exist to offer customers the lowest prices with the best possible
service.185
Once you’ve identified the purpose of your company, you’re ready to take the remaining
steps in the strategic-planning process:

 Write a mission statement that tells customers, employees, and others why your
organization exists.

 Identify core values or beliefs that will guide the behavior of members of the
organization.

 Assess the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
 Establish goals and objectives, or performance targets, to direct all the activities that
you’ll perform to achieve your mission.

162

Chapter 7

 Develop and implement tactical and operational plans to achieve goals and
objectives.
In the next few sections, we’ll examine these components of the strategic-planning
process.

Mission Statement
As we saw in an earlier chapter, the mission statement describes the purpose of your
organization—the reason for its existence. It tells the reader what the organization is
committed to doing. It can be very concise, like the one from Mary Kay Inc. (the cosmetics
company): “To enrich the lives of women around the world.” 186 Or it can be as detailed as the
one from Harley-Davidson: “We fulfill dreams inspired by the many roads of the world by
providing extraordinary motorcycles and customer experiences. We fuel the passion for
freedom in our customers to express their own individuality.”187
A mission statement for Notes-4-You could be the following: “To provide high-quality
class notes to college students.” On the other hand, you could prepare a more detailed
statement that explains what the company is committed to doing, who its customers are, what
its focus is, what goods or services it provides, and how it serves its customers.
It is worth noting that some companies no longer use mission statements, preferring to
communicate their reason for being in other manners.

Core Values
Whether or not your company has defined a mission, it is important to identify what your
organization stands for in terms of its values and the principles that will guide its actions. In
Chapter 3 on Business Ethics and Social Responsibility, we explained that the small set of
guiding principles that you identify as crucial to your company are known as core values—
fundamental beliefs about what’s important and what is and isn’t appropriate in conducting
company activities. Core values affect the overall planning processes and operations. At
Volvo, three values— safety, quality, and environmental care—define the firm’s “approach to
product development, design and production.”188 Core values should also guide the behavior
of every individual in the organization. At Coca-Cola, for instance, the values of leadership,
collaboration, integrity, accountability, passion, diversity and quality tell employees exactly

163

what behaviors are acceptable.189 Companies communicate core values to employees and
hold them accountable for putting them into practice by linking their values to performance
evaluations and compensation.
In choosing core values for Notes-4-You, you’re determined to be unique. After some
thought, you settle on teamwork, trust, and dependability. Why these three? As you plan your
business, you realize that it will need a workforce that functions as a team, trusts each other,
and can be depended on to satisfy customers. In building your workforce, you’ll seek
employees who’ll embrace these values.

Conduct a SWOT Analysis
The next step in the strategic-planning process is to assess your company’s fit with its
environment. A common approach to environmental analysis is matching the strengths of your
business with the opportunities available to it. It’s called SWOT analysis because it calls for
analyzing an organization’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It begins with
an examination of external factors that could influence the company in either a positive or a
negative way. These could include economic conditions, competition, emerging technologies,
laws and regulations, and customers’ expectations.
One purpose of assessing the external environment is to identify both opportunities
that could benefit the company and threats to its success. For example, a company that
manufactures children’s bicycle helmets would view a change in federal law requiring all
children to wear helmets as an opportunity. The news that two large sports-equipment
companies were coming out with bicycle helmets would be a threat.
The next step is to evaluate the company’s strengths and weaknesses, internal factors
that could influence company performance in either a positive or negative way. Strengths
might include a motivated workforce, state-of-the-art technology, impressive managerial talent,
or a desirable location. The opposite of any of these strengths could signal a potential
weakness (poor workforce, obsolete technology, incompetent management, or poor location).
Armed with a good idea of internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external
opportunities and threats, managers will be better positioned to capitalize on opportunities and

Chapter 7

strengths. Likewise, they want to improve on any weak areas and protect the organization from
external threats.
For example, Notes-4-You might say that by providing excellent service at a reasonable
price while we’re still small, it can solidify its position on campus. When the market grows due
to increases in student enrollment, the company will have built a strong reputation and be in a
position to grow. So even if a competitor comes to campus (a threat), the company expects to
be the preferred supplier of class notes. This strategy will work only if the note-takers are
dependable and if the process does not alienate the faculty or administration.

Set Goals and Objectives
Your mission statement affirms what your organization is generally committed to doing,
but it doesn’t tell you how to do it. So the next step in the strategic-planning process is
establishing goals and objectives. Goals are major accomplishments that the company wants
to achieve over a long period. Objectives are shorter-term performance targets that direct the
activities of the organization toward the attainment of a goal. They should be clearly stated,
achievable, and measurable: they should give target dates for the completion of tasks and
stipulate who’s responsible for taking necessary actions.190
An organization will have a number of goals and related objectives. Some will focus on
financial measures, such as profit maximization and sales growth. Others will target
operational efficiency or quality control. Still others will govern the company’s relationships with
its employees, its community, its environment, or all three.
Finally, goals and objectives change over time. As a firm reassesses its place in its
business environment, it rethinks not only its mission but also its approach to fulfilling it. The
reality of change was a major theme when the late McDonald’s CEO Jim Cantalupo explained
his goal to revitalize the company:
“The world has changed. Our customers have changed. We have to
change too. Growth comes from being better, not just expanding to have more
restaurants. The new McDonald’s is focused on building sales at existing
restaurants rather than on adding new restaurants. We are introducing a new
level of discipline and efficiency to all aspects of the business and are setting a
new bar for performance.”191

Chapter 7

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

165

This change in focus was accompanied by specific performance objectives—annual
sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and income growth of 6 to 7 percent at existing restaurants, plus
a five-point improvement (based on customer surveys) in speed of service, friendliness, and
food quality.
In setting strategic goals and performance objectives for Notes-4-You, you should keep
things simple. Because you need to make money to stay in business, you could include a
financial goal (and related objectives). Your mission statement promises “high-quality,
dependable, competitively priced class notes,” so you could focus on the quality of the class
notes that you’ll be taking and distributing. Finally, because your mission is to serve students,
one goal could be customer oriented. Your list of goals and objectives might look like this:

 Goal 1: Achieve a 10 percent return on profits in your first five years.
 Objective: Sales of $20,000 and profit of $2,000 for the first 12 months of

operation.

 Goal 2: Produce a high-quality product.
 Objective: First-year satisfaction scores of 90 percent or higher on quality of notes

(based on survey responses on understandability, readability, and completeness).

 Goal 3: Attain 98 percent customer satisfaction by the end of your fifth year.
 Objective: Making notes available within two days after class, 95 percent of the

time.

Tactical Plans
The overall plan is broken down into more manageable, shorter-term components called
tactical plans. These plans specify the activities and allocation of resources (people,
equipment, money) needed to implement the strategic plan over a given period. Often, a longrange strategic plan is divided into several tactical plans; a five-year strategic plan, for
instance, might be implemented as five one-year tactical plans.

166

Chapter 7

Operational Plans
The tactical plan is then broken down

Figure 7.3

into various operational components that
provide detailed action steps to be taken by
individuals or groups to implement the tactical
and strategic plans. Operational plans cover
only a brief period—say, a month or two. At
Notes-4-You, note-takers might be instructed
to submit typed class notes five hours earlier
than normal on the last day of the semester
(an operational guideline). The goal is to
improve the customer-satisfaction score on dependability (a tactical goal) and, as a result, to
earn the loyalty of students through attention to customer service (a strategic goal).

Plan for Contingencies and Crises
Even with great planning, things don’t always turn out the way they’re supposed to.
Perhaps your plans were flawed, or maybe something in the environment shifted
unexpectedly. Successful managers anticipate and plan for the unexpected. Dealing with
uncertainty requires contingency planning and crisis management.
Contingency Planning
With contingency planning, managers identify those aspects of the business that are
most likely to be adversely affected by change. Then, they develop alternative courses of
action in case an anticipated change does occur. You engage in contingency planning any
time you develop a backup or fallback plan.
Crisis Management
Organizations also face the risk of encountering crises that require immediate attention.
Rather than waiting until such a crisis occurs and then scrambling to figure out what to do,
many firms practice crisis management. Some, for instance, set up teams trained to deal with
emergencies. Members gather information quickly and respond to the crisis while everyone
else carries out his or her normal duties. The team also keeps the public, the employees, the

167

press, and government officials informed about the situation and the company’s response to
it.192
An example of how to handle crisis management involves Wendy’s. After learning that a
woman claimed she found a fingertip in a bowl of chili she bought at a Wendy’s restaurant in
San Jose, California, the company’s public relations
team responded quickly. Within a few days, the

Figure 7.4: A Wendy’s restaurant

company announced that the finger didn’t come from an
employee or a supplier. Soon after, the police arrested
the woman and charged her with attempted grand
larceny for lying about how the finger got in her bowl of
chili and trying to extort $2.5 million from the company.
But the crisis wasn’t over for Wendy’s. The incident was
plastered all over the news as a grossed-out public
sought an answer to the question, “Whose finger is (or
was) it?” A $100,000 reward was offered by Wendy’s to anyone with information that would
help the police answer this question. The challenge Wendy’s faced was how to entice
customers to return to its fifty San Francisco–area restaurants (where sales had plummeted)
while keeping a low profile nationally. Wendy’s accomplished this objective by giving out free
milkshakes and discount coupons to customers in the affected regions and, to avoid calling
attention to the missing finger, by making no changes in its national advertising. The crisismanagement strategy worked and the story died down (though it flared up temporarily when
the police arrested the woman’s husband, who allegedly bought the finger from a coworker
who had severed it in an accident months earlier). 193
Even with crisis-management plans in place, however, it’s unlikely that most companies
will emerge from a potentially damaging episode as unscathed as Wendy’s did. For one thing,
the culprits in the Wendy’s case were caught, and the public was willing to forgive an
organization it viewed as a victim. Given the current public distrust of corporate behavior,
however, companies whose reputations have suffered due to questionable corporate judgment
usually don’t fare as well. These companies include the international oil company, BP, whose

CEO, Tony Hayward, did a disastrous job
handling the Gulf of Mexico crisis. A BP-

Figure 7.5: BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig on
fire in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

controlled oil rig exploded in the Gulf of
Mexico, killing eleven workers and creating
the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Hayward’s
lack of sensitivity will be remembered forever;
particularly his response to a reporter’s
question on what he would tell those whose
livelihoods were ruined: “We’re sorry for the
massive disruption it’s caused their lives.
There’s no one who wants this over more than
I do. I would like my life back.” His comment was obviously upsetting to the families of the
eleven men who lost their lives on the rig.194 Then, there are the companies at which
executives have crossed the line between the unethical to the downright illegal—Arthur
Andersen, Enron, and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, to name just a few. Given the
high risk associated with a crisis, it should come as no surprise that contemporary managers
spend more time anticipating crises and practicing their crisis-management responses.

Leading
The third management function is leading—providing focus and direction to others and
motivating them to achieve organizational goals. As owner and president of Notes-4-You, you
might think of yourself as an orchestra leader. You have given your musicians (employees)
their sheet music (plans). You’ve placed them in sections (departments) and arranged the
sections (organizational structure) so the music will sound as good as possible. Now your job
is to tap your baton and lead the orchestra so that its members make beautiful music
together.195

169

Leadership Styles
It’s fairly easy to pick up a baton, cue each section, and strike up the band; but it doesn’t
mean the music will sound good. What if your cues are ignored or misinterpreted or
ambiguous? Maybe your musicians don’t like your approach to making music and will just walk
away. On top of everything else, you don’t simply want to make music: you want to inspire your
musicians to make great music. How do you accomplish this goal? How do you become an
effective leader, and what style should you use to motivate others to achieve organizational
goals?
Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers to questions like these. Over time, every
manager refines his or her own leadership style, or way of interacting with and influencing
others. Despite a vast range of personal differences, leadership styles tend to reflect one of the
following approaches to leading and motivating people: the autocratic, the democratic (also
known as participative), or the free rein.

 Autocratic style. Managers who have developed an autocratic leadership style tend
to make decisions without soliciting input from subordinates. They exercise authority
and expect subordinates to take responsibility for performing the required tasks
without undue explanation.

 Democratic style. Managers who favor a democratic leadership style generally
seek input from subordinates while retaining the authority to make the final
decisions. They’re also more likely to keep subordinates informed about things that
affect their work.

 Free-rein style. In practicing a free rein leadership style, managers adopt a “handsoff” approach and provide relatively little direction to subordinates. They may advise
employees but usually give them considerable freedom to solve problems and make
decisions on their own.
At first glance, you’d probably not want to work for an autocratic leader. After all, most
people don’t like to be told what to do without having any input. Many like the idea of working
for a democratic leader; it’s flattering to be asked for your input. And though working in a free
rein environment might seem a little unsettling at first, the opportunity to make your own

170

Chapter 7

decisions is appealing to many people. Each leadership style can be appropriate in certain
situations.
To illustrate, let’s say that you’re leading a group of fellow students in a team project for
your class. Are there times when it would be best for you to use an autocratic leadership style?
What if your team was newly formed, unfamiliar with what needs to be done, under a tight
deadline, and looking to you for direction? In this situation, you might find it appropriate to
follow an autocratic leadership style (on a temporary basis) and assign tasks to each member
of the group. In an emergency situation, such as a fire, or in the final seconds of a close ball
game, there is generally not time for debate – the leader or coach must make a split second
decision that demands an autocratic style.
But since most situations are non-emergency and most people prefer the chance to give
input, the democratic leadership style is often favored. People are simply more motivated and
feel more ownership of decisions (i.e., buy-in) when they have had a chance to offer input.
Note that when using this style, the leader will still make the decision in most cases. As long as
their input is heard, most people accept that it is the leader’s role to decide in cases where not
everyone agrees.
How about free rein leadership? Many people function most effectively when they can
set their own schedules and do their work in the manner they prefer. It takes a great deal of
trust for a manager to employ this style. Some managers start with an assumption of trust that
is up to the employee to maintain through strong performance. In other cases, this trust must
be earned over a period of time. Would this approach always work with your study group?
Obviously not. It will work if your team members are willing and able to work independently and
welcome the chance to make decisions. On the other hand, if people are not ready to work
responsibly to their best of their abilities, using the free rein style could cause the team to miss
deadlines or do poorly on the project.
The point being made here is that no one leadership style is effective all the time for all
people or in all corporate cultures. While the democratic style is often viewed as the most
appropriate (with the free rein style a close second), there are times when following an
autocratic style is essential. Good leaders learn how to adjust their styles to fit both the
situation and the individuals being directed.

Transformational Leadership
Theories on what constitutes effective leadership evolve over time. One theory that has
received a lot of attention in the last decade contrasts two leadership styles: transactional and
transformational. So-called transactional leaders exercise authority based on their rank in the
organization. They let subordinates know what’s expected of them and what they will receive if
they meet stated objectives. They focus their attention on identifying mistakes and disciplining
employees for poor performance. By contrast, transformational leaders mentor and develop
subordinates, providing them with challenging opportunities, working one-on-one to help them
meet their professional and personal needs, and encouraging people to approach problems
from new perspectives. They stimulate employees to look beyond personal interests to those
of the group.
So, which leadership style is more effective? You probably won’t be surprised by the
opinion of most experts. In today’s organizations, in which team building and information
sharing are important and projects are often collaborative in nature, transformational
leadership has proven to be more effective. Modern organizations look for managers who can
develop positive relationships with subordinates and motivate employees to focus on the
interests of the organization. Leaders who can be both transactional and transformational are
rare, and those few who have both capacities are very much in demand.196

Controlling
Let’s pause for a minute and reflect on the management functions that we’ve discussed
so far—planning, organizing, and leading. As founder of Notes-4-You, you began by
establishing plans for your new company. You defined its mission and set objectives, or
performance targets, which you needed to meet in order to achieve your mission. Then, you
organized your company by allocating the people and resources required to carry out your
plans. Finally, you provided focus and direction to your employees and motivated them to
achieve organizational objectives. Is your job finished? Can you take a well-earned vacation?
Unfortunately, the answer is no: your work has just begun. Now that things are rolling along,

you need to monitor your operations to see whether everything is going according to plan. If it’s
not, you’ll need to take corrective action. This process of comparing actual to planned
performance and taking necessary corrective action is called controlling.

A Five-Step Control Process
You can think of the control function as the five-step process outlined in Figure 7.7.
Let’s see how this process might work at Notes-4-You. Let’s assume that, after evaluating
class enrollments, you estimate that you can sell one hundred notes packages per month to
students taking a popular sophomore-level geology
course. So you set your standard at a hundred

Figure 7.6

units. At the end of the month, however, you look
over your records and find that you sold only eighty.
In talking with your salespeople, you learn why you
came up twenty packages short: it turns out that the
copy machine broke down so often that packages
frequently weren’t ready on time. You immediately
take corrective action by increasing maintenance on
the copy machine.
Now, let’s try a slightly different scenario.
Let’s say that you still have the same standard (one hundred packages) and that actual sales
are still eighty packages. In investigating the reason for the shortfall, you find that you
overestimated the number of students taking the geology course. Calculating a more accurate
number of students, you see that your original standard—estimated sales—was too high by
twenty packages. In this case, you should adjust your standards to reflect expected sales of
eighty packages.
In both situations, your control process has been helpful. In the first instance, you were
alerted to a problem that cut into your sales. Correcting this problem would undoubtedly
increase sales and, therefore, profits. In the second case, you encountered a defect in your
planning and learned a good managerial lesson: plan more carefully.

• Set the standards by which performance will be measured
• Measure performance
• Compare actual performance with the standard and identify any
deviations from the standard.
• Determine the reasons for the deviation
• Take corrective action if needed

Benchmarking
Benchmarking could be considered as a specialized kind of control activity. Rather
than controlling a particular aspect of performance (say, defects for a specific product),
benchmarking aims to improve a firm’s overall performance. The process of benchmarking
involves comparisons to other organizations’ practices and processes with the objective of
learning and improvement in both efficiency and effectiveness. Benchmarking exercises can
be conducted in a number of ways:



Organizations often monitor publicly available information to keep tabs on the
competition. Annual reports, news articles, and other sources are monitored
closely in order to stay aware of the latest developments. In academia,
universities often use published rankings tables to see how their programs
compare on the basis of standardized test scores, salaries of graduates, and
other important dimensions.

174

Chapter 7



Organizations may also work directly with companies in unrelated industries in
order to compare those functions of the business which are similar. A
manufacture of aircraft would not likely have a great deal in common with a
company making engineered plastics, yet both have common functions such as
accounting, finance, information technology, and human resources. Companies
can exchange ideas that help each other improve efficiency, and often at a very
low cost to either.



In order to compare more directly to competition without relying solely on publicly
available data, companies may enter into benchmarking consortiums in which an
outside consultant would collect key data from all participants, anonymize it, and
then share the results with all participants. Companies can then gauge how they
compare to others in the industry without revealing their own performance to
others.

Managerial Skills
To be a successful manager, you’ll have to master a number of skills. To get an entrylevel position, you’ll have to be technically competent at the tasks you’re asked to perform. To
advance, you’ll need to develop strong interpersonal and conceptual skills. The relative
importance of different skills varies from job to job and organization to organization, but to
some extent, you’ll need them all to forge a managerial career.
Throughout your career, you’ll also be expected to communicate ideas clearly, use your
time efficiently, and reach sound decisions.

Technical Skills
You’ll probably be hired for your first job based on your technical skills—the ones you
need to perform specific tasks—and you’ll use them extensively during your early career. If
your college major is accounting, you’ll use what you’ve learned to prepare financial
statements. If you have a marketing degree and you join an ad agency, you’ll use what you
know about promotion to prepare ad campaigns. Technical skills will come in handy when you

175

move up to a first-line managerial job and oversee the task performance of subordinates.
Technical skills, though developed through job training and work experience, are generally
acquired during the course of your formal education.

Interpersonal Skills
As you move up the corporate ladder, you’ll find that you can’t do everything yourself:
you’ll have to rely on other people to help you achieve the goals for which you’re responsible.
That’s why interpersonal skills, also known as relational skills—the ability to get along with
and motivate other people—are critical for managers in mid-level positions. These managers
play a pivotal role because they report to top-level managers while overseeing the activities of
first-line managers. Thus, they need strong working relationships with individuals at all levels
and in all areas. More than most other managers, they must use “people skills” to foster
teamwork, build trust, manage conflict, and encourage improvement. 197

Conceptual Skills
Managers at the top, who are responsible for deciding what’s good for the organization
from the broadest perspective, rely on conceptual skills—the ability to reason abstractly and
analyze complex situations. Senior executives are often called on to “think outside the box”—to
arrive at creative solutions to complex, sometimes ambiguous problems. They need both
strong analytical abilities and strong creative talents.

Communication Skills
Effective communication skills are crucial to just about everyone. At all levels of an
organization, you’ll often be judged on your ability to communicate, both orally and in writing.
Whether you’re talking informally or making a formal presentation, you must express yourself
clearly and concisely. Talking too loudly, rambling, and using poor grammar reduce your ability
to influence others, as does poor written communication. Confusing and error-riddled
documents (including e-mails) don’t do your message any good, and they will reflect poorly on
you.198

Time-Management Skills
Managers face multiple demands on their time, and their days are usually filled with

176

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

Chapter 7

interruptions. Ironically, some technologies that were supposed to save time, such as
voicemail and e-mail, have actually increased workloads. Unless you develop certain timemanagement skills, you risk reaching the end of the day feeling that you’ve worked a lot but
accomplished little. What can managers do to ease the burden? Here are a few commonsense suggestions:

 Prioritize tasks, focusing on the most important things first.
 Set aside a certain time each day to return phone calls and answer e-mail.
 Delegate routine tasks.
 Don’t procrastinate.
 Insist that meetings start and end on time, and stick to an agenda.
 Eliminate unnecessary paperwork.199
Decision-Making Skills
Every manager is expected to make decisions, whether alone or as part of a team.
Drawing on your decision-making skills is often a process in which you must define a
problem, analyze possible solutions, and select the best outcome. As luck would have it,
because the same process is good for making personal decisions, we’ll use a personal
example to demonstrate the process approach to decision making. Consider the following
scenario: you’re upset because your midterm grades are much lower than you’d hoped. To
make matters worse, not only are you in trouble academically, but also the other members of
your business-project team are annoyed because you’re not pulling your weight. Your lacrosse
coach is very upset because you’ve missed too many practices, and members of the
mountain-biking club of which you’re supposed to be president are talking about impeaching
you if you don’t show up at the next meeting. And your significant other is feeling ignored.

A Six-Step Approach to Decision Making
Assuming that your top priority is salvaging your GPA, let’s tackle your problem by using
a six-step approach to solving problems that don’t have simple solutions. We’ve summarized
this model in Figure 7.8200

Figure 7.8: The problem solving and decision making process

Identify the problem you want to work on
Step one is getting to know your problem, which you can formulate by asking yourself a
basic question: how can I improve my grades?

Gather relevant data
Step two is gathering information that will shed light on the problem. Let’s rehash some
of the relevant information that you’ve already identified: (a)you did poorly on your finals
because you didn’t spend enough time studying; (b) you didn’t study because you went to see
your girlfriend (who lives about three hours from campus) over the weekend before your
exams (and on most other weekends, as a matter of fact); (c) what little studying you got in
came at the expense of your team project and lacrosse practice; and (d) while you were away
for the weekend, you forgot to tell members of the mountain-biking club that you had to cancel
the planned meeting.

Clarify the problem
Once you review all the given facts, you should see that your problem is bigger than
simply getting your grades up; your life is pretty much out of control. You can’t handle

178

Chapter 7

everything to which you’ve committed yourself. Something has to give. You clarify the problem
by summing it up with another basic question: what can I do to get my life back in order?

Generate possible solutions
Let’s say that you’ve come up with the following possible solutions to your problem: (a)
quit the lacrosse team, (b) step down as president of the mountain-biking club, (c) let team
members do your share of work on the business project, and (d) stop visiting your significant
other so frequently. The solution to your main problem—how to get your life back in order—will
probably require multiple actions.

Select the best option
This is clearly the toughest part of the process. Working your way through your various
options, you arrive at the following conclusions: (a) you can’t quit the lacrosse team because
you’d lose your scholarship; (b) you can resign your post in the mountain-biking club, but that
won’t free up much time; (c) you can’t let your business-project team down (and besides, you’d
just get a low grade); and (d) she wouldn’t like the idea, but you could visit your girlfriend, say,
once a month rather than once a week. So what’s the most feasible (if not necessarily perfect)
solution? Probably visiting your significant other once a month and giving up the presidency of
the mountain-biking club.

Implement your decision and monitor your choice
When you call your girlfriend, you’re pleasantly surprised to find that she understands.
The vice president is happy to take over the mountain-biking club. After the first week, you’re
able to attend lacrosse practice, get caught up on your team business project, and catch up in
all your other classes. The real test of your solution will be the results of the semester’s finals.

Applying Your Skills at Notes-4-You
So, what types of skills will managers at Notes-4-You need? To oversee note-taking
and copying operations, first-line managers will require technical skills, probably in operations
and perhaps in accounting. Middle managers will need strong interpersonal skills to maintain
positive working relationships with subordinates and to motivate them. As president (the top
manager), because you have to solve problems and come up with creative ways to keep the
business growing, you’ll need conceptual skills. And everyone will have to communicate
effectively: after all, because you’re in the business of selling written notes, it would look pretty
bad if your employees wrote poorly. Finally, everyone will have to use time efficiently and call
on problem-solving skills to handle the day-to-day crises that seem to plague every new
company.

Organizing
If you read our chapter on Management and Leadership, you will recall developing a
strategic plan for your new company, Notes-4-You. Once a business has completed the
planning process, it will need to organize the company so that it can implement that plan. A
manager engaged in organizing allocates resources (people, equipment, and money) to
achieve a company’s objectives. Successful managers make sure that all the activities
identified in the planning process are assigned to some person, department, or team and that
everyone has the resources needed to perform assigned activities.

Levels of Management: How Managers Are Organized
A typical organization has several layers of management. Think of these layers as
forming a pyramid like the one in Figure 8.1, with top managers occupying the narrow space at
the peak, first-line managers the broad base, and middle-managers the levels in between. As

185

you move up the pyramid, management positions get more demanding, but they carry more
authority and responsibility (along with more power, prestige, and pay). Top managers spend
most of their time in planning and decision making, while first-line managers focus on day-today operations. For obvious reasons, there are far more people with positions at the base of
the pyramid than there are at the other two levels. Let’s look at each management level in
more detail.

Top Managers
Top managers are responsible for the health and performance of the organization.
They set the objectives, or performance targets, designed to direct all the activities that must
be performed if the company is going to fulfill its mission. Top-level executives routinely scan
the external environment for opportunities and threats, and they redirect company efforts when
needed. They spend a considerable portion of their time planning and making major decisions.
They represent the company in important dealings with other businesses and government
agencies, and they promote it to the public. Job titles at this level typically include chief
executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), president,
and vice president.

Middle Managers
Middle managers are in the center of the management hierarchy: they report to top
management and oversee the activities of first-line managers. They’re responsible for
developing and implementing activities and allocating the resources needed to achieve the
objectives set by top management. Common job titles include operations manager, division
manager, plant manager, and branch manager.

First-Line Managers
First-line managers supervise employees and coordinate their activities to make sure
that the work performed throughout the company is consistent with the plans of both top and
middle management. It’s at this level that most people acquire their first managerial
experience. The job titles vary considerably but include such designations as manager, group
leader, office manager, foreman, and supervisor.

Let’s take a quick survey of the management hierarchy at Notes-4-You. As president,
you are a member of top management, and you’re responsible for the overall performance of
your company. You spend much of your time setting performance targets, to ensure that the
company meets the goals you’ve set for it— increased sales, higher-quality notes, and timely
distribution.
Several middle managers report to you, including your operations manager. As a middle
manager, this individual focuses on implementing two of your objectives: producing highquality notes and distributing them to customers in a timely manner. To accomplish this task,
the operations manager oversees the work of two first-line managers—the note-taking
supervisor and the copying supervisor. Each first-line manager supervises several nonmanagerial employees to make sure that their work is consistent with the plans devised by top
and middle management.

Organizational Structure: How Companies
Get the Job Done
Building an organizational structure engages managers in two activities: job
specialization (dividing tasks into jobs) and departmentalization (grouping jobs into units).
An organizational structure outlines the various roles within an organizational, which positions
report to which, and how an organization will departmentalize its work. Take note than an
organizational structure is an arrangement of positions that’s most appropriate for your
company at a specific point in time. Given the rapidly changing environment in which
businesses operate, a structure that works today might be outdated tomorrow. That’s why you
hear so often about companies restructuring—altering existing organizational structures to
become more competitive once conditions have changed. Let’s now look at how the processes
of specialization and departmentalization are accomplished.

Specialization
Organizing activities into clusters of related tasks that can be handled by certain
individuals or groups is called specialization. This aspect of designing an organizational
structure is twofold:
1) Identify the activities that need to be performed in order to achieve organizational
goals.
2) Break down these activities into tasks that can be performed by individuals or
groups of employees.
Specialization has several advantages. First and foremost, it leads to efficiency.
Imagine a situation in which each department was responsible for paying its own invoices; a
person handling this function a few times a week would likely be far less efficient than
someone whose job was to pay the bills. In addition to increasing efficiency, specialization
results in jobs that are easier to learn and roles that are clearer to employees. But the
approach has disadvantages, too. Doing the same thing over and over sometimes leads to
boredom and may eventually leave employees dissatisfied with their jobs. Before long,
companies may notice decreased performance and increased absenteeism and turnover (the
percentage of workers who leave an organization and must be replaced).

Departmentalization
The next step in designing an organizational structure is departmentalization—
grouping specialized jobs into meaningful units. Depending on the organization and the size of
the work units, they may be called divisions, departments, or just plain groups.
Traditional groupings of jobs result in different organizational structures, and for the
sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two types—functional and divisional organizations.

Functional Organizations
A functional organization groups together people who have comparable skills and
perform similar tasks. This form of organization is fairly typical for small to medium-size
companies, which group their people by business functions: accountants are grouped together,
as are people in finance, marketing and sales, human resources, production, and research and

Chapter 8

development. Each unit is headed by an individual with expertise in the unit’s particular
function. Examples of typical functions in a business enterprise include human resources,
operations, marketing, and finance. Also, business colleges will often organize according to
functions found in a business.
There are a number of advantages to the functional approach. The structure is simple to
understand and enables the staff to specialize in particular areas; everyone in the marketing
group would probably have similar interests and expertise. But homogeneity also has
drawbacks: it can hinder communication and decision making between units and even promote
interdepartmental conflict. The marketing department, for example, might butt heads with the
accounting department because marketers want to spend as much as possible on advertising,
while accountants want to control costs.

Divisional Organizations
Large companies often find it unruly to operate as one large unit under a functional
organizational structure. Sheer size makes it difficult for managers to oversee operations and
serve customers. To rectify this problem, most large companies are structured as divisional
organizations. They are similar in many respects to stand-alone companies, except that
certain common tasks, like legal work, tends to be centralized at the headquarters level. Each
division functions relatively autonomously because it contains most of the functional expertise
(production, marketing, accounting, finance, human resources) needed to meet its objectives.
The challenge is to find the most appropriate way of structuring operations to achieve overall
company goals. Toward this end, divisions can be formed according to products, customers,
processes, or geography.
Product Divisions
Product division means that a company is structured according to its product lines.
General Motors, for example, has four product-based divisions: Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and
GMC.201 Each division has its own research and development group, its own manufacturing
operations, and its own marketing team. This allows individuals in the division to focus all their
efforts on the products produced by their division. A downside is that it results in higher costs
as corporate support services (such as accounting and human resources) are duplicated in
each of the four divisions.

Customer Divisions
Some companies prefer a customer division structure because it enables them to
better serve their various categories of customers. Thus, Johnson & Johnson’s two hundred or
so operating companies are grouped into three customer-based business segments: consumer
business (personal-care and hygiene products sold to the general public), pharmaceuticals
(prescription drugs sold to pharmacies), and professional business (medical devices and
diagnostics products used by physicians, optometrists, hospitals, laboratories, and clinics). 202
Process Divisions
If goods move through several steps during production, a company might opt for a
process division structure. This form works well at Bowater Thunder Bay, a Canadian
company that harvests trees and processes wood into newsprint and pulp. The first step in the
production process is harvesting and stripping trees. Then, large logs are sold to lumber mills
and smaller logs are chopped up and sent to Bowater’s mills. At the mill, wood chips are
chemically converted into pulp. About 90 percent is sold to other manufacturers (as raw
material for home and office products), and the remaining 10 percent is further processed into
newspaper print. Bowater, then, has three divisions: tree cutting, chemical processing, and
finishing (which makes newsprint).203
Geographical Divisions
Geographical division

enables companies that operate in
several locations to be responsive to
customers at a local level. Adidas, for
example, is organized according to
the regions of the world in which it
operates. They have eight different
regions, and each one reports its
performance separately in their
annual reports.204

Summing Up Divisional Organizations
There are pluses and minuses associated with divisional organization. On the one hand,
divisional structure usually enhances the ability to respond to changes in a firm’s environment.
If, on the other hand, services must be duplicated across units, costs will be higher. In addition,
some companies have found that units tend to focus on their own needs and goals at the
expense of the organization as a whole.

The Organization Chart
Once an organization has set its structure, it can represent that structure in an
organization chart: a diagram delineating the interrelationships of positions within the
organization. An example organization chart is shown in Figure 8.3, using our “Notes-4-You”
example from Chapter 7.
Figure 8.3: An organizational chart for “Notes-4-You”

Imagine putting yourself at the top of the chart, as the company’s president. You would
then fill in the level directly below your name with the names and positions of the people who
work directly for you—your accounting, marketing, operations, and human resources

Chapter 8

Download this book for free at:

191

managers. The next level identifies the people who work for these managers. Because you’ve
started out small, neither your accounting manager nor your human resources manager will be
currently managing anyone directly. Your marketing manager, however, will oversee one
person in advertising and a sales supervisor (who, in turn, oversees the sales staff). Your
operations manager will oversee two individuals—one to supervise note-takers and one to
supervise the people responsible for making copies. The lines between the positions on the
chart indicate the reporting relationships; for example, the Note-Takers Supervisor reports
directly to the Operations Manager.
Although the structure suggests that you will communicate only with your four direct
reports, this isn’t the way things normally work in practice. Behind every formal communication
network there lies a network of informal communications—unofficial relationships among
members of an organization. You might find that over time, you receive communications
directly from members of the sales staff; in fact, you might encourage this line of
communication.
Now let’s look at the chart of an organization that relies on a divisional structure based
on goods or services produced—say, a theme park. The top layers of this company’s
organization chart might look like the one in Figure 8.4a (left side of the diagram). We see that
the president has two direct reports—a vice president in charge of rides and a vice president in
Figure 8.4a-b: Organizational charts for divisional structures

charge of concessions. What about a bank that’s structured according to its customer base?
The bank’s organization chart would begin like the one in Figure 8.4b. Once again, the
company’s top manager has two direct reports, in this case a VP of retail-customer accounts
and a VP of commercial-customer accounts.
Over time, companies revise their organizational structures to accommodate growth and
changes in the external environment. It’s not uncommon, for example, for a firm to adopt a
functional structure in its early years. Then, as it becomes bigger and more complex, it might
move to a divisional structure—perhaps to accommodate new products or to become more
responsive to certain customers or geographical areas. Some companies might ultimately rely
on a combination of functional and divisional structures. This could be a good approach for a
credit card company that issues cards in both the United States and Europe. An outline of this
firm’s organization chart might look like the one in Figure 8.5.

Chain of Command
The vertical connecting lines in the organization chart show the firm’s chain of
command: the authority relationships among people working at different levels of the
organization. That is to say, they show who reports to whom. When you’re examining an
organization chart, you’ll probably want to know whether each person reports to one or more
supervisors: to what extent, in other words, is there unity of command? To understand why
unity of command is an important organizational feature, think about it from a personal
standpoint. Would you want to report to more than one boss? What happens if you get
conflicting directions? Whose directions would you follow?
There are, however, conditions under which an organization and its employees can
benefit by violating the unity-of-command principle. Under a matrix structure, for example,
employees from various functional areas (product design, manufacturing, finance, marketing,
human resources, etc.) form teams to combine their skills in working on a specific project or
product. This matrix organization chart might look like the one in the following figure.

expertise in particular sports categories—say, running shoes or basketball shoes. Each team
member would be evaluated by both the team manager and the head of his or her functional
department.

Span of Control
Another thing to notice about a firm’s chain of command is the number of layers
between the top managerial position and the lowest managerial level. As a rule, new
organizations have only a few layers of management—an organizational structure that’s often
called flat. Let’s say, for instance, that a member of the Notes-4-You sales staff wanted to
express concern about slow sales among a certain group of students. That person’s message
would have to filter upward through only two management layers—the sales supervisor and
the marketing manager—before reaching the president.
As a company grows, however, it tends to add more layers between the top and the
bottom; that is, it gets taller. Added layers of management can slow down communication and
decision making, causing the organization to become less efficient and productive. That’s one
reason why many of today’s organizations are restructuring to become flatter.
There are trade-offs between the advantages and disadvantages of flat and tall
organizations. Companies determine which trade-offs to make according to a principle called
span of control, which measures the number of people reporting to a particular manager. If,
for example, you remove layers of management to make your organization flatter, you end up
increasing the number of people reporting to a particular supervisor. If you refer back to the
organization chart for Notes-4-You, you’ll recall that, under your present structure, four
managers report to you as the president: the heads of accounting, marketing, operations, and
human resources. In turn, two of these managers have positions reporting to them: the
advertising manager and sales supervisor report to the marketing manager, while the
notetakers supervisor and the copiers supervisor report to the operations manager. Let’s say
that you remove a layer of management by getting rid of the marketing and operations
managers. Your organization would be flatter, but what would happen to your workload? As
president, you’d now have six direct reports rather than four: accounting manager, advertising

manager, sales manager, notetaker supervisor, copier supervisor, and human resources
manager.
So what’s better—a narrow span of control (with few direct reports) or a wide span of
control (with many direct reports)? The answer to this question depends on a number of
factors, including frequency and type of interaction, proximity of subordinates, competence of
both supervisor and subordinates, and the nature of the work being supervised. For example,
you’d expect a much wider span of control at a nonprofit call center than in a hospital
emergency room.

Delegating Authority
Given the tendency toward flatter organizations and wider spans of control, how do
managers handle increased workloads? They must learn how to handle delegation—the
process of entrusting work to subordinates. Unfortunately, many managers are reluctant to
delegate. As a result, they not only overburden themselves with tasks that could be handled by
others, but they also deny subordinates the opportunity to learn and develop new skills.

Responsibility and Authority
As owner of Notes-4-You, you’ll probably want to control every aspect of your business,
especially during the start-up stage. But as the organization grows, you’ll have to assign
responsibility for performing certain tasks to other people. You’ll also have to accept the fact
that responsibility alone—the duty to perform a task—won’t be enough to get the job done.
You’ll need to grant subordinates the authority they require to complete a task—that is, the
power to make the necessary decisions. (And they’ll also need sufficient resources.)
Ultimately, you’ll also hold your subordinates accountable for their performance.

Centralization and Decentralization
If and when your company expands (say, by offering note-taking services at other
schools), you’ll have to decide whether most decisions should still be made by individuals at
the top or delegated to lower-level employees. The first option, in which most decision making
is concentrated at the top, is called centralization. The second option, which spreads decision
making throughout the organization, is called decentralization.

Centralization has the advantage of consistency in decision-making. Since in a
centralized model, key decisions are made by the same top managers, those decisions tend to
be more uniform than if decisions were made by a variety of different people at lower levels in
the organization. In most cases, decisions can also be made more quickly provided that top
management does not try to control too many decisions. However, centralization has some
important disadvantages. If top management makes virtually all key decisions, then lower-level
managers will feel under-utilized and will not develop decision-making skills that would help
them become promotable. An overly centralized model might also fail to consider information
that only front-line employees have or might actually delay the decision-making process.
Consider a case where the sales manager for an account is meeting with a customer
representative who makes a request for a special sale price; the customer offers to buy 50%
more product if the sales manager will reduce the price by 5% for one month. If the sales
manager had to obtain approval from the head office, the opportunity might disappear before
she could get approval – a competitor’s sales manager might be the customer’s next meeting.
An overly decentralized decision model has its risks as well. Imagine a case in which a
company had adopted a geographically-based divisional structure and had greatly
decentralized decision making. In order to expand its business, suppose one division decided
to expand its territory into the geography of another division. If headquarters approval for such
a move was not required, the divisions of the company might end up competing against each
other, to the detriment of the organization as a whole. Companies that wish to maximize their
potential must find the right balance between centralized and decentralized decision making.

Key Take-Aways
1)

Managers coordinate the activities identified in the planning process
among individuals, departments, or other units and allocate the resources
needed to perform them.

2)

Typically, there are three levels of management: top managers, who are
responsible for overall performance; middle managers, who report to top
managers and oversee lower-level managers; and first-line managers,
who supervise employees to make sure that work is performed correctly
and on time.

3)

Management must develop an organizational structure, or arrangement
of people within the organization, that will best achieve company goals.

4)

The process begins with specialization—dividing necessary tasks into
jobs; the principle of grouping jobs into units is called departmentalization.

5)

Units are then grouped into an appropriate organizational structure.
Functional organization groups people with comparable skills and tasks;
divisional organization creates a structure composed of self-contained
units based on product, customer, process, or geographical division.
Forms of organizational division are often combined.

The Challenge: Producing Quality Jetboards

9.1: The PowerSki Jetboard. To see it in action, visit the company’s Web
site at http://www.powerski.com/. Watch the videos that demonstrate what
the Jetboard can do.
The product development process can be complex and lengthy. It took sixteen
years for Bob Montgomery and others at his company to develop the PowerSki
Jetboard, and this involved thousands of design changes. It was worth it, though: the
Jetboard was an exciting, engine-propelled personal watercraft - a cross between a
high-performance surfboard and a competition water-ski/wakeboard that received
extensive media attention and rave reviews. It was showered with honors, including
Time magazine’s “Best Invention of the Year” award.205 Stories about the Jetboard
appeared in more than fifty magazines around the world, and it was featured in several
movies, over twenty-five TV shows, and on YouTube.206
Montgomery and his team at PowerSki enjoyed taking their well-deserved bows for the
job they did designing the product, but having a product was only the beginning for the
company. The next step was developing a system that would produce high-quality Jetboards
at reasonable prices. Before putting this system in place, PowerSki managers had to address
several questions.

Chapter 9

201

 What kind of production process should they use to make the Jetboards?
 How large should their production facilities be, and where should they be located?
 Where should they buy needed materials?
 What systems will be needed to control the production process and ensure a quality
product?
Answering these and other questions helped PowerSki set up a manufacturing system
through which it could accomplish the most important task that it had set for itself: efficiently
producing quality Jetboards.

Operations Management in Manufacturing
Like PowerSki, every organization—whether it produces goods or provides services—
sees Job 1 as furnishing customers with quality products. Thus, to compete with other
organizations, a company must convert resources (materials, labor, money, information) into
goods or services as efficiently as possible. The upper-level manager who directs this
transformation process is called an operations manager. The job of operations
management (OM) consists of all the activities involved in transforming a product idea into a
finished product. In addition, operations managers are involved in planning and controlling the
systems that produce goods and services. In other words, operations managers manage the
process that transforms inputs into outputs. Figure 9.2 illustrates these traditional functions of
operations management.
Like PowerSki, all manufacturers set out to perform the same basic function: to
transform resources into finished goods. To perform this function in today’s business
environment, manufacturers must continually strive to improve operational efficiency. They
must fine-tune their production processes to focus on quality, to hold down the costs of

Chapter 9

materials and labor, and to eliminate all costs that add no value to the finished product. Making
the decisions involved in the effort to attain these goals is another job of operations managers.
Their responsibilities can be grouped as follows:

 Production planning. During production planning, managers determine how goods
will be produced, where production will take place, and how manufacturing facilities
will be laid out.

 Production control. Once the production process is under way, managers must
continually schedule and monitor the activities that make up that process. They must

203

solicit and respond to feedback and make adjustments where needed. At this stage,
they also oversee the purchasing of raw materials and the handling of inventories.

 Quality control. The operations manager is directly involved in efforts to ensure that
goods are produced according to specifications and that quality standards are
maintained.
Let’s take a closer look at each of these responsibilities.

Planning the Production Process
The decisions made in the planning stage have long-range implications and are crucial
to a firm’s success. Before making decisions about the operations process, managers must
consider the goals set by marketing managers. Does the company intend to be a low-cost
producer and to compete on the basis of price? Or does it plan to focus on quality and go after
the high end of the market? Many decisions involve trade-offs. For example, low cost doesn’t
normally go hand in hand with high quality. All functions of the company must be aligned with
the overall strategy to ensure success.
With these thoughts in mind, let’s look at the specific types of decisions that have to be
made in the production planning process. We’ve divided these decisions into those dealing
with production methods, site selection, facility layout, and components and materials
management.

Production-Method Decisions
The first step in production planning is deciding which type of production process is
best for making the goods that your company intends to manufacture. In reaching this
decision, you should answer such questions as:



Am I making a one-of-a-kind good based solely on customer specifications, or
am I producing high-volume standardized goods to be sold later?



Do I offer customers the option of “customizing” an otherwise standardized good
to meet their specific needs?

One way to appreciate the nature of this decision is by comparing three basic types of
processes or methods: make-to-order, mass production, and mass customization. The task of

204

Chapter 9

the operations manager is to work with other managers, particularly marketers, to select the
process that best serves the needs of the company’s customers.

Make-to-Order
At one time, most consumer goods, such as furniture and clothing, were made by
individuals practicing various crafts. By their very nature, products were customized to meet
the needs of the buyers who ordered them. This process, which is called a make-to-order
strategy, is still commonly used by such businesses as print or sign shops that produce lowvolume, high-variety goods according to customer specifications. This level of customization
often results in a longer production and delivery cycle than other approaches.

Mass Production
By the early twentieth century, a new concept of producing goods had been introduced:
mass production (or make-to-stock strategy), the practice of producing high volumes of
identical goods at a cost low enough to price them for large numbers of customers. Goods are
made in anticipation of future demand (based on forecasts) and kept in inventory for later sale.
This approach is particularly appropriate for standardized goods ranging from processed foods
to electronic appliances and generally result in shorter cycle times than a make-to-order
process.

Mass Customization
There is at least one big disadvantage to mass production: customers, as one old
advertising slogan put it, can’t “have it their way.” They have to accept standardized products
as they come off assembly lines. Increasingly, however, customers are looking for products
that are designed to accommodate individual tastes or needs but can still be bought at
reasonable prices. To meet the demands of these consumers, many companies have turned to
an approach called mass customization, which combines the advantages of customized
products with those of mass production.
This approach requires that a company interact with the customer to find out exactly
what the customer wants and then manufacture the good, using efficient production methods
to hold down costs. One efficient method is to mass-produce a product up to a certain cut-off
point and then to customize it to satisfy different customers.

One of the best-known mass customizers is Nike, which has achieved success by
allowing customers to configure their own athletic shoes, apparel, and equipment through
Nike’s iD program. The Web has a lot to do with the growth of mass customization. Levi’s, for
instance, lets customers find a pair of perfect fitting jeans by going through an online fitting
process. Oakley offers customized sunglasses, goggles, watches, and backpacks, while Mars,
Inc. can make M&M’s in any color the customer wants (say, school colors) as well as add text
and even pictures to the candy.
Naturally, mass customization doesn’t work for all types of goods. Most people don’t
care about customized detergents or paper products. And while many of us like the idea of
customized clothes, footwear, or sunglasses, we often aren’t willing to pay the higher prices
they command.

Facilities Decisions
After selecting the best production process, operations managers must then decide
where the goods will be manufactured, how large the manufacturing facilities will be, and how
those facilities will be laid out.

Site Selection
In site selection (choosing a location for the business), managers must consider
several factors:

 To minimize shipping costs, managers often want to locate plants close to suppliers,
customers, or both.

 They generally want to locate in areas with ample numbers of skilled workers.
 They naturally prefer locations where they and their families will enjoy living.
 They want locations where costs for resources and other expenses—land, labor,
construction, utilities, and taxes—are low.

 They look for locations with a favorable business climate—one in which, for
example, local governments might offer financial incentives (such as tax breaks) to
entice them to do business in their locales. For example, an enterprise zone is an
area in which incentives are used to attract investments from private companies.
Managers rarely find locations that meet all these criteria. As a rule, they identify the

206

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

Chapter 9

most important criteria and aim at satisfying them. In deciding to locate in San Clemente,
California, for instance, PowerSki was able to satisfy three important criteria: (1) proximity to
the firm’s suppliers, (2) availability of skilled engineers and technicians, and (3) favorable living
conditions. These factors were more important than operating in a low-cost region or getting
financial incentives from local government. Because PowerSki distributes its products
throughout the world, proximity to customers was also unimportant.

Capacity Planning
Now that you know where you’re going to locate, you have to decide on the quantity of
products that you’ll produce. You begin by forecasting demand for your product, which isn’t
easy. To estimate the number of units that you’re likely to sell over a given period, you have to
understand the industry that you’re in and estimate your likely share of the market by reviewing
industry data and conducting other forms of research.
Once you’ve forecasted the demand for your product, you can calculate the capacity
requirements of your production facility—the maximum number of goods that it can produce
over a given time under normal working conditions. In turn, having calculated your capacity
requirements, you’re ready to determine how much investment in plant and equipment you’ll
have to make, as well as the number of labor hours required for the plant to produce at
capacity.
Like forecasting, capacity planning is difficult. Unfortunately, failing to balance capacity
and projected demand can be seriously detrimental to your bottom line. If you set capacity too
low (and so produce less than you should), you won’t be able to meet demand, and you’ll lose
sales and customers. If you set capacity too high (and turn out more units than you should),
you’ll waste resources and inflate operating costs.

Managing the Production Process in a
Manufacturing Company
Operations managers engage in the daily activities of materials management, which
encompasses the activities of purchasing, inventory control, and work scheduling.

Purchasing and Supplier Selection
The process of acquiring the materials and services to be used in production is called
purchasing (or procurement). For many products, the costs of materials make up about 50
percent of total manufacturing costs. Not surprisingly, materials acquisition gets a good deal of
the operations manager’s time and attention. As a rule, there’s no shortage of vendors willing
to supply materials, but the trick is finding the best suppliers. Operations managers must
consider questions such as:

 Can the vendor supply the needed quantity of materials at a reasonable price?
 Is the quality good?
 Is the vendor reliable (will materials be delivered on time)?
 Does the vendor have a favorable reputation?
 Is the company easy to work with?
Getting the answers to these questions and making the right choices—a process known
as supplier selection—is a key responsibility of operations management.

e-Procurement
Technology has changed the way businesses buy things. Through e-procurement,
companies use the Internet to interact with suppliers. The process is similar to the one you’d
use to find a consumer good—say, a high-definition TV—over the Internet. To choose a TV,
you might browse the websites of manufacturers like Sony then shop prices and buy at
Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer.
If you were a purchasing manager using the Internet to buy parts and supplies, you’d
follow basically the same process. You’d identify potential suppliers by going directly to private

208

Chapter 9

websites maintained by individual suppliers or to public sites that collect information on
numerous suppliers. You could do your shopping through online catalogs, or you might
participate in an online marketplace by indicating the type and quantity of materials you need
and letting suppliers bid. Finally, just as you paid for your TV electronically, you could use a
system called electronic data interchange (EDI) to process your transactions and transmit all
your purchasing documents.
The Internet provides an additional benefit to purchasing managers by helping them
communicate with suppliers and potential suppliers. They can use the Internet to give suppliers
specifications for parts and supplies, encourage them to bid on future materials needs, alert
them to changes in requirements, and give them instructions on doing business with their
employers. Using the Internet for business purchasing cuts the costs of purchased products
and saves administrative costs related to transactions. It’s also faster for procurement and
fosters better communications.

Inventory Control
If a manufacturer runs out of the materials it needs for production, then production
stops. In the past, many companies guarded against this possibility by keeping large
inventories of materials on hand. It seemed like the thing to do at the time, but it often
introduced a new problem—wasting money. Companies were paying for parts and other
materials that they wouldn’t use for weeks or even months, and in the meantime, they were
running up substantial storage and insurance costs. If the company redesigned its products,
some parts might become obsolete before ever being used.
Most manufacturers have since learned that to remain competitive, they need to
manage inventories more efficiently. This task requires that they strike a balance between two
threats to productivity: losing production time because they’ve run out of materials and wasting
money because they’re carrying too much inventory. The process of striking this balance is
called inventory control, and companies now regularly rely on a variety of inventory-control
methods.

Just-in-Time Production
One method is called just-in-time (JIT) production: the manufacturer arranges for

Chapter 9

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

209

materials to arrive at production facilities just in time to enter the manufacturing process. Parts
and materials don’t sit unused for long periods, and the costs of “holding” inventory are
significantly cut. JIT, however, requires considerable communication and cooperation between
the manufacturer and the supplier. The manufacturer has to know what it needs and when.
The supplier has to commit to supplying the right materials, of the right quality, at exactly the
right time.

Material Requirements Planning
A software tool called material requirements planning (MRP), relies on sales
forecasts and ordering lead times for materials to calculate the quantity of each component
part needed for production and then determine when they should be ordered or made. The
detailed sales forecast is turned into a master production schedule (MPS), which MRP then
explodes into a forecast for the needed parts based on the bill of materials for each item in the
forecast. A bill of materials is simply a list of the various parts that make up the end product.
The role of MRP is to determine the anticipated need for each part based on the sales forecast
and to place orders so that everything arrives just in time for production.

Graphical Tools: Gantt and PERT Charts
To control the timing of all operations, managers set up schedules: they select jobs to
be performed during the production process, assign tasks to work groups, set timetables for
the completion of tasks, and make sure that resources will be available when and where
they’re needed. There are a number of scheduling techniques. We’ll focus on two of the most
common—Gantt and PERT charts.

Gantt Charts
A Gantt chart, named after the designer, Henry Gantt, is an easy-to-use graphical tool
that helps operations managers determine the status of projects. Let’s say that you’re in
charge of making the “hiking bear” offered by the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. Figure 9.3 is

Chapter 9

a Gantt chart for the production of one hundred of these bears. As you can see, it shows that
several activities must be completed before the bears are dressed: the fur has to be cut,
stuffed, and sewn; and the clothes and accessories must be made. Our Gantt chart tells us
that by day six, all accessories and clothing have been made. The sewing and stuffing,
however (which must be finished before the bears are dressed), isn’t scheduled for completion
until the end of day eight. As operations manager, you’ll have to pay close attention to the
progress of the sewing and stuffing operations to ensure that finished products are ready for
shipment by their scheduled date.

PERT Charts
Gantt charts are useful when the production process is fairly simple and the activities
aren’t interrelated. For more complex schedules, operations managers may use PERT charts.
PERT (which stands for Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is designed to diagram
the activities required to produce a good, specify the time required to perform each activity in
the process, and organize activities in the most efficient sequence. It also identifies a critical
path: the sequence of activities that will entail the greatest amount of time. Figure 9.4 is a
PERT diagram showing the process for producing one “hiker” bear at Vermont Teddy Bear.

Our PERT chart shows how the activities involved in making a single bear are related. It
indicates that the production process begins at the cutting station. Next, the fur that’s been cut
for this particular bear moves first to the sewing and stuffing stations and then to the dressing
station. At the same time that its fur is moving through this sequence of steps, the bear’s
clothes are being cut and sewn and its T-shirt is being embroidered. Its backpack and tent
accessories are also being made at the same time. Note that fur, clothes, and accessories all
meet at the dressing station, where the bear is dressed and outfitted with its backpack. Finally,
the finished bear is packaged and shipped to the customer’s house.
What was the critical path in this process? The path that took the longest amount of
time was the sequence that included cutting, stuffing, dressing, packaging, and shipping—a
sequence of steps taking sixty-five minutes. If you wanted to produce a bear more quickly,
you’d have to save time on this path. Even if you saved the time on any of the other paths, you
still wouldn’t finish the entire job any sooner: the finished clothes would just have to wait for the
fur to be sewn and stuffed and moved to the dressing station. We can gain efficiency only by
improving our performance on one or more of the activities along the critical path.

The Technology of Goods Production
PowerSki founder and CEO Bob Montgomery spent sixteen years designing the
Jetboard and bringing it to production. At one point, in his efforts to get the design just right,
he’d constructed thirty different prototypes. Montgomery thought that he could handle the
designing of the engine without the aid of a computer. Before long, however, he realized that it
was impossible to keep track of all the changes.

Computer-Aided Design
That’s when Montgomery turned to computer technology for help and began using a
computer-aided design (CAD) software package to design not only the engine but also the
board itself and many of its components. The CAD program enabled Montgomery and his
team of engineers to test the product digitally and work out design problems before moving to
the prototype stage.
The sophisticated CAD software allowed Montgomery and his team to put their design
paper in a drawer and to start building both the board and the engine on a computer screen.
By rotating the image on the screen, they could even view the design from every angle. Having
used their CAD program to make more than four hundred design changes, they were ready to
test the Jetboard in the water. During the tests, onboard sensors transmitted data to
computers, allowing the team to make adjustments from the shore while the prototype was still
in the water. Nowadays, PowerSki uses collaboration software to transmit design changes to
the suppliers of the 340 components that make up the Jetboard. In fact, a majority of design
work these days is done with the aid of computers, which add speed and precision to the
process.

Computer-Aided Manufacturing
For many companies, the next step

Figure 9.5: A 3-D printer

is to link CAD to the manufacturing
process. A computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM) software system
determines the steps needed to produce
the component and instructs the machines
that do the work. Because CAD and CAM
programs can “talk” with each other,
companies can build components that
satisfy exactly the requirements set by the
computer-generated model. CAD/CAM systems permit companies to design and manufacture
goods faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost, and they’re also effective in helping firms
monitor and improve quality. CAD/CAM technology is used in many industries, including the
auto industry, electronics, and clothing. If you have ever seen how a 3-D printer works, you
have a pretty good idea of how CAM works too.

Computer-Integrated Manufacturing
By automating and integrating all
aspects of a company’s operations,

computer-aided design and manufacturing
to a higher level—and are in fact
revolutionizing the production process. CIM
systems expand the capabilities of
CAD/CAM. In addition to design and
production applications, they handle such
functions as order entry, inventory control,
warehousing, and shipping. In the manufacturing plant, the CIM system controls the functions

Operations Management for Service Providers
As the U.S. economy has changed from a goods producer to a service provider over the
last sixty years, the dominance of the manufacturing sector has declined substantially. Today,
only about 8 percent of U.S. workers are employed in manufacturing, 207 in contrast to 30
percent in 1950.208 Most of us now hold jobs in the service sector, which accounts for 80
percent of U.S. jobs.209 In 2013, Wal-Mart was America’s largest employer, followed by
McDonald’s, United Parcel Service (UPS), Target and Kroger. Not until we drop down to the
ninth-largest employer—Hewlett Packard—do we find a company with a manufacturing
component.210
Though the primary function of both manufacturers and service providers is to satisfy
customer needs, there are several important differences between the two types of operations.
Let’s focus on three of them:

 Intangibility. Manufacturers produce tangible products—things that can be touched
or handled, such as automobiles and appliances. Service companies provide
intangible products, such as banking, entertainment, or education.

 Customization. Most manufactured goods are standardized. Services, by contrast,
are often customized to satisfy the specific needs of a customer. For example, when
you go to the hairdresser, you ask for a haircut that looks good on you because of
the shape of your face and the texture of your hair.

 Customer contact. You could spend your entire working life assembling cars in
Detroit and never meet a customer who bought a car that you helped to make. But if
you were a restaurant server, you’d interact with customers every day. In fact, their
satisfaction with your product would be determined in part by the service that you
provided. Unlike manufactured goods, many services are bought and consumed at
the same time.

Here is just one of the over twelve
thousand Burger King restaurants across

Figure 9.7: Burger King restaurant in Saugus,

the globe. Not surprisingly, operational
efficiency is just as important in service
industries as it is in manufacturing. To get a
better idea of the role of operations
management in the service sector, we’ll look
closely at Burger King (BK), the world’s
fourth-largest restaurant chain.211 BK has
grown substantially since selling the first
Whopper (for $0.37) almost half a century ago. The instant success of the fire-grilled burger
encouraged the Miami founders of the company to expand by selling franchises.
Today, there are BK company- and independently-owned franchised restaurants in 100
countries, and they employ over 34,000 people.212 More than eleven million customers visit BK
each day.213

Operations Planning
When starting or expanding operations, businesses in the service sector must make a
number of decisions quite similar to those made by manufacturers:

 What services (and perhaps what goods) should they offer?
 Where will they locate their business, and what will their facilities look like?
 How will they forecast demand for their services?
Let’s see how service firms like BK answer questions such as these.214

Operations Processes
Service organizations succeed by providing services that satisfy customers’ needs.
Companies that provide transportation, such as airlines, have to get customers to their
destinations as quickly and safely as possible. Companies that deliver packages, such as
FedEx, must pick up, sort, and deliver packages in a timely manner. Companies that provide

both services and goods, such as Domino’s Pizza, have a dual challenge: they must produce
a quality good and deliver it satisfactorily.
Service providers that produce goods can adopt

Figure 9.8: Dunkin’ Donuts typical
product selection

either a make-to-order or a make-to-stock approach to
producing them. BK, which encourages patrons to
customize burgers and other menu items, uses a make-toorder approach, building sandwiches one at a time. Meat
patties, for example, go from the grill to a steamer for
holding until an order comes in. Although many fast food
restaurants have adopted the make-to-order model, a few
continue to make-to-stock. For example, Dunkin’ Donuts
does not customize doughnuts, and so they do not have to
wait for customer orders before making them.
Like manufacturers, service providers must
continuously look for ways to improve operational
efficiency. Throughout its sixty-year history, BK has introduced a number of innovations that
have helped make the company (as well as the fast-food industry itself) more efficient. BK, for
example, was the first to offer drive-through service (which now accounts for over 50 percent
of its sales215).
It was also a BK vice president, David Sell, who came up with the idea of moving the
drink station from behind the counter so that customers could take over the time-consuming
task of filling cups with ice and beverages. BK was able to cut back one employee per day at
every one of its more than eleven thousand restaurants. Material costs also went down
because customers usually fill cups with more ice, which is cheaper than a beverage.
Moreover, there were savings on supply costs because most customers don’t bother with lids,
and many don’t use straws. On top of everything else, most customers liked the system (for
one thing, it allowed them to customize their own drinks by mixing beverages), and as a result,
customer satisfaction went up. Overall, the new process was a major success and quickly
became the industry standard.

Facilities
When starting or expanding a service business, owners and managers must invest a lot
of time in selecting a location, determining its size and layout, and forecasting demand. A poor
location or a badly designed facility can cost customers, and inaccurate estimates of demand
for products can result in poor service, excessive costs, or both.

Site Selection
Site selection is also critical in the service industry, but not for the same reasons as in
the manufacturing industry. Service businesses need to be accessible to customers. Some
service businesses, such as cable-TV providers, package-delivery services, and e-retailers, go
to their customers. Many others, however—hotels, restaurants, stores, hospitals, and
airports—have to attract customers to their facilities. These businesses must locate where
there’s a high volume of available customers. In picking a location, BK planners perform a
detailed analysis of demographics and traffic patterns; the most important factor is usually
traffic count—the number of cars or people that pass by a specific location in the course of a
day. In the United States, where we travel almost everywhere by car, so BK looks for busy
intersections, interstate interchanges with easy off and on ramps, or such “primary
destinations” as shopping malls, tourist attractions, downtown business areas, or movie
theaters. In Europe, where public transportation is much more common, planners focus on
subway, train, bus, and trolley stops.
Once planners find a site with an acceptable traffic count, they apply other criteria. It
must, for example, be easy for vehicles to enter and exit the site, which must also provide
enough parking to handle projected dine-in business. Local zoning must permit standard
signage, especially along interstate highways. Finally, expected business must be high enough
to justify the cost of the land and building.

Size and Layout
In the service sector, most businesses must design their facilities with the customer in
mind: they must accommodate the needs of their customers while keeping costs as low as
possible. Let’s see how BK has met this challenge.

For its first three decades, almost all BK restaurants were pretty much the same. They
all sat on one acre of land (located “through the light and to the right”), had about four
thousand square feet of space, and held seating for seventy customers. All kitchens were
roughly the same size. As long as land was cheap and sites were readily available, this system
worked well. By the early 1990s, however, most of the prime sites had been taken, if not by BK
itself, then by one of its fast-food competitors or other businesses needing a choice spot,
including gas stations and convenience stores. With everyone bidding on the same sites, the
cost of a prime acre of land had increased from $100,000 to over $1 million in a few short
years.
To continue growing, BK needed to change the way it found and developed its
locations. Planners decided that they had to find ways to reduce the size of a typical BK
restaurant. For one thing, they could reduce the number of seats, because the business at a
typical outlet had shifted over time from 90 percent inside dining to a 50-50 split between drive
through and eat-in service.
David Sell (the same executive who had recommended letting customers fill their own
drink cups) proposed to save space by wrapping Whoppers in paper instead of serving them in
the cardboard boxes that took up more space. So BK switched to a single paper wrapper with
the label “Whopper” on one side and “Cheese Whopper” on the other. To show which product
was inside, employees just folded the wrapper in the right direction. Ultimately, BK replaced
pallets piled high with boxes with just a few boxes of wrappers.
Ideas like these helped BK trim the size of a restaurant from four thousand square feet
to as little as one thousand. In turn, smaller facilities enabled the company to enter markets
that were once cost prohibitive. Now BK could locate profitably in airports, food courts, strip
malls, center-city areas, and even schools.

Capacity Planning
Estimating capacity needs for a service business isn’t the same thing as estimating
those of a manufacturer. Service providers can’t store their products for later use: hairdressers
can’t “inventory” haircuts, and amusement parks can’t “inventory” roller-coaster rides. Service
firms have to build sufficient capacity to satisfy customers’ needs on an “as-demanded” basis.

Like manufacturers, service providers must consider many variables when estimating demand
and capacity:

 How many customers will I have?
 When will they want my services (which days of the week, which times of the day)?
 How long will it take to serve each customer?
 How will external factors, such as weather or holidays, affect the demand for my
services?
Forecasting demand is easier for companies like BK, which has a long history of
planning facilities, than for brand-new service businesses. BK can predict sales for a new
restaurant by combining its knowledge of customer-service patterns at existing restaurants
with information collected about each new location, including the number of cars or people
passing the proposed site and the effect of nearby competition.

Managing Operations
Overseeing a service organization puts special demands on managers, especially those
running firms, such as hotels, retail stores, and restaurants, who have a high degree of contact
with customers. Service firms provide customers with personal attention and must satisfy their
needs in a timely manner. This task is complicated by the fact that demand can vary greatly
over the course of any given day. Managers, therefore, must pay particular attention to
employee work schedules and, in many cases, inventory management.
Managing service operations is about more than efficiency of service. It is about finding
a balance between profitability, customer satisfaction and associate satisfaction, sometimes
referred to as the balanced scorecard.
In his book titled Moments of Truth, Jan Carlzon, former Chief Executive Office of SAS
Group, refers to those moments when an employee interacts with a customer.216 Moments
can range from calling a help line, checking in at an airline counter, the greeting from a hostess
in a restaurant to having a maintenance problem resolved in a hotel guest room. The quality of
staff a company hires, how they train their employees, and the focus management places on
creating a culture of service will determine how successful the company is in service delivery
and maximizing the impact of these moments of truth.

success of Chick-Fil-A in this blog post:219

Dang I love it when I see great people and great businesses kicking butt at
what they do. Such was the case recently when the fam and I stopped into a
local Chick-fil-A restaurant here in Virginia and I was treated to a free course
entitled, “This is How To Run a Business that Kicks Butt and Takes Names….”,
or at least that something like that …..
As the kids were all eating their food and I was busy being blown away by
this perfect company and business model, I decided to ask my 9 year old
daughter a simple question:
Me: Danielle, what do you notice about this restaurant that’s different than
others?
Danielle (by now used to weird business questions from her father): Well,
first of all everyone that works here is happy.
Me: Yes, they are, aren’t they? How’s that make you feel to see them
smiling?
Danielle: It makes me feel good inside.

Me: I agree…What else do you notice?
Danielle: There are pictures everywhere. And writings on the walls. And it’s
really clean.
Me: Good observations dear. Danielle, you’re looking at the most well run
business in America.
For any of you that have been to Chick-fil-A before, you may already
understand and appreciate what I’m talking about. If you haven’t gone to one and
would like 4 years’ worth of business school wrapped up in 45 minutes, then take
a stroll on over to one of their restaurants for lunch and just sit, watch, and
observe.
But to make what could be a long blog much shorter, allow me to quickly
list the 8 reasons why Chick-fil-A has the best business model in America.
Happy Employees/Service: It’s unbelievable what type of employees this
company has. Heck, while we were eating our meal the other day, an employee
with a big smile came over and asked us if we’d like refills on our drinks. For a
fast food company, this is utterly unheard of in our society these days. It’s
obvious that Chick-fil-A doesn’t go cheap on their people nor their way of doing
things. I’m sure they pay decent wages but they also create an atmosphere that
attracts great people. What a wonderful model this is for any business.
They’re Clean!: Somewhere along the lines sanitation and cleanliness
became a lost art in the fast food industry. Notwithstanding this trend, Chick-fil-A
has bucked the system and their restaurants, as well as their bathrooms, are
almost always immaculate. I don’t know about you, but I’ll pay more for clean any
day of the week.
They Know What They’re GREAT At: Most businesses try to be a jack of
all trades, which ends up causing them to be master of none. That’s why Chickfil-A will never have a burger on their menu. Why? Because they don’t care. They
know they’ll never be the best at beef but they sure as heck have created a
culture around the chicken sandwich. Wow, what a lesson this is for those
businesses out there with no identity, niche, or individual greatness.
They Ain’t Cheap: Yep, having high prices is actually a GOOD business
model. I don’t know about you, but the idea of having to sell a lot to make a little
stinks. Chick-fil-A has prices a good bit higher than most of their fast food
competitors, notwithstanding they are always full of smiling customers, just
waiting to spend the extra green stamps. These higher prices lead to better
employees, service, food quality, customers, etc. I’m sure never once has their
management even asked, “How can we be the cheapest?” But I’d bet my home
they’ve asked, “How can we be the best, regardless of what it costs?”
Ambiance: The next time you go to Chick-fil-A check out all the little

things they do to make their restaurants warm and attractive. They have photos
of employees, quotes on the walls, paintings from local children, etc. Everywhere
you look in one of their stores you’ll find something that makes you smile.
Community Involvement: Wow do they do this better than any fast food
company. In fact, this one isn’t even close. They are constantly doing promos
within the community for youth teams, causes, etc. In fact, it’s like they’ve take
social media to another level because for them it’s not just about using Facebook
and the like, it’s about actually being involved and in the trenches. Huge props to
Chick-fil-A for this.
Awesome Website: All of you that read this blog know how I feel about
the importance of having a great website and web presence in order to be a
successful business. If you want to see what a great business website looks like,
head on over. Whether it’s bios of the employees, social media links, customers
stories, etc—this site is spot-on.
The Food is Actually Good: Ahh yes, lest we forget this other forgotten
trait of fast food restaurants—great food. Everybody likes Chick-fil-A. Nothing on
their menu is poor quality. They’re proud of their food and they have every right
to be.
So there you have it folks—the 8 qualities of the best business model in
America. What’s great is that every business can copy the way Chick-fil-A has
built their company. The qualities listed above are simply principles that can be
applied to any business or any website for that matter. So if you’re lacking
inspiration for your business, it might be time for a Chicken Sandwich and waffle
fries.
**Author’s Note: It goes without saying that I have no affiliation with Chickfil-A, I just happen to write about greatness when I see it.

Scheduling
In manufacturing, managers focus on scheduling the activities needed to transform raw
materials into finished goods. In service organizations, they focus on scheduling workers so
that they’re available to handle fluctuating customer demand. Each week, therefore, every BK
store manager schedules employees to cover not only the peak periods of breakfast, lunch,
and dinner, but also the slower periods in between. If he or she staffs too many people, labor
cost per sales dollar will be too high. If there aren’t enough employees, customers have to wait
in lines. Some get discouraged, and even leave, and many may never come back.

223

Scheduling is made easier by information provided by a point-of-sale device built into
every BK cash register. The register sends data on every sandwich, beverage, and side order
sold by the hour, every hour of the day, every day of the week to a computer system that helps
managers set schedules. To determine how many people will be needed for next Thursday’s
lunch hour, the manager reviews last Thursday’s data, using sales revenue and a specific BK
formula to determine the appropriate staffing level. Each manager can adjust this forecast to
account for other factors, such as current marketing promotions or a local sporting event that
will increase customer traffic.

Inventory Control
Businesses that provide both goods and services, such as retail stores and auto-repair
shops, have the same inventory control problems as manufacturers: keeping levels too high
costs money, while running out of inventory costs sales. Technology, such as the point-of-sale
registers used at BK, makes the job easier. BK’s system tracks everything sold during a given
time and lets each store manager know how much of everything should be kept in inventory. It
also makes it possible to count the number of burgers and buns, bags and racks of fries, and
boxes of beverage mixes at the beginning or end of each shift. Because there are fixed
numbers of supplies—say, beef patties or bags of fries—in each box, employees simply count
boxes and multiply. In just a few minutes, the manager knows whether the inventory is correct
(and should be able to see if any theft has occurred on the shift).

Producing for Quality
What do you do if your brand-new DVD player doesn’t work when you get it home?
What if you were late for a test because it took you twenty minutes to get a burger and fries at
a drive-through window? Like most people, you’d probably be more or less disgruntled. As a
customer, you’re constantly assured that when products make it to market, they’re of the
highest possible quality, and you tend to avoid brands that have failed to live up to your
expectations or to producers’ claims.

Chapter 9

But what is quality? According to the American Society for Quality, the term quality
refers to “the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or
implied needs.”220 When you buy a DVD player, you expect it to play DVDs. When you go to a
drive-through window, you expect to be served in a reasonable amount of time. If your
expectations are not met, you’ll conclude that you’re the victim of poor-quality.

Quality Management
Total quality management (TQM), or quality assurance, includes all the steps that a
company takes to ensure that its goods or services are of sufficiently high quality to meet
customers’ needs. Generally speaking, a company adheres to TQM principles by focusing on
three tasks:
1) Customer satisfaction
2) Employee involvement
3) Continuous improvement
Let’s take a closer look at these three principles.

Customer Satisfaction
Companies that are committed to TQM understand that the purpose of a business is to
generate a profit though customer satisfaction. Thus, they let their customers define quality
by identifying desirable product features and then offering them. They encourage customers to
tell them how to offer services that work the right way.
Armed with this knowledge, they take steps to make sure that providing quality is a
factor in every facet of their operations—from design, to product planning and control, to sales
and service. To get feedback on how well they’re doing, many companies routinely use
surveys and other methods to monitor customer satisfaction. By tracking the results of
feedback over time, they can see where they need to improve.

Employee Involvement
Successful TQM requires that everyone in the organization, not simply upper-level
management, commits to satisfying the customer. When customers wait too long at a drivethrough window, it’s the responsibility of a number of employees, not the manager alone. A

defective DVD isn’t solely the responsibility of the manufacturer’s quality control department;
it’s the responsibility of every employee involved in its design, production, and even shipping.
To get everyone involved in the drive for quality assurance, managers must communicate the
importance of quality to subordinates and motivate them to focus on customer satisfaction.
Employees have to be properly trained not only to do their jobs but also to detect and correct
quality problems.
In many companies, employees who perform similar jobs work as teams, sometimes
called quality circles, to identify quality, efficiency, and other work-related problems, to
propose solutions, and to work with management in implementing their recommendations.

Continuous Improvement
An integral part of TQM is continuous improvement: the commitment to making
constant improvements in the design, production, and delivery of goods and services.
Improvements can almost always be made to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and
improve customer service and satisfaction. Everyone in the organization is constantly on the
lookout for ways to do things better.

Statistical Process Control
Companies can use a variety of tools to identify areas for improvement. A common
approach in manufacturing is called statistical process control. This technique monitors
production quality by testing a sample of output to see whether goods in process are being
made according to predetermined specifications. An example of a statistical process control
method is Six Sigma. A Six-Sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to
perform an operation are free of defects. This percentage equates to only 3.4 defects per
million opportunities.
Assume for a moment that you work for Kellogg’s, the maker of Raisin Bran cereal. You
know that it’s the company’s goal to pack two scoops of raisins in every box of cereal.
How can you test to determine whether this goal is being met? You could use a
statistical process control method called a sampling distribution. On a periodic basis, you
would take a box of cereal off the production line and measure the amount of raisins in the

226

Chapter 9

box. Then you’d record that amount on a control chart designed to compare actual quantities
of raisins with the desired quantity (two scoops). If your chart shows that several samples in a
row are low on raisins, you’d take corrective action.

Outsourcing
PowerSki’s Web site states that “PowerSki International has been founded to bring a
new watercraft, the PowerSki Jetboard, and the engine technology behind it, to market.”221
That goal was reached in May 2003, when the firm emerged from a lengthy design period.
Having already garnered praise for its innovative product, PowerSki was ready to begin massproducing Jetboards. At this juncture, the management team made a strategic decision; rather
than producing Jetboards in-house, they opted for outsourcing: having outside vendors
manufacture the engines, fiberglass hulls, and associated parts. Assembly of the final product
took place in a manufacturing facility owned by All American Power Sports in Moses Lake,
Washington. This decision doesn’t mean that the company relinquished control over quality; in
fact, every component that goes into the PowerSki Jetboard is manufactured to exact
specifications set by PowerSki. One advantage of outsourcing its production function is that
the management team can thereby devote its attention to refining its product design and
designing future products.

Outsourcing in the Manufacturing Sector
Outsourcing has become an increasingly popular option among manufacturers. For one
thing, few companies have either the expertise or the inclination to produce everything needed
to make a product. Today, more firms, like PowerSki, want to specialize in the processes that
they perform best—and outsource the rest. Like PowerSki, they also want to take advantage of
outsourcing by linking up with suppliers located in regions with lower labor costs. Outsourcing
can be local, regional, or even international, and companies can outsource everything from
parts for their products, like automobile manufacturers do, to complete manufacturing of their
products, like Nike and Apple do.

Outsourcing in the Service Sector
Outsourcing is by no means limited to the manufacturing sector. Service providers also
outsource many of their non-core functions. Some universities, for instance, outsource

functions such as food services, maintenance, bookstore sales, printing, grounds keeping,
security, and even residence operations. For example, there are several firms, like RGIS, who
offer inventory services. They will send a team to your company to count your inventory for
you. As RGIS puts it, “Our teams deliver the hands-on help needed to complete a wide variety
of retail projects of all sizes, allowing your team to keep customer service as the number one
priority.”222 Some software developers outsource portions of coding as a cost-saving measure.
If you’ve ever had to get phone or chat assistance on your laptop, there’s a good chance you
spoke with someone in an outsourced call center. The center itself may have even been
located offshore. This kind of arrangement can present unique challenges in quality control as
differences in accents and the use of slang words can sometimes inhibit understanding.
Nevertheless, in this era of globalization, expect the trend towards outsourcing offshore to
continue.

Key Take-Aways
1)

Operations management oversees the process of transforming
resources into goods and services.

1)

During production planning, managers determine how goods will be
produced, where production will take place, and how manufacturing
facilities will be laid out.

2)

In selecting the appropriate production process, managers consider
three basic methods:
a. make-to-order
b. mass production
c. mass customization

3)

In site selection for a company’s manufacturing operations,
managers look for locations that minimize shipping costs, have an
ample supply of skilled workers, provide a favorable community for
workers and their families, offer resources at low cost, and have a
favorable business climate.

4)

Commonly used inventory control methods include just-in-time (JIT)
production, by which materials arrive just in time to enter the
manufacturing process, and material requirements planning (MRP),
a software tool to determine material needs.

Key Take-Aways
5)

Gantt and PERT charts are two common tools used by operations
managers.
d. A Gantt chart helps operations managers determine the status of
projects.
e. PERT charts diagram the activities and time required and identify
the critical path—the sequence of activities that will require the
greatest amount of time.

6)

Service firms provide intangible products that are often customized to
satisfy specific needs. Unlike manufactured goods, many services are
bought and consumed at the same time.

7)

Estimating capacity needs for a service business is more difficult than
for a manufacturer because service providers can’t store their services
for later use.

8)

Many companies deliver quality goods and services by adhering to
principles of total quality management (TQM).

9)

Outsourcing can save companies money by using lower cost,
specialized labor, located domestically or abroad.

Motivation
Motivation refers to an internally generated drive to achieve a goal or follow a particular
course of action. Highly motivated employees focus their efforts on achieving specific goals.
It’s the manager’s job, therefore, to motivate employees—to get them to try to do the best job
they can. Motivated employees call in sick less frequently, are more productive, and are less
likely to convey bad attitudes to customers and co-workers. They also tend to stay in their jobs
longer, reducing turnover and the cost of hiring and training employees. But what motivates
employees to do well? How does a manager encourage employees to show up for work each
day and do a good job? Paying them helps, but many other factors influence a person’s desire
(or lack of it) to excel in the workplace. What are these factors, are they the same for
everybody, and do they change over time? To address these questions, we’ll examine four of
the most influential theories of motivation: hierarchy-of-needs theory, two-factor theory,
expectancy theory, and equity theory.

Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation
Before we begin our discussion of the various theories of motivation, it is important to
establish the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Simply put, intrinsic
motivation comes from within: the enjoyment of a task, the satisfaction of a job well done, and
the desire to achieve are all sources of intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, extrinsic
motivation comes about because of external factors such as a bonus or another form of
reward. Avoiding punishment or a bad outcome can also be a source of extrinsic motivation;
fear, it is said, can be a great motivator.

Hierarchy of Needs Theory
Psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory proposed that we are
motivated by the five initially unmet needs, arranged in the hierarchical order shown in Figure
10.1, which also lists specific examples of each type of need in both the personal and work

spheres of life. Look, for instance, at the list of personal needs in the middle column. At the
bottom are physiological needs (such life-sustaining needs as food and shelter). Working up
the hierarchy we experience safety needs (financial stability, freedom from physical harm),
social needs (the need to belong and have friends), esteem needs (the need for self-respect
and status), and self-actualization needs (the need to reach one’s full potential or achieve
some creative success). There are two key things to remember about Maslow’s model:
1) We must satisfy lower-level needs before we seek to satisfy higher-level needs.
2) Once we’ve satisfied a need, it no longer motivates us; the next higher need takes its
place.

Let’s say, for example, that for a variety of reasons that aren’t your fault, you’re broke,
hungry, and homeless. Because you’ll probably take almost any job that will pay for food and
housing (physiological needs), you go to work repossessing cars. Fortunately, your student
loan finally comes through, and with enough money to feed yourself, you can go back to
school and look for a job that’s not so risky (a safety need). You find a job as a night janitor in
the library, and though you feel secure, you start to feel cut off from your friends, who are
active during daylight hours. You want to work among people, not books (a social need). So
now you join several of your friends selling pizza in the student center. This job improves your
social life, but even though you’re very good at making pizzas, it’s not terribly satisfying. You’d

233

like something that your friends will respect enough to stop teasing you about the pizza job (an
esteem need). So you study hard and land a job as an intern in the governor’s office. On
graduation, you move up through a series of government appointments and eventually run for
state senator. As you’re sworn into office, you realize that you’ve reached your full potential (a
self-actualization need) and you comment to yourself, “It doesn’t get any better than this.”

Needs Theory and the Workplace
What implications does Maslow’s theory have for business managers? There are two
key points: (1) Not all employees are driven by the same needs, and (2) the needs that
motivate individuals can change over time. Managers should consider which needs different
employees are trying to satisfy and should structure rewards and other forms of recognition
accordingly. For example, when you got your first job repossessing cars, you were motivated
by the need for money to buy food. If you’d been given a choice between a raise or a plaque
recognizing your accomplishments, you’d undoubtedly have opted for the money. As a state
senator, by contrast, you may prefer public recognition of work well done (say, election to
higher office) to a pay raise.

Two-Factor Theory
Another psychologist, Frederick Herzberg, set out to determine which work factors
(such as wages, job security, or advancement) made people feel good about their jobs and
which factors made them feel bad about their jobs. He surveyed workers, analyzed the results,
and concluded that to understand employee satisfaction (or dissatisfaction), he had to divide
work factors into two categories:

 Motivation factors. Those factors that are strong contributors to job satisfaction
 Hygiene factors. Those factors that are not strong contributors to satisfaction but that
must be present to meet a worker’s expectations and prevent job dissatisfaction

Chapter 10

Figure 10.2 illustrates Herzberg’s two-factor theory. Note that motivation factors
(such as promotion opportunities) relate to the nature of the work itself and the way the
employee performs it. Hygiene factors (such as physical working conditions) relate to the
environment in which it’s performed.
Figure 10.2: Herzberg’s Two-Factor theory: Poor hygiene factors will increase job
dissatisfaction, while good motivators will increase satisfaction.

Two-Factor Theory and the Workplace
We’ll ask the same question about Herzberg’s model as we did about Maslow’s: What
does it mean for managers? Suppose you’re a senior manager in an accounting firm, where
you supervise a team of accountants, each of whom has been with the firm for five years. How
would you use Herzberg’s model to motivate the employees who report to you? Let’s start with
hygiene factors. Are salaries reasonable? What about working conditions? Does each
accountant have his or her own workspace, or are they crammed into tiny workrooms? Are
they being properly supervised or are they left on their own to sink or swim? If hygiene factors
like these don’t meet employees’ expectations, they may be dissatisfied with their jobs.
Fixing problems related to hygiene factors may alleviate job dissatisfaction, but it won’t
necessarily improve anyone’s job satisfaction. To increase satisfaction (and motivate
someone to perform better), you must address motivation factors. Is the work itself
challenging and stimulating? Do employees receive recognition for jobs well done? Will the
work that an accountant has been assigned help him or her to advance in the firm? According

Chapter 10

235

to Herzberg, motivation requires a twofold approach: eliminating “dissatisfiers” and enhancing
satisfiers.

Expectancy Theory
If you were a manager, wouldn’t you like to know how your employees decide whether
to work hard or goof off? Wouldn’t it be nice to know whether a planned rewards program will
have the desired effect—namely, motivating them to perform better in their jobs? These are the
issues considered by psychologist Victor Vroom in his expectancy theory, which proposes
that employees will work hard to earn rewards that they value and that they consider
“attainable”.
As you can see from Figure 10.3, Vroom argues that an employee will be motivated to
exert a high level of effort to obtain a reward under three conditions – the employee:
1) believes that his or her efforts will result in acceptable performance.
2) believes that acceptable performance will lead to the desired reward.
3) values the reward.

Expectancy Theory and the Workplace
To apply expectancy theory to a real-world situation, let’s analyze an automobileinsurance company with one hundred agents who work from a call center. Assume that the
firm pays a base salary of $2,000 a month, plus a $200 commission on each policy sold
above ten policies a month. In terms of expectancy theory, under what conditions would an
agent be motivated to sell more than ten policies a month?
1) The agent would have to believe that his or her efforts would result in policy sales
(that, in other words, there’s a positive link between effort and performance).
2) The agent would have to be confident that if he or she sold more than ten
policies in a given month, there would indeed be a bonus (a positive link between
performance and reward).
3) The bonus per policy—$200—would have to be of value to the agent.

Reward

Now let’s alter the scenario slightly. Say that the company raises prices, thus making it
harder to sell the policies. How will agents’ motivation be affected? According to expectancy
theory, motivation will suffer. Why? Because agents may be less confident that their efforts will
lead to satisfactory performance. What if the company introduces a policy whereby agents get
bonuses only if buyers don’t cancel policies within ninety days? Now agents may be less
confident that they’ll get bonuses even if they do sell more than ten policies. Motivation will
decrease because the link between performance and reward has been weakened. Finally,
what will happen if bonuses are cut from $200 to $25? Obviously, the reward would be of less
value to agents, and, again, motivation will suffer. The message of expectancy theory, then, is
fairly clear: managers should offer rewards that employees value, set performance levels that
they can reach, and ensure a strong link between performance and reward.

Equity Theory
What if you spent thirty hours working on a class report, did everything you were
supposed to do, and handed in an excellent assignment (in your opinion). Your roommate, on
the other hand, spent about five hours and put everything together at the last minute. You

Chapter 10

know, moreover, that he ignored half the requirements and never even ran his assignment
through a spell-checker. A week later, your teacher returns the reports. You get a C and your
roommate gets a B+. In all likelihood, you’ll feel that you’ve been treated unfairly relative to
your roommate.
Your reaction makes sense according to the equity theory of motivation, which
focuses on our perceptions of how fairly we’re treated relative to others. Applied to the work
environment, this theory proposes that employees analyze their contributions or job inputs
(hours worked, education, experience, work performance) and their rewards or job outcomes
(salary, bonus, promotion, recognition). Then they create a contributions/rewards ratio and
compare it to those of other people. The basis of comparison can be any one of the following:

 Someone in a similar position
 Someone holding a different position in the same organization
 Someone with a similar occupation
 Someone who shares certain characteristics (such as age, education, or level of
experience)

 Oneself at another point in time
Figure 10.4: Equity Theory: Inputs should balance with outcomes

238

Chapter 10

When individuals perceive that the ratio of their contributions to rewards is comparable
to that of others, they perceive that they’re being treated fairly or equitably; when they
perceive that the ratio is out of balance, they perceive inequity. Occasionally, people will
perceive that they’re being treated better than others. More often, however, they conclude that
others are being treated better (and that they themselves are being treated worse). This is
what you concluded when you saw your grade in the previous example. You’ve calculated your
ratio of contributions (hours worked, research and writing skills) to rewards (project grade),
compared it to your roommate’s ratio, and concluded that the two ratios are out of balance.
What will an employee do if he or she perceives an inequity? The individual might try to
bring the ratio into balance, either by decreasing inputs (working fewer hours, not taking on
additional tasks) or by increasing outputs (asking for a raise). If this strategy fails, an employee
might complain to a supervisor, transfer to another job, leave the organization, or rationalize
the situation (e.g., deciding that the situation isn’t so bad after all). Equity theory advises
managers to focus on treating workers fairly, especially in determining compensation, which is,
naturally, a common basis of comparison.

Key Take-Aways
1)

Motivation describes an internally generated drive that propels people
to achieve goals or pursue particular courses of action.

2)

There are four influential theories of motivation: hierarchy-of-needs
theory, two-factor theory, expectancy theory, and equity theory:
a.

Hierarchy-of-needs theory proposes that we’re motivated by five
unmet needs— physiological, safety, social, esteem, and selfactualization— and must satisfy lower- level needs before we seek
to satisfy higher-level needs.

b.

Two-factor theory divides work factors into motivation
factors (those that are strong contributors to job satisfaction)
and hygiene factors (those that, though not big contributors to
satisfaction, must be present to prevent job dissatisfaction).

c.

Expectancy theory proposes that employees work harder to
obtain a reward when they value the reward, believe that their
efforts will result in acceptable performance, and believe that
acceptable performance will lead to a desired outcome or reward.

d.

Equity theory focuses on our perceptions of how fairly we’re
treated relative to others. This theory proposes that employees
create rewards ratios that they compare to those of others and will
be less motivated when they perceive an imbalance in treatment.

The Grounds of a Great Work Environment
Howard Schultz has vivid memories of his father slumped on the couch with his leg in a
cast.223 The ankle would heal, but his father had lost another job—this time as a driver for a
diaper service. It was a crummy job; still, it put food on the table, and if his father couldn’t work,
there wouldn’t be any money. Howard was seven, but he understood the gravity of the
situation, particularly because his mother was seven months pregnant, and the family had no
insurance.
This was just one of the many setbacks that

Figure 21.1: Starbucks founder
Howard Schultz

plagued Schultz’s father throughout his life—an
honest, hard-working man frustrated by a system that
wasn’t designed to cater to the needs of common
workers. He’d held a series of blue-collar jobs (cab
driver, truck driver, factory worker), sometimes holding
two or three at a time. Despite his willingness to work,
he never earned enough money to move his family out
of Brooklyn’s federally-subsidized housing projects.
Schultz’s father died never having found fulfillment in
his work life—or even a meaningful job. It was the
saddest day of Howard’s life.
As a kid, did Schultz ever imagine that one day
he’d be the founder and chairman of Starbucks Coffee
Company? Of course not. But he did decide that if he
was ever in a position to make a difference in the lives of people like his father, he’d do what
he could. Remembering his father’s struggles and disappointments, Schultz has tried to make
Starbucks the kind of company where he wished his father had worked. “Without even a high
school diploma,” Schultz admits, “my father probably could never have been an executive. But
if he had landed a job in one of our stores or roasting plants, he wouldn’t have quit in
frustration because the company didn’t value him. He would have had good health benefits,

Chapter 11

stock options, and an atmosphere in which his suggestions or complaints would receive a
prompt, respectful response.”224
Schultz is motivated by both personal and business considerations: “When employees
have self-esteem and self-respect,” he argues, “they can contribute so much more: to their
company, to their family, to the world.”225 His commitment to his employees is embedded in
Starbuck’s mission statement, whose first objective is to “provide a great work environment
and treat each other with respect and dignity.”226 Those working at Starbucks are called
partners because Schultz believes working for his company is not just a job, it’s a passion. 227

Human Resource Management
Employees at Starbucks are vital to the company’s success. They are its public face,
and every dollar of sales passes through their hands.228 According to Howard Schultz, they
can make or break the company. If a customer has a positive interaction with an employee, the
customer will come back. If an encounter is negative, the customer is probably gone for good.
That’s why it’s crucial for Starbucks to recruit and hire the right people, train them properly,
motivate them to do their best, and encourage them to stay with the company. Thus, the
company works to provide satisfying jobs,
a positive work environment, appropriate

work schedules, and fair compensation
and benefits. These activities are part of
Starbucks’s strategy to deploy human
resources in order to gain competitive
advantage. The process is called human
resource management (HRM), which
consists of all actions that an
organization takes to attract, develop,
and retain quality employees. Each of
these activities is complex. Attracting
talented employees involves the recruitment of qualified candidates and the selection of those

243

who best fit the organization’s needs. Development encompasses both new-employee
orientation and the training and development of current workers. Retaining good employees
means motivating them to excel, appraising their performance, compensating them
appropriately, and doing what’s possible to keep them.

Human Resource Planning
How does Starbucks make sure that its worldwide retail locations are staffed with just
the right number of committed employees? How does Norwegian Cruise Lines make certain
that when the Norwegian Dawn pulls out of New York harbor, it has a complete, fully trained
crew on board to feed, entertain, and care for its passengers? Managing these tasks is a
matter of strategic human resource planning—the process of developing a plan for
satisfying an organization’s human resources (HR) needs.
A strategic HR plan lays out the steps that an organization will take to ensure that it has
the right number of employees with the right skills in the right places at the right times. HR
managers begin by analyzing the company’s mission, objectives, and strategies. Starbucks’s
objectives, for example, include the desire to “develop enthusiastically satisfied customers” as
well as to foster an environment in which employees treat both customers and each other with
respect.229 Thus, the firm’s HR managers look for people who are “adaptable, self-motivated,
passionate, creative team members.”230 The main goal of Norwegian Cruise Lines—to lavish
passengers with personal attention—determines not only the type of employee desired (one
with exceptionally good customer-relation skills and a strong work ethic) but also the number
needed (one for every two passengers on the Norwegian Dawn).231

Job Analysis
To develop an HR plan, HR managers must be knowledgeable about the jobs that the
organization needs performed. They organize information about a given job by performing a
job analysis to identify the tasks, responsibilities, and skills that it entails, as well as the
knowledge and abilities needed to perform it. Managers also use the information collected for
the job analysis to prepare two documents:

244

Chapter 11

 A job description, which lists the duties and responsibilities of a position
 A job specification, which lists the qualifications—skills, knowledge, and
abilities— needed to perform the job

HR Supply and Demand Forecasting
Once they’ve analyzed the jobs within the organization, HR managers must forecast
future hiring (or firing) needs. This is the three-step process summarized below.
Figure 11.3: How to Forecast Hiring (and Firing) Needs

Starbucks, for instance, might find that it needs three hundred new employees to work
at stores scheduled to open in the next few months. Disney might determine that it needs two
thousand new cast members to handle an anticipated surge in visitors. The Norwegian Dawn
might be short two dozen restaurant workers because of an unexpected increase in
reservations.
After calculating the disparity between supply and future demand, HR managers must
draw up plans for bringing the two numbers into balance. If the demand for labor is going to
outstrip the supply, they may hire more workers, encourage current workers to put in extra
hours, subcontract work to other suppliers, or introduce labor-saving initiatives. If the supply is
greater than the demand, they may deal with overstaffing by not replacing workers who leave,
encouraging early retirements, laying off workers, or (as a last resort) firing workers.

Recruiting Qualified Employees
Armed with information on the number of new employees to be hired and the types of
positions to be filled, the HR manager then develops a strategy for recruiting potential
employees. Recruiting is the process of identifying suitable candidates and encouraging them
to apply for openings in the organization.
Before going any further, we should point out that in recruiting and hiring, managers
must comply with antidiscrimination laws; violations can have legal consequences.
Discrimination occurs when a person is treated unfairly on the basis of a characteristic
unrelated to ability. Under federal law, it’s illegal to discriminate in recruiting and hiring on the
basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. (The same rules apply to
other employment activities, such as promoting, compensating, and firing.) 232 The Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces a number of federal employment laws,
including the following:



Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment
discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Sexual
harassment is also a violation of Title VII.



The Equal Pay Act of 1963, which protects both women and men who do
substantially equal work from sex-based pay discrimination.



The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1964, which protects individuals
who are forty or older.



Title I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits
employment discrimination against individuals with disabilities.233

Where to Find Candidates
The first step in recruiting is to find qualified candidates. Where do you look for them,
and how do you decide whether they’re qualified? Companies must assess not only the ability
of a candidate to perform the duties of a job, but also whether he or she is a good “fit” for the
company-- i.e., how well the candidate’s values and interpersonal style match the company’s
values and culture.

Chapter 11

Internal versus External Recruiting
Where do you find people who satisfy so many criteria? Basically, you can look in two
places: inside and outside your own organization. Both options have pluses and minuses.
Hiring internally sends a positive signal to employees that they can move up in the company—
a strong motivation tool and a reward for good performance. In addition, because an internal
candidate is a known quantity, it’s easier to predict his or her success in a new position.
Finally, it’s cheaper to recruit internally. On the other hand, you’ll probably have to fill the
promoted employee’s position. Going outside gives you an opportunity to bring fresh ideas and
skills into the company. In any case, it’s often the only alternative, especially if no one inside
the company has just the right combination of skills and experiences. Entry-level jobs are
usually filled from the outside.
How to Find Candidates
Whether you search inside or outside the organization, you need to publicize the
opening. If you’re looking internally in a small organization, you can alert employees informally.
In larger organizations, HR managers generally post openings on bulletin boards (often online)
or announce them in newsletters. They can also seek direct recommendations from various
supervisors.
Recruiting people from outside is more complicated. It’s a lot like marketing a product to
buyers: in effect, you’re marketing the virtues of working for your company. Starbucks uses the
following outlets to advertise openings:

 A dedicated section of the corporate web site (“Job Center,” which lists
openings, provides information about the Starbucks experience, and facilitates
the submission of online applications)

 College campus recruiting (holding on-campus interviews and information
sessions and participating in career fairs)

 Internships designed to identify future talent among college students
 Announcements on employment web sites like Monster.com, Vault.com,
Glassdoor.com, and SimplyHired.com

 Newspaper classified ads

 Local job fairs
 In-store recruiting posters
 Informative “business cards” for distribution to customers234
When asked what it takes to

Figure11.4: Students talking to a recruiter at a
college campus job fair

attract the best people, Starbucks’s
senior executive Dave Olsen replied,
“Everything matters.” Everything
Starbucks does as a company bears on
its ability to attract talent. Accordingly,
everyone is responsible for recruiting, not
just HR specialists. In fact, the best
source of quality applicants is often the
company’s own labor force.235
The Selection Process

Recruiting gets people to apply for positions, but once you’ve received applications, you
still have to select the best candidate—another complicated process.
The selection process entails gathering information on candidates, evaluating their
qualifications, and choosing the right one. At the very least, the process can be timeconsuming—particularly when you’re filling a high-level position—and often involves several
members of an organization.
Let’s examine the selection process more closely by describing the steps that you’d
take to become a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).236 Most business
students don’t generally aspire to become FBI agents, but the FBI is quite interested in
business graduates—especially if you have a major in accounting or finance. With one of these
backgrounds, you’ll be given priority in hiring. Why?
Unfortunately, there’s a lot of white-collar crime that needs to be investigated, and
people who know how to follow the money are well suited for the task.

Chapter 11

Application
The first step in a new graduate being hired as an FBI accountant is applying for the job.
Make sure you meet the minimum qualifications they advertise. To provide factual information
on your education and work background, you’ll submit an application, which the FBI will use as
an initial screening tool.
Employment Tests
Next comes a battery of tests (a lot more than you’d take in applying for an everyday
business position). Like most organizations, the FBI tests candidates on the skills and
knowledge entailed by the job. Unlike most businesses, however, the FBI will also measure
your aptitude, evaluate your personality, and assess your writing ability. You’ll have to take a
polygraph (lie-detector) test to determine the truthfulness of the information you’ve provided,
uncover the extent of any drug use, and disclose potential security problems.
Interview
If you pass all these tests (with sufficiently high marks), you’ll be granted an interview. It
serves the same purpose as it does for business recruiters: it allows the FBI to learn more
about you and gives you a chance to learn more about your prospective employer and your
possible future in the organization. The FBI conducts structured interviews—a series of
standard questions. You’re judged on both your answers and your ability to communicate
orally.
Physical Exam and Reference Checks
Let’s be positive and say you passed the interview. What’s next? You still have to pass
a rigorous physical examination (including a drug test), as well as background and reference
checks. Given its mission, the FBI sets all these hurdles a little higher than the average
employer. Most businesses will ask you to take a physical exam, but you probably won’t have
to meet the fitness standards set by the FBI. Likewise, many businesses check references to
verify that applicants haven’t lied about (or exaggerated) their education and work experience.
The FBI goes to great lengths to ensure that candidates are suitable for law-enforcement work.

Final Decision
The last stage in the process is out of your control. Will you be hired or not? This
decision is made by one or more people who work for the prospective employer. For a
business, the decision maker is generally the line manager who oversees the position being
filled. At the FBI, the decision is made by a team at FBI headquarters.
Contingent Workers
Though most people hold permanent, full-time positions, there’s a growing number of
individuals who work at temporary or part-time jobs. Many of these are contingent workers
hired to supplement a company’s permanent workforce. Most of them are independent
contractors, consultants, or freelancers who are paid by the firms that hire them. Others are
on-call workers who work only when needed, such as substitute teachers. Still others are
temporary workers (or “temps”) who are employed and paid by outside agencies or contract
firms that charge fees to client companies.
The Positives and Negatives of Temp Work
The use of contingent workers provides companies with a number of benefits. Because
they can be hired and fired easily, employers can better control labor costs. When things are
busy, they can add temps, and when business is slow, they can release unneeded workers.
Temps are often cheaper than permanent workers, particularly because they rarely receive
costly benefits. Employers can also bring in people with specialized skills and talents to work
on special projects without entering into long-term employment relationships. Finally,
companies can “try out” temps: if someone does well, the company can offer permanent
employment; if the fit is less than perfect, the employer can easily terminate the relationship.
There are downsides to the use of contingent workers, including increased training costs and
decreased loyalty to the company. Also, many employers believe that because temps are
usually less committed to company goals than permanent workers, productivity suffers.

Developing Employees
Because companies can’t survive unless employees do their jobs well, it makes
economic sense to train them and develop their skills. This type of support begins when an
individual enters the organization and continues as long as he or she stays there.

New-Employee Orientation
Have you ever started your first day at a new job feeling upbeat and optimistic only to
walk out at the end of the day thinking that maybe you’ve taken the wrong job? If this happens
too often, your employer may need to revise its approach to orientation—the way it introduces
new employees to the organization and their jobs. Starting a new job is a little like beginning
college; at the outset, you may be experiencing any of the following feelings:

 Somewhat nervous but enthusiastic
 Eager to impress but not wanting to attract too much attention
 Interested in learning but fearful of being overwhelmed with information
 Hoping to fit in and worried about looking new or inexperienced237
The employer who understands how common such feelings are is more likely not only
to help newcomers get over them but also to avoid the pitfalls often associated with newemployee orientation:

 Failing to have a workspace set up for you
 Ignoring you or failing to supervise you
 Neglecting to introduce you to coworkers
 Swamping you with facts about the company238
A good employer will take things slowly, providing you with information about the
company and your job on a need-to-know basis while making you feel as comfortable as

Training and Development
It would be nice if employees came with all the skills they need to do their jobs. It would
also be nice if job requirements stayed the same: once you’ve learned how to do a job, you’d
know how to do it forever. In reality, new employees must be trained; moreover, as they grow
in their jobs or as their jobs change, they’ll need additional training. Unfortunately, training is
costly and time-consuming.
How costly? Training magazine reported that businesses spent over $55 billion on
training in 2013.239 At Darden Restaurants, the parent company to restaurants such as Olive
Garden and Red Lobster, training focuses on diversity skills. 240 What’s the payoff? Why are
such companies willing to spend so much money on their employees? Darden has been
recognized by Fortune magazine as a “Diversity Champion,” ranking it as one of the Top 20
employers on their list of diverse workforces.241 At Booz Allen Hamilton, consultants specialize
in finding innovative solutions to client problems, and their employer makes sure that they’re
up-to-date on all the new technologies by maintaining a “technology petting zoo” at its training
headquarters. It’s called a “petting zoo” because employees get to see, touch, and interact with
new and emerging technologies. For example, a Washington Post reporter visiting the “petting
zoo” in 2007 saw fabric that could instantly harden if struck by a knife or bullet, and “smart”
clothing that could monitor a wearer’s health or environment.242
At Booz Allen Hamilton’s technology “petting zoo,” employees are receiving off-the-job
training. This approach allows them to focus on learning without the distractions that would
occur in the office. More common, however, is informal on-the-job training, which may be
supplemented with formal training programs. This is the method, for example, by which you’d
move up from mere coffee maker to a full-fledged “barista” if you worked at Starbucks.243
You’d begin by reading a large spiral book (titled Starbucks University) on the responsibilities
of the barista, pass a series of tests on the reading, then get hands-on experience in making
drinks, mastering one at a time.244 Doing more complex jobs in business will likely require even
more training than is required to be a barista.

Diversity in the Workplace
The makeup of the U.S. workforce has changed dramatically over the past 50 years. In
the 1950s, more than 60 percent was composed of white males.245 Today’s workforce reflects
the broad range of differences in the population—differences in gender, race, ethnicity, age,
physical ability, religion, education, and lifestyle. As you can see in Figure 11.5, more women
and minorities have entered the workforce, and white males now make up only 36 percent of
the workforce.246

Most companies today strive for diverse workforces. HR managers work hard to recruit,
hire, develop, and retain a diverse workforce. In part, these efforts are motivated by legal
concerns: discrimination in recruiting, hiring, advancement, and firing is illegal under federal
law and is prosecuted by the EEOC.247 Companies that violate antidiscrimination laws are
subject to severe financial penalties and also risk reputational damage. In November 2004, for
example, the EEOC charged that recruiting policies at Abercrombie & Fitch, a national chain of
retail clothing stores, had discriminated against minority and female job applicants between
1999 and 2004. The EEOC alleged that A&F had hired a disproportionate number of white
salespeople, placed minorities and women in less visible positions, and promoted a virtually
all-white image in its marketing efforts. Six days after the EEOC filed a lawsuit, the company
settled the case at a cost of $50 million, but the negative publicity may hamper both

mere compliance with legal
standards. It even goes beyond
commitment to ethical standards. It’s
good business. People with diverse
backgrounds bring fresh points of
view that can be invaluable in
generating ideas and solving
problems. In addition, they can be

the key to connecting with an ethnically diverse customer base. If a large percentage of your
customers are Hispanic, it might make sense to have a Hispanic marketing manager. In short,
capitalizing on the benefits of a diverse workforce means that employers should view
differences as assets rather than liabilities.

What Makes a Great Place to Work?
Every year, the Great Places to Work Institute analyzes comments from thousands of
employees and compiles a list of “The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America®,” which is
published in Fortune magazine. Having compiled its list for more than twenty years, the
institute concludes that the defining characteristic of a great company to work for is trust
between managers and employees. Employees overwhelmingly say that they want to work at
a place where employees “trust the people they work for, have pride in what they do, and enjoy
the people they work with.”249 They report that they’re motivated to perform well because
they’re challenged, respected, treated fairly, and appreciated. They take pride in what they do,
are made to feel that they make a difference, and are given opportunities for advancement. 250
The most effective motivators, it would seem, are closely aligned with Maslow’s higher-level
needs and Herzberg’s motivating factors. The top ten companies are listed in Figure 11.7.

Job Redesign
The average employee spends more than
two thousand hours a year at work. If the job is
tedious, unpleasant, or otherwise unfulfilling, the
employee probably won’t be motivated to perform
at a very high level. Many companies practice a
policy of job redesign to make jobs more
interesting and challenging. Common strategies
include job rotation, job enlargement, and job
enrichment.

Job Rotation
Specialization promotes efficiency because
workers get very good at doing particular tasks.
The drawback is the tedium of repeating the same
task day in and day out. The practice of job
rotation allows employees to rotate from one job

to another on a systematic basis, often but not
necessarily cycling back to their original tasks. A computer maker, for example, might rotate a
technician into the sales department to increase the employee’s awareness of customer needs
and to give the employee a broader understanding of the company’s goals and operations. A
hotel might rotate an accounting clerk to the check- in desk for a few hours each day to add
variety to the daily workload. Through job rotation, employees develop new skills and gain
experience that increases their value to the company. So great is the benefit of this practice
that many companies have established rotational training programs that include scheduled
rotations during the first 2-3 years of employment. Companies benefit because cross-trained
employees can fill in for absentees, thus providing greater flexibility in scheduling, offer fresh
ideas on work practices, and become promotion-ready more quickly.

Job Enlargement
Instead of a job in which you performed just one or two tasks, wouldn’t you prefer a job
that gave you many different tasks? In theory, you’d be less bored and more highly motivated if
you had a chance at job enlargement—the policy of enhancing a job by adding tasks at similar
skill levels. The job of sales clerk, for example, might be expanded to include gift-wrapping and
packaging items for shipment. The additional duties would add variety without entailing higher
skill levels.

Job Enrichment
Merely expanding a job by adding similar tasks won’t necessarily “enrich” it by making it
more challenging and rewarding. Job enrichment is the practice of adding tasks that increase
both responsibility and opportunity for growth. It provides the kinds of benefits that, according
to Maslow and Herzberg, contribute to job satisfaction: stimulating work, sense of personal
achievement, self-esteem, recognition, and a chance to reach your potential.
Consider, for example, the evolving role of support staff in the contemporary office.
Today, employees who used to be called “secretaries” assume many duties previously in the
domain of management, such as project coordination and public relations. Information
technology has enriched their jobs because they can now apply such skills as word
processing, desktop publishing, creating spreadsheets, and managing databases. That’s why
we now use a term such as administrative assistant instead of secretary. 251

Work/Life Quality
Building a career requires a substantial commitment in time and energy, and most
people find that they aren’t left with much time for non-work activities. Fortunately, many
organizations recognize the need to help employees strike a balance between their work and
home lives.252 By helping employees combine satisfying careers and fulfilling personal lives,
companies tend to end up with a happier, less-stressed, and more productive workforce. The
financial benefits include lower absenteeism, turnover, and health care costs.

Alternative Work Arrangements
The accounting firm KPMG, which has made the list of the “100 Best Companies for
Working Mothers” for nineteen years,253 is committed to promoting a balance between its
employees’ work and personal lives. KPMG offers a variety of work arrangements designed to
accommodate different employee needs and provide scheduling flexibility.254

Flextime
Employers who provide for flextime set guidelines that allow employees to designate
starting and quitting times. Guidelines, for example, might specify that all employees must
work eight hours a day (with an hour for lunch) and that four of those hours must be between
10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Thus, you could come in at 7 a.m. and leave at 4 p.m., while coworkers
arrive at 10 a.m. and leave at 7 p.m. With permission you could even choose to work from 8
a.m to 2 p.m., take two hours for lunch, and then work from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.

Compressed Workweeks
Rather than work eight hours a day for five days a week, you might elect to earn a
three-day weekend by working ten hours a day for four days a week.

Job Sharing
Under job sharing, two people share one full-time position, splitting the salary and
benefits of the position as each handles half the job. Often they arrange their schedules to
include at least an hour of shared time during which they can communicate about the job.

Telecommuting
Telecommuting means that you regularly work from home (or from some other non-work
location). You’re connected to the office by computer, fax, and phone. You save on commuting
time, enjoy more flexible work hours, and have more opportunity to spend time with your
family. A study of 5,500 IBM employees (one-fifth of whom telecommute) found that those who
worked at home not only had a better balance between work and home life but also were more
highly motivated and less likely to leave the organization. 255
Though it’s hard to count telecommuters accurately, Global Workplace Analytics
estimates that, in 2016, “at least 3.7 million people (2.8 percent of the workforce) work from

257

home at least half the time.”256 Telecommuting isn’t for everyone. Working at home means that
you have to discipline yourself to avoid distractions, such as TV, personal phone calls, and
home chores and also not be impacted by feeling isolated from the social interaction in the
workplace.

Family-Friendly Programs
In addition to alternative work arrangements, many employers, including KPMG, offer
programs and benefits designed to help employees meet family and home obligations while
maintaining busy careers. KPMG offers each of the following benefits.257

Dependent Care
Caring for dependents—young children and elderly parents—is of utmost importance to
some employees, but combining dependent-care responsibilities with a busy job can be
particularly difficult. KPMG provides on-site child care during tax season (when employees are
especially busy) and offers emergency backup dependent care all year round, either at a
provider’s facility or in the employee’s home. To get referrals or information, employees can
call KPMG’s LifeWorks Resource and Referral Service.
KPMG is by no means unique in this respect: more than 7 percent of U.S. companies
maintained on-site day care in 2012,258 and 17 percent of all U.S. companies offered child-care
resources or referral services.259

Paid Parental Leave
The United States is one of only two countries in the world that does not guarantee paid
leave to new mothers (or fathers), although California, Rhode Island and New Jersey are
implementing state programs, and many employers offer paid parental leave as an employee
benefit.260 Any KPMG employee (whether male or female) who becomes a parent can take two
weeks of paid leave. New mothers may also get time off through short-term disability benefits.

Caring for Yourself
Like many companies, KPMG allows employees to aggregate all paid days off and use
them in any way they want. In other words, instead of getting, say, ten sick days, five personal
days, and fifteen vacation days, you get a total of thirty days to use for anything. If you’re

having personal problems, you can contact the Employee Assistance Program. If staying fit
makes you happier and more productive, you can take out a discount membership at one of
more than nine thousand health clubs. In fact, many employers, like North Carolina software
company SAS, now have on-site fitness centers for employee use.261

Unmarried without Children
You’ve undoubtedly noticed by now that many programs for balancing work and
personal lives target married people, particularly those with children. Single individuals also
have trouble striking a satisfactory balance between work and non-work activities, but many
single workers feel that they aren’t getting equal consideration from employers.262 They report
that they’re often expected to work longer hours, travel more, and take on difficult assignments
to compensate for married employees with family commitments.
Needless to say, requiring singles to take on additional responsibilities can make it
harder for them to balance their work and personal lives. It’s harder to plan and keep personal
commitments while meeting heavy work responsibilities. Frustration can lead to increased
stress and job dissatisfaction. In several studies of stress in the accounting profession,
unmarried workers reported higher levels of stress than any other group, including married
people with children.263
With singles, as with married people, companies can reap substantial benefits from
programs that help employees balance their work and non-work lives. PepsiCo, for example,
offers a “concierge service,” which maintains a dry cleaner, travel agency, convenience store,
and fitness center on the premises of its national office in Somers, New York. 264 Single
employees seem to find these services helpful, but what they value most of all is control over
their time. In particular, they want predictable schedules that allow them to plan social and
personal activities. They don’t want employers assuming that being single means that they can
change plans at the last minute. It’s often more difficult for singles to deal with last-minute
changes because, unlike married coworkers, they don’t have the at-home support structure to
handle such tasks as tending to elderly parents or caring for pets.

Compensation and Benefits
Though paychecks and benefits packages aren’t the only reasons why people work,
they do matter. Competitive pay and benefits also help organizations attract and retain
qualified employees. Companies that pay their employees more than their competitors
generally have lower turnover. Consider, for example, The Container Store, which regularly
appears on Fortune magazine’s list of “The 100 Best Companies to Work For.”265 The retail
chain staffs its stores with fewer employees than its competitors but pays them more—in some
cases, three times the industry average for retail workers. This strategy allows the company to
attract extremely talented workers who, moreover, aren’t likely to leave the company. Low
turnover is particularly valuable in the retail industry because it depends on service-oriented
personnel to generate repeat business. In addition to salary and wages, compensation
packages often include other financial incentives, such as bonuses and profit-sharing plans, as
well as benefits, such as medical insurance, vacation time, sick leave, and retirement
accounts.

Wages and Salaries
The largest, and most important, component of a compensation package is the payment
of wages or salary. If you’re paid according to the number of hours you work, you’re earning
wages. Counter personnel at McDonald’s, for instance, get wages, which are determined by
multiplying an employee’s hourly wage rate by the number of hours worked during the pay
period. On the other hand, if you’re paid for fulfilling the responsibilities of a position—
regardless of the number of hours required to do it— you’re earning a salary. The McDonald’s
manager gets a salary for overseeing the operations of the restaurant. He or she is expected
to work as long as it takes to get the job done, without any adjustment in compensation.

Piecework and Commissions
Sometimes it makes more sense to pay workers according to the quantity of product
that they produce or sell. Byrd’s Seafood, a crab-processing plant in Crisfield, Maryland, pays
workers on piecework: workers’ pay is based on the amount of crabmeat that’s picked from

260

Chapter 11

recently cooked crabs. (A good picker can produce fifteen pounds of crabmeat an hour and
earn about $100 a day.)266 If you’re working on commission, you’re probably getting paid a
percentage of the total dollar amount you sell. If you were a sales representative for an
insurance company, like The Hartford, you’d get a certain amount of money for each
automobile or homeowner policy you sold.267

Incentive Programs
In addition to regular paychecks, many people receive financial rewards based on
performance, whether their own, their employer’s, or both. Other incentive programs designed
to reward employees for good performance include bonus plans and stock options.

Bonus Plans
Texas Instruments’ (TI) year-end bonuses—annual income given in addition to salary—
are based on individual and company-wide performance. If the company has a profitable year,
and if you contributed to that success, you’ll get a bonus.268 If the company doesn’t do well,
you may be out of luck - regardless of your personal performance, you might not receive a
bonus.
Bonus plans have become quite common, and the range of employees eligible for
bonuses has widened in recent years. In the past, bonus plans were usually reserved for
managers above a certain level. Today, companies have realized the value of extending plans
to include employees at virtually every level. The magnitude of bonuses still favors those at the
top. High-ranking officers often get bonuses ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent of their
salaries. Upper-level managers may get from 15 percent to 25 percent and middle managers
from 10 percent to 15 percent. At lower levels, employees may expect bonuses from 3 percent
to 5 percent of their annual compensation.269

Profit-Sharing Plans
Delta Airlines270 and General Motors271 both have profit-sharing arrangements with
employees. Today, about 40% of all U.S. companies offer some type of profit-sharing
program.272

Chapter 11

Download this book for free at:
http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

261

TI’s plan is also pretty generous—as long as the company has a good year. Here’s how
it works. An employee’s profit share depends on the company’s operating profit for the year. If
profits from operations reach 10 percent of sales, the employee gets a bonus worth 2 percent
of his or her salary. In 2011, TI’s operating profit was 22 percent, and employee bonuses were
7.9 percent of salary. But if operating profits are below 10 percent, nobody gets anything. 273

Stock-Option Plans
The TI compensation plan also gives employees the right to buy shares of company
stock at a 15% discount four times a year.274 So, if the price of the stock goes up, the
employee benefits. Say, for example, that the stock was selling for $30 a share when the
option was granted in 2007. The employee would be entitled to buy shares at a price of
$25.50, earning them an immediate 15% gain in value. Any increase in share price would add
to that gain.275
At TI, stock options are used as an incentive to attract and retain top people.276
Starbucks, by contrast, isn’t nearly as selective in awarding stock options. At Starbucks, all
employees can earn “Bean Stock”—the Starbucks employee stock-option plan. Both full- and
part-time employees get Starbucks shares based on their earnings and their time with the
company. If the company does well and its stock goes up, employees make a profit. CEO
Howard Schultz believes that Bean Stock pays off because employees are rewarded when the
company does well, they have a stronger incentive to add value to the company (and so drive
up its stock price). Starbucks has a video explaining their employee stock option program on
this webpage.277

Benefits
Another major component of an employee’s compensation package is benefits—
compensation other than salaries, hourly wages, or financial incentives. Types of benefits
include the following:

 Legally required benefits (Social Security and Medicare, unemployment
insurance, workers’ compensation)

 Paid time off (vacations, holidays, sick leave)

262

Chapter 11

 Insurance (health benefits, life insurance, disability insurance)
 Retirement benefits
The cost of providing benefits is staggering. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, it costs an average employer about 30 percent of a worker’s salary to provide the
same worker with benefits. If you include pay for time not worked (while on vacation or sick
and so on), the percentage increases to 37 percent. The most money goes for paid time off
(6.9% of salary costs), health care (8.1%), and retirement benefits (3.8%).278
Some workers receive only the benefits required by law while part-timers often receive
no benefits at all.279 Again, Starbucks is generous in offering benefits. The company provides
benefits even to the part-timers who make up two-thirds of the company’s workforce; anyone
working at least twenty hours a week is eligible to participate in group medical coverage. 280

Performance Appraisal
Employees generally want their managers to tell them three things: what they should be
doing, how well they’re doing it, and how they can improve their performance. Good managers
address these issues on an ongoing basis. On a semiannual or annual basis, they also
conduct formal performance appraisals to discuss and evaluate employees’ work performance.

The Basic Three-Step Process
Appraisal systems vary both by organization and by the level of the employee being
evaluated, but as you can see in Figure 11.8, it’s generally a three-step process:
1)

Before managers can measure performance, they must set goals and
performance expectations and specify the criteria (such as quality of work,
quantity of work, dependability, initiative) that they’ll use to measure
performance.

2)

At the end of a specified time period, managers complete written evaluations
that rate employee performance according to the predetermined criteria.

Chapter 11

Download this book for free at:
http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

263

3)

Managers then meet with each employee to discuss the evaluation. Jointly, they
suggest ways in which the employee can improve performance, which might
include further training and development.

It sounds fairly simple, but why do so many managers report that, except for firing
people, giving performance appraisals is their least favorite task?281 To get some perspective
on this question, we’ll look at performance appraisals from both sides, explaining the benefits
and identifying potential problems with some of the most common practices.

Figure 11.8: The three steps in the performance appraisal process.

Among other benefits, formal appraisals provide the following:



An opportunity for managers and employees to discuss an employee’s
performance and to set future goals and performance expectations



A chance to identify and discuss appropriate training and career-development
opportunities for an employee



Formal documentation of the evaluation that can be used for salary, promotion,
demotion, or dismissal purposes282

As for disadvantages, most stem from the fact that appraisals are often used to
determine salaries for the upcoming year. Consequently, meetings to discuss performance
tend to take on an entirely different dimension: the manager may appear judgmental (rather

Chapter 11

than supportive), and the employee may get defensive. This adversarial atmosphere can make
many managers not only uncomfortable with the task but also less likely to give honest
feedback. (They may give higher marks in order to avoid delving into critical evaluations.) HR
professionals disagree about whether performance appraisals should be linked to pay
increases. Some experts argue that the connection eliminates the manager’s opportunity to
use the appraisal to improve an employee’s performance. Others maintain that it increases
employee satisfaction with the process and distributes raises on the basis of effort and
results.283

360-Degree and Upward Feedback
Instead of being evaluated by one person, how would you like to be evaluated by
several people—not only those above you in the organization but those below and beside you?
The approach is called 360-degree feedback, and the purpose is to ensure that employees
(mostly managers) get feedback from all directions—from supervisors, reporting subordinates,
coworkers, and even customers. If it’s conducted correctly, this technique furnishes managers
with a range of insights into their performance in a number of roles.
Some experts, however, regard the 360-degree approach as too cumbersome. An
alternative technique, called upward feedback, requires only the manager’s subordinates to
provide feedback. Computer maker Dell uses this approach as part of its managerdevelopment plan. Every year, forty thousand Dell employees complete a survey in which they
rate their supervisors on a number of dimensions, such as practicing ethical business
principles and providing support in balancing work and personal life. Dell uses survey results
for development purposes only, not as direct input into decisions on pay increases or
promotions.284

Retaining Valuable Employees
When a valued employee quits, the loss to the employer can be serious. Not only will
the firm incur substantial costs to recruit and train a replacement, but it also may suffer
temporary declines in productivity and lower morale among remaining employees who have to
take on heavier workloads. Given the negative impact of turnover—the permanent separation
of an employee from a company—most organizations do whatever they can to retain qualified

265

employees. Compensation plays a key role in this effort: companies that don’t offer competitive
compensation packages tend to lose employees. Other factors also come into play, such as
training and development, as well as helping employees achieve a satisfying work/non-work
balance. In the following sections, we’ll look at a few other strategies for reducing turnover and
increasing productivity.285

Creating a Positive Work Environment
Employees who are happy at work are more productive, provide better customer
service, and are more likely to stay with the company. A study conducted by Sears, for
instance, found a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and employee attitudes
on ten different issues: a 5 percent improvement in employee attitudes results in a 1.3 percent
increase in customer satisfaction and a 0.5 percent increase in revenue.286

The Employee-Friendly Workplace
What sort of things improve employee attitudes? The 12,000 employees of software
maker SAS Institute fall into the category of “happy workers.” They choose the furniture and
equipment in their offices, eat subsidized meals at one of three on-site restaurants, and enjoy
other amenities like a 77,000 square-foot fitness center. They also have job security: no one’s
ever been laid off because of an economic downturn. The employee-friendly work environment
helps SAS employees focus on their jobs and contribute to the attainment of company
goals.287 Not surprisingly, it also results in very low 3 percent turnover.

Recognizing Employee Contributions
Thanking people for work done well is a powerful motivator. People who feel
appreciated are more likely to stay with a company than those who don’t.288 While a personal
thank-you is always helpful, many companies also have formal programs for identifying and
rewarding good performers. The Container Store rewards employee accomplishments in a
variety of ways. For example, employees with 20 years of service are given a “dream trip”—
one employee went on a seven day Hawaiian cruise.289 The company is known for its
supportive environment and in 2016 celebrated its seventeenth year on Fortune’s 100 Best
Companies to Work For®.290

Involving Employees in Decision Making
Companies have found that involving employees in decisions saves money, makes
workers feel better about their jobs, and reduces turnover. Some have found that it pays to
take their advice. When General Motors asked workers for ideas on improving manufacturing
operations, management was deluged with more than forty-four thousand suggestions during
one quarter. Implementing a few of them cut production time on certain vehicles by 15 percent
and resulted in sizable savings.291
Similarly, in 2001, Edward Jones, a personal investment company, faced a difficult
situation during the stock-market downturn. Costs had to be cut, and laying off employees was
one option. Instead, however, the company turned to its workforce for solutions. As a group,
employees identified cost savings of more than $38 million. At the same time, the company
convinced experienced employees to stay with it by assuring them that they’d have a role in
managing it.292

Why People Quit
As important as such initiatives can be, one bad boss can spoil everything. The way a
person is treated by his or her boss may be the primary factor in determining whether an
employee stays or goes. People who have quit their jobs cite the following behavior by
superiors:



Making unreasonable work demands



Failing to be clear about what’s expected of subordinates

Holding managers accountable for excessive turnover can help alleviate the “bad-boss”
problem, at least in the long run. In any case, whenever an employee quits, it’s a good idea for
someone—other than the individual’s immediate supervisor—to conduct an exit interview to
find out why. Knowing why people are quitting gives an organization the opportunity to correct
problems that are causing high turnover rates.

Involuntary Termination
Before we leave this section, we should say a word or two about termination—getting
fired. Though turnover—voluntary separations—can create problems for employers, they’re not
nearly as devastating as the effects of involuntary termination on employees. Losing your job is
what psychologists call a “significant life change,” and it’s high on the list of “stressful life
events” regardless of the circumstances. Sometimes, employers lay off workers because
revenues are down and they must resort to downsizing—to cutting costs by eliminating jobs.
Sometimes a particular job is being phased out, and sometimes an employee has simply failed
to meet performance requirements.

Employment at Will
Is it possible for you to get fired even if you’re doing a good job and there’s no economic
justification for your being laid off? In some cases, yes—especially if you’re not working under
a contract. Without a formal contract, you’re considered to be employed at will, which means
that both you and your employer have the right to terminate the employment relationship at
any time. You can quit whenever you want, but your employer can also fire you whenever they
want.
Fortunately for employees, over the past several decades, the courts have made
several decisions that created exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine.294 Since
managers generally prefer to avoid the expense of fighting wrongful discharge claims in court,
many no longer fire employees at will. A good practice in managing terminations is to maintain
written documentation so that employers can demonstrate just cause when terminating an
employee. If it’s a case of poor performance, the employee would be warned in advance that
his or her current level of performance could result in termination and then be permitted an
opportunity to improve performance. When termination is necessary, communication should be
handled in a private conversation, with the manager explaining precisely why the action is
being taken.

Key Take-Aways
1)

The process of human resource management consists of
actions that an organization takes to attract, develop, and retain
quality employees.

2)

Human resource managers engage in strategic human
resource planning—the process of developing a plan for
satisfying the organization’s human resource needs

3)

The HR manager forecasts future hiring needs and begins the
recruiting process to fill those needs.

4)

In recruiting and hiring, managers must comply with
antidiscrimination laws enforced by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC). They cannot treat people
unfairly on the basis of a characteristic unrelated to ability, such
as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability.

5)

HR managers also oversee employee training, from the first
orientation to continuing on- or off-the-job training.

6)

Attracting a diverse workforce goes beyond legal compliance
and ethical commitments, because a diverse group of employees
can offer perspectives that may be valuable in generating ideas,
solving problems, and connecting with an ethnically diverse
customer base.

Employees are motivated to perform well when they’re
challenged, respected, treated fairly, and appreciated.

8)

Some other factors that contribute to employee satisfaction
include job redesign to make jobs more interesting and
challenging, job rotation, which allows employees to rotate from
one job to another, job enlargement, which enhances a job by
adding tasks at similar skill levels, and job enrichment, which
adds tasks that increase both responsibility and opportunity for
growth.

9)

Many organizations recognize the need to help employees strike
a balance between their work and home lives and offer a variety
of work arrangements to accommodate

different employee

needs, such as flextime (flexible scheduling), job sharing (when
two people share a job), and telecommuting (working from
outside the office).

10) Compensation includes pay and benefits. Workers who are paid
by the hour earn wages, while those who are paid to fulfill the
responsibilities of the job earn salaries. Some people receive
commissions based on sales or are paid for output, based on a
piecework approach.

11) In addition employees can may receive year-end bonuses,
participate in profit-sharing plans, or receive stock options.

12) Managers conduct performance appraisals to evaluate work
performance.

13) Turnover is the permanent separation of an employee from a
company and may happen if an employee is unsatisfied with their
job, or because the organization is not satisfied with the
employee. Sometimes, firms lay off workers, or downsize, to cut

Labor Unions
As we saw in Chapter 10, Maslow believed that individuals are motivated to satisfy five
levels of unmet needs (physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization). From this
perspective, employees hope that full-time work will satisfy at least the two lowest-level needs:
they want to be paid wages that are sufficient for them to feed, house, and clothe themselves
and their families, and they expect safe working conditions and hope for some degree of job
security.
Organizations also have needs: they need to earn profits that will satisfy their owners.
They need to keep other stakeholders satisfied as well, which can cost money. Consider a
metal-plating business that uses dangerous chemicals in its manufacturing processes; wastewater treatment is essential – and expensive. Sometimes, the needs of employees and
employers are consistent: the organization can pay decent wages and provide workers with
safe working conditions and job security while still making a satisfactory profit. At other times,
there is a conflict—real, perceived, or a little bit of both—between the needs of employees and
those of employers. In such cases, workers may be motivated to join a labor union—an
organized group of workers that bargains with employers to improve its members’ pay, job
security, and working conditions.
Figure 12.1 on the next page graphs labor-union density—union membership as a
percentage of payrolls—in the United States from 1930 to 2015. As you can see, there’s been
a steady decline since the middle part of the 1950s. Recently, only about 11 percent of U.S.
workers have taken steps to belong to unions.295 Only union membership among public
workers (those employed by federal, state, and local governments, such as teachers, police,
and firefighters) has grown. In the 1940s, 10 percent of public workers and 34 percent of those
in the private sector belonged to unions. Today, this has reversed: 36 percent of public
workers and 7 percent of those in the private sector are union members.296
Why the decline in private sector unionization? Many factors come into play. The
relatively weak economy has reduced the number of workers who have the confidence to go

through a union organizing campaign; many workers are content just to have jobs and do not
want to be seen as “rocking the boat.” In addition, the United States has shifted from a
manufacturing-based economy characterized by large, historically unionized companies to a
service-based economy made up of many small firms that are harder to unionize. 297

Union Structure
Unions have a pyramidal structure much like that of large corporations. At the bottom
are locals that serve workers in a particular geographical area. Certain members are
designated as shop stewards to serve as go-betweens in disputes between workers and
supervisors. Locals are usually organized into national unions that assist with local contract
negotiations, organize new locals, negotiate contracts for entire industries, and lobby
government bodies on issues of importance to organized labor. In turn, national unions may be
linked by a labor federation, such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of

Chapter 12

Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), which provides assistance to member unions and serves
as a principal political organ for organized labor.

Collective Bargaining
In a non-union environment, the employer makes largely unilateral, i.e., one-sided
decisions on issues affecting its labor force, such as salary and benefits. Typically, employees
are in no position to bargain for better deals. At the same time, however, employers have a
vested interest in treating workers fairly. As we saw in Chapter 11, a reputation for treating
employees well, for example, is a key factor in attracting talented people. Most employers want
to avoid the costs involved in managing a unionized workforce; as a result, many offer
generous pay and benefit packages in the hopes of keeping their workers happy – and ununionized.
The process of setting pay and benefit levels is a lot different in a unionized
environment. Union workers operate on a contract which usually covers some agreed-upon,
multi-year period. When a given contract period begins to approach expiration, union
representatives determine with members what they want in terms of salary increases, benefits,
working conditions, and job security in their next contract. Union officials then tell the employer
what its workers want and ask what they’re willing to offer. When there’s a discrepancy
between what workers want and what management is willing to give—as there usually is—
union officials serve as negotiators on behalf of their workforce, with the objective of extracting
the best package of salary, benefits, and other conditions possible. The process of settling
differences and establishing mutually agreeable conditions under which employees will work is
called collective bargaining.

The Negotiation Process
Negotiations start when each side states its position and presents its demands. As in
most negotiations, these opening demands simply stake out starting positions. Both parties
usually expect some give-and-take and realize that the final agreement will fall somewhere
between the two positions. If everything goes smoothly, a tentative agreement can be reached
and then voted on by union members. If they accept the agreement, the process is complete
and a contract is put into place to govern labor-management relations for a stated period. If

Chapter 12

275

workers reject the agreement, negotiators from both sides must go back to the bargaining
table.

Mediation and Arbitration
If negotiations stall, the sides may call in outsiders. One option for engaging outside
parties is called mediation, under which an impartial third party assesses the situation and
makes recommendations for reaching an agreement. A mediator’s advice can be accepted or
rejected by either side. If mediation does not result in an agreement, because one or both
sides are unwilling to accept the decision of the third party, they may opt instead for
arbitration, under which the third party studies the situation and arrives at a binding
agreement. The key difference between mediation and arbitration is the word “binding” –
whatever the third party says goes, because both the union and management have agreed to
accept the decision of the third party as a condition of entering into the arbitration process.

Grievance Procedures
Another difference between union and non-union environments is the handling of
grievances—worker complaints on contract-related matters. When non-union workers feel
that they’ve been treated unfairly, they can take up the matter with supervisors, who may or
may not satisfy their complaints. When unionized workers have complaints (such as being
asked to work more hours than stipulated under their contract), they can call on union
representatives to resolve the problem, in conjunction with supervisory personnel, who are part
of company management. If the outcome isn’t satisfactory to the worker, the union can choose
to take the problem to higher-level management on his or her behalf. If there is still no
resolution, the union may submit the grievance to an arbitrator.
At times, labor and management can’t resolve their differences through collective
bargaining or formal grievance procedures. When this happens, each side may resort to a
variety of tactics to win support for its positions and force the opposition to agree to its
demands.

Union Tactics
Unions have several options at their disposal to pressure company management into
accepting the terms and conditions union members are demanding. The tactics available to the
union include striking, picketing, and boycotting. When they go on strike, workers walk away
from their jobs and refuse to return until the issue at hand has been resolved. As
undergraduates at Yale discovered when they arrived on campus in fall 2003, the effects of a
strike can engulf parties other than employers and strikers: with four thousand dining room
workers on strike, students had to scramble to find food at local minimarkets. The strike—the
eighth at the school since 1968—lasted twenty-three days, and in the end, the workers got
what they wanted: better pension plans.298
Though a strike sends a strong

Figure 12.2: Chicago teachers picketing
during a strike in 2012

message to management, it also has
consequences for workers, who don’t get paid
when they’re on strike. Unions often ease the
financial pressure on strikers by providing
cash payments, which are funded from the
dues members pay to the unions. It is
important to note that some unionized workers
may not have the right to strike. For example,
strikes by federal employees, such as airtraffic controllers, can be declared illegal if
they jeopardize the public interest.
When you see workers parading with signs outside a factory or an office building (or
even a school), they’re probably using the tactic known as picketing (see Figure 12.2). The
purpose of picketing is informative—to tell people that a workforce is on strike or to publicize
some management practice that is unacceptable to the union. In addition, because other union
workers typically won’t cross picket lines, marchers can sometimes interrupt the daily activities
of the targeted organization. In April 2001, faculty at the University of Hawaii, unhappy about
salaries, went on strike for thirteen days. Initially, many students cheerfully headed for the

beach, but before long, many more—particularly graduating seniors—began to worry about
finishing the semester with the credits they needed to keep their lives on schedule.299
The final tactic available to unions is boycotting, in which union workers refuse to buy a
company’s products and try to get other people to follow suit. The tactic is often used by the
AFL-CIO, which maintains a national “Don’t Buy or Patronize” boycott list. In 2003, for
example, at the request of two affiliates, the Actor’s Equity Association and the American
Federation of Musicians, the AFL-CIO added the road show of the Broadway musical Miss
Saigon to the list. Why? The unions objected to the use of non-union performers who worked
for particularly low wages and to the use of a “virtual orchestra,” an electronic apparatus that
can replace a live orchestra with software-generated orchestral accompaniment.300

Management Tactics
Management doesn’t typically sit by passively, especially if the company has a position
to defend or a message to get out. One available tactic is the lockout—closing the workplace
to workers—though it’s rarely used because it’s legal only when unionized workers pose a
credible threat to the employer’s financial viability. If you are a fan of professional basketball,
you may remember the NBA lockout in 2011 (older fans may remember a similar scenario that
took place in 1999) which took place because of a dispute regarding the division of revenues
and the structure of the salary cap.
Lockout tactics were also used in the 2011 labor dispute between the National Football
League (NFL) and the National Football League Players Association when club owners and
players failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Prior to the 2011 season, the owners
imposed a lockout, which prevented the players from practicing in team training facilities. Both
sides had their demands: the players wanted a greater percentage of the revenues, which the
owners were against. The owners wanted the players to play two additional regular season
games, which the players were against. With the season drawing closer, an agreement was
finally reached in July 2011 bringing the 130-day lockout to an end and ensuring that the 2011
football season would begin on time.301
Another management tactic is replacing striking workers with strikebreakers—nonunion workers who are willing to cross picket lines to replace strikers. Though the law prohibits

companies from permanently replacing striking workers, it’s often possible for a company to
get a court injunction that allows it to bring in replacement workers. For example, the NFL
employed replacement referees in 2012, a move which led to a number of very questionable
calls on the field.302

Why Managers Often Resist Unionization Efforts
No union organizing campaign ever

started with the premise that by unionizing,
benefit programs. To the contrary, unions
approach prospective members with promises like
higher pay, better health insurance, and more
vacation time. Not surprisingly, then, business
managers resist unions because they generally
add to the cost of doing business. Higher costs
can be addressed in several ways. Managers
could accept lower profits, though such an
outcome is unlikely given that
owners/shareholders benefit from higher profits. They could raise prices and pass the higher
costs along to customers, but doing so could hurt their competitiveness in the marketplace.
Alternatively. they could find other ways to offset the increase in costs, but since managers are
already supposed to be paying attention to costs, finding offsets can be quite difficult.
Another reason managers sometimes resist unionization is that unions often attempt to
negotiate work rules that are to the benefit of their members. Business people who have
worked in union environments have often complained of the lack of flexibility and the difficulty
unions sometimes create in dealing with poor performing union employees. The grievance
process can sometimes be long, cumbersome, and costly to administer.
Some companies find working with unions to be so unpleasant that they decide to
voluntarily increase pay and benefits to preempt unions in advertising these benefits.

The Future of Unions
As we noted earlier, union membership in the United States has been declining for
some time. So will membership continue to decline causing unions to lose even more power?
The AFL-CIO is optimistic about union membership, pointing out recent gains in membership
among women and immigrants, as well as health care workers, graduate students, and
professionals.303
Convincing workers to unionize is still more difficult than it used to be and could become
even harder in the future. Given their resistance to being unionized, employers have
developed strategies for dissuading workers from unionizing—in particular, tactics for
withholding job security. If unionization threatens higher costs for wages and benefits,
management can resort to part-time or contract workers. They can also outsource work,
eliminating jobs entirely. Many employers are now investing in technology designed to reduce
the amount of human labor needed to produce goods or offer services. While it is impossible to
predict the future, it is likely that unions and managers will remain adversaries for the
foreseeable future.

A Robot with Attitude

Figure 43.1: Mark Tilden and his creation, Robosapien
Mark Tilden used to build robots for NASA that ended up being destroyed on Mars, but
after seven years of watching the results of his work meet violent ends thirty-six million miles
from home, he decided to specialize in robots for earthlings. He left the space world for the toy
world and teamed up with Wow Wee Toys Ltd. to create “Robosapien,” an intelligent robot with
an attitude.304 The fourteen-inch-tall robot, which is operated by remote control, has great
moves. In addition to walking forward, backward, and turning, he dances, raps, and gives
karate chops. He can pick up small objects and even fling them across the room, and he does
everything while grunting, belching, and emitting other “bodily” sounds.
Robosapien gave Wow Wee Toys a good head start in the toy robot market: in the first
five months, more than 1.5 million Robosapiens were sold.305 The company expanded the line

What does Robosapien have to do with marketing? The answer is fairly simple: though

wouldn’t be going anywhere without the marketing expertise of Wow Wee. In this chapter, we’ll
look at the ways in which marketing converts product ideas like Robosapien into commercial
successes.

What Is Marketing?
When you consider the functional areas of business—accounting, finance,
management, marketing, and operations—marketing is the one you probably know the most
about. After all, as a consumer and target of all sorts of advertising messages, you’ve been on
the receiving end of marketing initiatives for most of your life. What you probably don’t
appreciate, however, is the extent to which marketing focuses on providing value to the
customer. According to the American Marketing Association, “Marketing is the activity, set of
institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings
that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.”307
In other words, marketing isn’t just advertising and selling. It includes everything that
organizations do to satisfy customer needs:

 Coming up with a product and defining its features and benefits
 Setting its price
 Identifying its target market
 Making potential customers aware of it
 Getting people to buy it
 Delivering it to people who buy it
 Managing relationships with customers after it has been delivered

Think about a typical business—a local movie theater, for example. It’s easy to see how
the person who decides what movies to show is involved in marketing: he or she selects the
product to be sold. It’s even easier to see how the person who puts ads in the newspaper
works in marketing: he or she is in charge of advertising—making people aware of the product
and getting them to buy it. What about the ticket seller and the person behind the counter who
gets the popcorn and soda or the projectionist? Are they marketing the business? Absolutely.
The purpose of every job in the theater is satisfying customer needs, and as we’ve seen,
identifying and satisfying customer needs is what marketing is all about. Marketing is a team
effort involving everyone in the organization.
If everyone is responsible for marketing, can the average organization do without an
official marketing department? Not necessarily: most organizations have marketing
departments in which individuals are actively involved in some marketing-related activity—
product design and development, pricing, promotion, sales, and distribution. As specialists in
identifying and satisfying customer needs, members of the marketing department manage—
plan, organize, lead, and control—the organization’s overall marketing efforts.

The Marketing Concept
Figure 13.2 is designed to remind you that to achieve company profitability goals, you
need to start with three things:
1.

Find out what customers or potential customers need.

2.

Develop products to meet those needs.

3.

Engage the entire organization in efforts to satisfy customers.

Figure 13.2: The marketing concept leads to company profit

Chapter 13

At the same time, you need to achieve organizational goals, such as profitability and growth.
This basic philosophy—satisfying customer needs while meeting organizational goals—is
called the marketing concept, and when it’s effectively applied, it guides all of an
organization’s marketing activities.
The marketing concept puts the customer first: as your most important goal, satisfying
the customer must be the goal of everyone in the organization. But this doesn’t mean that you
ignore the bottom line; if you want to survive and grow, you need to make some profit. What
you’re looking for is the proper balance between the commitments to customer satisfaction and
company survival. Consider the case of Medtronic, a manufacturer of medical devices, such as
pacemakers and defibrillators. The company boasts more than 50 percent of the market in
cardiac devices and is considered the industry standard setter.308 Everyone in the organization
understands that defects are intolerable in products that are designed to keep people alive.
Thus, committing employees to the goal of zero defects is vital to both Medtronic’s customer
base and its bottom line. “A single quality issue,” explains CEO Arthur D. Collins Jr., “can
deep-six a business.”309

Selecting a Target Market
Businesses earn profits by selling goods or providing services. It would be nice if
everybody in the marketplace was interested in your product, but if you tried to sell it to
everybody, you’d probably spread your resources too thin. You need to identify a specific
group of consumers who should be particularly interested in your product, who would have
access to it, and who have the means to buy it. This group represents your target market, and
you need to aim your marketing efforts at its members.

Identifying Your Market
How do marketers identify target markets? First, they usually identify the overall market
for their product—the individuals or organizations that need a product and are able to buy it.
This market can include either or both of two groups:
1) A consumer market—buyers who want the product for personal use
2) An industrial market—buyers who want the product for use in making other
products

You might focus on only one market or both. A farmer, for example, might sell
blueberries to individuals on the consumer market and, on the industrial market, to bakeries
that will use them to make muffins and pies.

Segmenting the Market
The next step in identifying a target market is to divide the entire market into smaller
portions, or market segments—groups of potential customers with common characteristics
that influence their buying decisions. You can use a number of characteristics to narrow a
market. Let’s look at some of the most useful categories in detail.
Demographic Segmentation
Demographic segmentation divides the market into groups based on such variables
as age, marital status, gender, ethnic background, income, occupation, and education.
Age, for example, will be of interest to marketers who develop products for children,
retailers who cater to teenagers, colleges that recruit students, and assisted-living facilities that
promote services among the elderly. Lifetime Television for Women targets female viewers,
while Telemundo networks targets Hispanics. When Hyundai offers recent college graduates a
$400 bonus towards leasing or buying a new Hyundai, the company’s marketers are
segmenting the market according to education level.310
Geographic Segmentation
Geographic segmentation—dividing a
market according to such variables as climate,

region, and population density (urban, suburban,
small-town, or rural)—is also quite common.
Climate is crucial for many products: try selling
snow shovels in Hawaii or above-ground pools in
Alaska. Consumer tastes also vary by region.
That’s why McDonald’s caters to regional
preferences, offering a breakfast of Spam and
rice in Hawaii, 311 tacos in Arizona, and lobster
rolls in Massachusetts.312 Outside the United

States, menus diverge even more widely (you can get seaweed burgers or, if you prefer,
seasoned seaweed fries in Japan).313
Likewise, differences between urban and suburban life can influence product selection.
For example, it’s a hassle to parallel park on crowded city streets. Thus, Toyota engineers
have developed a product especially for city dwellers. The Japanese version of the Prius,
Toyota’s hybrid gas-electric car, can automatically parallel park itself. Using computer software
and a rear-mounted camera, the parking system measures the spot, turns the steering wheel,
and swings the car into the space (making the driver—who just sits there—look like a master
of parking skills).314 After its success in the Japanese market, the self-parking feature was
brought to the United States.
Behavioral Segmentation
Dividing consumers by such variables as attitude toward the product, user status, or
usage rate is called behavioral segmentation. Companies selling technology-based products
might segment the market according to different levels of receptiveness to technology. They
could rely on a segmentation scale developed by Forrester Research that divides consumers
into two camps: technology optimists, who embrace new technology, and technology
pessimists, who are indifferent, anxious, or downright hostile when it comes to technology. 315
Some companies segment consumers according to user status, distinguishing among
nonusers, potential users, first-time users, and regular users of a product. Depending on the
product, they can then target specific groups, such as first-time users. Credit-card companies
use this approach when they offer frequent flyer miles to potential customers in order to induce
them to get their card. Once they start using it, they’ll probably be segmented according to
usage. “Heavy users” who pay their bills on time will likely get increased credit lines.
Psychographic Segmentation
Psychographic segmentation classifies consumers on the basis of individual lifestyles
as they’re reflected in people’s interests, activities, attitudes, and values. Do you live an active
life and love the outdoors? If so, you may be a potential buyer of hiking or camping equipment
or apparel. If you’re a risk taker, you might catch the attention of a gambling casino. The
possibilities are limited only by the imagination.

Clustering Segments
Typically, marketers determine target markets by combining, or “clustering,”
segmenting criteria. What characteristics does Starbucks look for in marketing its products?
Three demographic variables come to mind: age, geography, and income. Buyers are likely to
be males and females ranging in age from about twenty-five to forty (although college
students, aged eighteen to twenty-four, are moving up in importance). Geography is a factor as
customers tend to live or work in cities or upscale suburban areas. Those with relatively high
incomes are willing to pay a premium for Starbucks specialty coffee and so income—a
socioeconomic factor—is also important.

The Marketing Mix
After identifying a target market, your next step is developing and implementing a
marketing program designed to reach it. As Figure 13.4 shows, this program involves a
combination of tools called the marketing mix, often referred to as the “four P’s” of marketing:
1) Developing a product that meets the needs of the target market
2) Setting a price for the product
3) Distributing the product—getting it to a place where customers can buy it
4) Promoting the product—informing potential buyers about it

Developing a Product
The development of Robosapien was a bit unusual for a company that was already
active in its market.316 Generally, product ideas come from people within the company who
understand its customers’ needs. Internal engineers are then challenged to design the product.
In the case of Robosapien, the creator, Mark Tilden, had conceived and designed the product
before joining Wow Wee Toys. The company gave him the opportunity to develop the product
for commercial purposes, and Tilden was brought on board to oversee the development of
Robosapien into a product that satisfied Wow Wee’s commercial needs.
Robosapien is not a “kid’s toy,” though kids certainly love its playful personality. It’s a
home-entertainment product that appeals to a broad audience—children, young adults, older
adults, and even the elderly. It’s a big gift item, and it has developed a following of techies and
hackers who take it apart, tinker with it, and even retrofit it with such features as cameras and
ice skates.

Conducting Marketing Research
Before settling on a strategy for Robosapien, the marketers at Wow Wee did some
homework. First, to zero in on their target market, they had to find out what various people
thought of the product. More precisely, they needed answers to questions like the following:

 Who are our potential customers?
 What do they like about Robosapien? What would they change?
 How much are they willing to pay for it?
 Where will they expect to buy it?
 How can we distinguish it from competing products?
 Will enough people buy Robosapien to return a reasonable profit for the
company?

The last question would be left up to Wow Wee management, but, given the size of the
investment needed to bring Robosapien to market, Wow Wee couldn’t afford to make the
wrong decision. Ultimately, the company was able to make an informed decision because its
marketing team provided answers to key questions through marketing research—the process
of collecting and analyzing the data that are relevant to a specific marketing situation. This
data had to be collected in a systematic way. Market research seeks two types of data:
1) Marketers generally begin by looking at secondary data—information already
collected, whether by the company or by others, that pertains to the target
market.
2) With secondary data in hand, they’re prepared to collect primary data—newly
collected information that addresses specific questions.
Secondary data can come from inside or outside the organization. Internally available
data includes sales reports and other information on customers. External data can come from
a number of sources. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, posts demographic information
on American households (such as age, income, education, and number of members), both for
the country as a whole and for specific geographic areas.
Population data helped Wow Wee estimate the size of its potential U.S. target market.
Other secondary data helped the firm assess the size of foreign markets in regions around the
world, such as Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific Rim. This data
helped position the company to sell Robosapien in eighty-five countries, including Canada,
England, France, Germany, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Japan.
Using secondary data that is already available (and free) is a lot easier than collecting
your own information. Unfortunately, however, secondary data didn’t answer all the questions
that Wow Wee was asking in this particular situation. To get these answers, the marketing
team had to conduct primary research, working directly with members of their target market.
First they had to decide exactly what they needed to know, then determine who to ask and
what methods would be most effective in gathering the information.
We know what they wanted to know—we’ve already listed example questions. As for
whom to talk to, they randomly selected representatives from their target market. There is a
variety of tools for collecting information from these people, each of which has its advantages
292

Chapter 13

and disadvantages. To understand the marketing-research process fully, we need to describe
the most common of these tools:



Surveys. Sometimes marketers mail questionnaires to members of the target
market. The process is time consuming and the response rate generally low.
Online surveys are easier to answer and so get better response rates than other
approaches.



Personal interviews. Though time consuming, personal interviews not only let
you talk with real people but also let you demonstrate the product. You can also
clarify answers and ask open-ended questions.



Focus groups. With a focus group, you can bring together a group of individuals
(perhaps six to ten) and ask them questions. A trained moderator can explain the
purpose of the group and lead the discussion. If sessions are run effectively, you
can come away with valuable information about customer responses to both your
product and your marketing strategy.

Wow Wee used focus groups and personal interviews because both approaches had
the advantage of allowing people to interact with Robosapien. In particular, focus-group
sessions provided valuable opinions about the product, proposed pricing, distribution methods,
and promotion strategies.
Researching your target market is necessary before you launch a new product, but the
benefits of marketing research don’t extend merely to brand-new products. Companies also
use it when they’re deciding whether or not to refine an existing product or develop a new
marketing strategy for an existing product. Kellogg’s, for example, conducted online surveys to
get responses to a variation on its Pop-Tarts brand—namely, Pop-Tarts filled with a mixture of
traditional fruit filling and yogurt. Marketers had picked out four possible names for the product
and wanted to know which one kids and mothers liked best. They also wanted to know what
they thought of the product and its packaging. Both mothers and kids liked the new Pop-Tarts
(though for different reasons) and its packaging, and the winning name for the product
launched in the spring of 2011 was “Pop-Tarts Yogurt Blasts.” The online survey of 175
mothers and their children was conducted in one weekend by an outside marketing research
group.317

Branding
Armed with positive feedback from their research efforts, the Wow Wee team was ready
for the next step: informing buyers—both consumers and retailers—about their product. They
needed a brand—some word, letter, sound, or symbol that would differentiate their product
from similar products on the market. They chose the brand name Robosapien, hoping that
people would get the connection between homo sapiens (the human species) and Robosapien
(the company’s coinage for its new robot “species”). To prevent other companies from coming
out with their own “Robosapiens,” they took out a trademark: a symbol, word, or words legally
registered or established by use as representing a company or product. Trademarking requires
registering the name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Though this approach—
giving a unique brand name to a particular product—is a bit unusual, it isn’t unprecedented.
Mattel, for example, established a separate brand for Barbie, and Anheuser-Busch sells beer
under the brand name Budweiser. Note, however, that the more common approach, which is
taken by such companies as Microsoft, Dell, and Apple, calls for marketing all the products
made by a company under the company’s brand name.

Branding Strategies
Companies can adopt one of three major strategies for branding a product:
1)

With private branding (or private labeling), a company makes a product and
sells it to a retailer who in turn resells it under its own name. A soft-drink maker,
for example, might make cola for Wal-Mart to sell as its Sam’s Choice Cola.

2)

With generic branding, the maker attaches no branding information to a product
except a description of its contents. Customers are often given a choice between
a brand-name prescription drug or a cheaper generic drug with the same
formula.

3)

With manufacturer branding, a company sells one or more products under its
own brand names. Adopting a multiproduct-branding approach, it sells all its
products under one brand name (generally the company name). Using a
multibranding approach, it will assign different brand names to different
products covering different segments of the market. Automakers generally use

Chapter 13

multibranding. For example, the Volkwagen group of brands also includes Audi,
Bentley, and even Lamborghini.
Branding is used in hotels to allow chains (Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton) to offer hotel brands
that meet various customers’ travel needs while still maintaining their loyalty to the chain. The
same customer who would choose an Extended Stay hotel with a full kitchen when on a long
term assignment might stay at a convention hotel when attending a trade show and then stay
in a resort property when traveling with their family. By segmenting different types of hotel
locations, amenities, room sizes and décor, hotel chains can meet the needs of a wide variety
of travelers. In the past decade “soft” branding has become common to allow unique hotels to
take advantage of being part of a chain reservation system and loyalty program. For example,
Marriott has over 100 affiliated independent hotels in its Autograph Collection.318

Loyalty programs are heavily used in the hospitality industry, especially airlines and
hotels, as part of their Customer Relationship Management programs. Loyalty programs are
often targeted to high value business travelers with less price sensitivity. They achieve loyalty
status and perks while traveling as well as earning points to use for personal travel rewards.
Once a loyalty program member obtains elite status with significant associated perks such as
guaranteed room availability, airport club lounge access, etc., the customer is much less likely
to use other brands.

Building Brand Equity
Wow Wee went with the multibranding approach, deciding to market Robosapien under
the robot’s own brand name. Was this a good choice? The answer would depend, at least in
part, on how well the product sells. Another consideration is the impact on Wow Wee’s other
brands. If Robosapien fared poorly, its failure would not reflect badly on Wow Wee’s other
products. On the other hand, if customers liked Robosapien, they would have no reason to
associate it with other Wow Wee products. In this case, Wow Wee wouldn’t gain much from its
brand equity—any added value generated by favorable consumer experiences with
Robosapien. To get a better idea of how valuable brand equity is, think for a moment about the
effect of the name Dell on a product. When you have a positive experience with a Dell
product—say, a laptop or a printer—you come away with a positive opinion of the entire Dell
product line and will probably buy more Dell products. Over time, you may even develop brand
loyalty: you may prefer—or even insist on—Dell products. Not surprisingly, brand loyalty can
be extremely valuable to a company. Because of customer loyalty, Apple’s brand tops
Interbrand’s Best Global Brands ranking with a value of over $170 billion. Google’s brand is
valued at $120 billion, the Coca-Cola brand is estimated at more than $78 billion, and
Microsoft and IBM round out the top five, with
brands valued at over $65 billion each.319

Figure 13.6: Robosapien in its package

Packaging and Labeling
Packaging can influence a consumer’s
decision to buy a product or pass it up. Packaging
gives customers a glimpse of the product, and it
should be designed to attract their attention, with
consideration given to color choice, style of
lettering, and many other details. Labeling not only
identifies the product but also provides information
on the package contents: who made it and where
or what risks are associated with it (such as being
unsuitable for small children).
How has Wow Wee handled the packaging
and labeling of Robosapien? The robot is fourteen inches tall, and is also fairly heavy (about

296

Download this book for free at:
http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

Chapter 13

seven pounds), and because it’s made out of plastic and has movable parts, it’s breakable.
The easiest, and least expensive, way of packaging it would be to put it in a square box of
heavy cardboard and pad it with Styrofoam. This arrangement would not only protect the
product from damage during shipping but also make the package easy to store. However, it
would also eliminate any customer contact with the product inside the box (such as seeing
what it looks like). Wow Wee, therefore, packages Robosapien in a container that is curved to
his shape and has a clear plastic front that allows people to see the whole robot. Why did Wow
Wee go to this much trouble and expense? Like so many makers of so many products, it has
to market the product while it’s still in the box.
Meanwhile, the labeling on the package details some of the robot’s attributes. The name
is highlighted in big letters above the descriptive tagline “A fusion of technology and
personality.” On the sides and back of the package are pictures of the robot in action with such
captions as “Dynamic Robotics with Attitude” and “Awesome Sounds, Robo-Speech & Lights.”
These colorful descriptions are conceived to entice the consumer to make a purchase because
its product features will satisfy some need or want.
Packaging can serve many purposes. The Robosapien package attracts attention to the
product’s features. For other products, packaging serves a more functional purpose. Nabisco
packages some of its snacks— Oreos, Chips Ahoy, and Lorna Doone’s—in “100 Calorie
Packs.” The packaging makes life simpler for people who are keeping track of calories.

Place
A great deal is involved in getting a product to the place in which it is ultimately sold. If
you’re a fast food retailer, for example, you’ll want your restaurants to be in high-traffic areas to
maximize your potential business. If your business is selling beer, you’ll want it to be offered in
bars, restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, and even stadiums. Placing a product in
each of these locations requires substantial negotiations with the owners of the space, and
often the payment of slotting fees, an allowance paid by the manufacturer to secure space on
store shelves.
Retailers are marketing intermediaries that sell products to the eventual consumer.
Without retailers, companies would have a much more difficult time selling directly to individual

consumers, no doubt at a substantially higher cost. The most common types of retailers are
summarized in Figure 13.7 below. You will likely recognize many of the examples provided. It
is important to note that many retailers do not fit neatly into only one category. For example,
WalMart, which began as a discount store, has added groceries to many of its outlets, also
placing it in competition with supermarkets.

Promoting a Product
Your promotion mix—the means by which you communicate with customers—may
include advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, and publicity. These are all tools for
telling people about your product and persuading potential customers to buy it. Before deciding
on an appropriate promotional strategy, you should consider a few questions:

 What’s the main purpose of the promotion?
 What is my target market?
 Which product features should I emphasize?
 How much can I afford to invest in a promotion campaign?
 How do my competitors promote their products?
To promote a product, you need to imprint a clear image of it in the minds of your target
audience. What do you think of, for instance, when you hear “Ritz-Carlton”? What about “Motel
6”? They’re both hotel chains, that have been quite successful in the hospitality industry, but
they project very different images to appeal to different clienteles. The differences are evident
in their promotions. The Ritz-Carlton web site describes “luxury hotels” and promises that the
chain provides “the finest personal service and facilities throughout the world.” 320 Motel 6, by
contrast, characterizes its facilities as “discount hotels” and assures you that you’ll pay “the
lowest price of any national chain.”321

Promotional Tools
We’ll now examine each of the elements that can go into the promotion mix—
advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, and publicity. Then we’ll see how Wow Wee
incorporated them into a promotion mix to create a demand for Robosapien.

personal communication designed to
create an awareness of a product or
company. Ads are everywhere—in print
media (such as newspapers,
magazines, the Yellow Pages), on
billboards, in broadcast media (radio
and TV), and on the Internet. It’s hard to
escape the constant barrage of
advertising messages; it’s estimated
that the average consumer is
confronted by about 5,000 ad messages

each day (compared with about 500 ads a day in the 1970s).322 For this very reason, ironically,
ads aren’t as effective as they used to be. Because we’ve learned to tune them out, companies
now have to come up with innovative ways to get through to potential customers. A New York
Times article323 claims that “anywhere the eye can see, it’s likely to see an ad.” Subway
turnstiles are plastered with ads for GEICO auto insurance, Chinese food containers are
decorated with ads for Continental Airways, and parking meters display ads for Campbell’s
Soup324 Advertising is still the most prevalent form of promotion.
The choice of advertising media depends on your product, target audience, and
budget. A travel agency selling spring-break getaways to college students might post flyers on
campus bulletin boards or run ads in campus newspapers. The cofounders of Nantucket
Nectars found radio ads particularly effective. Rather than pay professionals, they produced
their own ads themselves.325 As unprofessional as this might sound, the ads worked, and the
business grew.

Personal Selling
Personal selling refers to one-on-one communication with customers or potential
customers. This type of interaction is necessary in selling large-ticket items, such as homes,

Chapter 13

and it’s also effective in situations in which personal attention helps to close a sale, such as
sales of cars and insurance policies.
Many retail stores depend on the expertise

Figure 13.9: Personal selling at Best Buy

and enthusiasm of their salespeople to persuade
customers to buy. Home Depot has grown into a
home-goods giant in large part because it fosters
one-on-one interactions between salespeople and
customers. The real difference between Home
Depot and everyone else isn’t the merchandise; it’s
the friendly, easy-to-understand advice that sales
people give to novice homeowners, according to
one of its cofounders.326 Best Buy’s knowledgeable
sales associates make them “uniquely positioned to
help consumers navigate the increasing complexity
of today's technological landscape” according to
CEO Hubert Joly.327
Figure 13.10: Sales promotion at
Wal-Mart

Sales Promotion
It’s likely that at some point, you have purchased an
item with a coupon or because it was advertised as a buyone-get-one special. If so, you have responded to a sales
promotion – one of the many ways that sellers provide
incentives for customers to buy. Sales promotion activities
include not only those mentioned above but also other forms
of discounting, sampling, trade shows, in-store displays, and
even sweepstakes. Some promotional activities are targeted
directly to consumers and are designed to motivate them to
purchase now. You’ve probably heard advertisers make
statements like “limited time only” or “while supplies last”. If
so, you’ve encountered a sales promotion directed at
consumers. Other forms of sales promotion are directed at
dealers and intermediaries.

Trade shows are one example of a dealer-focused promotion. Mammoth centers such as
McCormick Place in Chicago host enormous events in which manufacturers can display their
new products to retailers and other interested parties. At food shows, for example, potential
buyers can sample products that manufacturers hope to launch to the market. Feedback from
prospective buyers can even result in changes to new product formulations or decisions not to
launch.

Publicity and Public Relations
Free publicity—say, getting your
company or your product mentioned or

pictured in a newspaper or on TV—can
often generate more customer interest
than a costly ad. When Dr. Dre and Jimmy
Iovine were finalizing the development of
their Beats headphones, they sent a pair
to LeBron James. He liked them so much
he asked for 15 more pairs, and they
“turned up on the ears of every member of
the 2008 U.S. Olympic basketball team
when they arrived in Shanghai. ‘Now that's
marketing,’ says Iovine.”328 It wasn’t long before the pricey headphones became a must-have
fashion accessory for everyone from celebrities to high school students.
Consumer perception of a company is often important to a company’s success. Many
companies, therefore, manage their public relations in an effort to garner favorable publicity for
themselves and their products. When the company does something noteworthy, such as
sponsoring a fund-raising event, the public relations department may issue a press release to
promote the event. When the company does something negative, such as selling a
prescription drug that has unexpected side effects, the public relations department will work to
control the damage to the company. Each year the Hay Group and Korn Ferry survey more
than a thousand company top executives, directors, and industry leaders in twenty countries to
identify companies that have exhibited exceptional integrity or commitment to corporate social
responsibility. The rankings are publishes annually as Fortune magazine’s “World’s Most

Marketing Robosapien
Now let’s look more closely at the strategy that Wow Wee pursued in marketing
Robosapien in the United States. The company’s goal was ambitious: to promote the robot as
a must-have item for kids of all ages. As we know, Wow Wee intended to position Robosapien
as a home-entertainment product, not as a toy. The company rolled out the product at Best
Buy, which sells consumer electronics, computers, entertainment software, and appliances. As
marketers had hoped, the robot caught the attention of consumers shopping for TV sets, DVD
players, home and car audio equipment, music, movies, and games. Its $99 price tag was a
little lower than the prices of other merchandise, and that fact was an important asset:
shoppers were willing to treat Robosapien as an impulse item—something extra to pick up as
a gift or as a special present for children, as long as the price wasn’t too high.
Meanwhile, Robosapien was also getting lots of free publicity. Stories appeared in
newspapers and magazines around the world, including the New York Times, the Times of
London, Time magazine, and National Parenting
magazine. Commentators on The Today Show,

Figure: 13.12: Robosapien

The Early Show, CNN, ABC News, and FOX
News all covered it. The product received
numerous awards, and experts predicted that it
would be a hot item for the holidays.
At Wow Wee, Marketing Director Amy
Weltman (who had already had a big hit with the
Rubik’s Cube) developed a gala New York event
to showcase the product. From mid- to late
August, actors dressed in six-foot robot
costumes roamed the streets of Manhattan,
while the fourteen-inch version of Robosapien performed in venues ranging from Grand
Central Station to city bars. Everything was recorded, and film clips were sent to TV stations.

The stage was set for expansion into other stores. Macy’s ran special promotions,
floating a twenty-four-foot cold-air robot balloon from its rooftop and lining its windows with
armies of Robosapien’s. Wow Wee trained salespeople to operate the product so that they
could help customers during in-store demonstrations. Other retailers, including The Sharper
Image, Spencer’s, and Toys “R” Us, carried Robosapien, as did e-retailers such as
Amazon.com. The product was also rolled out (with the same marketing flair) in Europe and
Asia.
When national advertising hit in September, all the pieces of the marketing campaign
came together—publicity, sales promotion, personal selling, and advertising. Wow Wee
ramped up production to meet anticipated fourth-quarter demand and waited to see whether
Robosapien would live up to commercial expectations.

Interacting with Customers
Customer-Relationship Management
Customers are the most important asset that any business has. Without enough good
customers, no company can survive. Firms must not only attract new customers but also retain
current customers. In fact, repeat customers are more profitable. It’s estimated that it costs as
much as five times more to attract and sell to a new customer than to an existing one. 331
Repeat customers also tend to spend more, and they’re much more likely to recommend you
to other people.
Retaining customers is the purpose of customer-relationship management—a
marketing strategy that focuses on using information about current customers to nurture and
maintain strong relationships with them. The underlying theory is fairly basic: to keep
customers happy, you treat them well, give them what they want, listen to them, reward them
with discounts and other loyalty incentives, and deal effectively with their complaints.
Take Caesars Entertainment Corporation, which operates more than fifty casinos under
several brands, including Caesars, Harrah’s, Bally’s, and Horseshoe. Each year, it sponsors

the World Series of Poker with a top prize in the millions. Caesars gains some brand
recognition when the twenty-two-hour event is televised on ESPN, but the real benefit derives
from the information cards filled out by the seven thousand entrants who put up $10,000 each.
Data from these cards is fed into Caesars database, and almost immediately every entrant
starts getting special attention, including party invitations, free entertainment tickets, and room
discounts. The program is all part of Harrah’s strategy for targeting serious gamers and
recognizing them as its best customers.332
Sheraton Hotels uses a softer approach to entice return customers. Sensing that its
resorts needed both a new look and a new strategy for attracting repeat customers, Sheraton
launched its “Year of the Bed” campaign; in addition to replacing all its old beds with luxurious
new mattresses and coverings, it issued a “service promise guarantee”—a policy that any
guest who’s dissatisfied with his or her Sheraton stay will be compensated. The program also
calls for a customer-satisfaction survey and discount offers, both designed to keep the hotel
chain in touch with its customers.333
Another advantage of keeping in touch with customers is the opportunity to offer them
additional products. Amazon.com is a master at this strategy. When you make your first
purchase at Amazon.com, you’re also making a lifelong “friend”—one who will suggest (based
on what you’ve bought before) other things that you might like to buy. Because Amazon.com
continually updates its data on your preferences, the company gets better at making
suggestions.

Social Media Marketing
In the last several years, the popularity of social media marketing has exploded. You
already know what social media is — Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and any number
of other online sites that allow you to network, share your opinions, ideas, photos, etc. Social
media marketing is the practice of including social media as part of a company’s marketing
program.
Why do businesses use social media marketing? Before responding, ask yourself these
questions: how much time do I spend watching TV? When I watch TV, do I sit through the
ads? Do I read newspapers or magazines and flip right past the ads? Now, put yourself in the

place of Annie Young-Scrivner, global chief marketing officer of Starbucks. Does it make sense
for her to spend millions of dollars to place an ad for Starbucks on TV or in a newspaper or
magazine? Or should she instead spend the money on social media marketing initiatives that
have a high probability of connecting to Starbucks’s market?
For companies like Starbucks, the answer is clear. The days of trying to reach
customers through ads on TV, in newspapers, or in magazines are over. Most television
watchers skip over commercials, and few Starbucks’s customers read newspapers or
magazines, and even if they do, they don’t focus on the ads. Social media marketing provides
a number of advantages to companies, including enabling them to:334

 create brand awareness;
 connect with customers and potential

Challenge in action

customers by engaging them in two-way
communication;

 build brand loyalty by providing opportunities
for a targeted audience to participate in
company-sponsored activities, such as
contests;

 offer and publicize incentives, such as special
discounts or coupons;

 gather feedback and ideas on how to improve
products and marketing initiatives;

 allow customers to interact with each other
and spread the word about a company’s
products or marketing initiatives; and

 take advantage of low-cost marketing opportunities by being active on free social
sites, such as Facebook.
To get an idea of the power of social media marketing, think of the ALS Ice Bucket
Challenge. According to the ALS Association: “the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge started in the
summer of 2014 and became the world’s largest global social media phenomenon. More than
17 million people uploaded their challenge videos to Facebook; these videos were watched by

Chapter 13

440 million people a total of 10 billion times.”335 The ALS Association raised $115 million in six
weeks (their usual annual budget was only $20 million).336 To see how companies try to
harness this power, let’s look at social media campaigns of two leaders in this field: PepsiCo
(Mountain Dew) and Starbucks.

Mountain Dew (PepsiCo)
When PepsiCo announced it wouldn’t show a television
commercial during the 2010 Super Bowl game, it came as a

surprise (probably a pleasant one to its competitor, CocaCola, who had already signed on to show several Super Bowl
commercials). What PepsiCo planned to do instead was
invest $20 million into social media marketing campaigns.
One of PepsiCo’s most successful social media initiatives has
been the DEWmocracy campaign, which two years earlier,
resulted in the launch of product—Voltage—created by
Mountain Dew fans.337 Now called DEWcision, the 2016
campaign asks fans to vote between two rival flavors of
Mountain Dew. The campaign engages a number of social media outlets with challenges for
fans to earn votes for their favorite flavor, including Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. 338 The
example in Figure 13.14 is for a challenge to dye your hair the color of your favorite flavor, then
Tweet the picture with the hashtag #DewDye. According to Mountain Dew’s director of
marketing, “PepsiCo looks at social media as the best way to get direct dialog with their fans
and for the company to hear from those fans without filters. ‘It’s been great for us to have this
really unique dialogue that we normally wouldn’t have,’ he said. ‘It really has opened our eyes
up.’”339

Starbucks
One of most enthusiastic users of social media marketing is Starbucks. Let’s look at a
few of their promotions: a discount for “Foursquare” mayors and free coffee on Tax Day via
Twitter’s promoted tweets and a free pastry day promoted through Twitter and Facebook. 340

Starbucks. Foursquare is a mobile social network, and in
addition to the handy “friend finder” feature, you can use it
to find new and interesting places around your
neighborhood to do whatever you and your friends like to
do. It even rewards you for doing business with sponsor
companies, such as Starbucks. The individual with the
most “check in’s” at a particular Starbucks holds the title of
mayor. For a period of time, the mayor of each store got $1
off a Frappuccino. Those who used Foursquare were
particularly excited about Starbucks’s nationwide mayor
rewards program because it brought attention to the
marketing possibilities of the location-sharing app.341
Free Coffee on Tax Day (via Twitter’s Promoted Tweets)
Starbucks was not the only company to give away freebies on Tax Day, April 15, 2010.
Lots of others did.342 But it was the only company to spread the message of their giveaway on
the then-new Twitter’s Promoted Tweets platform (which went into operation on April 13,
2010). Promoted Tweets are Twitter’s means of making money by selling sponsored links to
companies.343 Keeping with Twitter’s 140 characters per tweet rule, Starbucks’s Promoted
Tweet read, “On 4/15 bring a reusable tumbler and we'll fill it with brewed coffee for free. Let's
all switch from paper cups.” The tweet also linked to a page that detailed Starbucks’s
environmental initiatives.344
Free Pastry Day (Promoted through Twitter and Facebook)
Starbucks’s “free pastry day” was promoted on Facebook and Twitter.345 As the word
spread from person to person in digital form, the wave of social media activity drove more than
a million people to Starbucks’s stores around the country in search of free food.346
As word of the freebie offering spread, Starbucks became the star of Twitter, with about
1 percent of total tweets commenting on the brand. That’s almost ten times the number of

mentions on an average day. It performed equally well on Facebook’s event page where
almost 600,000 people joined their friends and signed up as “attendees.”347 This is not
surprising given that Starbucks is the most popular brand on Facebook and has over 36 million
“likes” in 2016.348
How did Starbucks achieve this notoriety on Facebook? According to social media
marketing experts, Starbucks earned this notoriety by making social media a central part of its
marketing mix, distributing special offers, discounts, and coupons to Facebook users and
placing ads on Facebook to drive traffic to its page. As explained by the CEO of Buddy Media,
which oversees the brand’s social media efforts, “Starbucks has provided Facebook users a
reason to become a fan.”349

Social Media Marketing Challenges
The main challenge of social media marketing is that it can be very time consuming. It
takes determination and resources to succeed. Small companies often lack the staff to initiate
and manage social media marketing campaigns.350 Even large companies can find the
management of media marketing initiates overwhelming. A recent study of 1,700 chief
marketing officers indicates that many are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of customer data
available on social sites, such as Facebook and Twitter.351 This is not surprising given that in
2016, Facebook had more than 1.6 billion active users,352 and five hundred million tweets are
sent each day.353 The marketing officers recognize the potential value of this data but are not
always capable of using it. A chief marketing officer in the survey described the situation as
follows: “The perfect solution is to serve each consumer individually. The problem? There are
7 billion of them.”354 In spite of these limitations, 82 percent of those surveyed plan to increase
their use of social media marketing over the next 3 to 5 years. To understand what real-time
information is telling them, companies will use analytics software, which is capable of
analyzing unstructured data. This software is being developed by technology companies, such
as IBM, and advertising agencies.
The bottom line: what is clear is that marketing, and particularly advertising, has
changed forever. As Simon Pestridge, Nike’s global director of marketing for Greater China,
said about Nike’s marketing strategy, “We don’t do advertising any more. Advertising is all

about achieving awareness, and we no longer need awareness. We need to become part of
people’s lives, and digital allows us to do that.”355

A New Marketing Model
The 4 P’s have served marketers well for generations, but new innovations can disrupt
even the most tried-and-true ways of doing business. A new framework is taking hold in
marketing – the SAVE method. SAVE is an acronym that stands for Solution, Access, Value
and Education. The framework was developed by Richard Ettenson, Eduardo Conrado, and
Jonathan Knowles, and was first published in Harvard Business Review in 2013.356 The
authors advocate replacing the 4P’s with SAVE as companies define their offerings. The
essence of the SAVE framework is as follows:
1)

Solution replaces Product: Products solve a need for a customer; the SAVE
framework seeks to move the orientation of businesses away from a product
focus to more of a customer-based perspective. Customers, after all, will only
care about your product if it solves a problem for them or at least contributes
meaningfully to doing so.

2)

Access instead of Place: Both “access” and “place” speak to the same point –
how can my customers obtain my product or service? But in an age where so
many products and services are obtained online, the word “access” incorporates
more than just a physical location.

3)

Value takes the place of Price: Marketers have sought to value-price for years. It
is only when they see the value in a product or service that they become willing
to pay the price to obtain it. The SAVE model seeks to orient companies to their
full value proposition as opposed to focusing on how much they will charge.

4)

Education replaces Promotion: In its most basic form, promotion is about
informing potential customers so that they will recognize the value in a product or
service and part with the funds necessary to obtain it. The SAVE model logically
employs the word “education” in its acronym. However, as we have seen,
promotion is more than information; it may also involve incentives such as

Chapter 13

discounts and other forms of sales promotion. In this respect, the 4 P’s seems
more complete than the SAVE model.
The SAVE framework appears to be gaining traction, and it may eventually replace the
4 P’s altogether. If so, we will no doubt find ourselves rewriting this chapter!

Pricing a Product
As introduced in a previous chapter, one of the four Ps in the marketing mix is price.
Pricing is such an important aspect of marketing that it merits its own chapter. Pricing a
product involves a certain amount of trial and error because there are so many factors to
consider. If a product or service is priced too high, many people simply won’t buy it. Or your
company might even find itself facing competition from some other supplier that thinks it can
beat your price. On the other hand, if you price too low, you might not make enough profit to
stay in business. Let’s look at several pricing options that were available to those marketers at
Wow Wee who were responsible for pricing Robosapien, an example we introduced earlier.
We’ll begin by discussing two strategies that are particularly applicable to products that are
being newly introduced.

New Product Pricing Strategies
When Robosapien was introduced to the

Figure 54.1 Sony’s robot dog, Aibo.

market, it had little direct competition in its product
category. True, there were some “toy” robots
available, but they were not nearly as sophisticated.
Sony offered a pet dog robot called Aibo, but its price
tag of $1,800 was really high. Even higher up the
price-point scale was the $3,600 iRobi robot made by
the Korean company Yujin Robotics to entertain kids
and even teach them foreign languages. Parents
could also monitor kids’ interactions with the robot
through its video-camera eyes; in fact, they could even
use the robot to relay video messages telling kids to
shut it off and go to sleep.357

Skimming and Penetration Pricing
Because Wow Wee was introducing an innovative product in an emerging market with
few direct competitors, it considered one of two pricing strategies:

Chapter 14

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

315

1) With a skimming strategy, Wow Wee would start off with the highest price that
keenly interested customers would pay. This approach would generate early profits,
but when competition enters—and it will, because at high prices, healthy profits can
be made in the market—Wow Wee would have to lower its price. Even without
competition, they would likely lower prices gradually to bring in another group of
consumers not willing to pay the initial high price.
2) Using penetration pricing, Wow Wee would initially charge a low price, both to
discourage competition and to grab a sizable share of the market. This strategy
might give the company some competitive breathing room (potential competitors
won’t be attracted to low prices and modest profits). Over time, as its dominating
market share discourages competition, Wow Wee could push up its prices.

Other Pricing Strategies
In their search for the best price level, Wow Wee’s marketing managers could consider
a variety of other approaches, such as cost-based pricing, demand-based pricing, prestige
pricing, and odd-even pricing. Any of these methods could be used not only to set an initial
price but also to establish long-term pricing levels.
Before we examine these strategies, let’s pause for a moment to think about the pricing
decisions that you have to make if you’re selling goods for resale by retailers. Most of us think
of price as the amount that we—consumers—pay for a product. But when a manufacturer
(such as Wow Wee) sells goods to retailers, the price it gets is not what we the consumers will
pay for the product. In fact, it’s a lot less.
Here’s an example. Say you buy a shirt at the mall for $40 and that the shirt was sold to
the retailer by the manufacturer for $20. In this case, the retailer would have applied a
mark-up of 100 percent to this shirt, or in other words $20 mark-up is added to the $20 cost to
arrive at its price (hence a 100% markup) resulting in a $40 sales price to the consumer. Markup allows the retailer to cover its costs and make a profit.

Cost-Based Pricing
Using cost-based pricing, Wow Wee’s accountants would figure out how much it costs
to make Robosapien and then set a price by adding a profit to the cost. If, for example, it cost

316

http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961

Chapter 14

$40 to make the robot, Wow Wee could add on $10 for profit and charge retailers $50. Costbased pricing has a fundamental flaw – it ignores the value that consumers would place on the
product. As a result, it is typically only employed in cases where something new or customized
is being developed where the cost and value cannot easily be determined before the product is
developed. A defense contractor might use cost-based pricing for a new missile system, for
example. The military might agree to pay costs plus some agreed amount of profit to create the
needed incentives for the contractor to develop the system. Building contractors might also use
cost-based pricing to protect themselves from unforeseen changes in a project: the client
wanting a home addition would get an estimate of the cost and have an agreement for
administrative fees or profit, but if the client changes what they want, or the contractor has
unexpected complications in the project, the client will pay for the additional costs.

Demand-Based Pricing
Let’s say that Wow Wee learns through market research how much people are willing to
pay for Robosapien. Following a demand-based pricing approach, it would use this
information to set the price that it charges retailers. If consumers are willing to pay $120 retail,
Wow Wee would charge retailers a price that would allow retailers to sell the product for $120.
What would that price be? If the 100% mark-up example applied in this case, here’s how we
would arrive at it: $120 consumer selling price minus a $60 markup by retailers means that
Wow Wee could charge retailers $60. Retailer markup varies by product category and by
retailer, so this example is just to illustrate the concept.

Dynamic Pricing
In the hospitality industry, the supply of available rooms or seats is fixed; it cannot be
changed easily. Moreover, once the night is over or the flight has departed, you can no longer
sell that room or seat. This fact combined with the variation in demand for rooms or flights on
certain days or times (think holidays or special events), has led to dynamic pricing. Revenue
management, and the growth of online travel agencies (OTA’s) like Hotwire, Expedia, and
Priceline are methods of maximizing revenue for a given night or flight. Hotels and airlines
use sophisticated revenue management tools to forecast demand and adjust the availability
of various price points. Online travel agents like Hotwire publicize last-minute availability with
special rates so that unsold rooms or flights can attract customers and still earn revenue. This

317

approach allows hotels and airlines to maximize revenue opportunities for high demand times
such as university graduations and holidays, and also for special events like the Super Bowl or
the Olympics. Losses are minimized during low-demand times because unused capacity is
offered at a discount, attracting customers who might not have considered travelling at off peak
times.

Prestige Pricing
Some people associate a high price with high quality—and, in fact, there generally is a
correlation. Thus, some companies adopt a prestige-pricing approach—setting prices
artificially high to foster the impression that they’re offering a high-quality product.
Competitors are reluctant to lower their prices because it would suggest that they’re
lower-quality products. Let’s say that Wow Wee finds some amazing production method that
allows it to produce Robosapien at a fraction of its current cost. It could pass the savings on by
cutting the price, but it might be reluctant to do so: what if consumers equate low cost with
poor quality?
Figure 14.2: Odd-even pricing—it’s less
than $60.00!

Odd-Even Pricing
Do you think $9.99 sounds cheaper than
$10? If you do, you’re part of the reason that
companies sometimes use odd-even pricing—
pricing products a few cents (or dollars) under an
even number. Retailers, for example, might price
Robosapien at $99 (or even $99.99) if they thought
consumers would perceive it as less than $100.

Loss Leaders
Have you ever seen items in stores that were priced so low that you wondered how the
store could make any money? There’s a good chance they weren’t – the store may have been
using a loss leader strategy – pricing an item at a loss to draw customers into the store. Once
there, store managers hope that the customer will either buy accessories to go along with the
new purchase or actually select a different item not priced at a loss. You might have visited the
store to buy a specially-priced laptop and ended up leaving with a more expensive one that

Chapter 14

had a faster processor. Or perhaps you bought the HDTV that was advertised, but then also
bought a new surge protector and a streaming player. In either case, you did exactly what the
store hoped when they priced the advertised item at a loss.

Bundling
Perhaps you are one of the many customers of a cable television provider that also
buys their high-speed internet and/or their phone service. Or when you stop by your favorite
fast-food outlet for lunch, maybe you sometimes buy the combo of burger, fries, and a drink. If
you do, you’ve experienced the common practice of a bundling strategy – pricing items as a
group, or bundle, at a discount to the cost of buying the items separately. Bundling has
significant advantages to both buyers and sellers. Obviously, buyers receive the discount.
Sellers, on the other hand, can sell more goods and services with this approach. Perhaps you
would have settled for a water instead of a soft drink, but the combo price made the soft drink
just a few cents more. Without bundling, that soft drink might not have been sold.
If the sale involves some kind of recurring service – like the previously-mentioned
example of cable – bundling can also result in higher levels of customer retention. If you
decided one day that you wanted to replace your cable with satellite TV, for example, you
might well find that the discount from moving to satellite was far less than you expected,
because unbundled from cable TV, the price for your internet service could take a substantial
jump. If so, like many others who have likely considered making this move, you might find it in
your best interests to stick with the original bundled package, no matter how trapped or
frustrated you might feel as a result.

The Product Life Cycle

Figure 14.3: A Toyota RAV-4, a top-selling small sized SUV.
Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) are among the most popular categories of passenger car
on U.S. roads. Offering an elevated view of the road, the safety that comes with size, spacious
interior and cargo areas, and often superior handling performance in bad weather – especially
4-wheel-drive SUVs – it is no wonder that American consumers have bought tens of millions of
these vehicles. For a long time, SUV sales followed close to the classical pattern of what is
known as the product life cycle:
Figure 14.4: The Product Life Cycle

320

Chapter 14

Yet in 2009, when the economy faltered due to the financial crisis and oil prices surged
from about $40 a barrel to nearly $80,358 many pundits declared the SUV to be in permanent
decline. In fact, the data appeared to support this contention:
Figure 14.5: SUV sales by category, 1990-2012

As you can see from the figure, SUV sales did in fact decline, rather dramatically. But
SUV sales are too critical to the profitability of the major automakers for them to just watch
their cash flows disappear.359 Instead, the automakers redesigned their products, including an
increased emphasis on smaller SUVs. In fact, the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4, two of
the smaller SUV’s on the market, now battle each other for the crown of top-selling SUV in the
U.S.360 Many consumers adapted their budgets to compensate for higher oil prices. Sales,
particularly of mid-sized SUVs, roared back in 2010, with sales of large SUV’s showing a
similar, but smaller, upward trend too.
While their new designs certainly helped to reinvigorate sales, more recently
automakers have gotten a somewhat unexpected additional boost from declining oil prices. For
all their benefits, SUVs are not the most fuel efficient cars on the market. But as consumers
began to pay less at the pump, the cost of operating SUVs declined, and SUV sales have
continued to be strong. Automakers continue to invest in new models – for example, German
automaker Volkswagen introduced a new 5-seat mid-sized SUV at the Detroit auto show in
January, 2015. The company is assembling a group of about 200 experts, including

representatives of its dealer network, to help it better cater its offerings to the American
market.361
Many products tend to follow the classical product life cycle pattern of Figure 14.4. Let’s
take a closer look at the product life cycle and see what we can learn from it. The graph is a
simplified depiction of the product life cycle concept. Many products never make it past the
introduction stage. Some products avoid or reverse decline by reinventing themselves. In part,
reinvention is what the SUV market has experienced, in addition to the boost it has received
from lower gas prices.

The Life Cycle and the Changing Marketing Mix
As a product or brand moves through its life cycle, the company that markets it will shift
its marketing-mix strategies. Figure 14.6 summarizes the market and industry features of each
stage. Let’s see how the mix might be changed to address the differences from one stage to

Introduction Stage
At the start of the introduction stage, people – other
than those who work in the industry – are likely to be

Figure 14.7: Google Glass

completely unaware that a product even exists. Building
awareness is a key to adoption of the product. Companies
invest in advertising to make consumers aware of their
offerings and the benefits of becoming a customer. For many
products, the early adopters are people who value newness
and innovation. If a company faces only limited competition, it
might use a skimming approach to pricing because people
who want to be among the first to have the product will
generally be willing to pay a higher price (recall that
“skimming” means that the company will set initial prices high,
and only those consumers who feel especially excited about
the product will buy it). The company will then lower prices to appeal to the next layer of
consumers – those who wanted the product but were unwilling to pay the high introductory
price. The company will continue to gradually lower prices, in effect taking off layer after layer
of potential customers until the product is priced low enough to be afforded by the mass
market.
If the company has or expects a lot of competition, though, it may decide to use
penetration pricing and capture a lot of market share, which may discourage some potential
competitors from entering the market at all. The higher the price levels in a market, the more
likely it is that new competitors will want to enter.
During the introductory stage, the industry as whole will sell only a relatively small
quantity of the product, so competitors will distribute the product through just a few channels.
Most retailers charge what is called a “slotting fee” – a payment the manufacturer makes to
persuade the retailer to stock the item. If the product fails, they do not offer refunds on these
charges, so producers will want to be confident that a product will draw enough customers
before they pay these fees and so may limit its initial distribution. Because sales at this stage
are low while advertising and other costs are high, all competitors tend to lose money during
this stage.

reach the growth stage relatively quickly – or it
could take many months or even longer for that
point to arrive, if it happens at all. In order for
industry sales to increase rapidly, advertising
costs will generally be very high during the growth
stage. If competition appears, companies may
respond by lowering prices to retain their market
shares. Competitors will also be looking for
channels in which to distribute their products. Where possible, they will try to establish
exclusive arrangements with distributors, at least for a period of time, so that their product may
be the only one available in a product category at a particular retail outlet. During the growth
stage, it is also important for companies to invest in making improvements to their products so
as to maintain any advantage they may have established over their competitors. Since sales
are rising rapidly during the growth stage, many products begin to turn a profit here, even
though they are still investing heavily in advertising, establishing distribution, and refining the
product itself.

Maturity Stage

Figure 14.9: Smartphones

If a product survives the growth stage,
it will probably remain in the maturity stage
for a long time. Sales still grow in the initial
part of this stage, though at a decreasing
rate. Later in the maturity stage, sales will
plateau and eventually begin to move in a
slightly downward direction. By this stage, if
not sooner, competitors will have settled on a
strategy intended to deliver them a

sustainable competitive advantage – either by being the low cost producer of a product, or by
successfully differentiating their product from the competition. Since at least one competitor will
generally move towards a low-cost strategy, after initially peaking, price levels begin to decline
during the maturity stage. Price wars may even occur, but profits still tend to be strong
because sales volume remains high.
As the product becomes outdated, the company may make changes in keeping with
changing consumer preferences, but usually not as rapidly as in the earlier stages of the life of
a product. Branding becomes a key aspect of success in the maturity stage, particularly for
those companies seeking to differentiate their products as their source of competitive
advantage. Also during the maturity stage, industry consolidation is high; in other words, larger
competitors will buy up smaller competitors in order to find synergies and build share and scale
economies. Some models of the product life cycle reflect a stage called “shakeout”, which
occurs towards the end of the growth and the beginning of the maturity stages. The term
shakeout reflects this trend towards industry consolidation. Some competitors survive and
others get “shaken out,” either by going out of business or by being acquired by a stronger
competitor.

Decline Stage

Figure 14.10: a landline phone

At some point, virtually every product will reach the
decline stage, the point at which sales drop significantly.
New innovations, changes in consumer tastes, regulations,
and other forces from the macro-level business
environment can change the outlook for a product almost
overnight. Products with a very short life cycle are known
as “fads”. They may move through the entire product life
cycle in a matter of months. Many products, particularly
those which have experienced a long period in maturity,
may stay in the decline phase for years. Ironically, price levels during the decline stage may
actually increase, which occurs because the number of competitors is few – in fact, there may
be only one remaining, giving that company great pricing power over the few consumers who
still want or need the product. New product development is usually very limited, unless a
company believes that innovation can restart growth in the category, as we saw with new SUV

models. Also, advertising is typically limited or non-existent – those who need the product are
likely to know about it already. So while it may seem counter-intuitive, many companies make
a lot of money while they are riding the downward shape of the product life cycle curve during
the decline stage.

Key Take-Aways
1) There are several pricing strategies appropriate for different
product and market situations:
a. A new product can be introduced with a skimming
strategy—starting off with a high price that keenly
interested customers are willing to pay. The alternative is a
penetration strategy, charging a low price, both to keep
out competition and to grab as much market share as
possible
b. With cost-based pricing, a company determines the cost
of making a product and then sets a price by adding a profit
to the cost.
c. With demand-based pricing, marketers set the price that
they think consumers will pay.
d. Companies use prestige pricing to capitalize on the
common association of high price and quality, setting an
artificially high price to substantiate the impression of high
quality.
e. Finally, with odd-even pricing, companies set prices at
such figures as $9.99 (an odd amount), counting on the
common impression that it sounds cheaper than $10 (an
even amount).

Tourism

Figure 15.1: Postcards in Italy
The tourism industry is often cited as the largest industry in the world, contributing 10%
of the world’s GDP. In 2014 there were over 1.1 billion international tourists: that’s a
substantial economic impact and movement of goods and services! 362 Tourism is also
considered an export and is unique in that the consumers come to the product where it is
consumed on-site. Before we dig any deeper, let’s explore what the term “tourism” means.

Definition of Tourism
There are a number of ways tourism can be defined. Recently, the United Nations
World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) embarked on a project from 2005 to 2007 to create a
common glossary of terms for tourism. It defines tourism as follows:
A social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement
of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or
business/professional purposes. These people are called visitors (which may be
either tourists or excursionists; residents or non-residents) and tourism has to do
with their activities, some of which imply tourism expenditure.363

In other words, tourism is the movement of people for a number of purposes (whether
business or pleasure). It is important to understand the various groups and constituencies
involved in this movement. Of course it includes the tourist, but also the vast array of
businesses providing goods and services for the tourist, the government and political structure
of a destination, and the local residents of the destination community itself. Each of these
components are necessary parts of a successful tourism destination and operate within private
and public sectors, the built environment, and the natural environment. All these come together
to create the processes, activities, and outcomes of tourism.
If it all seems a little overwhelming, it might be helpful to break tourism down into broad
industry groups, each of which will be covered in this chapter:

 Accommodation and Lodging
 Food and beverage services (F & B)
 Recreation and Entertainment
 Convention & Event Management
 Travel Services
 Country Clubs
Benefits and Costs of Tourism
Tourism impacts can be grouped into three main categories: economic, social, and
environmental. These impacts are analyzed using data gathered by businesses, governments,
and industry organizations. Some impacts gain more attention than others. It is also important
to recognize that different groups and constituencies are impacted differently.

Economic Impacts of Tourism
The tourism industry has a huge economic impact that continues to expand to new
markets and destinations. According to the UNWTO, in 2015 “The total export value from
international tourism amounted to US$ 1.4 trillion.”364 Regions with the highest growth in terms

of tourism dollars earned are the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Pacific, and Africa. Only the
Middle East posted negative growth at the time of the report. As well, the UNWTO’s Tourism
2020 Vision report predicts that international arrivals will reach nearly 1.6 billion by 2020.365
Figure 15.2 provides additional information about the impact of tourism worldwide.
Positive impacts from this economic boom include robust foreign exchange, increases
in income, and GDP growth. Tourism can also offer diverse employment opportunities, can be
developed with local products, and is often compatible with other economic activities within a
destination. Tourism often injects money into the community that leads to secondary economic
development as well. For example, successful resorts may create the need for a commercial
laundry facility or a pet boarding business.
However, there are also negative impacts. Property values may increase to the point of
unaffordability for local residents, and the seasonality of the tourism industry may create a
feast-or-famine economy. As with any economy, if too many resources are focused on just one
industry, communities may be vulnerable to any unexpected economic, social, or
environmental changes. One example is the New Jersey shore after the devastation of

Hurricane Sandy. The tourism industry was destroyed, leaving no economic fallback for local
residents.

Social Impacts of Tourism
In addition to the economic benefits of tourism development, positive social impacts
include an increase in amenities (e.g., parks, recreation facilities), investment in arts, culture,
heritage and tradition, celebration of indigenous communities, and community pride. Tourism
also has the potential to break down language, socio-cultural, religious, and political barriers.
When developed conscientiously, tourism can, and does, contribute to a positive quality of life
for residents and promotes a positive image of the destination.
However, as identified by the United Nations Environment Programme, negative social
impacts of tourism can include: change or loss of indigenous identity and values; culture
clashes; changes in family structure; conflict within the community for the tourism dollar; and
ethical issues, including an increase in sex tourism, crime, gambling, and/or the exploitation of
child workers.366

Environmental Impacts of Tourism
Tourism relies on, and greatly impacts, the natural environment in which it operates. In
some destinations, there is a great appreciation of the environmental resources as the source
of the tourism industry, and as such there are environmental protection policies and plans in
place. Tourism has helped to save many delicate ecosystems and their flora and fauna.
Preservation of these important resources benefits not only the tourist but also the local
residents as well.
Even though many areas of the world are conserved in the form of parks and protected
areas, tourism development can still have severe negative economic impacts. According to
The United Nations Environment Programme, these can include the depletion of natural
resources (water, forests, etc.), pollution (air pollution, noise, sewage, waste and littering), and
physical impacts (construction activities, marina development, trampling, loss of biodiversity,
and spread of disease).367

The environmental impacts of tourism can reach beyond local areas and have an effect
on the global ecosystem. One example is increased air travel, which is often identified as a
major contributor to climate change.
Whether positive or negative, tourism is a force for change around the world, and the
industry is transforming at a staggering rate.

Accommodation and Lodging
The Hospitality Industry
When looking at tourism it’s important to
consider the term hospitality. Some define
hospitality as “the business of helping people

Figure 15.3: Shirley Plantation, with a
pineapple on the roof.

to feel welcome and relaxed and to enjoy
themselves.”368 Simply put, the hospitality
industry is the combination of the
accommodation and food and
beverage groupings, collectively making up the
largest segment of the industry.
The pineapple has long been the symbol
of hospitality. The Caribs, indigenous people of
the Lower Antilles in the Caribbean, first used it
as such a symbol. The Spaniards knew they
were welcome if a pineapple was placed at the
entrance to the village. This symbolism spread across Europe and North America where it
became the custom to carve the shape of a pineapple into the columns at the entrance of the
plantation.369 Charles Carter added a three and a half foot wooden pineapple to the peak of the
roof at Shirley Plantation, the first plantation in Virginia.370 It is now common to see the image
of the pineapple as a sign of welcome, warmth and hospitality.

need staff to check in guests, provide housekeeping, employ maintenance workers, and
provide a place for people to sleep. As such, they can be grouped together under the heading
of accommodation and lodging. Figure 15.4 summarizes the various groupings within the
industry.

Hotel Types
Hotels are typically referred to by hotel type or category. The type of hotel is
determined primarily by the size and location of the building structure, and then by the function,
target market, service level, amenities, and industry standards.

Classifications
Hotels may be classified on a number of different variables. A hotel’s size is based on
the number of guest rooms it has; hotel sizes can range from a small boutique hotel with fewer
than 50 rooms to a large resort hotel with more than 1,000 rooms. The location of a hotel can
also determine the type of guest served. An airport hotel may be very different from a bed and
breakfast or a conference hotel. The level of service provided is also a key variable, ranging
from an inexpensive budget or economy hotel, which may have limited services and amenities,
to upscale and luxury hotels with full services and a wide range of amenities. What are
amenities? They are the extra activities or services available at a hotel beyond the guest room
itself. They can include basics such as accessibility or parking, or higher-end options like spas,
golf courses, and elegant restaurants. The type of ownership is also an important variable:
many branded hotels are franchised, but many are operated as independent hotels. Owners
may manage their own hotels or many hire a third party manager. A hotel chain such as
Marriott or Hilton may in fact be comprised of several different brands: Marriott currently has 19
different hotel brands, with each name representing a different level of price, service, or target
customer segment. There are several industry organizations, such as AAA or TripAdvisor,
which can provide consumers with ratings for individual hotels.
Figure 15.5 on the next page outlines the characteristics of specific hotel types that
have evolved to match the needs of a particular traveler segment. As you can see, hotels
adapt and diversify depending on the markets they want and need to attract to stay in
business.

Management Contracts

Figure 15.6: The Inn at Virginia Tech, managed
It is common for ownership to utilize a by Benchmark Hospitality
management contract, which is a service
offered by a management company to
manage a hotel or resort for its owners.
Owners have two main options for the
structure of a management contract. One is
to enter into a franchise agreement to
secure a brand and then engage an
independent third-party hotel management
company to manage the hotel. A slightly
different option is for owners to select a single company to provide both the brand and the
expertise to manage the property. Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, and Four Seasons Hotels and
Resorts are companies that provide this second option to owners.
Selecting a brand affiliation is one of the most significant decisions hotel owners must
make.371 The brand affiliation selected will largely determine the cost of hotel development or
conversion of an existing property to meet the standards of the new brand. The affiliation will
also determine a number of things about the ongoing operation including the level of services
and amenities offered, cost of operation, marketing opportunities or restrictions, and the
competitive position in the marketplace. For these reasons, owners typically consider several
branding options before choosing to operate independently or to adopt a brand affiliation.

Chains and Franchise Agreements
Another managerial and ownership structure is franchising. A hotel franchise enables
individuals or investment companies (the franchisee) to build or purchase a hotel and then buy
or lease a brand name to become part of a chain of hotels using the franchisor’s hotel brand,
image, loyalty program, goodwill, procedures, controls, marketing, and reservations
systems.372
A franchisee becomes part of a network of properties that use a central reservations
system with access to electronic distribution channels, regional and national marketing

programs, central purchasing, revenue management support, and brand operating standards.
A franchisee also receives training, support, and advice from the franchisor and must adhere
to regular inspections, audits, and reporting requirements.
Selecting a franchise structure may reduce

Figure 15.7: The San Diego Marriott

investment risk by enabling the franchisee to
associate with an established hotel company.
Franchise fees can be substantial, and a franchisee
must be willing to adhere to the contractual
obligations with the franchisor.373 Franchise fees
typically include an initial fee paid with the franchise
application and continuing fees paid during the term
of the agreement. These fees are usually a
percentage of revenue but can be set at a fixed fee.
The total percentage of sales ranges significantly for
hotels from 3.3% - 14.7% with a median of
11.8%.374

Hotel and Lodging Personnel
While the complexity of the organization chart varies significantly from an 80 room
highway hotel to a 1000+ room city center hotel, the responsibilities and compensation

between a General Manager (GM) of a 150 room hotel and the Front Office Manager of a
1000+ city center hotel may be similar. The path to a GM at a small hotel is much quicker than
at a more complex large hotel or resort. Not surprisingly, typical managerial positions are
found in the hotel industry but responsibilities and compensation can vary based on the size
and complexity of the hotel. As you read about them, think about which position(s) hold the
greatest interest to you.

General Manager and Director of Operations
The General Manager’s role is to provide strategic leadership and planning to all
departments so revenue is maximized, employee relations are strong, and guests are satisfied.
The General Manager is responsible for owner and brand relationships and community
involvement. The Director of Operations/Assistant General Manager is responsible for
providing guidance to department heads to achieve their targets and for directing the day-today operations of the hotel operating departments.

Director of Rooms
Director of Rooms/Resident Manager is responsible for the effective operation of
Front Desk, Bell Staff, Valet, Housekeeping, Reservations, Revenue Management, and other
room related departments. The department heads for these areas each report to the Director
of Rooms. The Director provides guidance and leadership to these departments which in turn
seek to maximize revenue, guest satisfaction and financial performance.

Front Office Manager

Figure 15.9: Front desk staff

Reporting to the Director of Rooms, the

rooms, occupancy forecasts, and the day-to-day
functions of the front office. The Front Desk
Managers and Agents report to the Front Office
Manager and work in the lobby or reception area to
welcome the guests to the property, process arrivals
and departures, coordinate room assignments and
pre-arrivals, and respond to guest requests.

Revenue Manager
Revenue Management is the use of pricing, inventory control, booking channels, and
mix of group and transient rooms sold to maximize revenue of the hotel. One challenge in
lodging is perishability: once the night has passed, the chance to sell that room is gone.
Depending on the size and complexity of the hotel, Revenue Management can be handled by
an onsite manager, by a centralized Revenue Management office, or with a 3 rd party company.
The Revenue Manager usually falls under the responsibility of the Rooms Director but in some
cases can report to the Director of Sales and Marketing.

Executive Housekeeper
Reporting to the Director of Rooms, the Executive Housekeeper manages and
oversees housekeeping operations and staff including the Housekeeping Manager,
Supervisor, House Persons, Room Attendants and Laundry Operations. An Executive
Housekeeper is responsible for implementing the operating procedures and standards and the
overall cleanliness or the rooms and hotel. He or she also plans, coordinates, and schedules
the housekeeping staff. Room audits and inspections are completed regularly to ensure
standards are met.375

Reservation Agents
The guest’s experience starts with the first interaction he or she has with a property,
often during the reservation process. Today, even with online reservations available to guests,
there is still a role for the reservations agent, as some guests still prefer the one-to-one
connection with another person. The extent to which the reservations agent position is
resourced will vary depending on the target market and business strategy of the hotel.

Food and Beverage Director
The Food and Beverage Director is responsible for all food and beverage service on
and off premises, including social catering and group food functions, in-room dining, and all
outlets such as restaurants, clubs, lounges and bars. The Executive Chef, the Director of
Banquets, and the managers responsible for each restaurant report to the Director of Food and

marketing of outlets and special events, budget
planning and all other aspects of food and beverage
operations to maximize revenue, profitability and
guest satisfaction. The Food and Beverage
Director reports to the General Manager.

Catering and Banquet Managers
Catering and Banquet Managers oversee
food served by hotels or catering companies at
banquets and special events at a diverse set of
venues. Note that the term Banquets usually pertains to catered food served on premise,
while Catering typically refers to off-premise service. At a catered event, customers typically
eat at the same time, as opposed to restaurant customers who are served individually or in
small groups.
Catering businesses (whether on-site or at special locations) are challenged by the
episodic nature of events, and the issues of food handling and food safety with large groups.
Catering businesses include:

 Catering companies
 Conference centers
 Conference hotels
 Wedding venues
 Festival food coordinators
Sales and Marketing Director
The Sales and Marketing Director is responsible for establishing sales and marketing
activities that maximize the hotel’s revenues. Revenue maximization is typically accomplished
by coordinating marketing and promotional activities to build occupancy and revenue

opportunities for the hotel’s accommodation, conference and catering space, leisure facilities,
and food and beverage outlets. Social media presence is critical in the hospitality industry. In
larger hotels this responsibility is often a dedicated Social Media Manager or is the
responsibility of the Sales & Marketing team.

Director of Finance
The Director of Finance or Controller is responsible for the overall accounting and
finance-related activities including accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, credit,
systems management, cash management, food and beverage cost control, receiving,
purchasing, food stores, capital planning and budgeting. The Director of Finance plays an
integral part in relationships with ownership as well.

Chief Engineer
The Chief Engineer is the lead for the effective operation and maintenance of the
property on a day-to-day basis, typically including general maintenance, utility management,
heating, ventilation, air conditioning, kitchen maintenance, carpentry, electrical, and
plumbing.376 The Chief Engineer is also responsible for preventive maintenance and resource
management programs.

Human Resources Director
The Human Resources Director provides guidance and advice on a wide range of
practices including recruitment and selection, training and development, employee orientation,
employee relations, rewards and recognition, performance management, and health and
safety.

Regional Management and Corporate-Level Positions
Careers progress above the General Manager level regional or multi-unit responsibility.
These would include Regional Manager/Vice-President Regional Sales Director, Human
Resources Director, etc. Corporate positions in training, field support, brand management,
revenue management, franchise support, corporate recruiting, etc. are career options as well.

Non-Traditional Hotel Career Paths
Students tend to think of the hospitality industry in terms of operations management
roles dealing directly with the customer. While those positions do represent a significant
portion of the entry level opportunities, many non-traditional career options exist in the
Hospitality industry as well:

 Property Director of Finance – works on the financial health of a hotel property
 Asset Manager – works for the owner and is responsible for the strategic
direction of the asset

 Hotel Broker – Is responsible for the buying and selling of hotels
 Hotel Consultant - Provide consulting services to hotel owners
 Data Analytics – Working with hotel loyalty program data and the brands to
determine strategic direction of the brands

 Market Researcher – Working with the brands to set strategy for brand evolution
and marketing campaigns

Food and Beverage Services

Figure 15.11: Fine Dining

The food and beverage sector is commonly known to industry professionals by its
initials F&B. The F&B sector grew from simple origins to meet the basic needs for food and
beverage services to increasing demand for unique experiences and broader options. As the
interests of the public became more diverse, so too did the offerings of the F&B sector. The
increasing awareness and demand for organic, sustainable, local or craft options as well as
special dietary needs in food and beverage continue to challenge this industry. In addition, in
order to better attract and serve a diverse array of diners, the F&B industry now consists of a
variety of segments. The following is a discussion of each.

Quick Service Restaurants

Figure 15.12: Quick service
Restaurants

Formerly known as fast-food restaurants, examples
of quick-service restaurants, or QSRs, include Chick-fil-A,
Subway, and Pizza Hut. This prominent portion of the food
sector generally caters to both residents and visitors, and it is
represented in areas that are conveniently accessed by both.
Brands, chains, and franchises dominate the QSR

landscape. While the sector has made steps to move away from the traditional “fast-food”
image and style of service, it is still dominated by both fast food and food fast; in other words,
food that is purchased and prepared quickly, and
Figure 15.13: Red Robin: A fullservice, family-casual restaurant

generally consumed quickly as well.

Fast Casual Restaurants
Fast Casual restaurants focus on higher quality
ingredients than QSR’s and provide made-to-order food
in an environment that does not include table service.
Customers usually queue and order at a counter. The
seating area is more upscale and comfortable.
Examples would include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Panera
and Jason’s Deli.

Full-Service Restaurants
Full-service restaurants are perhaps the most fluid of the F&B operation types,
adjusting and changing to the demands of the marketplace. Consumer expectations are higher
here than with QSRs.377 The menus offered are
varied, but in general reflect the image of the

Figure 15.14: Le Procope, in Paris, a full
service fine dining restaurant

restaurant or consumer’s desired experience.
Major segments include fine dining,
family/casual, ethnic, and upscale casual. Fine
dining restaurants are characterized by highly
trained chefs preparing complex food items,
exquisitely presented. Meals are brought to the
table by experienced servers with sound food
and beverage knowledge in an upscale
atmosphere with table linens, fine china, crystal
stemware, and silver-plate cutlery. The table is
often embellished with fresh flowers and candles. In these businesses, the average check,
which is the total sales divided by number of guests served, is quite high (often reviewed with

the cost symbols of three or four dollar signs: $$$ or $$$$.) Examples include the Inn at Little
Washington, Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse and Capitol Grille.
Casual restaurants serve moderately-priced to upscale food in a more casual
atmosphere. Casual dining comprises a market segment between fast casual establishments
and fine dining restaurants. Casual dining restaurants often have a full bar with separate bar
staff, a larger beer menu and a limited wine menu. This segment is full of chains such as
Chili’s, Outback, Red Robin and Cracker Barrel as well as many independent restaurants in
regional or local markets.
Family restaurants offer affordable menu items that span a variety of customer tastes.
They also have the operational flexibility in menu and restaurant layout to welcome large
groups of diners. An analysis of menus in family/casual restaurants reveals a high degree of
operational techniques such as menu item cross-utilization, where a few key ingredients are
repurposed in several ways. Both chain and independent restaurant operators flourish in this
sector. Examples of chains in this category would be Golden Corral, Cici’s Pizza and
Ponderosa Steakhouse.
Ethnic restaurants typically reflect the owner’s cultural identity, Vietnamese, Cuban,
Thai, etc. The growth and changing nature of this sector reflects the acceptance of various
ethnic foods within our communities. Ethnic restaurants generally evolve along two routes:
toward remaining authentic to the cuisine of the country of origin or toward larger market
acceptance through modifying menu items.378 Examples would be P.F. Chang’s, Tara Thai or
Pei Wei.

Bars, Wineries, and Craft Distilling
The beverage industry continues to

Figure 15.15: The restaurant industry career
path

evolve as well with a strong focus on local craft
beers, wines, cider and distilling. Wineries exist in
almost every state, with over 250 in Virginia as of
2015.379 Wine, bourbon, cider trails and brew pub
crawls, etc. are used to generate awareness and
create experiences for customers. Wineries often
use event space or festivals to take advantage of
the beauty of the winery and supplement their
revenues.

Institutional Food Service
Institutional food service is large scale
and often connected to governmental (National
Parks) or corporate level organizations. Often run
under a predetermined contract, the institutional
F&B sector includes:

 Hospitals
 Educational institutions
 Prisons and other detention facilities
 Corporate staff cafeterias
 National Park restaurants and concessions
 Cruise ships
 Airports and other transportation terminals and operations
Examples of companies who focus on Institutional Food Service are Compass, Sodexho,
Aramark.

Accommodation Food Service
This sector includes hotel restaurants and bars, room service, and self-serve dining
operations (such as a breakfast room). Hotel restaurants are usually open to the public and
reliant on this public patronage in addition to business from hotel guests. Collaborations
between hotel and restaurant chains have seen reliable pairings such as the combination of
Shula’s Steakhouse and Marriott Hotels.

Restaurant Industry Profitability and Cost Control
According to the National Restaurant Association, QSRs have the highest pre-tax profit
margin at 6.3%, while full-service restaurants have a margin of 4.7%. There will be significant
variances from these percentages at individual locations, even within the same brand. 380

A number of costs influence the profitability of an F&B operation. Some of the key
operating expenses (as a percentage of revenue) are detailed in Figure 15.16, above,
where food cost and salaries & wages are the two major expenses, each accounting for
approximately a third of the total. Other expenses include rental and leasing of venue, utilities,
advertising, and depreciation of assets. These percentages represent averages, and will vary
greatly by sector and location.
Cost control and containment is essential for all F&B businesses. Demanding particular
attention are the labor, food, and beverage costs, also known as the operator’s primary costs.

In addition to these big ticket items, there is the cost of reusable operating supplies such
as cutlery, glassware, china, and linen in full-service restaurants.

Recreation and Entertainment

Figure 15.17: Adventure tourism: Whitewater rafting in Turkey

Recreation
Recreation can be defined as the pursuit of leisure activities during one’s spare time382
and can include vastly different activities such as golfing, sport fishing, and rock climbing.
Defining recreation as it pertains to tourism, however, is more challenging.
Let’s start by exploring some recreation-based terms that are common in the tourism
industry. Outdoor recreation can be defined as “outdoor activities that take place in a natural
setting, as opposed to a highly cultivated or managed landscape such as a playing field or golf
course.”383 This term is typically applied to outdoor activities in which individuals engage close
to their community. When these activities are further away, and people must travel some
distance to participate in them, they are often described as “adventure tourism”. According to
the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), adventure tourism is “a trip that

350

Download this book for free at: http://hdl.handle.net/10919/70961 Chapter 15
Download the original source of this chapter at: http://open.bccampus.ca

includes at least two of the following three elements: physical activity, natural environment, and
cultural immersion.”384
Ultimately, categorization is based on a combination of several factors, including
manner of engagement in the activity (risk exposure, experience requirement, group or solo
activity), the distance travelled to access the activity, and the type of environment (proximity to
nature, level of challenge involved) in which the activity occurs.
A 2013 adventure tourism market study discovered that people who travel for adventure
experiences tend to be well-educated, with 48% holding a four-year degree or higher
credential. They value natural beauty and rank this factor highest when choosing a destination.
The most cited reasons for their travel are “relaxation, exploring new places, time with family,
and learning about different cultures.”385
Globally, it is estimated that the continents of Europe, North America, and South
America account for 70% of adventure tourism, or US$263 billion in adventure travel
spending.386

Entertainment
Entertainment is a very broad category which overlaps with many of the areas
discussed elsewhere in this chapter, like hotels and accommodation. Two major types of
entertainment that we’ll discuss here are gaming and theme parks.

Gaming
Gaming has grown significantly in the U.S. and globally. The number of casinos in the
U.S. has been growing since 2010, and in 2013, there were over 500 commercial casinos, as
shown in Figure 15.18. Casinos are found all over the U.S. in major cities, riverboats, and on
Native American lands. However, U.S. casino revenue has been relatively flat, while global
gaming revenues have been on the increase, largely due to Asian market growth. Most
casinos involve other facets of the Hospitality industry such as lodging, F&B, golf,
entertainment, spas, etc., but they also have the added challenges of casino operations.

Theme Parks

Figure 15.19: Fireworks

Theme parks have a long history dating back to the 1500’s
in Europe, and have evolved ever since. Today, it is hard not to
compare any amusement park destination to Disneyland and
Disney World. Opened in 1955 in sunny California, Disneyland set
the standard for theme parks. Theme parks outside of California
and Florida are often highly seasonable operations challenged with
significant staffing and training requirements each year.

Convention and Event Management
A convention is a large meeting of people with similar interests who meet for a period
of at least a few days to discuss their field. An event is a gathering at a given place and time,
usually of some importance, often celebrating or commemorating a special occasion.
Both conventions and events can be extremely complex projects, which is why, over
time, the role of meeting planners has taken on greater importance. The development of
education, training programs, and professional designations such as CMPs (Certified Meeting
Planners), CSEP (Certified Special Events Professional), and CMM (Certificate in Meeting
Management) has led to increased credibility in this business and demonstrates the
importance of the sector to the economy.
Meeting planners may be independent contractors hired to facilitate the planning
process, work directly for the company full time to coordinate their meeting, or work for hotels,
conference centers and event venues directly.
The various tasks involved in meeting and event planning include:

 Conceptualizing/theming
 Site inspection & selection
 Logistics and planning
 Human resource management
 Security
 Marketing and public relations
 Budgeting and financial management
 Sponsorship procurement
 Management and evaluation

Event Categories
Mega Events
A mega-event is a large scale, highly

Figure 15.20: Beijing National Stadium, site
of the Beijing Olympics opening and closing
ceremonies

prestigious event such as the Olympic Games,
the FIFA World Cup, or a global economic
summit. These events typically gain
tremendous media coverage and have major
economic impacts on the host location, both
positive and negative. High levels of tourism
(1 million+ visitors) associated with a megaevent brings revenue, but the revenue may be outweighed by substantial capital and social
costs incurred by the host. The events are often awarded to host destinations through a
bidding process and gain tremendous media coverage.

Special Events
A special event is a one-time or infrequent specific ritual, presentation, performance, or
celebration. Special events are planned and created to mark a special occasion, such as a
presidential inauguration or the Queen of England’s 90th birthday. Like mega-events, there
may be significant media coverage and economic impact for the host city or destination.

Hallmark Event

Figure 15.21: Mardi Gras in New Orleans

A hallmark event is a unique event that is
often identified with the location where it is held, like
Carnival in Rio de Janeiro or Oktoberfest in Munich.
Hallmark events contribute significant economic
benefits and even can create a competitive advantage
for the host city or destination that attracts tourists.

Festival
A festival is a themed public celebration that conveys, through a kaleidoscope of
activities, certain meaning to participants and spectators. Festivals are often celebrations of

community or culture and feature music, dance, or dramatic performances. Examples include
Lollapalooza, the Cannes Film Festival, and Junkanoo in the Bahamas.

Local Community Events
A local community event is generated by and for locals; although it may attract
tourists, its main audience is the local community. The community may experience measurable
economic impacts, as might happen at The Steppin’ Out Street Fair in Blacksburg (think hotel
stays and eating out). Fundraisers and community picnics are also examples in this category.

Meetings and Conventions
The tourism industry also has a long history of creating, hosting, and promoting
meetings and conventions that draw business travelers. In fact, Convention and Visitor
Bureau’s (CVB’s) work hard to attract these meetings and conventions to their city to drive
economic benefit for hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, etc.
There are several types of such events.

 Conventions generally have very large attendance, and are held on a regular
schedule but in different locations. They also often require a bidding
process. Political conventions are one such example.

 Association Meetings or Conferences are held regionally and nationally for
hundreds of associations or events focused on specific themes. Examples would
be the National Restaurant Association Annual Convention, ComicCon, or the
National Auto Show.

 Corporate Meetings will vary significantly in size and purpose and include
regional or national sales meetings, shareholder meetings, training sessions, or
celebrations. The location will vary depending on the nature of the meeting. They
may be held at an airport property, a traditional corporate meeting facility or even
an upscale resort.

 Trade Shows and Trade Fairs can be stand-alone events, or adjoin a
convention or conference.

 Seminars, Workshops, and Retreats are examples of smaller-scale events.

As meeting planners have become more creative, meeting and convention delegates
have been more demanding about meeting sites. No longer are hotel meeting rooms and
convention centers the only type of location used; non-traditional venues have adapted and
become competitive in offering services for meeting planners. These include architectural
spaces such as airplane hangars, warehouses, or rooftops and experiential venues such as
aquariums, museums, and galleries.387

Travel Services
Transportation and travel services are another large element of the tourism industry.
This area includes cruise ships, airlines, rail, car rentals, and even ride sharing such as Uber
and Lyft. Each of these segments is impacted significantly by fuel costs, safety issues, load
factors and government regulation.

Cruises
If you’ve ever been on a cruise, you are in good company. According to CLIA (Cruise
Lines International Association), 23 million passengers were expected to go on a cruise
worldwide on 62 member lines in 2015.388 The industry employs over 900,000 people.389
Over 55% of the world’s cruise passengers are from North America, and the leading
destinations (based on ship deployments),
according to CLIA are:390

Travel Services
The travel services sector is made up of a complex web of relationships between a
variety of suppliers, tourism products, destination marketing organizations, tour operators, and
travel agents, among many others. Under the North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS), the travel services industry group includes “establishments primarily engaged in
travel arrangement and reservation services. Examples … are tourist and travel agencies;
travel tour operators and wholesale operators; convention and visitors' bureaus; airline, bus,
railroad and steamship ticket offices; sports and theatrical ticket offices; and airline, hotel and
restaurant reservation offices.”391 Tourism services support industry development and the
delivery of guest experiences.

Travel Agencies
A travel agency is a business that operates as the intermediary between the travel
industry (supplier) and the traveler (purchaser). Part of the role of the travel agency is to
market prepackaged travel tours and holidays to potential travelers. The agency can further
function as a broker between the traveler and hotels, car rentals, and tour companies.392
Travel agencies can be small and privately owned or part of a larger entity.

Online travel agencies (OTAs)
Online travel agents (OTAs) are companies that aggregate accommodations and
transportation options and allow users to choose one or many components of their trip based
on price or other incentives. Examples of OTAs include Booking.com, Expedia.com,
Hotwire.com, and Kayak.com. OTAs are gaining popularity with the travelling public; in 2012,
they reported online sales of almost $100 billion393 and almost triple that figure, upward of
$278 billion, in 2013.394 Over 40% of U.S. travelers booked flights online in 2014.395

Tour operators
A tour operator packages all or most of the components of an offered trip and then
sells them to the traveler. These packages can also be sold through retail outlets or travel
agencies.396 Tour operators work closely with hotels, transportation providers, and attractions

in order to purchase large volumes of each component and package these at a better rate than
the traveler could by purchasing individually.

Destination marketing organizations (DMOs)
Destination marketing organizations (DMOs) include national tourism boards,
state/provincial tourism offices, and community convention and visitor bureaus around the
world. DMOs promote “the long-term development and marketing of a destination, focusing on
convention sales, tourism marketing and service”397.

Country Clubs
Country clubs are another part of the
Hospitality industry with a very different service

Figure 15.23: The Riviera Country Club
and Golf Course in Pacific Palisades,
California.

strategy focusing on serving members who will
develop relationships with the staff compared to a
more transactional service interaction in lodging,
restaurants or airlines.
Country clubs do not focus as strongly on
profit as they do on maximizing member
satisfaction, retention and growth while maintaining
an attractive fee structure. Country (or city) clubs,
will typically have restaurant and bar operations,
catered events and other amenities such as golf, tennis, pool, fitness facilities, etc. Depending
on the type of club, family and youth events are important to maintain and grow membership.
Strong customer service, culinary, event management and general management skills
are necessary to be successful in clubs.

Key Take-Aways
1)

The Tourism industry is the largest industry in the world with
significant benefit and costs to a region. The global competition for the
tourism dollar is significant within the US and between countries.

2)

Hotels vary significantly in size, quality, purpose, chain affiliation, and
ownership. The complexity of the operation and leadership vary as
well. Careers are available in traditional operations positions (Rooms,
F&B, Events, Sales) but also in Finance, Human Resources, Revenue
Management, Training, Asset Management and corporate support
positions.

3)

Food and Beverage is made up of a wide variety of restaurant types
from QSR, Fast Casual, Fine Dining and Ethnic. Institutional food
service in business, hospitals, education, parks and concessions are
a significant part of the Food and Beverage industry.

4)

The evolution of tastes and consumer expectations in food and
beverage continue to provide opportunity and challenges in the
industry for ethnic sustainable, organic, local, craft, and other unique
experiences.

Figure 76.1: Apple Headquarters in Cupertino, California

Apple Inc. is the most valuable company in the world. This statement is based on
market value, which in June 2016 was roughly $500 billion. Although markets can fluctuate,
sometimes wildly, if you are reading this chapter for a course later in 2016 or in 2017, it is not
unlikely that Apple will have retained its leadership position. Its value as of June 2016 was
more than $40 billion greater than that of the next largest company, Alphabet, the parent
company of Google. Apple has briefly ceded the leadership position to Alphabet on a couple of
occasions, but for the most part, it has been the leader for quite some time.398
You may wonder what kind of information is used to make these determinations. How
does the market know that Apple should be valued more than $100 billion higher than ExxonMobil, for example?399 Do investors just make their decisions on instinct? Well, some do, but
it’s not a formula for sustained success. In most cases, in deciding how much to pay for a
company, investors rely on published accounting and financial information released by
publicly-traded companies. This chapter will introduce you to the subject of accounting and
financial information so you can begin to get an understanding for how the valuation process
works.

The Role of Accounting
Accounting is often called “the language of business” because it communicates so
much of the information that owners, managers, and investors need to evaluate a company’s
financial performance. These people are stakeholders in the business—they’re interested in its
activities because they’re affected by them. The financial futures of owners and other investors
may depend heavily on strong financial performance from the business, and when
performance is poor, managers may be replaced or laid off in a downsizing. In fact, a key
purpose of accounting is to help stakeholders make better business decisions by providing
them with financial information. You shouldn’t try to run an organization or make investment
decisions without accurate and timely financial information, and it is the accountant who
prepares this information. More importantly, accountants make sure that stakeholders
understand the meaning of financial information, and they work with both individuals and
organizations to help them use financial information to deal with business problems. Actually,
collecting all the numbers is the easy part. The hard part is analyzing, interpreting, and
communicating the information. Of course, you also have to present everything clearly while
effectively interacting with people from every business discipline. In any case, we’re now ready
to define accounting as the process of measuring and summarizing business activities,
interpreting financial information, and communicating the results to management and other
decision makers.

Fields of Accounting
Accountants typically work in one of two major fields. Management accountants
provide information and analysis to decision makers inside the organization in order to help
them run it. Financial accountants furnish information to individuals and groups both inside
and outside the organization in order to help them assess its financial performance. Their
primary focus, however, is on external parties. In other words, management accounting helps
you keep your business running while financial accounting tells the outside world how well
you’re running it.

Management Accounting
Management accounting, also known as managerial accounting, plays a key role in
helping managers carry out their responsibilities. Because the information that it provides is
intended for use by people who perform a wide variety of jobs, the format for reporting
information is flexible. Reports are tailored to the needs of individual managers, and the
purpose of such reports is to supply relevant, accurate, timely information that will aid
managers in making decisions. In preparing, analyzing, and communicating such information,
accountants work with individuals from all the functional areas of the organization—human
resources, operations, marketing, etc.
Figure 16.2: The role of Managerial accounting

Financial Accounting
Financial accounting is responsible for preparing the organization’s financial
statements—including the income statement, the statement of owner’s equity, the
balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows—that summarize a company’s past
performance and evaluate its current financial condition. If a company is traded publicly on a
stock market such as the NASDAQ, these financial statements must be made public, which is

not true of the internal reports produced by management accountants. In preparing financial
statements, financial accountants adhere to a uniform set of rules called generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP)—the basic principles for financial reporting issued by an
independent agency called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Users want
to be sure that financial statements have been prepared according to GAAP because they
want to be sure that the information reported in them is accurate. They also know that when
financial statements have been prepared by the same rules, they can be compared from one
company to another.
While companies headquartered in the United States follow U.S.-based GAAP, many
companies located outside the United States follow a different set of accounting principles
called International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These multinational standards,
which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), differ from U.S.
GAAP in a number of important ways, but we’re not at the point yet of exploring these
sometimes fine distinctions. Bear in mind, however, that, according to most experts, a single
set of worldwide standards will eventually emerge to govern the accounting practices of both
U.S. and non-U.S. companies.

Who Uses Financial Accounting Information?
The users of managerial accounting information are pretty easy to identify—basically,
they’re a firm’s managers. We need to look a little more closely, however, at the users of
financial accounting information, and we also need to know a little more about what they do
with the information that accountants provide them.

Owners and Managers
In summarizing the outcomes of a company’s financial activities over a specified period
of time, financial statements are, in effect, report cards for owners and managers. They show,
for example, whether the company did or didn’t make a profit and furnish other information
about the firm’s financial condition. They also provide some information that managers and
owners can use in order to take corrective action, though reports produced by management
accountants offer a much greater level of depth.

Investors and Creditors
Investors and creditors furnish the money that a

Figure16.3: Warren Buffet,

company needs to operate, and not surprisingly, they want to
know how that business is performing. Because they know that
it’s impossible to make smart investment and loan decisions
without accurate reports on an organization’s financial health,
they study financial statements to assess a company’s
performance and to make decisions about continued
investment.
According to the world’s most successful investor,
Warren Buffett, the best way to prepare yourself to be an
investor is to learn all the accounting you can. Buffett, chairman
and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a company that invests in
other companies, turned an original investment of $10,000 into a net worth of $66

billion400 in four decades, and he did it, in large part, by paying close attention to financial
accounting reports.

Government Agencies
Businesses are required to furnish financial information to a number of government
agencies. Publicly-owned companies, for example—the ones whose shares are traded on a
stock exchange—must provide annual financial reports to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), a federal agency that regulates stock trades and which is charged with
ensuring that companies tell the truth with respect to their financial positions. Companies must
also provide financial information to local, state, and federal taxing agencies, including the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Other Users
A number of other external users have an interest in a company’s financial statements.
Suppliers, for example, need to know if the company to which they sell their goods is having
trouble paying its bills or may even be at risk of going under. Employees and labor unions are
interested because salaries and other forms of compensation are dependent on an employer’s
performance.
Figures 16.2 and 16.4 illustrate the main users of management and financial accounting
and the types of information produced by accountants in the two areas. In the rest of this
chapter, we’ll learn how to prepare a set of financial statements and how to interpret them.
We’ll also discuss issues of ethics in the accounting communities and career opportunities in
the accounting profession.

Understanding Financial Statements
We hope that, so far, at least one thing is clear: If you’re in business, you need to
understand financial statements. The law no longer allows high-ranking executives to plead
ignorance or fall back on delegation of authority when it comes to responsibility for a firm’s
financial reporting. In a business environment tainted by episodes of fraudulent financial

366

Chapter 16

reporting and other corporate misdeeds, top managers are now being held responsible for the
financial statements issued by the people who report to them. Top managers need to know
how well the company is performing. Financial information helps managers identify signs of
impending trouble before it is too late.

The Function of Financial Statements
Put yourself in the place of Connie in Figure 16.5 on the next page, who runs Connie’s
Confections out of her home. She loves what she does, and she feels that she’s doing pretty
well. In fact, she has an opportunity to take over a nearby store at very reasonable rent, and
she can expand by getting a modest bank loan and investing some more of her own money.
So it’s decision time for Connie: She knows that the survival rate for start-ups isn’t very good,
and before taking the next step, she’d like to get a better idea of whether she’s actually doing
well enough to justify the risk. The basic financial statements will give her some answers.
Since this book is for an introductory course, we will focus our attention on the income
statement and balance sheet only, even though we mentioned other financial statements
earlier in the chapter.

Toying with a Business Idea
To bring this concept closer to home, let’s assume that you need to earn money while
you’re in college and that you’ve decided to start a small business. Your business will involve
selling stuff to other college students, and to keep things simple, we’ll assume that you’re
going to operate on a “cash” basis: you’ll pay for everything with cash, and everyone who buys
something from you will pay in cash.
You may have at least a little cash on you right now—some currency, or paper money,
and coins. In accounting, however, the term cash refers to more than just paper money and
coins. It also refers to the money that you have in checking and savings accounts and includes
items that you can deposit in these accounts, such as money orders and different types of
checks.

Chapter 16

Your first task is to decide exactly what you’re going to sell. You’ve noticed that with
homework, exams, social commitments, and the hectic lifestyle of the average college student,
you and most of the people you know always seem to be under a lot of stress. Sometimes you
wish you could just lie back between meals and bounce a ball off the wall. And that’s when the
idea hits you: Maybe you could make some money by selling a product called the “StressBuster Play Pack.” Here’s what you have in mind: you’ll buy small toys and other fun stuff—
instant stress relievers—at a local dollar store and pack them in a rainbow-colored plastic
treasure chest labeled “Stress-Buster.”
And here’s where you stand: You have enough cash to buy a month’s worth of plastic
treasure chests and toys. After that, you’ll use the cash generated from sales of Stress-Buster
Play Packs to replenish your supply. Each plastic chest will cost $1.00, and you’ll fill each one
with a variety of five simple toys, all of which you can buy for $1.00 each.
You plan to sell each Stress-Buster Play Pack for $10 from a rented table stationed
outside a major dining hall. Renting the table will cost you $20 a month. In order to make sure
you can complete your school work, you decide to hire fellow students to staff the table at peak
traffic periods. They’ll be on duty from noon until 2:00 p.m. each weekday except Fridays, and
you’ll pay them a generous $7.50 an hour. Wages, therefore, will cost you $240 a month (2
hours × 4 days × 4 weeks = 32 hours × $7.50). Finally, you’ll run ads in the college newspaper
at a monthly cost of $40. Thus your total monthly costs will amount to $300 ($20 + $240 +
$40).

The Income Statement
Let’s say that during your first month, you sell one hundred play packs. Not bad, you
say to yourself, but did I make a profit? To find out, you prepare an income statement showing
revenues, or sales, and expenses—the costs of doing business. You divide your expenses
into two categories:

 Cost of goods sold: the total cost of the goods that you’ve sold
 Operating expenses: the costs of operating your business except for the costs
of things that you’ve sold.

Now you need to do some subtracting:

 The difference between sales and cost of goods sold is your gross profit, also
known as gross margin.

 The difference between gross profit and operating expenses is your net income
or profit, which is the proverbial “bottom line.” Note we’ve assumed you’re
making money, but businesses can also have a net loss.
Figure 16.6 is your income statement for the first month. (Remember that we’ve made
things simpler by handling everything in cash.)

Did You Make Any Money?
What does your income statement tell you? It has provided you with four pieces of valuable
information:
1) You sold 100 units at $10 each, bringing in revenues or sales of $1,000.
2) Each unit that you sold cost you $6—$1 for the treasure chest plus 5 toys costing $1
each. So your cost of goods sold is $600 (100 units × $6 per unit).
3) Your gross profit—the amount left after subtracting cost of goods sold from sales—is
$400 (100 units × $4 each).
4) After subtracting operating expenses of $300—the costs of doing business other
than the cost of products sold—you generated a positive net income or profit of
$100.

The Balance Sheet
A balance sheet reports the following information:

 Assets: the resources from which it expects to gain some future benefit
 Liabilities: the debts that it owes to outside individuals or organizations
 Owner’s equity: the investment in the business
Whereas your income statement tells you how much income you earned over some
period of time, your balance sheet tells you what you have at a specific point in time.
Companies prepare financial statements on at least a twelve-month basis—that is, for a
fiscal year which ends on December 31 or some other logical date, such as June 30 or
September 30. Fiscal years can vary because companies generally pick a fiscal-year end date
that coincides with the end of a peak selling period; thus a crabmeat processor might end its
fiscal year in October, when the crab supply has dwindled. Most companies also produce
financial statements on a quarterly or monthly basis. For Stress-Buster, you’ll want to prepare
them monthly to stay on top of how your new business is doing. Let’s prepare a balance sheet
at the start and end of your first month in business.

The Accounting Equation
To prepare a balance sheet, one must first understand the fundamental accounting
equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity
This simple but important equation highlights the fact that a company’s assets came
from somewhere: either from investments made by the owners (owner’s equity) or from loans
(liabilities). This means that the asset section of the balance sheet on the one hand and the
liability and owner’s-equity section on the other must be equal, or balance. Thus the term
balance sheet.
Let’s prepare the two balance sheets we mentioned: one for the first day you started
and one for the end of your first month of business. We’ll assume that when you started
Stress-Buster, you borrowed $400 from your parents and put in $200 of your own money. If
you look at your first balance sheet in Figure 16.7, you’ll see that your business has $600 in
cash (your assets): Of this total, you borrowed $400 (your liabilities) and invested $200 of your
own money (your owner’s equity). So far, so good: your assets section balances with your
liabilities and owner’s equity section as follows:

Chapter 16

Now let’s see how things have changed by the end of the month. Recall that StressBuster earned $100 during the month of September and that you decided to leave these
earnings in the business. This $100 profit increases two items on your balance sheet: the
assets of the company (its cash) and your investment in it (its owner’s equity). Figure 16.8
shows what your balance sheet will look like on September 30. You now have $700 in cash:
$400 that you borrowed plus $300 that you’ve invested in the business (your original $200
investment plus the $100 profit from the first month of operations, which you’ve kept in the
business).

Breakeven Analysis
Let’s take a short detour to see how this information might be put to use. As you look at
your first financial statements, you might ask yourself: is there some way to figure out the level
of sales you need to avoid losing money—to “break even”? This can be done using breakeven
analysis. To break even (have no profit or loss), your total sales revenue must exactly equal
all your expenses (both variable and fixed). Variable costs depend on the quantity produced

Chapter 16

373

and sold; for example, each Stress-Buster includes the treasure chest and the toys inside.
Fixed costs don’t change as the quantity sold changes; for example, you’ll pay for your
advertising whether you sell Stress-Busters or not. The balance between revenue and
expenses will occur when gross profit equals all other (fixed) costs. To determine the level of
sales at which this will occur, you need to do the following (using data from the previous
example):
1) Determine your total fixed costs:
Fixed costs = $240 salaries + $40 advertising + $20 table = $300
2) Identify your variable costs on a per-unit basis:
Variable cost per unit = $6 ($1 for the treasure chest and $5 for the toys)
3) Determine your contribution margin per unit: selling price per unit – variable
cost per unit:
Contribution margin = $10 selling price – $6 variable cost per unit = $4
4) Calculate your breakeven point in units: fixed costs ÷ contribution margin per
unit:
Breakeven in units = $300 fixed costs ÷ $4 contribution margin per unit =
75 units
Your calculation means that if you sell 75 units, you’ll end up with zero profit (or loss) and will
exactly break even. To test your calculation, you can prepare a what-if income statement for
75 units in sales (your breakeven number). The resulting statement is shown in Figure 16.9.
Of course you want to do better than just break even, so you could modify this analysis
to a targeted level of profit by adding that amount to your fixed costs and repeating the
calculation. Breakeven analysis is rather handy. It enables you to determine the level of sales
that you must reach to avoid losing money and the level of sales that you have to reach to earn
a certain profit. Such information will be vital to planning your business.

Financial Statement Analysis
Now that you know a bit about financial statements, let’s see how they’re used to help
owners, managers, investors, and creditors assess a firm’s performance and financial strength.
You can glean a wealth of information from financial statements, but first you need to learn a
few basic principles for “unlocking” it.

Trend Analysis from the Income Statement
Figure 16.10 is an abbreviated financial statement for Apple for 2014 taken directly from
their website. You will note that instead of showing only the current year’s results, the
company has shown data for the prior two years as well.
From this relatively simple exhibit, considerable information about Apple’s performance
can be obtained. For example:



Apple sales grew at 6.95% from 2013 to 2014, not bad for a company with such
a large base of sales already, but certainly not the rapid-growth company it once
was.



Net income as a percent of sales (a ratio also known as return on sales) was
21.6% - or in other words, for every $5 in sales, Apple turned more than $1 of it
into profit. That is substantial!

Many other calculations are possible from Apple’s data, and we will look at a few more
as we explore ratio analysis.

Ratio Analysis
How do you compare Apple’s financial results with those of other companies in your
industry or with the other companies whose stock is available to investors? And what about
your balance sheet? Are there relationships on this statement that also warrant investigation?
These issues can be explored by using ratio analysis, a technique for evaluating a company’s
financial performance.
Remember that a ratio is just one number divided by another, with the result expressing
the relationship between the two numbers. It’s hard to learn much from just one ratio, or even a
number of ratios covering the same period. Rather, the deeper value in ratio analysis lies in
looking at the trend of ratios over time and in comparing the ratios for several time periods with
those of other companies. There are a number of different ways to categorize financial ratios.

Here’s one set of categories:



Profitability ratios tell you how much profit is made relative to the amount
invested (return on investment) or the amount sold (return on sales).



Liquidity ratios tell you how well positioned a company is to pay its bills in the
near term. Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be turned into cash. For
example, share of stock is substantially more liquid than a building or a machine.



Debt ratios look at how much borrowing a company has done in order to finance
the operations of the business. The more borrowing, the more risk a company
has taken on, and so the less likely it would be for new lenders to approve loan
applications.



Efficiency ratios tell you how well your assets are being managed.

We could employ many different ratios, but we’ll focus on a few key examples.

Profitability Ratios
Earlier we looked at the return on sales for Apple. Another profitability ratio on which
the financial markets focus is earnings per share, also known as EPS. This ratio divides net
income by the number of shares of stock outstanding. According to the earlier exhibit, Apple
increased its EPS from $5.72 in 2013 to $6.49 in 2014, which indicates growth of about 13% -excellent for a company that is already among the world’s largest. Well-paid analysts will
spend hours to understand how these results were achieved every time Apple issues new
financial statements.

Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios are one element of measuring the financial strength of a company. They
assess its ability to pay its current bills. A key liquidity ratio is called the current ratio. It simply
examines the relationship between a company’s current assets and its current liabilities. On
September 27, 2014 (remember that balance sheets reflect a point in time), Apple had $68.5
billion in current assets and $63.4 billion in current liabilities. Simply, what this means is that
Apple has more money on hand than they need to pay their bills. When a company has a
current ratio greater than 1, they are in good shape to pay their bills; companies selling to
Apple on credit would not need to worry that it is likely to run out of money.

Apple’s current ratio:

$68.5 Billion
$63.4 Billion

= 1.08 >1

Now, let’s look quickly at something that is not part of the ratio; look down one line on the
balance sheet to long-term marketable securities and see that Apple owns $130.2 billion.
While they are long term and so not part of the current ratio, these securities are still easily
convertible to cash. So Apple has far more cushion than the current ratio reflects, even though
it reflected a healthy financial position already.

Debt Ratios
A key debt ratio, which tells us how the company is financed, is the debt-to-equity
ratio, which calculates the relationship between funds acquired from creditors (debt) and
funds invested by owners (equity). For this ratio calculation, we use Apple’s total liabilities, not
just the line on the balance sheet that says long-term debt, because in effect, Apple is
borrowing from those who it owes but has not yet paid. Apple’s total liabilities at the end of its
2014 fiscal year were $120.3 billion versus owner’s equity of $111.5 billion, a ratio of 1.08,
which means Apple has borrowed more than it has invested in the business.

Apple’s debt to equity ratio:

$120.3 Billion
$111.5 Billion

= 1.08

To some investors, that high level of debt might seem alarming. But remember that
Apple has $130.2 billion invested in marketable securities. If it wished to do so, Apple could
sell some of those securities and pay down its debts, thus improving its ratio. It’s likely that
anyone thinking about lending money to Apple and seeing these figures would be confident
that Apple has the ability to pay back what they borrow.

Efficiency and Effectiveness Ratios
There are many more ratios which we could apply to Apple to more completely
understand its performance. Yet going deeper into ratios would be beyond the scope of an
introductory business course. If you continue your study of business, you will get ample
exposure to these ratios in your accounting and finance courses. So we’ll leave the rest for
another day.

The World of Personal Credit
Do you sometimes wonder where your

money goes? Do you worry about how you’ll
pay off your student loans? Would you like to
buy a new car or even a home someday and
you’re not sure where you’ll get the money? If
these questions seem familiar to you, you could
benefit from help in managing your personal
finances, which this chapter will seek to
provide.
Let’s say that you’re twenty-eight and
single. You have a good education and a good
job—you’re pulling down $60K working with a
local accounting firm. You have $6,000 in a
retirement savings account, and you carry
three credit cards. You plan to buy a condo in two or three years, and you want to take your
dream trip to the world’s hottest surfing spots within five years. Your only big worry is the fact
that you’re $70,000 in debt, due to student loans, your car loan, and credit card debt. In fact,
even though you’ve been gainfully employed for a total of six years now, you haven’t been able
to make a dent in that $70,000. You can afford the necessities of life and then some, but
you’ve occasionally wondered if you’re ever going to have enough income to put something
toward that debt.401
Now let’s suppose that while browsing through a magazine in the doctor’s office, you run
across a short personal-finances self-help quiz. There are six questions:

Chapter 17

You took the quiz and answered with a B or C to a few questions, and are thereby
informed that you’re probably jeopardizing your entire financial future.
Personal-finances experts tend to utilize the types of questions on the quiz: if you
answered B or C to any of the first three questions, you have a problem with splurging; if any
questions from four through six got a B or C, your monthly bills are too high for your income.

Building a Good Credit Rating
So, you have a financial problem. According to the quick test you took, you splurge and
your bills are too high for your income. If you get in over your head and can’t make your loan or
rent payments on time, you risk hurting your credit rating—your ability to borrow in the future.
How do potential lenders decide whether you’re a good or bad credit risk? If you’re a
poor credit risk, how does this affect your ability to borrow, or the rate of interest you have to
pay? Whenever you use credit, those from whom you borrow (retailers, credit card
companies, banks) provide information on your debt and payment habits to three national
credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The credit bureaus use the information to
compile a numerical credit score, called a FICO score; it ranges from 300 to 850, with the
majority of people falling in the 600–700 range. In compiling the score, the credit bureaus
consider five criteria: payment history—paying your bills on time (the most important), total
amount owed, length of your credit history, amount of new credit you have, and types of

credit you use. The credit bureaus share their

score and other information about your credit
history with their subscribers.402
So what does this do for you? It depends. If
you pay your bills on time and don’t borrow too
heavily, you’d likely have a high FICO score and
lenders would like you, probably giving you
reasonable interest rates on the loans you
requested. But if your FICO score is low, lenders
won’t likely lend you money (or would lend it to you
at high interest rates). A low FICO score can even
affect your chances of renting an apartment or
landing a particular job. So it’s very important that
you do everything possible to earn and maintain a
high credit score.
As a young person, though, how do you
build a credit history that will give you a high FICO
score? Based on feedback from several financial
experts, Emily Starbuck Gerson and Jeremy Simon
of CreditCards.com compiled the list in Figure 17.4 of ways students can build good credit.403
If you meet the qualifications to obtain your own credit card, look for a card with a low
interest rate and no annual fee.

A Few More Words about Debt
What should you do to turn things around—to start getting out of debt? According to
many experts, you need to take two steps:

386

1)

Cut up your credit cards and start living on a cash-only basis.

2)

Do whatever you can to bring down your monthly bills.

then moving to a pay-as-you go basis, i.e., cash or debit card only, may be for you. Be honest
with yourself; if you can’t handle credit, then don’t use it.

Bringing Down Those Monthly Bills
So what can you can to bring down your monthly bills? If you want to take a gradual
approach, one financial planner suggests that you perform the following “exercises” for one
week:404

 Keep a written record of everything you spend and total it at week’s end.
 Keep all your ATM receipts and count up the fees.
 Take $100 out of the bank and don’t spend a penny more.
 Avoid gourmet coffee shops.
You’ll probably be surprised at how much of your money can quickly become somebody
else’s money. If, for example, you spend $3 every day for one cup of coffee at a coffee shop,
you’re laying out nearly $1,100 a year just for coffee. If you use your ATM card at a bank other
than your own, you’ll probably be charged a fee that can be as
high as $3. The average person pays more than $60 a year in

Figure 17.5: These can
really add up quickly!

ATM fees. If you withdraw cash from an ATM twice a week, you
could be racking up $300 in annual fees.405 Another idea – eat
out as a reward, not as a rule. A sandwich or leftovers from home
can be just as tasty and can save you $6 to $10 a day, even
more than our number for coffee! In 2013, the website DailyWorth
asked three women to try to cut their spending in half. After
tracking her spending, one participant discovered that she had
spent $175 eating out in just one week; do that for a year and
you’d spend over $9,000!406 If you think your cable bill is too high,
consider alternatives like Playstation Vue or Sling. Changing
channels is a bit different, but the savings can be substantial.

You may or may not be among the American consumers who buy thirty-five million cans
of Bud Light each day, or 150,000 pounds of Starbucks coffee, or 2.4 million Burger King
hamburgers. Yours may not be one of the 70 percent of U.S. households with an unopened
consumer-electronics product lying around.407 Bottom line - if, at age twenty-eight, you have a
good education and a good job, a $60,000 income, and a $70,000 debt—by no means an
implausible scenario—there’s a very good reason why you should think hard about controlling
your debt: your level of indebtedness will be a key factor in your ability—or inability—to reach
your longer-term financial goals, such as home ownership, a dream trip, and, perhaps most
importantly, a reasonably comfortable retirement.

Financial Planning
Before we go any further, we need to nail down a couple of key concepts. First, just
what, exactly, do we mean by personal finances? Finance itself concerns the flow of money
from one place to another, and your personal finances concern your money and what you plan
to do with it as it flows in and out of your possession. Essentially, then, personal finance is the
application of financial principles to the monetary decisions that you make either for your
individual benefit or for that of your family.
Second, as we suggested earlier, monetary decisions work out much more beneficially
when they’re planned rather than improvised. Thus our emphasis on financial planning—the
ongoing process of managing your personal finances in order to meet goals that you’ve set for
yourself or your family.
Financial planning requires you to address several questions, some of them relatively
simple:

388



What’s my annual income?



How much debt do I have, and what are my monthly payments on that debt?

Chapter 17

Others will require some investigation and calculation:



What’s the value of my assets?



How can I best budget my annual income?

Still others will require some forethought and forecasting:



How much wealth can I expect to accumulate during my working lifetime?



How much money will I need when I retire?

The Financial Planning Life Cycle
Another question that you might ask yourself—and certainly would do if you worked with
a professional in financial planning—is: “How will my financial plans change over the course of
my life?” Figure 17.6 illustrates the financial life cycle of a typical individual—one whose
financial outlook and likely outcomes are probably a lot like yours.408 As you can see, our
diagram divides this individual’s life into three stages, each of which is characterized by
different life events (such as beginning a family, buying a home, planning an estate, retiring).
At each stage, there are recommended changes in the focus of the individual’s financial
planning:

 Stage 1 focuses on building wealth.
 Stage 2 shifts the focus to the process of preserving and increasing wealth that
one has accumulated and continues to accumulate.

 In Stage 3, the focus turns to the process of living on (and, if possible, continuing
to grow) one’s saved wealth after retirement.
At each stage, of course, complications can set in—changes in such conditions as
marital or employment status or in the overall economic outlook, for example. Finally, as you
can also see, your financial needs will probably peak somewhere in stage 2, at approximately
age fifty-five, or ten years before typical retirement age.

Figure 17.6: The Financial Life Cycle

Choosing a Career
Until you’re on your own and working, you’re probably living on your parents’ wealth
right now. In our hypothetical life cycle, financial planning begins in the individual’s early
twenties. If that seems like rushing things, consider a basic fact of life: this is the age at which
you’ll be choosing your career—not only the sort of work you want to do during your prime
income-generating years, but also the kind of lifestyle you want to live. What about college?
Most readers of this book, of course, have decided to go to college. If you haven’t yet decided,
you need to know that college is an extremely good investment of both money and time.
Figure 17.7 summarizes the findings of a study conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau.409 A quick review shows that people who graduate from high school can expect to
enjoy average annual earnings about 28 percent higher than those of people who don’t, and
those who go on to finish college can expect to generate 76 percent more annual income than
high school graduates who didn’t attend college. Over the course of the financial life cycle,

families headed by those college graduates will earn about $1.6 million more410 than families
headed by high school graduates. (With better access to health care—and, studies show, with
better dietary and health practices—college graduates will also live longer. And so will their
children.)411

What about the student-loan debt that so many people accumulate? For every $1 that
you spend on your college education, you can expect to earn about $35 during the course of
your financial life cycle.412 At that rate of return, you should be able to pay off your student
loans (unless, of course, you fail to practice reasonable financial planning).
Naturally, there are exceptions to these average outcomes. You’ll find some college
graduates stocking shelves at 7-Eleven, and you’ll find college dropouts running multibilliondollar enterprises. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates dropped out of college after two years, as
did his founding partner, Paul Allen. Though exceptions to rules (and average outcomes)
certainly can be found, they fall far short of disproving them: in entrepreneurship as in most
other walks of adult life, the better your education, the more promising your financial future.
One expert in the field puts the case for the average person bluntly: educational credentials
“are about being employable, becoming a legitimate candidate for a job with a future. They are
about climbing out of the dead-end job market.”413

Time Is Money
The fact that you have to choose a career at an early stage in your financial life cycle
isn’t the only reason that you need to start early on your financial planning. Let’s assume, for
instance, that it’s your eighteenth birthday and that on this day you take possession of $10,000
that your grandparents put in trust for you. You could, of course, spend it; in particular, it would
probably cover the cost of flight training for a private pilot’s license—something you’ve always
wanted but were convinced that you couldn’t afford right away. Your grandfather, of course,
suggests that you put it into some kind of savings account. If you just wait until you finish
college, he says, and if you can find a savings plan that pays 5 percent interest, you’ll have the
$10,000 plus about another $2,000 for something else or to invest.
The total amount you’ll have— $12,000—piques your interest. If that $10,000 could turn
itself into $12,000 after sitting around for four years, what would it be worth if you actually held
on to it until you did retire—say, at age sixty-five? A quick trip to the Internet to find a
compound-interest calculator informs you that, forty-seven years later, your $10,000 will have
grown to $104,345 (assuming a 5 percent interest rate). That’s not really enough for retirement
on, but it would be a good start. On the other hand, what if that four years in college had paid
off the way you planned, so that once you get a good job you’re able to add, say, another
$10,000 to your retirement savings account every year until age sixty-five? At that rate, you’ll
have amassed a nice little nest egg of slightly more than $1.6 million.

Compound Interest
In your efforts to appreciate the potential of your $10,000 to multiply itself, you have
acquainted yourself with two of the most important concepts in finance. As we’ve already
indicated, one is the principle of compound interest, which refers to the effect of earning
interest on your interest.
Let’s say, for example, that you take your grandfather’s advice and invest your $10,000
(your principal) in a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5 percent. Over the course of
the first year, your investment will earn $500 in interest and grow to $10,500. If you now

392

Chapter 17

reinvest the entire $10,500 at the same 5 percent annual rate, you’ll earn another $525 in
interest, giving you a total investment at the end of year 2 of $11,025. And so forth. And that’s
how you can end up with $81,496.67 at age sixty-five.

Time Value of Money
You’ve also encountered the principle of the time value of money—the principle
whereby a dollar received in the present is worth more than a dollar received in the future. If
there’s one thing that we’ve stressed throughout this chapter so far, it’s the fact that most
people prefer to consume now rather than in the future. If you borrow money from me, it’s
because you can’t otherwise buy something that you want at the present time. If I lend it to
you, I must forego my opportunity to purchase something I want at the present time. I will do so
only if I can get some compensation for making that sacrifice, and that’s why I’m going to
charge you interest. And you’re going to pay the interest because you need the money to buy
what you want to buy now. How much interest should we agree on? In theory, it could be just
enough to cover the cost of my lost opportunity, but there are, of course, other factors.
Inflation, for example, will have eroded the value of my money by the time I get it back from
you. In addition, while I would be taking no risk in loaning money to the U.S. government, I am
taking a risk in lending it to you. Our agreed-on rate will reflect such factors.414
Finally, the time value of money principle also states that a dollar received today starts
earning interest sooner than one received tomorrow. Let’s say, for example, that you receive
$2,000 in cash gifts when you graduate from college. At age twenty-three, with your college
degree in hand, you get a decent job and don’t have an immediate need for that $2,000. So
you put it into an account that pays 10 percent compounded and you add another $2,000
($167 per month) to your account every year for the next eleven years.415 The blue line in
Figure 17.8 graphs how much your account will earn each year and how much money you’ll
have at certain ages between twenty-four and sixty-seven.
As you can see, you’d have nearly $52,000 at age thirty-six and a little more than
$196,000 at age fifty; at age sixty-seven, you’d be just a bit short of $1 million. The yellow line
in the graph shows what you’d have if you hadn’t started saving $2,000 a year until you were
age thirty-six. As you can also see, you’d have a respectable sum at age sixty-seven—but less
than half of what you would have accumulated by starting at age twenty-three. More important,

Chapter 17

393

even to accumulate that much, you’d have to add $2,000 per year for a total of thirty-two years,
not just twelve.
Here’s another way of looking at the same principle. Suppose that you’re twenty years
old, don’t have $2,000, and don’t want to attend college full-time. You are, however, a hard
worker and a conscientious saver, and one of your financial goals is to accumulate a $1 million
retirement nest egg. As a matter of fact, if you can put $33 a month into an account that pays
12 percent interest compounded,416 you can have your $1 million by age sixty-seven. That is, if
you start at age twenty. As you can see from Figure 17.9, if you wait until you’re twenty-one to
start saving, you’ll need $37 a month. If you wait until you’re thirty, you’ll have to save $109 a
month, and if you procrastinate until you’re forty, the ante goes up to $366 a month. 417
Unfortunately in today’s low interest rate environment, finding 10 to 12% return is not likely.
Nevertheless, these figures illustrate the significant benefit of saving early.

The reason should be fairly obvious: a dollar saved today not only starts earning interest
sooner than one saved tomorrow (or ten years from now) but also can ultimately earn a lot
more money in the long run. Starting early means in your twenties—early in stage 1 of your
financial life cycle. As one well-known financial advisor puts it, “If you’re in your 20s and you
haven’t yet learned how to delay gratification, your life is likely to be a constant financial
struggle.”418

but interest rates on such accounts can

and usually require a level of funds
available that most students don’t have. In
those cases, mutual funds can be quite
interesting. A mutual fund is a
professionally managed investment
program in which shareholders buy into a
group of diversified holdings, such as
stocks and bonds. Companies like
Vanguard and Fidelity offer a range of
investment options including indexed
funds, which track with well-known indices
such as the Standard & Poors 500, a.k.a.

the S&P 500. Minimum investment levels in such funds can actually be within the reach of
many students, and the funds accept electronic transfers to make investing more convenient.
We’ll leave a more detailed discussion of investment vehicles to your more advanced courses.
