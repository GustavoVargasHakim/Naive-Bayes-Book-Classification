Introduction
To be successful in Intermediate Financial Accounting, it is imperative for a student to have
a strong foundational knowledge of all Introductory Financial Accounting concepts. The
purpose of Lesson 1 is to help a student identify any weaknesses in their Intro Accounting
knowledge. Lesson 1 consists of a series of labs intended to help a student identify any
knowledge gaps. If a weakness comes to light, the student is encouraged to go back
to that concept in Intro Accounting and review in detail. It is the student’s responsibility
to ensure they come into Intermediate Financial Accounting with the appropriate prerequisite knowledge.
Each section will provide a link to the open Introduction to Financial Accounting textbook
by Dauderis and Annand. You may also access the textbook by visiting http://lifa1.

Why Accounting?

It Was No Joke
Perhaps the timing was intentional. On April 2, 2009, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) in the United States voted to amend the accounting rules for
financial instruments. In particular, the changes in the rules allowed banks and their
auditors to apply “significant judgment” in the valuation of certain illiquid mortgage
assets.
The issue arose directly as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. After the housing
bubble of the early- to mid-2000s burst, resulting in the failure of several prominent
financial institutions, many of the remaining banks were left with mortgage-backed
securities that could not be sold. Existing accounting rules for financial instruments
required those instruments be valued at the fair value, sometimes referred to as markto-market accounting. Unfortunately, many of these assets no longer had a market,
and accountants were forced to report these assets at their "distressed" values.
The banking industry did not like this accounting treatment. Many industry lobbyists
complained that a security that was backed by identifiable cash flows still had a
value, even if it were currently unmarketable. They were concerned that reporting
these distressed values in the financial statements would lower reported profits and
further damage the already-weakened confidence in the banking sector. The banking
industry lobbied lawmakers aggressively to put pressure on the FASB to change the
rules. In the end, they succeeded, and the FASB made changes that allowed for
alternative valuation techniques. The application of these techniques would result in
higher profits than would have been reported under the old rules.
Although the banking industry was somewhat satisfied with this result, critics noted
that the new rules gave the banks more latitude to report results that were less
transparent and possibly less representative of economic reality. There is much
at stake when financial results are reported, and accountants face pressures from
parties both inside and outside the business to manipulate those results to achieve
certain goals. Accountants need a solid foundation of rules and principles to rely on
in making the judgments necessary when preparing financial statements. However,
accounting standard setting can, at times, be a political process, and the practicing
accountant needs to be aware that the profession’s thoughtful principles may not
always provide all the solutions.

Introduction
The profession and practice of accounting has seen tremendous changes since the turn
of the new millennium. A series of accounting scandals in the early 2000s, followed by
the tremendous upheaval in capital markets and the world economy that resulted from the
2008 meltdown of the financial services industry, has led many to question the purpose
and value of accounting information. In this chapter, we will examine the nature and

Chapter Organization

purpose of accounting information and the key challenges faced by those who create accounting standards. We will also examine the accounting profession’s response to those
challenges, including the conceptual framework that currently shapes the development of
accounting standards. We will also discuss the role of ethical behaviour in the accounting
profession and the issues faced by practicing accountants.

Key Differences

2.1 Definition and Information Asymmetry
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has stated that the purpose of
financial reporting is “to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is
useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions
about providing resources to the entity. Those decisions involve buying, selling or holding
equity and debt instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit”
(International Accounting Standards Board, 2012). The key elements of this definition are
that information must be useful and that it must assist in the decision-making function.
Although this primary definition identifies investors, lenders, and creditors as the user

8

Why Accounting?

groups, the IASB does acknowledge that other users may also find financial statements
useful. The IASB also acknowledges two key characteristics of the financial-reporting
environment. First, most users, such as shareholders or lenders, do not have the ability
to access information directly from the reporting entity. Thus, those users must rely on
general-purpose financial statements as well as other sources to obtain the information.
Second, management of the company has access to more information than the external
users, as they can access internal, nonpublic sources from the company’s records. These
two conditions result in information asymmetry, which is a key concept in understanding
the purpose and development of accounting standards.
Information asymmetry simply means that one individual has more information than
another individual. This concept is very easy to understand and is obviously true in all
kinds of interactions that occur in your life on a daily basis. When you enter the room
to write an exam, you know how much sleep you had the night before and what you ate
for breakfast, but your professor does not. This type of information advantage is not very
useful to you, however, as your professor is interested only in what you write on your
exam paper, not the conditions that led up to those responses. In other cases, however,
it is possible that you could gain an information advantage that could be useful to your
performance on the exam. In the broader perspective of financial accounting, we are
concerned the implications and problems that may be caused by information asymmetry.
To explore this concept further, we need to consider two different forms of information
asymmetry: adverse selection and moral hazard.
Adverse selection occurs because employees and managers of a company have more
knowledge of the company’s operations than the general public and, more specifically,
investors. Because these individuals know more about the company and its potential
future profitability, they may be tempted to take advantage of this knowledge. For example,
if a manager of a company knew that a contract had just been signed with a new customer
that was going to significantly increase revenues in the following year, the manager may
be tempted to purchase shares of the company on the open market before the contract
is announced to the public. By doing so, the manager may benefit when the news of the
contract is released and the price of the share rises. In this case, the manager has unfairly
used his or her information advantage to gain a personal benefit, which can be considered
adverse to the interests of other investors. Because investors are aware of this potential
problem, they may lose confidence in the securities market. This could result in investors
generally paying less for shares than may be warranted by the fundamental factors of
the business. The investors would do this because they wouldn’t completely trust the
information they were receiving. If this lack of confidence became serious or widespread,
it is possible that securities markets wouldn’t function at all.
The field of financial accounting clearly has a role in trying to solve the adverse selection problem. By making sufficient, high-quality information available to investors in a
timely manner, accountants can reduce the adverse effects of this form of information
asymmetry. However, it is impossible to eliminate the problem completely, as insiders
of a company will always receive the information first. The accounting profession must

2.2. Trade-Offs

9

thus work toward cost-effective and reasonable (but imperfect) solutions to convey useful
information to investors.
Moral hazard is a different type of problem caused by an information imbalance. Except
for very small businesses, most companies operate under the principle of separation of
ownership and management. Shareholders can be numerous and geographically diverse;
it is impossible for them to be directly involved in the running of the business. To solve
this problem, shareholders hire managers to act as stewards of their investment. One
feature of corporate law is the presumption that managers will always work toward the
best interests of the company. Shareholders assume this to be true, but they do not have
a very effective method of directly observing manager behaviour. Managers know this;
thus, there may be an incentive – or at least an opportunity – not to work as hard or as
effectively as the shareholders would like. If the company’s performance suffers because
of poor manager effort, the manager can always blame outside factors or other economic
conditions. In extreme cases, the manager may even be tempted to manipulate financial
reports to cover up poor performance.
To give shareholders the ability to monitor manager performance, financial accounting
must seek ways to provide financial performance measures. Many analytical techniques
use financial accounting as a basis for the calculations. However, shareholders must
have confidence not only in the accuracy of the information but also in the usefulness
of the information for evaluation of management stewardship. Again, there is no perfect
solution here, as the complexities and qualitative features of management activity can
never be perfectly captured by numbers alone. Still, financial accounting information can
help investors assess the quality of the managers they hire, which can potentially reduce
the moral hazard problem.

2.2 Trade-Offs
As suggested in the previous section, accounting can play a role in reducing both adverse
selection and moral hazard. However, because these two problems relate to two different
user needs (i.e., the need to predict future investment performance and the need to
evaluate management stewardship), it is unlikely that accounting information will always
be perfectly and simultaneously useful in alleviating these problems. For example, information about the current values of assets may help an investor better predict the future
economic prospects of the company, particularly in the short term. However, current
values may not reveal much about management stewardship, as managers have very
little control over market conditions. Similarly, the depreciated historical cost of property,
plant, and equipment assets can reveal something about management’s decision-making
processes regarding the purchase and use of these assets, but historical costs provide
very little value in estimating future returns. Accounting standard setters recognize that
any specific disclosure may not meet all users’ needs, and as such, trade-offs are

10

Why Accounting?

necessary in setting standards. Sometimes trade-offs between different user purposes
are required, and sometimes the trade-off is simply a matter of evaluating the cost of
producing the information compared with the benefit received. Because of these tradeoffs, accounting information must be viewed as an imperfect solution to the problem of
information asymmetry. Still, those who set accounting standards attempt to create the
framework for the production of information that will be useful to all readers, in particular
to the primary user groups of investors, lenders, and creditors.

2.3 How Are Standards Set?
In Canada, the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB) sets accounting standards. The
AcSB is an independent body whose members are appointed by the Accounting Standards Oversight Council (AcSOC). The AcSOC was established in 2000 by the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) to oversee the standard setting process. Currently the AcSB receives funding, staff, and other resources from the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada).
Two distinct sets of accounting standards for profit-oriented enterprises exist in Canada:
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for those entities that have public
accountability and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) for those entities
that do not have public accountability.
The CPA Canada Handbook defines a publicly accountable enterprise as follows:

An entity, other than a not-for-profit organization, that:
I. has issued, or is in the process of issuing, debt or equity instruments that
are, or will be, outstanding and traded in a public market (a domestic or
foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and
regional markets); or
II. holds assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders as one
of its primary businesses. (CPA Canada, 2016)

Entities included in the second category can include banks, credit unions, investment
dealers, insurance companies, and other businesses that hold assets for clients. For most
of the illustrative examples in this text, we will assume that publicly traded companies use
IFRS and that private companies use ASPE. Note that companies that do not have public
accountability may still elect to use IFRS if they like. They may choose to do this if they
intend to become publicly traded in the future or have some other reporting relationship
with a public company.

2.4. The Conceptual Framework

11

ASPE are formulated solely by the AcSB and are designed specifically for the needs of
Canadian private companies. IFRS, on the other hand, are created by the IASB and are
adopted by the AcSB. The AcSB is actively involved with the IASB in the development of
IFRS, and most IFRS are adopted directly into the CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting.
In some rare circumstances, however, the AcSB may determine that a particular IFRS
does not adequately meet the reporting needs of Canadian businesses and may thus
choose to “carve out” this particular section before including the standard in the CPA
Canada Handbook.
The IASB was formed for the purpose of harmonizing international accounting standards.
This concept makes sense, as the past few decades have seen increased international
trade, improvement of technologies, and other factors that have made capital more mobile.
Investors who want to make choices between companies in different countries need to
have some confidence that they will be able to compare reported financial results. The
IASB has attempted to provide this assurance, and the use of IFRS around the world
continues to grow, with partial or full convergence now in more than 130 countries.
For Canadian accountants, it is important to note that the United States still has not
converged its standards with IFRS. Canada has a significant amount of cross-border trade
with the United States, and many Canadian companies are also listed on American stock
exchanges. In the United States, accounting standards are set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), although the actual legal authority for standard setting rests
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The FASB has indicated in the
past that it wishes to work with IASB to find a way to converge its standards with the
international model. However, the FASB’s standards are quite detailed and prescriptive,
which makes convergence difficult. As well, a number of political factors have prevented
convergence from occurring. As this point, it is difficult to predict when or if the FASB will
converge its standards with the IASB.

2.4 The Conceptual Framework
According the CPA Canada Handbook, “the objective of a conceptual framework is to
facilitate the consistent and logical formulation of standards and provide a basis for the
use of judgment in resolving accounting issues” (CPA Canada, 2016). A solid, coherent
framework of principles is important not only to standard setters who need to develop
new principles in response to changes in the business environment but also to practicing
accountants who may encounter unusual or unique types of business transactions on a
daily basis.
The IASB and the FASB have been working on a joint conceptual framework for several
years, and it is this framework that is currently used in Canada for publicly accountable
enterprises. The conceptual framework used for private enterprises is very similar in

12

Why Accounting?

content, although the structure, terminology, and emphasis differ slightly. We will focus on
the IASB framework, which is located in Part 1 of the CPA Canada Handbook.

2.4.1 The Objective of Financial Reporting
The conceptual framework opens with a statement of the purpose of financial reporting,
which was discussed previously in this chapter. Recall that the key components of this
definition are that financial information must be useful for making decisions, primarily
about investment or lending of resources to a business entity. The conceptual framework
then proceeds to discuss the qualitative characteristics of useful accounting information.

2.4.2 Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Information
The conceptual framework identifies fundamental and enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful information.
The fundamental characteristics are
• relevance and
• faithful representation.
The enhancing characteristics are
• comparability,
• verifiability,
• timeliness, and
• understandability.
Fundamental Characteristics
Relevance means that information is “capable of making a difference in the decisions
made by users” (CPA Canada, 2016, QC6). The definition is further refined to state
that information is capable of influencing decisions if it has predictive value, confirmatory
value, or both. Predictive value means that the information can be used to assist in the
process of making predictions about future events, such as potential investment returns,

2.4. The Conceptual Framework

13

credit defaults, and other decisions that financial-statement users need to make. Note
that although the information may assist in these decisions, the information is not in
itself a prediction or forecast. Rather, the information is the raw material used by the
decision maker to make the prediction. Confirmatory value means that the information
provides some feedback about previous decisions that were made. Quite often, the
same information may be useful for prediction and feedback purposes, but in different
time periods. An income statement may help an investor decide to invest in a company
this year, and next year’s income statement, when released, will provide feedback as to
whether the investment decision was correct. The framework also mentions the concept
of materiality. A piece of information is considered material if its omission would affect
a user’s decision. Materiality is a concept used frequently by both internal accountants
and auditors in determining the need to make adjustments for errors identified. Clearly,
an item that is not deemed to be material is not relevant, as it would not affect a user’s
decision.
Faithful representation means that the financial information presented represents the
true economic condition or state of the item being reported. This does not mean, however,
that the representation must be 100 percent accurate. The CPA Handbook indicates that
for information to faithfully represent an economic phenomenon, it must be complete,
neutral, and free from error.
Information is complete if there is sufficient disclosure for the reader to understand the
underlying phenomenon or event. This means that many financial disclosures will require
additional explanations that go beyond a mere reporting of the quantitative values. Completeness is the motivation behind many of the note disclosures contained in financial
statements. Because financial-statement users are trying to make predictions about
future events, more detail is often needed than simply the balance sheet or incomestatement amount. For example, if an investor wanted to understand a manufacturing
company’s requirements for future replacement of property, plant, and equipment assets,
detailed information about the remaining useful lives of the assets and related depreciation periods and methods would be needed. Similarly, if a creditor wanted to assess the
possible future effect on cash flows of a lease agreement, detailed information about the
term of the lease, the required payments, and possible renewal options would be needed.
The neutrality concept suggests that the information is not biased and does not favour
one particular outcome or prediction over another. This can often be difficult to assess, as
many judgments are required in some accounting measures. There are many motivations
for managers and preparers of financial statements to bias or influence the reporting of
certain results. These motivations will be discussed later in this chapter. The professional
accountant’s role is to ensure that these biases are understood and controlled so that the
reported financial results are not misleading to readers.
As noted previously, information that is free from errors is not a guarantee of certainty or
100 percent accuracy. Rather, this criterion suggests that the economic phenomenon is
accurately described and the process at arriving at the reported amount has properly

14

Why Accounting?

applied. There is still the possibility that a reported amount could be incorrect. For
example, at the end of the fiscal year, many companies will make an allowance for doubtful
accounts to reflect the possibility that some accounts receivable will not be collected.
At the balance sheet date, there is no way to be 100 percent certain that the reported
allowance is correct. Only the passage of time will reveal the truth about this estimate.
However, we can still say that the allowance is free from error if we can determine that
a logical and consistent process has been applied to determine the amount and that this
process is adequately described in the financial statements. This way, readers are able
to make their own assessments of the risks involved in collecting these future cash flows.
It should be noted that the presence of both of the fundamental characteristics is required
for information to be useful. An error-free representation of an irrelevant phenomenon is
not much use to financial-statement readers. Similarly, if a relevant measure cannot be
described with any degree of accuracy, then users will not find this information very useful
for predicting future cash flows.
Enhancing Characteristics
The conceptual framework describes four additional qualitative characteristics that should
enhance the usefulness of information that is already determined to be relevant and
faithfully represented. These characteristics are comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and
understandability.
Comparability is the quality that allows readers to compare either results from one entity
with another entity or results from the same entity from one year with another year. This
quality is important because readers such as investors are interested in making decisions
whether to purchase one company’s shares over another’s or to simply divest a share
already held. One key component of the comparability quality is consistency. Consistency
refers to the use of the same method to account for the same items, either within the same
entity from one period to the next or across different entities for the same accounting
period. Consistency in application of accounting principles can lead to comparability,
but comparability is a broader concept than consistency. Also, comparability must not
be confused with uniformity. Items that are fundamentally different in nature should be
accounted for differently.
The verifiability quality suggests that two or more independent and knowledgeable observers could come to the same conclusion about the reported amount of a particular
financial-statement item. This does not mean that the observers have to be in complete
agreement with each other. In the case of an estimated amount on the financial statements, such as an allowance for doubtful accounts, it is possible that two auditors may
agree that the amount should fall within a certain range, but each may have different
opinion of which end of the range is more probable. If they agree on the range, however,
we can still say the amount is verifiable. Verification may be performed by either directly
observing the item, such as examining a purchase invoice issued by a vendor, or indirectly
verifying the inputs and calculations of a model to determine the output, such as reviewing

the assumptions and recalculating the amount of an allowance for doubtful accounts by
using data from an aged trial balance of accounts receivable.
Timeliness is one of the simplest but most important concepts in accounting. Generally,
information needs to be current to be useful. Investors and other users need to know the
economic condition of the business at the present moment, not at some previous period.
However, past information can still be useful for tracking trends and may be especially
useful for evaluating management stewardship.
Understandability is the one characteristic that the accounting profession has often been
accused of disregarding. It is generally assumed that readers of financial statements
should have a reasonable understanding of business issues and basic accounting terminology. However, many business transactions are inherently complex, and the accountant
faces a challenge in crafting the disclosures in such a way that they completely and
concisely describe the economic nature of the item while still being comprehensible.
Financial disclosures should be reviewed by nonspecialist, knowledgeable readers to
ensure the accountant has achieved the quality of understandability.
As mentioned previously, accountants are often faced with trade-offs in preparing financial
disclosures. This is especially true when considering the application of the various qualitative characteristics. Sometimes, the need for timeliness may result less-than-optimal
verifiability, as verification of some items may require the passage of time. As a result, the
accountant is forced to make estimations in order to ensure the information is available
within a reasonable time. As well, all information has a cost, and companies will carefully
consider the cost of producing the information compared with the benefits that can be obtained from the information, such as improving relevance or faithful representation. These
challenges point to the conclusion that accounting is an imperfect measurement system
that requires judgment in both the preparation and interpretation of the information.

2.4.3 Elements of Financial Statements
The CPA Canada Handbook includes a section describing a number of essential financialstatement elements. This section is not intended to be an exhaustive list of each item
that could appear on the financial statements. Rather, it describes broad categories
of financial-statement elements and defines them using key concepts that identify the
essential elements of each category. These broadly based definitions will require the
accountant to use judgment in the determination of the nature and the specific treatment
and disclosure of business transactions. However, the accountant’s judgment can also
help ensure that financial statements properly reflect the underlying economic nature of
the transaction, not just the legal form that may have been designed to circumvent more
specific rules.
An Underlying Assumption

16

Why Accounting?

Before commencing a detailed examination of elements of financial statements, it is important to understand the key assumption underlying the reporting process. It is normally
assumed that companies are operating as a going concern. This means that the company
is expected to continue operating into the foreseeable future and that there will be no
need to liquidate significant portions of the business or otherwise materially scale back
operations. This assumption is important, because a company that is not a going concern
would likely need to apply a different method of accounting in order not to be misleading.
If a company needed to liquidate equipment at a substantial discount due to bankruptcy
or other financial distress, it would not be appropriate to carry those assets at depreciated
cost. In situations of financial distress, the accountant needs to carefully consider the
going-concern assumption in determining the correct accounting treatment.
Assets
An asset is the first financial-statement element that needs to be considered. In the
simplest sense, an asset is something that a business owns. The CPA Canada Handbook
defines an asset as “a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from
which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity” (CPA Canada, 2016,
4.4a). The key point in this definition is that economic benefits are expected to be received
at some point in the future as a result of holding the resource. The most obvious benefit is
the future inflow of cash. This can be seen very clearly with an item such as inventory held
by a retail store, as the store expects to sell the items in a short period of time to generate
cash. However, an asset could also be a piece of equipment installed in a factory that
reduces the consumption of electricity by production processes. Although this equipment
will not directly generate a future cash inflow, it does reduce a future cash outflow. This is
also considered an economic benefit.
Many assets have a tangible, or physical, form. However, some assets, such as accounts
receivable or a patent, have no physical form. In the case of an account receivable from
a customer, the future benefit results from the legal right the company holds to enforce
payment. For a patent, the future benefit results from the company’s ability to sell its
product while maintaining some protection from competitors. Cash in a bank account
does not have physical form, but it can be used as a medium of exchange.
It should also be noted that, although we can generally think of assets as something we
own, the actual legal title to the resource does not necessarily need to belong to the
company for it to be considered an asset. A contract, such as a long-term lease that
conveys benefits to the leasing party over a significant portion of the asset’s useful life
may be considered an asset in certain circumstances.
Liabilities
A liability is defined as “a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying
economic benefits” (CPA Canada, 2016, 4.4b). This definition can be visualized through

OBLIGATION

Future

SETTLEMENT

When we prepare a balance sheet, it represents the present moment, so the obligation
gets reported as a liability. This obligation is often a legal obligation, as in the case when
goods are purchased on account, resulting in an accounts payable entry, or when money
is borrowed from a bank, resulting in a loan payable. As well, this legal obligation can exist
even in the absence of a formal contract. A company still has to report wages payable
for any work performed by an employee but not yet paid, even if that work was performed
under the terms of an informal, casual labour agreement.
Liabilities can also result from common business practice or custom, even if there is no
legally enforceable amount. If a retailer of mobile telephones agrees to replace one
broken screen per customer, then the expected cost of these replacements should be
reported as a liability, even if the damage resulted from the customer’s neglect and there
is no legal obligation to pay. As well, companies may record liabilities based on equitable
principles. If a company significantly reduces its workforce, it may feel a moral obligation
to provide career transition counselling to its laid-off employees, even though there is no
legal obligation to do so.
The settlement of the liability usually involves the future transfer of cash, but it can also be
settled by transferring other assets. As well, liabilities are sometimes settled through the
provision of services in the future. A health club that requires its members to pay for one
year’s fees in advance has an obligation to make the facilities available to its members for
that time. Less common ways to settle liabilities include replacing the liability with a new
liability and converting the liability into equity of the business. It should be noted that the
determination of the value of the liability to be recorded sometimes requires significant
judgment. An example of this would be the obligation under a pension plan to make
future payments to retirees. We will discuss this estimation problem in more detail in later
chapters dealing with liabilities.
Equity
Equity is the owners’ residual interest in the business, representing the remaining amount
of assets available after all liabilities have been settled. Although equity can be thought
of as a balancing figure, it is usually subdivided into various categories when presented
on the balance sheet. Many of these classifications are related to legal requirements

18

Why Accounting?

regarding the ownership interest. The usual categories of equity include share capital,
which can include common and preferred shares, retained earnings, and accumulated
other comprehensive income (IFRS only). However, other types of equity can arise on
certain types of transaction, such as contributed surplus, appropriated retained earnings,
and other reserves that may be allowed under local law. The purpose of all these subcategories of equity is to give readers enough information to understand how and when the
owners may be able to receive a distribution of their interests. For example, restrictions
on retained earnings or levels of preferences on shares issued may constrain the future
payment of dividends to common shareholders. A potential investor would want to know
this before investing in the company.
It should also be noted that the company’s reported equity does not represent its value,
either in a real sense or in the market. The prices that shares trade at in the stock market
represent the cumulative decisions of investors, based on all information that is available.
Although financial statements form part of this total pool of information, there are so many
other factors used by investors to value a company that it is unlikely that the market value
of a company would equal the reported amount of equity on the balance sheet.
Income
Income is defined as “increases in economic benefits during the accounting period in
the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in
increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from equity participants”
(CPA Canada, 2016, 4.25a). Notice that the definition is based on presence of changes
in assets or liabilities, rather than on the concept of something being earned. This
represents the balance sheet approach used in the conceptual framework, which considers any measure of performance, such as profit, to simply be a representation of the
change in balance sheet amounts. This perspective is quite different from some historical
views adopted previously in various jurisdictions, which viewed the primary purpose of
accounting to be the measurement of profit (an income-statement approach).
Income can include both revenues and gains. Revenues arise in the course of the
normal activities of the business; gains arise from either the disposal of noncurrent assets
(realized gains) or the revaluation of noncurrent assets (unrealized gains). Unrealized
gains on certain types of assets are usually included in other comprehensive income, a
concept that will be discussed in later chapters.
Expenses
Expenses are defined as “decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period
in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in
decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants” (CPA
Canada, 2016, 4.25b). Note that this definition is really just the inverse of the definition of
income. Similarly, expenses can include those that are incurred in the regular operation
of the business and those that result from losses. Again, losses can be either realized or

2.4. The Conceptual Framework

19

unrealized, and the definition is the same it was for gains.

2.4.4 Recognition
Items are recognized in financial statements when the following criteria are present:

• The item meets the definition of an element.
• It is probable that any future economic benefit associated with the item will flow to
or from the entity.
• The item has a cost or value that can be measured with reliability (CPA Canada,
2016, 4.38).

Recognition means the item is included directly in one of the financial statements and
not simply disclosed in the notes. However, if an item does not meet the criteria for
recognition, it may still be necessary to disclose details in the notes to the financial
statements. A pending lawsuit judgment at the reporting date may not meet the criterion of
reliable measurement, but the possible future impact of the event could still be of interest
to readers.
Determining the probability of future economic benefits often requires judgment, as future
events are not predictable with certainty. The accountant will need to consider not only
the element itself but also the characteristics of the entity’s environment and the quality of
the evidence available at the time. Although the conceptual framework does not formally
define the term probable, accountants usually interpret this to mean “more likely than
not.” As well, the reliability of measurement will also require the exercise of judgment, as
many accounting elements need to be estimated to be valued. These estimations can be
quite accurate when there are patterns of historical behaviour or other credible evidence
that supports the estimates. However, if the accountant does not have sufficient reliable
evidence to meet the measurement criterion, the element cannot be recognized.

2.4.5 Measurement Base
The conceptual framework also notes that once recognition is affirmed, the appropriate
measurement base needs to be considered. The following four measurement bases are
identified in the conceptual framework:

• Historical cost

20

Why Accounting?

• Current cost
• Realizable (settlement) value
• Present value

Historical cost is perhaps the most well-entrenched concept in accounting. This simply
means that items are recorded at the actual amount of cash paid or received at the time
of the original transaction. This concept has persisted in accounting thought for so long
because of its relative reliability and verifiability. However, the concept is often criticized
because historical cost information tends to lose relevance as time passes. This can be
particularly true for long-lived assets, such as real estate.
The current cost concept results in assets being reported at the amount that would
currently need to be paid to acquire a similar asset, while liabilities are reported at the
current, undiscounted amount of cash needed to settle the liability. This measurement
base tries to achieve greater relevance by using current information, but it may not always
be possible to represent this information faithfully when active markets for the item do not
exist. It may be very difficult to find the current cost of a unique or specialized asset that
was purpose built for a company.
Realizable (settlement) value attempts to value assets at the amount that could currently
be realized by selling the asset in an orderly fashion. Liabilities are measured at the undiscounted amount of cash expected to be paid to settle the liabilities in the normal course
of business. Again, these measurements are felt to be more relevant than historical cost
information, as the information is current. However, this concept suffers from the same
reliability problems as current cost, as exit prices may not always be available for certain
types of assets. As well, some critics have pointed out that exit prices are not particularly
relevant if the company does not have any actual plans to dispose of the assets in the
near future.
Present value accounting attempts to get around this criticism by valuing assets at the
present value of future net-cash inflows related to those assets and liabilities at the
present value of future net-cash outflows. Thus, this is a more realistic valuation of
the asset’s value in use to the corporation. Quite often, this type of technique is used
for internal decision-making purposes, so it is thought that this information will also be
relevant to external readers. However, present-value calculations require a significant
amount of estimation regarding the quantum, timing, and probability of future cash flows
as well as the appropriate discount rate to use.
All of the measurement bases identified have both strengths and weaknesses in terms
of their overall decision usefulness for readers. Thus, there are always trade-offs and
compromises evident when accounting standards are set. It is not surprising, then, to
see that current accounting standards are a hybrid, or conglomeration, of these different

2.4. The Conceptual Framework

21

bases. Historical cost is still the most common base used, but many accounting standards
for specific items will allow or require other bases as well.
It should be noted that the Conceptual Framework’s discussion of measurement bases
should be read in conjunction with IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement. While the Conceptual Framework provides a broad overview of possible measurement bases, IFRS 13
provides more specific guidance on how to determine fair value. Fair value is a concept
that is applied to a number of different accounting transactions under IFRS. Fair value is
defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” (CPA
Canada, 2016, IFRS 13.9). Depending on the nature of the item and the availability of
market information, the fair value may be determined easily or may require some degree
of estimation and judgment. In some cases, it may not be possible to determine the fair
value. IFRS 13 suggests that valuation techniques should maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard further applies a
hierarchy to those inputs to assist the accountant in assessing the quality of the data
used for valuation. Level 1 of the hierarchy represents unadjusted, quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are those that are directly or
indirectly observable but do not meet the definition of Level 1. This could include quoted
prices from inactive markets or quoted prices for similar (but not identical) assets. Level 3
inputs are those that are unobservable. In this case, valuation techniques that require the
use of assumptions and calculations of future cash flows may be required. IFRS 13 recommends that Level 1 inputs should always be used where possible. Unfortunately, Level
1 inputs are often unavailable for many assets. The application of fair-value accounting
as described in IFRS 13 will be discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters.

2.4.6 Capital Maintenance
The last section of the conceptual framework deals with the concept of capital maintenance. This is a broader economic concept that attempts to define the level of capital or
operating capability that investors would want to maintain in a business. This is important
for investors because they ultimately want to earn a return on their invested capital in order
to achieve growth in their overall wealth. However, measuring this growth will depend on
how capital is defined.
The conceptual framework identifies two broad approaches to this question. The measurement of the owners’ wealth can be defined in terms of financial capital or in terms
of physical capital.
Financial capital maintenance is measured simply by the changes in equity reported on
the company’s balance sheet. These changes can be measured either in terms of money
invested or in terms of purchasing power. The monetary interpretation is consistent with
the approach used in historical cost accounting, where wealth is measured in nominal

22

Why Accounting?

units (dollars, euros, etc.). This is a simple and reasonable approach in the short term,
but over longer periods, monetary values are less relevant due to inflation. A dollar in
1950 could purchase much more than it could in 2014, so comparisons of capital over
longer periods become meaningless. One way to get around this problem is to apply a
constant purchasing power model to capital maintenance. This attempts to apply a broadbased index, such as the Consumer Price Index, to equity in order to adjust for the effects
of inflation. This should make financial results more comparable over time. However, it is
very difficult to conclude that a broad-based index is representative of the actual level of
inflation experienced by the company, as the company would be selling and purchasing
goods that are different from those included in the index.
The concept of physical capital maintenance attempts to get around this problem by
measuring productive capacity. If a company can maintain the same level of outputs year
after year, then it can be said that capital is maintained, even if the nominal monetary
amounts change. This approach essentially represents the rationale behind the current
cost-measurement base. The difficulty in using this approach is that current cost information about each specific asset in the business would be prohibitively expensive to obtain.
If, instead, the company tried to apply a general index of prices for its specific industry,
it is unlikely that this index would accurately match the specific asset composition of the
company.
The conceptual framework concludes that the framework will not prescribe or require a
specific model because there are so many trade-offs required in determining the appropriate capital maintenance model. Rather, the framework suggests that needs of financialstatement users should be considered in determining the appropriate model.

2.5 Challenges in Financial Reporting
As noted in the introduction to this chapter, confidence in financial markets and the
accounting profession were shaken in the early 2000s. A series of accounting scandals, perhaps most notably Enron Corporation’s, resulted in questioning the role of the
information providers and the need for further regulation. One response, indeed, to these
problems was the introduction of further regulation. In the United States, the SarbanesOxley Act (SOX) was introduced in 2002 to restore the confidence in financial markets
that had been so badly shaken after the accounting scandals. This legislation tightened
up auditor independence rules, introduced new levels of oversight, created additional
penalties for company executives engaged in fraudulent reporting, and improved other
disclosure requirements. There have been improvements observed in disclosure practices since the introduction of SOX, but these improvements have come with a cost. Some
estimates have put the cost of SOX compliance at $6 billion per year. This is significant,
but in assessing this cost, it is also important to consider the benefits. The major benefit
that results from legislation like SOX is the potential reduction of market failures. When

2.5. Challenges in Financial Reporting

23

scandals such as the one at Enron occur, the loss is borne not only by shareholders but
also by employees, other companies, and the general public, who will feel the effect of any
recession or economic slowing that results from reduced confidence in the markets. But
although the nature of the benefit is clear, the quantification of it is not. It is very difficult
to measure the reduction of market failures that has occurred due to legislation, because
if the legislation worked, there would be nothing to measure.
It would be unrealistic to suggest that regulation could completely eliminate any problem
as complex as information asymmetry. Although SOX did appear to be effective in improving financial practices and disclosures, it did not prevent the 2008 financial crisis and
subsequent market meltdown. This is likely because the causes of this crisis were not
primarily matters of accounting and reporting – rather, they were related to the regulation
and practices of the investment-banking industry. So the argument can be made that
further regulations are required. But the regulator faces the challenge to determine the
appropriate amount of regulation. Too little regulation can allow fraudulent practices to
continue, but too much can stifle business initiative and growth.
One response by the accounting profession to the need for the further regulation has been
the development of IFRS. These standards were introduced at the time that financial
crises were shaking the financial world in the early 2000s. IFRS are viewed as being
more principles based relative to other standards, such as the United States’ Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which has historically been more rules based.
Principles-based standards present a series of basic concepts that can be used by professional accountants to make decisions about the appropriate accounting treatment
of individual transactions. These concepts are often intentionally broad and often do
not provide specific, detailed guidance to the accountant. Rules-based standards, on
the other hand, are more prescriptive and detailed. These standards attempt to create
a rule for any situation that may be encountered by the accountant. Accordingly, the
body of knowledge is much larger, with much more specific detail regarding accounting
treatments.
Principles-based standards are usually considered to have the advantage of being more
flexible, as they allow for more interpretation and judgment by the accountant. This can
be particularly useful when unusual or unique business transactions are presented to the
accountant. However, this flexibility is one of the weaknesses of this approach. Some
fear that giving too much freedom to the accountant to interpret the accounting standards
may result in financial statements that are less comparable to those of other entities or
that could be subject to increased earnings management or other manipulations.
Because rules-based systems have far greater detailed guidance, some have argued
that this is better for the accountant, as the accountant can defend the treatment of a
particular transaction by simply pointing to compliance with the rule. As well, it is thought
that rules-based systems can also lead to greater comparability, as much of the format
and content of disclosure are tightly prescribed. Unfortunately, overly detailed rules can
still allow for a different type of misrepresentation called financial engineering. When an

24

Why Accounting?

accounting treatment relies on specific and detailed rules, creative managers can simply
invent a new type of transaction that works around the existing rules. They will argue
that the rule does not specifically prohibit them from doing what they are doing, but the
engineered transaction may, in fact, be violating the spirit of the rule. Interpretations that
focus more on the form of the transaction than on the substance can lead to inappropriate
and ultimately misleading accounting. As a practical matter, all systems of accounting
regulation contain both broadly based principles and detailed rules. The challenge for
accounting standard setters is to find the right balance of rules and principles.
It should be apparent that many of the problems faced by the accounting profession stem
from the questionable application of ethical principles. As noted before, the broad purpose
of accounting information is to reduce information asymmetry. Information asymmetry can
never be eliminated, but if accountants can communicate sufficient, useful information,
then the asymmetry can be mitigated. Although it is a normal business practice to try to
take advantage of an information imbalance, if this is done in a misleading or deceitful way
that unfairly disadvantages certain parties, confidence in capital markets will be damaged.
The accountant, in trying to provide as much information as possible to clients, will face
pressure from those vested interests that stand to gain from the information imbalance.
The accountant may be asked to withhold or distort the information to achieve certain
results. Often, these pressures are subtle and not presented as a clear-cut violation
of accounting standards. Business transactions can be complex, and the application of
accounting standards to those transactions can involve significant judgment, estimation,
and uncertainty. The answer to an accounting question may not be clear, and certain
interested parties may view this state as an opportunity to try to influence the accountant.
The management of a company often has a particular interest in trying to influence
financial reports. Managers are given the task by the shareholders of managing the
business in the most efficient and profitable way possible. Managers face great pressures
in the task and will at times look at the financial reporting as one tool to be used to
deal with these pressures. Managers may be motivated to influence or bias the reported
financial results for a number of reasons, including the following:

• The presence of performance-based compensation: Managers may be rewarded in
bonuses or stock options that are directly or indirectly influenced by financial results.
The manager clearly has an incentive to make the results look positive.
• Evaluation of management stewardship: Even if the manager is not directly compensated based on results, the manager’s value to the company will still be evaluated
relative to the business’s performance.
• Meeting market expectations: Financial markets expect results and can be very
punitive when expected results are not achieved. In order to meet the market’s
expectations with respect to performance, the manager may feel pressure to “work
the numbers.”

2.5. Challenges in Financial Reporting

25

• Conditions of contracts: Some contracts, such as a loan agreement with a bank,
may stipulate that certain financial ratios be maintained. If the ratios are not maintained, then some punitive consequence will likely be applied, such as a penalty or
additional interest charges. As the financial ratio is based on reported results, the
manager has an incentive to ensure the results keep the company onside.
• Political pressures: Sometimes a company may face pressures that are not directly
related to the interests of the investors or lenders. A large, profitable company
that enjoys a certain level of oligopolistic power may face additional public scrutiny
if profits are too high. Public-interest groups may feel that the company is taking
advantage of its position of power, and they may demand political action, such as
increased taxes or other sanctions against the company. In order to avoid this type of
political heat, the managers may have an incentive to deliberately reduce or smooth
income.

In these examples, it should be apparent that the accountant could play a key role in
the achievement of management’s objectives. The accountant must therefore always be
aware of these motivations and apply sound judgment and ethical principles. But the
application of ethics is not simply a matter of consulting an ethics handbook. An ethical
sense is a personal characteristic that is inherent in each individual. It is very difficult to
teach, as our personal ethics are formed long before we choose to become professional
accountants. Ethical awareness and practice, however, is something for which the
accounting profession has developed a significant framework.
All professional bodies contain codes of conduct for their members. In these codes,
basic principles of ethical behaviour and discussions of how to deal with ethical conflicts
are included. Some of the common principles that are included in these codes include
the following:

• Integrity : The accountant should always act in an honest fashion and not be associated with any information that is false or misleading.
• Objectivity : The accountant should always be unbiased when applying judgment.
• Professional competence: The accountant should always maintain a level of professional knowledge that is current and sufficient for performing professional duties
and should not engage in any work that is outside the scope of that accountant’s
knowledge.
• Confidentiality : The accountant must not share privileged client information with
other parties and must not use that information for his or her own personal gain.
• Professional behaviour : The accountant should not engage in any activity that
discredits the profession.

26

Why Accounting?

Dealing with ethical conflicts and external pressures from stakeholders can be difficult
at times, and accountants are often advised to seek advice from other professionals or
their own professional association when the need arises. Accountants play a key role in
the operation of capital markets and are essential to the financing of a business. The
external stakeholders of the business expect ethical and professional conduct from the
accountants, and it is important the profession continues to earn and maintain this trust.
Another area which provides both challenges and opportunities to professional accountants is the increasing use of information technology to perform accounting and reporting
functions. Technology has allowed for the automation of routine bookkeeping tasks, as
well as the development more advanced functions such as data mining and strategic analysis. The increased use of cloud computing and mobile devices has provided platforms
for instant access to information, which could enhance the qualitative characteristic of
timeliness. Sophisticated big data applications could improve the relevance of accounting
information by targeting the specific needs of the user. Technologies such as eXtensible
Business Reporting Language (XBRL) have been designed to improve the comparability
of information by providing a standardized platform for financial statement delivery. Computer assisted audit tools and techniques allow auditors to more precisely identify key
areas of audit risk and to analyze larger sample sizes, which could lead to improvements
in the reliability of information.
Although technology provides professional accountants with opportunities to improve the
value of the information provided, it also poses challenges. XBRL has experienced
problems with data-tagging errors, which has reduced its effectiveness. Cloud computing
and mobile devices have increased concerns about data security and economic disruption. Data mining strategies have led to ethical questions about the privacy of personal
information. Real-time reporting of financial results faces concerns about data reliability,
and more significantly, the alteration of manager behaviour (i.e., earnings management).
Professional accountants need to be aware of these challenges as they adapt to rapidly
changing technologies that have the potential to both benefit and damage the reputation
of the profession.

2.6 Conclusion
The accounting profession has seen tremendous transformation over the last forty years,
brought about by changes in technology, the sophistication of capital markets, the business environment, and business practices. The profession has responded well to many
of these changes, but it needs to continue to seek ways to maintain and improve its own
relevance. At no time in history has so much information been so easily available to
so many people. But how can people be assured that the information is both true and
relevant? The accounting profession – if it is forward looking and responsive – has the
ability to provide this assurance to information users, which will enhance the perceived

2.7. IFRS/ASPE Key Differences

27

value of accountants. There are many challenges to be faced by the profession, and
some of these challenges will require solid research and reasoning and delicate political
and negotiation skills. Because accounting is not a natural science, there are no “right”
or “wrong” answers, but as long as the profession can come up with the “best” answers, it
will continue to demonstrate its value.

2.7 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
Part II of the CPA Canada Handbook does not specifically refer to a conceptual framework. However, Section 1000–Financial Statement Concepts contains many of the same
principles as identified in the IASB Conceptual Framework. Some of the key differences
are identified below:
IFRS
Two fundamental, qualitative characteristics are relevance and faithful representation. Comparability and understandability are considered enhancing qualitative
characteristics.
Timeliness is considered an enhancing
qualitative characteristic.
Verifiability is considered an enhancing
qualitative characteristic.
Faithful representation includes completeness, neutrality, and freedom from error.
Gains are included in the element “income,” and losses are included in the
element “expenses.”
Three types of capital maintenance concepts are identified, but no prescribed or
preferred approach is indicated.

ASPE
Four principal qualitative characteristics
are relevance, reliability, comparability,
and understandability.

Timeliness is included as a sub-element of
relevance.
Verifiability is a sub-element of reliability.
Reliability includes representational faithfulness, verifiability, neutrality, and conservatism.
Gains and losses are identified as separate elements of financial statements.
Only a monetary measure of capital maintenance should be used, with no adjustment for changes in purchasing power.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Identify the purpose of financial reporting.
The purpose of financial reporting is to provide information that is useful for making decisions about providing resources to the business. The primary user groups are identified
as present and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors, although other users will
also find financial information useful for their purposes.

LO 2: Describe the problem of information asymmetry, and discuss
how this problem can affect the production of financial information.
Information asymmetry simply means there is an imbalance of information between two
parties in a business transaction. This imbalance can create problems in two forms:
adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection means that one party may try to
gain a benefit over the other party by exploiting the information advantage. An example
of this behaviour is insider trading. If insider trading is perceived by the market as
being a pervasive problem, investors may lose confidence in the market, and security
prices will drop. The accounting profession can alleviate this problem by increasing the
amount of relevant and reliable information disclosed to the market, thus reducing the
information advantage of insiders. Moral hazard occurs when managers shirk their duties
because they know their efforts cannot be directly observed. In order to cover up shirking,
managers may bias the presentation of financial results. The accounting profession can
help alleviate this problem by ensuring financial-reporting standards create disclosures
that are useful in evaluating management performance and are not easily manipulated by
management.

LO 3: Describe how accounting standards are set in Canada, and
identify the key entities that are responsible for setting standards.
Currently, accounting standards are set by the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). This
board applies two sets of standards: International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprise (ASPE). IFRS are required for all publicly
accountable entities, while private entities have the choice to use ASPE or IFRS. IFRS are
developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and then adopted by
the AcSB. However, the AcSB can remove or alter certain sections of IFRS if it is believed
that the accounting treatment does not reflect Canadian practice.

LO 4: Discuss the purpose of the conceptual framework, and
identify the key components of the framework.
The conceptual framework provides a solid, theoretical foundation for standard setters
when they have to develop new standards to respond to changes in the business environment. It also gives practicing accountants a basis and reference point to use when
encountering new or unique business transactions. The key components of the framework
describe the purpose of financial reporting, identify the qualitative characteristics of good
accounting information and the elements of financial statements, and discuss the criteria
for recognizing an item in financial statements, different possible measurement bases,
and the framework’s approach to capital maintenance.

LO 5: Describe the qualitative characteristics of accounting
information.
The fundamental characteristics of accounting information are relevance (which is composed of both predictive and confirmatory characteristics) and faithful representation (which
is composed of freedom from error, neutrality, and completeness). Relevance will also be
affected by the concepts of materiality and the nature of the item. Enhancing qualitative
characteristics are understandability, comparability, verifiability, and timeliness. Trying to
meet the requirements of all the characteristics can sometimes result in trade-offs, and
this must always be evaluated in the context of costs compared with potential benefits.

LO 6: Identify the elements of financial statements.
The elements of financial statements are assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.
The definition of each element contains references to the relationships between events
and their time of occurrence, and each definition broadly describes the nature of the
element. An underlying assumption in the preparation of financial statements is that the
entity will continue as a going concern.

LO 7: Discuss the criteria required for recognizing an element in
financial statements.
An element will be recognized in financial statements when it meets the definition of that
element and can be measured reliably, and when it is probable that the future economic
benefits attached to the element will flow to or from the entity.

Why Accounting?

LO 8: Identify different measurement bases that could be used, and
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each base.
The conceptual framework identifies four possible measurement bases: historical cost,
current cost, realizable value, and present value. Historical cost forms the basis of much of
current accounting practice, but other bases are used in circumstances where it is deemed
appropriate. Each measurement base has certain advantages and disadvantages, and
the choice of measurement base will often result in a trade-off in decision usefulness.

LO 9: Identify the alternative models of capital maintenance that
could be applied.
The conceptual framework identifies three possible capital-maintenance models: monetary interpretation, constant purchasing power, and physical capital maintenance. Each
model has certain advantages and disadvantages. Current accounting practice is built
around the concept of monetary capital maintenance, but the conceptual framework does
not identify one model as being preferred over the others.

LO 10: Discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of
rules-based and principles-based accounting systems.
Rules-based systems are seen as providing more detailed guidance to accountants,
which could help accountants defend their work if challenged. As well, rules-based
systems are thought to provide better comparability, as more consistent presentations
will result. However, rules-based systems can also result in financial engineering, where
transactions are designed specifically to circumvent the rules. Principles-based systems
are seen as more flexible and more adaptive to new or unique circumstances. As well,
principles-based systems can result in presentations that better reflect local or industry
practices. Principles-based systems are criticized for being too flexible and allowing for
too much judgment by the accountant. This could create the potential for management
influence on the accountant’s work.

LO 11: Discuss the possible motivations for management bias of
financial information.
Management may be tempted to bias or otherwise influence the presentation of financial
information because of compensation contracts that are based on financial results. As

Chapter Summary

31

well, the manager will be concerned about meeting investor or analyst targets, meeting the
conditions of loan covenants or other external agreements, achieving certain political or
strategic objectives, and demonstrating sound stewardship over the company’s assets. All
of these motivations provide a temptation to the manager to influence the results reported
in the financial statements.

LO 12: Discuss the need for ethical behaviour by accountants, and
identify the key elements of the codes of conduct of the accounting
profession.
As accountants control the preparation and presentation of financial information, they
play a key role in determining the integrity of the information. Accountants will face
pressures from management and other parties who may have an interest in the content
and form of financial disclosures. Thus, accountants, need to practice their craft with an
ethical mindset, but they must also have training in how to deal with ethical issues. All
accounting bodies have codes of professional conduct that provide guidance to suggest
that accountants always act with integrity, objectivity, and competence. As well, these
codes usually specify that accountants should always maintain confidentiality and act in
a professional manner. Accountants will often have to apply significant good judgment
when dealing with ethical conflicts.

LO 13: Identify the effects on the accounting profession of changes
in information technology.
Information technology has the potential to improve the relevance, reliability, timeliness,
and comparability of information presented. It can allow accountants and auditors to provide more useful information and to more accurately identify risks. However, accountants
also need to be aware that these technologies need to be managed carefully to minimize
problems that could negatively affect the quality of information provided.

in our production cycle, but no work has yet been done on their special orders. We
will just net these prepayments against the Accounts Receivable balance and report
a single amount on the balance sheet.
d. This year we hired a director of research and development. He has not yet produced
any viable products or processes, but he was a top performer at his previous company. We have capitalized the cost of his salary and benefits, as we are confident
he will soon be producing a breakthrough product for us.
e. Our bank has put us on warning that our current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio are

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

Material Weaknesses Found in Financial Reporting Oversight
In 2014, Penn West Petroleum Ltd., a Calgary-based oil company, was tasked with
restating more than two years of financial statements in response to an internal
investigation that uncovered material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial
reporting. The impact of the restatement was a reduction in cash flow by $145 million
and an increase in its operating costs by $367 million–no small sums, to be sure!
The investigation was undertaken after the discovery of misclassifications in its
accounting records regarding its capital spending, operating costs, and royalty
payments. The investigation found that operating expenses were recorded to
property, plant, and equipment, and significant amounts of operational expenses were
reclassified to royalties’ assets. The company claimed that these errors originated
with some former employees who were no longer with the company. When news of
the scandal reached investors’ ears, fears escalated, resulting in large numbers of
shares being sold off in the stock market. In the aftermath, investors launched $400
million in class-action lawsuits in Canada and the U.S., alleging that the company and
some of its former top executives were negligent in not ensuring that adequate internal
controls regarding financial reporting were in place.
It is unknown whether the misclassifications were due to management bias, intended
to deceive, or if they were due to human error and poor judgment. Either way, the
financials prior to restatement were making the company look better than it was.
Penn West implemented new internal controls to ensure that this never happens
again. A key component of the change relates to its journal entries, to ensure any
transactions that are to be capitalized (versus being expensed) are done so only after
passing a strict oversight process.

Introduction
Financial reports are the final product of a company’s accounting processes. These
reports, combined with thoughtful analysis, are intended to “tell the story” about the
company’s operations, its financial performance for the reporting period, and its current
financial state (resources and obligations) including its cash position for that period. Is it
good news or bad news for management, investors, and creditors who are the company’s
stakeholders? Did the company meet its financial goals and objectives for the fiscal year?
The answers depend not only on the outcome of the actual operations reported in the
financial statements, but also on their accuracy and reliability, as the opening story about
Penn West explained. As discussed in Chapter 2, financial statements consist of a set
of core reports that identify the company’s resources (assets), claims to those resources
(liabilities and investor’s equity), and information about the changes in these resources
and claims (performance). A key activity after the financial statements are prepared is
to accurately analyze and evaluate the company’s performance and determine if it met
its objectives for the reporting period. This chapter will discuss financial statements that
report net income, comprehensive income, and changes in equity and their ability to tell
the story about the company’s performance for the reporting period.

3.1 Financial Reporting: Overview
The accounting system is a data repository that tracks all the economic events that have
occurred during an accounting cycle (period) and reports them in some meaningful way
to the company stakeholders. For example, the statement of income is a report required
by both IFRS and ASPE that measures the return on capital (assets) – it is the “how
well did we do” statement. This statement shows how the company performed during
its operations for a specific period of time (typically annually, monthly, or quarterly). Key
elements of the income statement include various revenue, expenses, gains, and losses
for continuing and discontinued operations. Combined, these numbers represent the
company’s net income or loss (profit or loss) for the reporting period. Comprehensive
income (an IFRS-only requirement) begins with net income and reports certain gains and

40

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

losses not reported in net income such as those arising from fair value re-measurements
for certain investments. The statement of changes in equity identifies details about the
changes in equity due to transactions affecting shareholders as owners and investors of
the company.
The IFRS and ASPE accounting standards describe which financial data is to be specifically identified and reported, out of the many thousands of transactions making up the
accounting records. To comply with these standards, separate reporting of certain information either within the body of the financial statements or within the notes to the financial
statements is required. That said, there is some flexibility regarding the information to be
reported. For example, the terminology and the style used to present the data within the
financial statements are often left to management’s discretion.
This chapter will discuss preparation of these core financial statements, identify the mandatory reporting requirements, and look at how these statements can be analyzed to assist
in decision making by management, investors, and other stakeholders.

3.2 Factors that Influence Financial Reports
3.2.1 Accounting Year-end
Choosing the fiscal year-end date is a strategic activity that requires careful consideration
because the decision made can result in operational and tax advantages. The year-end
will likely be influenced most by the company’s business cycle. For example, a retailer will
likely choose a year-end at the end of its busiest season, when inventory is at its lowest
levels. This makes the physical count easier and less costly, because there will be more
staff available and fewer adjustments to make before the books are closed. Planning a
fiscal year-end based on advantageous tax consequences can be tricky, but essentially it
means choosing a year-end that results in some temporary differences between certain
transactions accounted for in one fiscal year but not taxed until a subsequent fiscal year.
Alternatively, businesses that are not incorporated (e.g., proprietorships and partnerships) may choose the calendar year-end to coincide with Canada Revenue Agency,
for simplicity from a tax perspective. Whatever fiscal year-end is chosen, accounting
standards require that the financial statements be accrual based. This relates back to
the accounting principles of revenue recognition, in terms of when to record revenue,
and the matching principle, to ensure that all expenses related to that revenue recorded
are included. The statements are also the results of operations for a specified period of
time (the periodicity principle), called the reporting period. This raises the issues of
what, when, and how much detail to record for any transactions that occur near, at, or
subsequent to the reporting period year-end date.

3.2. Factors that Influence Financial Reports

41

Financial statements are often done on an interim basis each year. Interim reports can
be monthly, quarterly, or some other reporting period. For example, public companies in
Canada are required to produce quarterly financial statements. The accounting cycle has
not yet been completed, so the temporary revenue, expense, gains, and loss accounts are
not closed, and several end-of-period adjusting entries are recorded in order to ensure
that the accounting records are as complete as possible for the interim period being
reported. The annual published financial statements usually cover a fiscal or calendar
year (on rare occasions, an operating cycle, if longer than one year). After the release of
the year-end financial statement, the temporary accounts are closed to retained earnings,
and an updated post-closing trial balance for all the (permanent) balance sheet accounts
is completed to commence the new fiscal year.
There is also a period of time after the year-end date when certain events or transactions
detected in the new fiscal year may need to either be recorded and reported in the financial statements or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. For this reason, the
accounting records from the previous fiscal year are kept open to accrue any significant
entries and adjustments found in the new year that pertain to the fiscal year just ended.
This time period may be anywhere from a few days to several weeks or months, depending
on the size of the company. The end of this time marks the point at which the temporary
accounts for the old fiscal year are closed and the financial statements are completed and
officially published.
The following are examples of these types of transactions.

• Inventory – the physical inventory count that takes place as soon after the yearend date as possible. The total amount from the physical count is compared to the
ending balance in the inventory subledgers, and an adjusting entry recorded for the
difference. Since the accounting standards state that inventory is to be valuated
each reporting date at the lower of cost and net realizable value (LCNRV), a
write-down of inventory due to shrinkage may be required.
• Invoices Received after Year-end – this relates to goods and services received from
suppliers before the year-end date, but not yet recorded. For example, companies
purchasing goods from a supplier close to the year-end date usually receive the
goods with a packing slip that details the types and quantities of goods received
as well as the total cost. Once the goods are received and verified, the entry to
record the goods and recognize the accounts payable will occur with the packing
slip and the company’s own purchase order being the source documents for the
accounting entry. Recording entries relating to purchasing services, on the other
hand, can be tricky since there is no packing slip involved when purchasing services.
If the supplier providing the services does not leave an invoice with the purchaser as
soon as the services have been completed, it will be sent at some later date, usually
sometime during the following month of the new fiscal year. Keeping the books open
for a time after the year-end date allows the company extra time to catch and record

42

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

any significant transactions that are discovered during the next fiscal year that might
otherwise be missed.

Any significant subsequent event that occurs after the fiscal year-end should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year just ended. An example might
be where early in 2016 vandals damage some buildings and equipment. If the repair or
replacement costs are material, these costs, though correctly paid and recorded in 2016,
should be disclosed in the financial statements of the year just ended. This will ensure
that the company stakeholders have access to all the relevant information.

3.2.2 Changes in Accounting Estimates, Changes in Accounting
Policy, and Correction of Errors
Financial statements can be impacted by changes in accounting policies, changes in
estimates, and correction of errors. These were first introduced in the introductory accounting course and will also be discussed in detail in the next intermediate accounting
course. However, it is worth including a review at this time because they can significantly
affect the financial statements.
Changes in Accounting Estimates
Accounting is full of estimates that are based on the best information available at the time.
As new information becomes available, estimates may need to be changed. Examples of
changing estimates would be changing the useful life, residual value, or the depreciation
method used to match use of the assets with revenues earned. Other estimates involve
uncollectible receivables, revenue recognition for long-term contracts, asset impairment
losses, and pension expense assumptions. Changes in accounting estimates are applied
prospectively, meaning they are applied to the current fiscal year if the accounting
records have not yet been closed and for all future years going forward.
Changes in Accounting Policy
The accounting treatment for a change in accounting policy is retrospective adjustment
with restatement. Retrospective application means that the company deals with the error
or omission as though it had always been corrected.
Examples of changes in accounting policies are:

• changes in valuation methods for inventory such as changing from FIFO to weighted
average cost

3.2. Factors that Influence Financial Reports

43

• changes in classification, presentation, and measurement of financial assets and liabilities under categories specified in the accounting standards such as investments
classified as fair value reported through net income (FVNI), amortized cost (AC), or
fair value reported through OCI (FVOCI) (IFRS only). Details of these are discussed
in the chapter on intercorporate investments, later in this text.
• changes in the basis of measurement of non-current assets such as historical cost
and revaluation basis
• changes in the basis used for accruals in the preparation of financial statements
Management must consistently review its accounting policies to ensure they comply with
the latest pronouncements by IFRS or ASPE and to ensure the most relevant and reliable financial information for the stakeholders. Accounting policies must also be applied
consistently to promote comparability between financial statements for different accounting periods. For this reason, a change in accounting policy is only allowed under two
conditions:
1. due to changes in a primary source of GAAP
2. applied voluntarily by management to enhance the relevance and reliability of information contained in the financial statements for IFRS. ASPE has some exceptions to
this “relevance and reliability” rule to provide flexibility for changes from one existing
accounting standard to another.
As a rule, changes in accounting policies must be applied retrospectively with restatement to the financial statements. Retrospective application means that the company
implements the change in accounting policy as though it had always been applied. Consequently, the company will adjust all comparative amounts presented in the financial
statements affected by the change in accounting policy for each prior period reported.
Retrospective application reduces the risk of changing policies to manage earnings aggressively because the restatement is made to all prior years as well as to the current
year. If this were not the case, the change made to a single year could materially affect the
statement of income for the current fiscal year. A cumulative amount for the restatement
is estimated and adjusted to the opening retained earnings balance of the current year,
net of taxes, in the statement of changes in equity (IFRS) or the statement of retained
earnings (ASPE). This will be discussed and illustrated later in this chapter.
Retrospective application of a change in accounting policy may be exempted in the following circumstances.
• A transitional provision of the changed standard allows the prospective application
of a new accounting policy. Specific transitional guidance of IFRS or ASPE must be
followed in such circumstances.

44

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

• The application of a new accounting policy regarding events, transactions, and
circumstances that are substantially different from those that occurred in the past.
• The effect of the retrospective application of a change in accounting policy is immaterial.
• The retrospective application of a change in accounting policy is impracticable. This
may be the case where a company has not collected sufficient data to enable
an objective assessment of the effect of a change in accounting estimates and it
would be unfeasible or impractical to reconstruct the data. Where impracticability
impairs a company’s ability to apply a change in accounting policy retrospectively
from the earliest prior period presented, the new accounting policy must be applied
prospectively from the beginning of the earliest period feasible, which may be the
current period.

The following are the required disclosures in the notes to the financial statements when a
change in accounting policy is implemented:

• Title of IFRS or ASPE standard
• Nature of change in accounting policy
• Reasons for change in accounting policy
• Amount of adjustments in current and prior periods presented
• Where retrospective application is impracticable, the conditions that caused the
impracticality (CPA Canada, 2011).

Changes Due to Accounting Errors or Omissions
The accounting treatment for an error or omission is a retrospective adjustment with
restatement. For example, an accounting error in inventory originating in the current
fiscal year is detected within the current fiscal year while the accounting records are still
open. The inventory error correction is recorded as soon as possible to the applicable
accounts. However, if the accounting records are already closed when the inventory error
is discovered, the error is treated retrospectively. This means that the cumulative amount
due to the inventory error would be calculated and recorded, net of taxes, to the current
year’s opening retained earnings balance. If the financial statements are comparative and
include previous year’s data, this data is also restated to include the error correction. This
will be discussed and illustrated later in this chapter.

As can be seen from the flow of the numbers above, the net income from the statement
of income becomes the opening amount for the statement of comprehensive income (a
statement required for all IFRS only companies).
Comprehensive income starts with net income/loss and includes certain gains or losses
called other comprehensive income (OCI) that are not already reported in net income.
The most notable examples for purposes of this course are:

48

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

• unrealized gains or losses for investments classified as fair value through OCI (FVOCI),
resulting from changes in their fair value while the investment is being held (Chapter 8)
• gains/losses resulting from the application of the revaluation method for property,
plant and equipment, and intangibles (Chapter 9)
In the next intermediate accounting course, another OCI item is the remeasurement gains
and losses regarding defined benefit pension plans.
To summarize:
IFRS companies must report:
• Other comprehensive income (OCI) = certain gains or losses not already included
in net income, net of tax, with tax amount disclosed
• Total comprehensive income = net income/loss +/- other comprehensive income
(OCI)
Returning to the Wellbourn financial statements, looking at the statement of comprehensive income, net income closes to retained earnings, while any other comprehensive
income (OCI) gain or loss closes to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)
in the statement of changes in equity. The AOCI account is similar to a retained earnings
account, except that AOCI only accumulates items from OCI.
To summarize:
• Retained earnings accumulate net income/loss over time. (ASPE and IFRS)
• AOCI accumulates other comprehensive income (OCI)/losses over time. (IFRS only)
It should also be noted that IFRS companies can choose to keep the statement of income separate from the statement of comprehensive income, or they can combine the
two statements into one report called the statement of income and comprehensive
income, which will be discussed in more detail in the next section.
Looking at the Wellbourn statement of changes in equity, note that the total column balances to the equity section of the statement of financial position/balance sheet (SFP/BS).
The final link between all the financial statements is regarding the statement of cash
flows (SCF), where the ending cash balance must be equal to the cash balance reported
in the SFP/BS. This completes the loop of interconnecting accounts and amounts.

3.4. Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income

3.3.1 Financial Statement Differences Between IFRS and ASPE
The core financial statements shown above illustrate the types of statements required for
IFRS companies. They are the following:

• a statement of income
• a statement of comprehensive income
• a worksheet-style statement of changes in equity with all the equity accounts included
• a statement of financial position
• a statement of cash flows
• notes to the financial statements

IFRS requires the comparative previous year amounts be reported as well as disclosure
of the earnings per share. ASPE does not require these disclosures. IFRS requires the
statement of comprehensive income (or a combined statement of income and comprehensive income), whereas ASPE only requires a statement of income because comprehensive income does not exist. The statement of changes in equity required by IFRS shown
in the Wellbourn example above now becomes a more simplified statement of retained
earnings for ASPE, where only the details for retained earnings are reported (though any
changes in shareholder equity accounts must be disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements). The remaining equity accounts such as common shares and contributed
surplus are reported as ending balances directly in the balance sheet for ASPE (called
the statement of financial position for IFRS companies).

3.4 Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income
As previously stated, net income is a measure of return on capital and, hence, of performance. This means that investors and creditors can often estimate the company’s future
earnings and profitability based on an evaluation of its past performance as reported in net
income. Comparing a company’s current performance with its past performance creates
trends that can have a predictive, though not guaranteed, value about future earnings
performance. Additionally, comparing a company’s performance with industry standards
helps to assess the risks of not achieving goals compared to competitor companies in the
same industry sector.

50

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

As previously mentioned, all the core financial statements are based on accrual accounting. Accrual accounting, in turn, is based on a series of standards-based processes and
estimates. Some of these estimates have more measurement uncertainty than others,
and some estimates are inherently more conservative than others. This in turn affects the
quality of earnings reported in an income statement.
Quality of earnings – the amount of earnings attributable to sustainable ongoing core
business activities rather than to “artificial profits” arising from:

• differences in earnings due to applying the various accounting policy choices such
as FIFO or weighted average cost for inventory valuation or straight-line, decliningbalance, or units-of-production depreciation methods
• the use of estimates such as those for estimating bad debt or warranty provisions
• the presence of significant amounts of non-operating gains and losses compared to
income from continuing operations
• the inclusion of unreliable items such as inappropriate contingent gains
• management bias and reported amounts not objectively determined
• differences due to IFRS or ASPE application of standards
• information that is not concise or clearly presented and is poorly understood, resulting in potential misstatement

Lower quality earnings will include significant amounts of the items listed. If the quality of
earnings is low, more risk is associated with the financial statements, and investors and
creditors will place less reliance on them.
Single-step and Multiple-step Statement of Income
Single-step, multiple-step, or any condensed formats used in a statement of income are
not specified GAAP requirements. Companies can choose whichever format best suits
their reporting needs. Smaller privately held companies tend to use the simpler singlestep format, while publicly traded companies tend to use the multiple-step format. When
condensed formats are used, they are supplemented by extensive disclosures in the
notes to the financial statements and cross-referenced to the respective line items in the
statement of income.
The Wellbourn Services Ltd. statement of income, shown earlier, is an example of a
typical single-step income statement. For this type of statement, revenue and expenses
are each reported in the two sections for continuing operations. Discontinued operations
are separately reported below the continuing operations. The separate disclosure and

3.4. Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income

51

format for the discontinued operations section is a reporting requirement and is discussed
and illustrated below. The condensed or single-step formats make the statement simple
to complete and keeps sensitive information out of the hands of competitive companies,
but provides little in the way of analytical detail.
The multiple-step income statement format provides much more detail. Below is an
example of a multiple-step statement of income for Toulon Ltd., an IFRS company, for the
year ended December 31, 2015.

Other revenue and expenses section is to report non-operating transactions not due to
typical daily business activities. For example, if a company sells retail goods, any interest
expense incurred is a finance cost, and is not due to being in the retail business.
Toulon reported four non-operating items:
• Dividend revenue would be for dividends received from an investment in shares of
another company
• Interest income from investments would likely be from an investment in bonds of
another company
• Gain from the sale of trading investments would be for the profit made when the
investment was sold. In this case, the investment is classified as fair value through
net income (FVNI), which means any changes in the investment’s fair value at each
reporting date, or profit upon sale, are reported as a gain/loss in net income
• Interest expense would be any interest paid on amounts owed to various creditors.
This is considered to be a financing expense and not an operating expense, unless
the company is a finance company.
Other examples of non-operating items are listed below:
• write-down of inventory
• impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses on PPE, intangible assets,
and goodwill
• foreign currency exchange gains or losses
• gain or loss from asset disposal or from long-lived assets reclassified as held for
sale

54

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

• interest expense by current liabilities, long-term liabilities, and capital lease obligations
• unusual items (not typical and infrequent)
The multiple-step format with its section subtotals makes performance analysis and ratio
calculations such as gross profit margins easier to complete and makes it easier to assess
the company’s future earnings potential. The multiple-step format also enables investors
and creditors to evaluate company performance results from continuing and ongoing
operations having a high predictive value compared to non-operating or unusual items
having little predictive value.
Operating Expenses
Expenses from operations must be reported by their nature and, optionally, by function
(IFRS). Expenses by nature relate to the type of expense or the source of expense
such as salaries, insurance, advertising, travel and entertainment, supplies expense,
depreciation and amortization, and utilities expense, to name a few. The statement for
Toulon Ltd. is an example of reporting expenses by nature. Reporting expenses by
nature is mandatory for IFRS companies; therefore, if the statement of income reports
expenses by function, expenses by nature would also have to be reported either as a
breakdown within each function in the statement of income itself or in the notes to the
financial statements.
Expenses by function relate to how various expenses are incurred within the various
departments and activities of a company. Expenses by function include activities such as
the following:
• sales and marketing
• production
• office and administration
• research and development
Common costs such as utilities, supplies, insurance, and property tax expenses would
have to be allocated between the various functions using a reasonable basis such as
square footage or each department’s proportional share of overall expenses. This allocation process can be cumbersome and will require more time, effort, and professional
judgement.
The sum of all the revenues, expenses, gains, and losses to this point represents the
income or loss from continuing operations. This is a key component used in performance analysis and will be discussed later in this chapter.

3.4. Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income

55

Income Tax Allocations
Intra-period tax allocation is the process of allocating income tax expense to various
categories within the statement of income, comprehensive income, and retained earnings.
For example, income taxes are to be allocated to the following four categories:
1. Income from continuing operations before taxes
2. Discontinued operations, net of tax
3. Each item reported as other comprehensive income, net of tax
4. Each item regarding retrospective restatement for changes in accounting policy or
correction of prior period errors reported in retained earnings, net of tax, which is
also discussed later in this chapter
The purpose of these allocations is to make the information within the statements more
informative and complete. For example, Toulon’s statement of income for the year ending
December 31, 2015, allocates 30% income tax as follows:
• Income from continuing operations of $850,000 ($2,833,000 × 30%)
• Loss from discontinued operations of $45,000 ($150,000 × 30%)
• Loss from disposal of discontinued operations of $18,000 ($60,000 × 30%)
• Comprehensive income gain from FVOCI investments of $6,000 ($20,000 × 30%)
All companies are required to report each of the categories above net of their tax effects.
This makes analyses of operating results within the company itself and of its competitors
more comparable and meaningful.
Discontinued operations
Sometimes companies will sell or shut down certain business components or operations
because the operating segment or component is no longer profitable, or they may wish
to focus their resources on other business components. To be separately reportable
as a discontinued operation in the statement of income, the business component being
discontinued must have its own clearly distinguishable operations and cash flows, referred
to as a cash-generating unit (CGU) for IFRS companies. Examples are a major business
line or geographical area. If the discontinued operation has not yet been sold, there must
be a formal plan in place to dispose of the component within one year and to report it as
a discontinued operation.

56

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

The items reported in this section of the statement of income are to be separated into two
reporting lines:
• Gains or losses in operations prior to disposal of the CGU, net of tax, with tax
amount disclosed
• Gains or losses in operations on disposal of the CGU, net of tax, with the tax
amounts disclosed
Net Income and Comprehensive Income
Note that the statement for Toulon Ltd. combines net income and total comprehensive
income. Two statements would be prepared for IFRS companies that prefer to separate
net income from comprehensive income. The statement of income, ends at net income
(highlighted in yellow). A second statement, called the statement of comprehensive
income, would start with net income and include any other comprehensive income (OCI)
items. The Wellbourn financial statement (shown in section 3.3 of this chapter) is an
example of separating net income and total comprehensive income into two statements.
Another item that is important to disclose in the financial statements is the non-controlling
interest (NCI) reported for net income and total comprehensive income. This is the
portion of equity ownership in an associate (subsidiary) that is not attributable to the
parent company (Toulon, in our example) that has a controlling interest (greater than
50% but less than 100% ownership) in the acquired company’s net assets. Toulon must
consolidate the associate’s financial data with its own and report as a single entity to
comply with IFRS standards. Consider that if a company purchases 80% of the net assets
of another company, the remaining 20% must therefore be owned by outside investors.
This 20% amount must be reported as the non-controlling interest to ensure that investors
and creditors of the company holding 80% (parent) are adequately informed about the true
value of the net assets owned by the parent company versus outside investors.
For ASPE companies using a multiple-step format, the statement of income would look
virtually the same as the example for Toulon above and would include all the line items
up to the net income amount (highlighted in yellow). As previously stated, comprehensive
income is an IFRS concept only; it is not applicable to ASPE.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share represent the amount of income attributable to each outstanding
common share, as shown in the calculation below:

Basic earnings per share (EPS) =

Net income − preferred dividends
Weighted average number of
common shares outstanding

3.5. Statement of Changes in Equity (IFRS) and Statement of Retained Earnings (ASPE)

57

The earnings per share amounts are not required for ASPE companies. This is because
ownership of privately owned companies is often held by only a few investors, compared
to publicly-traded IFRS companies where shares are held by many investors.
For IFRS companies, basic earnings per share excludes OCI and any non-controlling
interests. EPS is to be reported on the face of the statement of income as follows:

• Basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations
• Basic and diluted EPS from discontinued operations, if any

The term basic earnings per share refers to IFRS companies with a simple capital structure consisting of common shares and perhaps non-convertible preferred shares or nonconvertible bonds. Reporting diluted earnings per share is required when companies
hold financial instruments such as options or warrants, convertible bonds, or convertible
preferred shares, where the holders of these instruments can convert them into common
shares at a future date. The impact of these types of financial instruments is the potential
future dilution of common shares and the effect this could have on earnings per share to
the common shareholders. Details about diluted earnings per share will be covered in the
next intermediate accounting course.

3.5 Statement of Changes in Equity (IFRS) and
Statement of Retained Earnings (ASPE)
Recall that net income or loss is closed to retained earnings. For ASPE companies, there
is no comprehensive income (OCI) and therefore no AOCI account in equity. With this
simpler reporting requirement, ASPE companies report retained earnings in the balance
sheet and detail any changes in retained earnings that took place during the reporting
period in the statement of retained earnings. An example of a statement of retained
earnings is that of Arctic Services Ltd., for the year ended December 31, 2015.

As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, any error corrections from prior periods or
allowable changes in accounting policies will result in a reporting requirement to restate
the opening retained earnings balance for the current period. Each error and change in
accounting policy item is separately reported, net of tax, with the tax amount disclosed.
The retained earnings opening balance is restated and a detailed description is included
in the notes to the financial statements. The journal entry for the two restatement items

The statement of retained earnings also includes any current period net income or loss
followed by any cash or stock dividends declared by the board of directors. This detail
provides important information to investors and creditors regarding the proportion of net
income that is distributed to the shareholders through a dividend compared to the net
income retained for future business purposes such as investment or expansion.
ASPE companies may choose to combine the statement of income and the statement of
retained earnings. In this case, the statement of retained earnings is incorporated at the

bottom of the statement of income, starting with net income as shown in a simple example

For IFRS companies, net income is closed out to retained earnings, and other comprehensive income (OCI), if any, is closed out to accumulated other comprehensive income
(AOCI). An example of how that works is illustrated in the Wellbourn financial statements
included in section 3.3 of this chapter. Both retained earnings and AOCI are reported
in the equity section of the statement of financial position (SFP) and the statement of
changes in equity (IFRS).
For IFRS companies, each account from the equity section of the SFP is to be reported
in the statement of changes in equity. The following is an example of the statement of
changes in equity for an IFRS company, Velton Ltd., for the year ended December 31,
2015. Note how this statement is worksheet style, which discloses each retrospective
adjustment net of tax, followed by a restatement of the equity account opening balances.
Each equity account opening balance is then reconciled to its respective closing balance
by reporting the changes that occurred during the year, such as the issuance/retirement
of shares, net income, and dividends. The statement also must report total comprehensive income. Any non-controlling interest would also be reported (as a separate
column), the same as was required and illustrated for Toulon Ltd.’s statement of income
presented earlier.

If the company sustained net losses over several years and retained earnings were insufficient to absorb these losses, retained earnings would have a debit balance and would
be reported on the SFP as a deficit.

3.6 Analysis of Statement of Income and Statement of
Changes in Equity
Financial statement analysis is an evaluative process of determining the past, current,
and projected performance of a company. Financial statements report financial data;
however, this information must be evaluated to be more useful to investors, shareholders,
managers, and other stakeholders. Several techniques are commonly used for financial
statement analysis. They were originally presented in the introductory accounting course.
A summary review of these techniques follows.
Horizontal analysis compares two or more years of financial data in both dollar amounts
and percentage form. An income statement and SFP/BS with comparative data from
prior years are examples of where horizontal analysis is incorporated into the financial
statements to enhance evaluation. Trends can emerge that are considered as either
favourable or unfavourable in terms of company performance.
Vertical or common-size analysis occurs when each category of accounts on the income statement or SFP/BS is shown as a percentage of a total. For example, vertical
analysis is used to evaluate the statement of income such as the percentage that gross
profit is to sales or the percentages that operating expenses are to sales. Similarly,
vertical analysis of the SFP/BS may be used to evaluate what percentage equity is to
total assets. This ratio tells investors what proportion of the net assets is being retained

62

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

by the company’s investors compared to the company’s creditors.
Ratio analysis calculates statistical relationships between data. Ratio analysis is used
to evaluate various aspects of a company’s financial performance such as its efficiency,
liquidity, profitability, and solvency. Gross profit (net income divided by net sales or
revenue) and earnings per share (EPS) are examples of key ratios used to evaluate
income and changes in equity. One of the most widely used ratios by investors to assess
company performance is the price-earnings (P/E) ratio (market price per share divided
by EPS). The P/E ratio is the most widely quoted measure that investors use as an
indicator of future growth and of risk related to a company’s earnings when establishing
the market price of the shares. The trend of the various ratios over time is assessed
to see if performance is improving or deteriorating. Ratios are also assessed across
different companies in the same industry sector to see how they compare. Ratios are a
key component to financial statement analysis.
Segmented Reporting
The statement of income can be segmented, or disaggregated, to enhance performance
analysis. The statement can be segmented in various ways such as by geography or by
type of product or service. As a point of interest, other segmented financial statements
include the SFP/BS and the statement of cash flow covered in the next chapter.
For ASPE, there is currently no guidance regarding segmented reporting. For IFRS
companies, a segment must meet several characteristics and quantitative thresholds to
be a reportable segment for purposes of the published financial statements. Segmented
reporting can set apart business components that have a strong financial performance
from those that are weak or are negative “losing” performers. Management can use this
information to make decisions about which components to keep and which components
to discontinue as part of their overall business strategy. Keep in mind that not all business
components that experience chronic losses should be automatically discontinued. There
are strategic reasons for keeping a “losing” component. For example, retaining a borderline, or losing, segment that produces parts may guarantee access to these critical parts
when needed for production of a much larger product to continue uninterrupted. If the
parts manufacturing component is discontinued and disposed, this guaranteed access
will no longer exist and production in the larger sense can quickly grind to a halt, affecting
company sales and profits. Segmented reporting can also assist in forecasting future
sales, profits, and cash flows, since different components within a company can have
different gross margins, profitability, and risk.
There can be issues with segmented reporting. For example, accounting processes such
as allocation of common costs and elimination of inter-segment sales can be challenging.
A thorough knowledge of the business and the industry in which the company operates is
essential when utilizing segmented reports; otherwise, investors may find segmentation
meaningless or, at worst, draw incorrect conclusions about the performance of the business components. There can be reluctance to publish segmented information because

of the risk that competitors, suppliers, government agencies, and unions can use this
information to their advantage and to the detriment of the company.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe statement of income, the statement of
comprehensive income, and the statement of changes in equity, and
their role in accounting and business.
The statement of income reports on company performance over the reporting period
in terms of net income. The statement of comprehensive income is a concept only
used by IFRS companies that reports on other gains and losses not already reported
in net income. The statement of changes in equity (IFRS) reports on what changes took
place in each of the equity accounts for the reporting period. For ASPE, this statement
is a much simpler statement of retained earnings. Together, these statements enable
the company stakeholders such as management, investors, and creditors to assess the
financial health of the company and its ability to generate profits and repay debt. Each
accounting standard (IFRS and ASPE) has minimum reporting requirements, which were
discussed in this chapter.

LO 2: Identify the factors that influence what is reported in the
statement of income, the statement of comprehensive income, and
the statement of changes in equity.
The accounting standards require that all statements are reported on an accrual basis
over a specific period of time (periodicity assumption) so that anything relevant to decision

64

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

making is included (full disclosure principle). To ensure this, various adjusting entries are
recorded to make certain that the accounting records are up to date, and an accounting
fiscal year-end date is carefully chosen. Accrual entries include any revenues earned
but not yet recorded, whether paid or not (revenue recognition principle), and any expenses where goods and services have been received but not yet recorded, whether paid
or not (matching principle). Other adjusting entries include prepayment items (prepaid
expenses and unearned revenues), the estimate for bad debt expense, depreciation and
amortization of depreciable assets, unrealized gains and losses of certain assets, and
any impairment or write-down entries, if required. Also considered are subsequent events
that occur after the year-end date and whether to include them in the financial statements
or in the notes to the financial statements. Changes in accounting estimates (prospective
treatment with restatement), correcting accounting errors (retrospective treatment with
restatement), and changes in accounting policy (retrospective treatment) can all affect
the financial statements.

LO 3: Identify the core financial statements and explain how they
interconnect together.
The core financial statements interconnect to complete an overall picture of a company’s
performance over the reporting period (income statement) as well as its current financial
state (SFP/BS). Starting with performance, the net income from the statement of income
becomes the first amount reported on the statement of comprehensive income. Added to
that is other comprehensive income (OCI), which reports any gains or losses not already
reported in net income (IFRS only). Net income and OCI each flow to the statement of
changes in equity, which reports on all the items that have affected the equity accounts
during the reporting period. Together, these three financial statements are used to assess
the company performance for the reporting period. The statement of cash flows reconciles
cash and cash equivalent opening balances at the beginning of the reporting period to
the closing balances at the end of the period. These changes are broken down into
sources of cash inflows and outflows. Cash inflows could be from customers, issuing
debt, or issuing share capital, while cash outflows could be from payments to suppliers,
to employees, the purchase of assets, the payment of debt, any retirement of share
capital, or the payment of dividends. These activities are separated and reported into
the operating, investing, and financing section. The net amount of change represents the
total change between the opening cash and cash equivalent balance to the closing cash
and cash equivalent balance. The SFP/BS completes the set of core financial statements.
It provides a snapshot at the end of the reporting period, such as month-end or yearend, and identifies the company resources (assets) and the claims to these resources
(liabilities). The remaining net assets belong to the various classes of shareholders. The
ending cash and cash equivalent balance of the statement of cash flow must reconcile
to the cash and cash equivalent balances in the SFP/BS, and the statement of changes
in equity totals must reconcile to the SFP/BS equity section, so that all the statements fit

Chapter Summary

65

together into a single reconciled network of financial information.
There are differences between IFRS and ASPE reporting standards. For APSE, the
statement of income is quite similar but without the requirement for comparative years’
data and earnings per share reporting. Comprehensive income is not a concept used
by ASPE so there is no requirement for a statement of comprehensive income. ASPE
companies report any changes in retained earnings through the statement of retained
earnings, which is a much simpler statement that reports only the changes in the retained
earnings account compared to the statement of changes in equity (IFRS), which reports
the changes for all equity accounts.

LO 4: Describe the various formats used for the statement of income
and the statement of comprehensive income, and identify the
various reporting requirements for companies following IFRS and
ASPE.
The purpose of the statement of income is to identify the revenues and expenses that
comprise a company’s net income. A comprehensive income statement, required by
IFRS, identifies any gains and losses not already included in the statement of income.
Together, these statements enable management, creditors, and investors to assess a
company’s financial performance for the reporting period. Comparing current with past
performance, stakeholders can use these statements to predict future earnings and profitability. Since accounting is accrual-based, uncertainty exists in terms of the accuracy
and reliability of the data used in the estimates. Net income (earnings) that can be attributable to sustainable ongoing core business activities are higher quality earnings than
artificial numbers generated from applying accounting processes, determining various
estimates, or gains and losses from non-operating business activities. The lower the
quality of earnings, the less reliance will be placed on them by investors and creditors.
The statement of income can be a simple single-step or a more complex multiple-step
format. Either one has its advantages and disadvantages. No matter which format is
used, certain mandatory reporting requirements for both IFRS and ASPE exist, such as
separate reporting for continuing operations and discontinued operations. To be reported
as a discontinued operation, the business component must meet the definition of a cashgenerating unit and a formal plan to dispose of the business component must exist.
Companies can choose to report operating expenses by nature (type of expense) or by
function (which department incurred the expense). However, if expenses by function is
used, additional reporting of certain line items by nature is still required for both IFRS and
ASPE companies such as inventory expensed, depreciation, amortization, finance costs,
inventory write-downs, and income taxes to name a few. IFRS companies can choose
to keep the statement of income separate from the statement of comprehensive income
or combine them into a single statement: the statement of income and comprehensive

66

Financial Reports: Statement of Income, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity

income. For IFRS companies, the earnings per share are reporting requirements.

LO 5: Describe the various formats used to report the changes in
equity for IFRS and ASPE companies, and identify the reporting
requirements.
For ASPE companies the various sources of change occurring during the reporting period
for retained earnings is reported, while for IFRS companies changes to each of the
equity accounts is identified, usually in a worksheet style with each account assigned
to a column. One important aspect to either statement is the retrospective reporting for
changes in accounting policies or corrections of errors from prior periods. The opening
balance for retained earnings is restated by the amount of the change or error, net of tax,
with the tax amount disclosed. Other line items for these statements include net income or
loss and dividends declared. For IFRS companies reporting will also include any changes
to the share capital accounts and accumulated other comprehensive income (resulting
from OCI items recorded in the reporting period).

LO 6: Identify and describe the types of analysis techniques that can
be used for income and equity statements.
Analysis of the financial statements is critical to decision making and to properly assess
the overall financial health of a company. Analysis transforms the data into meaningful
information for management, investors, creditors, and other company stakeholders. By
evaluating the financial data, trends can be identified which can be used to predict the
company’s future performance. Some techniques used on financial statements include
horizontal analysis that compares data from multiple years, vertical analysis that expresses certain subtotals (gross profit) as a percentage of a total amount (sales), and
ratio analysis that highlights important relationships between data.

EXERCISE 3–10
Vivando Ltd. follows IFRS and reported income from continuing operations before income
tax of $1,820,000 in 2015. The year-end is December 31, 2015, and the company
had 225,000 outstanding common shares throughout the 2015 fiscal year. Additional
transactions not considered in the $1,820,000 are listed below:
In 2015, Vivando sold equipment of $75,000. The equipment had originally cost $92,000
and had accumulated depreciation to date of $33,400. The gain or loss is considered
ordinary.
The company discontinued operations of one of its subsidiaries, disposing of it during the
current year at a total loss of $180,600 before tax. Assume that this transaction meets the
criteria for discontinued operations. The loss on operation of the discontinued subsidiary
was $68,000 before tax. The loss from disposal of the subsidiary was $112,600 before
tax.
The sum of $180,200 was received because of a lawsuit for a breached 2011 contract.
Before the decision, legal counsel was uncertain about the outcome of the suit and had
not established a receivable.
In 2015, the company reviewed its accounts receivable and determined that $125,600 of
accounts receivable that had been carried for years appeared unlikely to be collected. No
allowance for doubtful accounts was previously set up.
An internal audit discovered that amortization of intangible assets was understated by
$22,800 (net of tax) in a prior period. The amount was charged against retained earnings.
Required: Analyze the above information and prepare an income statement for the year
2015, starting with income from continuing operations before income tax (Hint: refer to
the Toulon Ltd. example in Section 4 of this chapter). Calculate earnings per share as it
should be shown on the face of the income statement. Assume a total effective tax rate
of 25% on all items, unless otherwise indicated.

Chapter 4
Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

Amazon’s Cash Flow Position
In 2014, Amazon reported its quarterly earnings for their year-to-date earnings
release. Since the trend has been for their profits to slide downward in the recent past,
initial speculation was that this was causing investor discontent resulting in decreasing
stock prices. But was it?
Even though profits were on a downward trend, the earnings releases showed that
the operating section of the statement of cash flow (SCF) was reporting some healthy
net cash balances that were much higher than net income. This is often caused by
net income including large amounts of non-cash depreciation expense.
Moreover, when looking at free cash flow, it could be seen that Amazon had been
making huge amounts of investment purchases, causing a sharp drop in the free
cash flow levels compared to the operating section of the SCF. However, even with
these gigantic investment purchases, free cash flow continued to soar well above its
net income counterpart by more than $1 billion. What this tells investors is that there
are timing differences between what is reported as net income on an accrual basis
and reported as cash flows on strictly a cash basis.
The key to such cash flows success lies in the cash conversion cycle (CCC). This is
a metric that measures how many days it takes for a company to pay it suppliers for
its resale inventory purchases compared to how many days it takes to convert this
inventory back into cash when it is sold and the customer pays their account. For
example, if it takes 45 days to pay the supplier for resale inventory and only 40 days
to sell and receive the cash from the customer, this creates a negative CCC of 5 days
of access to additional cash flows. In industry, Costco and Walmart have been doing
well at maintaining single-digit CCC’s but Amazon tops the chart at an impressive
negative 30.6 days in 2013. Apple also managed to achieve a negative CCC in 2013,
making these two companies cash-generating giants in an often-risky high-tech world.
Amazon is using this internal access to additional cash to achieve significant levels of
growth; from originally an online merchant of books to a wide variety of products
and services, and, most recently, to video streaming. Simply put, Amazon can
expand without borrowing from the bank, or from issuing more stock. This has
landed Amazon’s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezoz, an enviable spot in Harvard Business
Review’s list of best performing CEOs in the world.

75

76

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

So, which part of the CCC metric is Amazon leveraging the most? While it could be
good inventory management, it is not. It is the length of time Amazon takes to pay its
suppliers. In 2013, the company took a massive 95.8 days to pay its suppliers, a fact
that suppliers may not be willing to accept forever.
Though it might have been too early to tell, some of the more recent earnings release
figures for Amazon are starting to show the possibility that the CCC metric may
be starting to increase. This shift might be a cause for concern for the investors.
Moreover, this could be the real reason why Amazon’s stock price was faltering in
2014 rather than because of the decreasing profits initially considered by many to be
the culprit.

Introduction
In Chapter 3 we discussed three of the core financial statements. This chapter will
now discuss the remaining two, which are the SFP/BS, and the SCF. Both of these
statements are critical tools used to assess a company’s financial position and its current
cash resources, as explained in the opening story about Amazon. Cash is one of the
most critical assets to success as will be discussed in a subsequent chapter on cash and
receivables. How an investor knows when to invest in a company and how a creditor
knows when to extend credit to a company is the topic of this chapter.
NOTE: IFRS refers to the balance sheet as the statement of financial position (SFP) and
ASPE continues to use the term balance sheet (BS). To simplify the terminology, this
chapter will refer to this statement as the SFP/BS, unless specific reference to either one
is necessary.

4.1 Financial Reports: Overview
As discussed previously, investors and creditors assess a company’s overall financial
health by using published financial statements. Recall that the previous chapter about
financial reporting illustrated how the core financial statements link into a cohesive network of financial information. The illustration in that chapter showed how the ending
cash balance from the statement of cash flows (SCF) is also the ending cash balance
in the SFP/BS. This is the final link that completes the connection of the core financial
statements.

For example, in the SFP/BS for Wellbourn Services Ltd. at December 31 (which we saw
also in the previous chapter) note how the cash ending balance links the two statements.

The SFP/BS provides information about a company’s resources (assets) at a specific
point in time and whether these resources are financed mainly by debt (current and longterm liabilities) or equity (shareholders’ equity). In other words, the SFP/BS provides
the information needed to assess a company’s liquidity and solvency. Combined, these
represent a company’s financial flexibility.

80

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

Recall the basic accounting equation:

Assets = Liabilities + Equity
The key issues to consider regarding the SFP/BS are the valuation and management of
resources (assets) and the recognition and timing of debt obligations (liabilities). Reporting the results within the SFP/BS creates a critical reporting tool to assess a company’s
overall financial health.
The statement of cash flows, discussed later in this chapter, identifies how the company
utilized its cash inflows and outflows over the reporting period. Since the SCF separates
cash flows into those resulting from operating activities versus investing and financing activities, investors and creditors can quickly see where the main sources of cash originate.
If cash sources are originating more from investing activities than from operations, this
means that the company is likely selling off some of its assets to cover its obligations. This
may be appropriate if these assets are idle and no longer contributing towards generating
profit, but otherwise, selling off useful assets could trigger a downward spiral, with profits
plummeting as a result. If cash sources are originating mainly from financing activities,
the company is likely sourcing its cash from debt or from issuing shares. Higher debt
requires more cash to make the principal and interest payments, and more shares means
that existing investors’ ownership is becoming diluted. Either scenario will be cause for
concern for both investors and creditors. Even if most of the cash sources are mainly
from operating activities, a large difference between net income and the total cash from
operating activities is a warning sign that investors and creditors should be digging deeper.
The bottom line after reviewing the two statements is: if debt is high and cash balances
are low, the greater the risk of failure.
The SFP/BS will now be discussed in detail.

4.2 Statement of Financial Position/Balance Sheet
The purpose of the SFP/BS is to report the assets of a company and the composition
of the claims against those assets by creditors and investors at a specific point in time.
Assets and liabilities come from several sources and are usually separated into current
and non-current (IFRS) or long-term (ASPE) categories.

4.2. Statement of Financial Position/Balance Sheet

4.2.1 Disclosure Requirements
IFRS (IAS 1) and ASPE (section 1521) identify the disclosure requirements for SFP/BS,
which are quite similar. Listed below are summary points for some of the more commonly
required disclosures for both standards:
• The application of the standards is required, with additional disclosures when necessary, so that the SFP/BS will be relevant and faithfully representative. Relevance
means that the information in the SFP/BS can make a difference in decision-making.
Faithfully representative means that the statement is complete, neutral, and free
from errors.
• Any material uncertainties about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern
are to be disclosed.
• Company name, name of the financial statement, and date must be provided.
• The SFP/BS is to report assets and liabilities separately in many cases. The schedule below lists many of the more common assets and liabilities that are to be separately reported.
In addition, any material classes of similar items are to be separately disclosed
in either the statement or in the notes to the financial statements (e.g., items of
property, plant, and equipment, types of inventories, or classes of equity share
capital).
• When preparing the SFP/BS, assets are not to be netted with liabilities. This does
not apply to contra accounts.
• Assets and liabilities are to be separated into current and non-current (long-term).
Some companies further report assets in order of their liquidity.
• The measurement basis used for each line item in the statement is to be disclosed.
Examples would be whether the company applied fair value, fair value less costs to
sell, cost, amortized cost, net realizable value, or lower of cost and net realizable
value (LCNRV) when preparing the statement.
• Due dates and interest rates for any financial instruments payable such as loans,
notes, mortgages, and bonds payable, as well as details about any security required
for the loan are to be disclosed.
• Cross-reference note disclosures to the related line items in the statement.
Below are the basic classifications for some of the more common reporting line items
and accounts. The focus is mainly IFRS for simplicity, though ASPE is substantially
similar. The required supplemental disclosures below focus on the measurement basis of

82

the various assets, the due dates, interest rates, and security conditions for non-current
liabilities; and the structure for each class of share capital in shareholders’ equity when
preparing a SFP/BS. These will be discussed in more detail in the chapters that follow in
the next intermediate accounting course.

Disclosures such as those listed in the classification schedule above may be presented
in parentheses beside the line item within the body of the SFP/BS, if the disclosure is not
lengthy. Otherwise, the disclosure is to be included in the notes to the financial statements
and cross-referenced to the corresponding line item in the SFP/BS.
Using parentheses tends to be more common for ASPE companies with simpler disclosure requirements. IFRS companies and larger ASPE companies extensively use the
cross-referencing method because of the more complex and lengthy notes disclosures
required.

thetical disclosure for the long-term liability. In the equity section, the class, authorized,
and outstanding shares are disclosed.
Taking a closer look at this statement, ASPE Company reports $1,387,000 in total assets
and $464,000 in corresponding obligations against those assets owing to suppliers and
other creditors.
On the topic of debt reporting, the current portion of long-term debt is a reported as a
current liability. The current portion of the long-term debt is the amount of principal that
will be paid within one year of the SFP/BS date.
For example, on December 31, 2014, ASPE Company signed a three-year, 2%, note.
Payments of $137,733 are payable each December 31. If the market rate was 2.75%,
the present value of the note would be $391,473 at the time of signing on December 31,
2014. Below is the payments schedule of the note using the effective interest method.

If the SFP/BS date is December 31, 2015, the current portion of the long-term debt to
report as a current liability would be $130,459 from the note payable payments schedule
above. Note that this amount comes from the year following the 2015 reporting year to
correspond with the principal amount owing within one year of the current reporting date
(December 31, 2015). The total amount owing as at December 31, 2015 is $264,506;
therefore, the long-term portion of $134,047 would be the amount owing net of the current
portion of $130,459. Below is how it would be reported in the SFP/BS at December 31,
2015:
Current Liabilities
Current portion of long-term note payable
Long-term Liabilities

$130,459
$134,047

If the current portion of the long-term debt is not reported as a current liability, there will
be a material reporting misstatement that would affect the assessment of the company’s
liquidity and solvency.

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

Total equity of $923,000 represents the remaining assets financed by the company shareholders. Ranking first are the preferred shareholders capital investors of $150,000. They
are usually reported before the common shares because they are senior to common
shares in terms of both dividend payouts and claims to resources if a company liquidates.
However, this is not a reporting requirement. The contributed surplus of $15,000 is
additional paid-in capital from shareholders. Examples of transactions that recognize
contributed surplus include:

• stock options such as an employee stock option plan, or other share-based compensation plan and issuance of convertible debentures
• for certain share re-purchase transactions where the purchase proceeds are lower
than the assigned value of the shares
• donated assets by shareholders
• defaulted shares subscriptions
• certain related party transactions (ASPE)

If there are more line items than simply common shares, a paid-in capital subtotal is also
required for IFRS companies. Paid-in capital is the total amount “paid in” by shareholders
and therefore not resulting from ongoing operations. It is comprised of all classes of share
capital plus contributed surplus, if any. Finally, the retained earnings line item is the total
net income accumulated by the company since its inception that has not been distributed
in dividends to the shareholders.
Below are other reporting requirements:

• The statement can be prepared on a consolidated basis. This means that there are
subsidiaries included where the reporting company is the parent company. Subsidiaries are investments in the shares of another company where the shares purchased are greater than 50%. In this case, there will be a line item called “noncontrolling interest” that must be included for the portion of the subsidiary owned by
other third-party investors.
• The presentation currency is stated as Canadian dollars and the level of rounding
can be to the nearest thousand dollars or million dollars, depending on the size of
the company.
• The financial data is to include the previous year (an IFRS disclosure requirement).
• An accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI) is an equity account
used only by IFRS companies to accumulate items reported in OCI in the statement

4.2. Statement of Financial Position/Balance Sheet

91

of comprehensive income. AOCI. Recall from the previous chapter that an example
of an OCI transaction would be the unrealized gains or losses from fair value adjustments while holding certain FVOCI investments. FVOCI investments and AOCI
will be covered in detail later in this course. For now, note the position of the AOCI
account in the equity section.

4.2.2 Factors Affecting the Statement of Financial Position/Balance
Sheet (SFP/BS)
Accounting Estimates, Changes in Accounting Policy, and Correction of Errors
These were discussed in the previous chapter, but a summary of the pertinent information
in this chapter is warranted because of their impact on the SFP/BS.
Financial statements can be affected by changes in accounting estimates, changes due
to accounting errors or omissions, and changes in accounting policies. These were first
introduced in the introductory accounting course and will also be discussed in detail in the
next intermediate accounting course. However, it is worth including a review at this time
because of the potentially significant effect on the financial statements.

Changes in Accounting Estimates
Accounting is full of estimates that are based on the best information available at the time.
As new information becomes available, estimates may need to be changed. Examples
of changing estimates would be the useful life, residual value, or the depreciation pattern
used to match the use of assets with revenues earned. Other changes in estimates
involve uncollectible receivables, asset impairment losses, and pension assumptions that
could affect the accrued pension asset/liability account in the SFP/BS. Changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively, meaning they are applied to the current
fiscal year if the accounting records have not yet been closed and for all future years
going forward.

Changes Due to Accounting Errors or Omissions
The accounting treatment for an error or omission is a retrospective adjustment with
restatement. Retrospective adjustment means that the company reports treat the error
or omission as though it had always been corrected. If an accounting error in inventory
originating in the current fiscal year is detected before the current year’s books are closed,
the inventory error correction is easily recorded to the current fiscal year accounts. If the

92

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

accounting records are already closed when the inventory error is discovered, the error
is adjusted to the inventory account and to retained earnings, net of taxes. This results
in a restatement of inventory and retained earnings in the current year. If the financial
statements are comparative and include previous year’s data, this data is also restated
to include the error correction from the previous year.

Changes in Accounting Policy
The accounting treatment for a change in accounting policy is retrospective adjustment
with restatement.
Examples of changes in accounting policies are:

• Changes in valuation methods for inventory such as changing from FIFO to weighted
average cost.
• Changes in financial assets and liabilities such as FVNI, FVOCI and AC investments
or certain lease obligations. Details of these are discussed in the chapter on intercorporate investments, later in this text.
• Changes in the basis of measurement of non-current assets such as historical cost
and revaluation.
• Changes in the basis used for accruals in the preparation of financial statements.

Accounting policies must be applied consistently to promote comparability between financial statements for different accounting periods. A change in accounting policy is only
allowed under the following two conditions:

• due to changes in a primary source of GAAP
• may be applied voluntarily by management to enhance the relevance and reliability
of information contained in the financial statements for IFRS. [ASPE has some
exceptions to this “relevance and reliability” rule to provide flexibility for changes
from one existing accounting standard to another.]

Changes in accounting policies are applied retrospectively in the financial statements.
As with accounting errors, retrospective application means that the company implements
the change in accounting policy as though it had always been applied. Consequently,
the company will adjust all comparative amounts presented in the financial statements

4.2. Statement of Financial Position/Balance Sheet

93

affected by the change in accounting policy for each prior period presented. Retrospective application reduces the risk of changing policies to manage earnings aggressively
because the restatement is made to all prior years as well as the current year. If this were
not the case, the change made to a single year could materially affect the statement of
income for the current fiscal year. A cumulative amount for the restatement is estimated
and adjusted to the affected asset or liability in the SFP/BS and to the opening retained
earnings balance of the current year, net of taxes, in the statement of changes in equity
(IFRS) or the statement of retained earnings (ASPE).

Contingencies, Provisions and Guarantees
In accounting, a contingency (ASPE) or provision (IFRS) exists when a material future event, or circumstance, could occur but cannot be predicted with certainty. IFRS
(IAS 37.10) has the following definitions regarding the various types of contingencies in
accounting (IFRS, 2015).
Key definitions [IAS 37.10]
Provision: a liability of uncertain timing or amount.
Liability:
• present obligation resulting from past events
• settlement is expected to result in an outflow of resources (payment)
Contingent liability:
• a possible obligation depending on whether some uncertain future event occurs,
or
• a present obligation but payment is not probable, or the amount cannot be
measured reliably
Contingent asset:
• a possible asset that arises from past events, and
• whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of
one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.

IAS 37 explains that a contingent liability is to be disclosed in the financial statement
notes. Figure 4.1 is a decision tree that identifies the various decision points when
determining if a potential obligation should be recognized and recorded, because it meets

94

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

the definition of a liability; added only to the notes, because it meets the definition of a
contingent liability; or omitted altogether because it fails to meet any of the relevant criteria
(Friedrich, Friedrich, & Spector, 2009).

IAS 37 also states that a contingent asset is not to be recorded until it is actually realized

96

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

but can be included in the notes if it is probable that an inflow of economic benefits will
occur (IFRS, 2012). If a note disclosure is made, management must take care not to
mislead the reader regarding its potential realization; if the potential asset is not probable,
it must not be disclosed.
ASPE is similar, but the provision is usually interpreted as “more likely than not” whereas
a contingent liability is one that is “likely.”
Contingencies will be discussed further in the chapter on liabilities in the next intermediate
accounting course.
A guarantee is a type of contingent liability because it is a promise to take responsibility
for another company’s financial obligation if that company is unable to do so. An example
might be a parent company that guarantees part or all of a bond issuance to investors
by its subsidiary company. Guarantees are not recognized and recorded because they
are not probable, so they are to be disclosed in the notes. This will enable investors and
creditors to assess the potential impact of the guarantee and the risk associated with it.

Subsequent Events
There is a period of time after the year-end date when economic events apparent in the
new year may need to be either reported in the financial statements for the year just ended
or disclosed in the notes prior to their release.
If this subsequent event is significant and relates to business operations prior to the
reporting date, it is to be included in the financial statements prior to release. These
would include adjusting entries such as inventory write-downs due to shrinkage, recording
additional accounts payable for late arriving invoices from suppliers or correction of errors
or omissions found when reconciling the general ledger accounts as part of the year-end
process.
If a subsequent event is significant but relates to operations occurring after the reporting
period, it is to be included in the notes. An example might be where early in the new
fiscal year, there is a flood causing serious damage to buildings and equipment, if the
repair or replacement costs are significant and perhaps uninsured, these costs, though
correctly paid and recorded in the new year, are to be disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements for the year-end just ended. This will ensure that the company stakeholders
will be aware of all the information about risks that could detrimentally affect company
operations.

4.3. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF)

97

4.3 Statement of Cash Flows (SCF)
The last core final financial statement to discuss is the statement of cash flows. The
purpose of this statement is to provide a means to assess the enterprise’s capacity to
generate cash and to enable stakeholders to compare cash flows of different entities
(CPA Canada, 2016). This statement is an integral part of the financial statements for
two reasons. First, this statement helps readers to understand where these cash flows
in (out) originated during the current year, to assess a company’s liquidity, solvency, and
financial flexibility. Second, these historic cash flows in (out) can be used to predict future
company performance.
The statement of cash flows can be prepared using two methods: the direct method and
the indirect method. Both methods organize cash flows into three activities: operating,
investing, and financing activities. The direct method reports cash flows from operating
activities into categories such as cash from customers, cash to suppliers, and cash to
employees. The indirect method reports cash flows from operating activities starting
with net income/loss adjusted for any non-cash items, followed by the changes in each
of the working capital accounts (i.e., current assets and current liabilities accounts). The
total cash flows from the operating activities are the same for both methods. The investing
and financing activities are prepared the same way under both methods.
This course will explain how to prepare the statement of cash flows using the indirect
method. The direct method will be discussed in a subsequent intermediate accounting
course.
Below is a statement of cash flows that illustrates the overall format and its connections
with the income statement and SFP/BS.

Note that interest and dividends paid can also be reported in the operating activities
section.
For the indirect method, the sum of the non-cash adjustments and changes to current
assets and liabilities represents the total cash flow in (out) from operating activities. Any
non-cash transactions relating to the investing or financing activities are excluded from
the SCF but are disclosed in the notes. An example would be an exchange of property,
plant, or equipment for common shares or a long-term note payable. The final section
of the statement reconciles the net change from the three sections with the opening and
closing cash and cash equivalents balances.

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

The statement of cash flows can be challenging to prepare. This is because preparing
the entries requires analyses of the accounts as well as an understanding of the types of
transactions that affect each account. Preparing a statement of cash flows is made much
easier if specific steps in a sequence are followed. Below is a summary of those steps.
1. Complete the statement headings.
2. Record the net income/loss in the operating activities section.
3. Adjust for any non-cash line items reported in the income statement to restate net
income/loss from an accrual to a cash basis (i.e., depreciation expense, amortization expense and any non-cash gains or losses).
4. Record the description and change amount as cash inflows or outflows for each
current asset and current liability (working capital accounts) except for the “current portion of long-term debt” line item, since it is not a working capital account.
Subtotal the operating activities section.
5. In the investment activities section, using T-accounts or other techniques, determine
the change for each non-current (long-term) asset account. Analyze and determine the reasons for the change. Record a description and the change amount(s)
as cash inflows or outflows.
6. In the financing activities section, add back to long-term debt any current portion
identified in the SFP/BS for both years, if any. Using T-accounts or other techniques,
determine the change for each non-current liability and equity account. Analyze
and determine the reason for the change(s). Record a description and the change
amount(s) as cash inflows or outflows.
7. Subtotal the three sections and record as the net change in cash. Record the
opening and closing cash and cash equivalents balances. Sum the opening
balance, the new change in cash subtotal, and the closing balance. This should to
reconcile with the ending cash and cash equivalent balances from the SFP/BS.
8. Complete any required disclosures.
To summarize the steps above into a few key words and phrases to remember:

Enter the amount of the net income/(loss) as the first amount in the operating activities section. Next, review the income statement and select the non-cash items. Look
for items such as depreciation, depletion, amortization, and gain/loss on sale/disposal
of assets. In this case, there are two non-cash items to adjust. Record them as
adjustments to net income in the statement of cash flows.
4. Current assets and liabilities:
Calculate and record the change for each current asset and current liability (except
the current portion of long-term notes payable, which is to be included with its

Accounting Equation:
A = L + E MUST ALWAYS BALANCE!
77,000 Assets = Liabilities + Equity
43,000
(5,000)

Cash + (all other) Assets = Liabilities + Equity

(2,000)
(84,510)
3,550 Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
(58,970)
(3,450)
143,000 Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
(8,400)
(5,880)
(200,000) Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
(101,660)

Cash inflows are reported as positive numbers, while cash outflows are reported
as negative numbers. To determine if the amount is a positive or negative number,
a simple method is to use the accounting equation to determine whether cash is
increasing as a positive number or decreasing as a negative number.
Recall that the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity, must always remain in balance. This concept can be applied when analyzing the various accounts
and recording the changes. For example, accounts receivable has increased from
$165,000 to $249,510 for a total change of $84,510. Using the accounting equation,
this can be expressed as:
Expanding the A = L + E equation a bit:
Cash + accounts receivable + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity
If accounts receivable increases by $84,510, this can be expressed as a black uparrow above the account in the equation:
Cash + accounts receivable + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity
If accounts receivable increases, its effect on the cash account must be a corresponding decrease to keep the equation balanced:

106

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

Cash + accounts receivable + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity
If cash decreases, it is a cash outflow, and the number must be negative (bracketed)
as shown in the statement above.
The same technique can be used when analyzing liability or equity accounts. For example, an increase in account payable (liability) of $143,000 will affect the equation
as follows:
Cash + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity
If accounts payable increases, cash must also increase by a corresponding amount
in order to keep the equation in balance.
Cash + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity
If cash increases, it is a cash inflow and the number must be positive (no brackets)
as shown in the statement above.
5. Non-current asset changes:
The next section is the investing activities section. The analysis of all the noncurrent asset accounts must also take into account whether there have been any
current year purchases or disposals/sales (or both) as part of the analysis. The use
of T-accounts for this type of analysis provides a useful visual tool to help understand
the changes that occurred in the account.

There are four non-current asset accounts: long-term investments, land, buildings,
and intangible assets. The land account had no change so there were no purchases
or sales of land. Analyzing the investment account results in the following cash
flows:

4.3. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF)

Since the additional information presented above stated that there were no sales of long-term
investments during the year, the entry would have been for a purchase:

Cash paid for the investment was therefore $30,750.

Analysis of the buildings account is a bit more complex because of the effects of the
contra account for accumulated depreciation. In this case, the building account and
its contra account must be merged since the SFP/BS reports only the net carrying
amount. Analyzing the buildings account results in the following cash flows:
Building (net of accum. depr.)

There are five long-term liability and equity accounts: long-term notes payable,
preferred shares, common shares, contributed surplus, and retained earnings. The
preferred shares and contributed surplus accounts had no changes to report. Analyzing the long-term note payable account results in the following cash flows:
Long-term note payable

Note how the current portion of long-term debt has been included in the analysis of
the long-term note payable. The current portion line item is a reporting requirement
regarding the principal amount owing one year after the reporting date, but it is not
actually a working capital account, so it is omitted from the operating section and
included with its corresponding long-term liability account in the financing activities
section as shown above.
The common shares and retained earnings accounts are straightforward and the
analysis of each are shown below.

7. Subtotal and reconcile:
The three activities total a net increase in cash of $57,500. When added to the
opening cash balance of $250,000, the resulting total of $307,500 is equal to the
ending cash balance, December 31, 2015 in the SFP/BS. This can be seen in the
completed statement below.

4.3.2 Disclosure Requirements
Step 8 involves the identification and preparation of disclosures.

110

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

8. Required disclosures:
The statement of cash flows must disclose cash flows associated with interest paid
and received, dividends paid and received, and income taxes paid, as well as any
non-cash transactions that occurred in the current year. These can be disclosed
in the notes or at the bottom of the statement, if not too lengthy. The cash received for dividend income and interest income was taken directly from the income
statement since no accrual accounts exist on the SFP/BS for these items. Cash
paid for interest charges and income taxes are calculated based on an analysis of
their respective liability accounts from the SFP/BS and expense accounts from the
income statement.
Following is the completed statement of cash flows, including disclosures, for Watson Ltd., for the year ended December 31, 2015:

4.3.3 Interpreting the Statement of Cash Flows
The cash balance shows an increase of $57,500 from the previous year. Without looking
deeper into the reasons why, a hasty conclusion could be drawn that all is well with
Watson Ltd. However, there is trouble ahead for this company. For example, the operating
activities section, which represents the reason for being in business, is in a negative cash
flow position. The profit that a company earns is expected to result in positive cash flows,
and this positive cash flow should be reflected in the operating activities section. In this
case, it does not, since there is a negative cash flow of $101,660 from operating activities.
Why?
For Watson, both the accounts receivable and inventory have increased, resulting in a net
decrease in cash of $143,480. An increase in accounts receivable may mean that sales
have occurred, but the collections are not keeping pace with the sales on account. An
increase in inventory may be because there have not been enough sales in the current
year to cycle the inventory from a current asset to sales/profit and ultimately into cash.
The risk of holding large amounts of inventory is the increased possibility that inventory
will become obsolete or damaged and unsellable.
In this case, an additional reason for decreased net cash from operating activities is due
to a decrease in unearned revenue. This is an interesting issue that needs to be explained
more fully. Recall that unearned revenue is cash received from customers in advance of
earning the revenue. In this case, the cash would have been reported as a positive cash
flow in the operating activities section in the previous reporting period when the cash was
actually received. At that time, the cash generated from operating activities would have
increased by the amount of the cash received for the unearned revenue. The entry upon
receipt of the cash would have been:

When the company provides the goods and services to the customer, the net income

112

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

reported at the top of the operating section will reflect that portion of the unearned revenue
that is now earned. However, it did not obtain actual cash for this revenue in this reporting
period because the cash was already received in the prior reporting period. Keep in
mind that unearned revenue is not normally an obligation that must be paid in cash to
the customer. Once the goods and services are provided to the customer, the obligation
ceases.
Looking at the investing activities, there was a sale of a building and a purchase of a
long-term investment. The sales proceeds from the building may have been partially
invested in the investment to make a return on the cash proceeds until it can be used for
its intended purpose in the future. Again, more analysis is necessary to confirm whether
this is the case. The sale of the patent also generated a positive cash flow. There was
no gain on sale of the patent reported in the income statement, so the sales proceeds did
not exceed its carrying value at the time it was sold. Hopefully, the patent sale was not
the result of a panic sale to raise additional cash.
Looking at the financing activities the majority of cash inflows for this reporting period
resulted from the issuance of additional common shares of $182,200. This represents an
increase in the share capital of greater than 25%. Increased shares will have a negative
impact on the earnings per share and possibly its market price as well, which may send
warning signals to investors. The shareholders were also paid dividends of $42,590, but
this amount only barely covers the preferred shareholders dividend of $30,000 (15,000 ×
$2) plus its share of the participating dividend. This leaves very little dividend left over for
the common shareholders. At some point, the common shareholders will likely become
concerned with receiving so little in dividends, along with the dilution of their shareholdings
due to the large issuance of additional shares.
When looking at the opening and closing cash balances for Watson, these seem like
sizeable balances, but what matters is where the cash came from and whether those
sources are sustainable. The $250,000 opening balance was almost entirely due to
the $225,000 unearned revenue received in advance, but this is likely not a sustainable
source. The ending cash balance of $307,500 is due to the issuance of additional share
capital of $182,200 (possibly a one-time transaction) and an increase in accounts payable
of $143,000 that must be paid soon. Consider that during the year, the cash from the
unearned revenues was being consumed and the issuance of the additional capital had
not yet occurred. It would be no surprise, if cash at the mid-year point was insufficient to
cover even the short-term liabilities, hence the increase in accounts payable and ultimately
the issuance of additional capital shares.
Watson is currently unable to generate positive cash flows from its operating activities.
The unearned revenue of $225,000 at the start of the year added some needed cash
early on, but this reserve was depleted by the end of the reporting year. In the meantime,
without a significant change in how the company manages its inventory and receivables,
Watson may continue to experience a shortage of cash from its operating activities. To
compensate, it may continue to sell off assets, issue more shares, or incur more long-

4.4. Analysis

113

term debt to obtain needed cash. In any case, these sources will dry up eventually when
investors are no longer willing to invest, creditors are no longer willing to loan cash, and no
assets worth selling remain. This current negative cash position from operating activities
for Watson Ltd. is unsustainable and must be turned around quickly for the company to
remain a going concern.
Not all companies who report profits are financially stable. This is because profits do not
translate on a one-to-one basis with cash. Watson reported a $77,000 net income (profit),
but it is currently experiencing significant negative cash flows from its operating activities.
If sufficient cash is generated from operating activities, the company will not have to
increase its debt, issue shares, or sell off useful assets to pay their bills. For Watson
Ltd., it increased its short-term debt (accounts payable), sold off a building, and issued
25% more common shares.
Perhaps Watson’s negative cash flow from operating activities will turn itself around in
the next reporting period. This would be the company’s best hope. For other companies
who experience positive cash flows from operations, they must also ensure that this is
sustainable and can be repeated consistently in the future.

4.4 Analysis
Statement of Financial Position/Balance Sheet (SFP/BS)
The SFP/BS is made up of many line items, comprised of many general ledger accounts, using different measurement bases (historical cost, fair value, and other valuation
methods previously discussed in this chapter), and with significant adjusting entries for
accruals and application of the company’s accounting policies. For this reason, the
SFP/BS does not present a clear-cut, definitive report of a company’s exact financial
state. Its purpose is to provide an overview as a starting point for further analysis. Some
types of analysis typically undertaken by management are discussed below.
Comparative SFP/BS
Arranging previous reporting data beside the current data is a useful tool with which to
analyze trends. Some companies also include the percentage change for each line item
to allow certain changes in amounts to become highly visible. This enables analysts
to narrow down possible areas of poor performance where further investigation will be
undertaken to determine the reasons why.
Ratio Analyses

114

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

Ratio analysis is simply where relationships between selected financial data (presented in
the numerator and denominator of the formula) provide key information about a company.
Ratios from current year financial statements may be more useful when they are used
to compare with benchmark ratios. Examples of benchmark ratios are ratios from other
companies, ratios from the industry sector the company operates in, or historical and
future ratio targets set by management as part of the company’s strategic plan.
Care must be taken when interpreting ratios, because companies within an industry
sector may use different accounting policies that will affect the comparison of ratios. In
the end, ratios are based on current and past performance and are merely indicators.
Further investigation is needed to gather more business intelligence about the reasons
why certain variances are occurring.
Below are some common ratios used to analyze the SFP/BS and SCF financial statements:

Many of the ratios identified above will be illustrated throughout the remaining chapters of
this course.
Note that ratios are not particularly meaningful without historical trends or industry standards. Some general benchmarks signifying a reasonably healthy financial state are:
Current ratio
Quick ratio
Days’ sales uncollected

2:1
1:1
1.3 times the credit policy in days

For example, if the credit policy were 30 days, a reasonable day’s sales uncollected ratio
would be 30 days × 1.3 = 39 days that a sale would remain uncollected.
Inventory turnover

5 times per year (or in days, every 365 ÷ 5 = 73 days

Again, it is important to understand that the general benchmarks identified above are
guidelines only. Industry standard ratios are superior in every way, if available, since ratios
are only as good as what they are being compared to (the benchmark). If the comparative
ratio is not accurate for that industry, the analysis will be meaningless. (This is often
referred to as “garbage in; garbage out.”) As a result, management can make incorrect
decisions on that basis, seriously impairing a company’s potential future performance and
sustainability.

Cash Flow Ratio
It is critical to monitor the trends regarding cash flows over time. If trends are tracked, ratio
analyses can be a powerful tool to evaluate a company’s cash flows. Below are some of
the cash flow ratios currently used in business:

Liquidity ratios – ability to pay short term obligations:

Financial flexibility – ability to react to unexpected expenses and investment opportunities:

(statement of cash flows)

Free Cash Flow Analyses
Free cash flow is the remaining cash flow from the operating activities section after
deducting cash spent on capital expenditures such as purchasing property, plant, and
equipment. Some companies also deduct cash paid dividends. The remaining cash flow
represents cash available to do other things, such as expand operations, pay off long-term
debt, or reduce the number of outstanding shares. Below is the calculation using the data
from Watson Ltd. statement of cash flows:

It is no surprise that Watson has no free cash flow and no financial flexibility, since its
operating activities are in a negative position. Note that the dividend deduction in the
free cash flow calculation is optional, since dividends can be waived at management’s
discretion. In Watson’s case, it met its current year dividend cash requirements by selling
more common shares to raise additional cash. The capital expenditures should be for
those relating to daily operations that are intended to sustain ongoing operations. For this
reason, capital expenditures purchased as investments are usually excluded from the free
cash flow analysis.

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe the statement of financial position/balance sheet
(SFP/BS) and the statement of cash flows (SCF), and explain their
role in accounting and business.
The statement of financial position (IFRS) also known as the balance sheet (ASPE)
reports on what resources the company has (assets) at a specific point in time and what
claims to those resources exist (liabilities and equity). The statement provides a way
to assess a company’s liquidity and solvency – both together creating a picture of the
company’s financial flexibility. The structure of the SFP/BS follows the basic accounting
equation: A = L + E, where assets are presented first, followed by liabilities and equity,
which together equal the total assets. Key issues are the recognition and valuation used
for each account reported.
The statement of cash flows reports on how the company obtains and utilizes its cash
flows and reconciles with the cash balance reported in the SFP/BS. It is separated into
operating, investing, and financing activities. The combination of positive and negative
cash flows from each activity can provide important information about how the company
manages its cash flows.

LO 2: Explain the purpose of the SFP/BS and prepare a SFP/BS in
good form.
The classified SFP/BS separates the assets and liabilities into current and non-current
(long-term) subsections based on meeting certain criteria. The statement has many
disclosure requirements that ensure it is faithfully representative, that the business continues as a going concern, and that revenue and expenses are grouped into appropriate
classifications that meet the standards for disclosure. Some of the more common required
disclosures are listed, including the measurement basis of each account, such as cost,
net realizable value, fair value, and so on. The acceptable options regarding how to
present the required disclosures include using parentheses in the body of the statement
or disclosing in the notes to the financial statements.
Several factors influence what is reported in the SFP/BS. Included are changes in accounting estimates that are applied prospectively and changes due to errors or omissions
or accounting policy that are applied retroactively with restatement. Descriptions of these
are to be included in the notes with detailed explanations. Other factors that can affect
the SFP/BS are provisions, contingencies and guarantees that may need to be recognized
within the statement or disclosed in the notes. Certain subsequent events will also affect

Chapter Summary

123

what is reported in the SFP/BS.

LO 3: Explain the purpose of the statement of cash flows and
prepare a SCF in good form.
The statement of cash flows (SCF) provides the means to assess the business’s capacity
to generate cash and to determine where the cash flows come from. The statement
combines with the SFP/BS to evaluate a company’s liquidity and solvency; when combined, these represent a company’s financial flexibility. This information can be used
to predict the future financial position and cash flows of the company based on past
events. The SCF can be prepared using either the direct or indirect method. Regarding
the indirect method, the statement is presented in three distinct sections, which follow the
basic structure of the balance sheet classifications: operating activities (current assets,
and current liabilities), investing activities (non-current assets), and financing activities
(long-term debt and equity). The changes between the opening and closing balances of
the SFP/BS accounts are reported in the SCF as either cash inflows or cash outflows.
The three sections net to a single net cash change amount that, when combined with the
cash and cash equivalent opening balances, results in the same amount as the ending
balances reported in the SFP/BS.
An important section in the SCF is the operating activities section because it reports the
cash flows resulting from daily operations which is the reason why the company is in
business. If cash flows are negative in this section, management must determine if this
is due to a temporary condition or if fundamental changes are needed to better manage
activities such as the collections of accounts receivables or levels of unsold inventory. If a
company is in a negative cash flow position from operating activities, it will usually either
increase its debt by borrowing, increase its equity by issuing more shares, or sell off some
of its assets. If these activities are undertaken, they will be detected as cash inflows from
either the investing or financing sections. None of these three options are ideal and can
be done in the short run, but they cannot be sustained in the long run. Even positive cash
flows from operating activities must be evaluated to determine if they are sustainable and
will continue into the future.

LO 4: Identify and describe the types of analysis techniques that can
be used for the statement of financial position/balance sheet and the
statement of cash flows.
Several analytical techniques can be applied when reviewing the SFP/BS. For example,
comparative years’ data can be presented to help identify trends. Using a percentage
for each line item will help highlight items that may possess unusual characteristics for

124

Financial Reports – Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows

further analysis. Ratio analysis is the most often used technique but is of limited value if
no benchmarks such as historical ratios or industry standards exist. Ratios typically focus
on an aspect of a company such as liquidity, profitability, effectiveness of assets used,
and ability to service short- and long-term debts. Care must be taken when interpreting
the results of ratio analysis, and management must be aware that differences in ratios
from competitors’ financial statements can result from changes in accounting policies or
the application of different accounting estimates and methods.
Another technique called free cash flow analysis calculates the remaining cash flow from
the operating activities section after deducting cash spent on capital expenditures such as
purchasing property, plant, and equipment. Some companies also deduct cash paid as
dividends. The cash flow remaining is available to use for expansion, repayment of longterm debt, or down-sizing shareholdings to improve the share price, reduce the amount
of dividends to pay, and to attract investors.

Revenue

Trouble at Tesco
On November 9, 2014, it was reported that several legal firms were considering
launching a class action suit against British grocery giant Tesco PLC. The claims were
related to revelations made by the company in September that its profits for the first
half of the year were overstated by £263 million. In October, the United Kingdom’s
Serious Fraud Office announced that it was launching its own investigation into the
accounting practices at Tesco. This followed the company’s suspension of eight senior
executives along with the resignation of the CEO.
The issue at Tesco stemmed primarily from a misstatement of a revenue category
described as “commercial income.” Although the company’s primary business is
selling groceries to consumers, it also earns a significant amount from suppliers.
Manufacturers and suppliers understand that in a grocery store, the location of the
product on the shelves can have a significant effect on the level of sales generated.
Many of these suppliers will offer rebates or other payments to Tesco in exchange for
preferential placement of their products on the shelves. These rebates will often be
calculated on a sliding scale, increasing as the level of sales increases.
In Tesco’s interim financial statements, many of these rebates would need to be
estimated, as the sales level for the entire year would not yet be known. Tesco’s
auditor, PwC, indicated in its 2014 audit report that the determination of commercial
income was an area of audit risk due to the judgment required and possibility of
manipulation. Tesco had been experiencing decreasing market share in 2014, and
this may have provided an incentive for some degree of earnings management. Some
analysts suggested that Tesco might have booked promotional rebates based on
historic results rather than current activity.
Problems with revenue recognition have been a source of many accounting errors
and frauds over the years. Given the complex nature of some types of business
transactions and contracts, the criteria for recognition of revenue may not always
be clear. When significant levels of judgment are required to determine the point at
which revenue should be recognized, the opportunity for misstatement grows. Given
that many of the complex issues surrounding revenue recognition are not always well
understood by financial-statement readers, managers may sometimes give in to the
temptation to “work” the numbers a little bit.
This chapter will explore some of the issues and judgments required with respect to

Introduction
Revenue is the essence of any business. Without revenue, a business cannot exist.
The basic concept of revenue is well understood by business people, but complex and
important accounting issues complicate the recognition and reporting of revenue. Sometimes, the complexity of these issues can lead to erroneous or inappropriate recognition of
revenue. In 2007, Nortel Networks Corporation paid a $35 million settlement in response
to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into its reporting practices.
Although several problems were identified, one of the specific issues that the SEC investigated was Nortel’s earlier accounting for bill-and-hold transactions. In a separate matter,
Nortel was also required to restate its financial statements due to errors in the timing of

revenue recognition for bundled sales contracts. In this chapter, we will examine these
issues and determine the appropriate accounting treatment for revenues.

Revenue

5.1 Definition
IFRS 15 defines revenue as “participants income arising in the course of an entity’s
ordinary activities.” Income is defined as “increases in economic benefits during the
accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of
liabilities that result in an increase in equity, other than those relating to contributions
from equity participants.” (CPA Canada, 2017, IFRS 15 Appendix A).
ASPE defines revenue as “the inflow of cash, receivables or other consideration arising
in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise, normally from the sale of goods,
the rendering of services, and the use by others of enterprise resources yielding interest,
royalties and dividends” (CPA Canada, 2017, 3400.03a).
Both definitions refer to the ordinary activities of the entity, which suggests that gains
made from incidental activities, such as the sale of surplus assets, cannot be defined as
revenue. However, these gains are still considered income, as the Conceptual Framework
includes revenue and gains as part of its definition of income. Revenue is realized when
goods or services are converted to cash. The point when cash is realized is usually easy
to identify. In a grocery store, when a customer pays for his or her purchase with cash,
the revenue is realized at that moment. In a wholesale business, when goods are sold
on credit, the revenue is not realized until the account receivable is collected and cash is
deposited in the bank. However, in this case, the revenue would have been recognized
at some earlier point when the account receivable was created. In accounting, the point
at which revenue should be recognized is not always so simple to determine.

5.2 Revenue Recognition
There are two different perspectives on how to recognize revenues:

• The contract-based approach
• The earnings approach

The contract-based approach is the subject of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. This standard focuses on the contractual rights and obligations of the buyer
and the seller. The earnings approach is currently used in ASPE. This approach focuses
on the process of adding value to the final product or service that is delivered to the
customer, and will be discussed in Section 5.5.

5.2. Revenue Recognition

143

IFRS 15, issued in 2014, is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1,
2018, although early adoption is allowed. The length of this transition period reflects the
anticipated effect this standard may have on business results and business processes.
This standard was a joint project between IASB and FASB, as both standard-setting bodies were interested in creating more consistency in the application of revenue-recognition
principles. The nature and complexity of this standard and the resulting process meant
that development time was lengthy. The project was first added to the IASB agenda in
2002, and the first discussion paper was produced in 2008.
The standard applies to all contractual relationships with customers except for leases,
financial instruments, insurance contracts, and those transactions covered by standards
that deal with subsidiaries, joint arrangements, joint ventures, and associates. The standard also doesn’t apply to non-monetary exchanges between entities in the same line
of business to facilitate sales to customers or potential customers. The new standard
replaces several existing standards, including IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRIC 13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC
18, and SIC-31.
The standard takes the approach that the essence of the relationship between a business,
and its customers can be characterized as one of contractual rights and obligations. To
determine the correct accounting treatment for these transactions, the standard applies a
five-step model:

1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
3. Determine the transaction price.
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The standard provides a significant amount of detail in the application of these steps. We
will focus on some of the key elements of each component of the model.

5.2.1 Identify the Contract
The contract must be approved by both parties and must clearly identify both the goods
and services that will be transferred and the price to be paid for these goods and services. The contract must be one of commercial substance, and there must be reasonable
expectation that the ultimate amount owing from the customer will be collected. This
collectability criterion will prevent a situation where revenue is recognized and then a

144

Revenue

provision is immediately made for an uncollectible account. Under this criterion, the
contract cannot be recognized until the collection is probable. If these conditions are
not present, the contract can be continually reassessed to see if its status changes. The
standard also applies guidance on how to deal with contract modifications. Depending
on the circumstances, the modifications may be treated as either a change to the existing
contract or as a completely new contract. A new contract would exist if the scope of the
contract increases due to the addition of distinct goods or services, and the price of the
contract increases by an amount that reflects the entity’s stand-alone selling prices of the
additional goods or services.
The contract will not exist if each party to the contract has the unilateral, enforceable
right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party. A
contract would be considered wholly unperformed if the entity has not yet transferred any
of the promised goods or services to the customer, and the entity has not received any
consideration or entitlement to consideration. In this situation, there is clearly no revenue
to recognize as there has not been any exchange under the contract.

5.2.2 Identify the Performance Obligations
This is a critical step, as the performance obligations will determine when revenue is
recognized. The standard requires that the promised performance obligation be identified
either as distinct goods and services or as a series of distinct goods and services that
are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. A
performance obligation exists only if there is a transfer of goods or services to a customer.
This limitation in the definition means that internal administrative tasks required to manage
a contract are not, in themselves, performance obligations.
During the development and implementation of IFRS 15, there was a great deal of discussion around the concept of distinct goods or services. The definition of “distinct” in this
context contains two criteria: the customer can benefit from the good or service either on
its own or together with other resources that are already available to the customer, and
the contract contains a separately identifiable promise to transfer the good or service. It
is important to note that both of these criteria must be satisfied to meet the definition of
“distinct.” For some contracts, the satisfaction of the second criteria may require some
analysis. The standard provides further clarification by specifying the following indicators
of a combined good or service (i.e., a single performance obligation):

• Significant services in integrating the goods or services with other goods or services
are provided in the contract.
• The goods or services provided significantly modify or customize other goods or
services provided in the contract.

5.2. Revenue Recognition

145

• The goods or services are highly interdependent.

The standard provides further detailed examples to illustrate these concepts. A common,
simple example can also illustrate the idea of “distinct”. Consider a customer who wishes
to build a brick wall. There are two ways this could be done. The customer could arrange
with a local building supply warehouse to deliver all the required materials (bricks, mortar,
tools, etc.) The company could then arrange a separate contract with a local mason
to build the wall. In this case, there are two separate contracts. In the first contract,
the performance obligation is satisfied when the materials are delivered to the building
site. The performance obligation in the second contract will be satisfied when the mason
completes construction of the wall.
Now consider a different scenario: the company hires a local contractor to build the wall.
The contractor purchases all the materials and arranges to have them delivered to the
building site. Although these materials could meet the first criteria (i.e., the customer could
benefit from them), the second criteria is not met. The contractor has made a promise for
a single good: the completed wall. The contractor is going to provide significant services
in integrating the goods (assembling the bricks with the mortar), the service modifies the
goods, and the goods and services are interdependent (the skilled labour of the contractor
is required to assemble the raw materials). In this case, the delivery of the materials to
the building site does not satisfy a performance obligation. The performance obligation is
not satisfied until the wall is completed.
To provide further clarity on the nature of performance obligations, the standard provides
the following examples of goods and services:

• Sale of goods produced by the entity
• Resale of goods purchased by the entity
• Resale of rights to goods or services purchased by the entity
• Performing a contractually agreed upon task
• Providing a service of standing ready to provide goods or services
• Providing a service of arranging for another party the transfer of goods or services
• Granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future that the customer
can resell
• Constructing, manufacturing, or developing an asset on behalf of a customer
• Granting licenses
• Granting options to purchase additional goods or services

146

Revenue

(CPA Handbook – Accounting, IFRS 15.26)
In some of the examples above, it is apparent that the entity would be acting as an agent
for the benefit of a principal. In determining whether an agency relationship exists, the
key factor to consider is control. If the entity controls the good or service before it is
transferred to the customer, then the entity is a principal. If the entity does not control
the good or service, the entity would be considered an agent. The main concern from an
accounting perspective in these situations is the amount of revenue to recognize. For a
principal, the gross amount of consideration expected from the transaction is considered
revenue. For an agent, only the fee or commission earned from the transfer of goods or
services is reported as revenue.

5.2.3 Determine the Transaction Price
The standard defines the transaction price as the amount of the consideration the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. This consideration may be fixed or variable
in nature. As well, there may be an implied financing component present in the consideration. Also, there are certain contracts that may require the payment of non-cash
consideration.
Variable consideration can occur when discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, or other incentives or penalties exist. When variable consideration is present
in a contract, the amount should be estimated using either the expected value (the sum
of probability-weighted amounts from a range of possible amounts) or the most likely
amount (usually more appropriate when the range contains only a few choices). Variable
consideration can be included in the transaction price only if it is highly probable that
a significant reversal in the amount cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in the
future. The standard does not define what is meant by “highly probable”, but it does
provide a list of factors to consider when making this assessment. These situations
require professional judgment and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative factors.
In some contracts, the entity may be providing significant financing services, even if these
are not explicitly stated in the contract. A simple example would be goods sold which
require payment in two years’ time. Although the contract may not state an interest rate,
there is clearly a financing component present. The selling entity needs to account for the
time value of money in determining the portion of the sale that relates to the goods and
the portion that relates to the financing provided. In determining if a significant financing
component exists, the entity should consider the difference between the consideration and
the cash selling price of the goods or services, the length of time between the transfer of
control and the customer’s payment, and prevailing interest rates in the relevant market.
The discount rate used should reflect the rate that would be arrived at if the entity and the
customer had engaged in a separate financing contract. This rate should reflect current

5.2. Revenue Recognition

147

market conditions, as well as the customer’s credit rating, collateral offered, and any
other relevant factors. As a practical expedient, the standard allows entities to ignore the
financing component if the time from delivery of goods or services to receipt of payment
is expected to be one year or less.
When a contract allows non-cash consideration to be paid by a customer, that consideration should be measured at its fair value. In some cases, it may not be possible to
determine the fair value of the consideration received. In these cases, the entity should
use the stand-alone selling prices of the promised goods or services to determine the
transaction price.

5.2.4 Allocate the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations
Where multiple performance obligations are included in a single-price contract, the price
should be allocated based on the relative proportions of the stand-alone selling prices
of each component at the contract inception date. Where the stand-alone selling prices
cannot be determined, other suitable estimation methods include
• the adjusted market assessment approach,
• the expected cost plus a margin approach, and
• the residual approach (permissible only in limited circumstances).
The application of these approaches may result in the identification of performance obligations that hadn’t previously been identified due to the lack of stand-alone prices. If
the customer receives a discount from purchasing a bundle of goods or services, this
discount would normally be allocated in a proportional manner to the different performance obligations. The standard does, however, allow for discounts to be allocated in a
disproportional manner if certain criteria are met. When variable consideration is present
in a contract, the standard allows the variable component to be allocated to specific
performance obligations if certain criteria are met. Otherwise, the variable consideration
would be allocated in a proportional manner, similar to other consideration.

5.2.5 Recognize Revenue When (or as) the Entity Satisfies a
Performance Obligation
Revenue should be recognized when the performance obligation has been satisfied. This
occurs when the entity has transferred control of an asset to the customer. In this context,
an asset includes either goods or services. A service is considered an asset because the

148

Revenue

customer obtains a benefit from its use, even if only briefly. The performance obligations
can be satisfied either at a point in time or over time.
The standard defines control as the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially
all of the benefits from the asset. (CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting, IFRS 15.33).
Benefits are described as future cash flows, and can take the form of either inflows or
reductions of outflows. Thus, cash flows can include not only the revenue derived directly
from selling the asset, but also savings from using the asset to enhance other assets, or
even the settlement of liabilities with the asset.
Many common business transactions result in performance obligations being satisfied at a
point in time. This point could also be described as the critical event. For example, when
you buy groceries at your local convenience store, the critical event occurs when you
exchange cash for possession of the goods. Once you leave the store with the groceries,
revenue has been earned by the store. The proprietor no longer has any responsibility
for or control over the goods. Other factors that can be considered when determining if
control of an asset has been transferred include the transfer of legal title, the transfer of
physical possession, the acceptance by the customer of the asset, the entity’s entitlement
to payment by the customer, and the transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In the example of groceries purchased, the reward is the realization of the cash received
from the sale. Prior to the sale, the risk to the vendor is that the food products may pass
their sell-by date or may not be saleable due to changes in consumer tastes. Once you
have purchased the goods, you are accepting responsibility for consuming the product
prior to the sell-by date. Thus, the rewards have been transferred to the seller and the
risks have been transferred to the buyer.
Often, the question of control can be answered by looking at a number of the factors
identified above. As long as a company possesses the goods and still holds the title
to the goods, there is both a risk (i.e., goods could be damaged, stolen, or destroyed)
and a reward (i.e., goods can pledged or sold) available to the vendor. Sometimes, a
vendor may transfer legal title to the customer but still maintain physical possession of
the goods. In late 2000, Nortel Networks Corporation recorded approximately $1 billion of
revenue using bill-and-hold transactions. These transactions were recorded as sales, but
the company maintained possession of the goods until some later date when the customer
requested delivery. In order to promote these types of sales, the company offered several
different incentives to its customers. To report these types of transactions, US GAAP
required that several conditions be met, including the conditions that the transaction must
be requested by the customer and serve some legitimate business purpose. Nortel’s
actions violated these two conditions, and as such, the company was later required to
restate revenues for the fourth quarter by over $1 billion.
The selling of services can create further accounting problems, as there is no longer the
obvious transfer of a physical product to indicate completion of the earnings process.
When you get a haircut, the service will be completed when you are satisfied with the
cut and the barber enters the sale into the cash register. This can still be described as

5.2. Revenue Recognition

149

revenue earned at a point in time, as the completion of the haircut can be seen to be a
critical event. However, some activities can take longer to complete, and they can even
extend over several accounting periods. When a company agrees to provide a service
over a period of time that crosses several fiscal years, the problem is to determine in
which accounting periods to recognize the revenue. IFRS 15 requires one of three criteria
be met to recognize revenue over time:
• The customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as the entity performs;
• The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls;
or
• The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the
entity and entity has an enforceable right to payment
(CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting, IFRS 15.35)
When recognizing revenue for a performance obligation that is satisfied over time, it is
essential that the entity have a reliable method for measuring progress. These methods
should be based on either inputs or outputs. If the entity cannot reasonably measure its
progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation, then revenue should not be
recognized. In some cases, although reliable measures of progress are not available,
there is still a reasonable expectation that costs incurred will be recovered. In this instance, revenue would be recognized equal to the costs incurred. This is referred to as
the zero-margin method. Revenue recognition for long term contracts will be discussed
further in Section 5.3.6.
Accounting for revenue over time can create further problems when both goods and
services are delivered. For example, in 2006, Nortel Networks was required to restate
its financial statements due to improper accounting of several “multiple element arrangements.” Nortel was engaged in many different types of long-term contracts with customers
where installation, network planning, engineering, hardware, software, upgrades, and
customer-support features were all included in the contract price. The accounting for
these contracts was complicated, and the restatement was required because certain
undelivered products and services were not considered separate accounting units, as
no fair value could be determined for them.

5.2.6 Contract Costs
IFRS 15 also provides guidance on how to account for costs incurred to obtain and fulfill a
contract. When obtaining a contract, any incremental costs incurred should be capitalized

150

Revenue

as an asset and amortized over the life of the contract. These costs only include those
direct costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. A
common example would be commissions paid to sales staff. As a practical expedient, the
standard allows the costs to be expensed immediately for contracts terms of one year or
less. This particular section of the standard has generated some debate, particularly
in the telecommunications sector. Common practice in this industry usually involves
expensing employee commissions at the time the contract is signed. Some industry
representatives have expressed concern that the requirement to capitalize contract costs,
along with other aspects of the standard, will result in significant changes and investments
in IT systems to properly track the information.
For costs incurred to fulfill a contract, the standard requires capitalization only if the costs
relate directly to the contract, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used
to satisfy the performance obligations, and the costs are expected to be recovered. These
conditions will generally prevent the capitalization of general and administrative costs
that are not explicitly chargeable under a contract or the cost of wasted resources that
are not reflected in the price of the contract. However, overhead costs such as project
management, supervision, insurance, and depreciation may be eligible for capitalization
if they relate directly to the contract.

5.3 Applications
IFRS 15 provides fourteen sections of application guidance which elaborate on certain
aspects of the standard as they relate to specific situations. As well, the standard provides
sixty-three illustrative examples for further clarity. In this section, we will examine some of
the examples and guidance.

5.3.1 Bundled Sales
Telurama Inc. sells mobile telephones with two-year bundled airtime and data plans. The
stand-alone selling price of the telephone is $600. The the airtime and data plan does not
have an observable stand-alone selling price, but Telurama has used the adjusted market
assessment approach to estimate the stand-alone selling price as $1,000. As the mobile
telephone business is very competitive, Telurama is required to sell the bundled package
for $1,400. Telurama has determined that the discount should be allocated proportionally
to the two performance obligations. In this case, the revenue would be recognized as
follows:

5.3. Applications

If the airtime and data plan was sold to different customer groups for a broad range of
different prices, Telurama could use the residual approach instead, as the stand-alone
selling price for this performance obligation would not be observable. With this approach,
the value of the observable stand-alone selling price (the telephone) is subtracted from
the total contract value to arrive at the value of the unobservable stand-alone selling price
(the airtime and data plan). In this example, Telurama would recognize revenue as follows:

In either case, revenue will be recorded based on the allocation calculated above. The
revenue for the telephone will be recorded immediately upon delivery to the customer,
and the remaining amount relating to the airtime and data will be reported as unearned
revenue that will be recognized over the term of the contract. The journal entry at the time
of sale to record this transaction using the first example would look like this:

5.3.2 Consignment Sales
Sometimes a retailer may not want to take the risk of purchasing a product for resale. The
retailer may not want to tie up working capital or may think the product is too speculative
or risky. In these cases, a consignment arrangement may be appropriate. Under this type
of arrangement, the manufacturer of the product (the consignor ) will ship the goods to
the retailer (the consignee), but the manufacturer will retain legal title to the product. The
consignee agrees to take care of the product and make efforts to the sell the product,
but no guarantee of performance is made. As well, the agreement will likely require the
return of the goods to the consignor after a specified period, if the goods are not sold.
Thus, the performance obligation has not been satisfied when the goods are transferred
to the consignee, and the consignor cannot recognize revenue at this point. The goods

152

Revenue

will, thus, remain on the consignor’s books as inventory until the consignee sells them.
When the consignee actually sells the product, an obligation is now created to reimburse
the consignor the amount of the sales proceeds, less any commissions and expenses that
are agreed to in the contract for the consignment arrangement. At the time of sale, the
consignor can recognize the revenue from the product, and the consignee can recognize
the commission revenue.
Assume the following facts: Dali Printmaking Inc. produces fine-art posters. Dali ships
3,000 posters to Magritte Merchandising Ltd. on a consignment basis. The total cost of
the posters is $12,000, and Dali pays $550 in shipping costs. Magritte pays $1,200 for
advertising costs that will be reimbursed by Dali. During the year, Magritte sells one-half
of the posters for $23,000. Magritte informs Dali of this and pays the amount owing.
Magritte’s commission is 15 percent of the sales price. The accounting for this type of
transaction looks like this:

5.3.3 Sales With Right of Return
It is a common practice in the retail sector to allow customers to return products for various
reasons, within a certain period of time. When the product is returned, the customer may
receive a full refund, a credit to be applied against future purchases, or a replacement
product. The accounting issue for the company is whether the full amount of revenue
should be recognized at the time of sale, given that a certain number of returns may be
expected. The general approach used here is to record revenue only in the amount of
consideration expected to be received. In other words, the company needs to make an
estimate at the time of sale of the amount of returns expected, and then exclude this
amount from reported revenue. This amount should be reported as a refund liability. As
well, the company should report an asset equal to the expected amount of product to be
returned. The asset would be adjusted against the cost of goods sold in the period of
sale. At the end of every accounting period, the estimates used to arrive at the refund
liability and asset should be reviewed and adjusted where necessary. It is expected that
most companies should be able to make reasonable estimates of these amounts, using
historical, industry, technical, or other data.
Consider the following example. Wyeth Mart sells high quality paintbrushes for use in fine
art applications. Each brush costs the company $15 and sells for $25. Wyeth Mart offers
a full refund for any unused product that is returned within 30 days of purchase, and the
company expects that these returned products can resold for a profit. The company has
reviewed historical sales data and estimated that 2% of products sold will be returned for
a refund. During the month of May, 1,000 paintbrushes are sold for cash. The journal
entries in May would be:

If the amount returned differs from estimated amount, the refund liability and refund asset
will need to be adjusted once the return period expires. This is an ongoing process, as
most companies will continue to make new sales during the period. As a practical matter,
many companies will only review the balances of the refund liability and refund asset
account at the annual reporting date.

5.3.4 Bill-and-Hold Arrangements
There are times when a customer may purchase goods from a company, but not take
physical possession of the goods until a later date. Customers may have legitimate reasons for doing this, including a lack of warehouse space, delays in their own productions
processes, or the need to secure a supply of a scarce product. When the selling entity is
considering whether to recognize revenue on these types of contracts, it needs to consider
if control of the goods has been transferred to the customer. Aside from the normal criteria
that are used to evaluate control, an additional three conditions must be satisfied in billand-hold transactions:
• The reason for the bill-and-hold transaction must be substantive;
• The product must be identified separately;
• The entity must not have the ability to use or resell the product to another customer.
(CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting, IFRS 15.B81)

5.3. Applications

155

Consider the following example. Koenig Ltd. processes rare-earth elements used in
certain technological applications. One of these elements forms a critical component
of a customer’s product. The customer has requested Koenig Ltd. set aside a one-year
supply of the element to ensure that its production process is not interrupted. The customer’s factory is in close proximity to Koenig’s warehouse, and transportation between
the two locations is easily facilitated. The customer agrees to pay for the entire one-year
supply, as well as a monthly rental fee to cover Koenig’s cost of storing the product in its
warehouse. The entire payment of $500,000, representing the cost of the element and
12 months of rent, is received on December 29, 2017. Koenig has separately identified
and segregated the product in its warehouse, and the contract with the customer specifies
that product cannot be sold to another customer. The fair value of the warehouse rental
service being provided is $800 per month.
In this case, the revenue from the sale of the product can be recognized on December
29, 2017 because the reason for the bill-and-hold transaction is substantive (the customer
requested it), the product has been identified separately, and the contract specifies that
the product cannot be resold. Assuming the transaction price has been determined using
the fair value of the product and rental service, revenue will be recognized as follows:
Revenue related to rental service ($800 × 12)=$9,600
Revenue related to product ($500,000 − $9,600)=$490,400

Thus, on December 29, 2017, Koenig will recognize revenue of $490,400 and report
unearned revenue of $9,600. The $9,600 will be recognized as revenue at the rate of $800
per month over the next year. If the holding period were longer than one year, Koenig
would also need to consider the presence of a financing component in the transaction
price.

5.3.5 Barter Transactions
When a customer and an entity agree that payment for goods or services can be made
using non-cash consideration, the non-cash consideration received should be reported at
its fair value. Assume that an oil-and-gas company wishes to trade a quantity of crude
oil for natural gas that is used to power the refinery where the oil is processed. The
natural gas will be consumed and will not be held in inventory. As these two products
have different uses for the company, this transaction has commercial substance. Assume
that the fair value of the natural gas received is $10,000, and the cost of the crude oil
traded is $7,000. The journal entry for this transaction would be as follows:

5.3.6 Long-Term Construction Contracts
Many large construction projects can take several years to complete. With these types of
projects, a significant amount of professional judgment is required to determine when to
recognize revenue. An obvious approach may be to simply wait until the completion of the
project before recognizing revenue. However, this approach would not properly reflect the
periodic activities of the business. Although contracts of this nature are usually complex,
they do usually establish the right of the contractor to bill for work that is completed
throughout the project and result in a transfer of control to the customer. Because the
contractor is adding economic value to the product, while at the same time establishing
a legal right to collect money for work performed, it is appropriate to recognize revenue
on a periodic basis throughout the life of the project. This method of recognizing revenue
and related costs is referred to as the percentage-of-completion method.
The most difficult part of applying this method is determining the proportion of revenue to
recognize at the end of each accounting period. Both inputs (labour, materials, etc.) and
outputs (square footage of a building completed, sections of a bridge, etc.) can be used,
but judgment must be applied to determine which approach results in the most accurate
measurement of progress on the project. One of the problems with output methods is
that the measure may not accurately represent the entity’s progress toward satisfying the
performance obligation. With input methods, the problem may be that the input measured
does not directly correlate to the transfer of control of goods or services to the customer.
A common approach that is used by many construction companies is called the costto-cost basis. This approach uses the dollar value of inputs as the measurement of
progress. More precisely, the proportion of costs incurred to date to the current estimate
of total project costs is multiplied by the total expected revenue on the project to determine
the amount of revenue to recognize. When this method is used, it is assumed that costs
incurred do correlate to the transfer of control of goods and services to the customer and
that these costs are a reasonable representation of the entity’s progress toward satisfying
the performance obligation. This approach is illustrated in more detail in the examples
below.
Example 1: Profitable Contract
Salty Dog Marine Services Ltd. commenced a $25 million contract on January 1, 2015,
to construct an ocean-going freighter. The company expects the project will take three

years to complete. The total estimated costs for the project are $20 million. Assume the
following data for the completion of this project:
Costs to date
Estimated costs to complete project
Progress billings during the year
Cash collected during the year

The amount of revenue and gross profit recognized on this contract would be calculated
as follows:

Note that the costs incurred in the year are simply the difference between the current
year’s costs to date and the previous year’s costs to date. The total amount of gross profit
recognized over the three-year contract is $4,900,000, which represents the difference
between the contract revenue of $25 million and the total project costs of $20.1 million. It
is not uncommon for the total project costs to differ from the original estimate. Adjustments
to estimated project costs are always captured in the current year only. It is assumed that
estimates are based on the best information at the time they are made, so it would be
inappropriate to adjust previously recognized profit.
The journal entries to record these transactions in 2015 would look like this:

Construction in progress is a balance sheet account that represents accumulated costs
to date on a project plus any recognized profit. Billings on construction is also a balance
sheet account; it represents total amounts billed to the customer. These two accounts
are normally presented on a net basis on the balance sheet, and may sometimes be
described as Contract Asset/Liability. If construction in progress exceeds billings on
construction, the net balance would be reported as recognized revenues in excess
of billings. This asset would be reported as either current or noncurrent, depending on
the length of the contract. If billings on construction exceeds construction in progress,
the net balance would be reported as billings in excess of recognized revenues. This
liability would also be either current or noncurrent. On the income statement, the company
would report the revenues and construction expenses, with the difference being reported
as gross profit.
In 2017, once the contract is completed, an additional journal entry is required to close
the billings on construction and construction in progress accounts:

Example 2: Unprofitable Contract
Although it would be ideal if contract costs could always be accurately estimated, most
often this is not the case. Unexpected difficulties can occur during the construction
process, or costs can rise due to uncontrollable economic factors. Whatever the reason, it
is quite likely that the actual total costs on the project will differ from the original estimates.
If costs rise during an accounting period, this situation is treated as a change in estimate,
as it is presumed that the original estimates were based on the best information available

5.3. Applications

159

at the time. A change in estimate is always applied on a prospective basis, which means
the current period is adjusted for the net effect of the change, and future periods will be
accounted for using the new information. There is no need to restate the prior periods
when there is a change in estimate. If the revised estimate of costs will still result in the
contract earning an overall profit, the only effect of increased cost estimates will be to
reverse any previously overaccrued profits into the current year. This may result in a loss
for the current year, but the project will still report a total profit over its lifespan.
Sometimes, however, cost estimates may increase so much that the total project becomes
unprofitable. That is, the total revised project costs may exceed the total revenue on the
project. This situation is referred to as an onerous contract, which results in a liability.
When the unavoidable costs of fulfilling a contract exceed the economic benefits to be
derived from the contract, a conservative approach should be applied, and the total
amount of the expected loss should be recorded in the current year. In determining
the unavoidable costs on the contract, the entity should consider the least costly option
available, even if this means cancelling the contract and paying a penalty. This treatment
is required because it is important to alert financial-statement readers of the potential total
loss, regardless of the stage of completion, so that they are not misled about the realizable
value of assets or income. Onerous contracts will be discussed in a later chapter.
To illustrate this situation, consider our Salty Dog example again, with one change. Assume that in 2016, due to a worldwide iron shortage, the expected costs to complete the
project rise from $8,050,000 to $18,000,000. However, in 2017, it turns out that the drastic
rise in iron prices was only temporary, and the final tally of costs at the end of the project
is $26,500,000. The profit on the project would be calculated as follows:
Costs to date (A)
Estimated costs to complete project
Total estimated project costs (B)
Percent complete (C = A ÷ B)
Total contract price (D)
Revenue to date (C × D)
Less previously recognized revenue

Note: The additional loss to recognize in 2016 represents the loss expected at this point on work not
yet completed (i.e., 60% × [25,000,000 − 30,000,000]). This additional loss gets reversed in 2017, because
there is no further work to complete once the project is finished. By recognizing this additional amount in
2016, the financial statements will show the total expected loss on the project at this point. In 2016, the
additional loss will be journalized by adding it to the total of the construction expenses account recognized.

160

Revenue

Notice that the total loss recognized over the life of the project is $1,500,000, which reconciles with the total project revenue of $25,000,000 minus total project costs of $26,500,000.
Other Considerations
There may be cases where input costs include the purchase of a single, significant asset.
The entity may be required to install the asset as part of the contract, but may not have
anything to do with the construction of the asset itself. In this case, the use input costs
may be a misleading way to measure progress toward satisfaction of the performance
obligation, as the entity does not contribute to the construction of the asset.
Consider the following example. Rohe Construction Ltd. signs a contract with a customer
to install a distillation tower in an oil refinery. Rohe Construction Ltd. purchases the distillation tower from a supplier for $3,000,000 and delivers it to the work site on November
20, 2017. At this time, the customer obtains control of the tower. The company estimates
that it will take six months to install the distillation tower, and that the total project costs,
excluding the tower, will be $1,200,000. The total value of the contract is $5,000,000.
The company has determined that using total input costs would be a misleading way to
represent its progress toward satisfying the performance obligation. Instead, it will recognize revenue from the distillation tower itself using the zero-margin method, and revenue
from the installation services using the percentage-of-completion method. Assume that by
December 31, 2017, the company has incurred $300,000 of costs, excluding the purchase
of the tower. Revenue would be recognized as follows:

Revenue
Cost of goods sold
Gross profit

Tower
Installation
3,000,000
500,000
3,000,000
300,000
0
200,000

Total
3,500,000
3,300,000
200,000

NOTE: Installation revenue is calculated as ($5,000,000 − $3,000,000) × ($300,000 ÷
$1,200,000)
Using this approach, the total profit recorded to date of $200,000 represents 25% of the
total expected project profit of $800,000 ($5,000,000 − $3,000,000 − $1,200,000). This
makes sense, as the company has incurred 25% of the total expected costs, excluding
the tower itself. The company doesn’t recognize profit from the tower itself, as the tower’s
delivery does not represent satisfaction of the company’s performance obligation to install
the tower.
The zero-margin method can also be applied in situations where it is difficult to measure
the outcome of a performance obligation. This could occur, for example, in the early
stages of a long-term construction contract where significant progress cannot yet be

5.4. Presentation and Disclosure

161

measured. If the entity believes that costs incurred will ultimately be recoverable under the
contract, then the zero-margin method can be applied, and the company will recognize
revenue equal to the costs incurred. Once the entity determines that progress is now
reliably measurable, it can then start applying the percentage-of-completion method.

5.4 Presentation and Disclosure
IFRS 15 requires the presentation of contract assets or liabilities on the balance sheet
once performance of the contract occurs. Contract assets or liabilities should be reported
separately from receivables under the contract. Receivables are defined as unconditional
rights to consideration. The standard allows for alternate terminology in describing the
contract asset/liability, as long is it is clearly distinguishable from the receivable.
The standard has fairly extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements for
contracts with customers. These requirements were designed to address a deficiency in
previous standards regarding the level of detail disclosed for revenue transactions. The
disclosures provide information about the contracts themselves, the judgments applied
in accounting for the contracts, and any assets recognized by creating or fulfilling the
contract. Some of the key disclosures include:
• Revenue and impairment losses from contracts with customers
• Sufficient disaggregation of revenue categories to depict how the nature, amount,
timing, and uncertainty of revenue amounts are affected by economic factors
• A reconciliation of opening and closing contract asset/liability balances, including an
explanation of how satisfaction of performance obligations relates to the timing of
customer payments
• A detailed description of performance obligations
• Details of transaction prices allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations
• Details of judgments applied in determining the performance obligations and the
allocation of transaction prices to those obligations
• Explanations of methods used to determine the timing of satisfaction of performance
obligations over time
• Details of methods, inputs, and assumptions used to determine and allocate transaction prices
• Details of assets recognized from costs to obtain or fulfill a contract
• The application of any practical expedient allowed under the standard

162

Revenue

5.5 The Earnings Approach
ASPE uses a different approach to revenue recognition. This approach, often referred to
as the earnings approach, focuses on how an entity adds value during the completion
of a business transaction. While IFRS focuses on the balance sheet (contract assets and
liabilities), ASPE focuses more on the processes the entity undertakes to earn revenue.
In this sense, it can be thought of as income statement approach to revenue.
With the earnings approach, revenue is recognized when four conditions are met:

• The seller has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer
• The seller maintains no continuing managerial involvement or control over the goods
• Reasonable assurance exists regarding the measurement of consideration to be
received and the extent to which goods can be returned
• Collection of the consideration is reasonably assured

(CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting, ASPE 3400.04 and .05)
Although conceptually this approach appears quite different from the IFRS five-step approach, the results will often be the same when applying the two methods to the same
circumstances. The transfer of risks and rewards of ownership under ASPE will often
coincide with the satisfaction of a performance obligation under IFRS. There are, however,
some situations where the results will be different under the two approaches.
One area where IFRS and ASPE differ is in the treatment of long term contracts. ASPE allows for either the percentage-of-completion method or the completed contract method
to be used. The choice between methods is based on the accountant’s professional
judgment as to which method better relates the revenue to the work accomplished. The
completed contract method would usually be used when a company is unable to make
reasonable estimates of progress or performance of the contract consists of a single
act. Under the completed contract method, no revenues or expenses are recognized
until the contract is completed. This means the income statement will not reveal any
information about the company’s progress on the contract, as all costs and billings will
simply be accumulated in balance sheet accounts. In the year the contract is completed,
all revenue and expenses are recognized. Although this method avoids the problem of
estimation error, it does not provide useful information in the interim periods before project
completion.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe the criteria for recognizing revenue and determine if
a company has earned revenue in a business transaction.
Under IFRS, revenue is recognized using a five-step process: 1) identify the contract,
2) identify the performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations, and 5) recognize revenue when a

164

Revenue

performance obligation is satisfied. Performance obligations must relate to distinct goods
or services. Performance obligations can be satisfied over time or at a point in time.
The amount of revenue to be recognized from a performance obligation will depend on
whether the entity is acting as a principal or an agent. Incremental costs incurred to obtain
or fulfill a contract should be capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract. For
long-term contracts, a rational method of recognizing revenue will need to be applied,
based on some method of measuring progress.

LO 2: Discuss the problem of measurement uncertainty and
alternative accounting treatments for these situations.
Measurement uncertainty can occur when the contract includes variable consideration, an
implied financing component, non-cash consideration, or a discount on a bundle of goods
and services. The accounting treatment will depend on the nature of the measurement
problem. Where sales are bundled, the consideration will normally be allocated based on
the relative stand-alone selling prices of each component. Variable consideration should
be measured at the expected value or most likely amount. Interest, even if not explicitly
stated in the contract, should be identified as a separate performance obligation, unless
the contract period is less than one year. Non-cash consideration should be reported at
its fair value.

LO 3: Prepare journal entries for a number of different types of sales
transactions.
For bundled sales, consideration should be allocated proportionally, based on the standalone selling price of each component. The residual value approach would only be
appropriate if the stand-alone selling price of a component was not determinable. For
consignment sales, inventory first needs to be reclassified. Revenue from consignment
sales should not be recorded until the consignee actually sells the goods to a third party.
Costs of the transaction also need to be recorded. For sales with a right of return, an
accrual of the estimated amount of the refund liability needs to be recorded, along with
an estimate of the amount of refund assets expected to be received from customers.
For bill-and-hold arrangements, revenue should only be recognized if control has been
transferred to the customer. Additional criteria will need to be evaluated in making this
determination. For non-monetary exchanges, revenue should be recorded based on the
fair value of the goods or services received.

Chapter Summary

165

LO 4: Apply revenue recognition concepts to the determination of
profit from long-term construction contracts.
For a long-term construction contract, profits should be recognized in some rational manner over the life of the project. To do this, reliable estimates of progress are required.
Input or output measures may be used. Many construction companies prefer to use the
cost-to-cost method, which measures progress in terms of the dollar value of inputs. If
progress cannot be reliably measured, then profits should be reported using the zeromargin method.

LO 5: Prepare journal entries for long-term construction contracts.
Costs are accumulated a construction-in-progress account. When profit is estimated at
the end of the year using the percentage-of-completion method, the revenue and related
expense will be recorded, with the net profit being added to the construction-in-progress
account. Also, journal entries will record billings to customers and collections of those
billings. At the end of the construction contract, the construction-in-progress account
will be zeroed out against the billings account. The terms “contract asset” and “contract
liability” may also be used in place of the construction-in-progress and billings accounts.

LO 6: Apply revenue recognition concepts to unprofitable long-term
construction contracts.
When a construction contract is predicted to be unprofitable, resulting in an onerous
contract, the entire projected loss on the contract needs to be recognized immediately.
Once the project is completed, this amount will be adjusted so that the actual amount of
the project loss is reported. This approach results in inconsistent amounts of profit being
reported in each year of the project, but the total profit will be correct over the life of the
project.

LO 7: Describe presentation and disclosure requirements for
revenue-related accounts.
Contract assets and liabilities should be presented separately from contract receivables
on the balance sheet. IFRS 15 contains detailed qualitative and quantitative disclosure
requirements, including disaggregation of revenue categories, descriptions and reconciliations of performance obligations, and discussions of methods and judgements applied
in determining revenue.

166

Revenue

LO 8: Discuss the earnings approach to revenue recognition, and
compare it to current IFRS requirements.
The earnings approach is used in ASPE and includes four criteria for revenue recognition:
1) the seller has transferred the risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, 2) the seller
does not maintain any continuing managerial involvement or control over the goods, 3)
there is reasonable assurance regarding measurement of the consideration to be received
and the amount of goods that may be returned, and 4) collection of consideration is
reasonable assured. In many instances, the earnings approach will arrive at similar results
as the contract based approach of IFRS 15. In some cases, however, the results may be
different. With long-term construction contracts, the earnings approach allows for the
completed contract method to be used if there is no reasonable way to estimate progress
or performance of the contract consists of a single act.

EXERCISE 5–8
On February 1, 2015, Sterling Structures Ltd. signed a $3.5 million contract to construct
an office and warehouse for a small wholesale company. The project was originally
expected to be completed in two years, but difficulties in hiring a sufficient pool of skilled
workers extended the completion date by an extra year. As well, significant increases in
the price of steel in the second year resulted in cost overruns on the project. Sterling
was able to negotiate a partial recovery of these costs, and the total contract value was
adjusted to $3.8 million in the second year. Additional information from the project is as

Cash and Receivables

Cash Overflows for Apple
In 2013, Apple advised their shareholders that it sold 34M iPhones, up 90% from the
same quarter last year, and up 150% from the year before. Along with the increased
sales came increased profits (almost double) and increased cash in the bank; about
US$ 9.9B in cash flow from operations for a total cash holding of about US$ 100B.
Until that point, Apple was reluctant to pay out dividends to its shareholders as most
high-tech companies need large amounts of cash to expand their existing markets and
for research and development costs to find new markets. In 2013, Tim Cook, CEO
of Apple Inc., convinced Apple’s board of directors that it was time to start paying out
some periodic cash dividends to its investors; US$ 3.05 per share. Dividend payouts,
along with some shares repurchases, totalled about US$ 7.8B paid to investors in the
third quarter of 2013. Since Apple is a multinational corporation operating globally,
some of this cash stockpile was in foreign funds. This strategy avoids paying the 35%
US tax on foreign earnings repatriation. In all, about two-thirds of its cash holdings
are in foreign currencies. Even though this cash is not available for dividends, this
does not seem to bother Apple, since the company seems to have more than enough
US cash for dividends payments and other return of capital. Even so, all this currency,
especially foreign currency, is creating a new problem.
At this rate of continued growth, many analysts are predicting a continued piling up of
foreign and US cash. The issue then becomes; what to do with all this cash, especially
the massive two-thirds portion of foreign cash? It has become a conundrum—to
manage all this cash, Apple has had to open about two hundred different bank
accounts across different banks to monitor and track cash locations and spending, as
well as to track and manage liquidity across the organization on a day-to-day basis.
The risk to their gigantic cash pile sitting in bank accounts is that it may be earning
simple interest instead of better rates from investing in higher yielding instruments
such as money market funds. For a cash-rich company such as Apple, a centralized
cash management system is crucial; it will provide information quickly and efficiently
so that Apple’s money managers can make critical (and timely) investment decisions.
Another benefit of a centralized cash repository is reduced risk of fraudulent access
to cash, since cash invested in money market funds and similar alternatives is less
accessible than cash sitting in a bank account, or many bank accounts as is the case
with Apple.

171

172

Cash and Receivables

In Apple’s case, a centralized cash treasury will add value by reducing the percentage
of idle cash through streamlining bank accounts and by allowing cash managers to
focus on ensuring the right levels of cash with the remainder invested in instruments
with better returns.
While some may consider too much cash in too many bank accounts to be an enviable
position, it is still a risk that could lead to cash opportunities lost or worse, cash leaking
away in inappropriate hands if left unexamined.

Introduction
As the opening story about Apple illustrates, actively managing cash and receivables has
important implications for businesses. The time frame required to convert receivables to
cash is a cycle that calls for regular monitoring. This chapter addresses how management
uses financial reporting to regularly assess both the credit-to-cash cycle and its overall
cash position in terms of liquidity (the availability of liquid assets to pay short-term
obligations as they come due) or solvency (the ability to meet all maturing obligations as
they come due). This chapter will focus on cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
and notes (loans) receivable. Each of these will be discussed in terms of their use in
business: their recognition, measurement, reporting, and analysis.

Cash and Receivables

6.1 Overview
Cash and receivables are financial assets. Specifically, cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and notes receivable are all considered to be financial assets because
they are either:
• Cash
• A contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset, from another entity
(such as accounts and notes receivable).
A financial asset derives its value because of a contractual right, or a claim for a
determinable amount. The physical paper that cash or receivables are printed on has
no value by itself. Their real value is based on what they represent. For example, financial
assets such as cash include foreign currencies because their value in Canadian dollars
is determinable by applying the current exchange rate. Receivables result from the sale
of goods and services on credit or through lendings, for which the amount has been fixed
or known (determinable) at the time of the transaction. In contrast, the cash value is not
known in advance for non-financial assets such as inventories and fixed assets because
their cash value will depend on future market conditions.
Cash and receivables are also monetary assets because they represent a claim to cash
where the amount is fixed by contract.

6.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Recognition, Measurement, and Disclosure
Cash is the most liquid of the financial assets and is the standard medium of exchange
for most business transactions.
Cash is usually classified as a current asset and includes unrestricted:
• Coins and currency, including petty cash funds
• Bank accounts funds and deposits
• Negotiable instruments such as money orders, certified cheques, cashiers’ cheques,
personal cheques, bank drafts, and money market funds with chequing privileges.

6.2. Cash and Cash Equivalents

175

Cash can be classified as a long-term asset if they are designated for specific purposes
such as a plant expansion project, or a long-term debt retirement, or as collateral.
Petty cash funds are classified as cash because these funds are used to meet current
operating expenses and to pay current liabilities as they come due. Even though petty
cash has been set aside for a particular purpose, its balance is not material, so it is
included in the cash balance in the financial statements.
Excluded from cash are:
• Post-dated cheques from customers and IOUs (informal letters of a promise to pay
a debt), which are classified as receivables
• Travel advances granted to employees, which are classified as either receivables or
prepaid expenses
• Postage stamps on hand, which are classified as either office supplies (asset) or
prepaid expenses (asset)

Restricted Cash and Compensating Balances
Restricted cash and compensating balances are reported separately from regular cash if
the amount is material. Any legally restricted cash balances are to be separately disclosed
and reported as either a current asset or a long-term asset, depending on the length of
time the cash is restricted and whether the restricted cash offsets a current or a long-term
liability. In practice, many companies do not segregate restricted cash but disclose the
restrictions through note disclosures.
A compensating balance is a minimum cash balance in a company’s chequing or savings account as support for a loan borrowed from a bank (or other lending institution).
By requiring a compensating balance, the bank can use the restricted funds that must
remain on deposit to invest elsewhere resulting in a better rate of return to the bank than
the stated interest rate (also called a face rate) of the loan itself.

Foreign Currencies
Many companies have bank accounts in other countries, especially if they are doing a
lot of business in those countries. A company’s foreign currency is reported in Canadian
dollars at the exchange rate at the date of the balance sheet.
For example, if a company had cash holdings of US $85,000 during the year at a time
when the exchange rate was US $1.00 = Cdn $1.05, at the end of the year when the

176

Cash and Receivables

exchange rate had changed to US $1.00 = Cdn $1.11, the US cash balance would be
reported on the balance sheet in Canadian funds as $94,350 ($85,000×$1.11). Since the
original transaction would have been recorded at Cdn $1.05, the adjusting entry would be
for the difference in exchange rates since that time, or $5,100 ($85,000 ×($1.11 −$1.05)):

Usually, this cash is included in current assets. However, if the cash flow out of the country
is restricted, the cash is treated in the accounts as restricted and reported separately.

Bank Overdrafts
Bank overdrafts (a negative bank balance) can be netted and reported with cash on the
balance sheet if the overdraft is repayable on demand and there are other positive bank
balances in the same bank for which the bank has legal right of access to settle the
overdraft. Otherwise, bank overdrafts are to be reported separately as a current liability.

Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid assets that can readily be converted into
known amounts of cash and with little risk of price fluctuations. An example of a shortterm cash equivalent asset would be one that matures in three months or less from
the acquisition date. They may be considered as “near-cash,” but are not treated as
cash because they can include a penalty to convert back to cash before they mature.
Examples are treasury bills (T-bills), money market funds, short-term notes receivable,
and guaranteed investment certificates (GICs). For companies using ASPE, equities
investments are usually not reported as cash equivalents. For IFRS, preferred shares
that are acquired within three months of their specified redemption date can be included
as cash equivalents.

Disclosures of Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents can be reported at their fair value, together with cash on the balance
sheet. Fair value will be their cost at acquisition plus accrued interest to the date of the
balance sheet.

Financial Instruments
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase
are classified as cash equivalents and are combined and reported with Cash. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase
and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. For example, the Company
classifies its marketable debt securities as either short term or long term based on each
instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. If they have maturities of 12 months or
less, they are classified as short term. Marketable debt securities with maturities greater
than 12 months are classified as long term. The Company classifies its marketable equity
securities, including mutual funds, as either short term or long term based on the nature of
each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable
debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses,
reported either as net income or, net of taxes, as a component of shareholders’ equity
(IFRS 9). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification model. This
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, Investments.
Effective cash management includes strong internal controls and a strategy to invest any
excess cash into short-term instruments that will provide a reasonable return in interest
income but still be quickly convertible back into cash, if required.

6.2.1 Internal Control of Cash
A key part of effective cash management is the internal control of cash. This topic was
introduced in the introductory accounting course. Below are some highlights regarding
internal control.
The purpose of effective financial controls is to:

• Protect assets
• Ensure reliable recognition, measurement, and reporting
• Promote efficient operations
• Encourage compliance with company policies and practices

The control of cash includes implementing internal controls over:

• The physical custody of cash on hand, including adequate levels of authority required for all cash-based transactions and activities
• The separation of duties regarding cash
• Maintaining adequate cash records, including petty cash and the preparation of
regular bank reconciliations.

6.3. Receivables

179

Controlling the physical custody of cash plays a key role in effective cash management. In
the opening story, Apple consolidated its bank accounts to a more manageable number,
converted its idle cash into less accessible commercial paper that earned interest, and
implemented a robust financial reporting system that would provide reliable and timely
information about its cash position.
Refer to 6.6 Appendix A: for a review of internal controls, petty cash, and bank reconciliations taken from an introductory financial accounting textbook.

6.3 Receivables
Receivables are asset accounts applicable to all amounts owing, unsettled transactions,
or other monetary obligations owed to a company by its credit customers or debtors.
These are contractual rights that have future benefits such as future cash flows to the
company. These accounts can be classified as either a current asset, if the company
expects them to be realized within one year or as a long-term asset, if longer than one
year.
Typical receivable-related categories include:

• Accounts (trade) receivable—amounts owed by customers for goods or services
sold by a company on credit in the normal course of business. The transaction
document is typically called an invoice.
• Notes receivable—more formal, unconditional written promises to pay a specified
amount of money on a specified future date or on demand. The transaction document is usually referred to as a promissory note.
• Non-trade receivable—arise from any number of other sources such as income tax
refunds, GST/HST taxes receivable, amounts due from the sale of assets, insurance
claims, advances to employees, amounts due from officers, and dividends receivable. These are generally classified and reported as separate items in the balance
sheet or in a note that is cross-referenced to the balance sheet statement.

and various receivables on the financial statements:

Receivables Management
It is important to consider carefully how to manage and control accounts receivable balances. If credit policies are too restrictive, potential sales could be lost to competitors. If
credit policies are too flexible, more sales to higher risk customers may occur, resulting
in more uncollectible accounts. The bottom line is that receivables management is about
finding the right level of receivables to maintain when implementing the company’s credit
policies.
As part of a credit assessment process, companies will initially assess the individual
creditworthiness of new customers and grant them a credit limit consistent with the level
of assessed credit risk. After the initial assessment, a customer’s payment history will
affect whether their credit limit will change or be revoked.
To lessen the risk of uncollectible accounts and improve cash flows, some companies will
adopt a policy that offers:

• Cash discounts to encourage cash sales
• Sales discounts to encourage faster payments of amounts owing on credit
• Late payment interest charges for any overdue accounts

Other management strategies can be implemented to shorten the receivables to cash
cycle. In addition to the discounts or late payment fees listed above, small- and mediumsized companies may decide to sell their accounts receivable to financial intermediaries
(factors). This will convert the receivables into cash more quickly than if they waited for
customers to pay. Larger companies may rely on another way of selling receivables, called
securitization. This will be discussed later in this chapter.

6.3. Receivables

181

Receivables management involves developing sound business practices for overall monitoring as well as early detection of potential uncollectible accounts. Key activities include:

• Regular analysis of aged accounts receivable
• Regularly scheduled assessments and follow up on overdue accounts

6.3.1 Accounts Receivable
Recognition and Measurement of Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable result from credit sales in the normal course of business (called
trade receivables) that are expected to be collected within one year. For this reason, they
are classified as current receivables on the balance sheet and initially measured at the
time of the credit sale at their net realizable value (NRV). Net realizable value (NRV) is
the amount expected to be received from the customer. IFRS and ASPE standards both
allow NRV to approximate the fair value, since the interest component is immaterial when
determining the present value of cash flows for short-term accounts receivable. In subsequent accounting periods, accounts receivable are to be measured at their amortized
cost which is the same as cost, since there is no present value interest component to
recognize. For long-term notes and loans receivable that have an interest component,
the asset’s carrying amount is measured at amortized cost which will be described later
in this chapter.
The valuation of the account receivable is also affected by:

• Trade and sales discounts
• Sales returns and allowances

Trade Discounts
Manufacturers and wholesalers publish catalogues with inventory and sales prices to
assist purchasers with their purchases. Catalogues are expensive to publish, so this
is only done from time to time. Sellers often offer trade discounts to customers to adjust
the sales prices of items listed in the catalogue. This can be an incentive to purchase
larger quantities, as a benefit of being a preferred customer or because costs to produce
the items for sale have changed.

182

Cash and Receivables

Since the catalogue, or list, price is not intended to reflect the actual selling price, the
seller records the net amount after the trade discount is applied. For example, if a
plumbing manufacturer has a catalogue or list price of $1000 for a bathtub and sells it
to a plumbing retailer for list price less a 20% trade discount, the sale and corresponding
account receivable recorded by the manufacturer is $800 per bathtub.

Sales Discounts
Sales discounts can be part of the credit terms for customers and are offered to encourage
faster payment of the account. The credit term 1.5/10, n/30 means there is a 1.5%
discount if the invoice is paid within ten days with the total amount owed due in thirty
days.
Companies purchasing goods and services that do not take advantage of the sales discounts are usually not using their cash as effectively as they could. For example, a
purchaser who fails to take the 1.5% reduction offered for payment within ten days for
an account due in thirty days is equivalent to missing a stated annual interest rate return
on their cash for 27.38% (365 days ÷20 days ×1.5%). For this reason, companies usually
pay within the discount period unless their available cash is insufficient to take advantage
of the opportunity.
IFRS 15.53 – the term variable consideration, discussed in Chapter 5, Revenue, would
also include sales discounts because it is uncertain how many customers will actually
take the sales discount. For this reason, IFRS states that an estimate of “highly probable”
sales discounts expected to be taken by customers, needs to be determined and included
at the time of the sale. Given the high rate of return identified in the preceding paragraph,
recording the estimate immediately upon sale is conceptually sound and is consistent
with the net method described below. The standard suggests using either the expected
value (a weighted average of probabilities), or the “most likely amount” to estimate sales
discounts, perhaps based on past history.
To illustrate the net method, assume that Cramer Plumbing sells fifty bathtubs to a reseller
for $800 each, for a total sale of $40,000, with credit terms of 1.5/10, n/30. Using the net
method, Cramer expects that the sales discount will be taken by the purchaser; therefore,
Cramer Plumbing will record the following entry:

Note the reduction due to the sales discount is immediately recorded upon the sale. This

results in the accounts receivable being valued at its net realizable value and based on
Cramer’s “more likely than not” estimate of sales discounts expected to be taken, which
is consistent with IFRS 15.53.
If $10,000 of the account receivable is collected from the reseller within the ten-day

As can be seen above, the net method records and values the accounts receivable at
its lowest, or net realizable value of $39,400, or gross sales for $40,000 less the 1.5%
discount.
The gross method is much easier and ASPE can choose either method. For the gross
method, sales are recorded at the gross amount with no discount taken. If the customer
pays within the discount period, the applicable discount taken is recorded to a sales
discounts account. Any payments made after the discount period are simply the cash
amount collected and no calculation for the sales discounts forfeited is required.
Using the same example, assume that Cramer Plumbing sells fifty bathtubs for $800 each,
with credit terms of 1.5/10, n/30. Using the gross method, the entry for the sale is:

Note how the accounts receivable would not be reported at its net realizable value with
this method. If discounts are significant, this would overstate accounts receivable and
sales in the financial statements. For this reason, if the gross method is used and it is
expected that significant cash discounts are likely to be taken by customers in the fiscal
year, an asset valuation account and an adjusting entry is required to ensure that
accounts receivable, net of the valuation account, will reflect its net realizable value.
At year-end, assume that $6 million of Cramer’s accounts receivable all have terms of
1.5/10, n/30, and management expects that 60% of these accounts will be collected within
the discount period, which it deems to be significant. The unadjusted balance in the
allowance for sales discounts account (a contra account to accounts receivable) is
$3,000 credit balance. The year-end adjusting entry to update the accounts receivable
allowance account with the estimated sales discounts would be:

Sales Returns and Allowances
Many ASPE companies have policies that allow for the return of goods under certain
circumstances and will refund all or a partial amount of the returned item’s cost.
Assuming that returns for this company are insignificant, the entry for a $1,000 sales return on account (with a cost $800) returned to inventory, for a company using a perpetual
inventory system, would be:

Sales allowances are reductions in the selling price for goods sold to customers, perhaps
due to damaged goods that the customer is willing to keep if the sales price is reduced
sufficiently.
For example, if a sales allowance of $2,000 is granted due to damaged goods that the
customer chose to keep, the entry, assuming sales allowances for this company are
insignificant, would be:

As was done with sales discounts, sales returns and allowances should be recognized in
the period of the sale to avoid overstating accounts receivable and sales. Sales returns
and allowances are therefore estimated and adjusted at the end of each reporting period.
If the amount of returns and allowances is not material a year-end adjusting entry is not
required and the entries shown above would be sufficient, provided that it is handled
consistently from year to year. If returns and allowances are significant, an allowance
for sales returns and allowances account, which is an asset valuation account contra
to accounts receivable, is used to record the estimates.
For example, management estimates the total sales returns and allowances to be $51,500,
which it deems to be significant. If the company follows ASPE, and the unadjusted

186

balance in the allowance for sales returns and allowances account is $5,000 credit
balance, the year-end adjusting entry would be:

Note how another contra account, the sales returns and allowances account, is used
to record the debit entry for the previous two journal entries above. Its purpose is to track
returns and allowances transactions separately, as opposed to directly recording them as
a debit to sales. If amounts in this contra account become too high, it could indicate to
management the possibility of future sales lost due to unsatisfied customers.
During the reporting period, the allowance for sales returns and allowances asset
valuation account can be directly debited each time customers are granted returns or
allowances. This asset valuation account will subsequently be adjusted up or down at the
end of each reporting period.
Sales with right of return under IFRS has been discussed in Section 5.3.3, Sales With
Right of Return, where a detailed example is presented.

Estimating Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
When accounts receivables exist, some amounts of uncollectible receivables are inevitable
due to credit risk. This risk is the likelihood of loss due to customers not paying their
amounts owing. If the uncollectible amounts are both likely and can be estimated, an
amount for uncollectible accounts must be estimated and recognized in the accounts to
ensure that accounts receivable and net income are not overstated over the lifetime of
the accounts receivable (IFRS 9; lifetime expected credit losses). The allowance account,
called the allowance for doubtful accounts (AFDA), is an asset valuation account (contra
account to accounts receivable), which is used the same way as the Allowance for Sales
Discounts discussed earlier.
Many companies set their credit policies to allow for a certain percentage of uncollectible
accounts. This is to ensure that the credit policy is not too restrictive or liberal, as explained in the opening paragraph of the Receivables Management section of this chapter.

6.3. Receivables

187

Measuring uncollectible amounts at the end of each reporting period involves estimates
that can be calculated using several methods:

• Percentage of accounts receivable method
• Accounts receivable aging method
• Credit sales method
• Mix of methods

The first three methods were covered in the introductory accounting course. Below is a
review of these methods. The mix of methods is perhaps a more realistic view of how
companies estimate bad debt expense over a reporting period.
For each method above, management estimates a percentage that will represent the likelihood of collectability. The estimated total amount of uncollectible accounts is calculated
and usually recorded to the AFDA allowance account, with the offsetting entry to bad
debt expense. The net amount for accounts receivable and its contra account, the AFDA,
reflects the net realizable value of the accounts receivable at the reporting date.
Percentage of Accounts Receivable Method
For this method, the accounts receivable closing balance is multiplied by the percentage
that management estimates is uncollectible. This method is based on the premise that
some portion of accounts receivable will be uncollectible, and management uses reasonably available and supportable information (IFRS 9) regarding past experiences, current
economic conditions, and expected future conditions as a guide to the percentage used.
For this reason, the estimated amount of uncollectible accounts is to be equal to the
adjusted ending balance of the AFDA. The adjusting entry amount must therefore be the
amount required that results in that ending balance of the AFDA.
For example, assume that accounts receivable and the AFDA ending balances were
$200,000 debit and $2,500 credit balances respectively at December 31, and the uncollectible accounts is estimated to be 4% of accounts receivable. This means that the
AFDA adjusted ending balance is estimated to be the amount equal to 4% of $200,000,
or $8,000. The adjusting entry to achieve the correct AFDA adjusted ending balance of
$8,000 would be:

Cash and Receivables

The AFDA ending balance after the adjusting entry would correctly be $8,000
($2,500 unadjusted balance + $5,500 adjusting entry).
Sometimes the AFDA ending balance can be in a temporary debit balance due to a
write-off of an uncollectible account during the period. If this is the case, care must be
taken to make the correct calculations for the adjusting entry. For the example above,
if the unadjusted AFDA balance was a $300 debit balance, then the adjusting entry for
uncollectible accounts would be:
Date

Bad debt expense. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

PR

Credit

The AFDA ending balance after the adjusting entry would correctly be $8,000 ($300 debit+
$8,300 credit).
Notice that the AFDA ending balance of $8,000 is the same for both examples when
applying the percentage of accounts receivable method. This is because the calculation
is intended to be an estimate of the AFDA ending balance, so the adjustment amount is
whatever is required to result in that ending balance.
Accounts Receivable Aging Method
Typically, the older the uncollected account, the more likely it is to be uncollectible. Following this premise, the accounts receivable are grouped into categories based on the
length of time they have been outstanding.
Just as was done for the percentage of accounts receivable method above, companies will
use past experience to estimate the percentage of their outstanding receivables that will
become uncollectible for each aged group, such as the four aging groups identified in the
schedule below. The sum of all the estimated uncollectible amounts by group represents
the total estimated uncollectible accounts. Just like the percentage of accounts receivable
method previously discussed, the estimated amount of uncollectible accounts using this
method is to be equal to the ending balance of the AFDA account. The adjusting entry
amount must therefore be whatever amount is required to result in this ending balance.
Aging schedules are also a good indicator of which accounts may need additional
attention by management, due to their higher credit risk group, such as the length of
time the account has been outstanding or overdue.
Below is an example of an accounts receivable aging schedule:

The analysis above indicates that Taylor and Company expects to receive $186,480
less $18,053, or $168,427 net cash receipts from the December 31 amounts owed.
The $168,427 represents the company’s estimated net realizable value of its accounts
receivable and this amount would be reported as the net accounts receivable in the
balance sheet as at December 31.
Assuming the data above for Taylor and Company and an unadjusted AFDA credit balance
as at December 31 of $2,500, the adjusting entry for uncollectible accounts would be:

As was illustrated for the percentage of accounts receivable method above, the calculation
of the adjusting entry amount must consider whether the unadjusted AFDA balance is a
debit or credit amount.
Credit Sales Method
This is the easiest method to apply. The amount of credit sales (or total sales, if credit
sales are not determinable) is multiplied by the percentage that management estimates
is uncollectible. Factors to consider when determining the percentage amount to use
will be trends resulting from amounts of uncollectible accounts in proportion to credit

190

Cash and Receivables

sales experienced in the past. The resulting amount is credited to the AFDA account
and debited to bad debt expense.
Note that for this method, the previous balance in the AFDA account is not taken into
consideration. This is because the credit sales method is intended to calculate the bad
debt expense that will be reported in the income statement. This is a fast and simple way
to estimate bad debt expense because the amount of sales (or preferably credit sales) is
known and readily available. This method also illustrates proper matching of expenses
with revenues earned over that reporting period.
For example, if credit sales were $325,000 at the end of the period and the uncollectible
accounts was estimated to be 3% of credit sales, the entry would be:

Mix of Methods
Often companies will use the percentage of credit sales method to adjust the net accounts
receivables for interim (monthly) financial reporting purposes because it is easy to apply.
At the end of the year, either the percentage of accounts receivable or aging accounts
receivable method is used for purposes of preparing the year-end financial statements so
that the AFDA account is adjusted accordingly, and reported on the balance sheet.
Below is a partial balance sheet for Taylor and Company using the data from the Accounts
Receivable Aging Method section above:

To summarize, the $186,480 represents the total amount of trade accounts receivables
owing from all the credit customers at the reporting date of December 31, 2015. The
$18,053 represents the estimated amount of uncollectible accounts calculated using the
allowance method, the percentage of sales method, or a mix of methods. The $168,427
represents the net realizable value (NRV) of the receivable at the reporting date.

Write-offs and Collections
Write-off of an Actual Uncollectible Account
Management may deem that a customer’s account is uncollectible and may wish to remove the account balance from accounts receivable with the offsetting entry to the allowance for doubtful accounts. For example, using the data for Taylor and Company
shown under the accounts receivable aging method, assume that management wishes
to remove the account for Cambridge Instruments Co. of $18,000 because it remains
unpaid despite efforts to collect the account. The entry to remove the account from the
accounting records is:

Credit

Because the AFDA is a contra account to accounts receivable, and both have been
reduced by identical amounts, there is no effect on the net accounts receivable (NRV)
on the balance sheet. This treatment and entry makes sense because the estimate for
uncollectible accounts adjusting entry (with a debit to bad debt expense) had already been
done using one of the allowance methods discussed earlier. The purpose of the write-off
entry is to simply remove the account from the accounting records.
Collection of a Previously Written-off Account
Even though management at Taylor and Company thinks that the collection of the $18,000
account has become unlikely, this does not mean that the company will make no further
efforts to collect the amount outstanding from the purchaser. During the tough economic
times in 2009 and onward, many companies were in such financial distress that they were
simply unable to pay their amounts owing. Many of their accounts had to be written-off
by suppliers during that time as companies struggled to survive the crisis. Some of these
companies recovered through good management, and cash flows returned. It is important
for these companies to rebuild their relationships with suppliers they had previously not
paid. So, it is not uncommon for these companies, after recovery, to make efforts to pay
bills that the supplier had previously written-off.
As a result, a supplier may be fortunate enough to receive some or all of a previously
written-off account from a customer. When this happens, a two-step process accounts for
the payment:

1. Reinstate the account receivable amount being paid by reversing the previous writeoff entry for an amount equal to the payment now received.

192

Cash and Receivables

2. Record the cash received as a collection of the accounts receivable amount reinstated in the first entry.

If Cambridge Instruments Co. pays $5,000 cash and indicates that this is all that the
company can pay of the original $18,000, the entry would be:
Step 1: Reinstate the account receivable upon receipt of cash (reversing a portion of the

Summary of Transactions and Adjusting Entries
An understanding of the relationships between the accounts receivable and the AFDA
accounts and the types of transactions that affect them are important for sound accounts

Direct Write-off of Uncollectible Accounts
Some smaller companies may only have a few credit sales transactions and small accounts receivable balances. These companies usually use the simpler direct write-off
method because the amount of uncollectible accounts is deemed to be immaterial. This
means that when a specific customer account is determined to be uncollectible, the
account receivable for that customer account is written-off with the debit entry recorded
to bad debt expense as shown in the following entry:

If the uncollectible amounts were material, it would not be appropriate to use the direct
write-off method, for many reasons:

194

Cash and Receivables

• Without an estimate for uncollectible accounts, net account receivables would be
reported at an amount higher than their net realizable value.
• The write-off of the uncollectible account will likely occur in a different year than the
sale, which will create over- and under-statements of net income over the affected
years resulting in non-compliance of the matching principle.
• Direct write-off creates an opportunity to manipulate asset amounts and net income.
For example, management might delay a direct write-off to keep net income high
artificially if this will favourably affect a bonus payment.

This section of the chapter is intended to be a summary overview of the methods and
entries used to estimate and write-off uncollectible accounts originally covered in detail in
the introductory accounting course. Students may wish to review those learning concepts
from that course.

6.3.2 Notes Receivable
Recognition and Measurement of Notes Receivable
A note receivable is an unconditional written promise to pay a specific sum of money
on demand or on a defined future date and is supported by a formal written promissory
note. For this reason, notes are negotiable instruments the same as cheques and bank
drafts.
Notes receivable can arise due to loans, advances to employees, or from higher-risk
customers who need to extend the payment period of an outstanding account receivable.
Notes can also be used for sales of property, plant, and equipment or for exchanges of
long-term assets. Notes arising from loans usually identify collateral security in the form
of assets of the borrower that the lender can seize if the note is not paid at the maturity
date.
Notes may be referred to as interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing:

• Interest-bearing notes have a stated rate of interest that is payable in addition to the
face value of the note.
• Notes with stated rates below the market rates or zero- or non-interest-bearing notes
may or may not have a stated rate of interest. This is usually done to encourage
sales. However, there is always an interest component embedded in the note, and
that amount will be equal to the difference between the amount that was borrowed
and the amount that will be repaid.

6.3. Receivables

195

Notes may also be classified as short-term (current) assets or long-term assets on the
balance sheet:

• Current assets: short-term notes that become due within the next twelve months (or
within the business’s operating cycle if greater than twelve months);
• Long-term assets: notes are notes with due dates greater than one year.

Cash payments can be interest-only with the principal portion payable at the end or a mix
of interest and principal throughout the term of the note.
Notes receivable are initially recognized at the fair value on the date that the note is legally
executed (usually upon signing). Subsequent valuation is measured at amortized cost.
Transaction Costs
It is common for notes to incur transactions costs, especially if the note receivable is
acquired using a broker, who will charge a commission for their services. For a company
using either ASPE or IFRS, the transaction costs associated with financial assets such
as notes receivable that are carried at amortized cost are to be capitalized which means
that the costs are to be added to the asset’s fair value of the note at acquisition and
subsequently included with any discount or premium and amortized over the term of the
note.

Short-Term Notes Receivable
When notes receivable have terms of less than one year, accounting for short-term notes
is relatively straight forward as discussed below.
Calculating the Maturity Date
Knowing the correct maturity date will have an impact on when to record the entry for
the note and how to calculate the correct interest amount throughout the note’s life. For
example, to calculate the maturity date of a ninety-day note dated March 14, 2015:

For example, assume that on March 14, 2015, Ripple Stream Co. accepted a ninetyday, 8% note of $5,000 in exchange for extending the payment period of an outstanding
account receivable of the same value. Ripple’s entry to record the acceptance of the note
that will replace the accounts receivable is:

March 14 to April 30 would be:

Note the difference in the interest calculation between the ninety-day and the three-month
notes recorded above. The interest amounts differ slightly between the two calculations
because the ninety-day note uses a 90/365 ratio (or 24.6575% for a total amount of
$98.63) while the three-month note uses a 3/12 ratio (or 25% for a total of $100.00).
Receivables, Interest, and the Time Value of Money
All financial assets are to be measured initially at their fair value which is calculated as
the present value amount of future cash receipts. But what is present value? It is a
discounted cash flow concept, which is explained next.
It is common knowledge that money deposited in a savings account will earn interest, or
money borrowed from a bank will accrue interest payable to the bank. The present value
of a note receivable is therefore the amount that you would need to deposit today, at a
given rate of interest, which will result in a specified future amount at maturity. The cash
flow is discounted to a lesser sum that eliminates the interest component—hence the term

198

Cash and Receivables

discounted cash flow. The future amount can be a single payment at the date of maturity
or a series of payments over future time periods or some combination of both. Put into
context for receivables, if a company must wait until a future date to receive the payment
for its receivable, the receivable’s face value at maturity will not be an exact measure of
its fair value on the date the note is legally executed because of the embedded interest
component.
For example, assume that a company makes a sale on account for $5,000 and receives
a $5,000, six-month note receivable in exchange. The face value of the note is therefore
$5,000. If the market rate of interest is 9%, or its value without the interest component,
is $4,780.79 and not $5,000. The $4,780.79 is the amount that if deposited today at an
interest rate of 9% would equal $5,000 at the end of six months. Using an equation, the
note can be expressed as:
(0 PMT, .75% I/Y, 6 N, 5000 FV)
Where I/Y is interest of .75% each month (9%/12 months) for six months.
N is for interest compounded each month for six months.
FV is the payment at the end of six months’ time (future value) of $5,000.
To summarize, the discounted amount of $4,780.79 is the fair value of the $5,000 note
at the time of the sale, and the additional amount received after the sale of $219.21
($5,000.00 − $4,780.79) is interest income earned over the term of the note (six months).
However, for any receivables due in less than one year, this interest income component
is usually insignificant. For this reason, both IFRS and ASPE allow net realizable value
(the net amount expected to be received in cash) to approximate the fair value for shortterm notes receivables that mature within one year. So, in the example above, the $5,000
face value of the six-month note will be equivalent to the fair value and will be the amount
reported, net of any estimated uncollectability (i.e. net realizable value), on the balance
sheet until payment is received. However, for notes with maturity dates greater than one
year, fair values are to be determined at their discounted cash flow or present value, which
will be discussed next.

Long-Term Notes Receivable
The difference between a short-term note and a long-term note is the length of time to
maturity. As the length of time to maturity of the note increases, the interest component
becomes increasingly more significant. As a result, any notes receivable that are greater
than one year to maturity are classified as long-term notes and require the use of present
values to estimate their fair value at the time of issuance. After issuance, long-term notes
receivable are measured at amortized cost. Determining present values requires an

6.3. Receivables

analysis of cash flows using interest rates and time lines, as illustrated next.
Present Values and Time Lines
The following timelines will illustrate how present value using discounted cash flows works.
Below are three different scenarios:

1. Assume that on January 1, Maxwell lends some money in exchange for a $5,000,
five-year note, payable as a lump-sum at the end of five years. The market rate
of interest is 5%. Maxwell’s year-end is December 31. The first step is to identify
the amount(s) and timing of all the cash flows as illustrated below on the timeline.
The amount of money that Maxwell would be willing to lend the borrower using the
present value calculation of the cash flows would be $3,917.63 as follows:
N = years

0

3

5
$5,000

Present Value (PV) = $3,917.63
PV = (0 PMT, 5 I/Y, 5 N, 5000 FV)
where I/Y is interest
N is # of periods
FV is future value

In this case, Maxwell will be willing to lend $3,917.63 today in exchange for a
payment of $5,000 at the end of five years at an interest rate of 5% per annum.
The entry for the note receivable at the date of issuance would be:

2. Now assume that on January 1, Maxwell lends an amount of money in exchange for
a $5,000, five-year note. The market rate of interest is 5%. The repayment of the
note is payments of $1,000 at the end of each year for the next five years (present
value of an ordinary annuity). The amount of money that Maxwell would be willing
to lend the borrower using the present value calculation of the cash flows would be
$4,329.48 as follows:

Note that Maxwell is willing to lend more money ($4,329.48 compared to $3,917.63)
to the borrower in this example. Another way of looking at it is that the interest
component embedded in the note is less for this example. This makes sense
because the principal amount of the note is being reduced over its five-year life
because of the yearly payments of $1,000.
3. How would the amount of the loan and the entries above differ if Maxwell received
five equal payments of $1,000 at the beginning of each year (present value of an
annuity due) instead of at the end of each year as shown in scenario 2 above?
The amount of money that Maxwell would be willing to lend using the present value
calculation of the cash flows would be $4,545.95 as follows:

Again, the interest component will be less because a payment is paid immediately
upon execution of the note, which causes the principal amount to be reduced sooner
than a payment made at the end of each year.

Below is a comparison of the three scenarios:

Face value of the note
Less: present value of the note
Interest component

Scenario 1

Scenario 2

Scenario 3

Single payment
at maturity

Five payments of
$1,000 at the end
of each month
$5,000
4,329
$671

Five payments of
$1,000 at the beginning
of each month
$5,000
4,546
$454

$5,000
3,918
$1,082

Note that the interest component decreases for each of the scenarios even though the
total cash repaid is $5,000 in each case. This is due to the timing of the cash flows as
discussed earlier. In scenario 1, the principal is not reduced until maturity and interest
would accrue over the full five years of the note. For scenario 2, the principal is being

202

Cash and Receivables

reduced on an annual basis, but the payment is not made until the end of each year. For
scenario 3, there is an immediate reduction of principal due to the first payment of $1,000
upon issuance of the note. The remaining four payments are made at the beginning
instead of at the end of each year. This results in a reduction in the principal amount
owing upon which the interest is calculated.
This is the same concept as a mortgage owing for a house, where it is commonly stated
by financial advisors that a mortgage payment split and paid every half-month instead of
a single payment once per month will result in a significant reduction in interest costs over
the term of the mortgage. The bottom line is: If there is less principal amount owing at
any time over the life of a note, there will be less interest charged.
Present Values with Unknown Variables
As is the case with any algebraic equation, if all variables except one are known, the final
unknown variable can be determined. For present value calculations, if any four of the
five variables in the following equation
PV = (PMT, I/Y, N, FV)
are known, the fifth “unknown” variable amount can be determined using a business
calculator or an Excel net present value function. For example, if the interest rate (I/Y) is
not known, it can be derived if all the other variables in the equation are known. This will
be illustrated when non-interest-bearing long-term notes receivable are discussed later in
this chapter.
Present Values when Stated Interest Rates are Different than Effective (Market)
Interest Rates
Differences between the stated interest rate (or face rate) and the effective (or market)
rate at the time a note is issued can have accounting consequences as follows:
• If the stated interest rate of the note (which is the interest rate that the note pays) is
10% at a time when the effective interest rate (also called the market rate, or yield)
is 10% for notes with similar characteristics and risk, the note is initially recognized
as:
face value = fair value = present value of the note
This makes intuitive sense since the stated rate of 10% is equal to the market rate
of 10%.
• If the stated interest rate is 10% and the market rate is 11%, the stated rate is lower
than the market rate and the note is trading at a discount.
If stated rate lower than market

Present value lower

Difference is a discount

6.3. Receivables

203

• If the stated interest rate is 10% and the market rate is 9%, the stated rate is higher
than the market rate and the note is trading at a premium.
If stated rate higher than market

Present value higher

Difference is a premium

The premium or discount amount is to be amortized over the term of the note. Below are
the acceptable methods to amortize discounts or premiums:

• If a company follows IFRS, the effective interest method of amortization is required
(discussed in the next section).
• If a company follows ASPE, the amortization method is not specified, so either
straight-line amortization or the effective interest method is appropriate as an accounting policy choice.

Long-Term Notes, Subsequent Measurement
Under IFRS and ASPE, long-term notes receivable that are held for their cash flows
of principal and interest are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost, which is
calculated as:

• Amount recognized when initially acquired (present value) including any transaction
costs such as commissions or fees
• Plus interest and minus any principal collections/receipts. Payments can also be
blended interest and principal.
• Plus amortization of discount or minus amortization of premium
• Minus write-downs for impairment, if applicable

Below are some examples with journal entries involving various stated rates compared to
market rates.
1. Notes Issued at Face Value
Assume that on January 1, Carpe Diem Ltd. lends $10,000 to Fascination Co. in exchange
for a $10,000, three-year note bearing interest at 10% payable annually at the end of each
year (ordinary annuity). The market rate of interest for a note of similar risk is also 10%.
The note’s present value is calculated as:

204

Cash and Receivables

Face value of the note
Present value of the note principal and interest:
Interest = $10,000 × 10% = $1,000 PMT
PV = (1000 PMT, 10 I/Y, 3 N, 10000 FV)
Difference

$ 10,000

10,000

In this case, the note’s face value and present value (fair value) are the same ($10,000)
because the effective (market) and stated interest rates are the same. Carpe Diem’s entry

2. Stated Rate Lower than Market Rate: A Discount
Assume that Anchor Ltd. makes a loan to Sizzle Corp. in exchange for a $10,000, threeyear note bearing interest at 10% payable annually. The market rate of interest for a note
of similar risk is 12%. Recall that the stated rate of 10% determines the amount of the
cash received for interest; however, the present value uses the effective (market) rate to
discount all cash flows to determine the amount to record as the note’s value at the time
of issuance. The note’s present value is calculated as:
Face value of the note
Present value of the note principal and interest:
Interest = $10,000 × 10% = $1,000 PMT
PV = (1000 PMT, 12 I/Y, 3 N, 10000 FV)
Difference

$ 10,000

$

9,520
480

As shown above, the note’s market rate (12%) is higher than the stated rate (10%), so the
note is issued at a discount.

Even though the face value of the note is $10,000, the amount of money lent to Sizzle
would only be $9,520, which is net of the discount amount and is the difference between
the stated and market interest rates discussed earlier. In return, Anchor will receive an
annual cash payment of $1,000 for three years plus a lump sum payment of $10,000 at
the end of the third year, when the note matures. The total cash payments received will
be $13,000 over the term of the note, and the interest component of the note would be:
Cash received
Present value (fair value)
Interest income component

$13,000
9,520
3,480

(over the three-year life)

As mentioned earlier, if Anchor used IFRS the $480 discount amount would be amortized
using the effective interest method. If Anchor used ASPE, there would be a choice
between the effective interest method and the straight-line method.
Below is a schedule that calculates the cash received, interest income, discount amortization, and the carrying amount (book value) of the note at the end of each year using the
effective interest method:

The total discount $480 amortized in the schedule is equal to the difference between the
face value of the note of $10,000 and the present value of the note principal and interest of

206

Cash and Receivables

$9,250. The amortized discount is added to the note’s carrying value each year, thereby
increasing its carrying amount until it reaches its maturity value of $10,000. As a result,
the carrying amount at the end of each period is always equal to the present value of the
note’s remaining cash flows discounted at the 12% market rate. This is consistent with
the accounting standards for the subsequent measurement of long-term notes receivable
at amortized cost.

1 using the schedule above, Anchor’s entry would be:

Alternatively, if Anchor used ASPE the straight-line method of amortizing the discount is
simple to apply. The total discount of $480 is amortized over the three-year term of the
note in equal amounts. The annual amortization of the discount is $160 ($480 ÷ 3 years)
for each of the three years as shown in the following entry:

Comparing the three years’ entries for both the effective interest and straight-line methods
shows the following pattern for the discount amortization of the note receivable:

159
End of year 3
179
$480

Straight-Line
$160

$480

The amortization of the discount using the effective interest method results in increasing amounts of interest income that will be recorded in the adjusting entry (decreasing
amounts of interest income for amortizing a premium) compared to the equal amounts
of interest income using the straight-line method. The straight-line method is easier to
apply but its shortcoming is that the interest rate (yield) for the note is not held constant
at the 12% market rate as is the case when the effective interest method is used. This

6.3. Receivables

207

is because the amortization of the discount is in equal amounts and does not take into
consideration what the carrying amount of the note was at any given period of time. At
the end of year 3, the notes receivable balance is $10,000 for both methods, so the same
entry is recorded for the receipt of the cash.

3. Stated Rate More than Market Rate: A Premium
Had the note’s stated rate of 10% been greater than a market rate of 9%, the present
value would be greater than the face value of the note due to the premium. The same
types of calculations and entries as shown in the previous illustration regarding a discount
would be used. Note that the premium amortized each year would decrease the carrying
amount of the note at the end of each year until it reaches its face value amount of
$10,000.

4. Zero-Interest Bearing Notes
Some companies will issue zero-interest-bearing notes as a sales incentive. The notes
do not state an interest rate but the term “zero-interest” is inaccurate because financial
instruments always include an interest component that is equal to the difference between
the cash lent and the higher amount of cash repaid at maturity. Even though the interest
rate is not stated, the implied interest rate can be derived because the cash values lent
and received are both known. In most cases, the transaction between the issuer and
acquirer of the note is at arm’s length, so the implicit interest rate would be a reasonable
estimate of the market rate.
Assume that on January 1, Eclipse Corp. received a five-year, $10,000 zero-interest
bearing note. The amount of cash lent to the issuer (which is equal to the present value)
is $7,835 (rounded). Eclipse’s year-end is December 31. Looking at the cash flows and
the time line:

PV is the amount of cash lent
N is # of periods
FV is the future cash received
Interest = 5% (rounded), or $2,165

6.3. Receivables

209

Notice that the sign for the $7,835 PV is preceded by the +/- symbol, meaning that the PV
amount is to have the opposite symbol to the $10,000 FV amount, shown as a positive
value. This is because the FV is the cash received at maturity or cash inflow (positive
value), while the PV is the cash lent or a cash outflow (opposite or negative value). Many
business calculators require the use of a +/- sign for one value and no sign (or a positive
value) for the other to calculate imputed interest rates correctly. Consult your calculator
manual for further instructions regarding zero-interest note calculations.
The implied interest rate is calculated to be 5% and the note’s interest component (rounded)
is $2,165 ($10,000−$7,835), which is the difference between the cash lent and the higher
amount of cash repaid at maturity. Below is the schedule for the interest and amortization
calculations using the effective interest method.

5. Notes Receivable in Exchange for Property, Goods, or Services
When property, goods, or services are exchanged for a note, and the market rate and
the timing and amounts of cash received are all known, the present value of the note can
be determined. For example, assume that on May 1, Hudson Inc. receives a $200,000,
five-year note in exchange for land originally costing $120,000. The market rate for a note
with similar characteristics and risks is 8%. The present value is calculated as follows:
PV = (0 PMT, 8 I/Y, 5 N, 200000 FV)
PV = $136,117
The entry upon issuance of the note and sale of the land would be:

However, if the market rate is not known, either of following two approaches can be used
to determine the fair value of the note:
a. Determine the fair value of the property, goods, or services given up. As was
discussed for zero-interest bearing notes where the interest rate was not known,
the implicit interest rate can still be derived because the cash amount lent, and the

6.3. Receivables

211

timing and amount of the cash flows received from the issuer are both known. In
this case the amount lent is the fair value of the property, goods, or services given
up. Once the interest is calculated, the effective interest method can be applied.1
For example, on June 1, Mayflower Consulting Ltd. receives a $40,000, three-year
note in exchange for some land. The market rate cannot be accurately determined
due to credit risks regarding the issuer. The land cost and fair value is $31,750. The
interest rate is calculated as follows:
I/Y = (+/-31750 PV, 0 PMT, 3 N, 40000 FV)
I/Y = 8%; the interest income component is $8,250 over three years ($40,000 −
$31,750)
The entry upon issuance of the note would be:

b. Determine an imputed interest rate. An imputed interest rate is an estimated
interest rate used for a note with comparable terms, conditions, and risks between
an independent borrower and lender.
On June 1, Edmunds Co. receives a $30,000, three-year note in exchange for some
swampland. The land has a historic cost of $5,000 but neither the market rate nor the
fair value of the land can be determined. In this case, a market rate must be imputed
and used to determine the note’s present value. The rate will be estimated based
on interest rates currently in effect for companies with similar characteristics and
credit risk as the company issuing the note. For IFRS companies, the “evaluation
hierarchy” identified in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement would be used to determine
the fair value of the land and the imputed interest rate. In this case, the imputed rate
is determined to be 7%. The present value is calculated as follows:
PV = (7 I/Y, 3 N, 30000 FV)
PV = $24,489
The entry upon issuance of the note would be:

Source: http://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/ifrs/ifrs13 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
applies to IFRSes that require or permit fair value measurements or disclosures and provides a single
IFRS framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurement. The
Standard defines fair value on the basis of an “exit price” notion and uses a “fair value hierarchy,” which
results in a market-based, rather than entity-specific, measurement. IFRS 13 was originally issued in May
2011 and applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and is beyond the scope of this
course. For simplicity, the fair value of the property, goods or services given up as explained in the chapter
material assumes that IFRS 13 assumptions and hierarchy to determine fair values have been appropriately
considered.

Loans to employees
In cases where there are non-interest-bearing long-term loans to company employees,
the fair value is determined by using the market rate for loans with similar characteristics,
and the present value is calculated on that basis. The amount loaned to the employee
invariably will be higher than the present value using the market rate because the loan
is intended as a reward or incentive. This difference would be deemed as additional
compensation and recorded as Compensation expense.
Impairment of notes receivable
Just as was the case with accounts receivable, there is a possibility that the holder of
the note receivable will not be able to collect some or all of the amounts owing. If
this happens, the receivable is considered impaired. When the investment in a note
receivable becomes impaired for any reason, the receivable is re-measured at the present
value of the currently expected cash flows at the loan’s original effective interest rate.
The impairment amount is recorded as a debit to bad debt expense and as a credit either
to an allowance for uncollectible notes account (a contra account to notes receivable) or
directly as a reduction to the asset account.

6.3.3 Derecognition and Sale of Receivables: Shortening the
Credit-to-Cash Cycle
Derecognition is the removal of a previously recognized receivable from the company’s
balance sheet. In the normal course of business, receivables arise from credit sales and,
once paid, are removed (derecognized) from the books. However, this takes valuable time
and resources to turn receivables into cash. As someone once said, “turnover is vanity,
profit is sanity, but cash is king”2 . Simply put, a business can report all the profits possible,
but profits do not mean cash resources. Sound cash flow management has always been
important but, since the economic downturn in 2008, it has become the key to survival
for many struggling businesses. As a result, companies are always looking for ways to
shorten the credit-to-cash cycle to maximize their cash resources. Two such ways are
secured borrowings and sales of receivables, discussed next.
2

“Cash is king” is a catch phrase for “cash is most important.” While a firm can generate a profit, if it
cannot be converted to cash fast enough to pay the liabilities as they are due, then the company runs the
risk of failing.

6.3. Receivables

213

Secured Borrowings
Companies often use receivables as collateral for a loan or a bank line of credit. The
receivables are pledged as security for the loan, but the control and collection often remain
with the company, so the receivables are left on the company’s books. The company
records the proceeds of the loan received from the finance company as a liability with the
loan interest and any other finance charges recorded as expenses. If a company defaults
on its loan, the finance company can seize the secured receivables and directly collect the
cash from the receivables as payment against the defaulted loan. This will be illustrated
in the section on factoring, below.
Sales of Receivables
What is the accounting treatment if a company’s receivables are transferred (sold) to
a third party (factor)? Certain industry sectors, such as auto dealerships and almost
all small- and medium-sized businesses selling high-cost goods (e.g., gym equipment
retailers) make extensive use of third-party financing arrangements with their customers
to speed up the credit-to-cash cycle. Whether a receivable is transferred to a factor (sale)
or held as security for a loan (borrowing) depends on the criteria set out in IFRS and
ASPE which are discussed next.
Conditions for Treatment as a Sale
For accounting purposes, the receivables should be derecognized as a sale when they
meet the following criteria:
IFRS—substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred to the factor.
The evidence for this is that the contractual rights to receive the cash flows have been
transferred (or the company continues to collect and forward all the cash it collects without
delay) to the factor. As well, the company cannot sell or pledge any of these receivables
to any third parties other than to the factor.
ASPE—control of the receivables has been surrendered by the transferor. This is
evidenced when the following three conditions are all met:
a. The transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor.
b. The factor has obtained the right to pledge or to sell the transferred assets.
c. The transferor does not maintain effective control of the transferred assets through
a repurchase agreement.
If the conditions for either IFRS or ASPE are not met, the receivables remain in the
accounts and the transaction is treated as a secured borrowing (recorded as a liability)

214

Cash and Receivables

with the receivables as security for the loan. The accounting treatment regarding the sale
of receivables using either standard is a complex topic; the discussion in this section is
intended as a basic overview.
Below are some different examples of sales of receivables; such as factoring and securitization.
Factoring
Factoring is when individual accounts receivable are sold or transferred to a recipient or
factor, usually a financial institution, in exchange for cash minus a fee called a discount.
The seller does not usually have any subsequent involvement with the receivable and
the factor collects directly from the customer. (Companies selling fitness equipment
exclusively use this method for all their credit sales to customers.)
The downside to this strategy is that factoring is expensive. Factors typically charge a 2%
to 3% fee when they buy the right to collect payments from customers. A 2% discount for
an invoice due in thirty days is the equivalent of a substantial 25% a year, and 3% is over
36% per year compared to the much lower interest rates charged by banks and finance
companies. Most companies are better off borrowing from their bank, if it is possible to
do so.
However, factors will often advance funds when more traditional banks will not. Even with
only a prospective order in hand from a customer, a business can turn to a factor to see if
it will assume or share the risk of the receivable. Without the factoring arrangement, the
business must take time to secure and collect the receivable; the factor offers a reduction
in additional effort and aggravation that may be worth the price of the fee paid to the factor.
There are risks associated with factoring receivables. Companies that intend to sell their
receivables to a factor need to check out the bank and customer references of any factor.
There have been cases where a factor has gone out of business, still owing the company
substantial amounts of money held back in reserve from receivables already paid up.
Factoring versus Borrowing: A Comparison
The difference between factoring and borrowing can be significant for a company that
wants to sell some or all of its receivables. Consider the following example:
Assume that on June 1, Cromwell Co. has $100,000 accounts receivable it wants to sell
to a factor that charges 10% as a financing fee. Below is the transaction recorded as a
sale of receivables compared to a secured note payable arrangement, starting with some
opening balances:

Note that the entry for a sale is straightforward with the receivables of $100,000 derecognized from the accounts and a decrease in retained earnings due to the loss reported
in net income. However, for a secured borrowing, a note payable of $90,000 is added
to the accounts as a liability, and the accounts receivable of $100,000 remains in the
accounts as security for the note payable. Referring to the journal entry above, in both
cases cash flow increased by $90,000, but for the secured borrowing, there is added
debt of $90,000, affecting Cromwell’s debt ratio and negatively impacting any restrictive
covenants Cromwell might have with other creditors. After the transaction, the debt-tototal assets ratio for Cromwell is 20% if the accounts receivable transaction meets the
criteria for a sale. The debt ratio worsens to 36% if the transaction does not meet the
criteria for a sale and is treated as a secured borrowing. This impact could motivate
managers to choose a sale for their receivables to shorten the credit-to-cash cycle, rather
than the borrowing alternative.
Sales without Recourse
For sales without recourse, all the risks and rewards (IFRS) as well as the control (ASPE)
have been transferred to the factor, and the company no longer has any involvement.
For example, assume that on August 1, Ashton Industries Ltd. factors $200,000 of accounts receivable with Savoy Trust Co., the factor, on a without-recourse basis. All the
risks, rewards, and control are transferred to the finance company, which charges an 8%
fee and withholds a further 4% of the accounts receivables for estimated returns and
allowances. The entry for Ashton is:

The accounting treatment will be the same for IFRS and ASPE since both sets of conditions (risks and rewards and control) have been met. If no returns and allowances are
given to customers owing the receivables, Ashton will recoup the $8,000 from the factor.
In turn, Savoy’s net income will be the $16,000 revenue reduced by any uncollectible
receivables, since it now has assumed the risks/rewards and control of these receivables.
Sales with Recourse
In this case, Ashton guarantees payment to Savoy for any uncollectible receivables (recourse obligation). Under IFRS, the guarantee means that the risks and rewards have
not been transferred to the factor, and the accounting treatment would be as a secured
borrowing as illustrated above in Cromwell—Note Payable. Under ASPE, if all three
conditions for treatment as a sale as described previously are met, the transaction can be
treated as a sale.
Continuing with the example for Ashton, assume that the receivables are sold with recourse, the company uses ASPE, and that all three conditions have been met. In addition
to the 8% fee and 4% withholding allowance, Savoy estimates that the recourse obligation has a fair value of $5,000. The entry for Ashton, including the estimated recourse
obligation is:

You will see that the recourse liability to Savoy results in an increase in the loss on sale
of receivables by the recourse liability amount of $5,000. If there were no uncollectible
receivables, Ashton will eliminate the recourse liability amount and decrease the loss.
Savoy’s net income will be the finance fee of $16,000 with no reductions in revenue due
to uncollectible accounts, since these are being guaranteed and assumed by Ashton.
Securitization
Securitization is a financing transaction that gives companies an alternative way to raise
funds other than by issuing debt, such as a corporate bond or note. The process is
extremely complex and the description below is a simplified version.
The receivables are sold to a holding company called a Special Purpose Entity (SPE),
which is sponsored by a financial intermediary. This is similar to factoring without re-

218

Cash and Receivables

course, but is done on a much larger scale. This sale of receivables and their removal
from the accounting records by the company holding the receivables is an example of offbalance sheet accounting. In its most basic form, the securitization process involves
two steps:
Step 1: A company (the asset originator) with receivables (e.g., auto loans, credit card
debt), identifies the receivables (assets) it wants to sell and remove from its balance
sheet. The company divides these into bundles, called tranches, each containing a
group of receivables with similar credit risks. Some bundles will contain the lowest risk
receivables (senior tranches) while other bundles will have the highest risk receivables
(junior tranches).
The company sells this portfolio of receivable bundles to a special purpose entity (SPE)
that was created by a financial intermediary specifically to purchase these types of portfolio assets. Once purchased, the originating company (seller) derecognizes the receivables and the SPE accounts for the portfolio assets in its own accounting records. In many
cases, the company that originally sold the portfolio of receivables to the SPE continues to
service the receivables in the portfolio, collects payments from the original borrowers and
passes them on—less a servicing fee—directly to the SPE. In other cases, the originating
company is no longer involved and the SPE engages a bank or financial intermediary to
collect the receivables as a collecting agent.
Step 2: The SPE (issuing agent) finances the purchase of the receivables portfolio from
the originating company by issuing tradeable interest-bearing securities that are secured
or backed by the receivables portfolio it now holds in its own accounting records as stated
in Step 1—hence the name asset-backed securities (ABS). These interest-bearing
ABS securities are sold to capital market investors who receive fixed or floating rate
payments from the SPE, funded by the cash flows generated by the portfolio collections.
To summarize, securitization represents an alternative and diversified source of financing
based on the transfer of credit risk (and possibly also interest rate and currency risk) from
the originating company and ultimately to the capital market investors.
The Downside of Securitization
Securitization is inherently complex, yet it has grown exponentially. The resulting highly
competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers (financial institutions and SPEs),
increase the risk that underwriting standards for the asset-backed securities could decline
and cause sharp drops in the bundled or tranched securities’ market values. This is
because both the investment return (principal and interest repayment) and losses are allocated among the various bundles according to their level of risk. The least risky bundles,
for example, have first call on the income generated by the underlying receivables assets,
while the riskiest bundles have last claim on that income, but receive the highest return.
Typically, investors with securities linked to the lowest-risk bundles would have little expectation of portfolio losses. However, because investors often finance their investment

6.3. Receivables

219

purchase by borrowing, they are very sensitive to changes in underlying receivables
assets’ quality. This sensitivity was the initial source of the problems experienced in
the sub-prime mortgage market (derivatives) meltdown in 2008. At that time, repayment
issues surfaced in the riskiest bundles due to the weakened underwriting standards, and
lack of confidence spread to investors holding even the lowest risk bundles, which caused
panic among investors and a flight into safer assets, resulting in a fire sale of securitized
debt of the SPEs.
In the future, securitized products are likely to become simpler. After years of posting
virtually no capital reserves against high-risk securitized debt, SPEs will soon be faced
with regulatory changes that will require higher capital charges and more comprehensive
valuations. Reviving securitization transactions and restoring investor confidence might
also require SPEs to retain an interest in the performance of securitized assets at each
level of risk (Jobst, 2008).

6.3.4 Disclosures of Receivables
The standards for receivables reporting and disclosures have been in a constant state
of change. IFRS 7 (IFRS, 2015) and IAS 1 (IAS, 2003) include significant disclosure
requirements that provide information based on significance and the nature and extent of
risks.
The Significance of Financial Instruments
IFRS 7 and IAS 1 specify the separate reporting categories based on significance such
as the following:

• Trade accounts, amounts owing from related parties, prepayments, tax refunds, and
other significant amounts
• Current amounts from non-current amounts
• Any impaired balances and amount of any allowance for credit risk and a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance account during the accounting period
• Disclosure on the income statement of the amounts of interest income, impairment
losses, and any reversals associated with impairment losses
• Net losses on sales of receivables (IFRS, 2015, 7.20 a, iv).

For each receivables category above, the following disclosures are required:

220

Cash and Receivables

• The carrying amounts such as amortized cost/cost and fair values (including methods used to estimate fair value) with details of any amounts reclassified from one
category to another or changes in fair values
• Carrying amount and terms and conditions regarding financial assets pledged as
collateral or any financial assets held as collateral
• An indication of the amounts and, where practicable, the maturity dates of accounts
with a maturity of more than one year
• For IFRS, extensive disclosures of major terms regarding the securitization or transfers of receivables, whether these have been derecognized in their entirety or not.
Some of these disclosures include the characteristics of the securitization, the fair
value measurements and methods used and cash flows, as well as the nature of the
servicing requirements and associated risks.

The Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial Instruments
Stakeholders, such as investors and creditors, want to know about the various transactions that hold risks. Basic types of risks and related disclosures are:

• Credit risk—the risk that one party to a financial instrument will default on its debt
obligation. Disclosures include an analysis of the age of financial assets that are
past due as at the end of the reporting period but not impaired and an analysis of
financial assets that are individually determined to be impaired as at the end of the
reporting period, including the factors the entity considered in determining that they
are impaired (IFRS 2015, 7.37 a, b).
• Liquidity risk—the risk that an entity will have difficulties in paying its financial liabilities.
• Market risk—the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a receivable will fluctuate
due to changes in market prices which are affected by interest rate risk, currency
risk, and other price risks. Disclosures include a sensitivity analysis for each type of
market risk to which the entity is exposed at the end of the reporting period, showing
how profit or loss and equity would have been affected by changes in the relevant
risk variable that were reasonably possible at that date (IFRS 2015, 7.40 a).

In addition, information about company policies for managing risk, including quantitative
and qualitative data, is to be disclosed. ASPE disclosure requirements are much the
same as IFRS, though perhaps requiring slightly less information about risk exposures
and fair values than IFRS (CPA Canada, 2016, Part II, Section 3856.38–42).

6.4. Cash and Receivables: Analysis

221

6.4 Cash and Receivables: Analysis
The most common analytical tool regarding cash is the statement of cash flows. This
statement reveals how a company spends its money (cash outflows) and where the money
comes from (cash inflows). It is well known that a company’s profitability, as shown by its
net income, is an important performance evaluator. Although accrual accounting provides
a basis for matching revenues and expenses, this system does not actually reflect the
amount of cash that the company has received from its profits. This can be a crucial
distinction as discussed earlier in this chapter. The statement of cash flows was discussed
in Chapter 4.
For receivables analysis, three key financial tools are:
• An accounts receivable aging report
• Trendline analysis
• Ratio analysis
Accounts Receivable Aging Report
One of the easiest methods for analyzing the state of a company’s accounts receivable is
to print an accounts receivable aging report, which is a standard report available in any
accounting software package. As was discussed earlier in this chapter, this report divides
the age of the accounts receivable into various groups according to the amount of time
uncollected. Any invoices uncollected for greater than 30 days are cause for increased
vigilance, especially if they drop into the oldest time grouping.
There are several issues to be aware of when analyzing accounts receivables based on
an aging report.
Individual credit terms—Management may have authorized unusually long credit terms
to specific customers, or for specific types of invoices. If so, these items may appear to
be severely overdue for payment when they are, in fact, not yet due for payment at all.
Distance from billing date—In many companies, most of the invoices are billed at the
end of the month. If an aging report is run a few days later as part of the month-end
analysis, it will likely still show outstanding accounts receivable from one month ago for
which payment is about to arrive, as well as the full amount of all the receivables that were
just billed a few days ago. In total, it appears that receivables are in a bad state. However,
if you were to run the report just prior to the month-end billing activities, there would be
far fewer accounts receivable in the report, and there may appear to be very little cash
coming from uncollected receivables.

222

Cash and Receivables

Time grouping size—The groupings should approximate the duration regarding the company’s credit terms. For example, if credit terms are just ten days and the first time
grouping spans 30 days, nearly all invoices will appear to be current.
Trendline Analysis
Another accounts receivable analysis tool is the trendline. If the outstanding accounts
receivable balance at the end of each month for the past year is graphed, it can be used
to predict the amount of receivables that should be outstanding in the near future. This
is a particularly valuable tool when sales are seasonal, since you can apply seasonal
variability to estimates of future sales levels.
Trendline analysis is also useful for comparing the percentage of bad debts to sales over
time. If there is a strong recurring trend in this percentage, management will likely take
action. As was discussed earlier, if the percentage of bad debt is increasing, management will likely authorize tighter credit terms to customers. Conversely, if the bad debt
percentage is extremely low, management may elect to loosen credit terms to expand
sales to somewhat more risky customers. Their philosophy will be that not all customers
in the riskier categories will default on paying their debts to suppliers so there should be a
net benefit from increasing sales. The bottom line is that the credit terms need to strike a
balance between the two opposites. Trendline analysis is a particularly useful tool when
you run the bad debt percentage analysis for individual customers, since it can spotlight
problems that may indicate the possible bankruptcy of a customer.
There are two issues to be aware of when you use trendline analysis:

• Change in credit policy. If management has authorized a change in the credit
policy, it can lead to sudden changes in accounts receivable or bad debt levels.
• Change in products or business lines. If a company adds to or deletes from its
mix of products or business lines, it may cause profound changes in the trend of
accounts receivable.

An interesting analysis related to accounts receivable is a trendline of the proportion of
customer sales that are paid at the time of sale, noting the payment type used. Changes in
a company’s selling procedures and policies may shift sales toward or away from up-front
payments, which therefore has an impact on the amount and characteristics of accounts
receivable.
Ratio Analysis
A third type of accounts receivable analysis is ratio analysis. Ratios, on their own, do not
really tell the whole story. Ratios compared to a benchmark, such as an industry sector

6.4. Cash and Receivables: Analysis

or previous period trends will be more meaningful. Some of the more common ratios that
include cash and accounts receivable are:

• Quick or acid-test ratio, which measures immediate debt-paying ability
• Accounts receivable turnover, which measures how quickly the receivables are converted into cash
• Days’ sales uncollected, which measures the number of days that receivables remain uncollected

These are examples of liquidity ratios which measure a company’s ability to pay its debts
as they come due. Below is selected financial data for Best Coffee and Donuts:

Quick ratio
The quick or acid-test ratio, measures only the most liquid current assets available to
cover its current liabilities. The quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio
which includes all current assets and current liabilities because it excludes inventory and
any other current assets that are not highly liquid.
Formula:

Quick Ratio =

Cash & cash equivalents + short-term investments + current receivables
Current liabilities

Calculation:
2016
Quick Ratio =

$50,414+$210,664+$4,631
$586,216

2015
= .45

$120,139+$171,605+$7,531
$463,372

= .65

As of December 31, 2016, with amounts expressed in thousands, Best Coffee and Donuts’
quick current assets amounted to $265,709, while current liabilities amounted to $586,216.
The resulting ratio produced is .45. This means that there is $.45 of the most liquid current
assets available for each $1.00 of current liabilities. If a quick ratio of greater than $1.00
is a reasonable measure of liquidity, this means that Best Coffee and Donuts’ ability to
cover its current liabilities as they mature is at risk. Moreover, this ratio has weakened
compared to the previous year of .65 or $.65 for each $1.00 in current liabilities.
Variations

6.4. Cash and Receivables: Analysis

225

In practice, some presentations of the quick ratio calculate quick assets (the formula’s
numerator) as simply the total current assets minus the inventory account. This is quicker
and easier to calculate. By excluding a relatively less-liquid account such as inventory, it
is thought that the remaining current assets will be of the more-liquid variety.
Using Best Coffee and Donuts as an example, for 2016, the quick ratio using the shorter
calculation would be:

Quick ratio =

$574,989 − $104,326
= .80
$586,216

It is clear from the comparative calculations that .80 is significantly higher than the previously calculated .45 ratio. Restricted cash, prepaid expenses, and deferred income taxes
do not pass the test of truly liquid assets. Thus, using the shorter calculation artificially
overstates Best Coffee and Donuts more-liquid current assets and inflates its quick ratio.
For this reason, it is not advisable to rely on this abbreviated version of the quick ratio.
Another type of analysis is to compare the quick ratio with its corresponding current ratio.
If the current ratio is significantly higher, it is a clear indication that the company’s current
assets are dependent on inventory and other “less than liquid” current assets, such as
legally restricted cash balances.
Even though the quick ratio is a more conservative measure of liquidity than the current
ratio, they both share the same problems regarding the time it takes to convert accounts
receivables to cash in that they assume a liquidation of accounts receivable as the basis
for measuring liquidity. In truth, a company must focus on the time it takes to convert its
working capital assets to cash—that is the true measure of liquidity. This is the credit-tocash cycle emphasized throughout this chapter. So, if a company’s accounts receivable,
has a much longer conversion time than a typical credit policy of thirty days, the quickness
attribute of this ratio becomes a focal point. For this reason, investors and creditors need
to be aware that relying solely on the current and quick ratios as indicators of a company’s
liquidity can be misleading. The “quickness” attribute will be discussed next.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
The accounts receivable turnover ratio measures the number of times per year on average
that it takes to collect a company’s receivables. When using this ratio for analysis, the
following issues must be considered:

• Credit sales, rather than all sales, would be the better measure to use for the
numerator, but this information can be more difficult to obtain by third parties such
as prospective investors and creditors, so total sales are often used in practice.

226

Cash and Receivables

• Typically, average receivables outstanding are usually calculated from the beginning
and ending balances. However, if a business has significant seasonal cycles, calculating a series of turnover averages throughout the fiscal year, such as semi-annually
or quarterly, will likely provide better results.
• Companies can choose to sell their receivables making comparability with other
companies not suitable.
• Net accounts receivable includes the allowance for doubtful accounts (AFDA), so
the choice of what method and rates to use when estimating uncollectible accounts
can vary significantly between companies, resulting in invalid comparisons.

The key consideration is to ensure comparability and consistency when interpreting
ratio analysis, since ratios are used to determine favourable or unfavourable trends resulting from comparison to other factors. Using Best Coffee and Donuts data, we calculate
the following:
Formula:

A/R turnover =

Net credit sales (or net sales, if unavailable)
Average net accounts receivable

Calculation for 2016:

$3,255,533
($210,664 + 171,605) ÷ 2
= 17.03 times or every 21.43 days on average (365/17.03 = 21.43)

A/R turnover =

If the industry standard or the company credit policy is n/30 days, an accounts receivable
turnover of every twenty-one days on average would be a favourable outcome compared
to the thirty-day due date set by the company’s credit policy. Aging schedules would
provide further information about the quality of specific receivables and would highlight
any customer accounts that were overdue and requiring immediate attention.
Days’ sales uncollected
This ratio estimates how many days it takes to collect on the current receivables outstanding.
Formula:

Calculation for 2016:

Days’ sales uncollected =



× 365 = 23.62 days

Note that the average receivables are not used in this calculation. This means that
the ratio measures the collectability of the current accounts receivables instead of the
average accounts receivable. If a guideline for this ratio is that it should not exceed 1.33
times its credit period when no discount is offered (or the discount period if a discount is
offered), 23.62 days compared to the benchmark of forty days (30 days × 1.33) means
that the ratio is favourable.
The best way to analyze accounts receivable is to use all three techniques. The accounts
receivable collection period can be used to get a general idea of the ability of a company
to collect its accounts receivable, add an analysis of the aging report to determine exactly
which invoices are causing collection problems, and add trend analysis to see if these
problems have been changing over time.

6.6 Appendix A: Review of Internal Controls, Petty
Cash, and Bank Reconciliations
Internal Control
Assets are the lifeblood of a company and must be protected. This duty falls to managers
of a company. The policies and procedures implemented by management to protect assets are collectively referred to as internal controls. An effective internal control program
not only protects assets, but also aids in accurate record-keeping, produces financial
statement information in a timely manner, ensures compliance with laws and regulations,
and promotes efficient operations. Effective internal control procedures ensure that adequate records are maintained, transactions are authorized, duties among employees are
divided between record-keeping functions and control of assets, and employees’ work is
checked by others. The use of electronic recordkeeping systems does not decrease the
need for good internal controls.

6.6. Appendix A: Review of Internal Controls, Petty Cash, and Bank Reconciliations

231

The effectiveness of internal controls is limited by human error and fraud. Human error
can occur because of negligence or mistakes. Fraud is the intentional decision to circumvent internal control systems for personal gain. Sometimes, employees cooperate
with each other to avoid internal controls. This collusion is often difficult to detect, but
fortunately, it is not a common occurrence when adequate controls are in place.
Internal controls take many forms. Some are broadly based, like mandatory employee
drug testing, video surveillance, and scrutiny of company email systems. Others are
specific to an asset type or process. For instance, internal controls need to be applied
to a company’s accounting system to ensure that transactions are processed efficiently
and correctly to produce reliable records in a timely manner. Procedures should be
documented to promote good recordkeeping, and employees need to be trained in the
application of internal control procedures.
Financial statements prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles are
useful not only to external users in evaluating the financial performance and financial
position of the company, but also for internal decision making. There are various internal
control mechanisms that aid in the production of timely and useful financial information.
For instance, using a chart of accounts is necessary to ensure transactions are recorded
in the appropriate account. As an example, expenses are classified and recorded in
applicable expense accounts, then summarized and evaluated against those of a prior
year.
The design of accounting records and documents is another important means to provide
financial information. Financial data is entered and summarized in records and transmitted by documents. A good system of internal control requires that these records and
documents be prepared at the time a transaction takes place or as soon as possible
afterwards, since they become less credible and the possibility of error increases with the
passage of time. The documents should also be consecutively pre-numbered, to indicate
whether there may be missing documents.
Internal control also promotes the protection of assets. Cash is particularly vulnerable to
misuse. A good system of internal control for cash should provide adequate procedures
for protecting cash receipts and cash payments (commonly referred to as cash disbursements). Procedures to achieve control over cash vary from company to company and
depend upon such variables as company size, number of employees, and cash sources.
However, effective cash control generally requires the following:

• Separation of duties: People responsible for handling cash should not be responsible for maintaining cash records. By separating the custodial and record-keeping
duties, theft of cash is less likely.
• Same-day deposits: All cash receipts should be deposited daily in the company’s
bank account. This prevents theft and personal use of the money before deposit.

232

Cash and Receivables

• Payments made using non-cash means: Cheques or electronic funds transfer (EFT)
provide a separate external record to verify cash disbursements. For example, many
businesses pay their employees using electronic funds transfer because it is more
secure and efficient than using cash or even cheques.

Two forms of internal control over cash will be discussed in this chapter: the use of a petty
cash account and the preparation of bank reconciliations.

Petty Cash
The payment of small amounts by cheque may be inconvenient and costly. For example,
using cash to pay for postage on an incoming package might be less than the total
processing cost of a cheque. A small amount of cash kept on hand to pay for small,
infrequent expenses is referred to as a petty cash fund.

Establishing and Reimbursing the Petty Cash Fund
To set up the petty cash fund, a cheque is issued for the amount needed. The custodian
of the fund cashes the cheque and places the coins and currency in a locked box.
Responsibility for the petty cash fund should be delegated to only one person, who
should be held accountable for its contents. Cash payments are made by this petty cash
custodian out of the fund as required when supported by receipts. When the amount of
cash has been reduced to a pre-determined level, the receipts are compiled and submitted
for entry into the accounting system. A cheque is issued to reimburse the petty cash fund.
At any given time, the petty cash amount should consist of cash and supporting receipts,
that total to the petty cash fund amount. To demonstrate the management of a petty cash
fund, assume that a $200 cheque is issued to establish a petty cash fund.

The petty cash receipts should be cancelled at the time of reimbursement to prevent
their reuse for duplicate reimbursements. The petty cash custodian cashes the $190
cheque. The $190 plus the $10 of coin and currency in the locked box immediately prior
to reimbursement equals the $200 total required in the petty cash fund.
Sometimes, the receipts plus the coin and currency in the petty cash locked box do not
equal the required petty cash balance. To demonstrate, assume the same information
above except that the coin and currency remaining in the petty cash locked box was $8.
This amount plus the receipts for $190 equals $198 and not $200, indicating a shortage
in the petty cash box. The entry at the time of reimbursement reflects the shortage and is

What happens if the petty cash custodian finds that the fund is rarely used? In such a
case, the size of the fund should be decreased to reduce the risk of theft. To demonstrate,
assume the petty cash custodian has receipts totalling $110 and $90 in coin and currency
remaining in the petty cash box. The receipts consist of the following: delivery charges
$80 and postage $30. The petty cash custodian submits the receipts to the accountant
and requests that the petty cash fund be reduced by $75. The following entry is recorded
and a cheque for $35 is issued.

In cases when the size of the petty cash fund is too small, the petty cash custodian could
request an increase in the size of the petty cash fund at the time of reimbursement. Care
should be taken to ensure that the size of the petty cash fund is not so large as to become
a potential theft issue. Additionally, if a petty cash fund is too large, it may be an indicator
that transactions that should be paid by cheque are not being processed in accordance
with company policy. Remember that the purpose of the petty cash fund is to pay for
infrequent expenses; day-to-day items should not go through petty cash.

6.6. Appendix A: Review of Internal Controls, Petty Cash, and Bank Reconciliations

Cash Collections and Payments
The widespread use of banks facilitates cash transactions between entities and provides a
safeguard for the cash assets being exchanged. This involvement of banks as intermediaries between entities has accounting implications. At any point in time, the cash balance
in the accounting records of a company usually differs from the bank cash balance. The
difference is usually because some cash transactions recorded in the accounting records
have not yet been recorded by the bank and, conversely, some cash transactions recorded
by the bank have not yet been recorded in the company’s accounting records.
The use of a bank reconciliation is one method of internal control over cash. The reconciliation process brings into agreement the company’s accounting records for cash and
the bank statement issued by the company’s bank. A bank reconciliation explains the
difference between the balances reported by the company and by the bank on a given
date.
A bank reconciliation proves the accuracy of both the company’s and the bank’s records,
and reveals any errors made by either party. The bank reconciliation is a tool that can
help detect attempts at theft and manipulation of records. The preparation of a bank
reconciliation is discussed in the following section.

The Bank Reconciliation Process
The bank reconciliation is a report prepared by a company at a point in time. It identifies
discrepancies between the cash balance reported on the bank statement and the cash
balance reported in a business’s Cash account in the general ledger, more commonly
referred to as the books. These discrepancies are known as reconciling items and are
added or subtracted to either the book balance or bank balance of cash. Each of the
reconciling items is added or subtracted to the business’s cash balance. The business’s
cash balance will change as a result of the reconciling items. The cash balance prior
to reconciliation is called the unreconciled cash balance. The balance after adding and
subtracting the reconciling items is called the reconciled cash balance. The following is a
list of potential reconciling items and their impact on the bank reconciliation.
Book reconciling items
Collection of notes receivable (added)
NSF cheques (subtracted)
Bank charges (subtracted)
Book errors (added or subtracted,
depending on the nature of the error

Bank reconciling items
Outstanding deposits (added)

Bank errors (added or subtracted,
depending on the nature of the error)

236

Cash and Receivables

Book Reconciling Items
The collection of notes receivable may be made by a bank on behalf of the company.
These collections are often unknown to the company until they appear as an addition on
the bank statement, and so cause the general ledger cash account to be understated. As
a result, the collection of a notes receivable is added to the unreconciled book balance of
cash on the bank reconciliation.
Cheques returned to the bank because there were not sufficient funds (NSF) to cover
them appear on the bank statement as a reduction of cash. The company must then
request that the customer pay the amount again. As a result, the general ledger cash
account is overstated by the amount of the NSF cheque. NSF cheques must therefore
be subtracted from the unreconciled book balance of cash on the bank reconciliation to
reconcile cash.
Cheques received by a company and deposited into its bank account may be returned
by the customer’s bank for many reasons (e.g., the cheque was issued too long ago,
known as a stale-dated cheque, an unsigned or illegible cheque, or the cheque shows the
wrong account number). Returned cheques cause the general ledger cash account to be
overstated. These cheques are therefore subtracted on the bank statement, and must be
deducted from the unreconciled book balance of cash on the bank reconciliation.
Bank service charges are deducted from the customer’s bank account. Since the service
charges have not yet been recorded by the company, the general ledger cash account
is overstated. Therefore, service charges are subtracted from the unreconciled book
balance of cash on the bank reconciliation.
A business may incorrectly record journal entries involving cash. For instance, a deposit
or cheque may be recorded for the wrong amount in the company records. These errors
are often detected when amounts recorded by the company are compared to the bank
statement. Depending on the nature of the error, it will be either added to or subtracted
from the unreconciled book balance of cash on the bank reconciliation. For example, if the
company recorded a cheque as $520 when the correct amount of the cheque was $250,
the $270 difference would be added to the unreconciled book balance of cash on the bank
reconciliation. Why? Because the cash balance reported on the books is understated
by $270 because of the error. As another example, if the company recorded a deposit
as $520 when the correct amount of the deposit was $250, the $270 difference would
be subtracted from the unreconciled book balance of cash on the bank reconciliation.
Why? Because the cash balance reported on the books is overstated by $270 because
of the error. Each error requires careful analysis to determine whether it will be added or
subtracted in the unreconciled book balance of cash on the bank reconciliation.

6.6. Appendix A: Review of Internal Controls, Petty Cash, and Bank Reconciliations

237

Bank Reconciling Items
Cash receipts are recorded as an increase of cash in the company’s accounting records
when they are received. These cash receipts are deposited by the company into its bank.
The bank records an increase in cash only when these amounts are actually deposited
with the bank. Since not all cash receipts recorded by the company will have been
recorded by the bank when the bank statement is prepared, there will be outstanding
deposits, also known as deposits in transit. Outstanding deposits cause the bank
statement cash balance to be understated. Therefore, outstanding deposits are a reconciling item that must be added to the unreconciled bank balance of cash on the bank
reconciliation.
On the date that a cheque is prepared by a company, it is recorded as a reduction of cash
in a company’s books. A bank statement will not record a cash reduction until a cheque
is presented and accepted for payment (or clears the bank). Cheques that are recorded
in the company’s books but are not paid out of its bank account when the bank statement
is prepared are referred to as outstanding cheques. Outstanding cheques mean that
the bank statement cash balance is overstated. Therefore, outstanding cheques are a
reconciling item that must be subtracted from the unreconciled bank balance of cash on
the bank reconciliation.
Bank errors sometimes occur and are not revealed until the transactions on the bank
statement are compared to the company’s accounting records. When an error is identified,
the company notifies the bank to have it corrected. Depending on the nature of the error,
it is either added to or subtracted from the unreconciled bank balance of cash on the
bank reconciliation. For example, if the bank cleared a cheque as $520 that was correctly
written for $250, the $270 difference would be added to the unreconciled bank balance of
cash on the bank reconciliation. Why? Because the cash balance reported on the bank
statement is understated by $270 as a result of this error. As another example, if the bank
recorded a deposit as $520 when the correct amount was $250, the $270 difference would
be subtracted from the unreconciled bank balance of cash on the bank reconciliation.
Why? Because the cash balance reported on the bank statement is overstated by $270
because of this specific error. Each error must be carefully analyzed to determine how it
will be treated on the bank reconciliation.

Illustrative Problem—Bank Reconciliation
Assume that a bank reconciliation is prepared by Big Dog Carworks Corp. (BDCC) at
April 30. At this date, the Cash account in the general ledger shows a balance of $21,929
and includes the cash receipts and payments shown in Figure 6.1.

Figure 6.2: The Bank Reconciliation Process

For each entry in BDCC’s general ledger Cash account, there should be a matching entry
on its bank statement. Items in the general ledger Cash account but not on the bank
statement must be reported as a reconciling item on the bank reconciliation. For each
entry on the bank statement, there should be a matching entry in BDCC’s general ledger
Cash account. Items on the bank statement but not in the general ledger Cash account
must be reported as a reconciling item on the bank reconciliation.
There are nine steps to follow in preparing a bank reconciliation for BDCC at April 30,
2015:

240

Cash and Receivables

Step 1
Identify the ending general ledger cash balance ($21,929 from Figure 6.1) and list it on
the bank reconciliation as the book balance on April 30 as shown in Figure 6.3. This
represents the unreconciled book balance.
Step 2
Identify the ending cash balance on the bank statement ($24,023 from Figure 6.2) and
list it on the bank reconciliation as the bank statement balance on April 30 as shown in
Figure 6.3. This represents the unreconciled bank balance.
Step 3
Cheques written that have cleared the bank are returned with the bank statement. These
cheques are said to be cancelled because, once cleared, the bank marks them to prevent
them from being used again. Cancelled cheques are compared to the company’s list of
cash payments. Outstanding cheques are identified using two steps:
a. Any outstanding cheques listed on the BDCC’s March 31 bank reconciliation are
compared to the cheques listed on the April 30 bank statement.
For BDCC, all of the March outstanding cheques (nos. 580, 599, and 600) were
paid by the bank in April. Therefore, there are no reconciling items to include in the
April 30 bank reconciliation. If one of the March outstanding cheques had not been
paid by the bank in April, it would be subtracted as an outstanding cheque from the
unreconciled bank balance on the bank reconciliation.
b. The cash payments listed in BDCC’s accounting records are compared to the cheques
on the bank statement. This comparison indicates that the following cheques are
outstanding.
Cheque No.

607
608
609
610

Amount
$ 287
1,364
100
40
1,520

Outstanding cheques must be deducted from the bank statement’s unreconciled
ending cash balance of $24,023 as shown in Figure 6.3.
Step 4
Other payments made by the bank are identified on the bank statement and subtracted
from the unreconciled book balance on the bank reconciliation.

6.6. Appendix A: Review of Internal Controls, Petty Cash, and Bank Reconciliations

241

a. An examination of the April bank statement shows that the bank had deducted the
NSF cheque of John Donne for $180. This is deducted from the unreconciled book
balance on the bank reconciliation as shown in Figure 6.3.
b. An examination of the April 30 bank statement shows that the bank had also deducted a service charge of $6 during April. This amount is deducted from the
unreconciled book balance on the bank reconciliation as shown in Figure 6.3.

Step 5
Last month’s bank reconciliation is reviewed for outstanding deposits at March 31. There
were no outstanding deposits at March 31. If there had been, the amount would have
been added to the unreconciled bank balance on the bank reconciliation.
Step 6
The deposits shown on the bank statement are compared with the amounts recorded in
the company records. This comparison indicates that the April 30 cash receipt amounting
to $1,000 was deposited but it is not included in the bank statement. The outstanding
deposit is added to the unreconciled bank balance on the bank reconciliation as shown in
Figure 6.3.
Step 7
Any errors in the company’s records or in the bank statement must be identified and
reported on the bank reconciliation.
An examination of the April bank statement shows that the bank deducted a cheque
issued by another company for $31 from the BDCC bank account in error. Assume that
when notified, the bank indicated it would make a correction in May’s bank statement.
The cheque deducted in error must be added to the bank statement balance on the bank
reconciliation as shown in Figure 6.3.
Step 8
Total both sides of the bank reconciliation. The result must be that the book balance
and the bank statement balance are equal or reconciled. These balances represent the
adjusted balance.
The bank reconciliation in Figure 6.3 is the result of completing the preceding eight steps.

These balances must agree.

Reconciling items in this section require
journal entries to be made in the general
journal to correct the unreconciled Cash
balance of $21,929 in the general ledger
to the reconciled balance of $21,743.

Reconciling items in this section do
not require journal entries because
the outstanding deposits and cheques
should clear the bank next month, in
May. Additionally, the other reconciling
items (e.g., the $31 cheque deducted in
error) must be reported to the bank so it
can make the necessary corrections to
Big Dog’s account in the next month.

Step 9
For the adjusted balance calculated in the bank reconciliation to appear in the accounting
records, an adjusting entry(s) must be prepared.
The adjusting entry(s) is based on the reconciling item(s) used to calculate the adjusted
book balance. The book balance side of BDCC’s April 30 bank reconciliation is copied to

Note that the balance of $21,743 in the general ledger Cash account is the same as the
adjusted book balance of $21,743 on the bank reconciliation. Big Dog does not make any
adjusting entries for the reconciling items on the bank side of the bank reconciliation since
these will eventually clear the bank and appear on a later bank statement. Bank errors
will be corrected by the bank.

Cash and Receivables

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe cash and receivables, and explain their role in
accounting and business.
Companies usually have significant amounts of accounts receivable and the time frame
and effort required to convert receivables to cash is a cycle that calls for regular monitoring for which financial reporting plays a significant role. Cash and receivables are
financial assets defined as cash or a contractual right to receive cash or another financial
asset from another entity. Cash and receivables are also monetary assets because they
represent a claim to cash where the amount is fixed by contract.
Cash and receivables need to be kept in balance for the company to be financially stable.
Too many accounts receivable may mean a substandard credit policy, resulting in significant uncollectible accounts. Too few accounts receivable could be an indication that the
company’s credit policy is too restrictive, resulting in missed sales opportunities. Effective
cash management is essential to ensure that any surplus cash is invested appropriately
to maximize interest income and to minimize any bank loans and other borrowings.

LO 2: Describe cash and cash equivalents, and explain how they are
measured and reported.
Cash is the most liquid asset and if unrestricted is usually classified as a current asset.
Cash consists of coins, currency, bank accounts and petty cash funds, and negotiable
instruments such as money orders, cheques, and bank drafts. Temporary same-bank
overdrafts are usually netted with the current cash balance. Foreign currencies are
reported in Canadian dollars as at the balance sheet date. Cash balances set aside
for long-term purposes, such as a plant expansion project or long-term debt retirement,
are classified long-term assets. Legally restricted or compensating balances are reported
separately as current or non-current assets depending on the classification of the account
it is supporting.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid assets with maturities no longer than three
months (or ninety days) at acquisition that can be converted into known amounts of cash.
Cash equivalents are usually combined with cash and reported in a single cash and cash
equivalents account on the balance sheet. Examples are treasury bills, money market
funds, short-term notes receivable, and guaranteed investment certificates (GICs).

Chapter Summary

245

LO 3: Describe receivables, identify the different types of
receivables, explain their accounting treatment, and prepare the
relevant journal entries.
Receivables are claims held against customers and debtors that are contractual rights
with a legal claim to receive cash or other financial assets. They can be classified
as current or long-term and are initially reported at their fair value. Subsequently they
are measured at amortized cost. Categories include trade (accounts) receivable, notes
receivable, and non-trade receivables.
Accounts receivable are usually collected within one year, so the interest component is not
significant. Measurement in lieu of fair value is net realizable value. This is equivalent
to the transaction value on the date the credit sale initially occurred and adjusted by
any trade or sales discounts, sales returns, and allowances. Subsequent measurement
is at cost (in lieu of amortized cost, since there is no interest component to amortize).
Accounts receivable are affected by credit risk which may result in impairment of the
accounts thereby reducing their net realizable value. This requires estimating an amount
for uncollectible accounts that can be recorded to a valuation account called an allowance
for doubtful accounts (AFDA). The AFDA is a contra account to accounts receivable and
the net of the two accounts is intended to reflect the accounts receivable’s net realizable
value. The calculations to estimate uncollectible accounts will be completed at each reporting date using either a percentage of accounts receivable, percentages applied to the
accounts receivable aging report, a percentage of credit sales, or a mix of these methods.
Whenever an actual account is deemed uncollectible, it is written-off by removing it from
the accounts receivables and AFDA accounts.
Notes receivable are a written promise to pay a specific sum of money on demand or on a
defined future date. Payments can be a single lump sum at maturity, a series of payments,
or a combination of both. Notes may be referred to as interest bearing or non-interestbearing, even though there is always an interest component that must be recognized. For
interest-bearing notes, the interest paid is equal to the stated interest rate on the note.
For non-interest-bearing notes, the interest paid is the difference between the amount
lent (proceeds) and the (higher) amount paid at maturity. Notes may be classified as
short-term (less than twelve months) or long-term. Notes are initially measured at their
fair value including transaction fees on the date that the note is legally executed. For
short-term notes, since the effects of the discounted cash flows are insignificant, the net
realizable value is used to approximate fair value. For long-term notes, fair value is equal
to the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted by the market rate at
the time of note issuance. After issuance, long-term notes receivable are measured at
amortized cost, which allocates the interest income and discount or premium, if any, over
the term of the note. For ASPE, either the effective interest rate method or the straightline method can be used for amortization purposes. For IFRS, the effective interest rate
method is to be used.

246

Cash and Receivables

Non-trade receivables are amounts due for item such as income tax refunds, GST/HST
receivable, amounts due from the sale of assets, insurance claims, advances to employees, amounts due from officers of the company, or dividends receivable.
To shorten the cycle of receivables to cash, companies can arrange for a borrowing (loan)
from a financial institution (using the receivables as collateral) or as a sale of the receivables to another entity for cash. Sales can be either factoring or securitization. Factoring
involves a financial intermediary (factor), such as a finance company that purchases the
receivables and collects from the customers. Securitization is more complex; it involves
a special purpose entity or vehicle (SPV) set up by a financial institution that purchases
the receivables from the transferor using proceeds obtained from selling debt instruments
to investors. These debt instruments are secured by the receivables received from the
transferor. Companies selling receivables may or may not have continuing involvement
regarding the transferred receivables. The issue becomes whether the transfer should be
treated as a secured borrowing or a sale. For IFRS, receivables are treated as a sale
if the risks and rewards have substantially been transferred. This is evidenced by the
contractual rights to cash flows being transferred or the company continues to collect but
immediately passes the proceeds on to the entity that purchased the receivables. As well,
the company cannot sell or pledge the receivables to any other party. For ASPE, the focus
is on control of the receivables. Three conditions must be met for control to occur and for
receivables to be treated as a sale.
IFRS disclosures of receivables involve levels of significance and the nature and extent
of the risks arising from them and how these risks are managed. Separate reporting is
required for:

• trade accounts receivable from non-trade accounts
• current accounts receivable from non-current
• disclosures of any impairments or reversals of impairments
• details regarding any allowance accounts.

Other disclosures require details about the carrying amounts such as fair values, amortized costs or costs where applicable, and methods used for estimating uncollectible
accounts. For long-term receivables, the amounts and maturity dates are to be disclosed.
Information about any assets pledged or held as collateral is to be disclosed. Extensive
disclosures are required for any securitization or transfers of receivables. Various types of
risks such as credit, liquidity and market risks are to be disclosed. Companies following
ASPE require less disclosure than IFRS companies.

LO 4: Identify the different methods used to analyze cash and
receivables.
Cash and receivables are analyzed using various techniques to determine the levels
of risk for uncollectible accounts as well as the company’s overall liquidity or solvency.
The statement of cash flows provides information about the sources and uses of cash.
Receivables can be analyzed using accounts receivable aging reports, trendline analysis,
and various ratio analyses such as quick and current ratios, accounts receivable turnover
ratios, and days’ sales uncollected.

LO 5: Explain the differences between IFRS and ASPE for
recognition, measurement, and reporting for cash and receivables.
For the most part, the IFRS and ASPE standards are similar. The differences between
IFRS and ASPE arise regarding: 1) what is recognized as cash equivalents; 2) the method
used to amortize interest, premiums, or discounts for long-term receivables; 3) the criteria
needed for treatment as either a sale of receivables or as a secured borrowing; and 4)
both the nature and extent of disclosing requirements for cash and receivables on the
balance sheet.

Chapter 7
Inventory

Too Much Inventory
BlackBerry Ltd. faced a rough week in late September 2013. Within a seven-day
period, the company not only announced a potential buyer for the company but
also reported a quarterly loss of close to a billion dollars. The loss was generated
primarily by write-down of BlackBerry 10 handsets (BB 10), the company’s new
flagship product. Prior to this result, the company had been struggling to keep up with
other smartphone competitors, and sales of the new phone had not met expectations.
As a result of the news reported during this week, the company’s share price fell over
20 percent on the market.
When the company reported its annual financial results for the year ended March 1,
2014, the gross profit on hardware sales was actually negative. In fact, it was – $2.5
billion. How can a company report a negative gross profit? In BlackBerry’s case, a
further write-down of the BB 10 handset occurred in the third quarter, resulting in total
write-downs for the year of approximately $2.4 billion. As described in the company’s
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition report, evaluations of
inventory require an assessment of future demand assumptions (BlackBerry Ltd.,
2014). Sales of the new BlackBerry product were significantly lower than expected,
resulting in a large number of unsold handsets. As the goal of financial reporting
is to portray the economic truth of a company, BlackBerry Ltd. had no choice but to
accept the reality that their inventory of BB 10 phones could not be sold for the amount
reported on the balance sheet. The company described the causes of the write-down
as these: the maturing smartphone market, very intense competition, and uncertainty
created by the company’s strategic review process.
Regardless of the causes, it was clear that this massive write-down had a profound
effect on BlackBerry Ltd.’s financial results and share price. Although the write-down
was a symptom of other deeper problems in the company, it is clear that management
of inventory levels can be a significant issue for many businesses. For the accountant,
understanding the importance of the reported inventory amount is paramount, and
critically analyzing the valuation assumptions is essential to fair reporting of inventory
balances.

Introduction
The nature of economic activity has been evolving rapidly over the last two decades. The
knowledge economy is becoming an increasingly significant component of the world’s
gross domestic product. But even in the wired world of services and data, there is always
a need for physical products. The concept of retail business may be changing through
the development of online shopping, but consumers still expect to receive their goods
eventually. This chapter will deal with some accounting issues surrounding the acquisition,
production, and sale of inventory items, and it will discuss some of the problems that can
arise when errors are made in the recording of inventory items.

Key Differences

7.1 Definition
IFRS defines inventories as assets that are:

• held for sale in the ordinary course of business,
• in the process of production for such sale, and
• in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in
the rendering of services (International Accounting Standards, n.d., 2.6).

The key feature of inventory is that it is held for sale in the normal course of business,
which differentiates it from other tangible assets, such as property, plant, and equipment,
that are only sold only when their productive capacity is exhausted or no longer required

262

Inventory

by the business. The definition also recognizes that for manufacturing businesses, inventory can take various forms throughout the production process. Raw materials, work in
process, and finished goods are all considered inventory. For many businesses, inventory
can represent a significant asset. In 2013, Bombardier Inc., a manufacturer of airplanes
and trains, reported total inventory of $8.2 billion, which represented over 28 percent of
the company’s total assets. In the same year, Loblaw Companies Ltd., a grocery retailer,
reported total inventory of over $2 billion.
It is not surprising that, given its significance, inventory can also be the source of various types of accounting problems. In 2014, BlackBerry had to write off approximately
$2.4 billion of its inventory due to slow sales resulting from competitive pressures. In
a more troubling series of events, inventories of DHB Industries Inc., a manufacturer of
body armour for the military and police, were overstated by approximately $47 million
in 2004. The accounting errors included the falsification of amounts included in work in
process, and raw materials and a failure to write off significant amounts of obsolete raw
materials. These accounting errors led to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
investigation and penalties.

7.2 Initial Recognition and Measurement
An obvious question that arises when considering inventory is, what costs should be
included? In answering this question, IFRS has provided some general guidance: the
cost of inventories shall include all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and “other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition” (International
Accounting Standards, n.d., 2.10).
Costs of Purchase
Purchase costs include not only the direct purchase price of the goods but also the costs
to transport the goods to the company’s premises and any nonrecoverable taxes or import
duties paid on the purchase. As well, any discounts or rebates earned on the purchase
should be deducted from the cost of the inventory.
One issue that often needs to be considered when determining inventory costs at the end
of an accounting period is the matter of goods in transit. Goods may be shipped by a
seller before the end of an accounting period but are not received until after the end of
the purchaser’s accounting period. The question of who owns the goods while they are
in transit obviously needs to be addressed. More specifically, three issues arise from this
question:

1. Who pays for the shipping costs?

7.2. Initial Recognition and Measurement

263

2. Who is responsible for the loss if goods are damaged in transit?
3. When should the transfer of ownership be recorded in the accounting records?

To answer these questions, the legal term free on board (FOB) needs to be understood.
When goods are shipped by a seller, the invoice will usually indicate that the goods are
shipped either FOB shipping or FOB destination. If the goods are FOB shipping, the
purchaser is assuming legal title as soon as the goods leave the seller’s warehouse.
This means the purchaser is responsible for shipping costs as well as for any damage
that occurs in transit. As well, the purchaser should record these goods in his or her
inventory accounts as soon as they are shipped, even if they don’t arrive until after the
end of the accounting period. If the goods are FOB destination, the purchaser is not
assuming ownership of the goods until they are received. This means that the seller
would be responsible for shipping costs and any damage that occurs in transit. As well,
the purchaser should not include these goods in his or her inventory until they are actually
received. Likewise, the seller would still include the goods in his or her inventory until they
are actually delivered to the purchaser. Accountants and auditors pay close attention to
the FOB terms of purchases and sales near the fiscal period end, as these terms can
affect the accurate recording of the inventory amount on the balance sheet.
Costs of Conversion
Another more complex issue arises in the determination of the cost of manufactured inventories. As noted above, IAS 2-10 requires the inclusion of costs to convert inventories into
their current form. For a manufacturing company, this means that inventories will include
raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. For raw materials, the cost is fairly
easy to determine. However, for work in progress and finished goods, the determination
of which costs to include becomes more complicated. Although labour and variable
overhead costs, such as utilities consumed by operating factory machines, are fairly easy
to associate directly with the production of a product, the treatment of other fixed overhead
costs is not as clear. It can be argued that costs such as factory rent should not be
included in the inventory cost because this cost will not vary with the level of production.
However, it can also be argued that without the payment of rent, the production process
could not occur. For management accounting purposes, a variety of methods are used to
account for overhead costs. For financial accounting purposes, however, it is clear that all
conversion costs need to be included in inventory. Thus, the financial accountant will need
to determine the best way to allocate fixed overhead costs. In normal circumstances,
the fixed overhead costs are simply allocated to each unit of inventory produced in an
accounting period. However, if production levels are significantly higher or lower than
normal levels, then the accountant needs to apply some judgment to the situation. If
fixed overhead costs are applied to very low levels of production, the result would be
inventory that is carried at a value that may be higher than its realizable value. For this
reason, fixed overhead costs should be allocated to low production volumes using the
rate calculated on normal production levels, with unallocated overhead being expensed

264

Inventory

in the period. This is done to avoid reporting misleadingly high inventory levels. On the
other hand, if abnormally high production occurs, the fixed overhead costs are allocated
using the actual production level. This would result in lower per-unit costs for the inventory
produced. This situation could result in higher profits, as presumably some of the excess
production would be held in inventory at the end of the year. A manager may be tempted
to increase production strictly for the purpose of increasing current earnings. Although
this does not violate any accounting standard, the accountant should be careful in this
situation, as there may be a risk of obsolete inventory as a result of the overproduction,
or there may be other forms of income-maximizing earnings management occurring.
Other Costs
IAS 2–15 indicates that other costs can be included in inventory only to the extent “they are
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.” The standard
provides examples such as certain non-production overhead costs or product-design
costs for specific customers. Clearly, the accountant would need to exercise judgment
in allocating these kinds of costs to inventory. The standard also clearly defines some
costs that should not be included in inventories but rather expensed in the current period.
These costs include the following:

• Abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour, or other production costs
• Storage costs, unless those costs are necessary in the production process before a
further production stage
• Administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing inventories to their present
location and condition
• Selling costs

As well, IAS 23–Borrowing Costs describes some limited and specific circumstances
when interest costs can be included in inventory. IAS 2-19 also discusses inventory of
a service provider. An example of this would be a professional services firm, such as an
accounting practice. These types of firms will often track work in progress on their balance
sheets. These accounts should include only direct costs (which would primarily consist of
direct and supervisory labour) and attributable overheads. These costs should not include
the costs of any administrative or sales personnel or other non-attributable overheads, nor
should they include any mark-ups on costs that might be included in standard charge rates
for customers.

7.3. Subsequent Recognition and Measurement

7.3 Subsequent Recognition and Measurement
Once the initial inventory amounts have been determined and recorded, a number of
subsequent accounting decisions need to be made. These decisions can be summarized
in the following questions:
• What type of inventory accounting system should be used?
• What cost flow assumption should be applied?
• What method can be applied to ensure reported inventories are not overvalued?
We will examine each of these issues in the following sections.

7.3.1 Inventory Accounting Systems
A merchandising business can typically be engaged in thousands or millions of inventory
transactions each year. As well, inventory can comprise a significant proportion of a
merchandising company’s total assets. It is thus important for merchandising businesses
to have robust and accurate systems in place for gathering data on inventory transactions.
The use of various technologies, such as computers, bar codes, and RFIDs, has simplified
the complex task of gathering inventory transaction information. The use of such technologies has allowed most businesses to implement perpetual inventory systems as
their data-collection method. A perpetual inventory system is one that tracks all inventory
additions and subtractions (purchases and sales) directly in the accounting records. Thus,
at any point in time, the company can produce an accurate income statement and balance
sheet that will display the amount of the cost of goods sold for the period and inventory
balance at the end of the period. This type of system provides more timely information to
managers, which can lead to better decision processes.
A periodic inventory system, on the other hand, does not track purchases and sales of
inventory items directly in the accounting records. Rather, purchases are tracked through
a separate purchases account, and the cost of goods sold is not recorded at all at the time
of sale. The cost of goods sold can be determined only at the end of the accounting period, when a physical inventory count is taken, and the ending inventory is then reconciled
with the opening inventory. This type of system is less useful for management purposes,
as profitability can be determined only at the end of the accounting period. As well, the
balance sheet would not reflect the appropriate inventory balance until the period-end
reconciliation is performed. Periodic inventory systems may be appropriate for a small
business where accounting resources are limited, but improvements in technology have
resulted in many businesses switching to perpetual inventory systems.

266

Inventory

Note that although a perpetual inventory system does result in an instantaneous update
of inventory accounts, physical inventory counts are still required under this system.
There are many situations, such as product spoilage or theft, that are not captured by
perpetual inventory systems, so it is important that companies employing these systems
still physically verify the goods at least once per year.

7.3.2 Cost Flow Assumptions
The issue of cost flow assumptions can become particularly important when prices of
inventory inputs are changing. Consider a merchandising company that purchases inventory items on a continuous basis in order to fill customer orders. At any given point during
the accounting period, the goods available for sale may consist of identical items that
were purchased at different times for different costs. The question the accountant must
answer is, which costs should be allocated to the current cost of goods sold and which
costs should continue to be held in inventory? To answer this question, the accountant
can choose from three possible methods:

• Specific identification
• Weighted average cost
• First in, first out

Specific Identification
This technique is theoretically the most correct way to allocate costs. Each unit that is
sold is specifically identified, and the cost for that unit is allocated to cost of goods sold.
This method would thus achieve the perfect matching of costs to the revenue generated.
There are, however, some disadvantages to this method. First, unless items are easy
to physically segregate, it may difficult to identify which items were actually sold. As
well, although physical segregation may be possible, this method could be expensive to
implement, as a great deal of record keeping is required. The second disadvantage of this
method is its susceptibility to earnings-management techniques. If a manager wanted to
manipulate the current period net income, he or she could do this very easily using this
method by simply choosing which items to sell and which to retain in inventory. Lower
cost items could be shipped to customers, which would result in lower cost of goods
sold, higher profits, and higher inventory values on the statement of financial position.
Because of this potential problem, this technique should be applied only in situations
where inventory items are not normally interchangeable with each other. An example of
this would be the inventory held by a car dealership. Each item would have a separate
serial number and could not be substituted for another item.

7.3. Subsequent Recognition and Measurement

267

Average Cost
This technique can be applied to either periodic or perpetual inventory systems by calculating the average of all goods available for sale and then allocating the average to both
the quantity of goods sold and the quantity of goods retained in inventory. When this
technique is applied to a perpetual inventory system, it is usually referred to as a moving
average cost. An example of a moving average cost calculation is as follows:

The moving average after each transaction is calculated as the total inventory balance divided by the
total number of units remaining. The calculation of cost of goods sold and ending balances are out slightly
due to rounding differences.

268

Inventory

The total cost of goods sold for the period is ($467.50 + $1,193.30) = $1,660.80, and
the ending inventory balance is $1,034.20. Under this approach, the average inventory
cost is recalculated after each purchase, and this revised average cost is then used to
determine the cost of goods sold when a sale is made. After a sale is made, the revised
average cost becomes the new base amount for further inventory transactions until the
next purchase occurs, and a new average is determined.
This method is often used due to its simplicity and reliability. It is very difficult for managers
to manipulate income with this method, as the effects of rising or falling prices will be
averaged over both the goods sold and the goods remaining on the balance sheet.
As well, for goods that are similar and interchangeable, this method may most closely
represent the actual physical flow of those goods.
First in, First out (FIFO)
Another cost-flow choice companies can use is referred to as the first in, first out method,
usually abbreviated as FIFO. This method allocates the oldest costs to goods sold first,
with newer costs remaining in the inventory balance. Assume the same set of facts for
PartsPeople Inc. used in the previous example. Under FIFO, each time a sale occurs,
the oldest items are removed from inventory first. The calculation of costs and inventory
amounts would be done as follows:

In this case, the total ending inventory balance of $1,068.75 is higher than the balance
calculated under the moving average cost system. This makes sense, as FIFO inventory
balances represent the most recent purchases, and in this scenario, input costs were
rising throughout the month. This feature of FIFO is considered one of its strengths,
as the method results in balance-sheet amounts that more closely represent the current
replacement cost of the inventory. Also note that the total cost of goods sold of $1,626.25
($450.00 + $1,176.25) is lower than moving average amount. This also makes sense, as
older costs, which are lower in this case, are being expensed first. This characteristic of
FIFO is also one of its major drawbacks. The method of expensing older costs first means
that proper matching is not being achieved, as current revenues are being matched to
older costs. This method thus represents a trade-off common in accounting standards. A
more relevant balance sheet results in a less relevant income statement. Moving average,
on the other hand, averages out the differences between the balance sheet and income
statement, resulting in some loss of relevance for both statements. As both methods are
acceptable under IFRS and ASPE, management would have to decide which statement
is more important to the end users and then choose a policy accordingly.

270

Inventory

How to Choose?
When making an inventory cost flow assumption, what factors do managers need to
consider? Generally, the cost flow assumption should attempt to reflect the actual physical
flow of goods as much as possible. For example, a grocery retailer selling perishable
merchandise may want to use FIFO, as it is common practice to place the oldest items at
the front of the rack to encourage their sale first. Alternatively, consider a hardware store
that sells bulk nails that are scooped from a bin. There is no way to identify the individual
items specifically, and it is likely that over time, customers scooping out nails would mix
together items stocked at different times. Weighted average costing would make the most
sense in this case, as this would likely represent the real movement of the product. For
a company selling heavy equipment, specific identification would likely make the most
sense, as each item would be unique with its own serial number, and these items can be
easily tracked.
A further consideration would be the effects on the income statement and balance sheet.
FIFO results in the inventory reported on the balance being reported at more current
costs. As there is an increasing emphasis in standard setting on valuation concepts,
this approach would result in the most useful information for determining the value of the
company. If profitability is more important to a financial-statement reader, then weighted
average cost would be more useful, as more current costs would be averaged into income.
Income taxes may also be a consideration when choosing a cost flow formula. This
motivation must be considered carefully, however, as income will be affected in opposite
ways, depending on whether input prices are rising or falling. As well, although taxes
could be reduced in any given year through the cost flow assumption made, this is only a
temporary effect, as all inventory will eventually be expensed through cost of goods sold.
Whatever method is chosen, it should be applied on a consistent basis. It would be
inappropriate for a company to change cost flow assumptions year to year, simply to
achieve a certain result in net income. Once the cost flow assumption is determined, it
should be applied the same way each year, unless there has been a significant change
in circumstances that warrants a change. A company may use different cost flow assumptions for different major inventory classes, but these choices should still be applied
consistently.
As a historical note, a further cost flow assumption, last in, first out (LIFO), was once
available for use. This method took the most recent purchases and allocated them to the
cost of the goods sold first. LIFO is now not allowed in Canada under IFRS or ASPE,
but it is still used in the United States. Although this method resulted in the most precise
matching on the income statement, tax authorities criticized it as way to reduce taxes
during periods of inflation. As well, it was more easily manipulated by management and
did not result in accurate valuations on the balance sheet. Canadian companies that are
allowed to report under US GAAP may still use this method, but it is not allowed for tax
purposes in Canada.

271

7.3.3 The Problem of Overvaluation
Overvaluation can occur when inventory is reported at a higher value than the ultimate
amount that can be recovered. This happens with changes in market conditions or
consumer tastes, or it happens for other reasons. If a particular product loses favour
with the market and must be severely discounted or even disposed of, it would not be
appropriate to continue to carry that item on the balance sheet at its cost when that cost
is not recoverable. To avoid this problem, the lower of cost and net realizable value
(LCNRV) needs to be applied. Under this approach, inventory values are reduced to their
recoverable amounts in order to ensure that current assets are not stated at an amount
greater than the ultimate amount of cash that will be realized from their sale. This also
results in recording an expense equal to the loss in value of the asset, which achieves the
effect of matching the cost to the period in which the loss actually occurs. For example,
if an inventory item has a reported cost of $1,000 but a net realizable value of only $800,
the company should record the following journal entry:
Date

Most companies will simply report the loss as part of the cost of goods sold account on
the income statement. Separate disclosure may be appropriate, however, if the amount
is considered material or unusual in nature.
What Is Net Realizable Value?
When determining the loss in inventory value, it is important to have a clear understanding
of the concept of net realizable value (NRV). Net realizable value is an estimate based
on the expected selling price of the goods in the ordinary course of business, less any
estimated costs required to complete and sell the goods. It thus represents the net cash
flow that will ultimately be generated by the sale of the product. Because the net realizable
value is an estimate, it can be affected by management estimation bias and by changes
in economic circumstances. As a result, write-downs of inventories need to be reviewed
carefully and frequently by accountants to ensure the reported amounts are reasonable.
How Is the Lower of Cost and Net Realizable Test Applied?
In general, the lower of cost and net realizable test should be applied to the most detailed
level possible. This would normally be considered to be individual inventory items. However, in some situations, it may be appropriate to group inventory items together and apply
the test at the group level. This would be appropriate only when items relate to the same
product line, have similar end uses, are produced and marketed in the same geographic
area, and cannot be segregated from other items in the product line in a reasonable or

272

Inventory

cost-effective way. If grouping is appropriate, the amount of inventory write-downs will be
less than if the test is applied on an individual-item basis. This occurs because grouping
allows for some offsetting of over- and undervalued items.
Biological Assets
One interesting exception to the lower of cost and net realizable value rule is accounting
for biological assets. Although ASPE does not specifically address these types of assets,
IFRS does present a separate standard: IAS 41 Agriculture. This standard covers raising
and harvesting living plants and animals. The biological assets are considered the original
source of the commercial activity, such as the fruit tree that produces apples, the sheep
that produces wool, or the dairy cow that produces milk. The detailed accounting for
these specialized assets goes beyond the scope of this course. Generally, the product
of the biological asset would fall under the normal rules for inventory accounting, but the
biological asset itself is accounted for at its fair value, less selling costs. This means that
every year, the value of the biological-asset must be determined, and an adjustment to the
assets carrying value must be made. This adjustment would result in an unrealized gain
or loss. As the inventory is produced, it is transferred from the biological-asset account to
an inventory account at its fair value less selling costs at the point of harvest. This value
now becomes the inventory’s cost. When inventory is sold, the sale amount is transferred
from the unrealized account to realized revenue.
Conceptually, these types of assets are similar in nature to a capital asset, but they are
also different in that they grow and obtain value independent of the inventory they produce.
This unique nature is the reason IFRS presents a separate standard for the accounting
and disclosure of biological assets.

7.4 Presentation and Disclosure
Inventories are required to be disclosed as a separate item on the company’s balance
sheet. As well, significant categories of inventories should be disclosed, such as raw
materials, work in process, and finished goods. As with any significant balance sheet
item, the company’s accounting policies for measuring and reporting inventories, including
its chosen cost formula, should be disclosed. The company should also disclose the
amount of inventories recognized as an expense during the period. This would normally
be disclosed as cost of goods sold, but there may be other material amounts that could be
disclosed separately, such as write-downs due to obsolescence and subsequent reversals
of those write-downs. As well, under IFRS, additional details of the write-downs need to
be disclosed, such as qualitative reasons for the write-downs or subsequent reversal. If
the inventory has been pledged as collateral for any outstanding debt, this fact needs to
be disclosed, along with the amount pledged.

7.5. Inventory Errors

273

7.5 Inventory Errors
Given the volume of inventory transactions that occur in a merchandising or manufacturing
business and the portable nature of many inventory items, it is inevitable that errors in
accounting for those items will occur. It is important to understand how inventory errors
affect the reported net income and financial position of the company, as these errors could
be material and could affect users’ interpretations of financial results. To understand the
effects of inventory errors, it is useful to review the formula for determining the cost of
goods sold:
Opening inventory
+ Purchases
= Goods available for sale
– Ending inventory
= Cost of goods sold

As the ending inventory for one accounting period becomes the opening inventory for the
next period, it is easy to see how an inventory error can affect two accounting periods.
Let’s look at a few examples to determine the effects of different types of inventory errors.
Example 1: Using our previous company, assume PartsPeople missed counting a box
of rotors during the year-end inventory count on December 31, 2014, because the box
was hidden in a storage room. Further assume that the cost of these rotors was $7,000
and that the invoice for the purchase was correctly recorded. How would this error
have affected the financial statements? If we consider the cost of goods sold formula
above, we can see that understating ending inventory would have overstated the cost
of goods sold, as the ending inventory is subtracted in the formula. As well, consider
the following year. The opening inventory on January 1, 2015, would have also been
understated, which would have resulted in an understatement of cost of goods sold
for 2015. Thus, over a two-year period, net income would have been understated by
$7,000 in 2014 and overstated by $7,000 in 2015. At the end of two years, the error
would have corrected itself, and the total income reported for those two years would be
correct. However, the allocation of income between the two years was incorrect, and the
company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2014, would have been incorrect. This could
be significant if, for example, PartsPeople had a bank loan with a covenant condition that
required maintenance of certain ratios, such as debt to equity or current ratios. If the error
were discovered prior to the closing of the 2014 books, it would have been corrected as
follows:

After 2015, as noted above, the error would have corrected itself, so no adjustment would
be required. However, the 2014 financial statements used for comparative purposes in
future years would have to be restated to reflect the correct amounts of inventory and cost
of goods sold.
Example 2: Suppose instead that PartsPeople correctly counted its inventory on December 31, 2014, but missed recording an invoice to purchase a $4,000 shipment of brake
pads, because the invoice fell behind a desk in the accounting office. Again, using our cost
of goods sold formula, we can see that an understatement of purchases will result in an
understatement of the cost of goods sold. As the ending inventory balance was counted
correctly, one may think that this problem was isolated to this year only. However, in 2015,
the vendor may have issued a replacement invoice when they realized PartsPeople hadn’t
paid for the shipment. When PartsPeople recorded the invoice in 2015, the purchases for
that year would have been overstated, which means the cost of goods sold was also
overstated. Again, the error corrected itself over two years, but the allocation of income
between the two years was incorrect. If the error was discovered before the books were
closed for 2014 (and before a replacement invoice is issued by the vendor), it would have
been corrected as follows:
Date

Example 3: This time, let’s consider the effect of two errors. Assume PartsPeople sold
goods to a customer with terms FOB shipping on December 29, 2014. The company
correctly recorded this as a sale on December 29, but due to a data-processing error,
the goods, with a cost of $900, were not removed from inventory. Further, assume that

7.6. Estimating Inventory

275

a supplier sent a shipment to PartsPeople on December 29, also with the terms FOB
shipping, and the cost of these goods was $500. These goods were not received until
January 4 of the following year, but due to poor cut-off procedures at PartsPeople, these
goods were not included in the year-end inventory balance.
In this situation, we have two different errors that create opposing effects on the income
statement and balance sheet. The goods sold to the customer should not have been
included in inventory, resulting in an overstatement of year-end inventory. The goods
shipped by the supplier should have been included in inventory, resulting in an understatement of year-end inventory. The net effect of the two errors is a $900 − $500 = $400
overstatement of ending inventory. This will result in an understatement of the cost of
goods sold and thus an overstatement of net income. If these errors were discovered
before the books were closed in 2014, the entry to correct them would be as follows:

These three illustrations are just a small sample of the many kinds of inventory errors
that can occur. In evaluating the effect of inventory errors, it is important to have a clear
understanding of the nature of the error and its impact on the cost of goods sold formula.
It is also important to consider the effect of the error on subsequent years. Although
immediate correction of errors is preferable, most inventory errors will correct themselves
over a two-year period. However, even if an error corrects itself, there may still be a need
to restate comparative financial-statement information.

7.6 Estimating Inventory
Although a business will normally take an inventory count at least once per year to
verify the perpetual inventory records, there may be circumstances where an inventory
count is either impractical or impossible. For example, when a company prepares interim
unaudited financial statements, it may be too costly to conduct an inventory count, as

276

Inventory

operations would have to cease during the count, and staff would need to be reallocated to
this purpose. Or, in the case where a disaster strikes, such as a warehouse fire, inventory
may be destroyed, making a count impossible. In these situations, the company may
choose to use an estimation method to determine the inventory. The estimated balance
can be used for the interim financial statements or for making an insurance claim in the
case of a disaster. Several methods can be used to estimate inventory. We will focus on
the gross profit method.
This method attempts to estimate the inventory balance at a point in time using past relationships between the cost of goods sold and sales and then applying the cost of goods
sold formula to determine the ending inventory balance. Consider the following scenario
for PartsPeople. On May 17, 2014, a fire caused by faulty electrical wiring completely
destroyed one of the company’s warehouses and all of the contents. Fortunately, this
loss was covered by the company’s insurance policy, but in order to make a claim, the
company needed a credible estimate of the amount of inventory destroyed. Assume that
the inventory on January 1, 2014, was reported at a cost of $250,000, which was verified
by a count. As well, assume that between January 1 and May 17, 2014, the cost of all
inventory purchases was $820,000, and sales for this period were reported at $1,200,000.
Based on analysis of the previous year’s results, the company knows that its gross profit
percentage is 25 percent. Based on this information, the company could have estimated
the cost of the destroyed inventory as follows:
Inventory on January 1
Purchases
Goods available for sale
Sales
Less gross profit (25% × $1,200,000)
Estimated cost of goods sold
Estimated inventory on May 17

$250,000
$820,000
$1,070,000
$1,200,000
$300,000
$900,000
$170,000

PartsPeople could have used this information to make a claim in the amount of $170,000
for inventory damaged in the fire. There are some obvious limitations in using this technique. First, the gross profit percentage used here was based on the previous year’s
results. If the company had made changes to its pricing or purchasing strategies in
2014, the percentage would need to have been adjusted. Second, a single gross profit
percentage has been used for all inventory items. It is quite likely that individual inventory
items would have different amounts of gross profit built into their pricing, depending on
consumer demand, purchasing dynamics, and so on. This blanket rate is based on
an average of all inventory items, but depending on the product mix of both sales and
purchases during the intervening period, this rate may not be appropriate.
Because this technique provides only an estimate, it should not be used for annual
financial reporting purposes. In the circumstances noted above, however, it can be useful,
but the calculated amount should be compared with the perpetual inventory records

7.7. Inventory Analysis

277

to determine the reasonableness of the estimate. Management should consider the
suitability of the single gross profit percentage and consider any adjustments that may
be appropriate.

7.7 Inventory Analysis
As mentioned previously, inventory can be a significant asset for many businesses, as
it represents profit-generating potential. Buying or producing goods at a certain price
and then selling them for a higher price is the essence of the retail, wholesale and
manufacturing sectors. Obviously, efficient management of these inventories is essential
for the success of the business. A company needs to control the cost of inventories in
order to maintain its profit margins. As well, companies need to ensure that inventories
move through the system quickly. Inventories sitting in a warehouse, unsold, are not
producing profits or cash flow for the company. While the items sit in the warehouse, the
company will incur costs: the cost of the warehouse space itself and the cost of funds
required to finance the inventory. Obviously, to minimize these costs, it is important to sell
the inventory as quickly as possible, while maintaining the desired margin.
To analyze inventory, we will look at two types of ratios: gross profit margin and inventory
turnover period.
Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit represents the difference between sales revenue and cost of sales. This is
an essential measurement in determining the profitability of a business, as it represents
the profit generated by the primary business activity of selling goods, before considering
any other expenses. To facilitate comparisons between different sales volumes, the gross
profit margin is calculated as follows:

Gross profit margin =

Gross profit
× 100
Sales revenue

By expressing this relationship as a percentage, one can make comparisons between
different companies or different accounting periods for the same company. This is a type
of common size analysis that helps the reader discern relationships and trends that may
indicate something about the company’s profitability. Consider the following example from
the financial statements of a large automobile manufacturer (in $ millions):

278

$ 140,100

123,400

125,300

$ 12,800

$ 14,800

Cost of sales
Gross profit

Sales declined slightly in 2016 compared with the previous year, as did gross profit. By
calculating the gross profit margin, we can get a better idea of the meaning of these
results:

Gross profit margin 2016 = 9.40%
Gross profit margin 2015 = 10.56%

Although the gross profit margin dropped by only 1.16 percent between years, this represents lost profits of approximately $1.5 billion on this scale of revenues. Management
would obviously be motivated to find ways to control these margins to prevent further
declines, whether through adjusting sales prices or controlling costs better.
Inventory Turnover Period
Aside from the profitability of the business’s core activities as calculated above, management is also interested in the efficiency of carrying out those activities. One way
to measure the efficiency of inventory movements to calculate the inventory turnover
period:

Inventory turnover period =

Average inventories held
× 365
Cost of sales

This ratio will help us understand how quickly the company moves inventory through the
various business processes that eventually result in a sale. For a manufacturing company,
this process begins with the receipt of raw materials and ends when the finished goods
are finally sold. Once again, consider the reported inventory levels of the automobile
manufacturer (in $ millions): 2016–$7,860, 2015–$7,700, 2014–$7,360.
Using the formula above, we can determine the following inventory turnover periods:

2016: 23.01 days
2015: 21.94 days

7.8. IFRS/ASPE Key Differences

279

(Note that the average inventories amount was calculated as the simple average of opening and closing inventories. For businesses with seasonal or other unusual patterns of
sales, more sophisticated calculations of the average inventories may be required.)
In this example, the inventory turnover period increased by slightly more than one day
during the current year. This may not seem significant, but it does indicate that inventories
are being held for a longer time, which will increase the company’s costs. Line managers
are very motivated to find ways to reduce the turnover period through more efficient
purchasing practices, better production techniques, and more effective sales promotions.
It should be noted that the absolute values of the ratios we have calculated are not
particularly useful on their own. Like all ratios, a comparison or benchmark is needed for
comparison. Most companies will start by comparing the ratio with the previous year to
see if improvements have occurred in the current year. Many managers will also compare
with a budgeted or target amount, as this will provide feedback on the actions they have
taken. It may also be useful to compare with industry standards or competitor data, as
this indicates something of the company’s competitive position. Ratio analysis does not
provide answers to questions, but it does help managers and other financial statement
users to identify areas where performance is improving or declining.

Inventory

Chapter Summary
LO 1 Define inventory, and identify those characteristics that
distinguish it from other assets.
Inventories can be a significant asset for many businesses. The key feature of inventory
is that it is held for sale in the normal course of business, which distinguishes it from
financial instruments and long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment.

LO 2: Identify the types of costs that should be included in inventory.
Recognition of the initial cost of purchase should include transportation, discounts, and
other nonrecoverable taxes and fees that need to be paid to transport the goods to the
place of business. FOB terms of purchase need to be considered when applying cut-off
procedures at the end of the accounting period. This is important for determining when
the responsibility for the inventory passes from the seller to the buyer. For manufacturers,
conversion costs must also be included in inventory. For direct materials and labour, this
allocation is fairly straightforward. However certain issues with overhead allocations can
occur with low or high production levels. With abnormally low production levels, overheads
should be allocated at the rate used for normal production levels. With abnormally high
production levels, overheads should be allocated using the actual level of production.
Other costs required to bring the inventory to the place of business and get into a saleable
condition may also be included. The accountant will need to exercise judgment when
considering other costs to include.

LO 3: Identify accounting issues and treatments applied to inventory
subsequent to its purchase.
LO 3.1: Describe the differences between periodic and perpetual inventory systems.
Perpetual inventory systems are those that instantly update accounting records for sales
and purchases of goods. These types of systems are commonly used today and are
facilitated by advances in computer and other technologies. Periodic inventory systems
do not allow for the real-time updating of accounting records. Rather, these systems
require a periodic inventory count (at least annually) that is then used to derive the cost
of goods sold. These types of systems are less useful for management purposes. Even
under a perpetual inventory system, annual inventory counts are still required to detect

Chapter Summary

spoilage, theft, or other unaccounted inventory changes.
LO 3.2: Identify the appropriate criteria for selection of a cost flow formula, and
apply different cost flow formulas to inventory transactions.
The cost flow formula determines how to allocate inventory costs between the income
statement and the balance sheet. Although specific identification of individual inventory
items is the most precise way to allocate these costs, this method would only be appropriate with inventory items whose characteristics uniquely differentiate them from other
inventory units. For homogeneous inventory products, weighted average or first in, first
out (FIFO) are appropriate choices. Weighted average (or moving average, when used
with a perpetual inventory system) recalculates the average cost of the inventory every
time a new purchase is made. This revised cost is used to determine the cost of goods
sold. With FIFO, the oldest inventory items are assumed to be sold first. Each method
has certain advantages and disadvantages, and each has a different effect on the balance
sheet and income statement. The choice of method will depend on the actual physical
movement of goods, financial reporting objectives, tax considerations, and other factors.
Whatever method is chosen, it should be applied consistently.
LO 3.3: Determine when inventories are overvalued, and apply the lower of cost
and net realizable value rule to write-down those inventories.
When economic circumstances change, such as a shift in consumer preferences, a company may find itself holding inventory that cannot be sold for its carrying value. In this
case, the inventory should be written-down to its net realizable value (selling price less
estimated costs required to complete and sell the goods) in order to ensure the balance
sheet is not reporting a current asset at a value greater than the amount of cash that can
be realized from its sale. Generally, this technique should be applied on an individual-item
basis, but in certain cases where a group of products all belong to one product line, are
produced and marketed in one geographic area, have similar end uses, or are difficult
to segregate, it may be appropriate to apply the test on a grouped basis. Judgment is
required in applying this technique, as net realizable values are estimates that may not be
easy to verify.
One unique application of fair value inventory accounting relates to biological assets.
These are assets that are living plants or animals used to produce an agricultural product.
Under IFRS these assets are adjusted to their fair value, less selling costs, each year. This
can result in increases as well as decreases in value.

282

Inventory

LO 4: Describe the presentation and disclosure requirements for
inventories under both IFRS and ASPE.
Inventory should be described separately on the balance sheet, with separate disclosure
of major categories such as raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. Accounting policies used should also be disclosed, as well as the amount of any inventory that
has been pledged as collateral for any liability. The amount of inventory expensed during
the period should be disclosed as cost of goods sold on the income statement, but other
categories, if material, could be disclosed separately, such as significant write-downs or
reversals of write-downs.

LO 5: Identify the effects of inventory errors on both the balance
sheet and income statement, and prepare appropriate adjustments
to correct the errors.
Due to the nature and relative volume of inventory transactions, material errors in financial
reporting can occur. To correct these errors, the accountant must have a firm understanding of the cost of goods sold formula and its effects on both the current and subsequent
years. If inventory errors are discovered after the closing of the books, an adjustment to
retained earnings may be required. If an error is not discovered until two years after its
occurrence, it is quite likely that the error has corrected itself. In this case, no adjusting
entry would be required, but restatement of prior-year comparative results would still be
necessary.

LO 6: Calculate estimated inventory amounts using the gross profit
method.
The gross profit method can be useful for estimating inventory amounts when a physical
count is impractical or impossible. This could be the case when for interim reporting
periods or when the inventory is destroyed in a disaster. The technique uses past gross
profit percentages and applies it to purchases and sales during the period to estimate the
amount of inventory on hand. The method is not appropriate for annual financial reporting
purposes, as the estimate could be subject to error as a result of using past gross profit
percentages that are not representative of current margins or are not representative of
the current product mix. Considerable judgment and care should be applied when using
this method.

Chapter Summary

283

LO 7: Calculate gross profit margin and inventory turnover period,
and evaluate the significance of these results with respect to the
profitability and efficiency of the business’s operations.
Managers are concerned about the profitability of the company’s core business of buying
and selling products. Managers are also concerned with the efficiency with which products are moved through the production and sales process. Calculating gross profit margin
can identify trends in the profitability of the company’s core operations. Calculating inventory turnover period can identify problems with the efficiency movement of inventories,
including raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. Ratio calculations need to
be compared with some type of benchmark to be meaningful.

LO 8: Identify differences in accounting for inventories between
ASPE and IFRS.
Inventory accounting standards under IFRS and ASPE are substantially the same. The
primary difference relates to biological assets. IFRS has a complete set of standards (IAS
41) for these types of assets, whereas ASPE does not separately identify this category.
As well, IFRS requires certain additional disclosures that ASPE does not, including a
description of qualitative reasons for inventory write-ups and write-downs.

Intercorporate Investments

An Acquisition Debacle for Hewlett Packard
In 2011, Hewlett-Packard (HP) purchased approximately 87% of the share capital (213
million shares) of Autonomy Corporation plc. for US $11.1 billion cash. The purpose of
this acquisition was to ensure that HP took the lead in the quickly growing enterprise
information management sector. Autonomy’s products and solutions complemented
HP’s existing enterprise offerings and strengthened the company’s data analytics,
cloud, industry, and workflow management capabilities, so the acquisition made sense
from a strategic point of view.
Autonomy HP was to operate as a separate business unit. Dr. Mike Lynch, founder
and CEO of Autonomy, would continue to lead Autonomy HP’s business and report to
HP’s Chief Executive Meg Whitman (Hewlett Packard, 2011).
However, trouble quickly brewed and in 2012, accounting “anomalies” were uncovered
by HP, giving rise to a massive impairment write-down of the Autonomy HP unit to the
tune of an $8.8 billion impairment charge. Compared to the original $11.1 billion
purchase price, the impairment represented a whopping 79% drop in the investment’s
value, a mere one year later.
HP alleged that the owners of Autonomy misrepresented their company’s financial
position due to what HP referred to as serious accounting improprieties. To make
matters worse, all this came at a bad time for HP, given that its fourth quarter financial
results were already down 20% in hardware sales and 12% in laptop/desktop sales
(Souppouris, 2012).
The question remained; how was it possible to lose 79% of Autonomy HP unit value in
less than one year? HP claims to have discovered all kinds of accounting irregularities
which were denied by Autonomy’s founder and CEO, Mike Lynch. HP claimed that it
would have paid half the purchase price, had it known what it later discovered about
Autonomy’s true profitability and growth.
Consider that software companies like Autonomy do not have much value in hard
assets, so the impairment did not relate to a revaluation of assets. Also, Autonomy
did not have much in the way of outstanding invoices, so there was no large nonpayment of amounts owed to trigger the drop in value and subsequent impairment
write-down.

289

290

Intercorporate Investments

So the impairment charge more likely reflected a reassessment by HP of the future
cash flows originally estimated, based on the financials, to be much less than
anticipated. This is backed up by Chief Executive Meg Whitman’s assertion that
Autonomy’s real operating profit margin was closer to 30%, and not its reported 40
to 45%.
Whitman accused Autonomy of recording both long-term deals and sales through
resellers as fully realized sales. Consider that the booking of revenue is not clearcut in the software industry because of the differing accounting rules. For example,
if Autonomy recorded an extra $20 million of future sales now, without recording
the associated additional cost of goods sold, the gross profit percentage would
exponentially increase, perhaps by as much as 10 to 15%.
HP also stated that the actual losses of Autonomy’s loss-prone hardware division were
misclassified as “sales and marketing expenses” in the operating expenses section
rather than as cost of goods sold in the gross profit section. Since sales figures were
reported as steeply increasing, this would create a more favourable overall growth
rate. Since growth is another factor in business valuations, this exponential effect
could also have affected the purchase price HP thought it was willing to pay.
Companies can also increase reported net income by inappropriately classifying
certain current expenses as investments (assets), which are thereafter amortized
over several years. Some analysts suspected that Autonomy misclassified some of its
research costs in this way. Moreover, some of Autonomy’s growth was generated
from acquisitions of other businesses. Takeovers can, for example, give a more
favourable impression of growth rates, if pre-acquisition sales are understated. In
this light, apparently, some analysts questioned Autonomy’s acquisition accounting.
With all the factors discussed above, it is possible that HP could allege and
demonstrate that inappropriate reporting and valuation errors led to a discrepancy
the size of which it purports. Autonomy HP unit CEO, Mike Lynch, denies all
charges of reporting impropriety or error. He said that Autonomy followed international
accounting rules.
Until HP’s accusations are fully investigated, it will be impossible for stakeholders and
others to know what really happened.

Introduction
Intercorporate investments arise when companies invest in other companies’ securities
as the Hewlett Packard shares acquisition cover story illustrates. This chapter will focus
on explaining how these investments are classified, measured (both initially and subsequently), reported, and analyzed. Canada currently has two IFRS standards in effect:
IFRS 9, which was effective January 1, 2018 and ASPE. The purpose of this chapter is to
identify the various classifications and accounting treatments permitted by either standard
for investments in other companies’ debt and equity securities.

8.1 Intercorporate Investments: Overview
There are many reasons why companies invest in bonds, shares, and securities of other
companies. It is well-known that banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions hold large portfolios of investments (financed by deposits and fees their customers
paid to the banks) to increase their interest income. But it may also be the best way
for companies in non-financial industry sectors to utilize excess cash and to strengthen
relationships with other companies. If the investments can earn a higher return compared
to idle cash sitting in a bank account, then it may be in a company’s best interests to
invest. The returns from these investments will be in the form of interest income, dividend
income, or an appreciation in the value of the investment itself, such as the market price
of a share.
In some cases, investments are a part of a portfolio of actively managed short-term investments undertaken in the normal course of business, to offset other financial risks such

8.1. Intercorporate Investments: Overview

293

as foreign exchange fluctuations. Other portfolios may be for longer-term investments
such as bonds that will increase the company’s interest income. These are examples of
non-strategic investments where the prime reason for investing is to increase company
income using cash not required for normal business operations.
Alternatively, companies may undertake strategic investments where the prime reason
is to enhance a company’s operations. If the percentage of voting shares held as an
investment is large enough, the investing company can exercise its right to influence or
control the investee company’s investing, financing and operating decisions. Strategies
to purchase shares of a manufacturer, wholesaler, or customer company can strengthen
those relationships, perhaps to guarantee a source of raw materials or increase market
share for sales. In some cases, it can be part of a strategy to take over a competitor
because it would enhance business operations and profits to do so. Intercorporate investments do have risks as the opening story explains. Hewlett Packard’s acquisition of
a controlling interest in the voting shares of Autonomy Corp. is an example of where a
strategic investment, which was to improve HP’s operations and profit, does not always
work out as originally intended.
The many different reasons why companies invest in other companies creates significant accounting and disclosure challenges for standard setters. For example, how are
investments to be classified and reported in order to provide relevant information about
the investments to the stakeholders? What is the best measurement—cost or fair value?
How should investments be reported if the investment’s value were to suddenly decline
in the market place? Are there differences in the accounting treatments and reporting
requirements between IFRS and ASPE? These are all relevant accounting issues that
will be examined in this chapter.
What are Investments?
Investments are financial assets. Chapter 6: Cash and Receivables, defines financial
assets as those that have contractual rights to receive cash or other financial assets from
another party. Examples of intercorporate investments include the purchase of another
company’s debt instruments (such as bonds or convertible debt) or equity instruments
(such as common shares, preferred shares, options, rights, and warrants). The company
purchasing the investment (investor) will report these purchases as investment assets,
while the company whose bonds or shares were purchased (investee) will report these
as liabilities or equity respectively. For this reason, intercorporate investments are financial instruments because the financial asset reported by one company gives rise to a
financial liability or equity instrument in another company.
Initial Measurement
The initial measurement for investments is relatively straightforward. All investments are
initially measured at fair value which is the acquisition price that would normally be agreed
to between unrelated parties. Any transactions costs such as fees and commissions

294

Intercorporate Investments

are either expensed or included in the investment asset except valuation which will be
explained later in the chapter.
Subsequent Measurement
There is no single subsequent measurement for all investments for IFRS and ASPE.
Below is a summary of the various classification alternatives for the two current standards
for IFRS 9 and ASPE.

As stated above, investments can either be a strategic acquisition of voting shares of another company in order to influence the investee company’s operating, investing, financing
decisions, or a non-strategic financing decision in order to earn a return on otherwise idle
or under-utilized cash. Within these two broad categories are six classifications: fair
value through net income (FVNI), fair value through OCI (FVOCI), amortized cost (AC),
significant influence, subsidiary, and joint arrangement.
Both IFRS and ASPE identify some percentage of ownership reference points as guidelines to help determine in which category to classify an investment. For example, any
investment in shares where the ownership is less than 20% would be considered a
non-strategic investment. It is highly unlikely that this level of ownership would result
in having any influence on a company’s decisions or operations. These investments are
acquired mainly for the investment return of interest income, dividend income, and capital
appreciation resulting from a change in fair values of the investment itself, depending on
the company’s investment business model. For share purchases of between 20% and
50%, the investor will more likely have a significant influence over the investee company
as previously explained. These percentages are not cast in stone. Classifications of

8.1. Intercorporate Investments: Overview

295

investments do not always have to adhere to these ranges where it can be shown that
another classification is a better measure of the true economic substance of the investment. For example, an investment of 30% of the shares of a company may not have
any significant influence if the remaining 70% is held by very few other investors who are
tightly connected together. The circumstances for each investment must be considered
when determining the classification of an investment purchase.
A share investment of 50% or greater will result in the investor having control over the
company’s decisions and policies because the majority of the shares are held by the
investing company. The investee company will be regarded as a subsidiary of the investor
company. This was the case in the cover story where Hewlett Packard purchased the
majority of the outstanding shares of Autonomy Corporation in order to enhance HP’s
operations.

Classifications and Accounting Treatments
Below is a classification summary for IFRS 9 and ASPE (Sec. 3856). Note the differences
between the accounting standards. ASPE has two classifications for its non-strategic
investments and IFRS has three classifications. The table below summarizes the classification criteria for ASPE and IFRS:

Under IFRS 9, investments are divided into separate portfolios according to the way they
are managed. For non-strategic investments these classifications are based on “held to
collect solely principal and interest cash flows (AC)”, “held to collect solely principal and
interest cash flows AND to sell (FVOCI)”, and “all else (FVNI)”. That is not to say that
investments classified as AC can never be sold, but sales in this classification would be
incidental and made in response to some sort of change in the investment, such as an
increase in investment risk. FVOCI considers that sales are an integral part of portfolio
management where active buying and selling are typical activities in order to collect cash
flows while investing is held, AND to realize increases in fair values through selling. Both
ASPE and IFRS allows companies to classify an investment as FVNI only at acquisition.
For IFRS this FVNI election is only to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting
mismatch arising from a measurement or recognition inconsistency for investments that
would otherwise be classified as AC or FVOCI.
Differences in the ASPE standard, such as the choice of either straight-line or effective
interest rate methods or impairment evaluation and measurement of certain investments,
will be separately identified throughout the chapter. Companies that follow IFRS can

choose to record interest, dividends, and fair value adjustments to a single “investment
income or loss” account or they can keep these separated in their own accounts. ASPE
requires that interest, dividends, and fair value adjustments each be reported separately.
Since IFRS companies still need to know the interest expense from any dividends received for tax purposes, this chapter separates interest and dividends for both IFRS
and ASPE companies, as this is appropriate for both standards and for simplicity and
consistency.
Below are the classification categories with details about how they are measured and
reported.

Investments in debt and equity, including derivatives, are reported at their fair value at
each balance sheet date with fair value changes reported in net income. Transactions
costs are expensed as incurred. Any gain (loss) upon sale of the investment is reported in
net income. FVNI investments are reported as a current asset if they meet the conditions
of a current asset, such as; a cash equivalent, are held for trading purposes, or are
expected to mature or be sold within 12 months of the balance sheet/SFP reporting date
or the normal operating cycle. Otherwise, they are a long-term asset.
Market (fair) values can go up or down while FVNI investments are being held. These
increases and decreases are referred to as unrealized gains and losses and are reported in net income. Once a sale occurs, the investment can either be remeasured to
its fair value as an unrealized gain/loss followed by the receipt of cash, or the gain or loss
will be recorded as realized and reported through net income as a gain (loss) from the
sale of the investment. Either treatment is acceptable for FVNI classification, because the
unrealized and realized gains/losses are reported the same way in the income statement.
2

Equities in FVNI classification can include non-hedged derivatives such as options or warrants.

Intercorporate Investments

For this reason, treatment as either an unrealized or realized gain/loss upon sales can
become blurred.
In order to preserve the original cost of the investment, companies may choose to use
an asset valuation allowance account instead of directly changing the asset carrying
value. This is an option for any of the FVNI, FVOCI, and AC classification discussed in
this chapter and will be illustrated in more detail below.

Impairment
Investments are reported at fair value at each reporting date, so no separate impairment
evaluations and entries are required.

FVNI Investments in Shares
The accounting for FVNI equity investments such as shares is usually more straightforward compared to debt investments such as bonds.

Note that the transaction fees are expensed for FVNI investments. This makes intuitive
sense since the shares are being purchased at their fair market value and this represents
the maximum amount that can be reported on the investor company’s balance sheet. At
December 31 year-end, Lornelund makes two adjusting entries to record the latest fair
values changes for each FVNI investment. The fair value for Symec shares increased
from $150 to $165 per share, resulting in an overall increase in the investment value
by $15,000 (from $150,000 to $165,000). Conversely, the fair value for Hemiota shares
decreased from $84 to $82 per share, resulting in a decrease in the investment value of
$5,000 (from $210,000 to $205,000). In both cases, the gains and losses will be reported
in the income statement as unrealized gains (losses) on FVNI investments. The FVNI
investment account would appear in the balance sheet as shown below.

Intercorporate Investments

As previously mentioned, instead of recording the changes in fair value directly to the
FVNI investment account as shown above, companies will often record the changes to a
valuation allowance as a contra account to the FVNI investment account (asset). This
separates and preserves the original cost information from the fair value changes in much
the same way as the accumulated depreciation account for buildings or equipment. If a
valuation allowance contra account was used, the balance sheet would appear as follows:

On January 10, 2016, the Symec shares were sold at $165.70 per share. As previously
explained, the shares can be remeasured to fair value prior to recording the sales proceeds, or the entry can skip that step and record the sales proceeds with the gain/loss as
realized from sale of the investment. The entry above chose the latter, simpler alternative.

FVNI Investments in Debt
FVNI investments can also be bonds, if market fair values are determinable. On January
1, 2015, Osterline Ltd. purchases 7%, 5-year bonds of Waterland Inc. with a face value
of $500,000. Interest is payable on July 1 and January 1. The market rate for a bond with
similar characteristics and risks is 6%. The bond sells for $521,326.3
On December 31, the fair value of the bonds at year-end is $510,000. Osterline follows
IFRS. The interest is calculated using the effective interest method as shown below.

3

$521,326 is the present value of the bond’s future cash flows. Since the bond interest is being paid
twice per year, the number of payments is 10 payments (5 years × 2 payments per year) until the bond
matures. The market interest rate is 6% or 3% for each semi-annual interest payment. At maturity, $500,000
principal amount of the bond is payable to the bondholder/investor. The present value can be calculated
using a financial calculator as follows: PV = 17,500 P/A, 3 I/Y, 10 N, 500,000 FV). For a review of present
value techniques, refer to Chapter 6: Cash and Receivables.

The bond was initially valued and recorded at its purchase price (fair value) of $521,326.
Note that this is higher than the face value of $500,000. This is referred to as purchasing
at a premium, which is amortized to the FVNI investment account over the life of the bond
using the effective interest method. This method was also discussed in Chapter 6: Cash
and Receivables; review that material again, if necessary. There were no transaction
costs, but these would have been expensed as incurred just as was done in the previous
FVNI shares example.
The July 1, 2015, entry was for interest income based on the market rate (or yield) for 3%
(6% annually for six months), while the cash paid by Waterland on that date of $17,500
was based on the stated or face rate for 3.5% (7% annually for six months). The $1,860
difference was the amount of premium to be amortized to the FVNI investment account
on that date. On Dec 31, there were two adjusting entries:
• The first entry was for the interest income that has accrued since the last interest
payment on July 1. This interest entry must be done before the fair value adjustment
to ensure that the carrying value is up to date.
• The second adjusting entry is for the fair value adjustment which is the difference
between the investment’s carrying value of $517,550 ($521,326 − 1,860 − 1,916)
and the fair value on that date of $510,000. Since the fair value is less than the
carrying value, this FVNI investment (or a valuation allowance) is reduced to its fair
value by $7,550 ($517,550 − 510,000). The investment carrying amount after the
adjustment is now equal to the fair value of $510,000.
It is important to note that the July 1, 2016, interest income of $15,527 calculated after the
fair value adjustment had been recorded continues to be based on the amounts calculated
in the original effective interest schedule. The interest rate calculations will continue
to use the original effective interest rate schedule amounts throughout the bond’s
life, without any consideration for the changes in fair value.
On July 1, 2016, just after receiving the interest, Osterline sells the bonds at the market
rate of 107. The entry for the sale of the bonds on July 1, 2016 is shown below.

Recall from the journal entries above that on December 31, 2015, the investment had
been reduced to its fair value of $510,000. On July 1, 2016, the interest entry included
amortization of the premium for $1,973, resulting in a carrying value as at July 1, 2016
of $508,027. The market price for selling the investment was 107 resulting in a gain of
$26,973. Note that this entry skipped the remeasure to fair value as an unrealized holding
gain and recorded the sale entry as simply a gain on sale. Either method is acceptable.
ASPE companies can choose to use straight-line amortization of the bond premium instead of the effective interest method. If straight-line was used, the amount recorded to
the investment account would be $2,133 ($21,326÷5 years×6÷12) at each interest date
until the investment is sold.

Again, note that no separate impairment evaluations or entries are recorded since the
debt investment is already adjusted to its current fair value at each reporting date.

Investments in Foreign Currencies
Investments may be priced in foreign currencies, which must be converted into Canadian
currency for recording and reporting purposes. Illustrated below are the accounting
entries for a FVNI investment priced in a foreign currency.
FVNI investments purchased in foreign currencies are converted into Canadian currency
using the exchange rates at the time of the purchase. Also, depending on the accounting
standard and the circumstances of the investment, the fair value adjusting entry may
have to separately record the foreign exchange gain (loss) from the fair value adjustment
amount.
For example, assume that the US dollar is worth $1.03 Canadian at the time of an
investment purchase for US $50,000 bonds at par. In Canadian dollars, the amount would
be $51,500. The entry to record the purchase would be:

At year-end, the fair value of the bonds is US $49,000 and the exchange rate at that time
is 1.05. In Canadian dollars the amount would be $51,450 (US $49,000 ×1.05) compared
to the original purchase price in Canadian dollars of $51,500, an overall net loss of $50.

Note that the exchange rate increased from 1.03 to 1.05 for the US $50,000 investment
amount. This increase in the exchange rate resulted in a gain of Cdn $1,000 which was

8.2.2 Fair Value Through OCI Investments (FVOCI); (IFRS only)
Types of Investments

Accounting Treatment

• Debt (bonds)

• Interest and dividends
earned/declared.

• Debt (bonds)

• Remeasure investment to fair value at each reporting date
through OCI. Can be recorded directly to investment or
through an asset valuation account.

• Equities (shares) by
special irrevocable
election only at
acquisition

through

net

income

as

• Upon sale, remeasure investment sold to its fair value with
gains/losses through OCI.
• Reclassify the OCI for the debt investment sold to net
income (FVOCI with recycling), and to retained earnings for
equities investments (FVOCI without recycling).

Looking at the table above, one cannot help but notice how the FVOCI debt investments
are recycled through net income when sold in contrast to the FVOCI equities investments
which are not recycled, and are reclassified to retained earnings instead, bypassing net
income altogether. Originally, the FVOCI classification was without recycling for both debt
and equity. This was done to lessen the instances of “earnings management” which is
the manipulation of earnings due to bias. By timing the most opportune time to sell,
a company could suddenly boost net income resulting from the reclassification of OCI
from AOCI to net income of the unrealized gains dating back to when the investment was
purchased. However, it appears that an exception has now been made to allow FVOCI
debt investments to recycle through net income. FVOCI investments in equities continue
to be classified as FVOCI without recycling.
FVOCI debt and equity investments are reported at their fair value at each balance sheet
date with fair value changes recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Unlike FVNI
investments, transaction costs are usually added to the carrying amount of the FVOCI
investment, and are usually reported as long-term assets unless it is expected they will
be sold within twelve months or the normal operating cycle.
The fair value measurement at each reporting date is recorded to the investment asset
account (or an asset valuation account). The unrealized holding gain (loss) is recorded
to unrealized gain (loss) OCI and reported in OCI (net-of-tax). When the investments
are sold, a remeasure to fair value can precede the entry for the sales proceeds, or
alternatively, any gains (losses) resulting from the sale are reported in net income as a
realized gain (loss) on sale of investment.

306

Intercorporate Investments

This is the point where FVOCI investments in debt differ from FVOCI investments
in equity.
For FVOCI, debt investment sold:

• any unrealized gain (loss) in AOCI at the time of the sale is reclassified from AOCI
to net income (with recycling).

For FVOCI, equity investment sold:

• any unrealized gain (loss) in AOCI at the time of the sale is reclassified from AOCI
to retained earnings (without recycling).

Recall from the chapter on Statement of Income and Statement of Changes in Equity,
that OCI is not included in net income, and is reported in a separate statement called the
Statement of Comprehensive Income. This means that any unrealized gains (losses) from
holding FVOCI investments will not be reported as net income until the debt investment
is sold or impaired as will now be discussed. Students are encouraged to review the
material regarding the topic of OCI.

Impairment of Investments with no recycling (Equity)
For FVOCI in equity investments, there is no need for impairment tests because equities
are continually re-measured to their fair value based on the readily available market prices
and these changes in value are not reported in net income, so impairment testing is not
done. For FVOCI investments in debt, impairments will be discussed in detail in the
FVOCI with recycling (debt) section later in this chapter.

FVOCI (without recycling) – Investments in Shares
The similarities and differences between FVNI and FVOCI investments journal entries will
be examined next, since both apply fair value remeasurements, but differ in how these
are recorded and reported. Using the same example for Lornelund Ltd. used in the FVNI
investments above, a comparison between the entries required for FVNI and FVOCI is
shown below. The transactions are repeated below but now include another fair value
change at the end of 2016.

Note that the transaction fees are expensed for FVNI investments but are added to the carrying value for FVOCI investments. At December 31 year-end, Lornelund makes two endof-period adjusting entries to record the latest fair values changes for each investment.
The fair value for Symec shares increased FVOCI $150 to $165 per share resulting in an
increase in the investment value by $15,000 and $13,750 for FVNI and FVOCI categories
respectively. These amounts are different due to the transaction costs originally recorded
to the investment asset of the FVOCI investment. The fair value for Hemiota shares
decreased from $84 to $82 per share resulting in a decrease in the investment value of
$5,000 for both FVNI and FVOCI investments.
Ignoring taxes for simplicity, below are the financial statements for 2015 under FVNI and
FVOCI:

There is no difference in the ending balances of the investment asset accounts under the
FVNI and FVOCI methods on December 31, 2015, because both are reported at fair value
at each reporting date. Even though the transaction costs were initially capitalized under
the FVOCI method, the year-end fair value adjustment entry for both FVNI and FVOCI
investments resulted in equalizing the investments balances.

As can be seen from the illustrations above, there are significant differences in net income,
due to the accounting treatments between FVNI and FVOCI investments. This could
lead to earnings management, if care is not taken to ensure that these differences are
considered solely for the purpose of managing net income to get higher bonuses, or fall
under the radar regarding any restrictive covenants (for example, net income minimum
thresholds set by creditors as performance targets). These differences also have to be
taken into account when analyzing investment portfolio performance.
FVOCI (with recycling) – Investments in Debt
FVOCI investments for IFRS companies can also be debt, such as bonds. FVOCI shares
(no recycling) reports dividends in net income and unrealized gains in OCI until sold, at
which time the OCI corresponding to the shares sold are reclassified from OCI/AOCI

8.2. Non-Strategic Investments

311

to retained earnings. FVOCI debt (with recycling) reports interest in net income and
unrealized gains in OCI until sold. As the “with recycling” name suggests, when the debt
securities are sold, the corresponding OCI is recycled through net income.
Using the same example as for FVNI investments in bonds discussed earlier, where
Osterline Ltd. purchased 7%, 5-year Waterland bonds with a face value of $500,000.
On July 1, 2016, just after receiving the interest, Osterline sells the bonds at the market
rate of 107. Osterline’s journal entries from Jan 1, 2015 to July 1, 2016 classified as FVNI
are repeated below and compared with debt investments classified as FVOCI.

Note the similarities in accounting treatment between the FVNI and FVOCI classifications
for bonds. As was the case for the FVNI investment in shares, the investment is adjusted
to fair value at the reporting date. The difference between the two methods is the account
used for the fair value adjustment. For FVNI, the unrealized gain/loss is reported in net
income, whereas for FVOCI, the unrealized gain/loss is reported as Other Comprehensive
Income which is closed at each year-end to the AOCI account (an equity account), until
the investment is sold. Once sold, any unrealized gains/losses that relate to the sale of
this investment are now realized and are transferred from OCI to net income. This is
referred to as “with recycling” (through net income). Recall that FVOCI in equities do
not recycle through net income. It is for this reason that FVOCI investments in debt with
recycling must be evaluated for impairment which is discussed next.
Also note the order of the entries upon sale. The July 1 sales is comprised of two entries
above. The first entry is a combined entry that records the cash proceeds, removal of the
investment sold and any realized gain/loss through OCI. This is the same as the method
used for FVOCI equities. The second entry is a transfer of the OCI related to the sale
from OCI to net income. For FVOCI equities this entry is a reclassification from OCI to
retained earnings. This is an important distinction regarding the accounting treatment for
the FVOCI investments.
Because the entire investment was sold, the net income differed in the first and second
year between FVNI and FVOCI with recycling, but over two years, the net income was the
same for both. If only part of the investment been sold, the differences would be similar to
the example regarding FVOCI equities, with regard to balances in the OCI/AOCI account
compared to FVNI where all the gains/losses are reported through net income.
Impairment of Investments – FVOCI with recycling (Debt)
For FVOCI in debt investments, an evaluation is done starting at its acquisition date.
Under IFRS 9, impairment evaluation and measurement is based on expected losses,
and must now reflect the basic principles below:
• An unbiased evaluation over a range of probability-based possible outcomes
• Estimated revised cash flows are discounted to reflect time value of money

8.2. Non-Strategic Investments

313

• The evaluation and measurements are based on data from past, current and estimated future economic conditions, using reasonable and supportable information
without undue cost or effort at the reporting date

The last point suggests that a company does not need to identify every possible scenario when risks are low, and companies are encouraged to use modelling techniques to
simplify evaluations and impairment measurements of large low-risk portfolios.
Essentially how it works is that for each investment at acquisition, various potential default scenarios (where the debt owing is not paid when due) are identified. Expected
future cash flows are estimated for each scenario, which is multiplied by its probability of
occurring. These probability-based cash flows are summed, and the total is deemed as
the expected credit loss (ECL) for that investment. This is a separate evaluation and
measurement of impairment losses than fluctuations in the market.
These estimated cash flows can either be based on scenarios and probabilities of default
over the investment’s next 12 months (12-month ECL) from acquisition, if risk of default
is low, or over the investment’s lifetime (Lifetime ECL), if risk of default is higher. IFRS 9
identifies three approaches for receivables and investments:
• Credit adjusted approach – for investments that are impaired at acquisition, such as
deeply discounted investments from high risk investee companies. This approach
will apply only rarely. Evidence of high risk could be due to significant financial difficulties or potential bankruptcy, a history of defaults, a history of concessions granted
by creditors on previous debt, or economic downturns in the investee company’s
industry sector. This approach uses the cumulative change in Lifetime ECL.
• Simplified approach – this approach is intended specifically for trade receivables,
IFRS 15 contract assets and lease receivables where the financial instrument does
not contain a significant interest component. It is based on Lifetime ECL
• General approach – this approach applies to all other financial instruments not
covered in the first two approaches. It is based on a 12-month ECL unless the
credit risk increases significantly.
If the credit risk is high at the investment’s acquisition, the credit adjusted approach
with Lifetime ECL will apply, otherwise the general approach would be used with the
shorter 12-month ECL. The end-result is that every investment will have an ECL amount
associated with it. These risk-based cash flows are discounted using the historic interest
rate at acquisition, and compared to the carrying value of the debt investment at the
evaluation date. The carrying value of the investment (or an asset valuation account)
is reduced by the loss amount and recorded to net income. Below is a schedule that
illustrates a simple ECL calculation:

Management can include as many default scenarios as is appropriate. In this case,
there are three scenarios where management has identified potential defaults for this
investment. If at the first reporting date after acquisition the fair value of the investment is
$480,000, the entry to record the fair value change would be:

The unrealized loss of $15,750 is to adjust for changes in the market fluctuations that is
not due to an impairment, so it is recorded to OCI. The loss on impairment resulting from
the ECL calculation must be reported through net income. Compared to the previous
accounting standard (IAS 39), this results in an earlier recognition of an impairment loss
because it is recorded at the first reporting period after the investment acquisition. This
clearly could create more volatility in the income statement.
After the initial recognition, the ECL is adjusted up or down, through net income at each
reporting date as the probabilities of default change. Once the investment is collected,
the ECL will be reduced to zero and impairment recoveries will be reported through net
income. If default risk increases due to adverse changes in business conditions, not only
will the estimated cash flow shortages and probabilities increase, the increased credit
risk could result in a change from the simpler 12-month ECL to the Lifetime ECL if risk
becomes too high. If a default does occur, the ECL amount will equal the actual cash flow
shortage. In IFRS 9, there is a presumption that credit/default risk significantly increases
if contractual payments from the investee are more than 30 days past due.

8.2. Non-Strategic Investments

To summarize, assessing credit risk is only required for amortized cost and FVOCI debt
(with recycling). FVNI and FVOCI equities do not need to be evaluated for impairment
because they are always remeasured to fair value each reporting date. Evaluating and
measuring impairments requires considerable judgement and companies are encouraged
to establish an accounting policy regarding factors to consider when determining if increases in credit risk (ECL) is to be deemed as significant or not.

8.2.3 Amortized Cost Investments (AC)
For ASPE companies, either debt or equities that are not traded in an active market are
reported at amortized cost or cost respectively. Unlike investments acquired for short-term
profit such as FVNI investments, shares or bonds may be purchased as AC investments
for other reasons, such as to strengthen relationships with a supplier or an important
customer.
For IFRS companies, if the investment business model is to acquire investments to collect
the contractual cash flows of principal and interest, and there is no intention to sell,
investments in debt securities such as bonds are reported at their amortized cost at each
balance sheet date. Management intent is to hold these investments until maturity, so
debt instruments are included in this category. Equity investments have no set maturity
dates, therefore they are not classified as an AC investment. Even if equities such as
shares are not part of a quoted market system, IFRS states that fair values are still
normally determinable, making FVOCI equities (without recycling) the more appropriate
classification for unquoted equities.
Transactions costs are added to the investment (asset) account. AC investments are
reported as long-term assets unless they are expected to mature within twelve months of
the balance sheet date or the normal operating cycle.
To summarize the initial and subsequent measurements used for AC investments:
• Initial purchase is at cost (purchase price) which is also fair value on the purchase
date. Unlike FVNI investments, transaction fees are added to the investment (asset)
account. This is because AC investments are cost-based investments, so any fees
paid to acquire the asset are to be capitalized like property, plant, and equipment,
which are also cost-based purchases.
• Bond interest and share dividends declared are reported in net income as realized.
Any premium or discount is amortized to the investment asset using the effective
interest rate method (IFRS). For ASPE companies, they can choose between the
effective interest rate method and the straight-line method.
• If the investment is impaired, determine the impairment amount. For ASPE the

316

Intercorporate Investments

impairment amount is the higher of: a) the present value of impaired future cash
flows at the current market interest rate, and b) net realizable value through sale (or
sale of collateral). ASPE allows for reversals of impairment. For IFRS, refer to the
Impairment section above in the FVOCI debt (with recycling).
• Report the investment at its carrying value at each reporting date, net of any impairment. As asset valuation account can be used instead of recording the impairment
loss directly to the investment account.
• When the investment is sold, remove the related accounts from the books. For debt
instruments, ensure that any interest, amortization or possible impairment recovery
is updated before calculating the gain/loss on sale prior to its removal from the
books. The difference between the carrying value and the net sales proceeds
is reported as a gain/loss on sale (including full or partial recovery of a previous
impairment, if applicable) and reported in net income.

AC Investments in Debt
In the previous sections discussing FVNI and FVOCI investments, Osterline purchased
Waterland bonds on the January 1, 2015, the interest payment date. Assume now that
Osterline classified this as an AC investment. The entries would be the same as illustrated
earlier for the FVNI category, except to exclude any fair value adjustments.

Note that the entry to the investment account for the sale of Waterland bonds for the
FVNI or FVOCI methods shown earlier is $508,027 compared to AC method above for
$515,577. The reason for this difference is due to the fair value adjustment for $7,550 for
the FVNI and FVOCI methods (both fair-value based) but not done for AC method which
is based on amortized cost.

AC Investments in Bonds – Between Interest Dates
What if the debt investment is purchased in between interest payment dates? Below is
an example of the accounting treatment for an AC investment in bonds that is purchased
between interest payment dates.
On March 1, 2015, Trimliner Co. purchases 6%, 5-year bonds of Zimmermann Inc. with a
face value of $700,000. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1. The market rate for a

318

Intercorporate Investments

bond with similar characteristics and risks is 6.48%. The bond is purchased for $685,843
cash. Stated another way, the bond is purchased at 98 ($685,843÷$700,000) on March 1,
2015. On December 31, 2015 year-end, the fair value of the bond at year-end is $710,000.
Trimliner follows IFRS and intends to hold the investment to collect the contractual cash
flows of principal and interest and to hold until maturity (AC classification).
Note that the purchase date of March 1 falls in between interest payments on January 1
and July 1. The business practice regarding bond interest payments is for the bond issuer
to pay the full six months interest to the bond holder throughout the life of the bond. This
creates a much simpler bond interest payment process for the bond issuer, but it creates
an issue for the purchaser since they are only entitled to the interest from the purchase
date to the next interest date, or four months in this case, as illustrated below.

This issue is easily resolved. The purchaser includes in the cash paid any interest that
has accrued between the last interest payment date on January 1 and the purchase date
on March 1, or two months. In other words, the purchaser adds to the cash payment
any interest that they are not entitled to receive. Later, when they receive the full six
months of interest on July 1 for $21,000, the net amount received will be for the four-month
period that was earned, which was from the purchase date on March 1 to the next interest
payment on July 1 as shown above.
In this example, the purchase price of $685,843 is lower than the face value of $700,000,
so the bonds are purchased at a discount.
The entry to record the investment for Trimliner, including the interest adjustment on March
1, 2015 and the first interest payment on July 1, 2015, is shown below. Note that the
discount is also amortized from the date of the purchase of bonds to the end of the interest
period.

As previously stated, ASPE companies can choose to use either the effective interest
or the straight-line method to amortize premiums or discounts. If straight-line method is
used, the discount for $14,157 ($700,000 − 685,843) will be amortized over five years.
The amortization amount for the July 1 entry would be for four months or $944 ($14,157 ÷
5 years × 4 ÷ 12). After that, the amortization will be for every six months or $1,416
($14,157 ÷ 5 × 6 ÷ 12).

AC Impairment
For IFRS companies, the process to evaluate and measure impairments was already
discussed in FVOCI debt (with recycling). The accounting treatment for impairments
(IFRS) is the same for both FVOCI debt with recycling and AC.
This section will now discuss impairment for ASPE companies with AC investments.
Since AC investments are measured at amortized cost for bonds and cost for shares,
there is always the possibility of an impairment loss since fair values are not used. For
this reason, investments should be assessed at the end of each reporting period to see
if there has been a loss event. Investment assets should be evaluated on both an individual investment and portfolio (grouped) investment basis to minimize any possibilities of
hidden impairments within a portfolio of investments with similar risks. Below are details
regarding how impairments for AC investments are measured:
ASPE—reduce the investment carrying value to the higher of:
• the present value of impaired future cash flows using the current market interest
rate and
• the net realizable value either through sale or by exercising the entity’s rights to sell
any collateral.
The loss is reported in net income and the investment (or an asset valuation allowance)
is reduced accordingly. These impairments may be reversed.
For example, assume that Vairon Ltd. purchased an investment in Forsythe Ltd. bonds for
$200,000 at par value on January 1 and intends to hold them until maturity. The bonds
pay interest on December 31 of each year. At year-end, Forsythe experiences cash flow
problems that are considered by the investor as a loss event that triggers an impairment
evaluation. The following cash flows are identified:
Present value of impaired cash flows using the current market rate
Net realizable value either through sale or by exercising
the investor’s rights to sell any collateral

Changes in Classifications
Changes in management’s intention to sell or hold to maturity can result in a change in
classification. However, earlier in this chapter some significant impacts in net income
and investment asset values were illustrated between FVNI, FVOCI, and AC methods.
It is easy to see how this might lead to manipulation of net income or asset values
by management. To minimize this possibility, for ASPE, no reclassification is permitted
unless there’s a change in the company’s business model, which happens very rarely.
For IFRS, there is the fair value option discussed earlier for FVOCI equities, which is
irrevocable.

8.3 Strategic Investments
In the previous categories, investments in other companies’ debt or shares were acquired
in order to make a return on idle cash. Investing in other companies can also be for
strategic purposes, such as to acquire the power to influence the board of directors
and company policies, or to take over control of the company outright. This is done by
acquiring various amounts of another company’s voting common shares. The degree of
ownership (number of votes) defines the level of influence.

(Significant Influence)
20% - 50% ownership

Subsidiary
(Control)

Joint Arrangements

322

Intercorporate Investments

Guidelines have been developed to help determine the classification of the investment
based on the degree of influence. For example, the previous three categories of investments (FVNI, FVOCI, and AC) each assumed that the investor’s ownership in shares were
less than 20%, therefore having no influence on the investee company.
For ownership in shares greater than 20% but less than 50%, it is assumed that significant influence exists. IFRS calls this category investment in associates. However,
if an investing company owns between 20% and 50% of another company’s shares,
significant influence is by no means assured and can be refuted, if there is evidence to
the contrary. For example, if an investor acquires 40% of the outstanding common shares
of a company but the remaining 60% of the shares are held by one other investor, then
significant influence will not exist. A general assumption is that the greater the number
of investors, the more likely that investment holdings of greater than 20% will result in
significant influence.
If an investor holds greater than 50% of the common shares, then it has the majority
of the votes at the board of directors’ meetings, thereby having control of the investee
company’s operations, decisions and policies.
Joint arrangements is another type of strategic investment that involves the contractuallyagreed sharing of control by two or more investors. There are two types of joint arrangements, namely; joint operations and joint ventures. A joint operation exists if the investor
has rights to the assets and unlimited liability obligations of the joint entity and a joint
venture exists if the investor has rights to net assets (assets and limited liability obligations
of the joint entity.
Regarding strategic investments—why would an investor want to influence or control
another company? If the investee company has resources that would enhance the operations of the investor, then acquiring sufficient voting shares to significantly influence or
control the investee’s board of directors would be a prime motivator to do so. Acquiring an
interest in another company could secure a guaranteed source of materials and products,
open up new markets, or broaden existing ones for the investor company. It could also
expand an investor company’s range of products and services available for sale as was
the case with Hewlett Packard’s acquisition of 87% of Autonomy Corporation’s shares
resulting in control of the company.
The accounting treatments for these classifications are complex and will be covered in
more detail in the advanced accounting courses. The rest of this chapter will focus on an
introduction to the three strategic investment classifications.

8.3. Strategic Investments

323

8.3.1 Investments in Associates (Significant Influence)
For IFRS, investments between 20% and 50% of the voting shares in another company
are reported using the equity method. For ASPE companies, management can choose
the equity method, the fair value through net income method (if this investment is traded in
an active market), or the cost method if no market exists. Transactions costs are expensed
for the equity and fair value methods and added to the investment (asset) account for
the cost method. Investments in associates are reported as long-term investments and
income from associates is to be separately disclosed.
This chapter has already discussed the fair value and cost models, so the focus will now
be on the equity method.
The equity method initially records the shares at the cost of acquiring them which is also
fair value. Subsequent measurement of the investment account includes recording the
proportionate share of the investee’s:

• net income (loss) adjusted for any inter-company transactions
• dividends
• amortization of any fair value difference in the investee’s capital assets
• impairments, if any
• proceeds of sale

The equity method is often referred to as the one-line consolidation because all the
related transactions are recorded as increases or decreases in a single investment asset
account. For example, if the investee company reported net income, this would result
in a proportionate increase in the investor’s investment (asset) due to the added profit.
Conversely, a net loss reported or dividend received would be recorded as a proportionate
decrease in the investment. Any amortization of fair value adjustments from the date of
purchase or impairment would also be recorded as a decrease in the investment account.
Below is an example of how the investment is accounted for using the equity method.
On January 1, 2015, Tilton Co. purchased 25% of the 100,000 outstanding common
shares of Beaton Ltd. for $455,000. Beaton currently is one of Tilton’s suppliers of
manufactured goods. The outstanding shares are widely held, so with this purchase,
Tilton can exercise significant influence over Beaton. This investment solidified the relationship between Tilton and will guarantee a steady supply of goods needed by Tilton for
its customers. The following financial information relates to Beaton:

On December 31, Tilton recorded its 25% share of dividends received, net income (loss),
and amortization of Beaton’s net depreciable assets. But what about the $80,000 excess
paid for the investment? The excess of $60,000 relates to Beaton’s net depreciation
assets, so this portion of the excess is amortized over ten years. The remaining $20,000
is inexplicable, so it will be treated as unrecorded goodwill. Goodwill is discussed in
detail in Chapter 11: Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Since there is unrecorded goodwill,
an intangible asset, Tilton must evaluate its investment each reporting date to determine
if there has been any impairment in the investment’s value.
Below is a partial balance sheet and income statement reporting the investment at December 31, 2015.

*($455,000 − 37,500 + 62,500 − 6,000)

For IFRS, investments in this classification are assessed each balance sheet date for
possible impairment. If it was determined that the investment’s recoverable amount—
being the higher of its value in use (the present value of expected cash flows from holding
the investment, discounted at the current market rate) and fair value less costs to sell,
both of which are discounted cash flow concepts—was $460,000, then the carrying value
is more than the recoverable amount and an impairment loss of $14,000 ($460,000 −
474,000) is recorded as a reduction to the investment (or valuation account) and to net
income (loss).

For ASPE, impairment evaluation and measurement is the same as IFRS except “fair
value” does not include netting the costs to sell.
Since there is $20,000 of unrecorded goodwill, the $14,000 impairment charge represents a loss in an intangible asset and is therefore not reversible. If there had been no
unrecorded goodwill, any subsequent impairment charge would be reversible, but limited
and the recovery amount could not result in a carrying value balance greater than if there
had been no impairment.

8.3.2 Investments in Subsidiaries (Control)
For IFRS, investments greater than 50% of the voting shares in another company are
reported using the consolidation method. For ASPE companies, there is a choice of consolidation, equity, or cost methods. Transactions costs are expensed for the consolidation
and equity methods and added to the investment (asset) account for the cost method.
For IFRS companies, the investor is referred to as the parent, and the investee as the
subsidiary, and it is reasonable to treat the two companies as one economic unit and
prepare a consolidated set of financial reports for the combined entity. This means that the

326

Intercorporate Investments

investment account is eliminated and 100% of each asset and liability of the subsidiary is
reported within the parent company’s balance sheet on a line-by-line basis. For example,
the accounts receivable ending balance for the subsidiary would be added to the accounts
receivable balance of the parent and reported as a single amount on the consolidated
balance sheet. This would be done for all of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities sheet
accounts. As well, 100% of each of the subsidiary’s revenues, expenses, gains, and
losses accounts would be included with those of the parent company and reported in the
consolidated income statement.
Since 100% of all the net assets and net income (loss) is being reported by the parent,
any percentage of ownership held by outside investors, referred to as the minority interest,
must also be reported in the financial statements. This is reported as a single line in the
balance sheet and the income statement as non-controlling interest. For example, in
the cover story, Hewlett Packard purchased a majority of the voting shares of Autonomy
Corp. The remaining percentage would be the minority interest shareholders who did
not sell their shares to Hewlett Packard and continue to be investors of Autonomy Corp.
This non-controlling interest would be reported as a single line in the balance sheet and
the income statement. Earlier chapters regarding the income statement and statement
of financial position both illustrate how the non-controlling interest is presented in these
financial statements.

8.3.3 Investments in Joint Arrangements
As previously stated in the overview of strategic investments, joint arrangements is another type of strategic investment for both IFRS and ASPE that involves a contractual
arrangement between two or more investors regarding control of a joint entity. Control
in this case means that the investors must together agree on the decision-making. For
IFRS, there are two types of joint arrangements:

• Joint operations—investor has direct rights to assets and (unlimited) liability obligations of the joint entity, such as a partnership where liability can be unlimited. Each
investor would include in their financial statements the assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses that they have a direct interest in. In other words, it is a form of
proportionate consolidation where the investor’s proportionate share of the assets,
liabilities, revenue and expense accounts from the joint entity are added to the
investor’s existing accounts.
• Joint ventures—investor has rights to net assets (assets and (limited) liability obligations) of the joint entity, such as the case involving corporations with limited liability.
The equity method is used for this type of investment which is the method illustrated
for investments in associates above. In this case, the joint entity is shown on a net
basis in an investment account on the statement of financial position.

8.4. Investments Disclosures

327

The ASPE standards are very similar, though the terms are a bit different, namely, jointly
controlled operations, jointly controlled assets, and jointly controlled enterprises. ASPE
companies can make a policy choice to use proportionate consolidation, equity, or cost to
account for their joint entity investments. Once chosen, the method must be applied to all
investments of this nature.

8.4 Investments Disclosures
Reporting disclosures were addressed under each accounting method above. To summarize, investments will be reported as either current or long-term assets on the same
basis as other assets. If the investment is expected to be sold within twelve months
of the balance sheet date (or its operating cycle), is held for trading purposes, or is
a cash equivalent, it will be reported as a current asset. All other investments will be
reported as long-term assets. Both IFRS and ASPE companies are similar regarding
this classification. IFRS and ASPE standards are also similar regarding the disclosure
objectives for investments for the following reasons:
• to ensure that information is available to assess the level of significance of the overall
financial position and performance of the investments
• to understand the nature and extent of risks arising from the investments
• to know how these risks are managed
Examples of disclosure details are:
• separation of investments by type (i.e., FVNI, AC, FVOCI, Significant Influence,
Subsidiary, Joint arrangements)
• the carrying value of investments with details about their respective fair values including valuation techniques, interest income, unrealized and realized gains (losses),
impairments and reversals of impairments, and reclassifications
• information from the legal documents including maturity dates, interest rates, and
collateral
• information regarding market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk, as well as the policies
in place to manage risks
• IFRS for impaired assets must disclose the basis for the ECL and changes in ECL
as well as a breakdown and reconciliation of the reporting year’s adjustments of any
impairment allowance accounts

328

Intercorporate Investments

Since investments are also financial instruments, the disclosure requirements identified
in Chapter 6: Cash and Receivables apply to intercorporate investments as well. Refer to
that chapter for more details.

8.5 Investments Analysis
Access to the information contained in financial statements and required disclosures is vital to sound investment analysis. This information will assist management to separate the
assets, liabilities, and income components of the investment portfolios from the company’s
core operations to accurately assess performance of the company and of the investment
itself. As well, creditors and potential investors will have to keep in mind the impact that
certain accounting treatments would have on existing financial data. The equity method
was referred to earlier as the one-line consolidation method for a reason: some of the key
data using this method is not separately identifiable. As well, the accounting treatment
chosen could affect the amounts and timing of net income and assets balances reported
by the investor company. Some of these differences are identified in the chapter highlights
below. Decisions regarding when to purchase or sell are in part determined by analysis
of the investee company’s operating results, earnings prospects, and earnings ratios.
For this reason, care must be taken to clearly be aware of any obscured data and to
understand the differences in data created by the choice of accounting treatments for
each investment portfolio. Proper access to information and a thorough understanding of
the various accounting treatments will reduce the possibility that management will make
sub-optimal business investment decisions due to misinterpretation of analysis results.

8.6 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
There is no doubt that accounting for investments is complex, given the presence of two
accounting standards that have identified eight separate categories for IFRS and ASPE
as shown in the Classifications chart at the beginning of this chapter.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe intercorporate investments and their role in
accounting and business.
Non-strategic intercorporate investments exist when companies invest in other companies’ equity (shares or derivatives) or debt (bonds or convertible debt) to earn a better

330

Intercorporate Investments

return on their idle cash. These returns will take the form of interest income, dividend
income, or capital appreciation of the security itself.
Strategic intercorporate investments are voting shares purchased by the investor company to enhance its own operations. The goal is to either influence the investee’s board
of directors (share holdings 20% or greater) or to take control over the company (share
holdings 50% or greater). This is undertaken in order to guarantee a source of scarce materials or services or to increase sales and hence profit. There are also joint arrangements
where two or more investors, through a contractual agreement, control a joint entity.
Intercorporate investments are financial assets because the investor’s contractual rights to
receive cash or other assets of the investee company result in a financial liability or equity
instrument of the investee. They are reported as either current or long-term investments
depending on the investments business model and if management intends to hold and
collect interest and dividends or to realize changes in their value through selling them.
For all investments, the initial measurement is the acquisition price (which is equal to the
fair value) in Canadian funds. For equity investments this would likely be the market price
and for debt investments such as bonds, it would be the future cash flows discounted
using the market interest rate (net present value). Subsequent measurement will depend
on the category of the investment. For non-strategic investments, IFRS has three categories: a) FVNI for trading and measured at fair value through net income; b) AC to hold
and collect cash flows and measured at amortized cost; and c) FVOCI to collect cash flows
and to sell, measured at fair value through OCI with recycling (debt) or without recycling
(equities). ASPE has two categories: a) investments for trading purposes (FVNI); and
b) all other investments at cost or amortized cost. Strategic investments have three
categories: a) holdings of 20% or greater (associate or significant influence) which uses
the equity method (IFRS); b) holdings of 50% or greater (subsidiary or control) which
uses consolidation (IFRS); and c) joint arrangements made up of various percentages,
using the equity method for joint ventures or a form of proportionate consolidation for joint
operations. ASPE allows some other choices of methods for its strategic investments and
permits straight-line amortization of its debt instruments. The ownership percentages are
guidelines only and there can be exceptions to these.

LO 2: Identify and describe the three types of non-strategic
investments.
Held-for-trading (FVNI) investments in debt, equity, or derivatives are held for short periods of time. For ASPE companies, these are for equities trading in an active market, debt,
or most derivatives under the fair value option (classification irrevocable, once made).
FVNI investments are reported as current assets at fair value through net income at
each balance sheet date. Transaction costs are expensed. Gains (losses) upon sale are

Chapter Summary

331

reported in net income. Since they are reported at fair value, no separate impairment tests
or charges are required. Investor companies often use an asset valuation allowance account (contra account to the investment asset) to record changes in fair value to preserve
the original cost information for the investment. For debt instruments such as bonds, any
amortization is calculated using the effective interest method for IFRS. ASPE companies
can also elect to use straight-line method for its amortization.
FVOCI investments in debt or equity are for sale, but also for the purpose of collecting the cash flows of interest and dividends. This classification is only available for
IFRS companies. They are reported as long-term assets (until within twelve months
of the intention to sell them) at fair value through OCI at each balance sheet date until
sold. Transactions costs are capitalized. For FVOCI investments in debt, gains/losses
upon sale are transferred from OCI to net income. For FVOCI investments in equities,
gains/losses upon sale are reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings. Impairment
evaluations begin as soon as the investment is acquired and estimated costs regarding
potential defaults (expected credit losses or ECL) are calculated and reported at the first
reporting date after acquisition. The ECL is adjusted up or down depending on if credit
risk increasing or decreasing.
For IFRS, AC investments in debt are reported at amortized cost at each balance sheet
date. ASPE companies can also classify equity securities not traded in an active market
to this category at cost. Transaction costs are capitalized. AC investments are reported
at their carrying value as long-term assets, unless they are expected to mature within
twelve months of the balance sheet date. Interest earned on investments in debt (bonds),
and dividends earned on equity securities measured at cost, are reported in net income.
Any bond premium or discount amortization is calculated using the effective interest rate
method for IFRS companies. ASPE can choose to use either the effective interest or the
straight-line method. For ASPE, if a loss event occurs, any impairment is calculated as the
difference between the carrying value and the present value of the impaired cash flows
using the current market rate. Any gain (loss) due to impairment or upon sale is reported
in net income. An asset valuation allowance can be used for either standard and any of
the classifications.
For IFRS, impairment evaluations for AC investments are the same process as for FVOCI
debt. To summarize, impairment evaluations begin as soon as the AC investment is
acquired and estimated costs regarding potential defaults (expected credit losses or ECL)
are calculated and reported at the first reporting date after acquisition. The ECL is
adjusted up or down depending on if credit risk increasing or decreasing.

LO 3: Identify an describe the three types of strategic investments.
Investments in the voting shares of an investee company are undertaken to influence or
take over control of the board of directors. The degree of ownership defines the level of

332

Intercorporate Investments

influence and the classification.
Associate (Significant Influence) investments of 20% or greater voting shares are reported using the equity method for IFRS. For ASPE, management can choose the equity
method, the fair value method through net income if traded in an active market, or the cost
method if no market exists. Transaction costs are expensed for the equity and fair value
methods and added to the investment (asset) account for the cost method. Investments
in associates are reported as long-term investments and income from associates is to
be separately disclosed on the income statement. The equity method is based on a
reflection of ownership in the investee company. Dividends received are treated as a
return of some of the investment asset and are recorded as a reduction in the value of
the investment. Conversely, the investor company’s share of an associate’s reported net
income is added to the value of the investment. Included in the journal entries are also any
excess amount paid that is attributable to the investee’s net identifiable assets amortized
over the remaining life of the assets. Any remaining excess is usually attributable to
unrecorded goodwill. Any impairment charge other than those attributed to unrecorded
goodwill is recoverable, but limited.
Investments in subsidiaries (Control) for greater than 50% of the voting shares in another
company are reported using the consolidation method for IFRS. For ASPE companies,
there is a choice of consolidation, equity, or cost methods. Transaction costs are expensed
for the consolidation and equity methods and added to the investment (asset) account for
the cost method. Consolidation involves the elimination of the investment account, and
100% of each asset and liability of the subsidiary is incorporated on a line-by-line basis
with the assets and liabilities of the parent company’s balance sheet. As well, 100% of
the revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are also incorporated on a line-by-line basis in
the parent company’s consolidated statement of income. If the parent company owns less
than 100%, then a minority interest held by other shareholders exists. This is reported as
a single line called non-controlling interest in the parent company’s consolidated balance
sheet and consolidated income statement.
The investments in joint arrangements classification is used when there are multiple
investors each having direct rights to the assets and obligations of the joint arrangement.
The degrees of ownership can be varying percentages, and are reported in each investor
company using the proportionate consolidation method for IFRS. For ASPE companies,
there is a choice of using proportionate consolidation, equity, or cost. The mechanics of
the proportionate consolidation method are similar to the consolidation method discussed
above.

Chapter Summary

333

LO 4: Explain disclosures requirements for intercorporate
investments.
The various classifications and accounting treatments can significantly impact the asset
values and net income of investor companies. Accounting methods in this chapter can
obscure some of the key data and stakeholders may have difficulty distinguishing between
performance of the investor’s core operations and those of its investments. Investment
decisions to buy or sell are based on this information so it is critical to be aware of any
obscured data that could influence these decisions.

LO 5: Identify the issues for stakeholders regarding investment
analyses of performance.
Analyzing the performance of a company’s portfolio of intercorporate investments is a
critical process. The most significant hurdle to good investment management is to ensure that the information used to assess performance is clearly understood by those
performing the analysis and interpreting the results, since some of the critical data can
be obscured by the choice of accounting treatment. Investments have three potential
accounting categories for both non-strategic (FVNI, FVOCI, AC) and strategic (associate,
control, joint arrangements) investments. As well, accounting treatments can also vary
between debt instruments and equity securities within a specific classification, making
comparisons with other benchmark data (e.g., historic or industry ratios) difficult, and
hence performance assessment challenging as well. The result is that both net income
and investment accounts balances can differ widely at each reporting date depending on
the category classification chosen to account for the investment(s).

LO 6: Discuss the similarities and differences between IFRS and
ASPE for the three non-strategic investment classifications.
A decision map assists in determining the proper treatment for various types of investment
decisions.

On January 1, 2015, Helsinky Co. paid cash to acquire 8% bonds of Britanica Corp. with a
maturity value of $250,000, to mature January 1, 2023. The bonds provide a 9% yield and
pay interest each December 31. Helsinky purchased these bonds as part of its trading
portfolio and accounts for the bonds as FVNI investments. On December 31, 2015, the
bonds had a fair value of $240,000. Helsinky follows ASPE and has a December 31
year-end.
During 2016, the industry sector that Britanica operates in experienced some difficult
times due to the drop in international market prices for oil and gas. As a result, by
December 31, 2016, their debt was downgraded to the market price of 87.3. By December
31, 2017, the bond had a market price of 92.3. In 2018, conditions improved measurably,
resulting in the bonds having a fair value on December 31, 2018 of 99.3.

EXERCISE 8–15
On January 1, 2009, Billings Ltd. purchased 2,500 shares of Outlander Holdings for
$87,500. During the time that this investment has been held by Billings, the economy
and the investee company Outlander have experienced many good and bad times. In
2015, Outlander stated that it was experiencing a reduction in profits but was trying to get
things to improve.
Required:
a. Assume that Billings applies the cost method to this investment because there is
no active market for Outlander shares. In 2014, Billings had a general sense that
the value of its investment in Outlander had probably dropped by about 8.6% to
$80,000. This was not enough to trigger an impairment evaluation as it was still

342

Intercorporate Investments

uncertain. By 2015, seeing no improvement, Billings’ management completed an
evaluation of the investment and estimated that the discounted cash flows from this
investment was now $50,000.
Prepare the entries for 2014 and 2015, assuming that Billings follows ASPE.
b. Next, assume that Billings classifies the investment as a FVNI. By the end of 2014,
the price of Outlander shares had fallen from $34.00 the previous year to $32.00.
By 2015, the price had dropped to a 52-week low of $25.00 per share.
Prepare the entries for 2014 and 2015, assuming that Billings follows ASPE.
c. Finally, assume that Billings follows IFRS and had purchased the shares of Outlander because Billings wanted to collect the dividends and sell them to realize the
change in the shares’ valuation. For this reason, Billings classified the investment as
a FVOCI investment. How might the accounting treatment change due to a change
to IFRS and FVOCI?

EXERCISE 8–16
On January 1, 2015, Sandar Ltd. purchased 32% of Yarder Co.’s 50,000 outstanding

fair value of $23. Sandar’s year-end is December 31 and follows ASPE.
Required:
a. Assuming that Sandar does not have any significant influence over Yarder, prepare
all the 2015 entries relating to this investment using the FVNI classification.
b. Prepare all the 2015 entries relating to this investment if it was classified as cost due
to no active markets.
c. Prepare all the 2015 entries relating to this investment assuming that Sandar has
significant influence over Yarder. Sandar uses the equity method of accounting.

Below are details for several independent investments:
i. Preferred shares were purchased from a publicly traded company because of their
favourable dividend payout history. They are for sale, but management has no
specific intention to sell at this time.
ii. On February 1, 2015, 10% or 1,400 shares of the total outstanding shares were
purchased from another company that is a privately-held corporation. Management
intends to acquire 30% of the total outstanding shares.
iii. The company has an investment in 10-year bonds which will mature in 5 more years.
Management’s intention was to hold them until maturity but the company is short of
cash, so a possibility exists that they may be sold in 2015, though that is not certain
at this point.
iv. Common shares of a supplier company were purchased to strengthen their relationship. Management intends to hold this investment into the future.
v. On January 1, 2015, a 4% bond that will mature in 6 years was purchased at market
price of 92. When the price point reaches 103, management intends to sell the
investment.
vi. Bonds that mature in 10 years were purchased with monies set aside for a new
building purchase expected to occur in 10 years. The bonds will be sold once they
mature.
vii. On March 1, 2015, bonds maturing in 2016 were purchased.

Winter in Hawaii!
In July 2014, WestJet Airlines Ltd. (WestJet) announced that it planned to purchase
four Boeing 767-300ERW aircraft to continue and enhance its service from Alberta
to Hawaii. These flights had previously been offered through an arrangement with
another airline. This represented a significant investment by the company, as each
Boeing 767 sells for approximately $191 million. The company had previously
announced in March 2014 that it had placed an order for an additional five Bombardier
Q400 NextGen aircraft. Aside from these orders, the company had also taken delivery
of five other Q400 NextGen aircraft and two Boeing 737NG 800s in the first half of
2014. The company’s total fleet of aircraft in mid-2014 was 120 units, but the company
indicated that it planned to expand the fleet to approximately 200 units by 2027.
Clearly, aircraft equipment is a significant asset for an airline. In WestJet’s case,
the total carrying value of all its property and equipment at June 30, 2014 was
approximately $2.7 billion. This represented approximately 66% of the company’s total
asset base. The bulk of the company’s investment in equipment was comprised of
aircraft ($1.9 billion) and deposits on aircraft ($0.5 billion). For any financial statement
reader or decision maker, it is important to gain a clear understanding of the nature of
this significant asset class in WestJet.
WestJet reports that their aircraft equipment is actually comprised of several
components. These components include the aircraft itself—the engine, airframe,
and landing gear components—and the live satellite television equipment. Each
component is depreciated over different periods of time, ranging from five to twenty
years. In addition to the aircraft equipment, the company depreciates other property
and equipment, such spare engines, ground property, buildings, and leasehold
improvements over periods ranging from three to forty years. It is evident that
understanding the nature and identification of components is an important accounting
function in a company like WestJet.
In the company’s accounting policy note, it is stated that the identification of
components is based on management’s judgment of what constitutes a significant
cost in relation to the total cost of an asset. As well, it states that management
considers the patterns of consumption and useful lives of the assets when identifying
reportable components. The accounting policy note further states that most overhaul
expenditures are capitalized and depreciated.

As WestJet continues to expand its fleet into new types of aircraft, it will be important
for management to consider their accounting policies carefully with respect to their
property and equipment. With such a significant investment in non-current assets,
accounting decisions regarding the identification of asset components can have a
profound effect on reported income. A sound understanding of the criteria and
principles behind capitalization of property, plant, and equipment assets is essential
to understanding WestJet.

Introduction
The rapid development of information technology in recent decades has highlighted the
importance of intellectual capital. The future of commerce, we are told, lies in the development of ideas, processes, and brands. Yet, even with this change in focus from a
traditional manufacturing economy, the importance of the physical assets of a business
cannot be ignored. Even companies like Facebook and Google still need computers to run
their applications, desks and chairs for staff to sit in, or buildings to house their operations.
And even as the knowledge economy grows, there continues to be an increasing variety
of consumer products being manufactured and sold. All of this activity requires capacity,
and this capacity is provided by the property, plant, and equipment of a business.

Key Differences

9.1 Definition
The computers, furniture, buildings, land, factory equipment, and so forth that a business
owns are called its hard assets, also sometimes referred to as fixed assets or capital
assets. But the term that is consistently used in the IFRS publications is property, plant,
and equipment (PPE).
According to IAS 16.6, under IFRS property, plant, and equipment are the tangible items
that are:

9.2. Recognition

351

• held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or
for administrative purposes
• expected to be used during more than one period (IAS, 2003a)

A key element of the definition is that the item be tangible. This means that it must have a
physical substance; therefore, it does not include items of an intangible nature, such as a
copyright. The intended use of the asset is also important, as it is expected that it be used
for some productive purpose and not simply resold to a customer. This distinction of intent
is important. An automobile held by a car dealership would be considered inventory, as
the dealership intended to resell it; whereas, an automobile owned by a rental company
would be considered PPE, as the intended use is earning revenue from rentals. The
definition also suggests that the asset should be useful to the business for more than one
accounting period. Although this means that a tangible, productive asset with a useful life
of two years would be considered PPE, many PPE items have lives much longer than this.
A property that includes land and a manufacturing facility could be useful to a business
for thirty or forty years, or even longer. The long-term, productive assets of a business
are sometimes referred to as bricks and mortar, suggesting something of the relatively
permanent nature of these assets.

9.2 Recognition
According to IAS 16.7, a PPE item should be recognized when:

• It is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
entity.
• The item’s cost can be measured reliably (IAS 2003a).

Notice that these conditions are similar to our basic definition of an asset. Also notice that
the definition is phrased in terms of economic benefits, rather than of the item itself. This
means that some expenditures not directly incurred to purchase the asset, but necessary
nonetheless to guarantee the continued productive use of the asset, may still be included
in the asset’s cost. For example, safety equipment mandated by legislation may not
provide direct revenue to the business, but is necessary in order to continue operating
the equipment legally. Thus, these costs should be capitalized as part of the asset’s cost,
and if significant, may even be identified as a separate component of the asset.
The definition of PPE does not contain any guidance on how to define an individual
element of PPE. This means that the accountant will need to apply professional judgment

352

Property, Plant, and Equipment

to determine the segregation of various PPE components. If we consider a large, complex
piece of equipment such as an airplane, the need for proper component accounting
becomes clear. An airplane contains several major elements: the fuselage, the engines,
and the interior fixtures (seats, galley, and so on). As indicated in the opening story
about WestJet, each of these elements may have a significantly different useful life, and
may require maintenance and replacement at different intervals. Because we need to
depreciate assets based on their useful lives, and because we need to consider the
accounting treatment of subsequent expenditures, it is important to define the separate
components of a PPE item properly at the time of recognition. Accountants will usually
consider the value of the component relative to the whole asset, along with the useful life
and other qualitative and practical factors when making these determinations.
IAS 16 also indicates that spare parts, stand-by equipment, and servicing equipment
should be recognized as property, plant, and equipment if they meet the definition. If they
don’t meet the definition, then it is more appropriate to classify these items as inventory.
This is an area where materiality and the accountant’s professional judgment will come
into play, as the capitalization of these items may not always be practical.

9.3 Measurement at Recognition
PPE assets are initially measured at their cost, which is the cash or fair value of other
assets given to acquire the asset. A few key inclusions and exclusions need to be
considered in this definition.
Any cost required to purchase the asset and bring it to its location of operation should
be capitalized. As well, any further costs required to prepare the asset for its intended
use should also be capitalized. The following is a list of some of the costs that should be
included in the capitalized amount:
• Purchase price, including all non-recoverable tax and duties, net of discounts
• Delivery and handling
• Direct employee labour costs to construct or acquire the asset
• Site preparation
• Other installation costs
• Net material and labour costs required to test the asset for proper functionality
• Professional fees directly attributable to the purchase
• Estimates of decommissioning and site restoration costs

9.3. Measurement at Recognition

353

Costs that should not be included in the initial capitalized amount include:

• Initial operating losses
• Training costs for employees
• Costs of opening a new facility
• Costs of introducing a new product or service
• Costs of reorganization and operation at a new location
• Administration and general overhead costs
• Other revenue or expenses that are incidental to the development of the PPE

9.3.1 Self-Constructed Assets
When a company chooses to build its own PPE, further accounting problems may arise.
Without a transaction with an external party, the cost of the asset may not be clear.
Although the direct materials and labour needed to construct the asset are usually easy to
identify, the costs of overheads and other indirect elements may be more difficult to apply.
The general rule to apply here is that only costs directly attributable to the construction
of the asset should be capitalized. This means that any allocation of general overheads
or other indirect costs is not appropriate. As well, any internal profits or abnormal costs,
such as material wastage, are excluded from the capitalized amount.

9.3.2 Borrowing Costs
One particular problem that arises when a company constructs its own PPE is how to
treat any interest incurred during the construction phase. IAS 23 (IAS, 2007) requires
that any interest that is directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset be
capitalized. A qualifying asset is any asset that takes a substantial amount of time to be
prepared for its intended use. This definition could thus include inventories as well as
PPE, although the standard does not require capitalization of interest for inventory items
that are produced in large quantities on a regular basis.
If a PPE asset is qualified under this definition, then a further question arises as to how
much interest should be capitalized. The general rule is that any interest that could have
been avoided by not constructing the asset should be capitalized. If the company has
obtained specific financing for the project, then the direct interest costs should be easy to

354

Property, Plant, and Equipment

identify. However, note that any interest revenue earned on excess funds that are invested
during the construction process should be deducted from the total amount capitalized.
If the project is financed from general borrowings and not a specific loan, identification
of the capitalized interest is more complicated. The general approach here is to apply a
weighted average cost of borrowing to the total project cost and capitalize this amount.
Some judgment will be required to determine this weighted average cost in large, complex
organizations.
Interest capitalization should commence when the company first incurs expenditures for
the asset, first incurs borrowing costs, and first undertakes activities necessary to prepare
the asset for its intended use. Interest capitalization should cease once substantially all of
the activities necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use are complete. Interest
capitalization should also be stopped if active development of the project is suspended for
an extended period of time.
Many aspects of the accounting standards for interest capitalization require professional
judgment, and accountants will need to be careful in applying this standard.

9.3.3 Asset Retirement Obligations
For certain types of PPE assets, the company may have an obligation to dismantle,
clean up, or restore the site of the asset once its useful life has been consumed. An
example would be a drilling site for an oil exploration company. Once the well has finished
extracting the oil from the reserve, local authorities may require the company to remove
the asset and restore the site to a natural state. Even if there is no legal requirement
to do so, the company may still have created an expectation that it will do so through
its own policies and previous conduct. This type of non-legally binding commitment is
referred to as a constructive obligation. Where these types of legal and constructive
obligations exist, the company is required to report a liability on the balance sheet equal
to the present value of these future costs, with the offsetting debit being record as part of
the capital cost of the asset. This topic will be covered in more detail in Chapter 10, but
for now, just be aware that this type of cost will be capitalized as part of the PPE asset
cost.

9.3.4 Lump Sum Purchases
There are instances where a business may purchase a group of PPE assets for a single
price. This is referred to as a lump sum, or basket, purchase. When this occurs, the
accounting issue is how to allocate the purchase price to the individual components
purchased. The normal practice is to allocate the purchase price based on the relative fair

9.3. Measurement at Recognition

355

value of each component. Of course, this requires that information about the assets’ fair
values be available and reliable. Often, insurance appraisals, property tax assessments,
depreciated replacement costs, and other appraisals can be used. The reliability and
suitability of the source used will be a matter of judgment on the part of the accountant.
Consider the following example. A company purchases land and building together for
a total price of $850,000. The most recent property tax assessment from the local
government indicated that the building’s assessed value was $600,000 and the land’s
assessed value was $150,000. The total purchase price of the components would be
allocated as follows:
Land
Building

150,000×850,000
(150,000+600,000)
600,000×850,000
(150,000+600,000)

Total

=

$170,000

=

$680,000

=

$850,000

9.3.5 Non-monetary Exchanges
When PPE assets are acquired through payments other than cash, the question that
arises is how to value the transaction. Two particular types of transactions can occur:
1) a company can acquire a PPE asset by issuing its own shares, or 2) a company can
acquire a PPE asset by exchanging it with another asset the company currently owns.
Asset Acquired by Issuing Shares
When a company issues its own shares to acquire an asset, the transaction should be
recorded at the fair value of the asset acquired. IFRS presumes that this fair value should
normally be obtainable. This makes sense, as it unlikely that a company would acquire
an asset without having a reasonable estimate of its value. If the fair value of the asset
acquired is not determinable, then the asset should be reported at the fair value of the
shares given up. This value is relatively easy to determine for an actively traded public
company. In cases where neither the value of the asset nor the value of the shares can
be reliably determined, the asset could not be recorded.
Asset Acquired in Exchange for Other Assets
When assets are acquired though exchange with other non-monetary assets or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets, the asset acquired should be valued at
the fair value of the assets given up. If this value cannot be reliably determined, then the
fair value of the asset received should be used. Notice how this differs from the rule for
share-based payments. The presumption is that the fair values of assets are generally
more reliable than the fair values of shares.

356

Property, Plant, and Equipment

The implication of this general rule is that when non-monetary assets are exchanged,
there will likely be a gain or loss recorded on the transaction, as fair values and carrying
values are usually not the same. The recognition of a gain or loss suggests that the
earnings process is complete for this asset. This seems reasonable, as each company
involved in the transaction would normally expect to receive some economic benefit from
the exchange.
There are two instances, however, where the general rule does not apply. These two
situations occur when:
• The fair values of both assets are not reliably measurable.
• The transaction lacks commercial substance.
Although it is an unusual situation, it is possible that the fair value of neither asset can
be reliably determined. In this case, the asset acquired would be recorded at the book
value of the asset given up. This means that no gain or loss would be recorded on the
transaction.
A more likely situation occurs when the transaction lacks commercial substance. This
means that after the exchange of the assets, the company’s economic position has not
been altered significantly. This condition can usually be determined by considering the
future cash flows resulting from the exchange. If the business is not expected to realize
any difference in the amount, timing, or risk of future cash flows, either directly or indirectly,
then there is no real change in its economic position. In this case, it would be unreasonable to recognize a gain, as there has been no completion of the earnings process. This
type of situation could occur, for example, when two companies want to change their
strategic directions, so they swap similar assets that may be located in different markets.
There may be no significant difference in cash flows, but the assets received by each
company are more suitable to their long-term plans. In this case, the asset acquired is
reported at the carrying value of the asset given up.
One instance where accountants need to be careful occurs when an asset exchange lacks
commercial substance and the carrying amount of the asset given up is greater than the
fair value of the asset acquired. If we apply the principle for non-commercial exchanges
by recording the asset acquired at the carrying value of the asset given up, the result will
be an asset reported at an amount greater than its fair value. This result would create a
misleading statement of financial position, so in this case, the asset acquired should be
reported at its fair value, even though there is no commercial substance. This will result
in a loss on the exchange.
Consider the following illustrations of asset exchanges.
Commercial Substance

9.3. Measurement at Recognition

357

ComLink Ltd. decides to change its manufacturing process in order to accommodate a
new product that will be introduced next year. They have decided to trade a factory
machine that is no longer used in their production for a new machine that will be used
to make the new product. The machine that is being disposed of had an original cost of
$78,000 and accumulated depreciation of $60,000. The fair value of the old machine
at the time of exchange was $22,000. The new machine being obtained has a list
price of $61,000. After a period of negotiation, the seller finally agreed to sell the new
machine to ComLink Ltd. for cash of $33,000 plus the trade-in of the old machine. As
the new machine will be used to manufacture a new product for the company, and the old
machine was essentially obsolete, we can reasonably conclude that this transaction has
commercial substance. In this case, the journal entry to record the exchange will be:

Note that the new machine is reported at the fair value of the assets given up in the
exchange ($33,000 cash + $22,000 machine). Also note that the gain on the disposal is
equal to the fair value of the old machine ($22,000) less the carrying value of the machine
at disposal ($78,000 − $60,000 = $18,000).
No Commercial Substance
Assume that ComLink Ltd. has a delivery truck that it purchased one year ago for $32,000.
Depreciation of $5,000 has been recorded to date on this asset. The company decides
to trade this for a new delivery truck in a different colour. The new truck has the same
functionality and expected life as the old truck. The only difference is the colour, which the
company feels ties in better with its corporate branding efforts. No identifiable cash flows
can be associated with the effect of this branding. The fair value of the old truck at the time
of the trade was $28,000. The seller of the new truck agrees to take the old truck in trade,
but requires ComLink Ltd. to pay an additional $5,000 in cash. In this instance, because
there is no discernible effect on future cash flows, we would reasonably conclude that
the transaction lacks commercial substance. The journal entry to record this transaction
would be:

Note that the new truck is reported at the book value of the assets given up ($5,000 cash+

($28,000 + $5,000 = $33,000) is not reported, and no gain on the transaction is realized.
If the same exchange occurred, but we were able to ascertain that the fair value of the
asset acquired was only $30,000, it would be inappropriate to record the new asset at a
value of $32,000, as this would exceed the fair value. The journal entry would thus be:

Note that the new truck is recorded at the lesser of its fair value and the book value of
the asset given up. This results in a loss on the transaction, even though the transaction
lacks commercial substance.

9.3.6 Deferred Payments
When a PPE asset is purchased through the use of long-term financing arrangements,
the asset should initially be recorded at the present value of the obligation. This technique
essentially removes the interest component from the ultimate payment, resulting in a
recorded amount that should be equivalent to the fair value of the asset. (Note, however,
that interest on self-constructed assets, covered in IAS 23 and discussed previously in
this chapter, is included in the cost of the asset.) Normally, the present value would be
discounted using the interest rate stated in the loan agreement. However, some contracts
may not state an interest rate or may use an unreasonably low interest rate. In these
cases, we need to estimate an interest rate that would be charged by arm’s length parties
in similar circumstances. This rate would be based on current market conditions, the
credit-worthiness of the customer, and other relevant factors.
Consider the following example. ComLink Ltd. purchases a new machine for its factory.
The supplier agrees to terms that allow ComLink Ltd. to pay for the asset in four annual
instalments of $7,500 each, to be paid at the end of each year. ComLink Ltd. issues a
$30,000, non-interest bearing note to the supplier. The market rate of interest for similar
arrangements between arm’s length parties is 8%. ComLink Ltd. will record the initial
purchase of the asset as follows:

The capitalized amount of $24,841 represents the present value of an ordinary annuity
of $7,500 for four years at an interest rate of 8%. The difference between the capitalized
amount and the total payments of $30,000 represents the amount of interest expense that
will be recognized over the term of the note.

9.3.7 Government Grants
Governments will at times create programs that provide direct assistance to businesses.
These programs may be designed to create employment in a certain geographic area,
to develop research and economic growth in a certain industry sector, or other reasons
that promote the policies of the government. When governments provide direct grants to
businesses, there are a number of accounting issues that need to be considered.
IAS 20 states that government grants should be “recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognizes as expenses the related
costs for which the grants are intended to compensate” (IAS 20-12, IAS, 1983). This
type of accounting is referred to as the income approach to government grants, and is
considered the appropriate treatment because the contribution is coming from an entity
other than the owner of the business.
If the grant is received in respect of current operating expenses, then the accounting
is quite straightforward. The grant would either be reported as other income on the
statement of profit or loss, or the grant would be offset against the expenses for which
the grant is intended to compensate. When the grant is received to assist in the purchase
of PPE assets, the accounting is slightly more complicated. In this case, the company
can defer the grant income, reporting it as a liability, and then recognize the income on a
systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Alternately, the company could simply
use the grant funds received to offset the initial cost of the asset. In this method, the grant
is implicitly recognized through the reduced depreciation charge over the life of the asset.
Consider the following example. ComLink Ltd. purchases a new factory machine for
$100,000. This machine will help the company manufacture a new, energy-saving product. The company receives a government grant of $20,000 to help offset the cost of the
machine. The machine is expected to have a five-year useful life with no residual value.
The accounting entries for this machine would look like this:

The net effect on income of either method is the same. The difference is only in the
presentation of the grant amount. Under the deferral method, the deferred grant amount
presented on the balance sheet as a liability would need to be segregated between current
and non-current portions.
Companies may choose either method to account for grant income. However, significant
note disclosures of the terms and accounting methods used for grants are required to
ensure comparability of financial statements.

9.4 Measurement After Initial Recognition
Once a PPE asset has been recognized and recorded, there are three choices in IFRS
of how to deal with the asset in subsequent accounting periods. The asset may be
accounted for using the cost model, the revaluation model, or the fair value model.
Each of these models treats subsequent changes in the value of the asset differently.
When a model is chosen, it must be applied consistently to all the assets in a particular
class.

9.4.1 Cost Model
The cost model is considered the more established or traditional method of accounting
for PPE assets. This model measures the asset after its acquisition at its cost, less any
accumulated depreciation or accumulated impairment losses. The model, thus, does not
attempt to adjust the asset to its current value, except in the case of impairment. This

9.4. Measurement After Initial Recognition

361

means that changes in the value of the asset are not recognized in income until that value
is actually realized through the sale of the asset. This model is widely used and is very
easy to understand and apply. Depreciation and impairment will be discussed in a later
chapter.

9.4.2 Revaluation Model
IFRS allows an alternative method for subsequent reporting of PPE assets. The revaluation model attempts to capture changes in an asset’s value over its life. An essential
condition of using this model is that the fair value of an asset be available and reliable at
the reporting date. Fair values can often be determined through the use of qualified
appraisers or other professionals who understand how to interpret market conditions.
If appraisals are not available, other valuation techniques may be used to estimate the
value. However, in some cases reliable fair values will not be available, so the model
cannot be used.
The standard does not require that revaluations be performed at each reporting date, but it
does require that the reported value not be materially different from the current fair value at
the reporting date. If the property, plant, and equipment asset is expected to have volatile
and significant changes in value, then annual revaluations are required. If the asset is
only subject to insignificant changes in fair value each year, then revaluations every three
to five years are recommended. The costs of obtaining valuation data or appraisals are
likely one reason this method is not used by many companies. There is an additional
cost in obtaining the reliable fair values, which many companies would compare to the
marginal benefit of adjusting the PPE amounts on the balance sheet. In many cases, the
fair values and depreciated costs of PPE assets would not be significantly different, so the
model would not be applied. For some types of assets such as real estate, however, the
revaluation model may provide significantly different results than the cost model. In these
instances, the use of the revaluation model has a stronger justification.
In applying the revaluation model, adjustments are made to the PPE asset value by
either adjusting the cost and accumulated depreciation proportionally, or by eliminating
the accumulated depreciation and adjusting the asset cost to the new value. The second
approach is simpler to apply, and will be used in the illustrations below.
When adjusting the value of the PPE asset, the obvious question is how to treat the
offsetting side of the journal entry. The answer is to use an account called Revaluation
Surplus, which is reported as part of other comprehensive income. However, there are
some complicating factors in using this account.
If the adjustment increases the reported value, then report as part of revaluation surplus.
If the adjustment decreases the reported value, then first reduce any existing revaluation
surplus for that asset to zero, and record the remaining reduction as an expense in profit

362

Property, Plant, and Equipment

or loss. This expense may be reversed in future periods, if the value once again rises.
Consider the following example to illustrate this model. ComLink Ltd. purchases a factory
building on January 1, 2014, for $500,000. The building is expected to have a useful life
of twenty years with no residual value. The company uses the revaluation model for this
class of asset and will obtain current valuations every two years. The journal entries for
the first two years would be:

The revaluation loss of $5,556 will be reported on the income statement in the current
year. In future years, if the value of the building increases again, a revaluation gain can
be reported on the income statement up to this amount. Any further increases will once
again increase the Revaluation Surplus account.
The Revaluation Surplus (OCI) account itself can be dealt with in two ways. It can simply
continue to be reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income for the life
of the asset. Once the asset is disposed of, the balance of the account is transferred from
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income directly to retained earnings. Another option
is to make an annual transfer from the revaluation surplus account to retained earnings.
The amount that can be transferred is limited to the difference between the depreciation
expense that is actually recorded (using the revalued carrying amount) and the amount
that would have been recorded had the cost model been used instead.

9.4.3 Fair Value Model
The fair value model is a specialized type of optional accounting treatment that may be
applied to only one type of asset: investment properties. IAS 40 (IAS, 2003b) considers
investment properties to be land or buildings that are held primarily for the purpose of
earning rental income or capital appreciation, are not used for production or administrative
purposes of the business, and are not held for resale in the ordinary course of business.
This definition suggests that the asset will earn cash flows that are largely independent
of the regular operations of the business, which is why a different accounting standard
can be applied. The fair value model requires adjustment of the carrying value of the
investment property to its fair value every reporting period. As well, no depreciation
is recorded for investment properties under the fair value model. The key feature that
differentiates this model from the revaluation model is that gains and losses in value with
investment properties are reported directly on the income statement, rather than using a
Revaluation Surplus (OCI) account. This can be illustrated with the following example.

364

Property, Plant, and Equipment

ComLink Ltd. purchases a vacant piece of land that it feels will appreciate in value over
the next ten years as a result of suburban expansion. The land is initially purchased for
$5 million on January 1, 2014. The company has classified this land as an investment
property and has chosen to use the fair value model. The appraised values of the land
over the next three years are:

It should be noted that this model is optional for reporting purposes. A company may
choose to use the cost model for its investment properties. However, if the fair value
model is chosen, all investment properties must be reported this way. As well, there are
significant disclosure requirements under this model.

9.5 Costs Incurred After Acquisition
Costs to operate and maintain a PPE asset are rarely ever captured completely by the
initial purchase price. After a PPE asset is acquired, it is quite likely that there will be additional costs incurred over time to maintain or improve the asset. The essential accounting
question that needs to be answered here is whether these costs should be recognized
immediately as an expense, or whether they should be capitalized and depreciated in
future periods. IAS 16 indicates that costs incurred in the day-to-day servicing of a PPE
asset should not be capitalized, as they do not meet the recognition criteria (i.e., they
do not provide future economic benefits). The types of costs discussed in the standard

9.5. Costs Incurred After Acquisition

365

include labour, consumables, and small parts. Immediately expensing these types of
costs recognizes the fact that normal repair and maintenance activities do not significantly
extend the useful life of an asset, nor do they improve the function of the asset. Rather,
they simply maintain the existing capacity. As such, they should be recognized as period
costs.
Sometimes, a major component of a PPE asset may require periodic replacement. For
example, the motor of a transport truck may need replacement after operating for a
certain number of hours. Or, a restaurant may choose to knock down its existing walls to
reconfigure and redecorate the space to create a fresher image. If the business managers
think these changes create the potential for future economic benefits, then capitalization
would be appropriate.
When these types of items are capitalized, they are actually replacing an existing component of a PPE asset. In these cases, the old component needs to be removed from
the carrying value of the asset before the new addition is capitalized. This procedure
is required, even if the part being replaced was not actually recorded as a separate
component. If this is the case, the standard allows for a reasonable estimate to be made
of the asset’s carrying value.
Consider the following example. LeCorre, a Michelin-starred restaurant, has recently
decided to update its image through a complete renovation of the dining room. This
process involved tearing out all the existing fixtures and relocating several walls. None of
the fixtures or walls were reported as separate components, as they were merely included
as part of the original building cost when it was purchased five years ago. The building
has been depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of thirty years.
The total cost of the renovation was $87,000, and the company received an additional
$2,000 from the sale of the old fixtures. It was also determined that construction costs in
this area have increased by approximately 30% over the last five years.
The journal entries to record this renovation will be separated into two parts: the disposal
of the old assets and the purchase of the new assets.

If we assume that the old fixtures and decorations are of a similar quality as the new
ones, then the construction cost of the new renovations can be used to estimate the
cost of the assets that have been removed. With an increase in construction costs of

366

Property, Plant, and Equipment

30% over five years, the original cost can be estimated to be $87,000 ×1÷(1+.3) =
$66,923. If the asset has been depreciated for five years, then the accumulated
depreciation would be ($66,923 ÷ 30) × 5 = $11,154. The loss on disposal equals
the difference between the calculated, net carrying value and the proceeds received.

If the management of LeCorre believes that these types of interior renovations will
continue in the future at similar intervals, it should record the cost as a separate
component, as the useful life would clearly differ from the building itself.

Note that if the original renovations had already been recorded as a separate component,
the journal entries would take the same form, but there would be no need to estimate the
cost and book value of the original assets, as they would be evident from the accounting
records.

9.6 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
IFRS
Component accounting is required. An
item of PPE is defined by the economic
benefits that are derived from it, not the
physical nature of the item.
Any revenue and expense incurred prior
to the PPE asset being ready to use is
taken to profit or loss, as this is considered
incidental to the construction of the asset.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to
PPE acquisition, construction, or development must be capitalized.
The cost of legal and constructive obligations for asset retirement must be capitalized.

ASPE
Significant and separable component
parts should be recorded as individual
assets where practicable. In practice,
this definition has led to less components
being reported under ASPE than IFRS.
Any revenue or expense from using an
item of PPE prior to its substantial completion is included in the asset’s cost.
Expenses are added to the asset cost
while revenues are deducted from the
asset cost.
Directly attributable Interest costs may be
capitalized if this is the company’s chosen
accounting policy.
Only legal obligations for asset retirement
need to be capitalized.

Chapter Summary

PPE items can be accounted for using the
cost or the revaluation models.
Investment properties can be accounted
for using the cost or fair value models.

IAS 16.19 (IAS, 2003a) prohibits the inclusion of general overhead costs in the
capital cost of a property, plant, and
equipment asset.
The general capitalization criterion requires the presence of future economic
benefits flowing to the entity. However,
IAS 16.20 (IAS, 2003a) prohibits the capitalization of redeployment, relocation, or
reorganization costs. This excludes the
capitalization of some of the items that
could be classified as betterments under
ASPE.

367

Only the cost model may be used for PPE.
No separate standard for investment properties. They fall under the same general
rule (i.e., the cost model) as other types of
PPE.
S 3061.08 allows directly attributable overhead costs to be included in the capital
cost of self-constructed property, plant,
and equipment assets.
S 3061.14 allows for the capitalization
of betterments. Betterments are costs
incurred to improve the service capacity,
extend the useful life, improve the quantity or quality of output, or reduce the
operating costs of a property, plant, and
equipment asset.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe the characteristics of property, plant, and equipment
assets that distinguish them from other assets.
PPE assets are tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods
and services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes. It is presumed that they
are expected to be used for more than one period. The distinguishing features are in their
nature (they are tangible) and in their use (production, rather than resale).

LO 2: Identify the criteria for recognizing property, plant, and
equipment assets.
PPE assets should be recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the entity and the item’s cost can be measured
reliably. As the definition of PPE does not identify what specific, physical element should
be measured, it is important for accountants to apply good judgment in identifying the
specific components of an asset that need to be reported separately.

368

Property, Plant, and Equipment

LO 3: Determine the costs to include in the measurement of
property, plant, and equipment at acquisition.
PPE costs should include any cost required to purchase the asset and bring it to its
intended location of use. As well, any further costs incurred to prepare the asset for its
intended use should also be capitalized.

LO 4: Determine the cost of a property, plant, and equipment asset
when the asset is acquired through a lump-sum purchase, a
deferred payment, or a non-monetary exchange.
When an asset is acquired through a lump-sum exchange, the purchase price should
be allocated based on the relative fair value of each asset acquired. When an asset is
acquired through a deferred payment, the asset cost should be recorded at the present
value of the future payments, discounted at either the interest rate implicit in the contract,
or at a reasonable market rate if the contract does not include a reasonable interest rate.
When a PPE asset is obtained through the issuance of the company’s own shares, the
asset should be recorded at its fair value. When a PPE asset is obtained by exchange with
another, non-monetary asset of the company, the new asset should be reported at the fair
value of the assets given up. However, if the fair values are not reliably measurable, or
if the transaction lacks commercial substance, then the new asset should be recorded
at the carrying value of the assets given up. The only exception to this occurs when a
transaction lacks commercial substance, but the fair value of the asset acquired is less
than the carrying value of the asset given up. In this case, the transaction should be
reported at the fair value of the asset acquired, in order to avoid overstating the value of
the new asset.

LO 5: Identify the effect of government grants in determining the
cost of a property, plant, and equipment asset.
IAS 20 says that, “Government grants [should be recognized] in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognizes as expenses the related costs
for which the grants are intended to compensate.” In the case of grants received to assist
in the purchase of PPE assets, the grant can either be deducted from the initial cost of the
asset, which will reduce future depreciation, or the grant can be deferred and amortized
into income on the same basis as the asset’s depreciation. The net effect on income of
these two methods will be exactly the same.

Chapter Summary

369

LO 6: Determine the cost of a self-constructed asset, including
treatment of related interest charges.
For self-constructed assets reported under IFRS, only direct costs, and not overheads,
should be allocated to the PPE asset. When borrowing is incurred to construct an asset
over a substantial amount of time, any interest that is directly attributable to the construction should be included in the asset cost.

LO 7: Identify the accounting treatment for asset retirement
obligation.
When the company has a legal or constructive obligation to dismantle, clean up, or restore
the asset site at the end of its useful life, the present value of those asset retirement costs
should be included in the capital cost of the asset.

LO 8: Apply the cost model.
Under this model, PPE assets are reported at their acquisition cost, less any accumulated
depreciation. No attempt is made to adjust the value to reflect current market conditions.

LO 9: Apply the revaluation model.
Under this model, PPE assets may be adjusted to their fair values on a periodic basis,
assuming the fair values are both available and reliable. Increases in value are credited
to the other comprehensive income account titled revaluation surplus. If the increase
reverses a previous decrease that was expensed, the increase should be reported as part
of profit or loss. Decreases in value are applied to first reduce any existing revaluation
surplus, and then reported as expense, if any balance remains. Adjustments to the asset
value can be made either by eliminating the accumulated depreciation and adjusting the
asset cost, or by adjusting the asset cost and accumulated depreciation proportionally.

LO 10: Apply the fair value model.
This model can only be used for investment properties, which are land and buildings held
primarily for the purpose of earning rental income or capital appreciation. With this model,
the carrying value of the investment property is adjusted to its fair value every reporting

370

Property, Plant, and Equipment

period. Any gains and losses resulting from the revaluation are reported directly in profit
or loss. As well, no depreciation is reported on investment properties under this model.

LO 11: Explain and apply the accounting treatment for
post-acquisition costs related to property, plant, and equipment
assets.
Costs incurred after acquisition can either be expensed immediately or added to the
carrying value of the PPE asset. Costs incurred for the normal, day-to-day maintenance of
PPE asset are usually expensed, as these costs do not add to the service life or capacity
of the asset. Costs that improve the asset by increasing future economic benefits, either
by extending the useful life or improving the efficiency of operation, are usually capitalized. When a significant component of the asset is replaced, the cost and accumulated
depreciation of the old asset should be removed and the cost of the new asset should be
capitalized.

LO 12: Identify key differences between IFRS and ASPE.
The concept of component accounting is not as explicitly articulated in ASPE. ASPE
requires revenues or expenses incurred prior to asset completion to be included in the
asset cost, whereas IFRS takes these items to profit or loss. IFRS requires capitalization
of borrowing costs, whereas ASPE leaves the choice to management. ASPE only requires capitalization of legal obligations for asset retirement, whereas IFRS also includes
constructive obligations as well. ASPE does not allow the use of the revaluation model or
the fair value model.

in one year. The market rate of interest for similar transactions is 9%.
Required: Prepare the journal entries for Lo-Dun Inc. to record the transactions. Provide
a rationale for the amount recorded for each item.

EXERCISE 9–6
Pei Properties recently purchased a vacant office condo where it plans to operate an
employment-training centre. The total purchase price of the condo was $625,000 with
an expected useful life of 30 years with no residual value. The local government in
this municipality was very interested in this project, providing a grant of $90,000 for the
purchase of the condo. The only condition of the grant was that the employment-training
centre be operated for a period of at least five years. Pei Properties believes that this
target can be achieved with the business plan it has prepared.
Required:

a. Prepare the journal entry to record the purchase of the condo, assuming the company uses the deferral method to record the government grant.
b. Repeat part (a) assuming the company uses the offset method to record the government grant.

EXERCISE 9–7
Finucane Manufacturing Inc. owns a large factory building that it purchased in 2011. At
the time of purchase, the company decided to apply the revaluation model to the property;
the first revaluation occurred on December 31, 2013. On January 1, 2014, the recorded
cost of the building was $1,200,000, and the accumulated depreciation was nil, as the
company applies the revaluation model by eliminating accumulated depreciation. The
balance in the revaluation surplus account on January 1, 2014, was $150,000. As well,
the company decided on this date to obtain annual appraisals of the property in order to
revalue it at every reporting period. The appraised values obtained over the next three
years were as follows:
Date
December 31, 2014
December 31, 2015
December 31, 2016

Appraised Value
$1,250,000
$1,000,000
$1,150,000

Required: Prepare all the required journal entries for this property for the years ended
December 31, 2014 to 2016. Assume that the building is depreciated on a straight-line
basis over 30 years with no residual value. Also assume that the company does not make
annual transfers from the revaluation surplus account to retained earnings.

EXERCISE 9–8
Kappi Capital Inc. holds a number of investment properties that it accounts for under IAS
40 using the fair value method. The company purchased a new rental property on January
1, 2015, for $1,500,000. The appraised value on December 31, 2015, was $1,450,000
and the appraised value on December 31, 2016, was $1,625,000.
Required: Prepare the adjusting journal entries for this property on December 31, 2015,
and December 31, 2016.

EXERCISE 9–9
Sun Systems Ltd. operates a manufacturing facility where specialized electronic components are assembled for use in consumer products. The facility was purchased in 2009
for a cost of $800,000, excluding the land component. At the time of purchase, it was
believed that the building would have a useful life of 40 years with no residual value.

The company follows the policy of recording a full year of depreciation in the year of an
asset’s acquisition and no depreciation in the year of an asset’s disposal. During 2015,
the following transactions with respect to the building occurred:

• Regular repairs to exterior stucco and mechanical systems were incurred at a total
cost of $32,000.
• In the middle of the year, the existing boiler system failed and required replacement.
The replacement cost of the new unit was $125,000. Management considers this to
be a major component of the building, but had not separately recorded the cost of
the original boiler, as it was included in the building purchase price. It is estimated
inflation has increased the cost of these types of units by 15% since 2009.
• The entire building was repainted at a cost of $15,000 during the year. This did not
extend the useful life of the building, but improved its overall appearance.
• A major structural repair to the foundation was undertaken during the year. This
repair cost $87,000 and was expected to extend the useful life of the building by ten
years over the original estimate.
• A small fire in the staff kitchen caused damage that cost $5,000 to repair.

Required: Prepare the journal entries to record the transactions that occurred in 2015.
Assume all transactions were settled in cash.

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of
Property, Plant, and Equipment

The Limping Kangaroo
The year 2014 was tough for Qantas Airways Ltd. On August 28, the iconic Australian
airline announced that it would be reporting a net loss of AUD $2,843 million for the
year ended June 30, 2014. The most significant components included in this loss were
two asset-impairment charges: AUD $387 million for impairment of specific assets
and AUD $2.6 billion for impairment of the Qantas International cash-generating unit.
The CEO, in his annual report to shareholders, indicated that these write-downs were
“required by accounting standards.” The chairman of the board of directors indicated
in his report that the year was “challenging” and “unsatisfactory” but made no mention
of the asset write-downs. These non-cash, asset-impairment charges, which were
charged primarily to the aircraft and engines category, clearly had a significant impact
on the company’s financial results. The impairment of the cash-generating unit, in
particular, was almost solely responsible for the company’s net loss.
This asset-impairment charge arose as part of a restructuring plan within the
business. The company assessed the value in use of a particular group of assets,
Qantas International, and determined that the current carrying value of these assets
was overstated. The value in use was determined by projecting future cash flows for
this asset group and then discounting these cash flows at a 10.5 percent interest rate.
In projecting the cash flows, assumptions were made about the growth rate of future
revenues, fuel charges, currency exchange rates, and many other factors.
The annual report explained that the impairment loss resulted from a situation where
wide-body aircraft were purchased at a time when the Australian dollar was weaker
than the US dollar. Although this may explain why the initial recorded value of these
assets was higher, it obscures reasons behind the current decline in the value in use.
Clearly, the economic benefits to be derived from these assets were no longer justified
by the initial purchase price. Companies purchase property, plant, and equipment
assets with the expectation of realizing economic benefits at least equal to the price
paid. Accounting standards need to be able to allocate these capital costs in a rational
way so that they are reflected in the accounting periods where the economic benefits
are created. When these estimates of benefit consumption are incorrect, write-downs
such as those experienced by Qantas are necessary. The CEO was correct in stating
that accounting standards require this treatment. (Qantas, 2014).
In this chapter, we will examine the details of the accounting treatment of the use and

Introduction
As we saw in the previous chapter, companies invest significant amounts of capital in
property, plant, and equipment (PPE) assets. The purpose of these investments is to
gain productive capacity that will further the goals of the business. The success of these
investments in PPE will be evaluated based on the productive capacity attained relative
to the costs incurred. We have already learned how to determine the costs to record for
PPE assets. In this chapter, we will examine how to record the use of PPE assets and
how to deal with the eventual disposal of these assets.

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

10.1 Definition
IAS 16.50 indicates that the depreciable amount of an asset should be allocated on a
systematic basis over its useful life. This description captures one of the key elements of
depreciation concept: it is an allocation of the asset’s cost.
Many people often associate the idea of depreciation with a decline in value of the asset.
Although it is possible that the depreciation calculated approximates the loss in value
of the asset as it is used, there is no guarantee that this will be true. It is important to
appreciate that the purpose of accounting depreciation is to match the initial cost of the
PPE asset to the periods that benefit from its use. Depreciation does not provide an
estimate of the change in an asset’s fair value. Rather, it simply provides a way to allocate
asset costs to the correct accounting periods.
The description above also identifies three key concepts:

• The depreciable amount
• The useful life of the asset
• The basis (method) used to calculate depreciation.

A further requirement of the standard is that significant components be depreciated separately. We will deal with each of these elements separately.

10.2 Depreciation Calculations
10.2.1 Depreciable Amount
The first element that needs to be determined for a depreciation calculation is the depreciable amount. It represents the cost that will be allocated to future periods through the
depreciation process. This amount is determined by taking the asset’s cost and deducting
the residual value. (Note: if the company uses the revaluation method, the cost is replaced
by the revalued amount in this calculation.) The residual value is the estimated net amount
that the company would be able to sell the asset for at the end of its useful life, based on
current conditions. Thus, the estimate does not try to anticipate future changes in market
or economic conditions; it merely considers the nature of the asset itself. The residual
value is, of course, an estimate and is thus subject to possible error. As a result, IFRS
requires an annual review of residual amounts used in depreciation calculations. If the

10.2. Depreciation Calculations

381

residual amount needs to be changed, it should be accounted for prospectively as a
change in estimate. Many assets will have a residual value of zero or close to zero, and
this amount will thus be ignored in the calculation. If the revised residual value were to
exceed the carrying value of the asset, then depreciation would cease until the residual
value dropped back below the carrying value.

10.2.2 Useful Life
The useful life of an asset is determined by its utility to the company. This means that
estimates need to be made about how long the company plans to use the asset. For
certain types of assets, companies may have a policy of timed replacement, even if the
asset is still functioning. This means the useful life may be less than the physical life of
the asset. IFRS (International Accounting Standards, n.d., 16.56) identifies the following
factors that need to be considered in determining useful life to the company:

• The expected usage of the asset, as assessed by reference to the asset’s expected
capacity or physical output.
• The expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors, such
as the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used, the repair and maintenance
program, and the care and maintenance of the asset while idle.
• The technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset arising from changes or
improvements in production or from a change in the market demand for the product
or service output of the asset. Expected future reductions in the selling price of an
item that was produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technical
or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of
the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
• The legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of related
leases.

It should be apparent that a substantial amount of judgment is required in determining
the useful life of an asset. Although management may have significant experience in
working with these assets, the estimation process can still result in errors. The process
of annual review and estimation changes for useful lives is the same as described above,
in 10.2.1: Depreciable Amount, for residual values.
Another question that needs to addressed when determining the useful life of an asset
is when to start and stop depreciating it. Depreciation of the asset should commence
when the asset is available for use. This means that the asset is in place and ready for
productive function, even if it is not actually being used yet. Depreciation should stop at

382

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

the earlier date when the asset is either reclassified as held for sale or derecognized.
These situations will be covered later in the chapter.

10.2.3 Methods of Calculation
The IFRS requirement of allocation of cost on a systematic basis is a deliberately vague
description of the techniques used to calculate depreciation. Companies are given the
freedom to choose the method used, as long as the method makes sense in relation to
the consumption of future economic benefits realized by use of the asset. The standard
does identify three broad techniques that can be used: straight line, diminishing balance,
and units of production. However, other techniques could be justified if they provide a
more systematic and reasonable allocation of cost. The standard also indicates that
depreciation methods based on revenue should not be used, as revenue may be affected
by factors, such as inflation, that are not directly related to the consumption of economic
benefits.
Straight-Line Method
This is the simplest and most commonly used depreciation method. This method simply
allocates cost in equal proportions to the time periods of an asset’s useful life. The formula
to determine the depreciation charge is as follows:
Cost − Residual value
= Depreciation charge
Useful life
For example, consider an automated packaging machine purchased for $100,000 that is
used in a factory. It is estimated that this machine will have a useful life of ten years and
will have a residual value of $5,000. The calculation of the annual depreciation charge is
as follows:
$100,000 − $5,000
= $9,500 per year
10 years
The benefit of this method is its simplicity for both the preparer and reader of the financial
statement. No special knowledge is required to understand the logic of the calculation.
As well, the method is appropriate if we assume that economic benefits are delivered in
roughly equal proportions over the life of the asset. However, there are arguments that
are contrary to this assumption. For certain assets, it may be reasonable to assume that
the economic benefits decline with the age of the asset, as there is more downtime due to
repairs or other operational inefficiencies that result from age. If these inefficiencies are
significant, then the straight-line method may not be the most appropriate method.

10.2. Depreciation Calculations

383

Diminishing-Balance Method
The diminishing-balance method results in more depreciation in the early years of an
asset’s life and less depreciation in later years. The justification for this method is that
an asset will offer its greatest service potential when it is relatively new. Once an asset
ages and starts to require more repairs, it will be less productive to the business. This
reasoning is quite consistent with the experience many companies have with assets that
have mechanical components. This method will also result in an overall expense to the
company that is fairly consistent over the life of the asset. In early years, depreciation
charges are high, but repairs are low; in later years, this situation will reverse.
A number of different calculations can be used when applying the diminishing-balance
method. The common feature of all the methods is that a constant percentage is applied
to the closing net book value of the asset each year to determine the depreciation charge.
The percentage that is used can be derived in a number of ways. The most accurate
way would be to apply a formula to determine the exact percentage needed to depreciate
the asset down to its residual value. Although this can be done, this approach is not
often used, because it requires a more complex calculation. A simpler, more commonly
used approach is to simply use a multiple based on the asset’s useful life. For example,
a technique referred to as double-declining balance would convert the useful life to a
percentage and multiply the result by two. In our previous example, the calculation would
be as follows:
1
× 2 = Depreciation rate
Useful life
1
× 2 = 20%
10 years

*Note: In the final year, depreciation does not equal the calculated amount of net book
value multiplied by depreciation percentage ($13,422 × 20% = $2,684). In the final
year, the asset needs to be depreciated down to its residual value. The double-declining
balance method will not result in precisely the right amount of depreciation being taken
over the asset’s useful life. This means that the final year’s depreciation will need to be
adjusted to bring the net book value to the residual value. Depending on the useful life
of the asset, this final-year depreciation amount may by higher or lower than the amount
calculated by simply applying the percentage. Because depreciation is an estimate based
on a number of assumptions, this type of adjustment in the final year is considered
appropriate.
Also note that in the calculations above, unlike other methods, the residual value is not
deducted when determining the depreciation expense each year. The residual value is
considered only when adjusting the final year’s depreciation expense.
Units-of-Production Method
This method is the most theoretically supportable method for certain types of assets.
The method charges depreciation on the basis of some measure of activity related to the
asset. The measures are often output based, such as units produced. They can also be
input based, such as machine hours used. Although output-based measures are the most
accurate way to reflect the consumption of economic benefits, input-based measures are
also commonly used. The benefit of this method is that it clearly links the actual usage
of the asset to the expense being charged, rather than simply reflect the passage of time.
Returning to our example, if the machine were expected to be able to package 1,000,000
boxes before requiring replacement, our depreciation rate would be calculated as follows:
$100,000 − $5,000
= $0.095 per box
1,000,000 boxes
Thus, if in a given year, the machine actually processed 102,000 boxes, the depreciation
charge for that year would be as follows:

102,000 × $0.095 = $9,690
In years of high production, depreciation will increase; in years of low production, depreciation will decrease. This is a reasonable result, as the costs are being matched to the
benefits being generated. However, this method is appropriate only where measures of
usage are meaningful. In some cases, assets cannot be easily measured by their use. An
office building that houses the corporate headquarters cannot be easily defined in terms
of productive capacity. For this type of asset, a time-based measure would make more
sense.

10.2. Depreciation Calculations

385

10.2.4 Separate Components
As noted in Chapter 9, IFRS requires PPE assets be segregated into significant components. One of the reasons for doing this is that a significant component of the asset may
have a different useful life than other parts of the asset. An airplane’s engine does not
have the same useful life as the fuselage. It makes sense to segregate these components
and charge depreciation separately, as this will provide a more accurate picture of the
consumption of economic benefits from the use of the asset.
The process of determining what comprises a component requires some judgment from
managers. A reasonable approach would be to first determine what constitutes a significant component of the whole and then determine which components have similar characteristics and patterns of use. Practical considerations, the availability of information,
and cost versus benefit analyses (related to accounting costs) may all be relevant in
determining how finely the components are defined. The goal is to create information
that is meaningful for decision-making purposes without being overly burdensome to the
company.

10.2.5 Partial Period Calculations
In the year of acquisition or disposal of a PPE asset, an additional calculation complication
arises—namely, how to deal with depreciation for only part of a year. If the units-ofproduction method is being used, this isn’t really a problem, as the depreciation will be
based on the actual production in the partial period. However, for time-based methods,
like straight line or diminishing balance, an adjustment to the calculation will be required.
Because accounting standards do not specify how to deal with this problem, companies
have adopted a number of different practices. Although depreciation could be prorated
on a daily basis, it is more usual to see companies prorate the calculation based on the
nearest whole month that the asset was being used in the accounting period. Some
companies will charge a full year of depreciation in the year of acquisition and none in
the year of disposal, while other companies will reverse this pattern. Some companies
charge half the normal rate in the years of acquisition and disposal. Whatever method is
used, the total amount of depreciation charged over the life of the asset will be the same.
As long as the method is applied consistently, there shouldn’t be material differences in
the reported results.

386

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

10.2.6 Revision of Depreciation
As noted previously, many elements of the depreciation calculation are based on estimates. IFRS requires that these estimates be reviewed on an annual basis for their
reasonableness. If it turns out that the original estimate is no longer appropriate, how
should the depreciation calculation be revised? The treatment of estimate changes requires prospective adjustment, which means that current and future periods are adjusted
for the effect of the change. No adjustments should be made to depreciation amounts
reported in prior periods. The reasoning behind this treatment is that estimates, by their
nature, are subject to inaccuracies. As well, conditions may change; the asset may be
used in a different fashion than originally intended, or the asset may lose function quicker
or slower than originally anticipated. As long as the original estimate was reasonable in
relation to the information available at the time, there is no need to adjust prior periods
once conditions change.
Consider our original example of straight-line depreciation. The initial calculation resulted
in an annual depreciation charge of $9,500. After two years of use, the company’s
management noticed that the asset’s condition was deteriorating quicker than expected.
The useful life of the asset was revised to seven years, and the residual value was reduced
to $2,000. The revision to the depreciation charge would be calculated as follows:
Remaining book value − Revised residual value
Remaining useful life
Thus, the calculation would be as follows:
$100,000 − ($9,500 × 2) − $2,000
= $15,800 per year
7 − 2 = 5 years remaining
The company would begin charging this amount in the third year and would not revise the
previous depreciation that was recorded. This technique is also applied if the company
changes its method of depreciation, because it believes the new method better reflects
the pattern of use or benefits derived from the asset, or if improvements are made to the
asset that add to its capital cost.

10.3 Impairment
For a variety of reasons, a PPE asset may sometimes become fully or partially obsolete
to the business. If the value of the asset declines below its carrying value, the accounting

10.3. Impairment

387

question is whether this decline in value should be recorded or not. For current assets
such as inventory, these types of declines in value are recorded so that a financialstatement reader is not misled into thinking the current asset will generate more cash
than is actually realizable. This treatment is reasonable for a current asset, but should the
same approach be used for PPE assets?
Impairment of PPE asset values can result from many different circumstances. IAS 36
discusses the following possible signs of impairment:
External indicators
• include observable indications of decline in value;
• include technological, market, economic, or legal changes that affect the asset or
entity;
• include increases in interest rates that reduce the discounted value in use of the
asset; and
• mean that the carrying value of the entity’s net assets is greater than its market
capitalization.
Internal indicators
• include obsolescence or physical damage;
• include significant changes in how the asset is used, such as excess capacity or
plans for early disposal of the asset; and
• mean that economic performance of asset is worse than expected, including the
cash needed to acquire and/or operate and maintain the asset.
These factors and other information will need to be considered carefully when reviewing
for impairment; judgment will need to be applied. The company should assess whether
there is any indication of asset impairment on an annual basis. If there is evidence of
impairment, then the company will need to determine the amount of the impairment and
account for this condition.

10.3.1 Accounting for Impairment
There is an assumption in the IFRS standards that an entity will act in a rational manner.
This means that if selling the asset rather using it can generate more economic benefit, it

388

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

would make sense to do so. To determine impairment, we need to compare the carrying
value of the asset with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is defined as the greater of the asset’s value in use
and its fair value, less costs of disposal. The asset’s value in use is calculated as the
present value of all future cash flows related to the asset, assuming that it continues to be
used. The fair value less costs of disposal refers to the actual net amount that the asset
could be sold for based on current market conditions.
Consider the following example. During the annual review of asset impairment conditions,
a company’s management team decides that there is evidence of impairment of a particular asset. This asset is recorded on the books with a cost of $30,000 and accumulated
depreciation of $10,000. Management estimates and discounts future cash flows related
to the asset and determines the value in use to be $15,000. The company also seeks
the advice of an equipment appraiser who indicates that the asset would likely sell at an
auction for $14,000, less a 10 percent commission.
The recoverable amount of the asset is $15,000, as this value in use is greater than the
fair value less costs of disposal ($14,000 − $1,400 = $12,600). The carrying value is
$20,000 ($30,000 − $10,000). As the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value,
the asset is impaired. The following journal entry must be recorded to account for this
condition:
Date

General Journal
Account/Explanation
Loss on impairment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Accumulated impairment loss . . . . . . . . . . . .

PR

Debit
5,000

Credit
5,000

Although a separate accumulated impairment loss account has been credited here, it is
common in practice to simply credit accumulated depreciation. The net result of these two
approaches will be exactly the same. Also note that if the asset were accounted for using
the revaluation method, the impairment loss would first reduce any existing revaluation
surplus (OCI), with the remaining loss being charged to the income statement.
If, in the future, the recoverable amount increases so that the asset is no longer impaired,
the accumulated impairment loss can be reversed. However, the impairment loss can be
reversed only to the extent that the new carrying value does not exceed the depreciated
carrying value that would have existed had the impairment never occurred. Also note
that in subsequent years, depreciation calculations will be based on the revised carrying
value.
A different method is used to determine impairment under ASPE. This method is described in 10.7 Appendix A.

10.3. Impairment

389

10.3.2 Cash-Generating Units
The usual situation when applying an impairment test would be to make the assessments
on an asset-by-asset basis. However, in some circumstances, it may be impossible to
determine the impairment of an individual asset. Some assets may have a value in use
only when used in combination with other assets. Consider, for example, a petrochemicalprocessing plant. The plant is engineered with many customized components that work
together to process and produce a final product. If any part of the plant were removed,
the process could not be completed. In this case, the cash flows derived from the use
of the group of assets are considered a single economic event. The cash flows from
an individual asset component within the group cannot be determined separately. In
these cases, IAS 36 allows the impairment test to be performed at the level of the cashgenerating unit, rather than at the individual asset level.
IAS 36 defines a cash-generating unit as “the smallest identifiable group of assets that
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets
or groups of assets” (International Accounting Standards, n.d., 36.68). The definition
of cash-generating units should be applied consistently from year to year. Obviously,
significant judgment is required in making these determinations.
The impairment test is applied the same way to cash-generating units as with individual
assets. The only difference is that any resulting impairment loss is allocated on a prorata basis to the individual assets within the cash-generating unit, based on the relative
carrying amounts of those assets within the group. However, in this process, no individual
asset should be reduced below the greater of its recoverable amount or zero.
Consider the following example. A petrochemical-processing plant is composed of a
number of different assets, including the following:
Cost ($)
Pumps, tanks, and drums
Reactors
Pipes and fittings
Distillation column

390,000
1,100,000
275,000
850,000

Carrying
Amount ($)
180,000
450,000
120,000
385,000
1,135,000

Management considers this plant to be a cash-generating unit. Due to recent declines in
commodity prices, management believes the plant may be impaired. After some investigation, management determines that the distillation column could be sold for net proceeds
of $435,000. All the other assets, however, are integrated into the plant structure and
could not be sold separately. As well, due to local regulations, the plant cannot be sold
in its entirety. Management has projected that by operating the plant for the next three

390

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

years, cash flows of $1,200,000 could be generated. The present value of these cash
flows is $950,000.
Impairment here is determined by comparing the carrying amount of $1,135,000 with the
recoverable amount of $950,000. The value in use is the appropriate measure here, as
the fair value less costs to sell of $435,000 is lower. In this case, there is an impairment
of $185,000 ($1,135,000 − $950,000). None of the impairment should be allocated to the
distillation column, as the carrying value of $385,000 is already less than the recoverable
amount of $435,000. For the remaining components, we cannot determine the recoverable amount, so the impairment loss will be allocated to these assets on a pro-rata basis.

10.4 Derecognition
At some point in a PPE asset’s life, it will be sold, disposed, abandoned, or otherwise
removed from use. The accounting treatment for these events will depend on the timing
and nature of the transactions.

10.4.1 Held for Sale
When management first makes the decision to sell a noncurrent asset rather than continue to use it in operations, it should be reclassified as an asset that is held for sale.
This is a class of current assets that is disclosed separately from other assets. For an
asset to be classified as held for sale, the following conditions must be met:

• The asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only
to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets.
• The sale must be highly probable.

10.4. Derecognition

391

• Management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset.
• There must be the initiation of an active program to locate a buyer and complete the
plan.
• The asking price must be reasonable in relation to the asset’s current fair value.
• The sale should be expected within one year of the decision, unless circumstances
beyond the entity’s control delay the sale.
• It is unlikely that the plan will be withdrawn.
There are a number of accounting issues with held-for-sale assets. First, the asset needs
to be revalued to the lower of its carrying value, or its fair value, less costs to sell. Because
the company expects to sell these assets in a short period of time, it is reasonable to
report them at an amount that is no greater than the amount of cash that can be realized
from their sale. Second, assets that are held for sale are no longer depreciated. This is
reasonable, as these assets by definition are available for immediate sale. This means
that they are no longer being used for productive purposes, so depreciating them would
not be appropriate.
The result of the revaluation described above means that an impairment loss will occur if
the expected proceeds (fair value less costs to sell) are less than the carrying value. This
loss will be reported in the year that management makes the decision to sell the asset,
even if the asset is not actually sold by the year-end. The impairment loss will be reported
in a manner consistent with other impairment losses, as described in IAS 36. When
the asset is actually sold, the difference between the actual proceeds and the amount
expected will be treated as a gain or loss in that year, not as an increase or reversal of the
previous impairment loss.
If, at the time of classification as held for sale, the expected proceeds are greater than the
carrying amount, this gain will not be reported until the asset is actually sold. This gain
will simply be reported as a gain consistent with the treatment of other gains.
Consider this example. A company purchases an asset for $100,000 in 2010 and decides
in late 2015 to sell the asset immediately. The accumulated depreciation at the time
the decision is made is $40,000. Management estimates that the asset can be sold for
$50,000, less disposal costs of $2,000. In 2015, when the decision to sell the asset is
made, the following journal entry will be required.

As a practical matter, many companies may not immediately reclassify the asset as held
for sale, as they expect to sell it within the same accounting period, or they do not meet
the strict criteria for classification. If this occurs, then the disposal journal entry will simply
remove the carrying value of the asset, report the net proceeds received, and report a
gain or loss on disposal. This gain or loss will be reported on the income statement, but
gains cannot be classified as revenues.

10.4.2 Other Derecognition Issues
There are times when assets may be disposed of in ways other than by direct sale. For
example, an asset can be expropriated by a government agency that has the authority to
do so, with compensation being paid. Insurance proceeds may be received for an asset
destroyed in a fire. These types of transactions would be recorded much as a simple sale
would be, with a resulting gain or loss (the difference between the compensation received
and the carrying value of the assets) being reported on the income statement.

10.5. Presentation and Disclosure Requirements

393

In other instances, a company may choose to simply abandon or scrap an asset for no
proceeds. If this occurs, the asset should be derecognized, and a loss equal to the
carrying value of the asset at the time of abandonment should be recognized.
A less common situation may occur when a business agrees to donate an asset to some
other entity. For example, a land-development company may donate a piece of land to a
municipality for use as a recreational space. The company may believe that this will help
develop a positive business relationship with the municipality and its citizens. With this
type of transaction, the fair value of the property needs to be determined. The disposal
will then be recorded at this value, which will result in expense being recorded equal to
this fair value. The carrying value of the asset will also be derecognized, which will result
in a gain or loss if the carrying value differs from the fair value.

10.5 Presentation and Disclosure Requirements
IAS 16 details a number of required disclosures for property, plant, and equipment assets.
Some of these disclosures are as follows:

• The measurement bases used
• Depreciation methods used
• Useful life or depreciation rates used
• A reconciliation of the gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation at the
beginning of the period to the amount at the end of the period, including
– details of revaluations and impairment losses, including an indication of whether
an independent appraiser was used;
– details of additions and disposals, including assets held for sale;
– the depreciation charged during the year; and
– the effect on PPE of exchange rate differences
• Restrictions on the use of the assets pledged as security for liabilities
• Commitments to purchase assets
• Any compensation received from third parties when assets are impaired or abandoned
• Details of the effects of changes in estimates.

394

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

The scope and scale of these disclosure requirements reflect the fact that property, plant,
and equipment assets are often a significant portion of a company’s total asset base. As
well, they reflect the variety of different methods and estimates required in accounting
for PPE assets. The significant disclosures should help readers better understand how a
company uses its assets to generate returns.

10.6 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
IFRS
The depreciable amount is calculated using the asset’s residual value.

The term used is depreciation.
Cost, revaluation, and fair-value models
can be used.
Assessment for indications of impairment
should occur at least annually.
A one-step process to determine impairment, based on comparing recoverable
amount with carrying amount, is used.
Recoverable amount is the greater of
value in use or fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment loss can be reversed when
estimates change. However, amount of
reversal may be limited.
Assets that meet the criteria of held for
sale are classified as current.
More extensive disclosure requirements
must be met.

ASPE
The depreciable amount is calculated using the lesser of salvage value or residual
value. Salvage value is the estimated
value of the asset at the end of its physical
life, rather than its useful life.
The term used is amortization.
Only the cost model is allowed.
Impairment is tested only when circumstances indicate impairment may exist.
A two-step process is used. Impairment
is tested first by comparing carrying value
with undiscounted cash flows. If impaired,
the loss is determined by subtracting the
fair value from the carrying amount. See
10.7 Appendix A for details.
Impairment loss cannot be reversed.

Assets held for sale can be classified as
current only if the asset is sold before
financial statements are completed.
Fewer disclosure requirements must be
met.

10.7 Appendix A: ASPE Standards for Impairment
Under ASPE 3063, a different set of standards is applied to the issue of PPE impairment. The basic premise underlying these principles is that an asset is impaired if its
carrying value cannot be recovered. Unlike IFRS, which requires annual impairment

10.7. Appendix A: ASPE Standards for Impairment

395

testing, the ASPE standard requires only impairment testing when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that impairment may be present. Some of the possible indicators
of an asset’s impairment include the following:
• A significant decrease in its market price
• A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which it is being used or in
its physical condition
• A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could
affect its value, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator
• An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected
for its acquisition or construction
• A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating
or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses
associated with its use
• A current expectation that, more likely than not, it will be sold or otherwise disposed
of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life (“more likely than
not” means a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent) (CPA Canada, 2016,
3063.10).
The accountant will need to apply judgment in assessing these criteria. Other factors
could be present that could indicate impairment.
Once the determination is made that impairment may be present, the accountant must
follow a two-step process:
1. Determine if the asset is, in fact, impaired.
2. Calculate and record the impairment loss.
Step 1 involves the application of a recoverability test. This test is applied by comparing
the predicted, undiscounted future cash flows from the asset’s use and ultimate disposal
with the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less
than the asset’s carrying value, the asset is impaired. The calculation of the predicted,
undiscounted cash flows will be based primarily on the company’s own assessment of
the possible uses of the asset. However, the accountant will need to apply diligence in
assessing the reasonableness of these cash flow assumptions.
Step 2 involves a different calculation to then determine the impairment loss. The impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value. The fair

396

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

value is defined as “the amount of the consideration that would be agreed upon in an arm’s
length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties who are under no compulsion
to act” (CPA Canada, 2016 3063.03b). Note that, unlike the IFRS calculation, disposal
costs are not considered. The fair value should always be less than the undiscounted cash
flows, as any knowledgeable party would discount the cash flows when determining an
appropriate value. The best evidence of fair value would be obtained from transactions
conducted in active markets. However, for some types of assets, active market data
may not be available. In these cases, other techniques and evidence will be required to
determine the fair value.
The application of this standard can be best illustrated with an example. Consider a
company that believes a particular asset may be impaired, based on its current physical
condition. Management has estimated the future undiscounted cash flows from the use
and eventual sale of this asset to be $125,000. Recent market sales of similar assets
have indicated a fair value of $90,000. The asset is carried on the books at a cost of
$200,000 less accumulated depreciation of $85,000. In applying step 1, the recoverability
test, management will compare the undiscounted cash flows ($125,000) with the carrying
value ($115,000). In this case, because the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying
value, no impairment is present, and no further action is required.
If, however, the future, undiscounted cash flows were $110,000 instead of $125,000, the
result would be different:
Step 1:

Future undiscounted cash flows
Carrying value
Difference

$110,000
$115,000
$ (5,000)

Because this result is less than zero, the asset is impaired. The impairment loss must
then be calculated.
Step 2: Fair value
Carrying value
Impairment loss

Although a separate accumulated impairment loss account has been credited here, it is

Chapter Summary

397

common in practice to simply credit accumulated depreciation. The net result of these
two approaches will be the same.
The new carrying value for the asset after the impairment loss is recorded becomes the
new cost base for the asset. This result has two effects. First, the asset’s depreciation rate
will need to be recalculated to take into account the new cost base and any other changes
that may be relevant. Second, any subsequent change in circumstances that results in
the asset no longer being impaired cannot be recorded. Future impairment reversals are
not allowed, because we are creating a new cost base for the asset.
One conceptual problem with this approach is that the carrying value of the asset may
not always reflect the underlying economic value to the company. By not testing for
impairment every year, it is possible that an asset that is becoming impaired incrementally
may not be properly adjusted until the impairment is quite severe. Once the impairment is
recorded, the inability to reverse this amount if future circumstances improve means the
asset’s economic potential is not properly reflected on the balance sheet. Although there
are problems with this approach, it can be argued that annual impairment testing for all
assets is a time-consuming and costly exercise. Thus, the standard results in a trade-off
between theoretical and practical considerations. This is considered a reasonable tradeoff for private enterprises, as they usually have a much smaller group of potential financialstatement readers, as well as fewer resources available to dedicate to accounting and
reporting matters.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Identify the purpose of depreciation, and discuss the elements
that are required to calculate depreciation.
Depreciation is a systematic allocation of an asset’s cost to the accounting periods in
which the benefits of the asset are consumed. Depreciation is not an attempt to revalue
the asset. To calculate depreciation, one needs to determine the depreciable amount, the
useful life, and method of calculation. The depreciable amount is the cost less the residual
value. The useful life of an asset will not necessarily be the same as the physical life of the
asset. The method should systematically allocate the cost in a manner that reflects the
consumption of economic benefits. Significant judgment will be required when applying
these three elements.

398

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

LO 2: Calculate depreciation using straight-line,
diminishing-balance, and units-of-production methods.
Straight-line depreciation assumes that benefits are derived from the asset in equal proportions over the asset’s life. The calculation divides the depreciable amount by the useful
life and then allocates this equal charge over the life of the asset. The diminishingbalance approach assumes that greater benefits are derived earlier in an asset’s life.
This approach charges a constant percentage of the asset’s carrying value each year to
depreciation. The units-of-production method charges varying amounts of depreciation
based on the asset’s activity. Using output measures is more theoretically correct, but input measures may also be used. The calculation requires dividing the depreciable amount
by the expected amount of productive output over the asset’s life and then applying the
resulting rate to the actual production in the reporting period.

LO 3: Discuss the reasons for separate component accounting and
the accounting problems that may arise from this approach.
Component accounting is required because significant asset components may have different useful lives and different economic consumption patterns. By recording components
separately, accountants are able to create more meaningful depreciation calculations.
Problems that arise in this approach include the inability to measure component costs
accurately, the judgment required in identifying significant components, and the additional
accounting costs in maintaining component records.

LO 4: Calculate depreciation when partial periods or changes in
estimates are required.
The depreciation charge in the period in which an asset is purchased or sold will need
to be prorated based on time, except when using the units-of-production method. This
proration can be calculated a number of ways but should be consistent from period to
period. When changes in estimates regarding useful life, residual value, or pattern of
consumption (method) are determined, these changes should be treated prospectively.
The new estimate is applied to the current carrying amount, resulting a new depreciation charge for current and future periods. No adjustments are made to past perioddepreciation charges.

Chapter Summary

399

LO 5: Discuss indicators of impairment and calculate the amount of
impairment.
Impairment is indicated when external factors related to the environment in which the
business operates or internal factors related to the asset itself indicate that the carrying
value may not be ultimately realized. External factors include observable indications of
loss of value; technological, market, or legal changes; increases in interest rates; and
declines in market capitalization. Internal factors include physical damage, changes in
the use of the asset, and declining productivity of the asset. Impairment is calculated as
the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the greater of the value in use or fair value, less costs of disposal. Impairment
tests may sometimes be applied to cash-generating units if the effects on individual assets
cannot be determined.

LO 6: Identify the criteria required to classify an asset as held for
sale.
For an asset to be classified as held for sale, a number of conditions must be present.
The asset must be available for immediate sale, and the sale must be highly probable.
Management must be committed to the sale and must have an active program to locate a
buyer. The asking price must be reasonable in relation to the market. The sale should be
expected within one year, and it should be unlikely that the plan will be withdrawn.

LO 7: Prepare journal entries for assets held for sale.
When an asset is classified as held for sale, it must be revalued to the lower of its carrying
value or fair value less costs to sell. As well, depreciation of the asset will cease once it is
classified as held for sale. This treatment means that either no change in value will occur,
or an impairment loss will be reported in the year when the classification occurs. When
the asset is subsequently sold in a future period, the resulting gain or loss is not treated
as an impairment loss or reversal.

LO 8: Discuss other derecognition issues.
If an asset is expropriated or otherwise disposed, and proceeds are received, this transaction is treated the same as any other asset disposal, with the resulting gain or loss being
reported on the income statement. If an asset is simply abandoned or scrapped, then
that asset needs to be derecognized, and a loss will be reported equal to the carrying

400

Depreciation, Impairment, and Derecognition of Property, Plant, and Equipment

value of the asset. When an asset is donated, the asset needs to be derecognized, and
an expense is recognized equal to the fair value of the asset. This means a gain or loss
will likely result on this transaction.

LO 9 Identify the presentation and disclosure requirements for
property, plant, and equipment.
IFRS requires a significant amount of disclosure regarding PPE assets. Some of these
disclosures include details of methods and assumptions that are used in depreciation
calculations, the measurement base used, reconciliation of changes during the period,
restrictions on and commitments for assets, details of any revaluations, details of changes
in estimates, and other factors.

LO 10: Identify key differences between IFRS and ASPE.
IFRS and ASPE share many similarities in the treatment of PPE assets. Some differences
include the absence of fair value and revaluation methods under ASPE, a different test
and criteria for impairment, different classification rules for held-for-sale assets, different
methods of determining the depreciable amount, and greater disclosure requirements
under IFRS.

Michaux Ltd. purchased an office building on January 1, 2001, for $450,000. At that time,
it was estimated that the building would last for 30 years and would have a residual value
of $90,000. Early in 2007, a significant modification was made to the roof of the building
at a cost of $30,000. This modification could not be identified as a separate component,
but it was believed that it would add an additional ten years to the useful life. As well, it
was estimated the residual value would be reduced to $50,000 at the end of the revised
useful life. In 2015, due to a collapse in the local property market, the residual value was
revised to nil. The useful life, however, was expected to remain as estimated in 2007. The
company uses the straight-line method of depreciation.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Tesla Patents to be Shared With Competitors
In an unprecedented move, Tesla announced in 2014 that it intended to share its
significant number of patents with all other companies making electric cars. This is a
radical departure from its previous strategy to apply for as many patents as possible
considering its concern that the big car companies would copy Tesla’s technology.
Tesla would be no match for these companies with their huge scale manufacturing
facilities and their big budget sales and marketing. As it turned out, Tesla’s fears
about the big car companies copying Tesla’s technology did not materialize because
the electric vehicle market was not big enough to make the effort.
Since then, a new movement called “open source” has been gaining prominence in
today’s business world. Since the focus of Tesla Motors was to accelerate the growth
of sustainable transport—including electric cars—it follows that they would change
their philosophy from holding patents to sharing their technology with other electric
car companies. Moreover, the global vehicle market has now reached about two
billion cars, increasing the carbon crises concern held by many. This environmental
concern creates an opportunity for the electric car industry sector to take a bigger slice
of the car market, especially if like-minded companies such as Tesla band together
and share their technologies. This could result in the development of a common
technology platform that would further the sustainable transport sector as a better
environmental alternative compared to hydrocarbon-based transportation, currently
the focus of most big car companies.

Introduction
Why did Tesla purposely share its valuable and closely guarded patent secrets with
its competitor electric car manufacturers? As the covering story explains, their largest
competition does not come from within their own electric vehicle industry sector—it comes
from the massive hydrocarbon-operated (i.e., gasoline, diesel) car market. If Tesla shares
its critical intellectual property, such as its patents, with other electric car manufacturers
at no cost, the electric car industry sector could strengthen enough to cause a shift in
consumers from hydrocarbon vehicles to electric. In short, it is all about increasing the
market share for electric cars. By sharing these valuable intangible assets within their
industry sector, it increases these odds significantly.
Tesla thinks they can use their patents, which are some of Tesla’s intangible assets, to
make a difference and create a shift in demand from hydrocarbon to electric-powered
vehicles. This must mean that there is a tremendous value regarding Tesla’s patents.
As intangibles assets, how might Tesla account for these patents? This chapter look at
intangible assets and goodwill and how they impact business.

Chapter Organization
Like property, plant, and equipment (PPE) assets, intangible assets are long-lived, nonmonetary assets whose costs are capitalized and reported as long-term assets on the
statement of financial position/balance sheet (SFP/BS). But unlike PPE, intangible assets
have no physical presence. Patents and copyrights have often become the subject of

11.1. Intangible Assets and Goodwill: Overview

409

news headlines when competitor companies attempt to infringe upon them. Many costly
and prolonged court battles have occurred as a result. Significant value is associated
with these intangible assets, so it is critical that they be accounted for as realistically as
possible.
This chapter will focus on the various kinds of intangible assets and goodwill in terms of
their use in business, as well as their recognition, measurement, reporting, and analysis.

11.1 Intangible Assets and Goodwill: Overview
Consider how important video game developers such as BioWare, the creators of Dragon
Age, have become in this decade with their mass-market appeal for gaming software.
Their major long-term assets are not physical assets as is the case with other companies
that own mainly property, plant, and equipment. Instead, their assets are the software and

410

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

the unique software development teams who are inspired and talented enough to create
gaming products that are successfully marketed to millions of people around the world.
Software gaming programs are copyrighted, just like published books. The copyright may
have no physical presence but it has value, as will now be discussed.
In terms of accounting for intangible assets, IFRS, IAS 38 Intangible Assets (IFRS, 2014)
defines these as meeting three conditions:

• identifiable, non-monetary asset without physical substance
• controllable by the business (by purchase or internally created)
• from which future benefits are expected to occur.

Identifiable, in this case, means either being separable (can be sold, transferred, rented,
or exchanged) or arising from contractual or other legally enforceable rights. Intangible assets are non-monetary assets because they have inherent values based on their
use in business. Cash, on the other hand, is a monetary asset because its value is
based on what it represents since the paper the cash is printed on has very little value by
itself, as was discussed in the cash and receivables chapter.
Intangible assets are not to be confused with goodwill. If BioWare was to sell their entire
business to a third party for more than the sum of the fair values of their identifiable assets
net of liabilities (net identifiable assets), then the excess amount of the fair value of the
consideration paid over the net identifiable assets by the purchaser would be classified
as goodwill. The additional amount that the purchaser is willing to pay may be due to
a brilliantly creative software development team with extraordinary talents that has value
to the purchaser. Even though goodwill is inherently part of the purchase and has no
physical presence, it is not classified as an intangible asset. This is because it is not
separately identifiable from the other assets, nor does it have any contractual or other
legally enforceable rights. For this reason, it does not meet the definition of an intangible
asset and is therefore classified separately as goodwill, which is discussed later in the
chapter.
Some types of intangible assets are listed below.

• Patents, copyrights, databases, software, and website development costs
• Trademarks and trade names
• Franchise agreements’ initial fees and closing costs
• Purchased-only customer lists, brands, or publishing titles

11.2. Intangible Assets: Initial Recognition and Measurement

411

In a Canadian context, intangible assets have the following characteristics:

• Patents are sole rights granted by the Canadian Patent Office to exclude others
from making, using, or selling an invention. They expire after twenty years. Patents
limit competition and therefore they provide incentive for companies or individuals
to continue developing innovative new products or services. For example, pharmaceutical companies spend large sums on research and development, so patents are
essential to earning a profit.
• Copyrights grant exclusive legal right to the author to copy, publish, perform, film, or
record literary, artistic, or musical material. A copyright protects authors during their
lifetimes and for fifty years after that. A recent example of copyright infringement
involves Michael Robertson, CEO of the now-bankrupt MP3.com. The former chief
executive of the online music storage firm MP3Tunes was found liable in March
2014 for infringing copyrights for sound recordings, compositions, and cover art
associated with artists including the Beatles, Coldplay, and David Bowie (Raymond,
2014).
• Trademarks are a symbol, logo, brand, emblem, word, or words legally registered or
established by use as representing a company or product. Coca Cola is an example.
Trademarks are renewable after fifteen years, so they can have an indefinite life.
• Industrial design (ID) creates and develops concepts and specifications that improve
the function, value, and appearance of products and systems. Registration of the
design results in exclusive rights being granted for ten years.

11.2 Intangible Assets: Initial Recognition and
Measurement
Recognition as an intangible asset is based on both criteria being met:

1. the probability that benefits will flow to the business and
2. the asset cost can be reliably measured.

If these are not met, then the item is expensed when it is incurred.
If the three conditions of an intangible asset and the two recognition criteria above are
met, then the intangible asset is:

412

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

• initially measured at cost
• subsequently measured at cost (or measured using the revaluation model for IFRS)
• amortized on a systematic basis over its useful life (unless the asset has an indefinite
useful life, in which case it is not amortized). For IFRS, the intangible asset is tested
annually for impairment.

Intangible assets can be acquired:

• as a separate purchase
• as part of a business combination (either through the purchase of the business’s
assets or acquiring the controlling shares of the business)
• by an exchange of assets
• by a government grant
• by self-creation (internally developed)

11.2.1 Purchased Intangible Assets
Costs are capitalized to intangible assets the same way as is done for property, plant, and
equipment. As a basic review, capital costs include the acquisition cost, legal fees, and
any direct costs required to get the intangible asset ready for use. If intangible assets are
purchased with other assets, the cost is then allocated to each asset based on relative
fair values (basket purchase). Other costs, such as training to use the asset, marketing,
administration or general overhead, interest charges due to late payment for the asset
purchase, and any costs incurred after the asset is put into its intended use, are expensed
as incurred.
Like property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets that are purchased in exchange for
other monetary and/or non-monetary assets are measured at either the fair value of the
assets given up or the fair value of the intangible asset received, whichever is the most
reliable measure, if there is commercial substance. When an exchange lacks commercial
substance, the assets received are measured at the lessor of the carrying amount or the
fair value of the assets given up.
If a company receives an intangible asset at no cost or for a nominal cost in the form of
a government grant such as a grant of timber rights, then the fair value of the intangible
asset acquired is typically the amount recorded.

11.2. Intangible Assets: Initial Recognition and Measurement

413

11.2.2 Internally Developed Intangible Assets
All company activities to create new products or substantially improve existing products
are to be separated into a research phase and a development phase for the various
costs incurred. Below is a summary of the two phases and their accounting treatment
(IFRS, 2014; IAS 38 Intangible Assets):
Research Phase:
All original and planned
investigation activities including evaluating and selecting products or processes from several possible alternatives. If there
is any uncertainty about
which phase is appropriate
for an activity, then the research phase is used.

Development Phase:
This is where the application of research findings
before commercial production begins. It includes designing, testing and constructing prototypes, models,
pilot plants chosen from the alternatives identified in
the research phase, as well as costs for any new tools,
templates, or castings.

IAS 38: the six criteria
must ALL be met to be
capitalized, otherwise
costs are expensed as
incurred.
All costs are expensed as
incurred because the
activities do not relate to
an identifiable product or
process.

Costs that are initially expensed because they do
not meet the six criteria
above cannot be capitalized later.

1) Technical feasibility of
completing the intangible
asset must be proven.
2) Management intention
exists to complete it for use
or for sale.
3) The entity must be able
to use or sell it.
4) Adequate resources to
complete the development
and to use or sell the intangible asset are available.
5) Probability of future
economic benefits is
clearly established and
are reasonably certain,
such as the existence of a
market or the usefulness
of the intangible asset to
the entity.
6) Costs can be reliably
measured

414

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Typical ineligible costs for
capitalization:

Once the six criteria are
met, direct costs that are
eligible:

Business start-up costs,
training, advertising and
promotion, relocation, reorganization costs or any
costs after the asset is
ready for use/sale. Internally generated branding or
customer lists are also excluded from capitalization
because they are indistinguishable from other business costs.
Any external or internal
costs directly attributable
to the specific asset such
as direct materials and direct labour (i.e., salaries
and benefits), as well as
other direct costs such as
engineering costs, and any
directly attributable overhead costs.

Once the intangible asset
is ready for its intended
use, then any subsequent
costs are expensed and no
longer capitalized.

For ASPE, CPA Handbook, Sec. 3064, Goodwill and Intangible Assets (CPA Canada,
2016), allows a choice between expensing the costs for internally developed intangibles
or recognizing the intangible asset when certain criteria (similar to the criteria above) are
met.

11.2.3 Intangible Assets: Subsequent Measurement
After the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement is as follows:
• ASPE–Cost model only
• IFRS–Cost model. If the intangible asset has its fair values determined in an active
market, then the Revaluation model can be used. The Revaluation model is not

11.2. Intangible Assets: Initial Recognition and Measurement

415

widely used in actual practice since an active market for intangible assets usually
does not exist.
The accounting treatment under both models is applied the same way as is applied to
property, plant, and equipment. Since intangible assets rarely have an active market
to provide readily available fair values, discussions in this chapter will focus on the cost
model.
Cost Model
• Asset is initially recorded upon acquisition at its cost.
• Subsequently, its carrying value will be at cost less accumulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses since acquisition, if any.
• On disposal, its carrying value is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
(sales proceeds minus the carrying value) is reported in net income.
An intangible asset with a limited useful life will be amortized over its estimated useful life,
like plant and equipment, as follows:
• Amortization can be calculated using the units of production or straight-line methods,
but usually assuming a residual value of zero (unless it can be sold to a third party).
The method to use is determined using similar criteria as plant and equipment.
Nearly all intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method with no
residual value unless there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise.
• Estimating useful life considers criteria such as expected use of the assets, any limits imposed by law, statute, or contract, and the impact on value from obsolescence
and technology advances. If a patent has a legal life of twenty years but expects a
competing product to emerge in fifteen years, then the useful life would be the lesser
of the two, or fifteen years.
• Amortization begins and ends according to when the asset is ready for use and
when it is to be disposed of or sold.
• Amortization policy is reviewed in terms of the asset’s useful life, amortization method,
and residual value, if any.
• Changes in useful life, residual value (if any), and amortization method are changes
in accounting estimates and accounted for prospectively.
• Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the end of each reporting period
(IFRS), or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may
not be recoverable (ASPE).

416

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

If the intangible asset has an indefinite life, no amortization is recorded, but it will be
subject to review at the end of each reporting period. Should this status change to a
definite life, it is treated as a change in estimate and accounted for prospectively. Indefinite
life assets are also subject to impairment reviews and adjustments.

11.2.4 Intangible Assets: Impairment and Derecognition
The process of impairment and derecognition of intangible assets is like that of property,
plant, and equipment. Below is a summary of two models used for definite-life and
indefinite-life intangible assets.
ASPE Cost Recovery Impairment Model
Assumes that the asset will continue to be
used. The asset is impaired only if the
carrying value of the asset is more than
the sum of the net future undiscounted
cash flows from both the use and eventual
disposal of the asset.

Impairment

IFRS: Rational Entity Impairment Model
Assumes that the asset will either continue
to be used or disposed of, depending upon
which results in a higher return. The asset
is impaired only if the carrying value of the
asset is more than the asset’s recoverable
amount (a discounted cash flow concept),
being the higher of its value in use and its
fair value less costs to sell.

Amortization calculation after impairment for both ASPE and IFRS is based on the adjusted carrying value after impairment, the revised residual value (if any), and the asset’s
estimated remaining useful life.

Revised amortization =

carrying value after impairment − revised residual value (if any)
Estimated remaining useful life

When an intangible asset is disposed of, the difference between the net proceeds and
the asset’s carrying value is the gain or loss reported in net income. The asset and its
accumulated amortization are removed from the accounts.

11.3 Goodwill
11.3.1 Initial Recognition and Measurement
Goodwill arises when one company purchases another business and pays more than the
fair value of its net identifiable assets (total identifiable assets – identifiable liabilities).
This excess amount of consideration paid by the purchaser is classified as goodwill. As
discussed at the beginning of this chapter, since goodwill is not a separately identifiable
asset and has no contractual or other legally enforceable rights, it does not meet the
definition of an intangible asset. It is therefore classified separately as goodwill on the
SFP/BS. Also, a third-party purchase is the only circumstance where goodwill can be

11.3. Goodwill

419

recognized. This is due to the complexities of recognizing and measuring internally
generated goodwill, which lacks any arm’s-length third-party associations.
All the identifiable assets and identifiable liabilities received are initially recorded by the
purchaser at their fair values at the date of purchase. The difference between the sum
of the fair values and the purchase price (or the fair value of any consideration given up)
is classified and recorded as goodwill. Consideration can be cash or other assets, notes
payable, shares, or other equity instruments.
For example, on January 1, Otis Equipment Ltd. purchases the net identifiable assets
of Waverly Corp. for $40M cash and a short-term promissory note for $12M. Waverly’s
unclassified year-end balance sheet as at December 31 is shown below.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Differences between fair values and the carrying values of the net identifiable assets are
common. For example, the accounts receivable may be adjusted because the bad debt
estimate was not sufficient. Inventory may be adjusted due to obsolescence or due to
a recent decline in prices from the supplier. Long-term assets values for property, plant,
and equipment are usually determined either by independent appraisals or from published
pricing guides such as those used for vehicles. Vehicles will lose value as they age, but
land and buildings can appreciate over time. The patent may have been assessed a zero
value because it was almost fully amortized and was due to expire the next year. Fair
values for current liabilities such as accounts payable are usually the same as their book
values. Long-term liabilities may require adjustments if interest rates have significantly
changed.
The total consideration given up by Otis is $52M combined cash and short-term promissory note compared to the fair value of the net identifiable assets of $50M. The $2M
difference will be classified as goodwill. As previously stated, goodwill is not an identifiable
asset on its own but simply that portion of the purchase price not specifically accounted for
by the net identifiable assets. In other words, goodwill represents the future economic
benefits arising from other assets acquired in the business acquisition that cannot
be identified separately.

Any transaction costs incurred by Otis associated with the purchase would be expensed
as incurred.
There are many reasons why Otis was willing to pay an additional $2M to purchase
Waverly. Waverly may possess a top credit rating with its creditors, an excellent reputation
for quality products and service, a highly competent management team, or highly skilled
employees. These factors will positively affect the total future earning power and hence
the value of the business entity.
If Waverly accepted an offer from Otis of $49M and the fair values of the net identifiable
assets of $50M were re-examined and considered accurate, then the $1M difference

11.3. Goodwill

421

would be recorded by Otis as a gain (credit) from the acquisition of assets in net income.
This is referred to as a bargain purchase.

11.3.2 Subsequent Measurement of Goodwill
Once purchased, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and not amortized, but it
is evaluated for impairment. Under IFRS, this is done annually and whenever there is an
indication that impairment exists. For ASPE this is done whenever circumstances indicate
that an impairment exists.
Since goodwill is not a separately identifiable asset, it is allocated to reporting (ASPE) or
cash generating units (CGUs; IFRS) expected to benefit from the business acquisition on
the acquisition date.
For ASPE, after testing and adjusting the individual assets of the CGU as required,
impairment is then applied to the whole reporting unit the same as for intangible assets
with an indefinite life. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value,
this difference is the impairment amount.
For IFRS, if the carrying value of the CGU is greater than the recoverable amount (which
is the higher of the CGU’s value in use or fair value less costs to sell) then this difference is
the impairment amount. Impairment is allocated first to goodwill (accumulated impairment
losses, goodwill account), with any further excess allocated to the remaining assets’
carrying values in the CGU on a proportional basis.
Goodwill impairment reversals are not permitted for ASPE or IFRS.
For example, assume that Calter Ltd. purchased Turnton Inc. and identified it as a reporting unit (CGU). The goodwill amount that was recorded at acquisition was $40,000 and
the carrying amount of the whole unit, including goodwill was $360,000. One year later,
due to an economic downturn in that industry sector, management is assessing whether
the unit has incurred an impairment of its net identifiable assets. The fair value of the unit
was evaluated to be $330,000. The direct costs to sell would be $9,300 and the unit’s

The net carrying value for goodwill will be $10,000 ($40,000 − 30,000). Since individual
asset testing and adjustments within the unit was done prior to the evaluation of the whole
unit, the impairment amount would not exceed goodwill.

The net carrying value for goodwill after the impairment is $20,000 ($40,000 − 20,000).
Had the impairment amount exceeded the $40,000 goodwill carrying value, the amount
of the difference would be allocated to the remaining net identifiable assets on a prorated
basis, since there had been no impairment testing of individual assets as was done for
ASPE above.

11.4 Disclosures of Intangible Assets and Goodwill
For reporting purposes, intangible assets are grouped together with similar other intangible assets. Some examples of these classes are patents, copyrights, computer
software, or industrial designs. Most of the disclosures will be in the notes to the financial

11.5. Analysis

423

statements. Disclosures for ASPE are simpler than IFRS. For each class, some of the
most important disclosures are listed below.

• Identify if the intangible assets have a definite or indefinite life, or were purchased
or internally developed.
• Identify useful life, amortization policy and rate, the accumulated amortization for
definite-life assets, and carrying amount for both definite- and indefinite-life assets.
• Disclose amortization amounts included in the line items of the statement of income
or comprehensive income.
• Disclose the amount of research and development costs expensed through net
income.
• Reconcile the beginning and ending balances of each class of intangibles, including acquisitions, increases in internally generated intangibles, amortizations, and
impairments.
• Goodwill is reported as a separate line item with its carrying value and impairments
amounts disclosed.
• Disclose capitalization policies.

11.5 Analysis
Analysis of financial statements will be affected by how intangible assets are accounted
for. For example, companies that follow ASPE can either capitalize or expense their
internally developed intangibles, depending upon company policy. More flexibility means
less comparability when evaluating performance with other companies within the industry
sector. Policy changes regarding intangible assets are treated prospectively within a company. This can also impact comparability within the company when analyzing performance
trends over time. For IFRS companies, once the six conditions and criteria are met for
internally developed intangibles, they are capitalized as assets. This results in greater
comparability when analyzing performance.
Another issue involves company valuations. The SFP/BS does not always capture the
company’s true value. This in turn will affect performance evaluation within the company
and within its industry sector. Recall the discussion at the beginning of this chapter regarding BioWare, whereby the company’s total value can increase due to the development
of creative software development teams with extraordinary talents or perhaps a superior
management team. Since these cannot be measured reliably, they are not reported in any
of the financial statements. There is no doubt that these attributes are relevant and will

424

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

positively affect the company’s total value, but without quantification within the financial
statements, they will likely have little impact on decision-making such as what a creditor
would be willing to loan the company to expand their markets, or what additional monies
a purchaser might be willing to pay to purchase the company.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe intangible assets and goodwill and their role in
accounting and business.
Intangible assets and goodwill can have significant balances reported in a company’s
SFP/BS. To be classified as an intangible asset, it must be identifiable, non-monetary,
without physical substance, be controllable by business, and with expected future ben-

426

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

efits. Some examples of intangible assets are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and
purchased customer lists. Goodwill, on the other hand, can only occur because of a
purchase of another company’s net identifiable assets. Any excess proceeds paid over
the total fair value of these net identifiable assets will be classified and reported separately
as goodwill.

LO 2: Describe intangible assets and explain how they are
recognized and measured.
To be recognized as an intangible asset for accounting purposes, there must be a probability that future benefits will accrue to the business and that they can be reliably measured. If not, the item is expensed as incurred. Intangible assets can be acquired as a
separate purchase or as part of a business combination, in exchange for other assets,
as part of a government grant or as internally developed. Intangible assets are initially
measured at cost. Initial costs that can be capitalized to the asset are any direct costs
required to get the asset ready for use. Any costs incurred after the asset is put into use
are expensed.
Intangible assets that are internally developed are subject to more stringent criteria and
are separated into research and development phases. Research phase costs are expensed as incurred because there is no identifiable product or process yet. Development
phase costs meeting all six criteria can be capitalized. Initial costs that can be capitalized
are any direct costs required to get the asset ready for use. All other costs are expensed
and cannot be capitalized at later.
Once the asset is in use, it is usually subsequently measured at amortized cost or cost
(ASPE or IFRS) or, less often, using the fair-value based revaluation model (IFRS only).
Definite-life intangible assets are amortized on a systematic basis the same as property,
plant, and equipment. Indefinite-life assets are not amortized but the indefinite-life status
is subject to review.
Evaluation for impairment is undertaken at certain points over time for all intangible assets
the same as is done for property, plant, and equipment. For definite life intangibles, ASPE
evaluates for indicators of impairment only when circumstances indicate impairment is a
possibility as determined by a recoverability test that compares the carrying value with
the undiscounted future cash flows. If impaired, the asset’s carrying value is reduced
to equal the fair value at that date and the loss on impairment is reported in net income.
Impairment reversals are not permitted.
IFRS evaluates for indicators of impairment at the end of each year. There is no impairment test. If impaired, the asset carrying value is reduced to equal the recoverable
amount (the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell). Impairment

Chapter Summary

427

reversals are limited and cannot exceed the asset’s carrying value without any impairment
adjustments.
For indefinite intangible assets, ASPE evaluates for indicators of impairment only when
circumstances indicate impairment is a possibility as determined by a fair value test that
compares the carrying value with the fair value. If impaired, the asset’s carrying value is
reduced to equal the fair value at that date and the loss on impairment is reported in net
income. As was the case for definite-life intangibles, impairment reversal is not permitted.
For IFRS, indefinite-life intangibles are treated the same as definite-life intangibles regarding impairment evaluation and measurement.
Amortization is based on the adjusted carrying value after impairment, the revised residual value, and the estimated remaining useful life.
On disposal, the asset is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss reported in net
income.

LO 3: Describe goodwill and explain how it is recognized and
measured.
Goodwill can only arise from a third-party purchase of another company’s net identifiable
assets. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the consideration price (e.g.,
cash, other assets, notes payable, shares) and the fair value of the net identifiable assets;
it is reported separately as a long-term asset on the SFP/BS. The purchaser records all
the net identifiable assets at their fair values and any resulting goodwill on the SFP/BS
as at the purchase date. If the purchase price were to be less than the fair value of the
net identifiable assets, the difference would be credited as a gain from the acquisition of
assets in net income.
Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life, so it is not amortized. Goodwill is
assigned as part of a reporting or cash-generating unit (CGU), and the whole unit is
assessed for impairment using the same measurement criteria as for intangible assets
with an indefinite life. The only difference is that goodwill impairment reversals are not
allowed for either ASPE or IFRS.

428

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

LO 4: Identify the disclosure requirements for intangible assets and
goodwill.
For reporting purposes, intangible assets are usually grouped with other intangibles with
similar characteristics. For ASPE, the disclosures are simpler than for IFRS companies.
Most of the disclosures are made in the notes to the financial statements. Disclosures
include separate reporting into various classes for definite-life and indefinite-life intangibles, with goodwill being reported separately. Amortization and capitalization policies,
amortization amounts, impairment assessments and amounts, and reconciliations of beginning to ending balances for each class of intangible asset disclosures are also required.
Amounts expensed for amortization expense and research and development costs are
also disclosed.

LO 5: Describe how intangible assets and goodwill affect the
analysis of company performance.
Comparability is affected by the differences between how the accounting standards are
applied for purchased assets versus internally developed intangibles and goodwill for both
ASPE and IFRS companies. Any changes in accounting policies are treated prospectively,
making comparability within a company or between companies over time more difficult.
Valuation issues are significant regarding unreported intangible assets that have been
expensed because the conditions and criteria identified in the ASPE and IFRS standards
to qualify as an asset were not met. Since these are not reported on the SFP/BS, valuation
of these companies becomes increasingly more difficult.

LO 6: Explain the similarities and differences between ASPE and
IFRS for recognition, measurement, and reporting for intangible
assets and goodwill.
The differences between ASPE and IFRS arise regarding the following.

1. There is a choice to capitalize or expense internally developed intangible assets for
ASPE companies. For IFRS, there is no choice: if they meet the conditions and
criteria, then these expenses are to be capitalized.
2. Evaluation and measurement of impairment losses.
3. The extent of the required disclosures in the financial statements.

Below is select information for the following independent transactions for Hilde Co., an
ASPE company:

436

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

i. On January 1, 2015, a patent was purchased from another company for $900,000.
The useful life is estimated to be fifteen years. At the time of the sale, the patent had
a carrying value on the seller’s books of $915,000. A year later, Hilde re-assessed
the patent to have only ten years’ useful life at that time.
ii. During 2015, Hilde incurred $350,000 in costs to develop a new electronic product. Of this amount, $180,000 was incurred before the product was deemed to
be technologically and financially feasible. By December 31, 2015, the project was
completed. The company estimates that the useful life of the product to be ten years,
and earnings are estimated to be $3.6 million over its useful life. Hilde’s policy is to
capitalize any costs meeting the ASPE criteria.
iii. On January 1, 2015, a franchise was purchased for $1.8 million. In addition, Hilde
must also pay 2% of revenue from operations to the franchisor. For the year ended
2015, the revenue from the franchise was $5.6 million. Hilde estimates that the
useful life of the franchise is forty years.
iv. During 2015, the following research costs were incurred; materials and equipment of
$25,000; salaries and benefits of $250,000; and indirect overhead costs of $15,000.
(Assume a single entry in 2015 for these costs.)

Required:

a. For each independent situation above, prepare all relevant journal entries including
any adjusting entries for 2015 (and 2016 for situation i) for Hilde Co. Hilde’s year-end
is December 31 and follows ASPE.
b. Prepare a partial income statement and balance sheet for 2015, including all required disclosures. Income tax rate is 27%.
c. Explain how the accounting treatment for each of the situations above would differ if
Hilde was a public company that followed IFRS.

On January 4, 2015, a research project undertaken by Nasja Ltd. was completed and a
patent was approved. The research phase of the project incurred costs of $150,000, and
legal costs incurred to obtain the patent approval were $20,000. The patent is assessed
to have a useful life to 2025, or for ten years. Early in 2016, Nasja successfully defended
the patent against a competitor, incurring a legal cost of $22,000. This set a precedent for
Nasja who was able to reassess the patent’s useful life to 2030. During 2017, Nasja
was able to create a product design that was feasible for commercialization, but no
more certainty was known at that time. Costs to get the product design to this stage
were $250,000. Additional engineering and consulting fees of $50,000 were incurred to
advance the design to the manufacturing stage. Nasja follows IFRS.

EXERCISE 2–1
Information asymmetry simply means that one party to a business transaction has more
information than the other party. This problem is demonstrated by the situation where
business managers know more about the business’s operations than outside parties (e.g.,
investors and lenders). The information asymmetry problem can take two forms—adverse
selection and moral hazard. With adverse selection, a manager may choose to act on
inside knowledge of the business in a way that harms outside parties. Insider trading
by managers using non-public knowledge may distort market prices of securities and
create distrust in investors. Accounting attempts to deal with the problem by providing
as much timely information to the market as possible. Moral hazard occurs when a
manager shirks or otherwise performs in a substandard fashion, knowing that his or her
performance as an agent is not directly observable by the principal (owner). Accounting
tries to deal with this problem by providing information to business owners that can help
assess management’s level of performance. Although the field of accounting does attempt
to solve these problems through the provision of high quality information, information
asymmetry can never be completely eliminated, so the accounting profession will always
seek ways to improve the usefulness of accounting information.

EXERCISE 2–2
Canada allows privately-owned businesses to use Accounting Standards for Private Enterprise (ASPE) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), while requiring
publicly accountable enterprises to use IFRS. IFRS is partially or fully recognized in
over 125 countries as the appropriate accounting standard for companies that trade
shares in public markets. The main advantage of using a consistent standard around the
world is that investors can understand and compare investment opportunities in different
countries without having to make conversions or adjustments to reported results. This is
an important feature as markets have become more globalized and capital more mobile.
By requiring IFRS for publicly-traded companies, Canada has attempted to maintain the
competitiveness of these companies in international financial markets. By allowing private
441

442

Solutions To Exercises

companies the option to report under ASPE instead, standard setters have created an
environment that could be more responsive to local needs and unique, Canadian business
circumstances. As well, many features of ASPE are simpler to apply than IFRS, which
may reduce accounting costs for small, non-public businesses.
The major disadvantage of maintaining two sets of standards is cost. The burden of
standard setters is increased, and these costs will ultimately be passed on to businesses
that are required to report. As well, having two sets of standards may create confusion
among investors and lenders, as public and private company financial statements may
not be directly comparable.

EXERCISE 2–3
The conceptual framework is a high-level structure of concepts established by accounting
standard setters to help facilitate the consistent and logical formulation of standards, and
provide a basis for the use of judgment in resolving accounting issues. This framework
is essential to standard setters as they develop new accounting standards in response to
changes in the economic environment. The framework gives the standard setters a basis
and set of defining principles from which to develop new standards. The framework is also
useful to practicing accountants, as it can provide guidance to them when interpreting
unusual or new business transactions. The framework gives practicing accountants the
tools and support to critically evaluate accounting treatments of specific transactions that
may not appear to fit into standard definitions or norms. Without a proper conceptual
framework, accounting standards may become inconsistent and ad-hoc, and their application may result in financial statements that are not comparable, resulting in less
confidence in capital markets.

EXERCISE 2–4
The two fundamental characteristics of good accounting information are relevance and
faithful representation. Relevance means that the piece of information has the ability
to influence one’s decisions. This characteristic exists if the information helps predict
future events or confirm predictions made in the past. Some relevant information may
have both predictive and confirmatory value, or it may only meet one of these needs.
Faithful representation means that the information being presented represents the true
economic state or condition of the item being reported on. Faithful representation is
achieved if the information is complete, neutral, and free from error. Complete information
reports all the factors necessary for the reader to fully understand the underlying nature
of the economic event. This may mean that additional narrative disclosures are required
as well as the quantitative value. Neutral information is unbiased and does not favour
one particular outcome or prediction over another. Freedom from error means that the

Chapter 2 Solutions

443

reported information is correct, but it does not have to be 100% error free. The concept
of materiality allows for insignificant errors to still be present in the information, as long as
those errors have no influence on a reader’s decisions. Although both relevance and faithful representation need to be present for information to be considered useful, accountants
face difficulties in achieving maximum levels of both characteristics simultaneously. As a
result, trade-offs are often required, which may lead to imperfect information. Accountants
are also often faced with a trade-off between costs and benefits. It may be too costly to
guarantee 100% accuracy, so a little faithful representation may need to be given up to
maintain the relevance of the information. This means that the accountant will need to
apply good judgment in balancing the trade-offs in a way that maximizes the usefulness
of the information.

EXERCISE 2–5
The four enhancing qualitative characteristics are comparability, verifiability, timeliness,
and understandability. Comparability means information from two or more different businesses or from the same business over different time periods can be compared. Verifiability means two independent and knowledgeable observers could come to the same
conclusion about the information being presented. Timeliness means that information
needs to be current and not out of date. The older the information, the less useful it
becomes for decision-making purposes. Understandability means that a reader with a
reasonable understanding of business transactions should be able to understand the
meaning of the accounting information being disclosed. Timeliness is often in conflict
with verifiability, as verification of information takes time. Financial statements are almost
always issued under deadlines; the optimal level of verification may not be achieved.
Likewise, understandability may be enhanced with more careful drafting of the supplemental disclosures, but time constraints may interfere with this function. Understandability and comparability may both be influenced by the company’s need to keep certain
information confidential in order to avoid giving away a competitive advantage. All of
these characteristics may be influenced by matters of cost. Businesses will make rational
decisions by weighing the costs of certain actions against the benefits received. Cost
considerations may result in accounting information not achieving the maximum levels of
all of the qualitative characteristics. Balancing the trade-offs of these characteristics with
the cost considerations is one of the largest challenges faced by practicing accountants.

EXERCISE 2–7
An item is recognized in the financial statements if it: (a) meets the definition of an
element, (b) can result in probable future economic benefits to or from the entity, and
(c) can be measured reliably. These criteria can be applied as follows.

a. The company has received an asset, but the company has not yet achieved substantial performance of the contract. The contract will be performed as issues of the
magazines are delivered. Thus, the appropriate offsetting element to the asset is
a liability, as a future obligation is created. As each issue is delivered, the liability
is reduced and income can be recognized. The amount can be measured reliably,
as the cash has already been received and the price of each magazine issue has
already been determined.
b. The appropriate element here is the liability that is being created by the lawsuit.
Because the lawsuit results from a past event that creates a present obligation
to pay an amount in the future, the definition of a liability is met. It also appears
that the outflow of economic benefits is probable, based on the lawyer’s evaluation.
However, if there really is no way to reliably measure the amount, then the liability
should not be recognized. However, the lawyers should make a reasonable effort
based on prior case law, the facts of the case, and so forth, to see if an amount
can be reliably estimated. Even if the amount is not recognized, the lawsuit should
still be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements as this information is likely
relevant to those reading the financial statement.

Chapter 2 Solutions

445

c. An asset is normally created and income recognized when the invoice is issued.
The future economic benefit exists, is the result of a past event, and can be measured reliably, based on the terms of the contract. In this case, however, there is
some issue regarding the probability of realizing the future economic benefits. A
careful analysis of the situation is required to determine if recognition of an asset
is appropriate. Only the amount whose collection can be deemed probable should
be recognized. Even if the amount is not recognized, the contract should still be
disclosed in the supplemental information, as this information is likely relevant to
financial statement readers.
d. The question of whether this meets the definition of an asset needs to be addressed.
Is the goodwill being recorded a “resource controlled by the entity”? Goodwill, by
definition, is intangible, but it is not clear what exactly is generating the goodwill in
this case. It is difficult to say that this even meets the definition of an asset. If this
definitional argument is stretched, it would still be difficult to recognize the element,
as it is unlikely to pass the reliable measurement test. An asset based on the current
share price is not reliably measured, as share prices are volatile and transitory. No
recognition of the asset and corresponding equity amount is warranted in this case.
e. This does appear to meet the definition of a liability, as the past event (the drilling)
results in a present obligation (the requirement to clean up the site) in the future.
This type of liability should normally be recorded at the present value of the expected
outflow of resources in 10 years time, as this outflow is probable. The company
may have some difficulty measuring the amount, as they have no experience with
this type of operation. However, an estimate should be able to be made using
engineering estimates, industry data, and so forth. The other item that needs
to be estimated is the appropriate discount rate for the present value calculation.
Again, the company can use its cost of capital or other appropriate measure for this
purpose. This liability and an expense should be recognized, although estimation
will be required. Additional details of the method of estimation would also need to
be disclosed.

EXERCISE 2–8
The four measurement bases are historical cost, current cost, realizable (settlement)
value, and present value. Historical cost represents the actual transaction cost of an
element. This is normally very reliably measured, but may not be particularly relevant
for current decision making purposes. Current cost represents the amount required to
replace the current capacity of the particular asset being considered, or the amount
of undiscounted cash currently required to settle the liability. This base is considered
more relevant than historical cost, as it attempts to use current market information to
value the item. However, many items, particularly special purpose assets, do not have
active markets and are, thus, not reliably measured by this approach. Realizable value

446

Solutions To Exercises

represents the amount that an asset can currently be sold for in an orderly fashion (i.e.,
not a “fire-sale” price) or the amount required to settle a liability in the normal course of
business. Again, this has the advantage of using current market conditions, making it
more relevant than historical cost. However, as with current cost, active disposal markets
for the asset may not exist. As well, realizable value is criticized as being irrelevant in
cases where the company has no intention of disposing of the asset for many years.
Present value is, perhaps, the most theoretically justified measurement base. In this
case, all assets and liabilities are measured at the present value of the related future
cash flows. This measure is highly relevant, as it represents the value in use to the
organization. The problem with this approach is that it is difficult to reliably estimate the
timing and probability of the future cash flows. As well, determinations need to be made
regarding the appropriate discount rate, which may not always have a clear answer.

EXERCISE 2–9
Capital maintenance refers to the amount of capital that investors would want to be
maintained within the business. This concept is important to investors, as the level of
capital maintenance required may influence an investor’s choice as to which company to
invest in. The measurement of an investor’s capital can be defined in terms of financial
capital or physical capital.
Financial capital maintenance simply looks at the amount of money in a business, measured by changes in the owners’ equity. This can be measured simply by looking at
monetary amounts reported in the financial statements. The problem with this approach
is that it doesn’t take into account purchasing power changes over time. The constant
purchasing power model attempts to get around this problem by adjusting capital requirements for inflation by using a broadly based index, such as the Consumer Price Index.
The problem with this approach is that the index chosen may not accurately reflect the
actual level of inflation experienced by the company. Physical capital maintenance tries
to get around this problem by measuring the physical capacity of the business, rather
than the financial capacity. The advantage of this approach is that it measures the actual
productivity of the business and is not affected by inflation. The disadvantage of this
method is that it is not easy or cost-effective to measure the productive capacity of each
asset within the business.
Because each capital maintenance model involves trade-offs, the conceptual framework
does not draw a conclusion on which approach is the best. Rather, it suggests that end
needs of the financial statement users be considered when determining to apply capital
maintenance concepts to specific accounting standards.

Principles-based standards present a series of basic concepts that professional accountants can use to make decisions about the appropriate accounting treatment of individual
transactions. Rules-based standards, on the other hand, are more prescriptive and
detailed. These standards attempt to create a rule for any situation the accountant may
encounter. The main advantage of principles-based systems is their flexibility. They allow
the accountant the latitude to apply judgment to deal with new situations or unusual
circumstances. This flexibility, however, can also cause problems for the accountant,
as there could be pressure to stretch the professional judgment in a way that creates
misleading financial statements. As well, the application of judgment in the preparation
of financial statement could result in reports that are not comparable, as other accountants may arrive at different conclusions for similar transactions. This suggests that
the verifiability characteristic may also be compromised. The main advantage of rulesbased approaches is the certainty and comparability offered by detailed rules. Readers
can have confidence that similar transactions are reported in similar ways. As well,
this may reduce the accountant’s professional liability, as long as the rules have been
applied correctly. The main disadvantage of the rules-based systems is their inflexibility.
Prescription of specific accounting treatments can result in financial engineering, wherein
new transactions are designed solely for the purpose of circumventing the rules. This
can create misleading financial reports, where the true nature of the transactions is not
reflected correctly. As well, overly detailed rules can create a problem of understandability,
not only for the readers, but even for the professional accountants themselves. As a
practical matter, all systems of accounting regulation contain both broad principles and
detailed rules. The challenge for accounting standard setters is to find the right balance
of rules and principles.

EXERCISE 2–11
Managers may attempt to influence the outcome of financial reporting for a number of reasons. Managers may have bonus or other compensation schemes that are directly tied to
reported results. Managers are rational in attempting to influence their own compensation,
as they understand that compensation earned now is more valuable than compensation
that is deferred to future periods. Even if the manager’s compensation is not directly tied to
financial results, the manager may still have an incentive to make the company’s results
look as good as possible, as this would enhance the manager’s reputation and future
employment prospects. Managers will also feel pressure from shareholders to maintain a
certain level of financial performance, as public securities markets can be very punitive to
a company’s share price when earnings targets are not reached. Shareholders do not like
to see the price of the share fall drastically. On the other hand, shareholders also want to
have a realistic assessment of the company’s earning potential. These conflicting goals
may create a complicated dynamic for the manager’s behaviour in crafting the financial
statements. Managers are also influenced by the conditions of certain contracts, such
as loan agreements. Loan covenants may require the maintenance of certain financial
ratios, which clearly puts pressure on managers to influence the financial reports in a

448

Solutions To Exercises

certain fashion. Managers may also feel pressure to keep earnings low where there
are political consequences of being too profitable. This may occur when a company
has disproportionate power over the market, or where there is a public interest in the
operations of the business. The company does not want to demonstrate earnings that
are too high, as it risks attracting additional taxation, penalties, or other actions that may
restrict future business.
The pressures that managers feel to influence financial results will eventually find their way
to the accountant, as the accountant is ultimately responsible for creating the financial
statements. Whether the accountant is internal or external to the business, his or her
work must be performed ethically and professionally. The accountant must always act
with integrity and objectivity, and must avoid being influenced by the pressures that may
be exerted by managers or other parties. The accountant must demonstrate professional
competence and must keep client information confidential. The accountant should not
engage in any work that falls outside of the scope of that accountant’s professional capabilities. As well, the accountant must not engage in any behaviour that discredits the
profession. Although it is easy to describe the accountant’s professional responsibilities,
it is not always easy to put these concepts into practice. The accountant needs to be
aware of the pressures faced in the reporting environment, and may need to seek outside
advice when faced with ethical or professional problems. Ultimately, the accountant is a
key player in establishing the overall credibility of financial reporting, and financial markets
rely on this credibility to function in an efficient manner.

EXERCISE 2–12
The vice-president finance’s comments hint at a threat to my objectivity as financial controller. The potential reward of the vice-president finance position should not influence
how I perform my professional duties. The specific issues identified by the vice-president
finance can be addressed as follows.

a. This lawsuit appears to meet the definition of a liability, as it is a present obligation
that results from a past transaction and will require a future outflow of economic
resources. As well, it appears to have satisfied the recognition criteria, as the
payment is probable and the amount can be estimated. This amount should be
accrued this year, although prior years’ financial statements do not need to be
adjusted. Further consultation with the lawyers is required to determine the most
reasonable amount to accrue within the range provided. Also, IFRS and ASPE use
different approaches to accounting for provisions based on a range of values.
b. A change in accounting policy should be disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements. However, the change should also be accounted for in a retrospective
fashion, where prior years’ results are restated to show the effect of the change on

Chapter 3 Solutions

449

those years. This retrospective treatment may result in a change in the effect on the
current year’s income. This treatment is necessary to maintain comparability with
prior years’ results.
c. Prepayments from customers appear to meet the definition of a liability, as they
represent a present obligation to deliver future resources to the customers (in this
case, products to be manufactured). The recognition criteria also appear to have
been met, so these amounts should be disclosed as liabilities. It is generally not
appropriate to net assets and liabilities together, as this distorts the underlying
nature of the individual financial statement elements.
d. It is unlikely that this even meets the definition of an asset, as it cannot be said that
we control the resource. Although we pay the research and development director’s
salary and likely have proprietary rights to his inventions, we cannot really say that
the resource, his knowledge, is controlled by the company. Even if we stretch
the definition of an asset here to include this knowledge, it still doesn’t meet the
recognition criteria, as there is no demonstration that the future flow of economic
resources is either probable or measurable.
e. The vice-president finance is indicating that year-end accounting adjustments need
to be considered for their effects on the debt-to-equity ratio. All of the accounting
treatments proposed by the vice-president finance would improve this ratio. However, all of the proposed accounting treatments are likely unsupportable under the
conceptual framework. It appears that the vice-president finance’s objectivity may
have been impaired by his requirement to prevent a debt covenant violation. It
is likely that the vice-president finance’s proposed accounting treatments will be
challenged by the company’s external auditors, which may create delays and other
problems in issuing the financial statements. This could also cause problems with
the bank. In performing my duties as the financial controller, I need to be aware of
the threats to my objectivity. Although there is no evidence of any ethical conflict yet,
I will need to perform my duties with integrity. If my actions do result in a conflict with
the vice-president finance, I will need to carefully consider my actions. I may need
to seek outside advice from my professional association and others, if necessary.
Ultimately, I must ensure that I do not prepare financial statements that are false or
misleading in any way.

Quality of Earnings: In terms of earnings quality, there are issues. The company’s
net income includes a significant gain on sale of idle assets, which means that a sizeable
portion of earnings were not generated from ongoing core business activities. Wozzie also
changed their inventory policy from FIFO to weighted average, which is contrary to the
method used within their industry sector. This is cause for concern as it raises questions
about whether management is purposely trying to manipulate income. A change in
accounting policy is only allowed as a result of changes in a primary source of GAAP
or may be applied voluntarily by management to enhance the relevance and reliability
of information contained in the financial statements for IFRS. Unless Wozzie’s inventory
pricing is better reflected by the weighted average method, contrary to the other companies in their industry sector, the measurement of inventory and cost of goods sold may be
biased.
Investing in the Company: Investors and analysts will review the financial statements
and see that part of the company’s net income results from a significant gain generated
from non-core business activities (the sale of idle assets) and will also detect the lower
cost of goods sold resulting from the change in inventory pricing policy disclosed in
the notes to the financial statements. As a result, investors will assess the earnings
reported as lower quality, and the capital markets will discount the earnings reported
to compensate for the biased information. Had Wozzie not fully disclosed the accounting
policy change for inventory, the market may have taken a bit longer to discount that portion
of the company’s net income due to lower quality information.

Eastern Cycles’ sale of the corporate-owned stores to a franchisee would not qualify for
discontinued operations treatment because the corporate-owned stores are not a separate major line of business. Under IFRS, a component of an entity comprises operations,
cash flows, and financial elements that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the
enterprise, which is not the case as stated in the question information.
Under ASPE, selling the corporate-owned stores would also not qualify for discontinued
operations treatment. The corporate-owned stores are likely a component of the company, but the franchisor is still involved with the franchisees because Eastern Cycles
continues to provide product to them as well as advertising, training, and support. The
cash flows of Eastern Cycles (the franchisor) are still affected by those of the franchisee
since Eastern Cycles collects monthly fees based on revenues.

e. Items are to be reported as Other Revenue and Expenses when using the multiplestep format for the statement of income. These are revenues, expenses, gains, and
losses that are not realized or incurred as part of ongoing operations (for a retail

Chapter 3 Solutions

459

business in this case). Examples of items that do not normally recur in a retail
business are:
• Dividend revenue (from investments)
• Gain or loss on sale or disposal of current or long-term assets (i.e., investments,
property, plant, equipment, and certain intangible assets such as patents and
copyrights)
• Interest income or expense from receivables or investments
• Impairment losses on various assets not recorded through OCI
• Loss from fire, flood, and storm damages in areas not known for this activity
• Loss on inventory due to decline in NRV
• Rent revenue or other revenues not normally associated with the usual business of the company
• Unrealized gains or losses on investments not recorded to OCI
Note that as a rule, if the item is unusual and material, (consider size, nature, and
frequency), the item is presented separately but included in income from continuing operations. If the item is unusual but immaterial, the item is combined with
other items in income from continuing operations. So, there is a trade-off between
additional disclosures of relevant information and too much disclosure resulting
in information overload. Moreover, IFRS and ASPE reporting requirements vary
and the standards change over time, so different items may need to be separately
reported in one standard but not necessarily in the other standard. It is important
to check the standards periodically to ensure that the latest reporting requirements
are known.

b. Liquidity ratios:

Current ratio = 1,608,000 ÷ 923,000 = 1.74
Quick ratio = (143,000 + 135,000 + 320,000 = 598,000) ÷ 923,000 = 0.65
Activity ratios:

Chapter 4 Solutions

467

Accounts receivable turnover = 3,000,000 ÷ 320,000
= 9.38 times per year or every 38.9 days (365 ÷ 9.38)
Days’ sales uncollected = 332,000 ÷ 3,000,000 × 365
= 40.4 days
Inventory turnover = (3,000,000 × 60%) ÷ 980,000
= 1.84 times per year or every 198.4 days (365 ÷ 1.84)
Asset turnover = 3,000,000 ÷ 4,449,000
= 0.67 times
Comments:
In terms of liquidity, Aztec’s current ratio of 1.74 suggests at first glance that it can
meet its short-term obligations. However, when inventory and prepaid expenses are
removed, the ratio drops to .65, which is short of the general rule of 1:1 for quick
ratios. This may mean that inventory levels are too high. The inventory turnover
ratio below will confirm if this is the case or not.
Activity ratios, such as the accounts receivable turnover, measure how quickly accounts are converted into cash. For Aztec, accounts receivable are collected every
38.9 days on average. Looking at days’ sales uncollected, if a guideline of 30–40
days to collect is considered reasonable, then Aztec is close to the top end of the 40day benchmark. Management would be wise to take steps to improve its receivables
collections somewhat.
Inventory turnover of every 200 days or so appears to be very low, which could
mean that too much cash is being tied up in inventory or there is too much obsolete
inventory that cannot be sold. A turnover ratio that is too high can signal inventory
shortages that may result in lost sales. A turnover ratio for each major inventory
category will help to determine if the situation is wide-spread or limited to a particular
inventory category.
Asset turnover for .67 times appears low but without industry standard ratios to use
as a comparison benchmark, ratios become less meaningful.

Net income = (4,858,000 + 40,000 + 102,000 − 3,050,000 − 11,000 − 8,500 −
135,000 − 1,190,000 − 580,000) = $25,500
b.
Debt ratio = 1,810,559 ÷ 2,702,000 = 67.01%
Equity ratio = 891,441 ÷ 2,702,000 = 32.99%
Nearly 70% of all assets are provided by creditors, which is significant. Digging
deeper and looking at the current ratio for 1.72 (1,002,000 ÷ 583,000), it appears
that the current assets will adequately cover the current liabilities. It follows that
the $1.2M in long-term obligations is the true risk for this company. The company
may have to re-finance the note payable when comes due in 3 more years, or sell
off any assets not currently contributing to profit. Selling off long-term assets is
a reasonable step provided that the assets are idle and will not be used in the
foreseeable future to earn profits. This company’s debt ratio is high, so it has very
little financial flexibility.
c. The credit balances in accounts receivable represent amounts owing to specific
customers. IFRS requires that significant credit balances be separated and reported
as a current liability.
Current ratio without separation of the credit 1,002,000 ÷ 583,000 = 1.72
Current ratio with separation of the credit (1,002,000+250,000)÷(583,000+
250,000) = 1.50
Managers may not be aware of the impact that the reporting requirement (to classify
credit receivables as current liabilities) can have on the current ratio. In this case, this
ratio has weakened significantly once the credit amount of $250,000 is reclassified
from a current asset to a current liability. If the company had a restrictive covenant
to maintain a current ratio of 1.7 times, this could spell disaster for the company
in two ways. First, creditors expect a restrictive covenant ratio to be maintained at
all times. If this ratio slips below that threshold, any short-term notes owing to the
creditor would become payable immediately as a demand loan. This would create
significant pressure to raise enough cash in a short period of time to make the single,
large payment. Second, if the debt owing to that creditor also includes any long-term
debt, the creditor could also force the company to reclassify the long-term balances
to current liabilities, driving the current ratio even lower. This might be all that it
takes to drive a marginally performing company into bankruptcy, which is a no-win
for either the company or its creditors.
The following are possible conditions or situations that would give rise to a credit
balance in accounts receivable customer accounts.
• Customers returned goods after the account was paid.
• A customer has overpaid an account in error.

470

Solutions To Exercises

• The company policy may be no cash refunds. Any returns would therefore be
credited to the customer account to be used later for a future purchase.
• Most of the accounting software applications apply customer prepayments (unearned revenues) as a credit balance in accounts receivable, since eventually
the actual amounts when owed by the customer at the time the goods and
services provided will be debited to the accounts receivable sub-ledger when
the invoice is prepared.
• On the basis of materiality, the credit balances, if insignificant, will likely remain
with the existing accounts receivable as small credit balances.

An analysis of Carmel’s free cash flow indicates it is negative as shown above.
Including dividends paid is optional, but it would not have made a difference in this
case. What does make the difference in this case is that the capital expenditures are

476

Solutions To Exercises

those needed to sustain the current level of operations. In Carmel’s case, the land
was purchased for investment purposes and not to meet operational requirements.
The free cash flow would more accurately be:
Net cash from operating activities
Capital purchases
Cash paid dividends
Free cash flow

$

181,600
0
(8,000)
173,600

This makes intuitive sense and is supported by the results from one of the coverage
ratios.
The current cash debt coverage provides information about how well Carmel can
cover its current liabilities from its net cash flows from operations:
Net cash from operating activities
Average current liabilities
Carmel’s current cash debt coverage is ($181,600 ÷ ((87,200 + 176,000) × 50%) =
1.38. The company has adequate cash flows to cover its current liabilities as they
come due and so overall, its financial flexibility looks positive.
In terms of cash flow patterns, Carmel has managed to more than triple its cash
balance in the year mainly from cash generated from operating activities, which
is a good trend. Carmel was able to pay $8,000 in dividends, or a 1.7% return.
If dividends are paid several times throughout the year, the return is more than
adequate to investors. Carmel also sold off its traded investments for a profit and
some idle buildings at a small loss to obtain sufficient internal funding for some land
that it wants as an investment. Carmel also managed to lower its accounts payable
levels by close to 60%. All this supports the assessment that Carmel’s financial
flexibility looks reasonable.
d. The information reported in the statement of cash flows is useful for assessing the
amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. The statement identifies the
specific cash inflows and outflows from operating activities, investing activities, and
financing activities. This gives stakeholders a better understanding of the liquidity
and financial flexibility of the enterprise. Some stakeholders have concerns about
the quality of the earnings because of the various bases that can be used to record
accruals and estimates, which can vary widely and be subjective. As a result, the
higher the ratio of cash provided by operating activities to net income, the more
stakeholders can rely on the earnings reported.

b. Negative cash flows from operating activities may signal trouble ahead with regard to
Egglestone’s daily operations, including profitability of operations and management
of its current assets such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable.
All three of these increased the cash outflows over the year. In fact, net cash

Chapter 5 Solutions

479

provided by investing activities funded the net cash used by both operating and
financing activities. Specifically, proceeds from sale of equipment and land were
used to fund operating and financing activities, which may be cause for concern if
the assets sold were used to generate significant revenue. Shareholders did receive
cash dividends, but investors may wonder if these payments will be sustainable over
the long term. Consider that dividends declared was $20,500, which was quite
high compared to the net income for $24,700. In addition, the dividends payable
account still had a balance payable for $41,600 from prior dividend declarations not
yet paid. All this adds up to increasing the pressure on the company to find enough
funds to catch up with the cash payments to investors. Egglestone may not be able
to sustain payment of cash dividends of this size in the long term if improvement
regarding its profitability and management of receivables, payables and inventory
are not implemented quickly.

b. The implied interest rate on accounts receivable paid to Busy Beaver from Heintoch
within the 15-day discount period = 1%÷[(30−15)÷365] = 24.33%. This means that
Heintoch would be using funds from the bank at a lower rate of 8% to save 24.33%
interest on early payment of amounts owing to Busy Beaver. It is worthwhile to take
advantage of the early payment discount terms in this case.

b. Accounts receivable balance per ledger of $85,000 is less than estimated accounts
receivable of $133,500, suggesting that some accounts receivable collections may
have been received but not actually deposited to the company’s bank account.
Controls to help prevent theft include proper segregation of duties among the person
initially in receipt of the cheque, the person depositing it, and the person recording
the collection. Customers should be encouraged to pay by cheque so an audit trail is
maintained. A timely completion of the monthly bank reconciliation would help detect
if any cash was recorded as collected, but not actually deposited to the company’s
bank account.

b. An unadjusted debit balance in the AFDA at year-end is usually the result of writeoffs during the year exceeding the total AFDA opening credit balance. The purpose
of the AFDA is to ensure that the net accounts receivable is valued at net realizable
value on the balance sheet.

c. The direct write-off approach is not in compliance with GAAP unless the amount of
the write-off is immaterial. Direct write-off does not match (bad debt) expense with
revenues of the period, nor does it result in receivables being stated at estimated
net realizable value on the balance sheet.

d. To be recorded as a sale under IFRS, both of the following conditions must be met:
i. The transferred assets risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred
to the transferee. This is evidenced by transferring the rights to receive the
cash flows from the receivables. Where the transferor continues to receive the
cash flows, there must be a contractual obligation to pay these cash flows to
the transferee without material delay.
ii. The transferee has obtained the right to pledge or to sell the transferred assets
to an unrelated party (concept of control).
To be recorded as a sale under ASPE, the control over the receivables has been
surrendered as evidenced by all of the following three conditions being met:
i. The transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor.

ii. The transferee has obtained the right to pledge or to sell the transferred assets.
iii. The transferor does not maintain effective control of the transferred assets
through a repurchase agreement.
e. Management would likely prefer the receivables transfer transaction to be treated
as a sale and derecognized from the accounts rather than a secured borrowing
because the company would not have to record and report the additional debt in the
SFP.

b. Factoring the accounts receivable will improve the accounts receivable turnover ratio
immediately after recording the entry on February 1 because the average accounts
receivable amount in the denominator will decrease, making the ratio larger. For
example, if sales were $3.2M and accounts receivable before the sale was $1.8M,
the turnover ratio would be 1.78 (3.2M ÷ 1.8M) compared to 3.2 (3.2M ÷ 1M). If the
calculation is made at the December 31 fiscal year-end, the balances of sales and

Chapter 6 Solutions

average accounts receivable would no longer be affected by this transaction, and
the accounts receivable turnover ratio would not be affected. This is because time
has passed and many of the accounts would have been collected by year-end, had
the company not sold them to a factor.

* See schedule above for the reduction in the principal amount after the first payment was made for
$12,000.

c. From the perspective of Brew It Again, an instalment note reduces the risk of noncollection when compared to a non-interest-bearing note. In the case of the noninterest-bearing note, the full amount is due at the maturity of the note. The instalment note provides a regular reduction of the principal balance in every payment
received annually. This is demonstrated in the effective interest table illustrated
above for the instalment note.

a.
Net Credit Sales
Average Trade Receivables (net)
$1,022,020*
(Using credit sales) =
($123,000 + $281,760**) ÷ 2
= 5.05 times or about 72 days

Accounts Receivable Turnover =

* $1,865,000 × 54.8% = 1,022,020
** Opening balance $123,000 + 1,022,020 − 863,260 = 281,760 closing balance.
Note that the write-off of $12,500 does not affect net accounts receivable.
The average receivable is therefore about 72 days old (365 ÷ 5.05).
b. Credit sales are a better measure in the calculation of accounts receivable turnover
ratio since cash sales do not affect accounts receivable balances. On this basis,
Corvid Company’s accounts receivable turnover ratio has declined from the previous
year. The average number of days to collect the accounts was 62 days (365 ÷
5.85) compared to 72 days for 2015. This could be an unfavourable trend for future
liquidity, if customers continue to pay slowly. Corvid may want to consider offering
discounts for early payments of accounts or tighten their credit policy.
It should be noted that credit sales are not always available when performing analysis and calculating the accounts receivables turnover ratio. When not available, the
figure of net sales should be used. As long as the calculation is done consistently
between years, or between businesses, the comparison will remain relevant.

EXERCISE 7–1
Inventory would normally include the following items:

Chapter 7 Solutions

503

• Salaries of assembly line workers
• Raw materials
• Salary of factory foreman
• Heating cost for the factory
• Miscellaneous supplies used in production process
• Costs to ship raw materials from the supplier to the factory
• Electricity cost for the factory
• Depreciation of factory machines
• Property taxes on factory building
• Discounts for early payment of raw material purchases
• Salaries of the factory’s janitorial staff

All of these costs can be considered either direct costs or attributable overhead costs.
The CEO’s and sales team salaries would not be considered costs directly attributable to
the purchase and conversion of inventory.

a. The company would allocate $150,000 of overhead at the rate of $150,000 ÷ 105,000
= $1.4286 per unit. As a practical matter, the company may choose to simply
allocate based on the standard rate of $1.50 per unit and record a small overhead
recovery through cost of sales. This would be reasonable as the volume produced
is close to the standard volume used to determine the rate.

Solutions To Exercises

b. The company would allocate $45,000 of overhead, using the standard rate of $1.50
per unit. The remaining overhead would need to be expensed. This is necessary to
avoid over-valuing the inventory.
c. The company would allocate $150,000 of overhead at the rate of $150,000 ÷ 160,000
= $0.9375 per unit. The standard rate cannot be used here, as it would over-absorb
the overhead cost into inventory.

Solutions To Exercises

2015: 3,058 ÷ 20,722 = 14.76%
2014: 2,831 ÷ 13,972 = 20.26%
The company’s sales increased significantly between 2014 and 2015. This appears to be
a positive result. The company’s gross profit also increased. However, the gross profit
margin decreased by 5.5%, which represents potential loss profits of approximately $1.1
billion on the current sales volume. To investigate further, one should look at budgets
and other management plans, as well as industry averages and competitor information.
It would also be useful to look at longer trends to see if this decline in profitability is
unique to this year or the sign of a longer term trend. Management explanations of the
declining margin percentage, contained in the annual report, should also be evaluated to
determine if the causes relate to slashing sales prices to increase volumes, increasing
cost structures, or some combination of the two. Other macroeconomic data may also be
useful in explaining the change.
Inventory Turnover Period, by year:

2015: [(2,982 + 1,564) ÷ 2 ÷ 17,164] × 365 = 48.34 days
2014: [(1,564 + 1,239) ÷ 2 ÷ 11,141] × 365 = 45.91 days
Inventory turnover has slowed from the previous year, indicating that goods are being
held longer. This is also indicated by the build up of inventory over the three year period.
Although the increased inventory may be reasonable as sales increase, the increase in
the turnover period could create cash flow problems if the trend continues. Again, other
comparative data is needed, such as budgets and industry averages, to evaluate the
meaning of this result.

d. Total interest income is $9,477 − 941 − 938 = $7,598 after holding the investment
for eight out of ten years.
Total net cash flows for Smythe is (25,523) cash paid + ($1,000 × 8 years) + 25,250
cash received upon sale = $7,727 over the life of the investment.
The difference of $129.48 (7,597.52−7,727) is the gain on the sale of the investment
of $130 at the end of eight years. (The small difference is due to rounding.)
e. If Smythe followed ASPE, then the investment would be accounted for using amortized cost. However, in this case, there would be a choice regarding the method
used to amortize the bond premium of $523 calculated in part (b). The choices are
straight-line amortization over the bond’s life or the effective interest rate method
shown in part (c). If the straight-line method was used, then the yearly amortization
amount would have been $523 ÷ 10 years or $52.30 per year for 8 years until the
bonds were sold in 2023. The interest income would be the same over the 8 years.

Solutions To Exercises

The market value of an existing bond will fluctuate with changes in the market
interest rates and with changes in the financial condition of the corporation that
issued the bond. For example, a 9% bond will become more valuable if market
interest rates decrease to 8% because the interest payment is at a higher rate than
what investors would receive if they invested in a market that yielded only 8%.
In this case, the issued bond promises to pay 4% interest for the next 10 years in a
marketplace where interest has now risen to 5.5% for bonds with similar characteristics and risks. This bond will now become less valuable because the market interest
rate has risen, and investors would receive a higher return in the market than with
the 4% bond. When the financial condition of the issuing corporation deteriorates,
the market value of the bond is likely to decline as well.

c. If Imperial Mark follows ASPE, it would classify the investment in bonds as ShortTerm Trading Investments, FVNI, and report it as a current investment since management intends to sell it. The alternate method to amortize the premium is using
straight-line method. The premium to amortize is the face value minus the investment cost over the life of the bond or (20,000 − 20,200) = 200 ÷ 112 months =

a. Halberton would classify this as an investment in shares – FVOCI equities, without
recycling, which is a special irrevocable election. Even though it may be for sale,
there is no specific intention as to exactly when it will be sold, so it does not fit the
business model for shares that are being actively traded. The investment will be
reported as a long-term asset because it is unknown when it will be sold.

The drop in price is not due to investment impairments, it is due to market fluctuations. For this reason, it is a fair value adjustment through OCI. Had the credit
risk for this investment increased due to increased expected defaults, management
would have revised the ECL and adjusted the investment and loss accounts (to net
income due to impairment) accordingly.

d. If Halberton followed ASPE, this investment would likely be classified as a shortterm trading investment with fair value adjustments at each reporting date, since
the investment for shares appears to have active market prices and the investment
is for sale (though no specific intention to sell exists at the moment). If the shares
were not publicly traded, then the investment would likely be classified as an Other
Investment – at cost, with no fair value adjustments.

NOTE – An alternative treatment is to debit interest income at the date of purchase of
the bonds instead of interest receivable. This procedure is correct, assuming that when
the cash is received for the interest, an appropriate credit to interest income is recorded.
Consistency is key.

c. ASPE requires separate reporting of interest income from net gains or losses recognized on financial instruments (CPA Canada Handbook, Part II, Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises, Section 3856.52) whereas IFRS can choose to disclose whether the net gains or losses on financial assets measured at fair value and
reported on the income statement include interest and gains or losses, but it is not
mandatory. (For purposes of this text, the preferred treatment for either standard is
to separate unrealized gains/loss, interest income and dividend income separately
since some of the information is required when completing the corporate tax returns
for either ASPE or IFRS companies.)
d. The overall returns generated from the bond investment was $10,050, calculated as
follows:
Interest Oct 31, 2014
Interest accrued Dec 31, 2014

This return represents a 10.72% annual return on the investment [($10,050÷5 months×
12) ÷ $225,000]. This return is more than anything the company might be able to
earn in a typical savings account.

b. Part (a) uses a fair values to measures for FVNI investments and are re-measured
to their FV at each year-end. No, separate impairment measurement if required
because they are already at their fair values. If Helsinky had accounted for this
investment at amortized cost, the impairment model would change to an incurred
loss model. When there is objective evidence that the expected future cash flows
have been significantly reduced, an impairment loss is measured and recognized as
follows:
The loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount
and higher of the present value of the revised expected cash flows, discounted at the current market discount rate and the estimated net realizable value of the investment.
The impairment losses can be reversed if the investment values increase.

Solutions To Exercises

c. For in investment in equities classified as FVOCI, there are no impairment evaluations required because the investment is remeasured to its fair value each reporting
date and the gains/losses upon sale are reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings.
Had the investment been a debt investment and classified as FVOCI, such as bonds,
an impairment evaluation would be required initially upon acquisition and based on
either a 12-month or lifetime ECL valuation. This is because the gains/losses are
recycled through net income upon sale. Any impairment loss would be immediately
recorded to net income in this case and not to OCI.

a. Investee’s total net income = $60,000 ÷ 30% = $200,000
b. Investee’s total dividend payout = $200,000 × 15% = $30,000
c. Investor’s share of net income = $200,000 × 30% = $60,000
d. Investor’s annual depreciation of the excess payment for net capital assets is the
only other credit amount recorded in the T-account for $1,500
e. Goodwill = $900,000 × 30% = 270,000 − 290,000 = 20,000 − (1,500 × 10 years) =

b. Recall that comprehensive income is:
Net income + Other Comprehensive Income (i.e., unrealized fair value gains/losses
from FVOCI investments) = Comprehensive Income
With this in mind, comprehensive income will be the same amount as net income
because there is no Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) amount to report as the
investment is classified as FVNI with unrealized gains and losses due to fair value
adjustments being recorded to net income. Had the investment been classified as
FVOCI, then the $20,000 fair value change would have been reported as OCI and
not in net income, thus increasing comprehensive income by $20,000 more than net
income in 2014, and by $40,000 in 2015.

The recoverable tax should be disclosed as an amount receivable on the balance sheet.
The repair costs, costs of training employees, overhead costs, and insurance cost would
all be expensed as regular operating expenses on the income statement.
An alternative treatment for the government grant would be to defer it as an unearned
revenue liability and then amortize it on the same basis as the equipment depreciation.

Transaction 1:
IFRS requires assets acquired in exchange for the company’s shares to be reported at
the fair value of the asset acquired. The list price is not relevant, as the salesman has
already indicated that this can be negotiated downward. If the $80,000 negotiated price
is considered a reliable representation of the fair value of the asset, this amount should
be used:

If the $80,000 price is not considered a reliable fair value, then the fair value of the shares
given up ($78,750) should be used, as the shares are actively traded.
Transaction 2:
The asset acquired by issuing a non-interest bearing note needs to be reported at its fair
value. As the interest rate of zero is not reasonable, based on market conditions, the
payments for the asset need to be adjusted to their present value to properly reflect the
current fair value of the asset.

c. The deferral method will result in annual depreciation expense of $625,000 ÷ 30
years = $20,833, with an offsetting annual grant income amount recognized = $90,000
÷ 30 years = $ 3,000 per year.
The offset method will result in an annual depreciation expense of $535,000 ÷ 30

The asset is no longer impaired. However, the reversal of the impairment loss is
limited. If the impairment had never occurred, the carrying value of the asset would
have been:
Unimpaired carrying value on Jan 1, 2016

Solutions To Exercises

EXERCISE 10–6
a.
b. ASPE 3063 uses a two-step process for determining impairment losses. The first
step is to determine if the asset is impaired by comparing the undiscounted future
cash flows to the carrying value:
Undiscounted future cash flows: $140,000
Carrying value
$150,000
Therefore, the asset is impaired.
The second step is to determine the amount of the impairment. This amount is the
difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset:
Carrying value
Fair value
Impairment loss

$150,000
$125,000
$ 25,000

d. The carrying value is now $125,000 − $41,667 = $83,333. As this is less than the
undiscounted future cash flows, the asset is no longer impaired. However, under
ASPE 3063, reversals of impairment losses are not allowed, so no adjustment can
be made in this case.

a. The total carrying value of the division is $95,000. The fair values of the individual
assets cannot be determined, so the value in use is the appropriate measure. In this
case, the value in use is $80,000, which means the division is impaired by $15,000.

c. The value in use ($80,000) is greater than the fair value less costs to sell ($60,000)
so the calculation of impairment loss is the same as in part (a) (i.e., $15,000).
However, none of the impairment loss should be allocated to the computers, as
their carrying value ($55,000) is less than their recoverable amount ($60,000). The
impairment loss would therefore be allocated as follows:

EXERCISE 11–2

a. Intangible assets likely include:
• purchased trademark Aromatica Organica and its related internet domain name
• purchased patented soap recipes
• expenditures related to infrastructure and graphical design development of Harman’s unique website through which the retailers review the product offerings
and place their orders.
b. The majority of Harman’s assets are intangible. They include the Aromatica Organica trademark, the patented soap and oil recipes, and the company’s own product
and ordering website. The intangible assets help to protect the revenues from
competitor companies, so Harman can sell a unique product with a specific brand
name that customers recognize for its fine quality and through a unique website
developed by Harman.
c. The intangible assets meet the definition of an asset because they involve past and
present economic resources for which there are probable future economic benefits
that are obtained and controlled by Harman. Recording intangible assets on the
company’s SFP/BS provides users with relevant and faithfully representative information about the company’s expected future economic benefits, as well as financial
statements that are complete and free from error or bias.

* September 1 was the date that the patent was legally upheld thus meeting the definition
of an asset subject to amortization. There are 4 months remaining in 2015 starting
September 1. If on January 1, 2015 there were 14 years remaining, then as at September
1, 2015, there would be 13 years + 4 months remaining. Converting this to months is
13 × 12 = 156 months + 4 months = 160 months. For 2015, there are 4 months to yearend to amortize the legal fees, so 4 ÷ 160 months would be the prorated amount of the
legal fees capitalized for 2015.
Carrying amount as at Dec 31, 2015: 330,000 − 21,621 = $308,379
The accounting for the research expense of $140,000 is to be expensed when incurred
because it can only be recognized from the development phase of an internal project
when the six criteria for capitalization are met.

a. Under ASPE, Trembeld has the option either to expense all costs as incurred or
to recognize the costs as an internally generated intangible asset when the six
development phase criteria for capitalization are met. If Trembeld expenses all costs
as incurred, they will be expensed as research and development expenses.

If Trembeld chooses, it can capitalize all costs incurred after April 1. The costs
incurred prior to April 1 must be expensed as research and development expenses.

* $270,000 + 86,000 + 25,400 + 8,600 = $390,000

Note: Under ASPE, once interest costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or development of an intangible asset meet the six criteria to be capitalized, they may be capitalized or expensed depending on the company’s accounting
policy for borrowing costs.
b. If Trembeld followed IFRS, all costs associated with the development of internally
generated intangible assets would be capitalized when the six development phase
criteria for capitalization are met. The costs incurred prior to the date the required
criteria were met would be expensed as research and development expense.

EXERCISE 11–6
a. Under ASPE
Recoverability test:
The undiscounted future cash flows of $152,000 < the carrying amount $100,500,
therefore the asset is impaired.
The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount $100,500 and fair value $55,000.
In this case, the undiscounted future cash flows ($152,000) > Carrying amount
($100,500), therefore the asset is not impaired.
b. Under IFRS
If carrying amount $100,500 > recoverable amount $115,000 (where recoverable
amount is the higher of value in use $115,000 and fair value less costs to sell
$50,000), the asset is impaired.
The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between carrying amount $100,500
and recoverable amount $115,000.
In this case, the carrying amount $100,500 is < the recoverable amount of $115,000
so there is no impairment loss.

c. Under ASPE, for indefinite-life intangible assets:
If the carrying amount $100,500 > the asset’s fair value $55,000, then the asset is
impaired.
The impairment loss is calculated as $45,500 ($100,500 − $55,000).
Under IFRS, there is no impairment loss as the carrying amount of $100,500 < the
recoverable amount of $115,000 (where recoverable amount is the higher of value
in use and fair value less costs to sell).

Solutions To Exercises

* Amortization 2012 to 2014: $800,000 ÷ 8 × 3 years = $300,000

Amortization for 2015:
(Remaining carrying value − revised residual value)
Remaining useful life
(800,000 − 300,000) − 0 residual value
= 125,000
(7 − 3)
Accumulated amortization 2012 to 2015: (300,000 + 125,000) = $425,000
b. The amount of amortization of the franchise for the year ended December 31, 2014,
is $25,000: ($500,000 ÷ 20 years). Reason: Bartek should amortize the franchise
over 20 years which is the period of the identifiable cash flows. Even though the
franchise is considered as “perpetual,” the company believes it will generate future
economic benefits for only the next 20 years.
c. Unamortized development costs would be reported as $50,000 ($250,000 net of
$200,000 accumulated amortization) at December 31, 2015 on the SFP/BS.
Amortization for 2012 to 2015: $250,000 ÷ 5 years × 4 years = $200,000

b. Under IFRS, the recoverable amount of the CGU of $1,850,000 (which is the greater
of the fair value, less costs to sell $1,600,000, and the value in use $1,850,000) is
compared with its carrying amount $1,925,000 to determine if there is any impairment.
The goodwill is impaired because carrying amount of the CGU $1,925,000 > recoverable amount of the CGU $1,850,000. The goodwill impairment loss is $75,000
($1,925,000 − $1,850,000). A reversal of an impairment loss on goodwill is not
permitted.

Chapter 11 Solutions

c. Under ASPE, goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
impairment may exist. An impairment exists if the carrying amount of the reporting
unit $1,925,000 exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit $1,860,000. In this case
there is an impairment loss of $65,000 ($1,925,000 − $1,860,000). A reversal of an
impairment loss on goodwill is not permitted.

EXERCISE 11–11

a. The determination of useful life by management can have a material effect on the

Solutions To Exercises

balance sheet as well as on the income statement. The following are the variables
to consider when determining the appropriate useful life for a limited-life intangible.
• The legal life for a patent in Canada is twenty years but management can deem
a shorter useful life based on
– the expected use of the patent
– economic factors such as demand and competition
– the period over which its benefits are expected to be provided.
• The estimated useful life of the patent should be based on neutral and unbiased
consideration of the factors above, which requires a degree of professional
judgment.
b. December 31, 2014:
Amortization: $25,000 ÷ 20 = $1,250
Carrying amount: $25,000 − $1,250 = $23,750
December 31, 2015:
Amortization: $1,250 + ($35,000 ÷ 18.5 × (6 ÷ 12)) = $2,196 (rounded)
Carrying amount: $23,750 + $35,000 − $2,196 = $56,554
c. Dec 31, 2014 carrying amount from (b): $23,750
2015 amortization: ($23,750 ÷(15 −1)) + ($35,000 ÷(15 −1.5)) ×(6 ÷12) = $2,993
(rounded)
Carrying amount: $23,750 + $35,000 − $2,993 = $55,757
d. If it has an indefinite life, then do not amortize. If classified as indefinite life, management must review useful life annually to ensure that conditions and circumstances
continue to support the indefinite life assessment. Any change in useful life is to
be accounted as a change in estimate, which is accounted for prospectively. Also,
management would have to test annually for impairment or whenever indicators of
such a possibility exist.

Note: The balance sheet reporting requirement is to disclose the net amount for
each intangible asset separately, its related accumulated amortization, any accumulated impairment losses, and a total for net intangible assets. With these requirements in mind, an alternative reporting format for the balance sheet would be
to report the net amounts for each intangible asset as shown in the right-hand column with disclosure of the accumulated amortization, any accumulated impairment
losses and the net amount for each intangible asset in an additional schedule in the
notes to the financial statements.
c. Under IFRS, if the costs meet the six development phase criteria for capitalization,
then they are to be capitalized. Under ASPE, costs that meet the six development
phase criteria for capitalization may either be capitalized or expensed, depending
on the entity’s accounting policy. In this case, Hilde’s policy is to capitalize costs
that meet the criteria; therefore, the accounting entries would be the same as the
solution above.

Under IFRS there is an option to use the revaluation model for subsequent measurement of intangible assets after acquisition if there is an active market for the
intangible assets. Refer to the chapter on property, plant, and equipment for details
about this model. In addition, under IFRS, an assessment of estimated useful life is
required at each reporting date.
d. Impairment testing for limited-life assets under ASPE:
Limited-life intangible assets would be tested for possible impairment whenever
events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
carrying amount of the asset is compared to undiscounted future net cash flows of
the asset, to determine if the asset is impaired. If impaired, the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and its fair value will be the impairment amount. Under
ASPE, an impairment loss for intangible assets may not be reversed.
Impairment testing for limited-life intangibles under IFRS:
At the end of each reporting period, the asset is to be assessed for possible impairment. If impairment is suspected, and the carrying amount is higher than the
recoverable amount (which is the higher of the value in use, and the fair value less
costs to sell), the asset is impaired. The impairment loss is the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and its recoverable amount. Under IFRS, an impairment
loss may be reversed in the future, although the reversal is limited to what the asset’s
carrying amount would have been had there been no impairment.

b. Under IFRS, costs associated with the development of internally generated intangible assets are capitalized when the six specific criteria for capitalization are met in
the development stage. The $250,000 must be expensed as it was incurred before
the future benefits were reasonably certain. Costs incurred after the six specific
criteria for capitalization are met, are capitalized. The $50,000 costs incurred indicates the company’s intention and ability to generate future economic benefits.
As a result, the $50,000 would be capitalized as development costs. The $50,000
capitalized costs would be amortized over periods benefiting after manufacturing
begins.

a. Impairment for limited-life under IFRS:

Carrying value: 1,000,000
Recoverable amount: higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell
= higher of [$1,100,000 and ($1,000,000 − 45,000 = 955,000)] = 1,100,000
Carrying value is less than 1,100,000, therefore the franchise is not impaired.
b. Carrying value: 1,000,000
Recoverable amount: 950,000
Carrying value is more than the recoverable amount therefore the franchise is impaired by $50,000.

c. Carrying value: 1,000,000
Recoverable amount: higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell
= higher of [$1,100,000 and ($1,350,000 − 45,000 = 1,305,000)] = 1,305,000
Carrying value is less than 1,305,000, therefore the franchise is not impaired.
d. Under IFRS, indefinite-life intangible assets are tested for impairment annually (even
if there is no indication of impairment), which is the same as was done for limited-life
intangible assets. So the answers in parts (a) to (c) will not change because the
franchise has an unlimited life.
e. Under ASPE for limited-life intangibles, if there is reason to suspect impairment, then
management can complete an assessment of the franchise. If the carrying value
is greater than the undiscounted cash flows then it is impaired. The impairment
amount is the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.
Part (a) Carrying value: 1,000,000
Undiscounted future cash flow = 1,200,000
Carrying value is less than 1,200,000, therefore the franchise is not impaired.
Part (b) Carrying value: 1,000,000
Recoverable amount (undiscounted future cash flows) = 950,000
Carrying value is more than the recoverable amount therefore the franchise is impaired by $50,000.

Part (c) Fair value changed to $1.35 million. Fair value is not relevant for ASPE to
assess recoverability, so the answer does not change from part (b).
f. Part (a) Under ASPE, indefinite-life intangible assets are tested for impairment when
circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired same as with limited-life
intangibles. However, the test differs from the test for limited-life assets. Here, a fair
value test is used, and an impairment loss is recorded when the carrying amount
exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset.
Carrying value: 1,000,000
Fair value: 1,000,000
Carrying value is equal to the fair value for 1,000,000; therefore, the franchise is not
impaired.
Part (b) Under ASPE, the recoverable amount refers to undiscounted future cash
flows, which does not affect the impairment test for indefinite-life intangible assets,
which compares the carrying value to the fair value of the asset. The fair value
remains at 1,000,000, therefore the asset is not impaired.
Part (c) Carrying value: 1,000,000
Fair value: 1,350,000
Carrying value is less than the fair value for 1,350,000, therefore the franchise is not
impaired under ASPE for an indefinite-life asset.

b. Payment of total consideration of $280,000 for Candelabra resulted in payment
for goodwill of $65,000. Goodwill is defined as an asset representing the future
economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination

that are not individually identified or separately recognized. In paying for goodwill of
$65,000, Boxlight may have considered the value of Candelabra’s established customers for repeat business, the company’s reputation, the competence and ability
of its management team to strategize effectively, its credit rating with its suppliers,
and whether the company has highly qualified and motivated employees. Together,
these could make the value of the business greater than the sum of the fair value of
its net identifiable assets.

Note: Had the impairment amount exceeded the $65,000 goodwill carrying value,
the amount of the difference would be allocated to the remaining net identifiable
assets on a prorated basis.
e. For part (c), reversal of goodwill if impairment losses exist is not permitted under
ASPE. For part (d), reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under
IFRS.
