Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) actively seeks opportunities to invest in organizations and
thought leaders that have a sincere interest in implementing fundamental changes that not only
yield immediate gains, but also repair broken systems for future generations. LJAF currently focuses
its strategic investments on education, criminal justice, research integrity, and public accountability.
The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has been making grants since 1967 to help solve social
and environmental problems at home and around the world. The Foundation concentrates its
resources on activities in education, the environment, global development and population,
performing arts, and philanthropy, and makes grants to support disadvantaged communities in the
San Francisco Bay Area.
Calvin K. Kazanjian was the founder and president of Peter Paul (Almond Joy), Inc. He firmly believed
that the more people understood about basic economics the happier and more prosperous they
would be. Accordingly, he established the Calvin K. Kazanjian Economics Foundation Inc, in 1949 as a
philanthropic, nonpolitical educational organization to support efforts that enhanced economic
understanding.
Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to
help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving
people’s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them the chance to lift
themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to significantly
improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based
in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr.,
under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Maxfield Foundation supports projects with potential for high impact in science, education,
sustainability, and other areas of social importance.

About Introductory Business Statistics
Introductory Business Statistics is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of the one-semester statistics
course for business, economics, and related majors. Core statistical concepts and skills have been augmented with practical
business examples, scenarios, and exercises. The result is a meaningful understanding of the discipline which will serve
students in their business careers and real-world experiences.

Coverage and scope
Introductory Business Statistics began as a customized version of OpenStax Introductory Statistics by Barbara Illowsky and
Susan Dean. Statistics faculty at The University of Oklahoma have used the business statistics adaptation for several years,
and the author has continually refined it based on student success and faculty feedback.
The book is structured in a similar manner to most traditional statistics textbooks. The most significant topical changes
occur in the latter chapters on regression analysis. Discrete probability density functions have been reordered to provide a
logical progression from simple counting formulas to more complex continuous distributions. Many additional homework
assignments have been added, as well as new, more mathematical examples.
Introductory Business Statistics places a significant emphasis on the development and practical application of formulas so
that students have a deeper understanding of their interpretation and application of data. To achieve this unique approach,
the author included a wealth of additional material and purposely de-emphasized the use of the scientific calculator. Specific
changes regarding formula use include:

Preface

• Expanded discussions of the combinatorial formulas, factorials, and sigma notation
• Adjustments to explanations of the acceptance/rejection rule for hypothesis testing, as well as a focus on terminology
regarding confidence intervals
• Deep reliance on statistical tables for the process of finding probabilities (which would not be required if probabilities
relied on scientific calculators)
• Continual and emphasized links to the Central Limit Theorem throughout the book; Introductory Business Statistics
consistently links each test statistic back to this fundamental theorem in inferential statistics
Another fundamental focus of the book is the link between statistical inference and the scientific method. Business and
economics models are fundamentally grounded in assumed relationships of cause and effect. They are developed to both
test hypotheses and to predict from such models. This comes from the belief that statistics is the gatekeeper that allows
some theories to remain and others to be cast aside for a new perspective of the world around us. This philosophical view is
presented in detail throughout and informs the method of presenting the regression model, in particular.
The correlation and regression chapter includes confidence intervals for predictions, alternative mathematical forms to allow
for testing categorical variables, and the presentation of the multiple regression model.

Pedagogical features
• Examples are placed strategically throughout the text to show students the step-by-step process of interpreting and
solving statistical problems. To keep the text relevant for students, the examples are drawn from a broad spectrum of
practical topics; these include examples about college life and learning, health and medicine, retail and business, and
sports and entertainment.
• Practice, Homework, and Bringing It Together give the students problems at various degrees of difficulty while
also including real-world scenarios to engage students.

Additional resources
Student and instructor resources
We’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an instructor
solution manual, and PowerPoint slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for
when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org. Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax
book.

Community Hubs
OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community
Hubs on OER Commons – a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books,
free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources to use
in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We
encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to
enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.

1 | SAMPLING AND DATA

Figure 1.1 We encounter statistics in our daily lives more often than we probably realize and from many different
sources, like the news. (credit: David Sim)

Introduction
You are probably asking yourself the question, "When and where will I use statistics?" If you read any newspaper, watch
television, or use the Internet, you will see statistical information. There are statistics about crime, sports, education,
politics, and real estate. Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given
sample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or "fact."
Statistical methods can help you make the "best educated guess."
Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques
for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen
profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and
early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.
Included in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics. You will soon understand that statistics
and probability work together. You will also learn how data are gathered and what "good" data can be distinguished from
"bad."

1.1 | Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms
The science of statistics deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. We see and use data in
our everyday lives.
In this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing data is called descriptive
statistics. Two ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average). After you
have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from "good"
data. The formal methods are called inferential statistics. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident
we can be that our conclusions are correct.
Effective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful examination
of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal
of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The
calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly
grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life.

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

Probability
Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring.
For example, if you toss a fair coin four times, the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However, if you toss
the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to half heads and half tails. The expected theoretical probability of
heads in any one toss is 1 or 0.5. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are uncertain, there is a regular pattern

2

of outcomes when there are many repetitions. After reading about the English statistician Karl Pearson who tossed a coin
24,000 times with a result of 12,012 heads, one of the authors tossed a coin 2,000 times. The results were 996 heads. The
fraction 996 is equal to 0.498 which is very close to 0.5, the expected probability.

2000

The theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as poker. Predictions take the form of probabilities.
To predict the likelihood of an earthquake, of rain, or whether you will get an A in this course, we use probabilities. Doctors
use probability to determine the chance of a vaccination causing the disease the vaccination is supposed to prevent. A
stockbroker uses probability to determine the rate of return on a client's investments. You might use probability to decide to
buy a lottery ticket or not. In your study of statistics, you will use the power of mathematics through probability calculations
to analyze and interpret your data.

Key Terms
In statistics, we generally want to study a population. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or
objects under study. To study the population, we select a sample. The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset)
of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of
sampling from a population.
Because it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you
wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who
attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students' grade point averages. In presidential elections,
opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people
in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16
ounces of carbonated drink.
From the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For
example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of
points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate
of a population parameter, in this case the mean. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that
can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points
earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.
One of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really
depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population
in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in
inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population
parameter.
A variable, or random variable, usually notated by capital letters such as X and Y, is a characteristic or measurement that
can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be numerical or categorical. Numerical variables
take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours. Categorical variables place the person or
thing into a category. If we let X equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then X is a
numerical variable. If we let Y be a person's party affiliation, then some examples of Y include Republican, Democrat, and
Independent. Y is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of X (calculate the average number of points
earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of Y (calculating an average party affiliation makes no
sense).
Data are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words. Datum is a single value.
Two words that come up often in statistics are mean and proportion. If you were to take three exams in your math classes
and obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by
three (your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40 students and 22 are men
and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is 22 and the proportion of women students is 18 . Mean and

40

proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters.

NOTE
The words " mean" and " average" are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is
common practice. The technical term is "arithmetic mean," and "average" is technically a center location. However, in
practice among non-statisticians, "average" is commonly accepted for "arithmetic mean."

Example 1.1
Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. We want to know the average (mean) amount
of money first year college students spend at ABC College on school supplies that do not include books. We
randomly surveyed 100 first year students at the college. Three of those students spent $150, $200, and $225,
respectively.
Solution 1.1
The population is all first year students attending ABC College this term.
The sample could be all students enrolled in one section of a beginning statistics course at ABC College (although
this sample may not represent the entire population).
The parameter is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding books) by first year college students at
ABC College this term: the population mean.
The statistic is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding books) by first year college students in the
sample.
The variable could be the amount of money spent (excluding books) by one first year student. Let X = the amount
of money spent (excluding books) by one first year student attending ABC College.
The data are the dollar amounts spent by the first year students. Examples of the data are $150, $200, and $225.

Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. We want to know the average (mean) amount of
money spent on school uniforms each year by families with children at Knoll Academy. We randomly survey 100
families with children in the school. Three of the families spent $65, $75, and $95, respectively.

Example 1.3
Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study.
As part of a study designed to test the safety of automobiles, the National Transportation Safety Board collected
and reviewed data about the effects of an automobile crash on test dummies. Here is the criterion they used:
Speed at which Cars Crashed Location of “drive” (i.e. dummies)
35 miles/hour

Front Seat

Table 1.1

Cars with dummies in the front seats were crashed into a wall at a speed of 35 miles per hour. We want to know
the proportion of dummies in the driver’s seat that would have had head injuries, if they had been actual drivers.
We start with a simple random sample of 75 cars.
Solution 1.3
The population is all cars containing dummies in the front seat.
The sample is the 75 cars, selected by a simple random sample.
The parameter is the proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real people) who would have suffered head
injuries in the population.
The statistic is proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real people) who would have suffered head injuries
in the sample.
The variable X = the number of driver dummies (if they had been real people) who would have suffered head
injuries.
The data are either: yes, had head injury, or no, did not.

Example 1.4
Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study.
An insurance company would like to determine the proportion of all medical doctors who have been involved in
one or more malpractice lawsuits. The company selects 500 doctors at random from a professional directory and
determines the number in the sample who have been involved in a malpractice lawsuit.
Solution 1.4
The population is all medical doctors listed in the professional directory.
The parameter is the proportion of medical doctors who have been involved in one or more malpractice suits in
the population.
The sample is the 500 doctors selected at random from the professional directory.
The statistic is the proportion of medical doctors who have been involved in one or more malpractice suits in the
sample.
The variable X = the number of medical doctors who have been involved in one or more malpractice suits.
The data are either: yes, was involved in one or more malpractice lawsuits, or no, was not.

values. Most data can be put into the following categories:
• Qualitative
• Quantitative
Qualitative data are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. Qualitative data are also often
called categorical data. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are
examples of qualitative(categorical) data. Qualitative(categorical) data are generally described by words or letters. For
instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+.
Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative(categorical) data because it lends itself more easily to
mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.
Quantitative data are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of counting or measuring attributes of a population.
Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are
examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either discrete or continuous.
All data that are the result of counting are called quantitative discrete data. These data take on only certain numerical
values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero, one,
two, or three.
Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are
called quantitative continuous data. Continuous data are often the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times.
A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or 11.0, would
be quantitative continuous data.

Example 1.5 Data Sample of Quantitative Discrete Data
The data are the number of books students carry in their backpacks. You sample five students. Two students carry
three books, one student carries four books, one student carries two books, and one student carries one book. The
numbers of books (three, four, two, and one) are the quantitative discrete data.

1.5 The data are the number of machines in a gym. You sample five gyms. One gym has 12 machines, one gym has
15 machines, one gym has ten machines, one gym has 22 machines, and the other gym has 20 machines. What type of
data is this?

Example 1.6 Data Sample of Quantitative Continuous Data
The data are the weights of backpacks with books in them. You sample the same five students. The weights (in
pounds) of their backpacks are 6.2, 7, 6.8, 9.1, 4.3. Notice that backpacks carrying three books can have different
weights. Weights are quantitative continuous data.

1.6

The data are the areas of lawns in square feet. You sample five houses. The areas of the lawns are 144 sq. feet,
160 sq. feet, 190 sq. feet, 180 sq. feet, and 210 sq. feet. What type of data is this?

10

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

Example 1.7
You go to the supermarket and purchase three cans of soup (19 ounces) tomato bisque, 14.1 ounces lentil, and 19
ounces Italian wedding), two packages of nuts (walnuts and peanuts), four different kinds of vegetable (broccoli,
cauliflower, spinach, and carrots), and two desserts (16 ounces pistachio ice cream and 32 ounces chocolate chip
cookies).
Name data sets that are quantitative discrete, quantitative continuous, and qualitative(categorical).
Solution 1.7
One Possible Solution:
• The three cans of soup, two packages of nuts, four kinds of vegetables and two desserts are quantitative
discrete data because you count them.
• The weights of the soups (19 ounces, 14.1 ounces, 19 ounces) are quantitative continuous data because you
measure weights as precisely as possible.
• Types of soups, nuts, vegetables and desserts are qualitative(categorical) data because they are categorical.
Try to identify additional data sets in this example.

Example 1.8
The data are the colors of backpacks. Again, you sample the same five students. One student has a red backpack,
two students have black backpacks, one student has a green backpack, and one student has a gray backpack. The
colors red, black, black, green, and gray are qualitative(categorical) data.

1.8 The data are the colors of houses. You sample five houses. The colors of the houses are white, yellow, white, red,
and white. What type of data is this?

NOTE
You may collect data as numbers and report it categorically. For example, the quiz scores for each student are recorded
throughout the term. At the end of the term, the quiz scores are reported as A, B, C, D, or F.

Example 1.9
Work collaboratively to determine the correct data type (quantitative or qualitative). Indicate whether quantitative
data are continuous or discrete. Hint: Data that are discrete often start with the words "the number of."
a. the number of pairs of shoes you own
b. the type of car you drive
c. the distance from your home to the nearest grocery store
d. the number of classes you take per school year
e. the type of calculator you use
f. weights of sumo wrestlers

g. number of correct answers on a quiz
h. IQ scores (This may cause some discussion.)
Solution 1.9
Items a, d, and g are quantitative discrete; items c, f, and h are quantitative continuous; items b and e are
qualitative, or categorical.

Determine the correct data type (quantitative or qualitative) for the number of cars in a parking lot. Indicate
whether quantitative data are continuous or discrete.

juniors, or seniors. The data she collects are summarized in the pie chart Figure 1.1. What type of data does this
graph show?

Qualitative Data Discussion
Below are tables comparing the number of part-time and full-time students at De Anza College and Foothill College
enrolled for the spring 2010 quarter. The tables display counts (frequencies) and percentages or proportions (relative
frequencies). The percent columns make comparing the same categories in the colleges easier. Displaying percentages along
with the numbers is often helpful, but it is particularly important when comparing sets of data that do not have the same
totals, such as the total enrollments for both colleges in this example. Notice how much larger the percentage for part-time
students at Foothill College is compared to De Anza College.

Table 1.2 Fall Term 2007 (Census day)

Tables are a good way of organizing and displaying data. But graphs can be even more helpful in understanding the data.
There are no strict rules concerning which graphs to use. Two graphs that are used to display qualitative(categorical) data
are pie charts and bar graphs.
In a pie chart, categories of data are represented by wedges in a circle and are proportional in size to the percent of
individuals in each category.
In a bar graph, the length of the bar for each category is proportional to the number or percent of individuals in each
category. Bars may be vertical or horizontal.
A Pareto chart consists of bars that are sorted into order by category size (largest to smallest).
Look at Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5 and determine which graph (pie or bar) you think displays the comparisons better.

It is a good idea to look at a variety of graphs to see which is the most helpful in displaying the data. We might make
different choices of what we think is the “best” graph depending on the data and the context. Our choice also depends on
what we are using the data for.

Percentages That Add to More (or Less) Than 100%
Sometimes percentages add up to be more than 100% (or less than 100%). In the graph, the percentages add to more than
100% because students can be in more than one category. A bar graph is appropriate to compare the relative size of the
categories. A pie chart cannot be used. It also could not be used if the percentages added to less than 100%.

The following graph is the same as the previous graph but the “Other/Unknown” percent (9.6%) has been included. The
“Other/Unknown” category is large compared to some of the other categories (Native American, 0.6%, Pacific Islander

This particular bar graph in Figure 1.8 can be difficult to understand visually. The graph in Figure 1.9 is a Pareto chart.
The Pareto chart has the bars sorted from largest to smallest and is easier to read and interpret.

Sampling
Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample
of the population. A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing. Most statisticians
use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most
common methods. There are several different methods of random sampling. In each form of random sampling, each
member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The
easiest method to describe is called a simple random sample. Any group of n individuals is equally likely to be chosen as
any other group of n individuals if the simple random sampling technique is used. In other words, each sample of the same
size has an equal chance of being selected.
Besides simple random sampling, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance process for getting the sample.
Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the cluster sample, and the systematic
sample.
To choose a stratified sample, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a proportionate number
from each stratum. For example, you could stratify (group) your college population by department and then choose a

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

17

proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random sample. To choose
a simple random sample from each department, number each member of the first department, number each member of
the second department, and do the same for the remaining departments. Then use simple random sampling to choose
proportionate numbers from the first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers
picked from the first department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the
stratified sample.
To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters.
All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments
from your college population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department.
The departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random
sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample.
To choose a systematic sample, randomly select a starting point and take every nth piece of data from a listing of the
population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000 residence listings. You
must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1–20,000 and then use a simple random sample to pick a
number that represents the first name in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth name thereafter until you have a total of 400
names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because
it is a simple method.
A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. Convenience sampling involves using results that are
readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers
who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very
good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.
Sampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to
households and then returned may be very biased (they may favor a certain group). It is better for the person conducting the
survey to select the sample respondents.
True random sampling is done with replacement. That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the
population and thus may be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random
sampling is done without replacement. Surveys are typically done without replacement. That is, a member of the
population may be chosen only once. Most samples are taken from large populations and the sample tends to be small in
comparison to the population. Since this is the case, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling
with replacement because the chance of picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low.
In a college population of 10,000 people, suppose you want to pick a sample of 1,000 randomly for a survey. For any
particular sample of 1,000, if you are sampling with replacement,
• the chance of picking the first person is 1,000 out of 10,000 (0.1000);
• the chance of picking a different second person for this sample is 999 out of 10,000 (0.0999);
• the chance of picking the same person again is 1 out of 10,000 (very low).
If you are sampling without replacement,
• the chance of picking the first person for any particular sample is 1000 out of 10,000 (0.1000);
• the chance of picking a different second person is 999 out of 9,999 (0.0999);
• you do not replace the first person before picking the next person.
Compare the fractions 999/10,000 and 999/9,999. For accuracy, carry the decimal answers to four decimal places. To four
decimal places, these numbers are equivalent (0.0999).
Sampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement becomes a mathematical issue only when the
population is small. For example, if the population is 25 people, the sample is ten, and you are sampling with replacement
for any particular sample, then the chance of picking the first person is ten out of 25, and the chance of picking a different
second person is nine out of 25 (you replace the first person).
If you sample without replacement, then the chance of picking the first person is ten out of 25, and then the chance of
picking the second person (who is different) is nine out of 24 (you do not replace the first person).
Compare the fractions 9/25 and 9/24. To four decimal places, 9/25 = 0.3600 and 9/24 = 0.3750. To four decimal places,
these numbers are not equivalent.
When you analyze data, it is important to be aware of sampling errors and nonsampling errors. The actual process of
sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling

18

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

process cause nonsampling errors. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.
In reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error. As a
rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.
In statistics, a sampling bias is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population
are not as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of
being chosen). When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being
studied.

Critical Evaluation
We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the
studies. Common problems to be aware of include
• Problems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the
population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and
not valid.
• Self-selected samples: Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in surveys, are often unreliable.
• Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some
situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples: crash testing cars
or medical testing for rare conditions
• Undue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response
• Non-response or refusal of subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be representative of the
population. Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results.
• Causality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related
(correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.
• Self-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is
the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good,
but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.
• Misleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context
• Confounding: When the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated. Confounding makes it difficult
or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor.

Example 1.11
A study is done to determine the average tuition that San Jose State undergraduate students pay per semester.
Each student in the following samples is asked how much tuition he or she paid for the Fall semester. What is the
type of sampling in each case?
a. A sample of 100 undergraduate San Jose State students is taken by organizing the students’ names by
classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior), and then selecting 25 students from each.
b. A random number generator is used to select a student from the alphabetical listing of all undergraduate
students in the Fall semester. Starting with that student, every 50th student is chosen until 75 students are
included in the sample.
c. A completely random method is used to select 75 students. Each undergraduate student in the fall semester
has the same probability of being chosen at any stage of the sampling process.
d. The freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years are numbered one, two, three, and four, respectively.
A random number generator is used to pick two of those years. All students in those two years are in the
sample.
e. An administrative assistant is asked to stand in front of the library one Wednesday and to ask the first 100
undergraduate students he encounters what they paid for tuition the Fall semester. Those 100 students are
the sample.

Solution 1.11
a. stratified; b. systematic; c. simple random; d. cluster; e. convenience

Example 1.12
Determine the type of sampling used (simple random, stratified, systematic, cluster, or convenience).
a. A soccer coach selects six players from a group of boys aged eight to ten, seven players from a group of
boys aged 11 to 12, and three players from a group of boys aged 13 to 14 to form a recreational soccer team.
b. A pollster interviews all human resource personnel in five different high tech companies.
c. A high school educational researcher interviews 50 high school female teachers and 50 high school male
teachers.
d. A medical researcher interviews every third cancer patient from a list of cancer patients at a local hospital.
e. A high school counselor uses a computer to generate 50 random numbers and then picks students whose
names correspond to the numbers.
f. A student interviews classmates in his algebra class to determine how many pairs of jeans a student owns,
on the average.
Solution 1.12
a. stratified; b. cluster; c. stratified; d. systematic; e. simple random; f.convenience
If we were to examine two samples representing the same population, even if we used random sampling methods for the
samples, they would not be exactly the same. Just as there is variation in data, there is variation in samples. As you become
accustomed to sampling, the variability will begin to seem natural.

Example 1.13
Suppose ABC College has 10,000 part-time students (the population). We are interested in the average amount of
money a part-time student spends on books in the fall term. Asking all 10,000 students is an almost impossible
task.
Suppose we take two different samples.
First, we use convenience sampling and survey ten students from a first term organic chemistry class. Many of
these students are taking first term calculus in addition to the organic chemistry class. The amount of money they
spend on books is as follows:
$128; $87; $173; $116; $130; $204; $147; $189; $93; $153
The second sample is taken using a list of senior citizens who take P.E. classes and taking every fifth senior citizen
on the list, for a total of ten senior citizens. They spend:
$50; $40; $36; $15; $50; $100; $40; $53; $22; $22
It is unlikely that any student is in both samples.
a. Do you think that either of these samples is representative of (or is characteristic of) the entire 10,000 part-time
student population?
Solution 1.13
a. No. The first sample probably consists of science-oriented students. Besides the chemistry course, some of
them are also taking first-term calculus. Books for these classes tend to be expensive. Most of these students are,
more than likely, paying more than the average part-time student for their books. The second sample is a group of
senior citizens who are, more than likely, taking courses for health and interest. The amount of money they spend
on books is probably much less than the average parttime student. Both samples are biased. Also, in both cases,

20

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

not all students have a chance to be in either sample.
b. Since these samples are not representative of the entire population, is it wise to use the results to describe the
entire population?
Solution 1.13
b. No. For these samples, each member of the population did not have an equally likely chance of being chosen.
Now, suppose we take a third sample. We choose ten different part-time students from the disciplines of
chemistry, math, English, psychology, sociology, history, nursing, physical education, art, and early childhood
development. (We assume that these are the only disciplines in which part-time students at ABC College are
enrolled and that an equal number of part-time students are enrolled in each of the disciplines.) Each student is
chosen using simple random sampling. Using a calculator, random numbers are generated and a student from
a particular discipline is selected if he or she has a corresponding number. The students spend the following
amounts:
$180; $50; $150; $85; $260; $75; $180; $200; $200; $150
c. Is the sample biased?
Solution 1.13
c. The sample is unbiased, but a larger sample would be recommended to increase the likelihood that the sample
will be close to representative of the population. However, for a biased sampling technique, even a large sample
runs the risk of not being representative of the population.
Students often ask if it is "good enough" to take a sample, instead of surveying the entire population. If the survey
is done well, the answer is yes.

1.13 A local radio station has a fan base of 20,000 listeners. The station wants to know if its audience would prefer
more music or more talk shows. Asking all 20,000 listeners is an almost impossible task.
The station uses convenience sampling and surveys the first 200 people they meet at one of the station’s music concert
events. 24 people said they’d prefer more talk shows, and 176 people said they’d prefer more music.
Do you think that this sample is representative of (or is characteristic of) the entire 20,000 listener population?

Variation in Data
Variation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of
liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage:
15.8; 16.1; 15.2; 14.8; 15.8; 15.9; 16.0; 15.5
Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or
because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if
the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range.
Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose.
This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time
for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy.

Variation in Samples
It was mentioned previously that two or more samples from the same population, taken randomly, and having close to
the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide
to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep each night. Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500
students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses cluster sampling. Doreen's sample will be different from Jung's
sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

21

would be wrong, however.
Think about what contributes to making Doreen’s and Jung’s samples different.
If Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e. the number of data values is increased), their sample results (the average
amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all
likelihood, different from each other. This variability in samples cannot be stressed enough.

Size of a Sample
The size of a sample (often called the number of observations, usually given the symbol n) is important. The examples you
have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient
for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200 to 1,500 observations are considered large enough and good
enough if the survey is random and is well done. Later we will find that even much smaller sample sizes will give very good
results. You will learn why when you study confidence intervals.
Be aware that many large samples are biased. For example, call-in surveys are invariably biased, because people choose to
respond or not.

1.3 | Levels of Measurement
Once you have a set of data, you will need to organize it so that you can analyze how frequently each datum occurs in the
set. However, when calculating the frequency, you may need to round your answers so that they are as precise as possible.

Levels of Measurement
The way a set of data is measured is called its level of measurement. Correct statistical procedures depend on a researcher
being familiar with levels of measurement. Not every statistical operation can be used with every set of data. Data can be
classified into four levels of measurement. They are (from lowest to highest level):
• Nominal scale level
• Ordinal scale level
• Interval scale level
• Ratio scale level
Data that is measured using a nominal scale is qualitative (categorical). Categories, colors, names, labels and favorite
foods along with yes or no responses are examples of nominal level data. Nominal scale data are not ordered. For example,
trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense. Putting pizza first and sushi second is not
meaningful.
Smartphone companies are another example of nominal scale data. The data are the names of the companies that make
smartphones, but there is no agreed upon order of these brands, even though people may have personal preferences. Nominal
scale data cannot be used in calculations.
Data that is measured using an ordinal scale is similar to nominal scale data but there is a big difference. The ordinal scale
data can be ordered. An example of ordinal scale data is a list of the top five national parks in the United States. The top
five national parks in the United States can be ranked from one to five but we cannot measure differences between the data.
Another example of using the ordinal scale is a cruise survey where the responses to questions about the cruise are
“excellent,” “good,” “satisfactory,” and “unsatisfactory.” These responses are ordered from the most desired response to the
least desired. But the differences between two pieces of data cannot be measured. Like the nominal scale data, ordinal scale
data cannot be used in calculations.
Data that is measured using the interval scale is similar to ordinal level data because it has a definite ordering but there
is a difference between data. The differences between interval scale data can be measured though the data does not have a
starting point.
Temperature scales like Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F) are measured by using the interval scale. In both temperature
measurements, 40° is equal to 100° minus 60°. Differences make sense. But 0 degrees does not because, in both scales, 0 is
not the absolute lowest temperature. Temperatures like -10° F and -15° C exist and are colder than 0.
Interval level data can be used in calculations, but one type of comparison cannot be done. 80° C is not four times as hot as
20° C (nor is 80° F four times as hot as 20° F). There is no meaning to the ratio of 80 to 20 (or four to one).
Data that is measured using the ratio scale takes care of the ratio problem and gives you the most information. Ratio scale
data is like interval scale data, but it has a 0 point and ratios can be calculated. For example, four multiple choice statistics

22

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

final exam scores are 80, 68, 20 and 92 (out of a possible 100 points). The exams are machine-graded.
The data can be put in order from lowest to highest: 20, 68, 80, 92.
The differences between the data have meaning. The score 92 is more than the score 68 by 24 points. Ratios can be
calculated. The smallest score is 0. So 80 is four times 20. The score of 80 is four times better than the score of 20.

Frequency
Twenty students were asked how many hours they worked per day. Their responses, in hours, are as follows: 5; 6; 3; 3; 2;
4; 7; 5; 2; 3; 5; 6; 5; 4; 4; 3; 5; 2; 5; 3.

Table 1.5 Frequency Table of
Student Work Hours

A frequency is the number of times a value of the data occurs. According to Table 1.5, there are three students who work
two hours, five students who work three hours, and so on. The sum of the values in the frequency column, 20, represents
the total number of students included in the sample.
A relative frequency is the ratio (fraction or proportion) of the number of times a value of the data occurs in the set of all
outcomes to the total number of outcomes. To find the relative frequencies, divide each frequency by the total number of
students in the sample–in this case, 20. Relative frequencies can be written as fractions, percents, or decimals.

The data in this table have been grouped into the following intervals:
• 59.95 to 61.95 inches
• 61.95 to 63.95 inches
• 63.95 to 65.95 inches
• 65.95 to 67.95 inches
• 67.95 to 69.95 inches
• 69.95 to 71.95 inches
• 71.95 to 73.95 inches
• 73.95 to 75.95 inches
In this sample, there are five players whose heights fall within the interval 59.95–61.95 inches, three players whose heights
fall within the interval 61.95–63.95 inches, 15 players whose heights fall within the interval 63.95–65.95 inches, 40 players
whose heights fall within the interval 65.95–67.95 inches, 17 players whose heights fall within the interval 67.95–69.95
inches, 12 players whose heights fall within the interval 69.95–71.95, seven players whose heights fall within the interval
71.95–73.95, and one player whose heights fall within the interval 73.95–75.95. All heights fall between the endpoints of
an interval and not at the endpoints.

Example 1.14
From Table 1.8, find the percentage of heights that are less than 65.95 inches.
Solution 1.14
If you look at the first, second, and third rows, the heights are all less than 65.95 inches. There are 5 + 3 + 15 = 23
players whose heights are less than 65.95 inches. The percentage of heights less than 65.95 inches is then 23

The purpose of an experiment is to investigate the relationship between two variables. When one variable causes change
in another, we call the first variable the independent variable or explanatory variable. The affected variable is called
the dependent variable or response variable: stimulus, response. In a randomized experiment, the researcher manipulates
values of the explanatory variable and measures the resulting changes in the response variable. The different values of the
explanatory variable are called treatments. An experimental unit is a single object or individual to be measured.
You want to investigate the effectiveness of vitamin E in preventing disease. You recruit a group of subjects and ask them
if they regularly take vitamin E. You notice that the subjects who take vitamin E exhibit better health on average than
those who do not. Does this prove that vitamin E is effective in disease prevention? It does not. There are many differences
between the two groups compared in addition to vitamin E consumption. People who take vitamin E regularly often take
other steps to improve their health: exercise, diet, other vitamin supplements, choosing not to smoke. Any one of these
factors could be influencing health. As described, this study does not prove that vitamin E is the key to disease prevention.
Additional variables that can cloud a study are called lurking variables. In order to prove that the explanatory variable is
causing a change in the response variable, it is necessary to isolate the explanatory variable. The researcher must design her
experiment in such a way that there is only one difference between groups being compared: the planned treatments. This is

30

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

accomplished by the random assignment of experimental units to treatment groups. When subjects are assigned treatments
randomly, all of the potential lurking variables are spread equally among the groups. At this point the only difference
between groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Different outcomes measured in the response variable, therefore, must
be a direct result of the different treatments. In this way, an experiment can prove a cause-and-effect connection between
the explanatory and response variables.
The power of suggestion can have an important influence on the outcome of an experiment. Studies have shown that the
expectation of the study participant can be as important as the actual medication. In one study of performance-enhancing
drugs, researchers noted:
Results showed that believing one had taken the substance resulted in [performance] times almost as fast as those associated
with consuming the drug itself. In contrast, taking the drug without knowledge yielded no significant performance
increment.[1]
When participation in a study prompts a physical response from a participant, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the
explanatory variable. To counter the power of suggestion, researchers set aside one treatment group as a control group.
This group is given a placebo treatment–a treatment that cannot influence the response variable. The control group helps
researchers balance the effects of being in an experiment with the effects of the active treatments. Of course, if you are
participating in a study and you know that you are receiving a pill which contains no actual medication, then the power of
suggestion is no longer a factor. Blinding in a randomized experiment preserves the power of suggestion. When a person
involved in a research study is blinded, he does not know who is receiving the active treatment(s) and who is receiving
the placebo treatment. A double-blind experiment is one in which both the subjects and the researchers involved with the
subjects are blinded.

Example 1.19
The Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation conducted a study to investigate whether smell can
affect learning. Subjects completed mazes multiple times while wearing masks. They completed the pencil and
paper mazes three times wearing floral-scented masks, and three times with unscented masks. Participants were
assigned at random to wear the floral mask during the first three trials or during the last three trials. For each
trial, researchers recorded the time it took to complete the maze and the subject’s impression of the mask’s scent:
positive, negative, or neutral.
a. Describe the explanatory and response variables in this study.
b. What are the treatments?
c. Identify any lurking variables that could interfere with this study.
d. Is it possible to use blinding in this study?
Solution 1.19
a. The explanatory variable is scent, and the response variable is the time it takes to complete the maze.
b. There are two treatments: a floral-scented mask and an unscented mask.
c. All subjects experienced both treatments. The order of treatments was randomly assigned so there were no
differences between the treatment groups. Random assignment eliminates the problem of lurking variables.
d. Subjects will clearly know whether they can smell flowers or not, so subjects cannot be blinded in this study.
Researchers timing the mazes can be blinded, though. The researcher who is observing a subject will not
know which mask is being worn.

KEY TERMS
Average also called mean or arithmetic mean; a number that describes the central tendency of the data
Blinding not telling participants which treatment a subject is receiving
Categorical Variable variables that take on values that are names or labels
Cluster Sampling a method for selecting a random sample and dividing the population into groups (clusters); use
simple random sampling to select a set of clusters. Every individual in the chosen clusters is included in the sample.
Continuous Random Variable a random variable (RV) whose outcomes are measured; the height of trees in the
forest is a continuous RV.

exactly as the other groups
Convenience Sampling a nonrandom method of selecting a sample; this method selects individuals that are easily
accessible and may result in biased data.
Cumulative Relative Frequency The term applies to an ordered set of observations from smallest to largest. The
cumulative relative frequency is the sum of the relative frequencies for all values that are less than or equal to the
given value.
Data a set of observations (a set of possible outcomes); most data can be put into two groups: qualitative (an attribute
whose value is indicated by a label) or quantitative (an attribute whose value is indicated by a number).
Quantitative data can be separated into two subgroups: discrete and continuous. Data is discrete if it is the result of
counting (such as the number of students of a given ethnic group in a class or the number of books on a shelf). Data
is continuous if it is the result of measuring (such as distance traveled or weight of luggage)
Discrete Random Variable a random variable (RV) whose outcomes are counted
Double-blinding the act of blinding both the subjects of an experiment and the researchers who work with the subjects
Experimental Unit any individual or object to be measured
Explanatory Variable the independent variable in an experiment; the value controlled by researchers

Informed Consent Any human subject in a research study must be cognizant of any risks or costs associated with the
study. The subject has the right to know the nature of the treatments included in the study, their potential risks, and
their potential benefits. Consent must be given freely by an informed, fit participant.
Institutional Review Board a committee tasked with oversight of research programs that involve human subjects
Lurking Variable a variable that has an effect on a study even though it is neither an explanatory variable nor a
response variable
Mathematical Models a description of a phenomenon using mathematical concepts, such as equations, inequalities,
distributions, etc.
Nonsampling Error an issue that affects the reliability of sampling data other than natural variation; it includes a
variety of human errors including poor study design, biased sampling methods, inaccurate information provided by
study participants, data entry errors, and poor analysis.

Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data

Population all individuals, objects, or measurements whose properties are being studied
Probability a number between zero and one, inclusive, that gives the likelihood that a specific event will occur
Proportion the number of successes divided by the total number in the sample
Qualitative Data See Data.
Quantitative Data See Data.
Random Assignment the act of organizing experimental units into treatment groups using random methods
Random Sampling a method of selecting a sample that gives every member of the population an equal chance of
being selected.
Relative Frequency the ratio of the number of times a value of the data occurs in the set of all outcomes to the number
of all outcomes to the total number of outcomes
Representative Sample a subset of the population that has the same characteristics as the population
Response Variable the dependent variable in an experiment; the value that is measured for change at the end of an
experiment
Sample a subset of the population studied
Sampling Bias not all members of the population are equally likely to be selected
Sampling Error the natural variation that results from selecting a sample to represent a larger population; this variation
decreases as the sample size increases, so selecting larger samples reduces sampling error.
Sampling with Replacement Once a member of the population is selected for inclusion in a sample, that member is
returned to the population for the selection of the next individual.
Sampling without Replacement A member of the population may be chosen for inclusion in a sample only once. If
chosen, the member is not returned to the population before the next selection.
Simple Random Sampling a straightforward method for selecting a random sample; give each member of the
population a number. Use a random number generator to select a set of labels. These randomly selected labels
identify the members of your sample.
Statistic a numerical characteristic of the sample; a statistic estimates the corresponding population parameter.
Statistical Models a description of a phenomenon using probability distributions that describe the expected behavior
of the phenomenon and the variability in the expected observations.
Stratified Sampling a method for selecting a random sample used to ensure that subgroups of the population are
represented adequately; divide the population into groups (strata). Use simple random sampling to identify a
proportionate number of individuals from each stratum.
Survey a study in which data is collected as reported by individuals.
Systematic Sampling a method for selecting a random sample; list the members of the population. Use simple
random sampling to select a starting point in the population. Let k = (number of individuals in the
population)/(number of individuals needed in the sample). Choose every kth individual in the list starting with the
one that was randomly selected. If necessary, return to the beginning of the population list to complete your sample.
Treatments different values or components of the explanatory variable applied in an experiment
Variable a characteristic of interest for each person or object in a population

CHAPTER REVIEW
1.1 Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms
The mathematical theory of statistics is easier to learn when you know the language. This module presents important terms
that will be used throughout the text.

1.2 Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling
Data are individual items of information that come from a population or sample. Data may be classified as qualitative
(categorical), quantitative continuous, or quantitative discrete.
Because it is not practical to measure the entire population in a study, researchers use samples to represent the population.
A random sample is a representative group from the population chosen by using a method that gives each individual in the
population an equal chance of being included in the sample. Random sampling methods include simple random sampling,
stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Convenience sampling is a nonrandom method of choosing
a sample that often produces biased data.
Samples that contain different individuals result in different data. This is true even when the samples are well-chosen and
representative of the population. When properly selected, larger samples model the population more closely than smaller
samples. There are many different potential problems that can affect the reliability of a sample. Statistical data needs to be
critically analyzed, not simply accepted.

1.3 Levels of Measurement
Some calculations generate numbers that are artificially precise. It is not necessary to report a value to eight decimal places
when the measures that generated that value were only accurate to the nearest tenth. Round off your final answer to one
more decimal place than was present in the original data. This means that if you have data measured to the nearest tenth of
a unit, report the final statistic to the nearest hundredth.
In addition to rounding your answers, you can measure your data using the following four levels of measurement.
• Nominal scale level: data that cannot be ordered nor can it be used in calculations
• Ordinal scale level: data that can be ordered; the differences cannot be measured
• Interval scale level: data with a definite ordering but no starting point; the differences can be measured, but there is
no such thing as a ratio.
• Ratio scale level: data with a starting point that can be ordered; the differences have meaning and ratios can be
calculated.
When organizing data, it is important to know how many times a value appears. How many statistics students study five
hours or more for an exam? What percent of families on our block own two pets? Frequency, relative frequency, and
cumulative relative frequency are measures that answer questions like these.

1.4 Experimental Design and Ethics
A poorly designed study will not produce reliable data. There are certain key components that must be included in every
experiment. To eliminate lurking variables, subjects must be assigned randomly to different treatment groups. One of the
groups must act as a control group, demonstrating what happens when the active treatment is not applied. Participants in
the control group receive a placebo treatment that looks exactly like the active treatments but cannot influence the response
variable. To preserve the integrity of the placebo, both researchers and subjects may be blinded. When a study is designed
properly, the only difference between treatment groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Therefore, when groups
respond differently to different treatments, the difference must be due to the influence of the explanatory variable.
“An ethics problem arises when you are considering an action that benefits you or some cause you support, hurts or
reduces benefits to others, and violates some rule.”[2] Ethical violations in statistics are not always easy to spot. Professional
associations and federal agencies post guidelines for proper conduct. It is important that you learn basic statistical
procedures so that you can recognize proper data analysis.

32. Name the sampling method used in each of the following situations:
a. A woman in the airport is handing out questionnaires to travelers asking them to evaluate the airport’s service.
She does not ask travelers who are hurrying through the airport with their hands full of luggage, but instead asks
all travelers who are sitting near gates and not taking naps while they wait.
b. A teacher wants to know if her students are doing homework, so she randomly selects rows two and five and then
calls on all students in row two and all students in row five to present the solutions to homework problems to the
class.
c. The marketing manager for an electronics chain store wants information about the ages of its customers. Over
the next two weeks, at each store location, 100 randomly selected customers are given questionnaires to fill out
asking for information about age, as well as about other variables of interest.
d. The librarian at a public library wants to determine what proportion of the library users are children. The librarian
has a tally sheet on which she marks whether books are checked out by an adult or a child. She records this data
for every fourth patron who checks out books.
e. A political party wants to know the reaction of voters to a debate between the candidates. The day after the debate,
the party’s polling staff calls 1,200 randomly selected phone numbers. If a registered voter answers the phone or
is available to come to the phone, that registered voter is asked whom he or she intends to vote for and whether
the debate changed his or her opinion of the candidates.
33. A “random survey” was conducted of 3,274 people of the “microprocessor generation” (people born since 1971, the
year the microprocessor was invented). It was reported that 48% of those individuals surveyed stated that if they had $2,000
to spend, they would use it for computer equipment. Also, 66% of those surveyed considered themselves relatively savvy
computer users.
a. Do you consider the sample size large enough for a study of this type? Why or why not?
b. Based on your “gut feeling,” do you believe the percents accurately reflect the U.S. population for those
individuals born since 1971? If not, do you think the percents of the population are actually higher or lower than
the sample statistics? Why?
Additional information: The survey, reported by Intel Corporation, was filled out by individuals who visited the
Los Angeles Convention Center to see the Smithsonian Institute's road show called “America’s Smithsonian.”
c. With this additional information, do you feel that all demographic and ethnic groups were equally represented at
the event? Why or why not?
d. With the additional information, comment on how accurately you think the sample statistics reflect the population
parameters.
34. The Well-Being Index is a survey that follows trends of U.S. residents on a regular basis. There are six areas of
health and wellness covered in the survey: Life Evaluation, Emotional Health, Physical Health, Healthy Behavior, Work
Environment, and Basic Access. Some of the questions used to measure the Index are listed below.
Identify the type of data obtained from each question used in this survey: qualitative(categorical), quantitative discrete, or
quantitative continuous.
a.
b.
c.
d.

Do you have any health problems that prevent you from doing any of the things people your age can normally do?
During the past 30 days, for about how many days did poor health keep you from doing your usual activities?
In the last seven days, on how many days did you exercise for 30 minutes or more?
Do you have health insurance coverage?

35. In advance of the 1936 Presidential Election, a magazine titled Literary Digest released the results of an opinion
poll predicting that the republican candidate Alf Landon would win by a large margin. The magazine sent post cards
to approximately 10,000,000 prospective voters. These prospective voters were selected from the subscription list of the
magazine, from automobile registration lists, from phone lists, and from club membership lists. Approximately 2,300,000
people returned the postcards.
a. Think about the state of the United States in 1936. Explain why a sample chosen from magazine subscription lists,
automobile registration lists, phone books, and club membership lists was not representative of the population of
the United States at that time.
b. What effect does the low response rate have on the reliability of the sample?
c. Are these problems examples of sampling error or nonsampling error?
d. During the same year, George Gallup conducted his own poll of 30,000 prospective voters. These researchers used
a method they called "quota sampling" to obtain survey answers from specific subsets of the population. Quota
sampling is an example of which sampling method described in this module?

36. Crime-related and demographic statistics for 47 US states in 1960 were collected from government agencies, including
the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. One analysis of this data found a strong connection between education and crime
indicating that higher levels of education in a community correspond to higher crime rates.
Which of the potential problems with samples discussed in Section 1.2 could explain this connection?
37. YouPolls is a website that allows anyone to create and respond to polls. One question posted April 15 asks:
“Do you feel happy paying your taxes when members of the Obama administration are allowed to ignore their tax
liabilities?”[3]
As of April 25, 11 people responded to this question. Each participant answered “NO!”
Which of the potential problems with samples discussed in this module could explain this connection?
38. A scholarly article about response rates begins with the following quote:
“Declining contact and cooperation rates in random digit dial (RDD) national telephone surveys raise serious concerns
about the validity of estimates drawn from such research.”[4]
The Pew Research Center for People and the Press admits:
“The percentage of people we interview – out of all we try to interview – has been declining over the past decade or
more.”[5]
a. What are some reasons for the decline in response rate over the past decade?
b. Explain why researchers are concerned with the impact of the declining response rate on public opinion polls.

Conduct the survey on different days of the week.
26 Answers will vary. Sample Answer: You could use a systematic sampling method. Stop the tenth person as they leave
one of the buildings on campus at 9:50 in the morning. Then stop the tenth person as they leave a different building on
campus at 1:50 in the afternoon.
28 Answers will vary. Sample Answer: Many people will not respond to mail surveys. If they do respond to the surveys,

many factors that define a community other than education level and crime rate. Communities with high crime rates and
high education levels may have other lurking variables that distinguish them from communities with lower crime rates
and lower education levels. Because we cannot isolate these variables of interest, we cannot draw valid conclusions about
the connection between education and crime. Possible lurking variables include police expenditures, unemployment levels,
region, average age, and size.

STATISTICS

Figure 2.1 When you have large amounts of data, you will need to organize it in a way that makes sense. These
ballots from an election are rolled together with similar ballots to keep them organized. (credit: William Greeson)

Introduction
Once you have collected data, what will you do with it? Data can be described and presented in many different formats. For
example, suppose you are interested in buying a house in a particular area. You may have no clue about the house prices, so
you might ask your real estate agent to give you a sample data set of prices. Looking at all the prices in the sample often is
overwhelming. A better way might be to look at the median price and the variation of prices. The median and variation are
just two ways that you will learn to describe data. Your agent might also provide you with a graph of the data.
In this chapter, you will study numerical and graphical ways to describe and display your data. This area of statistics is called
"Descriptive Statistics." You will learn how to calculate, and even more importantly, how to interpret these measurements
and graphs.
A statistical graph is a tool that helps you learn about the shape or distribution of a sample or a population. A graph can be
a more effective way of presenting data than a mass of numbers because we can see where data clusters and where there are
only a few data values. Newspapers and the Internet use graphs to show trends and to enable readers to compare facts and
figures quickly. Statisticians often graph data first to get a picture of the data. Then, more formal tools may be applied.
Some of the types of graphs that are used to summarize and organize data are the dot plot, the bar graph, the histogram, the
stem-and-leaf plot, the frequency polygon (a type of broken line graph), the pie chart, and the box plot. In this chapter, we

46

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

will briefly look at stem-and-leaf plots, line graphs, and bar graphs, as well as frequency polygons, and time series graphs.
Our emphasis will be on histograms and box plots.

2.1 | Display Data
Stem-and-Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs
One simple graph, the stem-and-leaf graph or stemplot, comes from the field of exploratory data analysis. It is a good
choice when the data sets are small. To create the plot, divide each observation of data into a stem and a leaf. The leaf
consists of a final significant digit. For example, 23 has stem two and leaf three. The number 432 has stem 43 and leaf two.
Likewise, the number 5,432 has stem 543 and leaf two. The decimal 9.3 has stem nine and leaf three. Write the stems in a
vertical line from smallest to largest. Draw a vertical line to the right of the stems. Then write the leaves in increasing order
next to their corresponding stem.

Example 2.1
For Susan Dean's spring pre-calculus class, scores for the first exam were as follows (smallest to largest):
33; 42; 49; 49; 53; 55; 55; 61; 63; 67; 68; 68; 69; 69; 72; 73; 74; 78; 80; 83; 88; 88; 88; 90; 92; 94; 94; 94; 94;

Table 2.1 Stem-andLeaf Graph

The stemplot shows that most scores fell in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. Eight out of the 31 scores or approximately
⎛

⎞

26% ⎝ 8 ⎠ were in the 90s or 100, a fairly high number of As.

2.1 For the Park City basketball team, scores for the last 30 games were as follows (smallest to largest):
32; 32; 33; 34; 38; 40; 42; 42; 43; 44; 46; 47; 47; 48; 48; 48; 49; 50; 50; 51; 52; 52; 52; 53; 54; 56; 57; 57; 60; 61
Construct a stem plot for the data.

The stemplot is a quick way to graph data and gives an exact picture of the data. You want to look for an overall pattern
and any outliers. An outlier is an observation of data that does not fit the rest of the data. It is sometimes called an extreme
value. When you graph an outlier, it will appear not to fit the pattern of the graph. Some outliers are due to mistakes (for
example, writing down 50 instead of 500) while others may indicate that something unusual is happening. It takes some
background information to explain outliers, so we will cover them in more detail later.

Example 2.2
The data are the distances (in kilometers) from a home to local supermarkets. Create a stemplot using the data:
1.1; 1.5; 2.3; 2.5; 2.7; 3.2; 3.3; 3.3; 3.5; 3.8; 4.0; 4.2; 4.5; 4.5; 4.7; 4.8; 5.5; 5.6; 6.5; 6.7; 12.3
Do the data seem to have any concentration of values?

NOTE
The leaves are to the right of the decimal.

Solution 2.2
The value 12.3 may be an outlier. Values appear to concentrate at three and four kilometers.

Example 2.3
A side-by-side stem-and-leaf plot allows a comparison of the two data sets in two columns. In a side-by-side
stem-and-leaf plot, two sets of leaves share the same stem. The leaves are to the left and the right of the stems.

Another type of graph that is useful for specific data values is a line graph. In the particular line graph shown in Example
2.4, the x-axis (horizontal axis) consists of data values and the y-axis (vertical axis) consists of frequency points. The
frequency points are connected using line segments.

Example 2.4
In a survey, 40 mothers were asked how many times per week a teenager must be reminded to do his or her chores.

Given these data, calculate the conditional distributions for the subpopulation of men who own each pet type.

Men who own dogs = 4/8 = 0.5
Men who own cats = 2/8 = 0.25
Men who own fish = 2/8 = 0.25
Note: The sum of all of the conditional distributions must equal one. In this case, 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1; therefore,
the solution "checks".

Histograms, Frequency Polygons, and Time Series Graphs
For most of the work you do in this book, you will use a histogram to display the data. One advantage of a histogram is that
it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb is to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more.
A histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The horizontal axis
is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The vertical axis is labeled either
frequency or relative frequency (or percent frequency or probability). The graph will have the same shape with either
label. The histogram (like the stemplot) can give you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data.
The relative frequency is equal to the frequency for an observed value of the data divided by the total number of data values
in the sample.(Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times an answer occurs.) If:
• f = frequency
• n = total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and
• RF = relative frequency,
then:

f
RF = n
For example, if three students in Mr. Ahab's English class of 40 students received from 90% to 100%, then, f = 3, n = 40,

f

and RF = n = 3 = 0.075. 7.5% of the students received 90–100%. 90–100% are quantitative measures.
40
To construct a histogram, first decide how many bars or intervals, also called classes, represent the data. Many
histograms consist of five to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose a starting point
for the first interval to be less than the smallest data value. A convenient starting point is a lower value carried out to one
more decimal place than the value with the most decimal places. For example, if the value with the most decimal places is
6.1 and this is the smallest value, a convenient starting point is 6.05 (6.1 – 0.05 = 6.05). We say that 6.05 has more precision.
If the value with the most decimal places is 2.23 and the lowest value is 1.5, a convenient starting point is 1.495 (1.5 – 0.005
= 1.495). If the value with the most decimal places is 3.234 and the lowest value is 1.0, a convenient starting point is 0.9995
(1.0 – 0.0005 = 0.9995). If all the data happen to be integers and the smallest value is two, then a convenient starting point
is 1.5 (2 – 0.5 = 1.5). Also, when the starting point and other boundaries are carried to one additional decimal place, no data

value will fall on a boundary. The next two examples go into detail about how to construct a histogram using continuous
data and how to create a histogram using discrete data.

Example 2.8
The following data are the heights (in inches to the nearest half inch) of 100 male semiprofessional soccer players.
The heights are continuous data, since height is measured.
60; 60.5; 61; 61; 61.5
63.5; 63.5; 63.5
64; 64; 64; 64; 64; 64; 64; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5
66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 67; 67; 67;
67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5
68; 68; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69.5; 69.5; 69.5; 69.5; 69.5
70; 70; 70; 70; 70; 70; 70.5; 70.5; 70.5; 71; 71; 71
72; 72; 72; 72.5; 72.5; 73; 73.5
74
The smallest data value is 60. Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal (for instance, 61.5),
we want our starting point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, etc. are convenient
numbers, use 0.05 and subtract it from 60, the smallest value, for the convenient starting point.
60 – 0.05 = 59.95 which is more precise than, say, 61.5 by one decimal place. The starting point is, then, 59.95.
The largest value is 74, so 74 + 0.05 = 74.05 is the ending value.
Next, calculate the width of each bar or class interval. To calculate this width, subtract the starting point from the
ending value and divide by the number of bars (you must choose the number of bars you desire). Suppose you
choose eight bars.

74.05 − 59.95 = 1.76
8
NOTE
We will round up to two and make each bar or class interval two units wide. Rounding up to two is one
way to prevent a value from falling on a boundary. Rounding to the next number is often necessary even if
it goes against the standard rules of rounding. For this example, using 1.76 as the width would also work.
A guideline that is followed by some for the width of a bar or class interval is to take the square root of the
number of data values and then round to the nearest whole number, if necessary. For example, if there are
150 values of data, take the square root of 150 and round to 12 bars or intervals.

The boundaries are:
• 59.95
• 59.95 + 2 = 61.95
• 61.95 + 2 = 63.95
• 63.95 + 2 = 65.95
• 65.95 + 2 = 67.95
• 67.95 + 2 = 69.95
• 69.95 + 2 = 71.95
• 71.95 + 2 = 73.95
• 73.95 + 2 = 75.95
The heights 60 through 61.5 inches are in the interval 59.95–61.95. The heights that are 63.5 are in the interval
61.95–63.95. The heights that are 64 through 64.5 are in the interval 63.95–65.95. The heights 66 through 67.5 are
in the interval 65.95–67.95. The heights 68 through 69.5 are in the interval 67.95–69.95. The heights 70 through
71 are in the interval 69.95–71.95. The heights 72 through 73.5 are in the interval 71.95–73.95. The height 74 is

in the interval 73.95–75.95.
The following histogram displays the heights on the x-axis and relative frequency on the y-axis.

The following data are the shoe sizes of 50 male students. The sizes are continuous data since shoe size is

Example 2.9
Create a histogram for the following data: the number of books bought by 50 part-time college students at ABC
College. The number of books is discrete data, since books are counted.
1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1
2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2

4; 4; 4; 4; 4; 4
5; 5; 5; 5; 5
6; 6
Eleven students buy one book. Ten students buy two books. Sixteen students buy three books. Six students buy
four books. Five students buy five books. Two students buy six books.
Because the data are integers, subtract 0.5 from 1, the smallest data value and add 0.5 to 6, the largest data value.
Then the starting point is 0.5 and the ending value is 6.5.
Next, calculate the width of each bar or class interval. If the data are discrete and there are not too many different
values, a width that places the data values in the middle of the bar or class interval is the most convenient. Since
the data consist of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the starting point is 0.5, a width of one places the 1 in the
middle of the interval from 0.5 to 1.5, the 2 in the middle of the interval from 1.5 to 2.5, the 3 in the middle of the
interval from 2.5 to 3.5, the 4 in the middle of the interval from _______ to _______, the 5 in the middle of the
interval from _______ to _______, and the _______ in the middle of the interval from _______ to _______ .

Some values in this data set fall on boundaries for the class intervals. A value is counted in a class interval if it
falls on the left boundary, but not if it falls on the right boundary. Different researchers may set up histograms for
the same data in different ways. There is more than one correct way to set up a histogram.

Frequency Polygons
Frequency polygons are analogous to line graphs, and just as line graphs make continuous data visually easy to interpret, so
too do frequency polygons.
To construct a frequency polygon, first examine the data and decide on the number of intervals, or class intervals, to use on
the x-axis and y-axis. After choosing the appropriate ranges, begin plotting the data points. After all the points are plotted,
draw line segments to connect them.

The first label on the x-axis is 44.5. This represents an interval extending from 39.5 to 49.5. Since the lowest test
score is 54.5, this interval is used only to allow the graph to touch the x-axis. The point labeled 54.5 represents
the next interval, or the first “real” interval from the table, and contains five scores. This reasoning is followed
for each of the remaining intervals with the point 104.5 representing the interval from 99.5 to 109.5. Again, this
interval contains no data and is only used so that the graph will touch the x-axis. Looking at the graph, we say
that this distribution is skewed because one side of the graph does not mirror the other side.

Constructing a Time Series Graph
Suppose that we want to study the temperature range of a region for an entire month. Every day at noon we note the
temperature and write this down in a log. A variety of statistical studies could be done with these data. We could find
the mean or the median temperature for the month. We could construct a histogram displaying the number of days that
temperatures reach a certain range of values. However, all of these methods ignore a portion of the data that we have
collected.
One feature of the data that we may want to consider is that of time. Since each date is paired with the temperature reading
for the day, we don‘t have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the times given to impose a chronological
order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing temperature as the month progresses is
called a time series graph.
To construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard Cartesian
coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the date or time increments, and the vertical axis is used to plot the
values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph correspond to a date and a
measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by straight lines in the order in which they occur.

Uses of a Time Series Graph
Time series graphs are important tools in various applications of statistics. When recording values of the same variable over
an extended period of time, sometimes it is difficult to discern any trend or pattern. However, once the same data points are
displayed graphically, some features jump out. Time series graphs make trends easy to spot.

How NOT to Lie with Statistics
It is important to remember that the very reason we develop a variety of methods to present data is to develop insights into
the subject of what the observations represent. We want to get a "sense" of the data. Are the observations all very much alike
or are they spread across a wide range of values, are they bunched at one end of the spectrum or are they distributed evenly
and so on. We are trying to get a visual picture of the numerical data. Shortly we will develop formal mathematical measures
of the data, but our visual graphical presentation can say much. It can, unfortunately, also say much that is distracting,
confusing and simply wrong in terms of the impression the visual leaves. Many years ago Darrell Huff wrote the book
How to Lie with Statistics. It has been through 25 plus printings and sold more than one and one-half million copies. His
perspective was a harsh one and used many actual examples that were designed to mislead. He wanted to make people

64

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

aware of such deception, but perhaps more importantly to educate so that others do not make the same errors inadvertently.
Again, the goal is to enlighten with visuals that tell the story of the data. Pie charts have a number of common problems
when used to convey the message of the data. Too many pieces of the pie overwhelm the reader. More than perhaps five or
six categories ought to give an idea of the relative importance of each piece. This is after all the goal of a pie chart, what
subset matters most relative to the others. If there are more components than this then perhaps an alternative approach would
be better or perhaps some can be consolidated into an "other" category. Pie charts cannot show changes over time, although
we see this attempted all too often. In federal, state, and city finance documents pie charts are often presented to show the
components of revenue available to the governing body for appropriation: income tax, sales tax motor vehicle taxes and so
on. In and of itself this is interesting information and can be nicely done with a pie chart. The error occurs when two years
are set side-by-side. Because the total revenues change year to year, but the size of the pie is fixed, no real information is
provided and the relative size of each piece of the pie cannot be meaningfully compared.
Histograms can be very helpful in understanding the data. Properly presented, they can be a quick visual way to present
probabilities of different categories by the simple visual of comparing relative areas in each category. Here the error,
purposeful or not, is to vary the width of the categories. This of course makes comparison to the other categories impossible.
It does embellish the importance of the category with the expanded width because it has a greater area, inappropriately, and
thus visually "says" that that category has a higher probability of occurrence.
Time series graphs perhaps are the most abused. A plot of some variable across time should never be presented on axes
that change part way across the page either in the vertical or horizontal dimension. Perhaps the time frame is changed from
years to months. Perhaps this is to save space or because monthly data was not available for early years. In either case this
confounds the presentation and destroys any value of the graph. If this is not done to purposefully confuse the reader, then
it certainly is either lazy or sloppy work.
Changing the units of measurement of the axis can smooth out a drop or accentuate one. If you want to show large changes,
then measure the variable in small units, penny rather than thousands of dollars. And of course to continue the fraud, be
sure that the axis does not begin at zero, zero. If it begins at zero, zero, then it becomes apparent that the axis has been
manipulated.
Perhaps you have a client that is concerned with the volatility of the portfolio you manage. An easy way to present the data
is to use long time periods on the time series graph. Use months or better, quarters rather than daily or weekly data. If that
doesn't get the volatility down then spread the time axis relative to the rate of return or portfolio valuation axis. If you want
to show "quick" dramatic growth, then shrink the time axis. Any positive growth will show visually "high" growth rates.
Do note that if the growth is negative then this trick will show the portfolio is collapsing at a dramatic rate.
Again, the goal of descriptive statistics is to convey meaningful visuals that tell the story of the data. Purposeful
manipulation is fraud and unethical at the worst, but even at its best, making these type of errors will lead to confusion on
the part of the analysis.

2.2 | Measures of the Location of the Data
The common measures of location are quartiles and percentiles
Quartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile, Q3, is the
same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th percentile.
To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide ordered data
into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. To score in the 90th percentile of an exam does not mean,
necessarily, that you received 90% on a test. It means that 90% of test scores are the same or less than your score and 10%
of the test scores are the same or greater than your test score.
Percentiles are useful for comparing values. For this reason, universities and colleges use percentiles extensively. One
instance in which colleges and universities use percentiles is when SAT results are used to determine a minimum testing
score that will be used as an acceptance factor. For example, suppose Duke accepts SAT scores at or above the 75th
percentile. That translates into a score of at least 1220.
Percentiles are mostly used with very large populations. Therefore, if you were to say that 90% of the test scores are
less (and not the same or less) than your score, it would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is not
significant.
The median is a number that measures the "center" of the data. You can think of the median as the "middle value," but
it does not actually have to be one of the observed values. It is a number that separates ordered data into halves. Half the
values are the same number or smaller than the median, and half the values are the same number or larger. For example,
consider the following data.

Since there are 14 observations, the median is between the seventh value, 6.8, and the eighth value, 7.2. To find the median,
add the two values together and divide by two.

6.8 + 7.2 = 7
2
The median is seven. Half of the values are smaller than seven and half of the values are larger than seven.
Quartiles are numbers that separate the data into quarters. Quartiles may or may not be part of the data. To find the quartiles,
first find the median or second quartile. The first quartile, Q1, is the middle value of the lower half of the data, and the third
quartile, Q3, is the middle value, or median, of the upper half of the data. To get the idea, consider the same data set:
1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8; 7.2; 8; 8.3; 9; 10; 10; 11.5
The median or second quartile is seven. The lower half of the data are 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8. The middle value of the lower
half is two.
1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8
The number two, which is part of the data, is the first quartile. One-fourth of the entire sets of values are the same as or
less than two and three-fourths of the values are more than two.
The upper half of the data is 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5. The middle value of the upper half is nine.
The third quartile, Q3, is nine. Three-fourths (75%) of the ordered data set are less than nine. One-fourth (25%) of the
ordered data set are greater than nine. The third quartile is part of the data set in this example.
The interquartile range is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half or the middle 50% of the data. It is the
difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1).
IQR = Q3 – Q1
The IQR can help to determine potential outliers. A value is suspected to be a potential outlier if it is less than (1.5)(IQR)
below the first quartile or more than (1.5)(IQR) above the third quartile. Potential outliers always require further
investigation.

NOTE
A potential outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other data points. These special data points
may be errors or some kind of abnormality or they may be a key to understanding the data.

Example 2.14
For the following 13 real estate prices, calculate the IQR and determine if any prices are potential outliers. Prices
are in dollars.
389,950; 230,500; 158,000; 479,000; 639,000; 114,950; 5,500,000; 387,000; 659,000; 529,000; 575,000;
488,800; 1,095,000
Solution 2.14
Order the data from smallest to largest.
114,950; 158,000; 230,500; 387,000; 389,950; 479,000; 488,800; 529,000; 575,000; 639,000; 659,000;
1,095,000; 5,500,000
M = 488,800
Q1 =

230,500 + 387,000 = 308,750
2

Q3 =

639,000 + 659,000 = 649,000
2

IQR = 649,000 – 308,750 = 340,250

66

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

(1.5)(IQR) = (1.5)(340,250) = 510,375
Q1 – (1.5)(IQR) = 308,750 – 510,375 = –201,625
Q3 + (1.5)(IQR) = 649,000 + 510,375 = 1,159,375
No house price is less than –201,625. However, 5,500,000 is more than 1,159,375. Therefore, 5,500,000 is a
potential outlier.

Example 2.15
For the two data sets in the test scores example, find the following:
a. The interquartile range. Compare the two interquartile ranges.
b. Any outliers in either set.

Table 2.21

a. The IQR for the day group is Q3 – Q1 = 82.5 – 56 = 26.5
The IQR for the night group is Q3 – Q1 = 89 – 78 = 11
The interquartile range (the spread or variability) for the day class is larger than the night class IQR. This
suggests more variation will be found in the day class’s class test scores.
b. Day class outliers are found using the IQR times 1.5 rule. So,
Q1 - IQR(1.5) = 56 – 26.5(1.5) = 16.25
Q3 + IQR(1.5) = 82.5 + 26.5(1.5) = 122.25
Since the minimum and maximum values for the day class are greater than 16.25 and less than 122.25, there
are no outliers.
Night class outliers are calculated as:
Q1 – IQR (1.5) = 78 – 11(1.5) = 61.5
Q3 + IQR(1.5) = 89 + 11(1.5) = 105.5
For this class, any test score less than 61.5 is an outlier. Therefore, the scores of 45 and 25.5 are outliers.
Since no test score is greater than 105.5, there is no upper end outlier.

Table 2.22
Find the 28th percentile. Notice the 0.28 in the "cumulative relative frequency" column. Twenty-eight percent of
50 data values is 14 values. There are 14 values less than the 28th percentile. They include the two 4s, the five 5s,
and the seven 6s. The 28th percentile is between the last six and the first seven. The 28th percentile is 6.5.
Find the median. Look again at the "cumulative relative frequency" column and find 0.52. The median is the
50th percentile or the second quartile. 50% of 50 is 25. There are 25 values less than the median. They include the
two 4s, the five 5s, the seven 6s, and eleven of the 7s. The median or 50th percentile is between the 25th, or seven,
and 26th, or seven, values. The median is seven.
Find the third quartile. The third quartile is the same as the 75th percentile. You can "eyeball" this answer. If you
look at the "cumulative relative frequency" column, you find 0.52 and 0.80. When you have all the fours, fives,
sixes and sevens, you have 52% of the data. When you include all the 8s, you have 80% of the data. The 75th
percentile, then, must be an eight. Another way to look at the problem is to find 75% of 50, which is 37.5, and
round up to 38. The third quartile, Q3, is the 38th value, which is an eight. You can check this answer by counting
the values. (There are 37 values below the third quartile and 12 values above.)

Using Table 2.22:
a. Find the 80th percentile.
b. Find the 90th percentile.
c. Find the first quartile. What is another name for the first quartile?
Solution 2.17
Using the data from the frequency table, we have:
a. The 80th percentile is between the last eight and the first nine in the table (between the 40th and 41st values).
Therefore, we need to take the mean of the 40th an 41st values. The 80th percentile = 8 + 9 = 8.5

b. The 90 percentile will be the 45 data value (location is 0.90(50) = 45) and the 45 data value is nine.
c. Q1 is also the 25th percentile. The 25th percentile location calculation: P25 = 0.25(50) = 12.5 ≈ 13 the 13th
data value. Thus, the 25th percentile is six.

A Formula for Finding the kth Percentile
If you were to do a little research, you would find several formulas for calculating the kth percentile. Here is one of them.
k = the kth percentile. It may or may not be part of the data.
i = the index (ranking or position of a data value)
n = the total number of data points, or observations
• Order the data from smallest to largest.
• Calculate i = k (n + 1)

100

• If i is an integer, then the kth percentile is the data value in the ith position in the ordered set of data.
• If i is not an integer, then round i up and round i down to the nearest integers. Average the two data values in these two
positions in the ordered data set. This is easier to understand in an example.

Example 2.18
Listed are 29 ages for Academy Award winning best actors in order from smallest to largest.
18; 21; 22; 25; 26; 27; 29; 30; 31; 33; 36; 37; 41; 42; 47; 52; 55; 57; 58; 62; 64; 67; 69; 71; 72; 73; 74; 76; 77

Interpreting Percentiles, Quartiles, and Median
A percentile indicates the relative standing of a data value when data are sorted into numerical order from smallest to largest.
Percentages of data values are less than or equal to the pth percentile. For example, 15% of data values are less than or equal
to the 15th percentile.
• Low percentiles always correspond to lower data values.
• High percentiles always correspond to higher data values.
A percentile may or may not correspond to a value judgment about whether it is "good" or "bad." The interpretation of
whether a certain percentile is "good" or "bad" depends on the context of the situation to which the data applies. In some
situations, a low percentile would be considered "good;" in other contexts a high percentile might be considered "good". In
many situations, there is no value judgment that applies.

70

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

Understanding how to interpret percentiles properly is important not only when describing data, but also when calculating
probabilities in later chapters of this text.

NOTE
When writing the interpretation of a percentile in the context of the given data, the sentence should contain the
following information.
• information about the context of the situation being considered
• the data value (value of the variable) that represents the percentile
• the percent of individuals or items with data values below the percentile
• the percent of individuals or items with data values above the percentile.

Example 2.20
On a timed math test, the first quartile for time it took to finish the exam was 35 minutes. Interpret the first quartile
in the context of this situation.
Solution 2.20
• Twenty-five percent of students finished the exam in 35 minutes or less.
• Seventy-five percent of students finished the exam in 35 minutes or more.
• A low percentile could be considered good, as finishing more quickly on a timed exam is desirable. (If you
take too long, you might not be able to finish.)

Example 2.21
On a 20 question math test, the 70th percentile for number of correct answers was 16. Interpret the 70th percentile
in the context of this situation.
Solution 2.21
• Seventy percent of students answered 16 or fewer questions correctly.
• Thirty percent of students answered 16 or more questions correctly.
• A higher percentile could be considered good, as answering more questions correctly is desirable.

2.21 On a 60 point written assignment, the 80th percentile for the number of points earned was 49. Interpret the 80th
percentile in the context of this situation.

Example 2.22
At a community college, it was found that the 30th percentile of credit units that students are enrolled for is seven
units. Interpret the 30th percentile in the context of this situation.
Solution 2.22
• Thirty percent of students are enrolled in seven or fewer credit units.

71

• Seventy percent of students are enrolled in seven or more credit units.
• In this example, there is no "good" or "bad" value judgment associated with a higher or lower percentile.
Students attend community college for varied reasons and needs, and their course load varies according to
their needs.

Example 2.23
Sharpe Middle School is applying for a grant that will be used to add fitness equipment to the gym. The principal
surveyed 15 anonymous students to determine how many minutes a day the students spend exercising. The results
from the 15 anonymous students are shown.
0 minutes; 40 minutes; 60 minutes; 30 minutes; 60 minutes
10 minutes; 45 minutes; 30 minutes; 300 minutes; 90 minutes;
30 minutes; 120 minutes; 60 minutes; 0 minutes; 20 minutes
Determine the following five values.
Min = 0
Q1 = 20
Med = 40
Q3 = 60
Max = 300
If you were the principal, would you be justified in purchasing new fitness equipment? Since 75% of the students
exercise for 60 minutes or less daily, and since the IQR is 40 minutes (60 – 20 = 40), we know that half of the
students surveyed exercise between 20 minutes and 60 minutes daily. This seems a reasonable amount of time
spent exercising, so the principal would be justified in purchasing the new equipment.
However, the principal needs to be careful. The value 300 appears to be a potential outlier.
Q3 + 1.5(IQR) = 60 + (1.5)(40) = 120.
The value 300 is greater than 120 so it is a potential outlier. If we delete it and calculate the five values, we get
the following values:
Min = 0
Q1 = 20
Q3 = 60
Max = 120
We still have 75% of the students exercising for 60 minutes or less daily and half of the students exercising
between 20 and 60 minutes a day. However, 15 students is a small sample and the principal should survey more
students to be sure of his survey results.

2.3 | Measures of the Center of the Data
The "center" of a data set is also a way of describing location. The two most widely used measures of the "center" of the
data are the mean (average) and the median. To calculate the mean weight of 50 people, add the 50 weights together and
divide by 50. Technically this is the arithmetic mean. We will discuss the geometric mean later. To find the median weight
of the 50 people, order the data and find the number that splits the data into two equal parts meaning an equal number of
observations on each side. The weight of 25 people are below this weight and 25 people are heavier than this weight. The
median is generally a better measure of the center when there are extreme values or outliers because it is not affected by the
precise numerical values of the outliers. The mean is the most common measure of the center.

72

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

NOTE
The words “mean” and “average” are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is
common practice. The technical term is “arithmetic mean” and “average” is technically a center location. Formally,
the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by mathematicians. However, in practice among nonstatisticians, “average" is commonly accepted for “arithmetic mean.”

When each value in the data set is not unique, the mean can be calculated by multiplying each distinct value by its frequency
and then dividing the sum by the total number of data values. The letter used to represent the sample mean is an x with a
–
bar over it (pronounced “x bar”): x .
The Greek letter μ (pronounced "mew") represents the population mean. One of the requirements for the sample mean to
be a good estimate of the population mean is for the sample taken to be truly random.
To see that both ways of calculating the mean are the same, consider the sample:
1; 1; 1; 2; 2; 3; 4; 4; 4; 4; 4
–
x = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 2.7
11
3(1)
+
2(2)
+ 1(3) + 5(4)
–x =
= 2.7
11

In the second calculation, the frequencies are 3, 2, 1, and 5.
You can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression n + 1 .

2

The letter n is the total number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of
the ordered data (ordered smallest to largest). If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle values added
together and divided by two after the data has been ordered. For example, if the total number of data values is 97, then

n + 1 = 97 + 1 = 49. The median is the 49th value in the ordered data. If the total number of data values is 100, then
2
2
n + 1 = 100 + 1 = 50.5. The median occurs midway between the 50th and 51st values. The location of the median and
2
2

the value of the median are not the same. The upper case letter M is often used to represent the median. The next example
illustrates the location of the median and the value of the median.

Example 2.24
AIDS data indicating the number of months a patient with AIDS lives after taking a new antibody drug are as
follows (smallest to largest):
3; 4; 8; 8; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 15; 16; 16; 17; 17; 18; 21; 22; 22; 24; 24; 25; 26; 26; 27; 27; 29; 29; 31; 32; 33;
33; 34; 34; 35; 37; 40; 44; 44; 47;
Calculate the mean and the median.
Solution 2.24
The calculation for the mean is:
–

x =

[3 + 4 + (8)(2) + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + (15)(2) + (16)(2) + ... + 35 + 37 + 40 + (44)(2) + 47]
= 23.6
40

To find the median, M, first use the formula for the location. The location is:

n + 1 = 40 + 1 = 20.5
2
2

Starting at the smallest value, the median is located between the 20 th and 21st values (the two 24s):
3; 4; 8; 8; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 15; 16; 16; 17; 17; 18; 21; 22; 22; 24; 24; 25; 26; 26; 27; 27; 29; 29; 31; 32; 33;
33; 34; 34; 35; 37; 40; 44; 44; 47;

73

M = 24 + 24 = 24
2

Example 2.25
Suppose that in a small town of 50 people, one person earns $5,000,000 per year and the other 49 each earn
$30,000. Which is the better measure of the "center": the mean or the median?
Solution 2.25

–x = 5, 000, 000 + 49(30, 000) = 129,400
50
M = 30,000
(There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns $5,000,000.)
The median is a better measure of the "center" than the mean because 49 of the values are 30,000 and one is
5,000,000. The 5,000,000 is an outlier. The 30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data.

Another measure of the center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one mode in a
data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data set with two modes is
called bimodal.

Example 2.26
Statistics exam scores for 20 students are as follows:
50; 53; 59; 59; 63; 63; 72; 72; 72; 72; 72; 76; 78; 81; 83; 84; 84; 84; 90; 93
Find the mode.
Solution 2.26
The most frequent score is 72, which occurs five times. Mode = 72.

Example 2.27
Five real estate exam scores are 430, 430, 480, 480, 495. The data set is bimodal because the scores 430 and 480
each occur twice.
When is the mode the best measure of the "center"? Consider a weight loss program that advertises a mean weight
loss of six pounds the first week of the program. The mode might indicate that most people lose two pounds the
first week, making the program less appealing.

NOTE
The mode can be calculated for qualitative data as well as for quantitative data. For example, if the data set
is: red, red, red, green, green, yellow, purple, black, blue, the mode is red.

Calculating the Arithmetic Mean of Grouped Frequency Tables
When only grouped data is available, you do not know the individual data values (we only know intervals and interval

74

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

frequencies); therefore, you cannot compute an exact mean for the data set. What we must do is estimate the actual mean
by calculating the mean of a frequency table. A frequency table is a data representation in which grouped data is displayed
along with the corresponding frequencies. To calculate the mean from a grouped frequency table we can apply the basic
definition of mean: mean =

data sum
We simply need to modify the definition to fit within the restrictions

of a frequency table.
Since we do not know the individual data values we can instead find the midpoint of each interval. The midpoint

This unit is here to remind you of material that you once studied and said at the time “I am sure that I will never need this!”
Here are the formulas for a population mean and the sample mean. The Greek letter μ is the symbol for the population
–
mean and x is the symbol for the sample mean. Both formulas have a mathematical symbol that tells us how to make
the calculations. It is called Sigma notation because the symbol is the Greek capital letter sigma: Σ. Like all mathematical
symbols it tells us what to do: just as the plus sign tells us to add and the x tells us to multiply. These are called mathematical
operators. The Σ symbol tells us to add a specific list of numbers.
Let’s say we have a sample of animals from the local animal shelter and we are interested in their average age. If we list
each value, or observation, in a column, you can give each one an index number. The first number will be number 1 and the
second number 2 and so on.

Table 2.27

Each observation represents a particular animal in the sample. Purr is animal number one and is a 9 year old cat, Toto is
animal number 2 and is a 1 year old puppy and so on.
To calculate the mean we are told by the formula to add up all these numbers, ages in this case, and then divide the sum by
10, the total number of animals in the sample.
Animal number one, the cat Purr, is designated as X1, animal number 2, Toto, is designated as X2 and so on through Dundee
who is animal number 10 and is designated as X10.
The i in the formula tells us which of the observations to add together. In this case it is X1 through X10 which is all of them.
We know which ones to add by the indexing notation, the i = 1 and the n or capital N for the population. For this example
the indexing notation would be i = 1 and because it is a sample we use a small n on the top of the Σ which would be 10.
The standard deviation requires the same mathematical operator and so it would be helpful to recall this knowledge from
your past.
The sum of the ages is found to be 78 and dividing by 10 gives us the sample mean age as 7.8 years.

2.5 | Geometric Mean
The mean (Arithmetic), median and mode are all measures of the “center” of the data, the “average”. They are all in their
own way trying to measure the “common” point within the data, that which is “normal”. In the case of the arithmetic mean
this is solved by finding the value from which all points are equal linear distances. We can imagine that all the data values
are combined through addition and then distributed back to each data point in equal amounts. The sum of all the values is
what is redistributed in equal amounts such that the total sum remains the same.
The geometric mean redistributes not the sum of the values but the product of multiplying all the individual values and then
redistributing them in equal portions such that the total product remains the same. This can be seen from the formula for the

~
x = ⎜ ∏ x i⎟ = x 1 * x 2 ∙∙∙x n = ⎛⎝x 1 * x 2 ∙∙∙x n⎞⎠ n
⎝i = 1 ⎠
where π is another mathematical operator, that tells us to multiply all the x i numbers in the same way capital Greek sigma
tells us to add all the x i numbers. Remember that a fractional exponent is calling for the nth root of the number thus an
exponent of 1/3 is the cube root of the number.
The geometric mean answers the question, "if all the quantities had the same value, what would that value have to be in
order to achieve the same product?” The geometric mean gets its name from the fact that when redistributed in this way
the sides form a geometric shape for which all sides have the same length. To see this, take the example of the numbers
10, 51.2 and 8. The geometric mean is the product of multiplying these three numbers together (4,096) and taking the cube

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

77

root because there are three numbers among which this product is to be distributed. Thus the geometric mean of these three
numbers is 16. This describes a cube 16x16x16 and has a volume of 4,096 units.
The geometric mean is relevant in Economics and Finance for dealing with growth: growth of markets, in investment,
population and other variables the growth in which there is an interest. Imagine that our box of 4,096 units (perhaps dollars)
is the value of an investment after three years and that the investment returns in percents were the three numbers in our
example. The geometric mean will provide us with the answer to the question, what is the average rate of return: 16 percent.
The arithmetic mean of these three numbers is 23.6 percent. The reason for this difference, 16 versus 23.6, is that the
arithmetic mean is additive and thus does not account for the interest on the interest, compound interest, embedded in the
investment growth process. The same issue arises when asking for the average rate of growth of a population or sales or
market penetration, etc., knowing the annual rates of growth. The formula for the geometric mean rate of return, or any
other growth rate, is:
1

r s = ⎛⎝x 1 * x 2 ∙∙∙x n⎞⎠ n - 1
Manipulating the formula for the geometric mean can also provide a calculation of the average rate of growth between two
periods knowing only the initial value a 0 and the ending value a n and the number of periods, n . The following formula
provides this information:
1
n

~
⎛a n ⎞
⎝a 0 ⎠ = x

Finally, we note that the formula for the geometric mean requires that all numbers be positive, greater than zero. The reason
of course is that the root of a negative number is undefined for use outside of mathematical theory. There are ways to
avoid this problem however. In the case of rates of return and other simple growth problems we can convert the negative
values to meaningful positive equivalent values. Imagine that the annual returns for the past three years are +12%, -8%, and
+2%. Using the decimal multiplier equivalents of 1.12, 0.92, and 1.02, allows us to compute a geometric mean of 1.0167.
Subtracting 1 from this value gives the geometric mean of +1.67% as a net rate of population growth (or financial return).
From this example we can see that the geometric mean provides us with this formula for calculating the geometric (mean)
rate of return for a series of annual rates of return:
~

rs = x - 1
~

where r s is average rate of return and x is the geometric mean of the returns during some number of time periods. Note
that the length of each time period must be the same.
As a general rule one should convert the percent values to its decimal equivalent multiplier. It is important to recognize
that when dealing with percents, the geometric mean of percent values does not equal the geometric mean of the decimal
multiplier equivalents and it is the decimal multiplier equivalent geometric mean that is relevant.

2.6 | Skewness and the Mean, Median, and Mode
Consider the following data set.
4; 5; 6; 6; 6; 7; 7; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8; 8; 8; 9; 10
This data set can be represented by following histogram. Each interval has width one, and each value is located in the middle
of an interval.

78

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

Figure 2.11

The histogram displays a symmetrical distribution of data. A distribution is symmetrical if a vertical line can be drawn at
some point in the histogram such that the shape to the left and the right of the vertical line are mirror images of each other.
The mean, the median, and the mode are each seven for these data. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean
and the median are the same. This example has one mode (unimodal), and the mode is the same as the mean and median.
In a symmetrical distribution that has two modes (bimodal), the two modes would be different from the mean and median.
The histogram for the data: 4; 5; 6; 6; 6; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8 is not symmetrical. The right-hand side seems "chopped off" compared
to the left side. A distribution of this type is called skewed to the left because it is pulled out to the left. We can formally
measure the skewness of a distribution just as we can mathematically measure the center weight of the data or its general
"speadness". The mathematical formula for skewness is: a 3 = ∑

⎛
⎝x i − x ⎠

. The greater the deviation from zero indicates

a greater degree of skewness. If the skewness is negative then the distribution is skewed left as in Figure 2.12. A positive
measure of skewness indicates right skewness such as Figure 2.13.

Figure 2.12

The mean is 6.3, the median is 6.5, and the mode is seven. Notice that the mean is less than the median, and they are
both less than the mode. The mean and the median both reflect the skewing, but the mean reflects it more so.
The histogram for the data: 6; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8; 8; 8; 9; 10, is also not symmetrical. It is skewed to the right.

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

79

Figure 2.13

The mean is 7.7, the median is 7.5, and the mode is seven. Of the three statistics, the mean is the largest, while the mode
is the smallest. Again, the mean reflects the skewing the most.
To summarize, generally if the distribution of data is skewed to the left, the mean is less than the median, which is often less
than the mode. If the distribution of data is skewed to the right, the mode is often less than the median, which is less than
the mean.
As with the mean, median and mode, and as we will see shortly, the variance, there are mathematical formulas that give us
precise measures of these characteristics of the distribution of the data. Again looking at the formula for skewness we see
that this is a relationship between the mean of the data and the individual observations cubed.

where s is the sample standard deviation of the data, X i , and x is the arithmetic mean and n is the sample size.
Formally the arithmetic mean is known as the first moment of the distribution. The second moment we will see is the
variance, and skewness is the third moment. The variance measures the squared differences of the data from the mean and
skewness measures the cubed differences of the data from the mean. While a variance can never be a negative number,
the measure of skewness can and this is how we determine if the data are skewed right of left. The skewness for a normal
distribution is zero, and any symmetric data should have skewness near zero. Negative values for the skewness indicate
data that are skewed left and positive values for the skewness indicate data that are skewed right. By skewed left, we mean
that the left tail is long relative to the right tail. Similarly, skewed right means that the right tail is long relative to the left
tail. The skewness characterizes the degree of asymmetry of a distribution around its mean. While the mean and standard
deviation are dimensional quantities (this is why we will take the square root of the variance ) that is, have the same units
as the measured quantities X i , the skewness is conventionally defined in such a way as to make it nondimensional. It is a
pure number that characterizes only the shape of the distribution. A positive value of skewness signifies a distribution with
an asymmetric tail extending out towards more positive X and a negative value signifies a distribution whose tail extends
out towards more negative X. A zero measure of skewness will indicate a symmetrical distribution.
Skewness and symmetry become important when we discuss probability distributions in later chapters.

2.7 | Measures of the Spread of the Data
An important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are concentrated
closely near the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common
measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is a number that measures how far data
values are from their mean.

80

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

The standard deviation
• provides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set, and
• can be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.

The standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set
The standard deviation is always positive or zero. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close
to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard deviation is larger when the data values are more spread out
from the mean, exhibiting more variation.
Suppose that we are studying the amount of time customers wait in line at the checkout at supermarket A and supermarket
B. The average wait time at both supermarkets is five minutes. At supermarket A, the standard deviation for the wait time is
two minutes; at supermarket B. The standard deviation for the wait time is four minutes.
Because supermarket B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more variation in the wait times at
supermarket B. Overall, wait times at supermarket B are more spread out from the average; wait times at supermarket A are
more concentrated near the average.

Calculating the Standard Deviation
If x is a number, then the difference "x minus the mean" is called its deviation. In a data set, there are as many deviations
as there are items in the data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. If the numbers belong to a
population, in symbols a deviation is x – μ. For sample data, in symbols a deviation is x – –x .
The procedure to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the numbers are the entire population or are data
from a sample. The calculations are similar, but not identical. Therefore the symbol used to represent the standard deviation
depends on whether it is calculated from a population or a sample. The lower case letter s represents the sample standard
deviation and the Greek letter σ (sigma, lower case) represents the population standard deviation. If the sample has the same
characteristics as the population, then s should be a good estimate of σ.
To calculate the standard deviation, we need to calculate the variance first. The variance is the average of the squares
of the deviations (the x – –x values for a sample, or the x – μ values for a population). The symbol σ2 represents the
population variance; the population standard deviation σ is the square root of the population variance. The symbol s2
represents the sample variance; the sample standard deviation s is the square root of the sample variance. You can think of
the standard deviation as a special average of the deviations. Formally, the variance is the second moment of the distribution
or the first moment around the mean. Remember that the mean is the first moment of the distribution.
If the numbers come from a census of the entire population and not a sample, when we calculate the average of the squared
deviations to find the variance, we divide by N, the number of items in the population. If the data are from a sample rather
than a population, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations, we divide by n – 1, one less than the number of
items in the sample.

• For the population standard deviation, the denominator is N, the number of items in the population.
In these formulas, f represents the frequency with which a value appears. For example, if a value appears once, f is one. If
a value appears three times in the data set or population, f is three. Two important observations concerning the variance and
standard deviation: the deviations are measured from the mean and the deviations are squared. In principle, the deviations
could be measured from any point, however, our interest is measurement from the center weight of the data, what is the
"normal" or most usual value of the observation. Later we will be trying to measure the "unusualness" of an observation
or a sample mean and thus we need a measure from the mean. The second observation is that the deviations are squared.
This does two things, first it makes the deviations all positive and second it changes the units of measurement from that
of the mean and the original observations. If the data are weights then the mean is measured in pounds, but the variance

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

81

is measured in pounds-squared. One reason to use the standard deviation is to return to the original units of measurement
by taking the square root of the variance. Further, when the deviations are squared it explodes their value. For example, a
deviation of 10 from the mean when squared is 100, but a deviation of 100 from the mean is 10,000. What this does is place
great weight on outliers when calculating the variance.

Types of Variability in Samples
When trying to study a population, a sample is often used, either for convenience or because it is not possible to access the
entire population. Variability is the term used to describe the differences that may occur in these outcomes. Common types
of variability include the following:
• Observational or measurement variability
• Natural variability
• Induced variability
• Sample variability
Here are some examples to describe each type of variability.
Example 1: Measurement variability
Measurement variability occurs when there are differences in the instruments used to measure or in the people using those
instruments. If we are gathering data on how long it takes for a ball to drop from a height by having students measure the
time of the drop with a stopwatch, we may experience measurement variability if the two stopwatches used were made by
different manufacturers: For example, one stopwatch measures to the nearest second, whereas the other one measures to the
nearest tenth of a second. We also may experience measurement variability because two different people are gathering the
data. Their reaction times in pressing the button on the stopwatch may differ; thus, the outcomes will vary accordingly. The
differences in outcomes may be affected by measurement variability.
Example 2: Natural variability
Natural variability arises from the differences that naturally occur because members of a population differ from each other.
For example, if we have two identical corn plants and we expose both plants to the same amount of water and sunlight,
they may still grow at different rates simply because they are two different corn plants. The difference in outcomes may be
explained by natural variability.
Example 3: Induced variability
Induced variability is the counterpart to natural variability; this occurs because we have artificially induced an element of
variation (that, by definition, was not present naturally): For example, we assign people to two different groups to study
memory, and we induce a variable in one group by limiting the amount of sleep they get. The difference in outcomes may
be affected by induced variability.
Example 4: Sample variability
Sample variability occurs when multiple random samples are taken from the same population. For example, if I conduct four
surveys of 50 people randomly selected from a given population, the differences in outcomes may be affected by sample
variability.

Example 2.29
In a fifth grade class, the teacher was interested in the average age and the sample standard deviation of the ages of
her students. The following data are the ages for a SAMPLE of n = 20 fifth grade students. The ages are rounded
to the nearest half year:
9; 9.5; 9.5; 10; 10; 10; 10; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11.5; 11.5; 11.5;

–x = 9 + 9.5(2) + 10(4) + 10.5(4) + 11(6) + 11.5(3) = 10.525
20
The average age is 10.53 years, rounded to two places.
The variance may be calculated by using a table. Then the standard deviation is calculated by taking the square
root of the variance. We will explain the parts of the table after calculating s.

20 − 1
The sample standard deviation s is equal to the square root of the sample variance:

s = 0.5125 = 0.715891, which is rounded to two decimal places, s = 0.72.

Explanation of the standard deviation calculation shown in the table
The deviations show how spread out the data are about the mean. The data value 11.5 is farther from the mean than is the
data value 11 which is indicated by the deviations 0.97 and 0.47. A positive deviation occurs when the data value is greater
than the mean, whereas a negative deviation occurs when the data value is less than the mean. The deviation is –1.525 for
the data value nine. If you add the deviations, the sum is always zero. (For Example 2.29, there are n = 20 deviations.)
So you cannot simply add the deviations to get the spread of the data. By squaring the deviations, you make them positive
numbers, and the sum will also be positive. The variance, then, is the average squared deviation. By squaring the deviations
we are placing an extreme penalty on observations that are far from the mean; these observations get greater weight in the
calculations of the variance. We will see later on that the variance (standard deviation) plays the critical role in determining
our conclusions in inferential statistics. We can begin now by using the standard deviation as a measure of "unusualness."
"How did you do on the test?" "Terrific! Two standard deviations above the mean." This, we will see, is an unusually good
exam grade.
The variance is a squared measure and does not have the same units as the data. Taking the square root solves the problem.
The standard deviation measures the spread in the same units as the data.
Notice that instead of dividing by n = 20, the calculation divided by n – 1 = 20 – 1 = 19 because the data is a sample. For
the sample variance, we divide by the sample size minus one (n – 1). Why not divide by n? The answer has to do with
the population variance. The sample variance is an estimate of the population variance. This estimate requires us to use
an estimate of the population mean rather than the actual population mean. Based on the theoretical mathematics that lies
behind these calculations, dividing by (n – 1) gives a better estimate of the population variance.
The standard deviation, s or σ, is either zero or larger than zero. Describing the data with reference to the spread is
called "variability". The variability in data depends upon the method by which the outcomes are obtained; for example, by
measuring or by random sampling. When the standard deviation is zero, there is no spread; that is, the all the data values are
equal to each other. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, and is larger when
the data values show more variation from the mean. When the standard deviation is a lot larger than zero, the data values
are very spread out about the mean; outliers can make s or σ very large.

Standard deviation of Grouped Frequency Tables
Recall that for grouped data we do not know individual data values, so we cannot describe the typical value of the data with
precision. In other words, we cannot find the exact mean, median, or mode. We can, however, determine the best estimate of
the measures of center by finding the mean of the grouped data with the formula: Mean o f Frequency Table =

∑ fm
∑f

where f = interval frequencies and m = interval midpoints.
Just as we could not find the exact mean, neither can we find the exact standard deviation. Remember that standard deviation
describes numerically the expected deviation a data value has from the mean. In simple English, the standard deviation
allows us to compare how “unusual” individual data is compared to the mean.

Table 2.30
For this data set, we have the mean, –x = 7.58 and the standard deviation, sx = 3.5. This means that a randomly
selected data value would be expected to be 3.5 units from the mean. If we look at the first class, we see that the
class midpoint is equal to one. This is almost two full standard deviations from the mean since 7.58 – 3.5 – 3.5 =
0.58. While the formula for calculating the standard deviation is not complicated, s x =

sx = sample standard deviation, –x = sample mean, the calculations are tedious. It is usually best to use
technology when performing the calculations.

Comparing Values from Different Data Sets
The standard deviation is useful when comparing data values that come from different data sets. If the data sets have
different means and standard deviations, then comparing the data values directly can be misleading.
• For each data value x, calculate how many standard deviations away from its mean the value is.
• Use the formula: x = mean + (#ofSTDEVs)(standard deviation); solve for #ofSTDEVs.
•

# o f STDEVs =

x – mean
standard deviation

• Compare the results of this calculation.
#ofSTDEVs is often called a "z-score"; we can use the symbol z. In symbols, the formulas become:

Table 2.32

Solution 2.32
For each student, determine how many standard deviations (#ofSTDEVs) his GPA is away from the average, for
his school. Pay careful attention to signs when comparing and interpreting the answer.

z = # of STDEVs =

value – mean = x - µ
σ
standard deviation

For John, z = # o f STDEVs = 2.85 – 3.0 = – 0.21

0.7

For Ali, z = # o f STDEVs = 77 − 80 = - 0.3

10

John has the better GPA when compared to his school because his GPA is 0.21 standard deviations below his
school's mean while Ali's GPA is 0.3 standard deviations below his school's mean.
John's z-score of –0.21 is higher than Ali's z-score of –0.3. For GPA, higher values are better, so we conclude that
John has the better GPA when compared to his school.

Table 2.33

The following lists give a few facts that provide a little more insight into what the standard deviation tells us about the
distribution of the data.
For ANY data set, no matter what the distribution of the data is:
• At least 75% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean.
• At least 89% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.
• At least 95% of the data is within 4.5 standard deviations of the mean.
• This is known as Chebyshev's Rule.
For data having a Normal Distribution, which we will examine in great detail later:
• Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean.
• Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean.
• More than 99% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.
• This is known as the Empirical Rule.
• It is important to note that this rule only applies when the shape of the distribution of the data is bell-shaped and
symmetric. We will learn more about this when studying the "Normal" or "Gaussian" probability distribution in later
chapters.

Coefficient of Variation
Another useful way to compare distributions besides simple comparisons of means or standard deviations is to adjust for
differences in the scale of the data being measured. Quite simply, a large variation in data with a large mean is different than
the same variation in data with a small mean. To adjust for the scale of the underlying data the Coefficient of Variation (CV)
has been developed. Mathematically:
¯
¯
CV = s¯ * 100 conditioned upon x ≠ 0, where s is the standard deviation of the data and x is the mean.
x

We can see that this measures the variability of the underlying data as a percentage of the mean value; the center weight of
the data set. This measure is useful in comparing risk where an adjustment is warranted because of differences in scale of
two data sets. In effect, the scale is changed to common scale, percentage differences, and allows direct comparison of the
two or more magnitudes of variation of different data sets.

KEY TERMS
Frequency the number of times a value of the data occurs
Frequency Table a data representation in which grouped data is displayed along with the corresponding frequencies
Histogram a graphical representation in x-y form of the distribution of data in a data set; x represents the data and y
represents the frequency, or relative frequency. The graph consists of contiguous rectangles.
Interquartile Range or IQR, is the range of the middle 50 percent of the data values; the IQR is found by subtracting
the first quartile from the third quartile.
Mean (arithmetic) a number that measures the central tendency of the data; a common name for mean is 'average.' The
¯

term 'mean' is a shortened form of 'arithmetic mean.' By definition, the mean for a sample (denoted by x ) is

–x = Sum of all values in the sample ,
Number of values in the sample
µ=

and

the

mean

for

a

population

(denoted

by

μ)

is

Sum of all values in the population
.
Number of values in the population

Mean (geometric) a measure of central tendency that provides a measure of average geometric growth over multiple
time periods.
Median a number that separates ordered data into halves; half the values are the same number or smaller than the median
and half the values are the same number or larger than the median. The median may or may not be part of the data.
Midpoint the mean of an interval in a frequency table
Mode the value that appears most frequently in a set of data
Outlier an observation that does not fit the rest of the data
Percentile a number that divides ordered data into hundredths; percentiles may or may not be part of the data. The
median of the data is the second quartile and the 50th percentile. The first and third quartiles are the 25th and the 75th
percentiles, respectively.
Quartiles the numbers that separate the data into quarters; quartiles may or may not be part of the data. The second
quartile is the median of the data.
Relative Frequency the ratio of the number of times a value of the data occurs in the set of all outcomes to the number
of all outcomes
Standard Deviation a number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how far data values are
from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and σ for population standard deviation.
Variance mean of the squared deviations from the mean, or the square of the standard deviation; for a set of data, a
deviation can be represented as x – –x where x is a value of the data and –x is the sample mean. The sample
variance is equal to the sum of the squares of the deviations divided by the difference of the sample size and one.

CHAPTER REVIEW
2.1 Display Data
A stem-and-leaf plot is a way to plot data and look at the distribution. In a stem-and-leaf plot, all data values within a
class are visible. The advantage in a stem-and-leaf plot is that all values are listed, unlike a histogram, which gives classes
of data values. A line graph is often used to represent a set of data values in which a quantity varies with time. These
graphs are useful for finding trends. That is, finding a general pattern in data sets including temperature, sales, employment,
company profit or cost over a period of time. A bar graph is a chart that uses either horizontal or vertical bars to show
comparisons among categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis

88

Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics

represents a discrete value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one (grouped bar graphs), and
others show the bars divided into subparts to show cumulative effect (stacked bar graphs). Bar graphs are especially useful
when categorical data is being used.
A histogram is a graphic version of a frequency distribution. The graph consists of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to
each other. The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values and the vertical scale represents frequencies.
The heights of the bars correspond to frequency values. Histograms are typically used for large, continuous, quantitative
data sets. A frequency polygon can also be used when graphing large data sets with data points that repeat. The data usually
goes on y-axis with the frequency being graphed on the x-axis. Time series graphs can be helpful when looking at large
amounts of data for one variable over a period of time.

2.2 Measures of the Location of the Data
The values that divide a rank-ordered set of data into 100 equal parts are called percentiles. Percentiles are used to
compare and interpret data. For example, an observation at the 50th percentile would be greater than 50 percent of the other
obeservations in the set. Quartiles divide data into quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is the 25th percentile,the second quartile
(Q2 or median) is 50th percentile, and the third quartile (Q3) is the the 75th percentile. The interquartile range, or IQR, is
the range of the middle 50 percent of the data values. The IQR is found by subtracting Q1 from Q3, and can help determine
outliers by using the following two expressions.
• Q3 + IQR(1.5)
• Q1 – IQR(1.5)

2.3 Measures of the Center of the Data
The mean and the median can be calculated to help you find the "center" of a data set. The mean is the best estimate for
the actual data set, but the median is the best measurement when a data set contains several outliers or extreme values. The
mode will tell you the most frequently occuring datum (or data) in your data set. The mean, median, and mode are extremely
helpful when you need to analyze your data, but if your data set consists of ranges which lack specific values, the mean
may seem impossible to calculate. However, the mean can be approximated if you add the lower boundary with the upper
boundary and divide by two to find the midpoint of each interval. Multiply each midpoint by the number of values found in
the corresponding range. Divide the sum of these values by the total number of data values in the set.

2.6 Skewness and the Mean, Median, and Mode
Looking at the distribution of data can reveal a lot about the relationship between the mean, the median, and the mode.
There are three types of distributions. A right (or positive) skewed distribution has a shape like Figure 2.12. A left (or
negative) skewed distribution has a shape like Figure 2.13. A symmetrical distrubtion looks like Figure 2.11.

2.7 Measures of the Spread of the Data
The standard deviation can help you calculate the spread of data. There are different equations to use if are calculating the
standard deviation of a sample or of a population.
• The Standard Deviation allows us to compare individual data or classes to the data set mean numerically.
• s =

∑ (x −

27 The manufacturer and the consumer would be upset. This is a large repair cost for the damages, compared to the other
cars in the sample. INTERPRETATION: 90% of the crash tested cars had damage repair costs of $1700 or less; only 10%
had damage repair costs of $1700 or more.

3 | PROBABILITY TOPICS

Introduction
It is often necessary to "guess" about the outcome of an event in order to make a decision. Politicians study polls to guess
their likelihood of winning an election. Teachers choose a particular course of study based on what they think students can
comprehend. Doctors choose the treatments needed for various diseases based on their assessment of likely results. You
may have visited a casino where people play games chosen because of the belief that the likelihood of winning is good. You
may have chosen your course of study based on the probable availability of jobs.
You have, more than likely, used probability. In fact, you probably have an intuitive sense of probability. Probability deals
with the chance of an event occurring. Whenever you weigh the odds of whether or not to do your homework or to study
for an exam, you are using probability. In this chapter, you will learn how to solve probability problems using a systematic
approach.

3.1 | Terminology
Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity.
An experiment is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions. If the result is not predetermined, then the
experiment is said to be a chance experiment. Flipping one fair coin twice is an example of an experiment.
A result of an experiment is called an outcome. The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes.
Three ways to represent a sample space are: to list the possible outcomes, to create a tree diagram, or to create a Venn
diagram. The uppercase letter S is used to denote the sample space. For example, if you flip one fair coin, S = {H, T} where
H = heads and T = tails are the outcomes.
An event is any combination of outcomes. Upper case letters like A and B represent events. For example, if the experiment
is to flip one fair coin, event A might be getting at most one head. The probability of an event A is written P(A).
The probability of any outcome is the long-term relative frequency of that outcome. Probabilities are between zero and
one, inclusive (that is, zero and one and all numbers between these values). P(A) = 0 means the event A can never happen.
P(A) = 1 means the event A always happens. P(A) = 0.5 means the event A is equally likely to occur or not to occur. For
example, if you flip one fair coin repeatedly (from 20 to 2,000 to 20,000 times) the relative frequency of heads approaches
0.5 (the probability of heads).
Equally likely means that each outcome of an experiment occurs with equal probability. For example, if you toss a fair,

134

Chapter 3 | Probability Topics

six-sided die, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is as likely to occur as any other face. If you toss a fair coin, a Head (H) and a
Tail (T) are equally likely to occur. If you randomly guess the answer to a true/false question on an exam, you are equally
likely to select a correct answer or an incorrect answer.
To calculate the probability of an event A when all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely, count the number
of outcomes for event A and divide by the total number of outcomes in the sample space. For example, if you toss a fair
dime and a fair nickel, the sample space is {HH, TH, HT, TT} where T = tails and H = heads. The sample space has four
outcomes. A = getting one head. There are two outcomes that meet this condition {HT, TH}, so P(A) = 2 = 0.5.

4

Suppose you roll one fair six-sided die, with the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} on its faces. Let event E = rolling a number that

is at least five. There are two outcomes {5, 6}. P(E) = 2 . If you were to roll the die only a few times, you would not be

6

surprised if your observed results did not match the probability. If you were to roll the die a very large number of times, you
would expect that, overall, 2 of the rolls would result in an outcome of "at least five". You would not expect exactly 2 .

6

2
as the number of
The long-term relative frequency of obtaining this result would approach the theoretical probability of
6
repetitions grows larger and larger.

This important characteristic of probability experiments is known as the law of large numbers which states that as the
number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the relative frequency obtained in the experiment tends to become
closer and closer to the theoretical probability. Even though the outcomes do not happen according to any set pattern or
order, overall, the long-term observed relative frequency will approach the theoretical probability. (The word empirical is
often used instead of the word observed.)
It is important to realize that in many situations, the outcomes are not equally likely. A coin or die may be unfair, or biased.
Two math professors in Europe had their statistics students test the Belgian one Euro coin and discovered that in 250 trials,
a head was obtained 56% of the time and a tail was obtained 44% of the time. The data seem to show that the coin is not a
fair coin; more repetitions would be helpful to draw a more accurate conclusion about such bias. Some dice may be biased.
Look at the dice in a game you have at home; the spots on each face are usually small holes carved out and then painted to
make the spots visible. Your dice may or may not be biased; it is possible that the outcomes may be affected by the slight
weight differences due to the different numbers of holes in the faces. Gambling casinos make a lot of money depending on
outcomes from rolling dice, so casino dice are made differently to eliminate bias. Casino dice have flat faces; the holes are
completely filled with paint having the same density as the material that the dice are made out of so that each face is equally
likely to occur. Later we will learn techniques to use to work with probabilities for events that are not equally likely.
" ∪ " Event: The Union
An outcome is in the event A ∪ B if the outcome is in A or is in B or is in both A and B. For example, let A = {1, 2, 3, 4,
5} and B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Notice that 4 and 5 are NOT listed twice.
" ∩ " Event: The Intersection
An outcome is in the event A ∩ B if the outcome is in both A and B at the same time. For example, let A and B be {1, 2,
3, 4, 5} and {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, respectively. Then A ∩ B = {4, 5}.
The complement of event A is denoted A′ (read "A prime"). A′ consists of all outcomes that are NOT in A. Notice that P(A)
+ P(A′) = 1. For example, let S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, A′ = {5, 6}. P(A) = 4 , P(A′) = 2 , and

6

P(A) + P(A′) = 4 + 2 = 1

6

6

The conditional probability of A given B is written P(A | B). P(A | B) is the probability that event A will occur given that the
event B has already occurred. A conditional reduces the sample space. We calculate the probability of A from the reduced
sample space B. The formula to calculate P(A | B) is P(A | B) =

P(A ∩ B)
where P(B) is greater than zero.
P(B)

For example, suppose we toss one fair, six-sided die. The sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let A = face is 2 or 3 and B =
face is even (2, 4, 6). To calculate P(A | B), we count the number of outcomes 2 or 3 in the sample space B = {2, 4, 6}. Then
we divide that by the number of outcomes B (rather than S).

We get the same result by using the formula. Remember that S has six outcomes.

Odds
The odds of an event presents the probability as a ratio of success to failure. This is common in various gambling formats.
Mathematically, the odds of an event can be defined as:

P(A)
1 − P(A)
where P(A) is the probability of success and of course 1 − P(A) is the probability of failure. Odds are always quoted as
"numerator to denominator," e.g. 2 to 1. Here the probability of winning is twice that of losing; thus, the probability of
winning is 0.66. A probability of winning of 0.60 would generate odds in favor of winning of 3 to 2. While the calculation
of odds can be useful in gambling venues in determining payoff amounts, it is not helpful for understanding probability or
statistical theory.
Understanding Terminology and Symbols
It is important to read each problem carefully to think about and understand what the events are. Understanding the wording
is the first very important step in solving probability problems. Reread the problem several times if necessary. Clearly
identify the event of interest. Determine whether there is a condition stated in the wording that would indicate that the
probability is conditional; carefully identify the condition, if any.

3.2 | Independent and Mutually Exclusive Events
Independent and mutually exclusive do not mean the same thing.

Independent Events
Two events are independent if one of the following are true:
•

P(A|B) = P(A)

•

P(B| A) = P(B)

•

P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)

Two events A and B are independent if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. For
example, the outcomes of two roles of a fair die are independent events. The outcome of the first roll does not change the
probability for the outcome of the second roll. To show two events are independent, you must show only one of the above
conditions. If two events are NOT independent, then we say that they are dependent.
Sampling may be done with replacement or without replacement.
• With replacement: If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the possibility
of being chosen more than once. When sampling is done with replacement, then events are considered to be
independent, meaning the result of the first pick will not change the probabilities for the second pick.
• Without replacement: When sampling is done without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen
only once. In this case, the probabilities for the second pick are affected by the result of the first pick. The events are
considered to be dependent or not independent.
If it is not known whether A and B are independent or dependent, assume they are dependent until you can show
otherwise.

Example 3.4
You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts and
spades. There are 13 cards in each suit consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack), Q (queen), K (king) of
that suit.
a. Sampling with replacement:
Suppose you pick three cards with replacement. The first card you pick out of the 52 cards is the Q of spades. You
put this card back, reshuffle the cards and pick a second card from the 52-card deck. It is the ten of clubs. You
put this card back, reshuffle the cards and pick a third card from the 52-card deck. This time, the card is the Q of
spades again. Your picks are {Q of spades, ten of clubs, Q of spades}. You have picked the Q of spades twice.
You pick each card from the 52-card deck.
b. Sampling without replacement:
Suppose you pick three cards without replacement. The first card you pick out of the 52 cards is the K of hearts.
You put this card aside and pick the second card from the 51 cards remaining in the deck. It is the three of
diamonds. You put this card aside and pick the third card from the remaining 50 cards in the deck. The third card
is the J of spades. Your picks are {K of hearts, three of diamonds, J of spades}. Because you have picked the
cards without replacement, you cannot pick the same card twice. The probability of picking the three of diamonds
is called a conditional probability because it is conditioned on what was picked first. This is true also of the
probability of picking the J of spades. The probability of picking the J of spades is actually conditioned on both
the previous picks.

3.4 You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts and

Three cards are picked at random.
a. Suppose you know that the picked cards are Q of spades, K of hearts and Q of spades. Can you decide if the
sampling was with or without replacement?
b. Suppose you know that the picked cards are Q of spades, K of hearts, and J of spades. Can you decide if the
sampling was with or without replacement?

Example 3.5
You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts, and

of that suit. S = spades, H = Hearts, D = Diamonds, C = Clubs.
a. Suppose you pick four cards, but do not put any cards back into the deck. Your cards are QS, 1D, 1C, QD.
b. Suppose you pick four cards and put each card back before you pick the next card. Your cards are KH, 7D,
6D, KH.
Which of a. or b. did you sample with replacement and which did you sample without replacement?
Solution 3.5
a. Without replacement; b. With replacement

Mutually Exclusive Events
A and B are mutually exclusive events if they cannot occur at the same time. Said another way, If A occurred then B cannot
occur and vise-a-versa. This means that A and B do not share any outcomes and P(A ∩ B) = 0 .
For example, suppose the sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, and C =
{7, 9}. A ∩ B = {4, 5}. P(A ∩ B) = 2 and is not equal to zero. Therefore, A and B are not mutually exclusive. A and

10

C do not have any numbers in common so P(A ∩ C) = 0 . Therefore, A and C are mutually exclusive.
If it is not known whether A and B are mutually exclusive, assume they are not until you can show otherwise. The
following examples illustrate these definitions and terms.

Example 3.6
Flip two fair coins. (This is an experiment.)
The sample space is {HH, HT, TH, TT} where T = tails and H = heads. The outcomes are HH, HT, TH, and
TT. The outcomes HT and TH are different. The HT means that the first coin showed heads and the second coin
showed tails. The TH means that the first coin showed tails and the second coin showed heads.
• Let A = the event of getting at most one tail. (At most one tail means zero or one tail.) Then A can be written
as {HH, HT, TH}. The outcome HH shows zero tails. HT and TH each show one tail.
• Let B = the event of getting all tails. B can be written as {TT}. B is the complement of A, so B = A′. Also,
P(A) + P(B) = P(A) + P(A′) = 1.
• The probabilities for A and for B are P(A) = 3 and P(B) = 1 .

4

4

• Let C = the event of getting all heads. C = {HH}. Since B = {TT}, P(B ∩ C) = 0 . B and C are mutually
exclusive. (B and C have no members in common because you cannot have all tails and all heads at the same
time.)
• Let D = event of getting more than one tail. D = {TT}. P(D) = 1

4

• Let E = event of getting a head on the first roll. (This implies you can get either a head or tail on the second
roll.) E = {HT, HH}. P(E) = 2

• Find the probability of getting at least one (one or two) tail in two flips. Let F = event of getting at least one
tail in two flips. F = {HT, TH, TT}. P(F) = 3

card.

Example 3.7
Flip two fair coins. Find the probabilities of the events.
a. Let F = the event of getting at most one tail (zero or one tail).
b. Let G = the event of getting two faces that are the same.
c. Let H = the event of getting a head on the first flip followed by a head or tail on the second flip.
d. Are F and G mutually exclusive?
e. Let J = the event of getting all tails. Are J and H mutually exclusive?
Solution 3.7
Look at the sample space in Example 3.6.
a. Zero (0) or one (1) tails occur when the outcomes HH, TH, HT show up. P(F) = 3

4

b. Two faces are the same if HH or TT show up. P(G) = 2

4

c. A head on the first flip followed by a head or tail on the second flip occurs when HH or HT show up. P(H)
= 2

4

d. F and G share HH so P(F ∩ G) is not equal to zero (0). F and G are not mutually exclusive.
e. Getting all tails occurs when tails shows up on both coins (TT). H’s outcomes are HH and HT.
J and H have nothing in common so P(J ∩ H) = 0. J and H are mutually exclusive.

3.7

A box has two balls, one white and one red. We select one ball, put it back in the box, and select a second ball
(sampling with replacement). Find the probability of the following events:
a. Let F = the event of getting the white ball twice.
b. Let G = the event of getting two balls of different colors.
c. Let H = the event of getting white on the first pick.
d. Are F and G mutually exclusive?
e. Are G and H mutually exclusive?

Example 3.8
Roll one fair, six-sided die. The sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let event A = a face is odd. Then A = {1, 3, 5}.
Let event B = a face is even. Then B = {2, 4, 6}.

Chapter 3 | Probability Topics

• Find the complement of A, A′. The complement of A, A′, is B because A and B together make up the sample
space. P(A) + P(B) = P(A) + P(A′) = 1. Also, P(A) = 3 and P(B) = 3 .

6

• Let event C = odd faces larger than two. Then C = {3, 5}. Let event D = all even faces smaller than five.
Then D = {2, 4}. P(C ∩ D) = 0 because you cannot have an odd and even face at the same time. Therefore,
C and D are mutually exclusive events.
• Let event E = all faces less than five. E = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Are C and E mutually exclusive events? (Answer yes or no.) Why or why not?
Solution 3.8

⎛
⎞
No. C = {3, 5} and E = {1, 2, 3, 4}. P⎝C ∩ E⎠ = 1 . To be mutually exclusive, P(C ∩ E) must be zero.

• Find P(C| A) . This is a conditional probability. Recall that the event C is {3, 5} and event A is {1, 3, 5}. To
find P(C| A) , find the probability of C using the sample space A. You have reduced the sample space from

⎛

the original sample space {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} to {1, 3, 5}. So, P⎝C A⎠ = 2 .

3.8 Let event A = learning Spanish. Let event B = learning German. Then A ∩ B =

learning Spanish and German.
Suppose P(A) = 0.4 and P(B) = 0.2 . P(A ∩ B) = 0.08 . Are events A and B independent? Hint: You must show
ONE of the following:
•

P(A|B) = P(A)

•

P(B| A) = P(B)

•

P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)

Example 3.9
Let event G = taking a math class. Let event H = taking a science class. Then, G ∩ H = taking a math class and
a science class. Suppose P(G) = 0.6, P(H) = 0.5 , and P(G ∩ H) = 0.3. Are G and H independent?
If G and H are independent, then you must show ONE of the following:
•

P(G|H) = P(G)

•

P(H |G) = P(H)

•

P(G ∩ H) = P(G)P(H)

NOTE
The choice you make depends on the information you have. You could choose any of the methods here
because you have the necessary information.

Since G and H are independent, knowing that a person is taking a science class does not change the chance that
he or she is taking a math class. If the two events had not been independent (that is, they are dependent) then
knowing that a person is taking a science class would change the chance he or she is taking math. For practice,
show that P(H |G) = P(H) to show that G and H are independent events.

Are the events of rooting for the away team and wearing blue independent? Are they mutually exclusive?

Example 3.12
In a particular college class, 60% of the students are female. Fifty percent of all students in the class have long
hair. Forty-five percent of the students are female and have long hair. Of the female students, 75% have long hair.
Let F be the event that a student is female. Let L be the event that a student has long hair. One student is picked
randomly. Are the events of being female and having long hair independent?
• The following probabilities are given in this example:
•

P(F)=0.60; P(L)=0.50

•

P(F ∩ L) = 0.45

•

P(L|F) = 0.75

NOTE
The choice you make depends on the information you have. You could use the first or last condition on
the list for this example. You do not know P(F|L) yet, so you cannot use the second condition.

Solution 1
Check

whether

P(F ∩ L) = P(F)P(L) .

We

are

given

that

P(F ∩ L) = 0.45 ,

but

P(F)P(L) = (0.60)(0.50) = 0.30 . The events of being female and having long hair are not independent because
P(F ∩ L) does not equal P(F)P(L) .
Solution 2
Check whether P(L|F) equals P(L) . We are given that P(L|F) = 0.75 , but P(L) = 0.50 ; they are not equal.
The events of being female and having long hair are not independent.
Interpretation of Results
The events of being female and having long hair are not independent; knowing that a student is female changes
the probability that a student has long hair.

3.3 | Two Basic Rules of Probability
When calculating probability, there are two rules to consider when determining if two events are independent or dependent
and if they are mutually exclusive or not.

The Multiplication Rule
If A and B are two events defined on a sample space, then: P(A ∩ B) = P(B)P(A|B) . We can think of the intersection
symbol as substituting for the word "and".

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11776/1.33

Chapter 3 | Probability Topics

147

⎛

|

⎞

This rule may also be written as: P⎝A B⎠ =

P(A ∩ B)
P(B)

This equation is read as the probability of A given B equals the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B.
If A and B are independent, then P(A|B) = P(A) . Then P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B)P(B) becomes P(A ∩ B) = P(A)(B)
because the P(A|B) = P(A) if A and B are independent.

One easy way to remember the multiplication rule is that the word "and" means that the event has to satisfy two conditions.
For example the name drawn from the class roster is to be both a female and a sophomore. It is harder to satisfy two
conditions than only one and of course when we multiply fractions the result is always smaller. This reflects the increasing
difficulty of satisfying two conditions.

The Addition Rule
If A and B are defined on a sample space, then: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) . We can think of the union symbol
substituting for the word "or". The reason we subtract the intersection of A and B is to keep from double counting elements
that are in both A and B.
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A ∩ B) = 0 . Then P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) becomes

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) .

Example 3.14
Klaus is trying to choose where to go on vacation. His two choices are: A = New Zealand and B = Alaska
• Klaus can only afford one vacation. The probability that he chooses A is P(A) = 0.6 and the probability that
he chooses B is P(B) = 0.35.
•

P(A ∩ B) = 0 because Klaus can only afford to take one vacation

• Therefore,

the

probability

that

he

chooses

either

New

Zealand

or

Alaska

is

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.6 + 0.35 = 0.95 . Note that the probability that he does not choose to go

anywhere on vacation must be 0.05.

Example 3.15
Carlos plays college soccer. He makes a goal 65% of the time he shoots. Carlos is going to attempt two goals in a
row in the next game. A = the event Carlos is successful on his first attempt. P(A) = 0.65. B = the event Carlos is
successful on his second attempt. P(B) = 0.65. Carlos tends to shoot in streaks. The probability that he makes the
second goal | that he made the first goal is 0.90.
a. What is the probability that he makes both goals?
Solution 3.15
a. The problem is asking you to find P(A ∩ B) = P(B ∩ A) . Since P(B | A) = 0.90: P(B ∩ A) = P(B | A)
P(A) = (0.90)(0.65) = 0.585
Carlos makes the first and second goals with probability 0.585.
b. What is the probability that Carlos makes either the first goal or the second goal?
Solution 3.15
b. The problem is asking you to find P(A ∪ B).

148

Chapter 3 | Probability Topics

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.65 + 0.65 - 0.585 = 0.715
Carlos makes either the first goal or the second goal with probability 0.715.
c. Are A and B independent?
Solution 3.15
c. No, they are not, because P(B ∩ A) = 0.585.
P(B)P(A) = (0.65)(0.65) = 0.423
0.423 ≠ 0.585 = P(B ∩ A)
So, P(B ∩ A) is not equal to P(B)P(A).
d. Are A and B mutually exclusive?
Solution 3.15
d. No, they are not because P(A ∩ B) = 0.585.
To be mutually exclusive, P(A ∩ B) must equal zero.

= 0.75. The probability that Helen makes the second free throw given that she made the first is 0.85. What is the
probability that Helen makes both free throws?

d. What is the probability that a member is an advanced swimmer and an intermediate swimmer? Are being an
advanced swimmer and an intermediate swimmer mutually exclusive? Why or why not?
Solution 3.16
d. P(advanced ∩ intermediate) = 0, so these are mutually exclusive events. A swimmer cannot be an advanced
swimmer and an intermediate swimmer at the same time.
e. Are being a novice swimmer and practicing four times a week independent events? Why or why not?
Solution 3.16
e. No, these are not independent events.
P(novice ∩ practices four times per week) = 0.0667
P(novice)P(practices four times per week) = 0.0996
0.0667 ≠ 0.0996

Example 3.18
Studies show that about one woman in seven (approximately 14.3%) who live to be 90 will develop breast cancer.
Suppose that of those women who develop breast cancer, a test is negative 2% of the time. Also suppose that in
the general population of women, the test for breast cancer is negative about 85% of the time. Let B = woman
develops breast cancer and let N = tests negative. Suppose one woman is selected at random.
a. What is the probability that the woman develops breast cancer? What is the probability that woman tests
negative?
Solution 3.18
a. P(B) = 0.143; P(N) = 0.85
b. Given that the woman has breast cancer, what is the probability that she tests negative?
Solution 3.18
b. P(N | B) = 0.02
c. What is the probability that the woman has breast cancer AND tests negative?
Solution 3.18
c. P(B ∩ N) = P(B)P(N | B) = (0.143)(0.02) = 0.0029
d. What is the probability that the woman has breast cancer or tests negative?
Solution 3.18
d. P(B ∪ N) = P(B) + P(N) - P(B ∩ N) = 0.143 + 0.85 - 0.0029 = 0.9901
e. Are having breast cancer and testing negative independent events?
Solution 3.18
e. No. P(N) = 0.85; P(N | B) = 0.02. So, P(N | B) does not equal P(N).
f. Are having breast cancer and testing negative mutually exclusive?
Solution 3.18
f. No. P(B ∩ N) = 0.0029. For B and N to be mutually exclusive, P(B ∩ N) must be zero.

Contingency Tables
A contingency table provides a way of portraying data that can facilitate calculating probabilities. The table helps in
determining conditional probabilities quite easily. The table displays sample values in relation to two different variables that
may be dependent or contingent on one another. Later on, we will use contingency tables again, but in another manner.

Tree Diagrams
Sometimes, when the probability problems are complex, it can be helpful to graph the situation. Tree diagrams can be used
to visualize and solve conditional probabilities.

Tree Diagrams
A tree diagram is a special type of graph used to determine the outcomes of an experiment. It consists of "branches" that
are labeled with either frequencies or probabilities. Tree diagrams can make some probability problems easier to visualize
and solve. The following example illustrates how to use a tree diagram.

Example 3.24
In an urn, there are 11 balls. Three balls are red (R) and eight balls are blue (B). Draw two balls, one at a time,
with replacement. "With replacement" means that you put the first ball back in the urn before you select the
second ball. The tree diagram using frequencies that show all the possible outcomes follows.

158

Chapter 3 | Probability Topics

Figure 3.2 Total = 64 + 24 + 24 + 9 = 121

The first set of branches represents the first draw. The second set of branches represents the second draw. Each of
the outcomes is distinct. In fact, we can list each red ball as R1, R2, and R3 and each blue ball as B1, B2, B3, B4,
B5, B6, B7, and B8. Then the nine RR outcomes can be written as:
R1R1; R1R2; R1R3; R2R1; R2R2; R2R3; R3R1; R3R2; R3R3
The other outcomes are similar.
There are a total of 11 balls in the urn. Draw two balls, one at a time, with replacement. There are 11(11) = 121
outcomes, the size of the sample space.

This problem is a conditional one. The sample space has been reduced to those outcomes that already have a blue
on the first draw. There are 24 + 64 = 88 possible outcomes (24 BR and 64 BB). Twenty-four of the 88 possible

outcomes are BR. 24 = 3 .

There are 9 + 24 outcomes that have R on the first draw (9 RR and 24 RB). The sample space is then 9 + 24 = 33.
24 of the 33 outcomes have B on the second draw. The probability is then 24 .

3.24 In a standard deck, there are 52 cards. 12 cards are face cards (event F) and 40 cards are not face cards (event N).

Using the tree diagram, calculate P(FF).

Example 3.25
An urn has three red marbles and eight blue marbles in it. Draw two marbles, one at a time, this time without
replacement, from the urn. "Without replacement" means that you do not put the first ball back before you
select the second marble. Following is a tree diagram for this situation. The branches are labeled with probabilities
instead of frequencies. The numbers at the ends of the branches are calculated by multiplying the numbers on the
⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞

NOTE
If you draw a red on the first draw from the three red possibilities, there are two red marbles left to draw on
the second draw. You do not put back or replace the first marble after you have drawn it. You draw without
replacement, so that on the second draw there are ten marbles left in the urn.

Venn Diagrams
A Venn diagram is a picture that represents the outcomes of an experiment. It generally consists of a box that represents the
sample space S together with circles or ovals. The circles or ovals represent events. Venn diagrams also help us to convert
common English words into mathematical terms that help add precision.
Venn diagrams are named for their inventor, John Venn, a mathematics professor at Cambridge and an Anglican minister.
His main work was conducted during the late 1870's and gave rise to a whole branch of mathematics and a new way to
approach issues of logic. We will develop the probability rules just covered using this powerful way to demonstrate the
probability postulates including the Addition Rule, Multiplication Rule, Complement Rule, Independence, and Conditional

Example 3.27
Suppose an experiment has the outcomes 1, 2, 3, ... , 12 where each outcome has an equal chance of occurring.
Let event A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and event B = {6, 7, 8, 9}. Then A intersect B = A ∩ B = {6} and A union B =

A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. . The Venn diagram is as follows:

Figure 3.6

Figure 3.6 shows the most basic relationship among these numbers. First, the numbers are in groups called sets; set A
and set B. Some number are in both sets; we say in set A ∩ in set B. The English word "and" means inclusive, meaning
having the characteristics of both A and B, or in this case, being a part of both A and B. This condition is called the
INTERSECTION of the two sets. All members that are part of both sets constitute the intersection of the two sets. The
intersection is written as A ∩ B where ∩ is the mathematical symbol for intersection. The statement A ∩ B is read as
"A intersect B." You can remember this by thinking of the intersection of two streets.
There are also those numbers that form a group that, for membership, the number must be in either one or the other group.
The number does not have to be in BOTH groups, but instead only in either one of the two. These numbers are called the
UNION of the two sets and in this case they are the numbers 1-5 (from A exclusively), 7-9 (from set B exclusively) and also
6, which is in both sets A and B. The symbol for the UNION is ∪ , thus A ∪ B = numbers 1-9, but excludes number 10,
11, and 12. The values 10, 11, and 12 are part of the universe, but are not in either of the two sets.
Translating the English word "AND" into the mathematical logic symbol ∩ , intersection, and the word "OR" into the
mathematical symbol ∪ , union, provides a very precise way to discuss the issues of probability and logic. The general
terminology for the three areas of the Venn diagram in Figure 3.6 is shown in Figure 3.7.

3.27

Suppose an experiment has outcomes black, white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, where each
outcome has an equal chance of occurring. Let event C = {green, blue, purple} and event P = {red, yellow, blue}.
Then C ∩ P = {blue} and C ∪ P = {green, blue, purple, red, yellow} . Draw a Venn diagram representing this
situation.

Example 3.28
Flip two fair coins. Let A = tails on the first coin. Let B = tails on the second coin. Then A = {TT, TH} and B =
{TT, HT}. Therefore, A ∩ B = {TT} . A ∪ B = {TH, TT, HT} .
The sample space when you flip two fair coins is X = {HH, HT, TH, TT}. The outcome HH is in NEITHER A
NOR B. The Venn diagram is as follows:

A = {2, 3, 5} and B = {1, 3, 5}. Therefore, A ∩ B = {3, 5} . A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5} . The sample space for rolling a

fair die is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Draw a Venn diagram representing this situation.

In order to solve Example 3.30 we had to draw upon the concept of conditional probability from the previous section.
There we used tree diagrams to track the changes in the probabilities, because the sample space changed as we drew
without replacement. In short, conditional probability is the chance that something will happen given that some other event
has already happened. Put another way, the probability that something will happen conditioned upon the situation that
something else is also true. In Example 3.30 the probability P(C | PT) is the conditional probability that the randomly
drawn student is a member of the club, conditioned upon the fact that the student also is working part time. This allows us
to see the relationship between Venn diagrams and the probability postulates.

Example 3.31
A set of 20 German Shepherd dogs is observed. 12 are male, 8 are female, 10 have some brown coloring, and 5
have some white sections of fur. Answer the following using Venn Diagrams.
Draw a Venn diagram simply showing the sets of male and female dogs.
Solution 3.31
The Venn diagram below demonstrates the situation of mutually exclusive events where the outcomes are
independent events. If a dog cannot be both male and female, then there is no intersection. Being male precludes
being female and being female precludes being male: in this case, the characteristic gender is therefore mutually
exclusive. A Venn diagram shows this as two sets with no intersection. The intersection is said to be the null set
using the mathematical symbol ∅.

Figure 3.10

Draw a second Venn diagram illustrating that 10 of the male dogs have brown coloring.
Solution 3.31
The Venn diagram below shows the overlap between male and brown where the number 10 is placed in it.
This represents Male ∩ Brown : both male and brown. This is the intersection of these two characteristics. To
get the union of Male and Brown, then it is simply the two circled areas minus the overlap. In proper terms,
Male ∪ Brown = Male + Brown − Male ∩ Brown will give us the number of dogs in the union of these two

sets. If we did not subtract the intersection, we would have double counted some of the dogs.

Now draw a situation depicting a scenario in which the non-shaded region represents "No white fur and female,"
or White fur′ ∩ Female. the prime above "fur" indicates "not white fur." The prime above a set means not in

The Addition Rule of Probability
We met the addition rule earlier but without the help of Venn diagrams. Venn diagrams help visualize the counting process
that is inherent in the calculation of probability. To restate the Addition Rule of Probability:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)

170

Chapter 3 | Probability Topics

Remember that probability is simply the proportion of the objects we are interested in relative to the total number of objects.
This is why we can see the usefulness of the Venn diagrams. Example 3.31 shows how we can use Venn diagrams to count
the number of dogs in the union of brown and male by reminding us to subtract the intersection of brown and male. We can
see the effect of this directly on probabilities in the addition rule.

Example 3.32
Let's sample 50 students who are in a statistics class. 20 are freshmen and 30 are sophomores. 15 students get a
"B" in the course, and 5 students both get a "B" and are freshmen.
Find the probability of selecting a student who either earns a "B" OR is a freshmen. We are translating the word
OR to the mathematical symbol for the addition rule, which is the union of the two sets.
Solution 3.32
We know that there are 50 students in our sample, so we know the denominator of our fraction to give us
probability. We need only to find the number of students that meet the characteristics we are interested in, i.e. any
freshman and any student who earned a grade of "B." With the Addition Rule of probability, we can skip directly
to probabilities.
Let "A" = the number of freshmen, and let "B" = the grade of "B." Below we can see the process for using Venn
diagrams to solve this.
⎞
⎛ ⎞
⎛ ⎞

The P⎝A⎠ = 20 = 0.40 , P⎝B⎠ = 15 = 0.30 , and P⎝A ∩ B⎠ = 5 = 0.10 .

50

Therefore, P(A ∩ B) = 0.40 + 0.30 − 0.10 = 0.60 .

Figure 3.13

If two events are mutually exclusive, then, like the example where we diagram the male and female dogs, the
addition rule is simplified to just P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − 0 . This is true because, as we saw earlier, the
union of mutually exclusive events is the null set, ∅. The diagrams below demonstrate this.

The Multiplication Rule of Probability
Restating the Multiplication Rule of Probability using the notation of Venn diagrams, we have:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) ⋅ P(B)
The multiplication rule can be modified with a bit of algebra into the following conditional rule. Then Venn diagrams can
then be used to demonstrate the process.
The conditional rule: P(A|B) =

P(A ∩ B)
P(B)

Using the same facts from Example 3.32 above, find the probability that someone will earn a "B" if they are a "freshman."

P(A|B) = 0.10 = 1
0.30 3

172

Chapter 3 | Probability Topics

Figure 3.15

The multiplication rule must also be altered if the two events are independent. Independent events are defined as a situation
where the conditional probability is simply the probability of the event of interest. Formally, independence of events is
defined as P(A|B) = P(A) or P(B| A) = P(B) . When flipping coins, the outcome of the second flip is independent of the
outcome of the first flip; coins do not have memory. The Multiplication Rule of Probability for independent events thus
becomes:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B)
One easy way to remember this is to consider what we mean by the word "and." We see that the Multiplication Rule has
translated the word "and" to the Venn notation for intersection. Therefore, the outcome must meet the two conditions of
freshmen and grade of "B" in the above example. It is harder, less probable, to meet two conditions than just one or some
other one. We can attempt to see the logic of the Multiplication Rule of probability due to the fact that fractions multiplied
times each other become smaller.
The development of the Rules of Probability with the use of Venn diagrams can be shown to help as we wish to calculate
probabilities from data arranged in a contingency table.

Example 3.33
Table 3.11 is from a sample of 200 people who were asked how much education they completed. The columns
represent the highest education they completed, and the rows separate the individuals by male and female.

Now, we can use this table to answer probability questions. The following examples are designed to help
understand the format above while connecting the knowledge to both Venn diagrams and the probability rules.
What is the probability that a selected person both finished college and is female?
Solution 3.33
This is a simple task of finding the value where the two characteristics intersect on the table, and then applying
the postulate of probability, which states that the probability of an event is the proportion of outcomes that match
the event in which we are interested as a proportion of all total possible outcomes.

P(College Grad ∩ Female) = 30 = 0.15

200

What is the probability of selecting either a female or someone who finished college?
Solution 3.33
This task involves the use of the addition rule to solve for this probability.
P(College Grad ∪ Female) = P(F) + P(CG)− P(F ∩ CG)
P(College Grad ∪ Female) = 80 + 90 − 30 = 140 = 0.70

What is the probability of selecting a high school graduate if we only select from the group of males?

Can we conclude that the level of education attained by these 200 people is independent of the gender of the
person?
Solution 3.33
There are two ways to approach this test. The first method seeks to test if the intersection of two events equals the
product of the events separately remembering that if two events are independent than P(A)*P(B) = P(A ∩ B).
For simplicity's sake, we can use calculated values from above.
Does P(College Grad ∩ Female) = P(CG) ⋅ P(F)?

30 ≠ 90 ⋅ 80 because 0.15 ≠ 0.18.
200 200 200
Therefore, gender and education here are not independent.
The second method is to test if the conditional probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A. Again for
simplicity, we can use an already calculated value from above.
Does P(HS Grad | Male) = P(HS Grad)?

15 ≠ 27 because 0.125 ≠ 0.135.
120 200
Therefore, again gender and education here are not independent.

KEY TERMS
Conditional Probability the likelihood that an event will occur given that another event has already occurred
Contingency Table the method of displaying a frequency distribution as a table with rows and columns to show how
two variables may be dependent (contingent) upon each other; the table provides an easy way to calculate
conditional probabilities.
Dependent Events If two events are NOT independent, then we say that they are dependent.
Equally Likely Each outcome of an experiment has the same probability.
Event a subset of the set of all outcomes of an experiment; the set of all outcomes of an experiment is called a sample
space and is usually denoted by S. An event is an arbitrary subset in S. It can contain one outcome, two outcomes,
no outcomes (empty subset), the entire sample space, and the like. Standard notations for events are capital letters
such as A, B, C, and so on.
Experiment a planned activity carried out under controlled conditions
Independent Events The occurrence of one event has no effect on the probability of the occurrence of another event.
Events A and B are independent if one of the following is true:
1. P(A|B) = P(A)
2. P(B|A) = P(B)
3. P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)
Mutually Exclusive Two events are mutually exclusive if the probability that they both happen at the same time is
zero. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A ∩ B) = 0.
Outcome a particular result of an experiment
Probability a number between zero and one, inclusive, that gives the likelihood that a specific event will occur; the
foundation of statistics is given by the following 3 axioms (by A.N. Kolmogorov, 1930’s): Let S denote the sample
space and A and B are two events in S. Then:
• 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
• If A and B are any two mutually exclusive events, then P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).
• P(S) = 1
Sample Space the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
Sampling with Replacement If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the
possibility of being chosen more than once.
Sampling without Replacement When sampling is done without replacement, each member of a population may be
chosen only once.
The Complement Event The complement of event A consists of all outcomes that are NOT in A.
The Conditional Probability of A | B P(A | B) is the probability that event A will occur given that the event B has
already occurred.
The Intersection: the ∩ Event An outcome is in the event A ∩ B if the outcome is in both A ∩ B at the same
time.
The Union: the ∪ Event An outcome is in the event A ∪ B if the outcome is in A or is in B or is in both A and B.
Tree Diagram the useful visual representation of a sample space and events in the form of a “tree” with branches
marked by possible outcomes together with associated probabilities (frequencies, relative frequencies)

CHAPTER REVIEW
3.1 Terminology
In this module we learned the basic terminology of probability. The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called
the sample space. Events are subsets of the sample space, and they are assigned a probability that is a number between zero
and one, inclusive.

3.2 Independent and Mutually Exclusive Events
Two events A and B are independent if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. If two
events are not independent, then we say that they are dependent.
In sampling with replacement, each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility
of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each
member of a population may be chosen only once, and the events are considered not to be independent. When events do not
share outcomes, they are mutually exclusive of each other.

3.3 Two Basic Rules of Probability
The multiplication rule and the addition rule are used for computing the probability of A and B, as well as the probability of
A or B for two given events A, B defined on the sample space. In sampling with replacement each member of a population is
replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered
to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once, and the
events are considered to be not independent. The events A and B are mutually exclusive events when they do not have any
outcomes in common.

3.4 Contingency Tables and Probability Trees
There are several tools you can use to help organize and sort data when calculating probabilities. Contingency tables help
display data and are particularly useful when calculating probabilites that have multiple dependent variables.
A tree diagram use branches to show the different outcomes of experiments and makes complex probability questions easy
to visualize.

3.5 Venn Diagrams
A Venn diagram is a picture that represents the outcomes of an experiment. It generally consists of a box that represents the
sample space S or universe of the objects of interest together with circles or ovals. The circles or ovals represent groups of
events called sets. A Venn diagram is especially helpful for visualizing the ∪ event, the ∩ event, and the complement of
an event and for understanding conditional probabilities. A Venn diagram is especially helpful for visualizing an Intersection
of two events, a Union of two events, or a Complement of one event. A system of Venn diagrams can also help to understand
Conditional probabilities. Venn diagrams connect the brain and eyes by matching the literal arithmetic to a picture. It is
important to note that more than one Venn diagram is needed to solve the probability rule formulas introduced in Section
3.3.

Then he randomly selects another cookie and eats it. (How many cookies did he take?)
a. Draw the tree that represents the possibilities for the cookie selections. Write the probabilities along each branch
of the tree.
b. Are the probabilities for the flavor of the SECOND cookie that Miguel selects independent of his first selection?
Explain.
c. For each complete path through the tree, write the event it represents and find the probabilities.
d. Let S be the event that both cookies selected were the same flavor. Find P(S).
e. Let T be the event that the cookies selected were different flavors. Find P(T) by two different methods: by using
the complement rule and by using the branches of the tree. Your answers should be the same with both methods.

4 | DISCRETE RANDOM
VARIABLES

Figure 4.1 You can use probability and discrete random variables to calculate the likelihood of lightning striking the
ground five times during a half-hour thunderstorm. (Credit: Leszek Leszczynski)

Introduction
A student takes a ten-question, true-false quiz. Because the student had such a busy schedule, he or she could not study and
guesses randomly at each answer. What is the probability of the student passing the test with at least a 70%?
Small companies might be interested in the number of long-distance phone calls their employees make during the peak time
of the day. Suppose the historical average is 20 calls. What is the probability that the employees make more than 20 longdistance phone calls during the peak time?
These two examples illustrate two different types of probability problems involving discrete random variables. Recall that
discrete data are data that you can count, that is, the random variable can only take on whole number values. A random
variable describes the outcomes of a statistical experiment in words. The values of a random variable can vary with each
repetition of an experiment, often called a trial.

Random Variable Notation
The upper case letter X denotes a random variable. Lower case letters like x or y denote the value of a random variable. If X
is a random variable, then X is written in words, and x is given as a number.
For example, let X = the number of heads you get when you toss three fair coins. The sample space for the toss of three fair
coins is TTT; THH; HTH; HHT; HTT; THT; TTH; HHH. Then, x = 0, 1, 2, 3. X is in words and x is a number. Notice that
for this example, the x values are countable outcomes. Because you can count the possible values as whole numbers that X
can take on and the outcomes are random (the x values 0, 1, 2, 3), X is a discrete random variable.

Probability Density Functions (PDF) for a Random Variable
A probability density function or probability distribution function has two characteristics:
1. Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive.
2. The sum of the probabilities is one.
A probability density function is a mathematical formula that calculates probabilities for specific types of events, what
we have been calling experiments. There is a sort of magic to a probability density function (Pdf) partially because the
same formula often describes very different types of events. For example, the binomial Pdf will calculate probabilities for
flipping coins, yes/no questions on an exam, opinions of voters in an up or down opinion poll, indeed any binary event.
Other probability density functions will provide probabilities for the time until a part will fail, when a customer will arrive
at the turnpike booth, the number of telephone calls arriving at a central switchboard, the growth rate of a bacterium, and on
and on. There are whole families of probability density functions that are used in a wide variety of applications, including
medicine, business and finance, physics and engineering, among others.
For our needs here we will concentrate on only a few probability density functions as we develop the tools of inferential
statistics.

Counting Formulas and the Combinational Formula
To repeat, the probability of event A , P(A), is simply the number of ways the experiment will result in A, relative to the
total number of possible outcomes of the experiment.
As an equation this is:

P(A) =

number of ways to get A
Total number of possible outcomes

When we looked at the sample space for flipping 3 coins we could easily write the full sample space and thus could easily
count the number of events that met our desired result, e.g. x = 1 , where X is the random variable defined as the number of
heads.
As we have larger numbers of items in the sample space, such as a full deck of 52 cards, the ability to write out the sample
space becomes impossible.
We see that probabilities are nothing more than counting the events in each group we are interested in and dividing by the
number of elements in the universe, or sample space. This is easy enough if we are counting sophomores in a Stat class,
but in more complicated cases listing all the possible outcomes may take a life time. There are, for example, 36 possible
outcomes from throwing just two six-sided dice where the random variable is the sum of the number of spots on the upfacing sides. If there were four dice then the total number of possible outcomes would become 1,296. There are more than
2.5 MILLION possible 5 card poker hands in a standard deck of 52 cards. Obviously keeping track of all these possibilities
and counting them to get at a single probability would be tedious at best.
An alternative to listing the complete sample space and counting the number of elements we are interested in, is to skip the
step of listing the sample space, and simply figuring out the number of elements in it and doing the appropriate division. If
we are after a probability we really do not need to see each and every element in the sample space, we only need to know
how many elements are there. Counting formulas were invented to do just this. They tell us the number of unordered subsets
of a certain size that can be created from a set of unique elements. By unordered it is meant that, for example, when dealing
cards, it does not matter if you got {ace, ace, ace, ace, king} or {king, ace, ace, ace, ace} or {ace, king, ace, ace, ace} and
so on. Each of these subsets are the same because they each have 4 aces and one king.

Combinational Formula
⎛n⎞
⎝x⎠

= n Cx =

n!
x !(n - x) !

This is the formula that tells the number of unique unordered subsets of size x that can be created from n unique elements.
The formula is read “n combinatorial x”. Sometimes it is read as “n choose x." The exclamation point "!" is called a
factorial and tells us to take all the numbers from 1 through the number before the ! and multiply them together thus
4! is 1*2*3*4=24. By definition 0! = 1. The formula is called the Combinatorial Formula. It is also called the Binomial
Coefficient, for reasons that will be clear shortly. While this mathematical concept was understood long before 1653, Blaise
Pascal is given major credit for his proof that he published in that year. Further, he developed a generalized method of
calculating the values for combinatorials known to us as the Pascal Triangle. Pascal was one of the geniuses of an era
of extraordinary intellectual advancement which included the work of Galileo, Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton, William
Shakespeare and the refinement of the scientific method, the very rationale for the topic of this text.

Let’s find the hard way the total number of combinations of the four aces in a deck of cards if we were going to take them
two at a time. The sample space would be:
S={Spade,Heart),(Spade, Diamond),(Spade,Club), (Diamond,Club),(Heart,Diamond),(Heart,Club)}
There are 6 combinations; formally, six unique unordered subsets of size 2 that can be created from 4 unique elements. To
use the combinatorial formula we would solve the formula as follows:
⎛4⎞
4·3·2·1
4!
⎝2⎠ = (4 - 2) !2 ! = 2 · 1 · 2 · 1 = 6

If we wanted to know the number of unique 5 card poker hands that could be created from a 52 card deck we simply
compute:

⎛52⎞
⎝5⎠

where 52 is the total number of unique elements from which we are drawing and 5 is the size group we are putting them
into.
With the combinatorial formula we can count the number of elements in a sample space without having to write each one
of them down, truly a lifetime's work for just the number of 5 card hands from a deck of 52 cards. We can now apply this
tool to a very important probability density function, the hypergeometric distribution.
Remember, a probability density function computes probabilities for us. We simply put the appropriate numbers in the
formula and we get the probability of specific events. However, for these formulas to work they must be applied only to
cases for which they were designed.

4.1 | Hypergeometric Distribution
The simplest probability density function is the hypergeometric. This is the most basic one because it is created by
combining our knowledge of probabilities from Venn diagrams, the addition and multiplication rules, and the combinatorial
counting formula.
To find the number of ways to get 2 aces from the four in the deck we computed:
⎛4⎞
4!
⎝2⎠ = 2 !(4 - 2) ! = 6

And if we did not care what else we had in our hand for the other three cards we would compute:

⎛48⎞
48 !
⎝ 3 ⎠ = 3 !45 ! = 17,296

Putting this together, we can compute the probability of getting exactly two aces in a 5 card poker hand as:
⎛4⎞⎛48⎞
⎝2⎠⎝ 3 ⎠
= .0399
⎛52⎞
⎝5⎠

This solution is really just the probability distribution known as the Hypergeometric. The generalized formula is:

h(x) =

⎛A⎞⎛N - A⎞
⎝ x ⎠⎝ n - x ⎠
⎛N ⎞
⎝n ⎠

where x = the number we are interested in coming from the group with A objects.
h(x) is the probability of x successes, in n attempts, when A successes (aces in this case) are in a population that contains N
elements. The hypergeometric distribution is an example of a discrete probability distribution because there is no possibility
of partial success, that is, there can be no poker hands with 2 1/2 aces. Said another way, a discrete random variable has
to be a whole, or counting, number only. This probability distribution works in cases where the probability of a success
changes with each draw. Another way of saying this is that the events are NOT independent. In using a deck of cards, we
are sampling WITHOUT replacement. If we put each card back after it was drawn then the hypergeometric distribution be
an inappropriate Pdf.
For the hypergeometric to work,

206

Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables

1. the population must be dividable into two and only two independent subsets (aces and non-aces in our example). The
random variable X = the number of items from the group of interest.
2. the experiment must have changing probabilities of success with each experiment (the fact that cards are not replaced
after the draw in our example makes this true in this case). Another way to say this is that you sample without
replacement and therefore each pick is not independent.
3. the random variable must be discrete, rather than continuous.

Example 4.1
A candy dish contains 30 jelly beans and 20 gumdrops. Ten candies are picked at random. What is the probability
that 5 of the 10 are gumdrops? The two groups are jelly beans and gumdrops. Since the probability question asks
for the probability of picking gumdrops, the group of interest (first group A in the formula) is gumdrops. The
size of the group of interest (first group) is 30. The size of the second group is 20. The size of the sample is 10
(jelly beans or gumdrops). Let X = the number of gumdrops in the sample of 10. X takes on the values x = 0, 1,
2, ..., 10. a. What is the probability statement written mathematically? b. What is the hypergeometric probability
density function written out to solve this problem? c. What is the answer to the question "What is the probability
of drawing 5 gumdrops in 10 picks from the dish?"
Solution 4.1
a. P(x = 5)

⎛30⎞⎛20⎞
⎝ 5 ⎠⎝ 5 ⎠
b. P(x = 5) =
⎛ 50 ⎞
⎝10⎠
c. P(x = 5) = 0.215

4.1

A bag contains letter tiles. Forty-four of the tiles are vowels, and 56 are consonants. Seven tiles are picked at
random. You want to know the probability that four of the seven tiles are vowels. What is the group of interest, the size
of the group of interest, and the size of the sample?

4.2 | Binomial Distribution
A more valuable probability density function with many applications is the binomial distribution. This distribution will
compute probabilities for any binomial process. A binomial process, often called a Bernoulli process after the first person
to fully develop its properties, is any case where there are only two possible outcomes in any one trial, called successes and
failures. It gets its name from the binary number system where all numbers are reduced to either 1's or 0's, which is the basis
for computer technology and CD music recordings.

Binomial Formula
n
b(x) = ⎛⎝x⎞⎠ p x q n - x
where b(x) is the probability of X successes in n trials when the probability of a success in ANY ONE TRIAL is p. And of
course q=(1-p) and is the probability of a failure in any one trial.
We can see now why the combinatorial formula is also called the binomial coefficient because it reappears here again in
the binomial probability function. For the binomial formula to work, the probability of a success in any one trial must be
the same from trial to trial, or in other words, the outcomes of each trial must be independent. Flipping a coin is a binomial
process because the probability of getting a head in one flip does not depend upon what has happened in PREVIOUS flips.
(At this time it should be noted that using p for the parameter of the binomial distribution is a violation of the rule that

Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables

207

population parameters are designated with Greek letters. In many textbooks θ (pronounced theta) is used instead of p and
this is how it should be.
Just like a set of data, a probability density function has a mean and a standard deviation that describes the data set. For the
binomial distribution these are given by the formulas:

µ = np
σ = npq
Notice that p is the only parameter in these equations. The binomial distribution is thus seen as coming from the oneparameter family of probability distributions. In short, we know all there is to know about the binomial once we know p,
the probability of a success in any one trial.
In probability theory, under certain circumstances, one probability distribution can be used to approximate another. We say
that one is the limiting distribution of the other. If a small number is to be drawn from a large population, even if there is no
replacement, we can still use the binomial even thought this is not a binomial process. If there is no replacement it violates
the independence rule of the binomial. Nevertheless, we can use the binomial to approximate a probability that is really a
hypergeometric distribution if we are drawing fewer than 10 percent of the population, i.e. n is less than 10 percent of N in
the formula for the hypergeometric function. The rationale for this argument is that when drawing a small percentage of the
population we do not alter the probability of a success from draw to draw in any meaningful way. Imagine drawing from
not one deck of 52 cards but from 6 decks of cards. The probability of say drawing an ace does not change the conditional
probability of what happens on a second draw in the same way it would if there were only 4 aces rather than the 24 aces
now to draw from. This ability to use one probability distribution to estimate others will become very valuable to us later.
There are three characteristics of a binomial experiment.
1. There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter n denotes the number of
trials.
2. The random variable, x , number of successes, is discrete.
3. There are only two possible outcomes, called "success" and "failure," for each trial. The letter p denotes the probability
of a success on any one trial, and q denotes the probability of a failure on any one trial. p + q = 1.
4. The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Think of this as drawing WITH replacement.
Because the n trials are independent, the outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial.
Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, p, of a success and probability, q, of a
failure remain the same. For example, randomly guessing at a true-false statistics question has only two outcomes.
If a success is guessing correctly, then a failure is guessing incorrectly. Suppose Joe always guesses correctly on any
statistics true-false question with a probability p = 0.6. Then, q = 0.4. This means that for every true-false statistics
question Joe answers, his probability of success (p = 0.6) and his probability of failure (q = 0.4) remain the same.
The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable X = the number of
successes obtained in the n independent trials.
The mean, μ, and variance, σ2, for the binomial probability distribution are μ = np and σ2 = npq. The standard deviation, σ,
is then σ = npq .
Any experiment that has characteristics three and four and where n = 1 is called a Bernoulli Trial (named after Jacob
Bernoulli who, in the late 1600s, studied them extensively). A binomial experiment takes place when the number of
successes is counted in one or more Bernoulli Trials.

Example 4.2
Suppose you play a game that you can only either win or lose. The probability that you win any game is 55%,
and the probability that you lose is 45%. Each game you play is independent. If you play the game 20 times, write
the function that describes the probability that you win 15 of the 20 times. Here, if you define X as the number of
wins, then X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 20. The probability of a success is p = 0.55. The probability of a
failure is q = 0.45. The number of trials is n = 20. The probability question can be stated mathematically as P(x =
15).

4.2 A trainer is teaching a dolphin to do tricks. The probability that the dolphin successfully performs the trick is 35%,
and the probability that the dolphin does not successfully perform the trick is 65%. Out of 20 attempts, you want to
find the probability that the dolphin succeeds 12 times. Find the P(X=12) using the binomial Pdf.

Example 4.3
A fair coin is flipped 15 times. Each flip is independent. What is the probability of getting more than ten heads?
Let X = the number of heads in 15 flips of the fair coin. X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 15. Since the coin is
fair, p = 0.5 and q = 0.5. The number of trials is n = 15. State the probability question mathematically.

b. Using the formulas, calculate the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation of X.
c. Find the probability that DeAndre scored with 60 of these shots.
d. Find the probability that DeAndre scored with more than 50 of these shots.

4.3 | Geometric Distribution
The geometric probability density function builds upon what we have learned from the binomial distribution. In this case
the experiment continues until either a success or a failure occurs rather than for a set number of trials. There are three main
characteristics of a geometric experiment.
1. There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success. In other words, you keep
repeating what you are doing until the first success. Then you stop. For example, you throw a dart at a bullseye until
you hit the bullseye. The first time you hit the bullseye is a "success" so you stop throwing the dart. It might take six
tries until you hit the bullseye. You can think of the trials as failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, success, STOP.
2. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever.
3. The probability, p, of a success and the probability, q, of a failure is the same for each trial. p + q = 1 and q = 1 − p.
For example, the probability of rolling a three when you throw one fair die is 1 . This is true no matter how many

6

times you roll the die. Suppose you want to know the probability of getting the first three on the fifth roll. On rolls

one through four, you do not get a face with a three. The probability for each of the rolls is q = 5 , the probability of a
⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞
failure. The probability of getting a three on the fifth roll is ⎝5 ⎠⎝5 ⎠⎝5 ⎠⎝5 ⎠⎝1 ⎠ = 0.0804

4. X = the number of independent trials until the first success.

probability of losing is p = 0.57. What is the probability that it takes five games until you lose? Let X = the number

210

Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables

of games you play until you lose (includes the losing game). Then X takes on the values 1, 2, 3, ... (could go on
indefinitely). The probability question is P(x = 5).

4.5 You throw darts at a board until you hit the center area. Your probability of hitting the center area is p = 0.17. You
want to find the probability that it takes eight throws until you hit the center. What values does X take on?

Example 4.6
A safety engineer feels that 35% of all industrial accidents in her plant are caused by failure of employees to
follow instructions. She decides to look at the accident reports (selected randomly and replaced in the pile after
reading) until she finds one that shows an accident caused by failure of employees to follow instructions. On
average, how many reports would the safety engineer expect to look at until she finds a report showing an
accident caused by employee failure to follow instructions? What is the probability that the safety engineer will
have to examine at least three reports until she finds a report showing an accident caused by employee failure to
follow instructions?
Let X = the number of accidents the safety engineer must examine until she finds a report showing an accident
caused by employee failure to follow instructions. X takes on the values 1, 2, 3, .... The first question asks you
to find the expected value or the mean. The second question asks you to find P(x ≥ 3). ("At least" translates to a
"greater than or equal to" symbol).

4.6

An instructor feels that 15% of students get below a C on their final exam. She decides to look at final exams
(selected randomly and replaced in the pile after reading) until she finds one that shows a grade below a C. We want to
know the probability that the instructor will have to examine at least ten exams until she finds one with a grade below
a C. What is the probability question stated mathematically?

Example 4.7
Suppose that you are looking for a student at your college who lives within five miles of you. You know that 55%
of the 25,000 students do live within five miles of you. You randomly contact students from the college until one
says he or she lives within five miles of you. What is the probability that you need to contact four people?
This is a geometric problem because you may have a number of failures before you have the one success you
desire. Also, the probability of a success stays approximately the same each time you ask a student if he or she
lives within five miles of you. There is no definite number of trials (number of times you ask a student).
a. Let X = the number of ____________ you must ask ____________ one says yes.

a. Let X = the number of students you must ask until one says yes.

Notation for the Geometric: G = Geometric Probability Distribution Function
X ~ G(p)
Read this as "X is a random variable with a geometric distribution." The parameter is p; p = the probability of a success
for each trial.
The Geometric Pdf tells us the probability that the first occurrence of success requires x number of independent trials, each
with success probability p. If the probability of success on each trial is p, then the probability that the xth trial (out of x
trials) is the first success is:

P⎛⎝X = x⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝1 - p⎞⎠ x - 1 p
for x = 1, 2, 3, ....
The expected value of X, the mean of this distribution, is 1/p. This tells us how many trials we have to expect until we get
the first success including in the count the trial that results in success. The above form of the Geometric distribution is used
for modeling the number of trials until the first success. The number of trials includes the one that is a success: x = all trials
including the one that is a success. This can be seen in the form of the formula. If X = number of trials including the success,
then we must multiply the probability of failure, (1-p), times the number of failures, that is X-1.
By contrast, the following form of the geometric distribution is used for modeling number of failures until the first success:

P⎛⎝X = x⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝1 - p⎞⎠ x p
for x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ....
In this case the trial that is a success is not counted as a trial in the formula: x = number of failures. The expected value,
mean, of this distribution is µ =

⎛
⎝

1 − p⎞⎠
p . This tells us how many failures to expect before we have a success. In either case,

the sequence of probabilities is a geometric sequence.

Example 4.8
Assume that the probability of a defective computer component is 0.02. Components are randomly selected. Find
the probability that the first defect is caused by the seventh component tested. How many components do you
expect to test until one is found to be defective?
Let X = the number of computer components tested until the first defect is found.
X takes on the values 1, 2, 3, ... where p = 0.02. X ~ G(0.02)
Find P(x = 7). Answer: P(x = 7) = (1 - 0.02)7-1 × 0.02 = 0.0177.
The probability that the seventh component is the first defect is 0.0177.
The graph of X ~ G(0.02) is:

212

Figure 4.2

The y-axis contains the probability of x, where X = the number of computer components tested. Notice that the
probabilities decline by a common increment. This increment is the same ratio between each number and is called
a geometric progression and thus the name for this probability density function.
The number of components that you would expect to test until you find the first defective component is the mean,
µ = 50 .

4.4 | Poisson Distribution
Another useful probability distribution is the Poisson distribution, or waiting time distribution. This distribution is used to
determine how many checkout clerks are needed to keep the waiting time in line to specified levels, how may telephone
lines are needed to keep the system from overloading, and many other practical applications. A modification of the Poisson,
the Pascal, invented nearly four centuries ago, is used today by telecommunications companies worldwide for load factors,
satellite hookup levels and Internet capacity problems. The distribution gets its name from Simeon Poisson who presented
it in 1837 as an extension of the binomial distribution which we will see can be estimated with the Poisson.
There are two main characteristics of a Poisson experiment.
1. The Poisson probability distribution gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time
or space if these events happen with a known average rate.
2. The events are independently of the time since the last event. For example, a book editor might be interested in the
number of words spelled incorrectly in a particular book. It might be that, on the average, there are five words spelled
incorrectly in 100 pages. The interval is the 100 pages and it is assumed that there is no relationship between when
misspellings occur.
3. The random variable X = the number of occurrences in the interval of interest.

Example 4.12
A bank expects to receive six bad checks per day, on average. What is the probability of the bank getting fewer
than five bad checks on any given day? Of interest is the number of checks the bank receives in one day, so the
time interval of interest is one day. Let X = the number of bad checks the bank receives in one day. If the bank
expects to receive six bad checks per day then the average is six checks per day. Write a mathematical statement
for the probability question.
Solution 4.12
P(x < 5)

Example 4.13
You notice that a news reporter says "uh," on average, two times per broadcast. What is the probability that the
news reporter says "uh" more than two times per broadcast.
This is a Poisson problem because you are interested in knowing the number of times the news reporter says "uh"
during a broadcast.

b. What is the average number of times the news reporter says "uh" during one broadcast?

d. The probability question is P(______).
Solution 4.13
d. P(x > 2)

Notation for the Poisson: P = Poisson Probability Distribution Function
X ~ P(μ)
Read this as "X is a random variable with a Poisson distribution." The parameter is μ (or λ); μ (or λ) = the mean for the
interval of interest. The mean is the number of occurrences that occur on average during the interval period.
The formula for computing probabilities that are from a Poisson process is:

P(x) =

-µ

µx e
x!

where P(X) is the probability of X successes, μ is the expected number of successes based upon historical data, e is the
natural logarithm approximately equal to 2.718, and X is the number of successes per unit, usually per unit of time.
In order to use the Poisson distribution, certain assumptions must hold. These are: the probability of a success, μ, is
unchanged within the interval, there cannot be simultaneous successes within the interval, and finally, that the probability
of a success among intervals is independent, the same assumption of the binomial distribution.
In a way, the Poisson distribution can be thought of as a clever way to convert a continuous random variable, usually
time, into a discrete random variable by breaking up time into discrete independent intervals. This way of thinking about
the Poisson helps us understand why it can be used to estimate the probability for the discrete random variable from the
binomial distribution. The Poisson is asking for the probability of a number of successes during a period of time while the
binomial is asking for the probability of a certain number of successes for a given number of trials.

Example 4.14
Leah's answering machine receives about six telephone calls between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. What is the probability
that Leah receives more than one call in the next 15 minutes?
Let X = the number of calls Leah receives in 15 minutes. (The interval of interest is 15 minutes or 1 hour.)

4

x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
If Leah receives, on the average, six telephone calls in two hours, and there are eight 15 minute intervals in two
hours, then Leah receives
⎛1 ⎞
⎝8 ⎠ (6) = 0.75 calls in 15 minutes, on average. So, μ = 0.75 for this problem.

X ~ P(0.75)
Find P(x > 1). P(x > 1) = 0.1734
Probability that Leah receives more than one telephone call in the next 15 minutes is about 0.1734.
The graph of X ~ P(0.75) is:

We expect the approximation to be good because n is large (greater than 20) and p is small (less than 0.05). The
results are close—both probabilities reported are almost 0.

Estimating the Binomial Distribution with the Poisson Distribution
We found before that the binomial distribution provided an approximation for the hypergeometric distribution. Now we
find that the Poisson distribution can provide an approximation for the binomial. We say that the binomial distribution
approaches the Poisson. The binomial distribution approaches the Poisson distribution is as n gets larger and p is small such
that np becomes a constant value. There are several rules of thumb for when one can say they will use a Poisson to estimate
a binomial. One suggests that np, the mean of the binomial, should be less than 25. Another author suggests that it should
be less than 7. And another, noting that the mean and variance of the Poisson are both the same, suggests that np and npq,
the mean and variance of the binomial, should be greater than 5. There is no one broadly accepted rule of thumb for when
one can use the Poisson to estimate the binomial.
As we move through these probability distributions we are getting to more sophisticated distributions that, in a sense,
contain the less sophisticated distributions within them. This proposition has been proven by mathematicians. This gets us
to the highest level of sophistication in the next probability distribution which can be used as an approximation to all of
those that we have discussed so far. This is the normal distribution.

Example 4.18
A survey of 500 seniors in the Price Business School yields the following information. 75% go straight to work
after graduation. 15% go on to work on their MBA. 9% stay to get a minor in another program. 1% go on to get a
Master's in Finance.
What is the probability that more than 2 seniors go to graduate school for their Master's in finance?

This is clearly a binomial probability distribution problem. The choices are binary when we define the results as
"Graduate School in Finance" versus "all other options." The random variable is discrete, and the events are, we
could assume, independent. Solving as a binomial problem, we have:

KEY TERMS
Bernoulli Trials an experiment with the following characteristics:
1. There are only two possible outcomes called “success” and “failure” for each trial.
2. The probability p of a success is the same for any trial (so the probability q = 1 − p of a failure is the same for
any trial).
Binomial Experiment a statistical experiment that satisfies the following three conditions:
1. There are a fixed number of trials, n.
2. There are only two possible outcomes, called "success" and, "failure," for each trial. The letter p denotes the
probability of a success on one trial, and q denotes the probability of a failure on one trial.
3. The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions.
Binomial Probability Distribution a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from Bernoulli trials; there are a fixed
number, n, of independent trials. “Independent” means that the result of any trial (for example, trial one) does not
affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same conditions. Under these
circumstances the binomial RV X is defined as the number of successes in n trials. The mean is μ = np and the
standard deviation is σ = npq . The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is
P(X = x) = ⎛⎝x ⎞⎠ pxqn − x.

n

Geometric Distribution a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from the Bernoulli trials; the trials are repeated
until the first success. The geometric variable X is defined as the number of trials until the first success. The mean is
μ = 1p and the standard deviation is σ =

1 ⎛ 1 − 1⎞ . The probability of exactly x failures before the first success is
⎠
p⎝ p

given by the formula: P(X = x) = p(1 – p)x – 1 where one wants to know probability for the number of trials until the
first success: the xth trail is the first success.
An alternative formulation of the geometric distribution asks the question: what is the probability of x failures until
the first success? In this formulation the trial that resulted in the first success is not counted. The formula for this
presentation of the geometric is: P(X = x) = p(1 − p) x
The expected value in this form of the geometric distribution is µ =

1− p
p

The easiest way to keep these two forms of the geometric distribution straight is to remember that p is the
probability of success and (1−p) is the probability of failure. In the formula the exponents simply count the number
of successes and number of failures of the desired outcome of the experiment. Of course the sum of these two
numbers must add to the number of trials in the experiment.
Geometric Experiment a statistical experiment with the following properties:
1. There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success.
2. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial.
3. The probability, p, of a success and the probability, q, of a failure do not change from trial to trial.
Hypergeometric Experiment a statistical experiment with the following properties:
1. You take samples from two groups.
2. You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group.
3. You sample without replacement from the combined groups.
4. Each pick is not independent, since sampling is without replacement.
Hypergeometric Probability a discrete random variable (RV) that is characterized by:
1. A fixed number of trials.
2. The probability of success is not the same from trial to trial.
We sample from two groups of items when we are interested in only one group. X is defined as the number of
successes out of the total number of items chosen.

Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables

Poisson Probability Distribution a discrete random variable (RV) that counts the number of times a certain event
will occur in a specific interval; characteristics of the variable:
• The probability that the event occurs in a given interval is the same for all intervals.
• The events occur with a known mean and independently of the time since the last event.
The distribution is defined by the mean μ of the event in the interval. The mean is μ = np. The standard deviation
is σ = µ . The probability of having exactly x successes in r trials is P(x) =

-µ

µx e
x!

. The Poisson distribution is

often used to approximate the binomial distribution, when n is “large” and p is “small” (a general rule is that np
should be greater than or equal to 25 and p should be less than or equal to 0.01).
Probability Distribution Function (PDF) a mathematical description of a discrete random variable (RV), given
either in the form of an equation (formula) or in the form of a table listing all the possible outcomes of an
experiment and the probability associated with each outcome.
Random Variable (RV) a characteristic of interest in a population being studied; common notation for variables are
upper case Latin letters X, Y, Z,...; common notation for a specific value from the domain (set of all possible values
of a variable) are lower case Latin letters x, y, and z. For example, if X is the number of children in a family, then x
represents a specific integer 0, 1, 2, 3,.... Variables in statistics differ from variables in intermediate algebra in the
two following ways.
• The domain of the random variable (RV) is not necessarily a numerical set; the domain may be expressed in
words; for example, if X = hair color then the domain is {black, blond, gray, green, orange}.
• We can tell what specific value x the random variable X takes only after performing the experiment.

CHAPTER REVIEW
4.0 Introduction
The characteristics of a probability distribution or density function (PDF) are as follows:
1. Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive (inclusive means to include zero and one).
2. The sum of the probabilities is one.

The combinatorial formula can provide the number of unique subsets of size x that can be created from n unique objects to
help us calculate probabilities. The combinatorial formula is ⎛⎝x⎞⎠

A hypergeometric experiment is a statistical experiment with the following properties:
1. You take samples from two groups.
2. You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group.
3. You sample without replacement from the combined groups.
4. Each pick is not independent, since sampling is without replacement.
The outcomes of a hypergeometric experiment fit a hypergeometric probability distribution. The random variable X = the
number of items from the group of interest. h(x) =

4.2 Binomial Distribution

1. There are a fixed number of trials, n.
2. There are only two possible outcomes, called "success" and, "failure" for each trial. The letter p denotes the

probability of a success on one trial and q denotes the probability of a failure on one trial.
3. The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions.
The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable X = the number of
successes obtained in the n independent trials. The mean of X can be calculated using the formula μ = np, and the standard
deviation is given by the formula σ = npq .
The formula for the Binomial probability density function is

P(x) =

(n - x)
n!
· px q
x !(n - x) !

4.3 Geometric Distribution
There are three characteristics of a geometric experiment:
1. There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success.
2. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial.
3. The probability, p, of a success and the probability, q, of a failure are the same for each trial.
In a geometric experiment, define the discrete random variable X as the number of independent trials until the first success.
We say that X has a geometric distribution and write X ~ G(p) where p is the probability of success in a single trial.
The mean of the geometric distribution X ~ G(p) is μ = 1 / p where x = number of trials until first success for the formula

P(X = x) = (1 - p) x - 1 p where the number of trials is up and including the first success.

An alternative formulation of the geometric distribution asks the question: what is the probability of x failures until the first
success? In this formulation the trial that resulted in the first success is not counted. The formula for this presentation of the
geometric is:

P(X = x) = p(1 − p) x
The expected value in this form of the geometric distribution is

µ=

1− p
p

The easiest way to keep these two forms of the geometric distribution straight is to remember that p is the probability of
success and (1−p) is the probability of failure. In the formula the exponents simply count the number of successes and
number of failures of the desired outcome of the experiment. Of course the sum of these two numbers must add to the
number of trials in the experiment.

4.4 Poisson Distribution
A Poisson probability distribution of a discrete random variable gives the probability of a number of events occurring in
a fixed interval of time or space, if these events happen at a known average rate and independently of the time since the last
event. The Poisson distribution may be used to approximate the binomial, if the probability of success is "small" (less than
or equal to 0.01) and the number of trials is "large" (greater than or equal to 25). Other rules of thumb are also suggested
by different authors, but all recognize that the Poisson distribution is the limiting distribution of the binomial as n increases
and p approaches zero.
The formula for computing probabilities that are from a Poisson process is:

P(x) =

-µ

µx e
x!

where P(X) is the probability of successes, μ (pronounced mu) is the expected number of successes, e is the natural
logarithm approximately equal to 2.718, and X is the number of successes per unit, usually per unit of time.

Introduction
Continuous random variables have many applications. Baseball batting averages, IQ scores, the length of time a long
distance telephone call lasts, the amount of money a person carries, the length of time a computer chip lasts, rates of return
from an investment, and SAT scores are just a few. The field of reliability depends on a variety of continuous random
variables, as do all areas of risk analysis.

NOTE
The values of discrete and continuous random variables can be ambiguous. For example, if X is equal to the number
of miles (to the nearest mile) you drive to work, then X is a discrete random variable. You count the miles. If X is
the distance you drive to work, then you measure values of X and X is a continuous random variable. For a second
example, if X is equal to the number of books in a backpack, then X is a discrete random variable. If X is the weight of
a book, then X is a continuous random variable because weights are measured. How the random variable is defined is
very important.

Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables

5.1 | Properties of Continuous Probability Density
Functions
The graph of a continuous probability distribution is a curve. Probability is represented by area under the curve. We have
already met this concept when we developed relative frequencies with histograms in Chapter 2. The relative area for a
range of values was the probability of drawing at random an observation in that group. Again with the Poisson distribution
in Chapter 4, the graph in Example 4.14 used boxes to represent the probability of specific values of the random variable.
In this case, we were being a bit casual because the random variables of a Poisson distribution are discrete, whole numbers,
and a box has width. Notice that the horizontal axis, the random variable x, purposefully did not mark the points along the
axis. The probability of a specific value of a continuous random variable will be zero because the area under a point is zero.
Probability is area.
The curve is called the probability density function (abbreviated as pdf). We use the symbol f(x) to represent the curve.
f(x) is the function that corresponds to the graph; we use the density function f(x) to draw the graph of the probability
distribution.
Area under the curve is given by a different function called the cumulative distribution function (abbreviated as cdf).
The cumulative distribution function is used to evaluate probability as area. Mathematically, the cumulative probability
density function is the integral of the pdf, and the probability between two values of a continuous random variable will be
the integral of the pdf between these two values: the area under the curve between these values. Remember that the area
under the pdf for all possible values of the random variable is one, certainty. Probability thus can be seen as the relative
percent of certainty between the two values of interest.
• The outcomes are measured, not counted.
• The entire area under the curve and above the x-axis is equal to one.
• Probability is found for intervals of x values rather than for individual x values.
• P(c < x < d) is the probability that the random variable X is in the interval between the values c and d. P(c < x < d) is
the area under the curve, above the x-axis, to the right of c and the left of d.
• P(x = c) = 0 The probability that x takes on any single individual value is zero. The area below the curve, above the
x-axis, and between x = c and x = c has no width, and therefore no area (area = 0). Since the probability is equal to the
area, the probability is also zero.
• P(c < x < d) is the same as P(c ≤ x ≤ d) because probability is equal to area.
We will find the area that represents probability by using geometry, formulas, technology, or probability tables. In general,
integral calculus is needed to find the area under the curve for many probability density functions. When we use formulas
to find the area in this textbook, the formulas were found by using the techniques of integral calculus.
There are many continuous probability distributions. When using a continuous probability distribution to model probability,
the distribution used is selected to model and fit the particular situation in the best way.
In this chapter and the next, we will study the uniform distribution, the exponential distribution, and the normal distribution.
The following graphs illustrate these distributions.

Figure 5.2 The graph shows a Uniform Distribution with the area between x = 3 and x = 6 shaded to represent the
probability that the value of the random variable X is in the interval between three and six.

Figure 5.3 The graph shows an Exponential Distribution with the area between x = 2 and x = 4 shaded to represent
the probability that the value of the random variable X is in the interval between two and four.

Figure 5.4 The graph shows the Standard Normal Distribution with the area between x = 1 and x = 2 shaded to
represent the probability that the value of the random variable X is in the interval between one and two.

For continuous probability distributions, PROBABILITY = AREA.

Example 5.1
Consider the function f(x) = 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20. x = a real number. The graph of f(x) = 1 is a horizontal line.

20

20

However, since 0 ≤ x ≤ 20, f(x) is restricted to the portion between x = 0 and x = 20, inclusive.

f(x) = 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20.

Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables

The graph of f(x) = 1 is a horizontal line segment when 0 ≤ x ≤ 20.

The area corresponds to a probability. The probability that x is between zero and two is 0.1, which can be written
mathematically as P(0 < x < 2) = P(x < 2) = 0.1.
Suppose we want to find the area between f(x) = 1 and the x-axis where 4 < x < 15.

The area corresponds to the probability P(4 < x < 15) = 0.55.
Suppose we want to find P(x = 15). On an x-y graph, x = 15 is a vertical line. A vertical line has no width (or zero

width). Therefore, P(x = 15) = (base)(height) = (0) ⎝ 1 ⎠ = 0
20

Figure 5.8

P(X ≤ x), which can also be written as P(X < x) for continuous distributions, is called the cumulative distribution
function or CDF. Notice the "less than or equal to" symbol. We can also use the CDF to calculate P(X > x).
The CDF gives "area to the left" and P(X > x) gives "area to the right." We calculate P(X > x) for continuous
distributions as follows: P(X > x) = 1 – P (X < x).

Label the graph with f(x) and x. Scale the x and y axes with the maximum x and y values. f(x) = 1 , 0 ≤ x ≤ 20.

To calculate the probability that x is between two values, look at the following graph. Shade the region between x
= 2.3 and x = 12.7. Then calculate the shaded area of a rectangle.

for 0 ≤ x ≤ 8. Draw the graph of f(x) and find P(2.5 < x < 7.5).

5.2 | The Uniform Distribution
The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution and is concerned with events that are equally likely to
occur. When working out problems that have a uniform distribution, be careful to note if the data is inclusive or exclusive
of endpoints.
The mathematical statement of the uniform distribution is
f(x) =

5.3 | The Exponential Distribution
The exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For example,
the amount of time (beginning now) until an earthquake occurs has an exponential distribution. Other examples include the
length of time, in minutes, of long distance business telephone calls, and the amount of time, in months, a car battery lasts. It
can be shown, too, that the value of the change that you have in your pocket or purse approximately follows an exponential
distribution.
Values for an exponential random variable occur in the following way. There are fewer large values and more small values.
For example, marketing studies have shown that the amount of money customers spend in one trip to the supermarket
follows an exponential distribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend
large amounts of money.
Exponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or the length of time a product lasts.
The random variable for the exponential distribution is continuous and often measures a passage of time, although it can
be used in other applications. Typical questions may be, “what is the probability that some event will occur within the next
x hours or days, or what is the probability that some event will occur between x 1 hours and x 2 hours, or what is the

probability that the event will take more than x 1 hours to perform?” In short, the random variable X equals (a) the time
between events or (b) the passage of time to complete an action, e.g. wait on a customer. The probability density function is
given by:

f (x) = 1µ e
where μ is the historical average waiting time.
and has a mean and standard deviation of 1/μ.

− 1µ x

250

Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables

An alternative form of the exponential distribution formula recognizes what is often called the decay factor. The decay factor
simply measures how rapidly the probability of an event declines as the random variable X increases. When the notation
using the decay parameter m is used, the probability density function is presented as:

f (x)

=

me −mx

where m = 1
µ
In order to calculate probabilities for specific probability density functions, the cumulative density function is used. The
cumulative density function (cdf) is simply the integral of the pdf and is:

Example 5.3
Let X = amount of time (in minutes) a postal clerk spends with a customer. The time is known from historical data
to have an average amount of time equal to four minutes.
It is given that μ = 4 minutes, that is, the average time the clerk spends with a customer is 4 minutes. Remember
that we are still doing probability and thus we have to be told the population parameters such as the mean. To
do any calculations, we need to know the mean of the distribution: the historical time to provide a service, for
example. Knowing the historical mean allows the calculation of the decay parameter, m.

m = 1µ . Therefore, m = 1 = 0.25 .
4
When the notation used the decay parameter, m, the probability density function is presented as

f (x)

=

me −mx , which is simply the original formula with m substituted for 1µ , or f (x) = 1µ e

− 1µ x

.

To calculate probabilities for an exponential probability density function, we need to use the cumulative density
function. As shown below, the curve for the cumulative density function is:
f(x) = 0.25e–0.25x where x is at least zero and m = 0.25.
For example, f(5) = 0.25e(-0.25)(5) = 0.072. In other words, the function has a value of .072 when x = 5.
The graph is as follows:

Figure 5.13

Notice the graph is a declining curve. When x = 0,
f(x) = 0.25e(−0.25)(0) = (0.25)(1) = 0.25 = m. The maximum value on the y-axis is always m, one divided by the

e. Is an exponential distribution reasonable for this situation?
Solution 5.7
a. Since we expect 30 customers to arrive per hour (60 minutes), we expect on average one customer to arrive
every two minutes on average.

customers to arrive.

e. This model assumes that a single customer arrives at a time, which may not be reasonable since people
might shop in groups, leading to several customers arriving at the same time. It also assumes that the flow
of customers does not change throughout the day, which is not valid if some times of the day are busier than
others.

Memorylessness of the Exponential Distribution
Recall that the amount of time between customers for the postal clerk discussed earlier is exponentially distributed with
a mean of two minutes. Suppose that five minutes have elapsed since the last customer arrived. Since an unusually long
amount of time has now elapsed, it would seem to be more likely for a customer to arrive within the next minute. With the
exponential distribution, this is not the case–the additional time spent waiting for the next customer does not depend on how
much time has already elapsed since the last customer. This is referred to as the memoryless property. The exponential and
geometric probability density functions are the only probability functions that have the memoryless property. Specifically,

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11776/1.33

Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables

255

the memoryless property says that
P (X > r + t | X > r) = P (X > t) for all r ≥ 0 and t ≥ 0
For example, if five minutes have elapsed since the last customer arrived, then the probability that more than one minute
will elapse before the next customer arrives is computed by using r = 5 and t = 1 in the foregoing equation.
P(X > 5 + 1 | X > 5) = P(X > 1) = e

( – 0.5)(1)

= 0.6065.

This is the same probability as that of waiting more than one minute for a customer to arrive after the previous arrival.
The exponential distribution is often used to model the longevity of an electrical or mechanical device. In Example 5.5,
the lifetime of a certain computer part has the exponential distribution with a mean of ten years. The memoryless property
says that knowledge of what has occurred in the past has no effect on future probabilities. In this case it means that an old
part is not any more likely to break down at any particular time than a brand new part. In other words, the part stays as good
as new until it suddenly breaks. For example, if the part has already lasted ten years, then the probability that it lasts another
seven years is P(X > 17|X > 10) = P(X > 7) = 0.4966, where the vertical line is read as "given".

Example 5.8
Refer back to the postal clerk again where the time a postal clerk spends with his or her customer has an
exponential distribution with a mean of four minutes. Suppose a customer has spent four minutes with a postal
clerk. What is the probability that he or she will spend at least an additional three minutes with the postal clerk?
The decay parameter of X is m = 1 = 0.25, so X ∼ Exp(0.25).

4

The cumulative distribution function is P(X < x) = 1 – e–0.25x.
We want to find P(X > 7|X > 4). The memoryless property says that P(X > 7|X > 4) = P (X > 3), so we just need
to find the probability that a customer spends more than three minutes with a postal clerk.
This is P(X > 3) = 1 – P (X < 3) = 1 – (1 – e–0.25⋅3) = e–0.75 ≈ 0.4724.

Figure 5.19

Relationship between the Poisson and the Exponential Distribution
There is an interesting relationship between the exponential distribution and the Poisson distribution. Suppose that the time
that elapses between two successive events follows the exponential distribution with a mean of μ units of time. Also assume
that these times are independent, meaning that the time between events is not affected by the times between previous events.
If these assumptions hold, then the number of events per unit time follows a Poisson distribution with mean μ. Recall that if
X has the Poisson distribution with mean μ, then P(X = x) =

time between occurrences.
We see that the exponential is the cousin of the Poisson distribution and they are linked through this formula. There are
important differences that make each distribution relevant for different types of probability problems.
First, the Poisson has a discrete random variable, x, where time; a continuous variable is artificially broken into discrete
pieces. We saw that the number of occurrences of an event in a given time interval, x, follows the Poisson distribution.
For example, the number of times the telephone rings per hour. By contrast, the time between occurrences follows the
exponential distribution. For example. The telephone just rang, how long will it be until it rings again? We are measuring
length of time of the interval, a continuous random variable, exponential, not events during an interval, Poisson.

The Exponential Distribution v. the Poisson Distribution
A visual way to show both the similarities and differences between these two distributions is with a time line.

Figure 5.20

The random variable for the Poisson distribution is discrete and thus counts events during a given time period, t1 to t2 on
Figure 5.20, and calculates the probability of that number occurring. The number of events, four in the graph, is measured
in counting numbers; therefore, the random variable of the Poisson is a discrete random variable.
The exponential probability distribution calculates probabilities of the passage of time, a continuous random variable. In
Figure 5.20 this is shown as the bracket from t1 to the next occurrence of the event marked with a triangle.
Classic Poisson distribution questions are "how many people will arrive at my checkout window in the next hour?".
Classic exponential distribution questions are "how long it will be until the next person arrives," or a variant, "how long will
the person remain here once they have arrived?".
Again, the formula for the exponential distribution is:

f (x) = me -mx or f (x) = 1µ e

- 1µ x

We see immediately the similarity between the exponential formula and the Poisson formula.

P(x) =

−µ

µx e
x!

Both probability density functions are based upon the relationship between time and exponential growth or decay. The “e”
in the formula is a constant with the approximate value of 2.71828 and is the base of the natural logarithmic exponential
growth formula. When people say that something has grown exponentially this is what they are talking about.
An example of the exponential and the Poisson will make clear the differences been the two. It will also show the interesting
applications they have.
Poisson Distribution
Suppose that historically 10 customers arrive at the checkout lines each hour. Remember that this is still probability so we
have to be told these historical values. We see this is a Poisson probability problem.
We can put this information into the Poisson probability density function and get a general formula that will calculate the
probability of any specific number of customers arriving in the next hour.
The formula is for any value of the random variable we chose, and so the x is put into the formula. This is the formula:

x -10
f (x) = 10 e
x!

As an example, the probability of 15 people arriving at the checkout counter in the next hour would be
15 -10
P(x = 15) = 10 e = 0.0611
15 !

Here we have inserted x = 15 and calculated the probability that in the next hour 15 people will arrive is .061.
Exponential Distribution
If we keep the same historical facts that 10 customers arrive each hour, but we now are interested in the service time a
person spends at the counter, then we would use the exponential distribution. The exponential probability function for any
value of x, the random variable, for this particular checkout counter historical data is:
-x

f (x) = 1 e .1 = 10e -10x
.1
To calculate µ, the historical average service time, we simply divide the number of people that arrive per hour, 10 , into the
time period, one hour, and have µ = 0.1. Historically, people spend 0.1 of an hour at the checkout counter, or 6 minutes.
This explains the .1 in the formula.
There is a natural confusion with µ in both the Poisson and exponential formulas. They have different meanings, although
they have the same symbol. The mean of the exponential is one divided by the mean of the Poisson. If you are given the
historical number of arrivals you have the mean of the Poisson. If you are given an historical length of time between events
you have the mean of an exponential.
Continuing with our example at the checkout clerk; if we wanted to know the probability that a person would spend 9
minutes or less checking out, then we use this formula. First, we convert to the same time units which are parts of one
hour. Nine minutes is 0.15 of one hour. Next we note that we are asking for a range of values. This is always the case for a
continuous random variable. We write the probability question as:

p⎛⎝x ≤ 9⎞⎠ = 1 - 10e -10x
We can now put the numbers into the formula and we have our result.

p(x = .15) = 1 - 10e

-10(.15)

= 0.7769

The probability that a customer will spend 9 minutes or less checking out is 0.7769.
We see that we have a high probability of getting out in less than nine minutes and a tiny probability of having 15 customers
arriving in the next hour.

knowledge about it. In symbols we say that P(X > x + t|X > x) = P(X > t).
Poisson distribution If there is a known average of μ events occurring per unit time, and these events are independent

CHAPTER REVIEW
5.1 Properties of Continuous Probability Density Functions
The probability density function (pdf) is used to describe probabilities for continuous random variables. The area under the
density curve between two points corresponds to the probability that the variable falls between those two values. In other
words, the area under the density curve between points a and b is equal to P(a < x < b). The cumulative distribution function
(cdf) gives the probability as an area. If X is a continuous random variable, the probability density function (pdf), f(x), is
used to draw the graph of the probability distribution. The total area under the graph of f(x) is one. The area under the graph
of f(x) and between values a and b gives the probability P(a < x < b).

92 Let X = the number of no-hitters throughout a season. Since the duration of time between no-hitters is exponential, the
number of no-hitters per season is Poisson with mean λ = 3.

0 –3
= e–3 ≈ 0.0498
Therefore, (X = 0) = 3 e

0!

NOTE
You could let T = duration of time between no-hitters. Since the time is exponential and there are 3 no-hitters per

season, then the time between no-hitters is 1 season. For the exponential, µ = 1 .
Therefore, m = 1
µ = 3 and T ∼ Exp(3).

a. The desired probability is P(T > 1) = 1 – P(T < 1) = 1 – (1 – e–3) = e–3 ≈ 0.0498.
b. Let T = duration of time between no-hitters. We find P(T > 2|T > 1), and by the memoryless property this is simply
P(T > 1), which we found to be 0.0498 in part a.
c. Let X = the number of no-hitters is a season. Assume that X is Poisson with mean λ = 3. Then P(X > 3) = 1 – P(X ≤ 3)
= 0.3528.
94
a.

100 = 11.11

b. P(X > 10) = 1 – P(X ≤ 10) = 1 – Poissoncdf(11.11, 10) ≈ 0.5532.
c. The number of people with Type B blood encountered roughly follows the Poisson distribution, so the number
of people X who arrive between successive Type B arrivals is roughly exponential with mean μ = 9 and m = 1

. The cumulative distribution function of X is P(X < x) = 1 − e

. Thus hus, P(X > 20) = 1 - P(X ≤ 20) =

We could also deduce that each person arriving has a 8/9 chance of not having Type B blood. So the probability

Introduction
The normal probability density function, a continuous distribution, is the most important of all the distributions. It is widely
used and even more widely abused. Its graph is bell-shaped. You see the bell curve in almost all disciplines. Some of these
include psychology, business, economics, the sciences, nursing, and, of course, mathematics. Some of your instructors may
use the normal distribution to help determine your grade. Most IQ scores are normally distributed. Often real-estate prices
fit a normal distribution.
The normal distribution is extremely important, but it cannot be applied to everything in the real world. Remember here that
we are still talking about the distribution of population data. This is a discussion of probability and thus it is the population
data that may be normally distributed, and if it is, then this is how we can find probabilities of specific events just as we
did for population data that may be binomially distributed or Poisson distributed. This caution is here because in the next
chapter we will see that the normal distribution describes something very different from raw data and forms the foundation
of inferential statistics.
The normal distribution has two parameters (two numerical descriptive measures): the mean (μ) and the standard deviation
(σ). If X is a quantity to be measured that has a normal distribution with mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ), we designate
this by writing the following formula of the normal probability density function:

The curve is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean, μ. The mean is the same as the median, which is
the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about μ. As the notation indicates, the normal distribution depends
only on the mean and the standard deviation. Note that this is unlike several probability density functions we have already
studied, such as the Poisson, where the mean is equal to µ and the standard deviation simply the square root of the mean, or
the binomial, where p is used to determine both the mean and standard deviation. Since the area under the curve must equal
one, a change in the standard deviation, σ, causes a change in the shape of the normal curve; the curve becomes fatter and
wider or skinnier and taller depending on σ. A change in μ causes the graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are
an infinite number of normal probability distributions. One of special interest is called the standard normal distribution.

6.1 | The Standard Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution of standardized values called z-scores. A z-score is measured
in units of the standard deviation.
The mean for the standard normal distribution is zero, and the standard deviation is one. What this does is dramatically
simplify the mathematical calculation of probabilities. Take a moment and substitute zero and one in the appropriate places
in the above formula and you can see that the equation collapses into one that can be much more easily solved using integral
calculus. The transformation z =

x−µ
σ produces the distribution Z ~ N(0, 1). The value x in the given equation comes from

a known normal distribution with known mean μ and known standard deviation σ. The z-score tells how many standard
deviations a particular x is away from the mean.

Z-Scores
If X is a normally distributed random variable and X ~ N(μ, σ), then the z-score for a particular x is:

z=

x – µ
σ

The z-score tells you how many standard deviations the value x is above (to the right of) or below (to the left of) the
mean, μ. Values of x that are larger than the mean have positive z-scores, and values of x that are smaller than the mean
have negative z-scores. If x equals the mean, then x has a z-score of zero.

Example 6.1
Suppose X ~ N(5, 6). This says that X is a normally distributed random variable with mean μ = 5 and standard
deviation σ = 6. Suppose x = 17. Then:

Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution

281

z=

x – µ 17 – 5
σ = 6 =2

This means that x = 17 is two standard deviations (2σ) above or to the right of the mean μ = 5.
Now suppose x = 1. Then: z =

x–µ
1–5
σ = 6 = –0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

This means that x = 1 is 0.67 standard deviations (–0.67σ) below or to the left of the mean μ = 5.

The Empirical Rule
If X is a random variable and has a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ, then the Empirical Rule
states the following:
• About 68% of the x values lie between –1σ and +1σ of the mean µ (within one standard deviation of the mean).
• About 95% of the x values lie between –2σ and +2σ of the mean µ (within two standard deviations of the mean).
• About 99.7% of the x values lie between –3σ and +3σ of the mean µ (within three standard deviations of the mean).
Notice that almost all the x values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.
• The z-scores for +1σ and –1σ are +1 and –1, respectively.
• The z-scores for +2σ and –2σ are +2 and –2, respectively.
• The z-scores for +3σ and –3σ are +3 and –3 respectively.

Figure 6.3

Example 6.2
Suppose x has a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 6.
• About 68% of the x values lie within one standard deviation of the mean. Therefore, about 68% of the x
values lie between –1σ = (–1)(6) = –6 and 1σ = (1)(6) = 6 of the mean 50. The values 50 – 6 = 44 and 50
+ 6 = 56 are within one standard deviation from the mean 50. The z-scores are –1 and +1 for 44 and 56,
respectively.
• About 95% of the x values lie within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, about 95% of the x
values lie between –2σ = (–2)(6) = –12 and 2σ = (2)(6) = 12. The values 50 – 12 = 38 and 50 + 12 = 62 are
within two standard deviations from the mean 50. The z-scores are –2 and +2 for 38 and 62, respectively.
• About 99.7% of the x values lie within three standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, about 95% of the x
values lie between –3σ = (–3)(6) = –18 and 3σ = (3)(6) = 18 of the mean 50. The values 50 – 18 = 32 and 50
+ 18 = 68 are within three standard deviations from the mean 50. The z-scores are –3 and +3 for 32 and 68,
respectively.

6.2 | Using the Normal Distribution
The shaded area in the following graph indicates the area to the right of x. This area is represented by the probability P(X >
x). Normal tables provide the probability between the mean, zero for the standard normal distribution, and a specific value
such as x 1 . This is the unshaded part of the graph from the mean to x 1 .

Figure 6.4

Because the normal distribution is symmetrical , if x 1 were the same distance to the left of the mean the area, probability,
in the left tail, would be the same as the shaded area in the right tail. Also, bear in mind that because of the symmetry of this
distribution, one-half of the probability is to the right of the mean and one-half is to the left of the mean.

Calculations of Probabilities
To find the probability for probability density functions with a continuous random variable we need to calculate the area
under the function across the values of X we are interested in. For the normal distribution this seems a difficult task given
the complexity of the formula. There is, however, a simply way to get what we want. Here again is the formula for the
normal distribution:

1
f (x) =
σ⋅ 2⋅π

⋅ e

x−µ 2
− 1 ⋅ ⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠
2

Looking at the formula for the normal distribution it is not clear just how we are going to solve for the probability doing it
the same way we did it with the previous probability functions. There we put the data into the formula and did the math.
To solve this puzzle we start knowing that the area under a probability density function is the probability.

Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution

283

Figure 6.5

This shows that the area between X1 and X2 is the probability as stated in the formula: P (X1 ≤ x ≤ X2)
The mathematical tool needed to find the area under a curve is integral calculus. The integral of the normal probability
density function between the two points x1 and x2 is the area under the curve between these two points and is the probability
between these two points.
Doing these integrals is no fun and can be very time consuming. But now, remembering that there are an infinite number of
normal distributions out there, we can consider the one with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. This particular
normal distribution is given the name Standard Normal Distribution. Putting these values into the formula it reduces to
a very simple equation. We can now quite easily calculate all probabilities for any value of x, for this particular normal
distribution, that has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. These have been produced and are available here in
the appendix to the text or everywhere on the web. They are presented in various ways. The table in this text is the most
common presentation and is set up with probabilities for one-half the distribution beginning with zero, the mean, and
moving outward. The shaded area in the graph at the top of the table in Statistical Tables represents the probability from
zero to the specific Z value noted on the horizontal axis, Z.
The only problem is that even with this table, it would be a ridiculous coincidence that our data had a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one. The solution is to convert the distribution we have with its mean and standard deviation to this
new Standard Normal Distribution. The Standard Normal has a random variable called Z.
Using the standard normal table, typically called the normal table, to find the probability of one standard deviation, go to the
Z column, reading down to 1.0 and then read at column 0. That number, 0.3413 is the probability from zero to 1 standard
deviation. At the top of the table is the shaded area in the distribution which is the probability for one standard deviation.
The table has solved our integral calculus problem. But only if our data has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.
However, the essential point here is, the probability for one standard deviation on one normal distribution is the same on
every normal distribution. If the population data set has a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 5 then the probability from
10 to 15, one standard deviation, is the same as from zero to 1, one standard deviation on the standard normal distribution.
To compute probabilities, areas, for any normal distribution, we need only to convert the particular normal distribution to
the standard normal distribution and look up the answer in the tables. As review, here again is the standardizing formula:

x-µ
Z= σ
where Z is the value on the standard normal distribution, X is the value from a normal distribution one wishes to convert to
the standard normal, μ and σ are, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of that population. Note that the equation
uses μ and σ which denotes population parameters. This is still dealing with probability so we always are dealing with the
population, with known parameter values and a known distribution. It is also important to note that because the normal
distribution is symmetrical it does not matter if the z-score is positive or negative when calculating a probability. One
standard deviation to the left (negative Z-score) covers the same area as one standard deviation to the right (positive Zscore). This fact is why the Standard Normal tables do not provide areas for the left side of the distribution. Because of this
symmetry, the Z-score formula is sometimes written as:

284

Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution

x-µ
Z=| σ |
Where the vertical lines in the equation means the absolute value of the number.
What the standardizing formula is really doing is computing the number of standard deviations X is from the mean of its
own distribution. The standardizing formula and the concept of counting standard deviations from the mean is the secret
of all that we will do in this statistics class. The reason this is true is that all of statistics boils down to variation, and the
counting of standard deviations is a measure of variation.
This formula, in many disguises, will reappear over and over throughout this course.

Example 6.3
The final exam scores in a statistics class were normally distributed with a mean of 63 and a standard deviation
of five.
a. Find the probability that a randomly selected student scored more than 65 on the exam.

a. Let X = a score on the final exam. X ~ N(63, 5), where μ = 63 and σ = 5.

Then, find P(x > 65).

Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution

P(x ≥ x1) = P(Z ≥ Z1) = 0.3446
The probability that any student selected at random scores more than 65 is 0.3446. Here is how we found this
answer.
The normal table provides probabilities from zero to the value Z1. For this problem the question can be written
as: P(X ≥ 65) = P(Z ≥ Z1), which is the area in the tail. To find this area the formula would be 0.5 – P(X ≤ 65).
One half of the probability is above the mean value because this is a symmetrical distribution. The graph shows
how to find the area in the tail by subtracting that portion from the mean, zero, to the Z1 value. The final answer
is: P(X ≥ 63) = P(Z ≥ 0.4) = 0.3446
z = 65 – 63 = 0.4

5

Area to the left of Z1 to the mean of zero is 0.1554
P(x > 65) = P(z > 0.4) = 0.5 – 0.1554 = 0.3446
Solution 6.3
b.

x-µ
Z = σ = 85 - 63 = 4.4 which is larger than the maximum value on the Standard Normal Table. Therefore,
5
the probability that one student scores less than 85 is approximately one or 100%.
A score of 85 is 4.4 standard deviations from the mean of 63 which is beyond the range of the standard normal
table. Therefore, the probability that one student scores less than 85 is approximately one (or 100%).

6.3 | Estimating the Binomial with the Normal Distribution
We found earlier that various probability density functions are the limiting distributions of others; thus, we can estimate
one with another under certain circumstances. We will find here that the normal distribution can be used to estimate a
binomial process. The Poisson was used to estimate the binomial previously, and the binomial was used to estimate the
hypergeometric distribution.
In the case of the relationship between the hypergeometric distribution and the binomial, we had to recognize that a
binomial process assumes that the probability of a success remains constant from trial to trial: a head on the last flip cannot
have an effect on the probability of a head on the next flip. In the hypergeometric distribution this is the essence of the
question because the experiment assumes that any "draw" is without replacement. If one draws without replacement, then
all subsequent "draws" are conditional probabilities. We found that if the hypergeometric experiment draws only a small
percentage of the total objects, then we can ignore the impact on the probability from draw to draw.
Imagine that there are 312 cards in a deck comprised of 6 normal decks. If the experiment called for drawing only 10
cards, less than 5% of the total, than we will accept the binomial estimate of the probability, even though this is actually a
hypergeometric distribution because the cards are presumably drawn without replacement.
The Poisson likewise was considered an appropriate estimate of the binomial under certain circumstances. In Chapter 4
we found that if the number of trials of interest is large and the probability of success is small, such that µ = np < 7 , the
Poisson can be used to estimate the binomial with good results. Again, these rules of thumb do not in any way claim that
the actual probability is what the estimate determines, only that the difference is in the third or fourth decimal and is thus de
minimus.
Here, again, we find that the normal distribution makes particularly accurate estimates of a binomial process under certain
circumstances. Figure 6.10 is a frequency distribution of a binomial process for the experiment of flipping three coins
where the random variable is the number of heads. The sample space is listed below the distribution. The experiment
assumed that the probability of a success is 0.5; the probability of a failure, a tail, is thus also 0.5. In observing Figure 6.10
we are struck by the fact that the distribution is symmetrical. The root of this result is that the probabilities of success and
failure are the same, 0.5. If the probability of success were smaller than 0.5, the distribution becomes skewed right. Indeed,
as the probability of success diminishes, the degree of skewness increases. If the probability of success increases from 0.5,
then the skewness increases in the lower tail, resulting in a left-skewed distribution.

Figure 6.10

The reason the skewness of the binomial distribution is important is because if it is to be estimated with a normal
distribution, then we need to recognize that the normal distribution is symmetrical. The closer the underlying binomial
distribution is to being symmetrical, the better the estimate that is produced by the normal distribution. Figure 6.11 shows
a symmetrical normal distribution transposed on a graph of a binomial distribution where p = 0.2 and n = 5. The discrepancy

290

Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution

between the estimated probability using a normal distribution and the probability of the original binomial distribution is
apparent. The criteria for using a normal distribution to estimate a binomial thus addresses this problem by requiring BOTH
np AND n(1 − p) are greater than five. Again, this is a rule of thumb, but is effective and results in acceptable estimates of
the binomial probability.

Figure 6.11

Example 6.7
Imagine that it is known that only 10% of Australian Shepherd puppies are born with what is called "perfect
symmetry" in their three colors, black, white, and copper. Perfect symmetry is defined as equal coverage on all
parts of the dog when looked at in the face and measuring left and right down the centerline. A kennel would
have a good reputation for breeding Australian Shepherds if they had a high percentage of dogs that met this
criterion. During the past 5 years and out of the 100 dogs born to Dundee Kennels, 16 were born with this coloring
characteristic.
What is the probability that, in 100 births, more than 16 would have this characteristic?
Solution 6.7
If we assume that one dog's coloring is independent of other dogs' coloring, a bit of a brave assumption, this
becomes a classic binomial probability problem.
The statement of the probability requested is 1 − [p(X = 0) + p(X = 1) + p(X = 2)+ … + p(X = 16)]. This requires
us to calculate 17 binomial formulas and add them together and then subtract from one to get the right hand part
of the distribution. Alternatively, we can use the normal distribution to get an acceptable answer and in much less
time.
First, we need to check if the binomial distribution is symmetrical enough to use the normal distribution. We
know that the binomial for this problem is skewed because the probability of success, 0.1, is not the same as the
probability of failure, 0.9. Nevertheless, both np = 10 and n⎛⎝1 − p⎞⎠ = 90 are larger than 5, the cutoff for using
the normal distribution to estimate the binomial.
Figure 6.11 below shows the binomial distribution and marks the area we wish to know. The mean of the
binomial, 10, is also marked, and the standard deviation is written on the side of the graph: σ = npq = 3.
The area under the distribution from zero to 16 is the probability requested, and has been shaded in. Below the
binomial distribution is a normal distribution to be used to estimate this probability. That probability has also been
shaded.

Figure 6.12

Standardizing from the binomial to the normal distribution as done in the past shows where we are asking for the
probability from 16 to positive infinity, or 100 in this case. We need to calculate the number of standard deviations
16 is away from the mean: 10.

Z=

x − µ 16 − 10

σ =
3

We are asking for the probability beyond two standard deviations, a very unlikely event. We look up two
standard deviations in the standard normal table and find the area from zero to two standard deviations is 0.4772.
We are interested in the tail, however, so we subtract 0.4772 from 0.5 and thus find the area in the tail. Our
conclusion is the probability of a kennel having 16 dogs with "perfect symmetry" is 0.0228. Dundee Kennels has
an extraordinary record in this regard.
Mathematically, we write this as:

1 − ⎡⎣ p⎛⎝X = 0⎞⎠ + p⎛⎝X = 1⎞⎠ + p⎛⎝X = 2⎞⎠ + … + p⎛⎝X = 16⎞⎠⎤⎦ = p⎛⎝X > 16⎞⎠ = p⎛⎝Z > 2⎞⎠ = 0.0228

Standard Normal Distribution a continuous random variable (RV) X ~ N(0, 1); when X follows the standard normal

z-score the linear transformation of the form z = x - µ or written as z = |x – µ| ; if this transformation is applied to

any normal distribution X ~ N(μ, σ) the result is the standard normal distribution Z ~ N(0,1). If this transformation is
applied to any specific value x of the RV with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the result is called the z-score of x.
The z-score allows us to compare data that are normally distributed but scaled differently. A z-score is the number of
standard deviations a particular x is away from its mean value.

CHAPTER REVIEW
6.1 The Standard Normal Distribution
A z-score is a standardized value. Its distribution is the standard normal, Z ~ N(0, 1). The mean of the z-scores is zero and
the standard deviation is one. If z is the z-score for a value x from the normal distribution N(µ, σ) then z tells you how many
standard deviations x is above (greater than) or below (less than) µ.

6.3 Estimating the Binomial with the Normal Distribution
The normal distribution, which is continuous, is the most important of all the probability distributions. Its graph is bellshaped. This bell-shaped curve is used in almost all disciplines. Since it is a continuous distribution, the total area under
the curve is one. The parameters of the normal are the mean µ and the standard deviation σ. A special normal distribution,
called the standard normal distribution is the distribution of z-scores. Its mean is zero, and its standard deviation is one.

7 | THE CENTRAL LIMIT
THEOREM

Figure 7.1 If you want to figure out the distribution of the change people carry in their pockets, using the Central Limit
Theorem and assuming your sample is large enough, you will find that the distribution is the normal probability density
function. (credit: John Lodder)

Introduction
Why are we so concerned with means? Two reasons are: they give us a middle ground for comparison, and they are easy to
calculate. In this chapter, you will study means and the Central Limit Theorem.
The Central Limit Theorem is one of the most powerful and useful ideas in all of statistics. The Central Limit Theorem
is a theorem which means that it is NOT a theory or just somebody's idea of the way things work. As a theorem it ranks
with the Pythagorean Theorem, or the theorem that tells us that the sum of the angles of a triangle must add to 180. These
are facts of the ways of the world rigorously demonstrated with mathematical precision and logic. As we will see this
powerful theorem will determine just what we can, and cannot say, in inferential statistics. The Central Limit Theorem is
concerned with drawing finite samples of size n from a population with a known mean, μ, and a known standard deviation,
σ. The conclusion is that if we collect samples of size n with a "large enough n," calculate each sample's mean, and create a
histogram (distribution) of those means, then the resulting distribution will tend to have an approximate normal distribution.
The astounding result is that it does not matter what the distribution of the original population is, or whether
you even need to know it. The important fact is that the distribution of sample means tend to follow the normal
distribution.

308

Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem

The size of the sample, n, that is required in order to be "large enough" depends on the original population from which the
samples are drawn (the sample size should be at least 30 or the data should come from a normal distribution). If the original
population is far from normal, then more observations are needed for the sample means. Sampling is done randomly and
with replacement in the theoretical model.

7.1 | The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means
The sampling distribution is a theoretical distribution. It is created by taking many many samples of size n from a
population. Each sample mean is then treated like a single observation of this new distribution, the sampling distribution.
The genius of thinking this way is that it recognizes that when we sample we are creating an observation and that
observation must come from some particular distribution. The Central Limit Theorem answers the question: from what
distribution did a sample mean come? If this is discovered, then we can treat a sample mean just like any other observation
and calculate probabilities about what values it might take on. We have effectively moved from the world of statistics where
we know only what we have from the sample, to the world of probability where we know the distribution from which the
sample mean came and the parameters of that distribution.
The reasons that one samples a population are obvious. The time and expense of checking every invoice to determine its
validity or every shipment to see if it contains all the items may well exceed the cost of errors in billing or shipping. For
some products, sampling would require destroying them, called destructive sampling. One such example is measuring the
ability of a metal to withstand saltwater corrosion for parts on ocean going vessels.
Sampling thus raises an important question; just which sample was drawn. Even if the sample were randomly drawn, there
are theoretically an almost infinite number of samples. With just 100 items, there are more than 75 million unique samples
of size five that can be drawn. If six are in the sample, the number of possible samples increases to just more than one
billion. Of the 75 million possible samples, then, which one did you get? If there is variation in the items to be sampled,
there will be variation in the samples. One could draw an "unlucky" sample and make very wrong conclusions concerning
the population. This recognition that any sample we draw is really only one from a distribution of samples provides us with
what is probably the single most important theorem is statistics: the Central Limit Theorem. Without the Central Limit
Theorem it would be impossible to proceed to inferential statistics from simple probability theory. In its most basic form,
the Central Limit Theorem states that regardless of the underlying probability density function of the population data, the
theoretical distribution of the means of samples from the population will be normally distributed. In essence, this says that
the mean of a sample should be treated like an observation drawn from a normal distribution. The Central Limit Theorem
only holds if the sample size is "large enough" which has been shown to be only 30 observations or more.
Figure 7.2 graphically displays this very important proposition.

Notice that the horizontal axis in the top panel is labeled X. These are the individual observations of the population. This
is the unknown distribution of the population values. The graph is purposefully drawn all squiggly to show that it does not
matter just how odd ball it really is. Remember, we will never know what this distribution looks like, or its mean or standard
deviation for that matter.
–

The horizontal axis in the bottom panel is labeled X 's. This is the theoretical distribution called the sampling distribution of
the means. Each observation on this distribution is a sample mean. All these sample means were calculated from individual
samples with the same sample size. The theoretical sampling distribution contains all of the sample mean values from all
the possible samples that could have been taken from the population. Of course, no one would ever actually take all of
these samples, but if they did this is how they would look. And the Central Limit Theorem says that they will be normally
distributed.
The Central Limit Theorem goes even further and tells us the mean and standard deviation of this theoretical distribution.

mean, X , in just the same way as we did for drawing specific observations, X's, when we knew the population mean and
standard deviation and that the population data were normally distributed.. The standardizing formula has to be amended
to recognize that the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution, sometimes, called the standard error of the
mean, are different from those of the population distribution, but otherwise nothing has changed. The new standardizing
formula is

Notice that µ X– in the first formula has been changed to simply µ in the second version. The reason is that mathematically
it can be shown that the expected value of µ X– is equal to µ. This was stated in Table 7.1 above. Mathematically, the E(x)
symbol read the “expected value of x”. This formula will be used in the next unit to provide estimates of the unknown
population parameter μ.

7.2 | Using the Central Limit Theorem
Examples of the Central Limit Theorem
Law of Large Numbers
The law of large numbers says that if you take samples of larger and larger size from any population, then the mean of the
sampling distribution, µ –x tends to get closer and closer to the true population mean, μ. From the Central Limit Theorem,
we know that as n gets larger and larger, the sample means follow a normal distribution. The larger n gets, the smaller the
standard deviation of the sampling distribution gets. (Remember that the standard deviation for the sampling distribution
–
–
of X is σ .) This means that the sample mean x must be closer to the population mean μ as n increases. We can say

n

that μ is the value that the sample means approach as n gets larger. The Central Limit Theorem illustrates the law of large
numbers.
This concept is so important and plays such a critical role in what follows it deserves to be developed further. Indeed, there
are two critical issues that flow from the Central Limit Theorem and the application of the Law of Large numbers to it.
These are
1. The probability density function of the sampling distribution of means is normally distributed regardless of the
underlying distribution of the population observations and
2. standard deviation of the sampling distribution decreases as the size of the samples that were used to calculate the
means for the sampling distribution increases.
Taking these in order. It would seem counterintuitive that the population may have any distribution and the distribution of
means coming from it would be normally distributed. With the use of computers, experiments can be simulated that show
the process by which the sampling distribution changes as the sample size is increased. These simulations show visually the
results of the mathematical proof of the Central Limit Theorem.
Here are three examples of very different population distributions and the evolution of the sampling distribution to a normal
distribution as the sample size increases. The top panel in these cases represents the histogram for the original data. The
three panels show the histograms for 1,000 randomly drawn samples for different sample sizes: n=10, n= 25 and n=50. As
the sample size increases, and the number of samples taken remains constant, the distribution of the 1,000 sample means
becomes closer to the smooth line that represents the normal distribution.
Figure 7.3 is for a normal distribution of individual observations and we would expect the sampling distribution to
converge on the normal quickly. The results show this and show that even at a very small sample size the distribution is
close to the normal distribution.

Figure 7.5 is a skewed distribution. This last one could be an exponential, geometric, or binomial with a small probability
of success creating the skew in the distribution. For skewed distributions our intuition would say that this will take larger
sample sizes to move to a normal distribution and indeed that is what we observe from the simulation. Nevertheless, at a
sample size of 50, not considered a very large sample, the distribution of sample means has very decidedly gained the shape
of the normal distribution.

Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem

Figure 7.5

The Central Limit Theorem provides more than the proof that the sampling distribution of means is normally distributed. It
also provides us with the mean and standard deviation of this distribution. Further, as discussed above, the expected value
of the mean, µ –x , is equal to the mean of the population of the original data which is what we are interested in estimating
from the sample we took. We have already inserted this conclusion of the Central Limit Theorem into the formula we use
for standardizing from the sampling distribution to the standard normal distribution. And finally, the Central Limit Theorem
has also provided the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, σ –x = σ , and this is critical to have to calculate
–

n

probabilities of values of the new random variable, x .
–

Figure 7.6 shows a sampling distribution. The mean has been marked on the horizontal axis of the x 's and the standard
deviation has been written to the right above the distribution. Notice that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
is the original standard deviation of the population, divided by the sample size. We have already seen that as the sample
size increases the sampling distribution becomes closer and closer to the normal distribution. As this happens, the standard
deviation of the sampling distribution changes in another way; the standard deviation decreases as n increases. At very very
large n, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution becomes very small and at infinity it collapses on top of the
population mean. This is what it means that the expected value of µ –x is the population mean, µ.

Figure 7.6

At non-extreme values of n,this relationship between the standard deviation of the sampling distribution and the sample size
plays a very important part in our ability to estimate the parameters we are interested in.
Figure 7.7 shows three sampling distributions. The only change that was made is the sample size that was used to get the
sample means for each distribution. As the sample size increases, n goes from 10 to 30 to 50, the standard deviations of the
respective sampling distributions decrease because the sample size is in the denominator of the standard deviations of the
sampling distributions.

Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem

317

Figure 7.7

The implications for this are very important. Figure 7.8 shows the effect of the sample size on the confidence we will have
in our estimates. These are two sampling distributions from the same population. One sampling distribution was created
with samples of size 10 and the other with samples of size 50. All other things constant, the sampling distribution with
sample size 50 has a smaller standard deviation that causes the graph to be higher and narrower. The important effect of
this is that for the same probability of one standard deviation from the mean, this distribution covers much less of a range
–
of possible values than the other distribution. One standard deviation is marked on the X axis for each distribution. This
is shown by the two arrows that are plus or minus one standard deviation for each distribution. If the probability that the
true mean is one standard deviation away from the mean, then for the sampling distribution with the smaller sample size,
the possible range of values is much greater. A simple question is, would you rather have a sample mean from the narrow,
tight distribution, or the flat, wide distribution as the estimate of the population mean? Your answer tells us why people
intuitively will always choose data from a large sample rather than a small sample. The sample mean they are getting is
coming from a more compact distribution. This concept will be the foundation for what will be called level of confidence
in the next unit.

Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem

7.3 | The Central Limit Theorem for Proportions
¯

The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the point estimate for the sample mean, x , comes from a normal distribution of
¯

¯

x 's. This theoretical distribution is called the sampling distribution of x 's. We now investigate the sampling distribution
for another important parameter we wish to estimate; p from the binomial probability density function.
If the random variable is discrete, such as for categorical data, then the parameter we wish to estimate is the population
proportion. This is, of course, the probability of drawing a success in any one random draw. Unlike the case just discussed
for a continuous random variable where we did not know the population distribution of X's, here we actually know the
underlying probability density function for these data; it is the binomial. The random variable is X = the number of successes
and the parameter we wish to know is p, the probability of drawing a success which is of course the proportion of successes
in the population. The question at issue is: from what distribution was the sample proportion, p' = nx drawn? The sample
size is n and X is the number of successes found in that sample. This is a parallel question that was just answered by the
¯

Central Limit Theorem: from what distribution was the sample mean, x , drawn? We saw that once we knew that the
distribution was the Normal distribution then we were able to create confidence intervals for the population parameter, µ.
We will also use this same information to test hypotheses about the population mean later. We wish now to be able to
develop confidence intervals for the population parameter "p" from the binomial probability density function.
In order to find the distribution from which sample proportions come we need to develop the sampling distribution of
sample proportions just as we did for sample means. So again imagine that we randomly sample say 50 people and ask them
if they support the new school bond issue. From this we find a sample proportion, p', and graph it on the axis of p's. We
do this again and again etc., etc. until we have the theoretical distribution of p's. Some sample proportions will show high
favorability toward the bond issue and others will show low favorability because random sampling will reflect the variation
of views within the population. What we have done can be seen in Figure 7.9. The top panel is the population distributions
of probabilities for each possible value of the random variable X. While we do not know what the specific distribution looks
like because we do not know p, the population parameter, we do know that it must look something like this. In reality, we
do not know either the mean or the standard deviation of this population distribution, the same difficulty we faced when
analyzing the X's previously.

Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem

319

Figure 7.9

Figure 7.9 places the mean on the distribution of population probabilities as µ = np but of course we do not actually
know the population mean because we do not know the population probability of success, p . Below the distribution of
the population values is the sampling distribution of p 's. Again the Central Limit Theorem tells us that this distribution is
¯

normally distributed just like the case of the sampling distribution for x 's. This sampling distribution also has a mean, the
mean of the p 's, and a standard deviation, σ p ' .
Importantly, in the case of the analysis of the distribution of sample means, the Central Limit Theorem told us the expected
value of the mean of the sample means in the sampling distribution, and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.
Again the Central Limit Theorem provides this information for the sampling distribution for proportions. The answers are:
1. The expected value of the mean of sampling distribution of sample proportions, µ p' , is the population proportion, p.
2. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample proportions, σ p' , is the population standard deviation
divided by the square root of the sample size, n.
Both these conclusions are the same as we found for the sampling distribution for sample means. However in this case,
because the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution both rely upon p , the formula for the standard
deviation of the sampling distribution requires algebraic manipulation to be useful. We will take that up in the next chapter.
The proof of these important conclusions from the Central Limit Theorem is provided below.

E(p ') = E⎛⎝nx ⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝1n ⎞⎠E(x) = ⎛⎝1n ⎞⎠np = p
(The expected value of X, E(x), is simply the mean of the binomial distribution which we know to be np.)

Table 7.2

Table 7.2 summarizes these results and shows the relationship between the population, sample and sampling distribution.
Notice the parallel between this Table and Table 7.1 for the case where the random variable is continuous and we were
developing the sampling distribution for means.
Reviewing the formula for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution for proportions we see that as n increases the
standard deviation decreases. This is the same observation we made for the standard deviation for the sampling distribution
for means. Again, as the sample size increases, the point estimate for either µ or p is found to come from a distribution with
a narrower and narrower distribution. We concluded that with a given level of probability, the range from which the point
estimate comes is smaller as the sample size, n, increases. Figure 7.8 shows this result for the case of sample means. Simply
¯

substitute p ' for x and we can see the impact of the sample size on the estimate of the sample proportion.

7.4 | Finite Population Correction Factor
We saw that the sample size has an important effect on the variance and thus the standard deviation of the sampling
distribution. Also of interest is the proportion of the total population that has been sampled. We have assumed that the
population is extremely large and that we have sampled a small part of the population. As the population becomes smaller
and we sample a larger number of observations the sample observations are not independent of each other. To correct for the
impact of this, the Finite Correction Factor can be used to adjust the variance of the sampling distribution. It is appropriate
when more than 5% of the population is being sampled and the population has a known population size. There are cases
when the population is known, and therefore the correction factor must be applied. The issue arises for both the sampling
distribution of the means and the sampling distribution of proportions. The Finite Population Correction Factor for the
variance of the means shown in the standardizing formula is:

Z=

and for the variance of proportions is:

σ p' =

p⎛⎝1 − p⎞⎠ N − n
n × N−1

The following examples show how to apply the factor. Sampling variances get adjusted using the above formula.

Example 7.1
It is learned that the population of White German Shepherds in the USA is 4,000 dogs, and the mean weight for
German Shepherds is 75.45 pounds. It is also learned that the population standard deviation is 10.37 pounds.
If the sample size is 100 dogs, then find the probability that a sample will have a mean that differs from the true
probability mean by less than 2 pounds.

KEY TERMS
Average a number that describes the central tendency of the data; there are a number of specialized averages, including
the arithmetic mean, weighted mean, median, mode, and geometric mean.
Central Limit Theorem Given a random variable with known mean μ and known standard deviation, σ, we are
–
sampling with size n, and we are interested in two new RVs: the sample mean, X . If the size (n) of the sample is

–
sufficiently large, then X ~ N(μ, σ ). If the size (n) of the sample is sufficiently large, then the distribution of the
n

sample means will approximate a normal distributions regardless of the shape of the population. The mean of the
sample means will equal the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, σ ,

n

is called the standard error of the mean.
Finite Population Correction Factor adjusts the variance of the sampling distribution if the population is known
and more than 5% of the population is being sampled.
Mean a number that measures the central tendency; a common name for mean is "average." The term "mean" is a
shortened form of "arithmetic mean." By definition, the mean for a sample (denoted by –x ) is

–x = Sum of all values in the sample ,
Number of values in the sample
µ=

and

the

mean

for

a

population

(denoted

by

μ)

is

Sum of all values in the population

Number of values in the population

Normal Distribution

, where μ is the mean of the

distribution and σ is the standard deviation.; notation: X ~ N(μ, σ). If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the random variable, Z, is
called the standard normal distribution.
Sampling Distribution Given simple random samples of size n from a given population with a measured
characteristic such as mean, proportion, or standard deviation for each sample, the probability distribution of all the
measured characteristics is called a sampling distribution.
Standard Error of the Mean the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, or σ .

Standard Error of the Proportion the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of proportions

CHAPTER REVIEW
7.1 The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means
In a population whose distribution may be known or unknown, if the size (n) of samples is sufficiently large, the distribution
of the sample means will be approximately normal. The mean of the sample means will equal the population mean. The
standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, called the standard error of the mean, is equal to the population
standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (n).

7.2 Using the Central Limit Theorem
The Central Limit Theorem can be used to illustrate the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers states that the
–
larger the sample size you take from a population, the closer the sample mean x gets to μ.

7.3 The Central Limit Theorem for Proportions
The Central Limit Theorem can also be used to illustrate that the sampling distribution of sample proportions is normally
distributed with the expected value of p and a standard deviation of σ p' =

Introduction
Suppose you were trying to determine the mean rent of a two-bedroom apartment in your town. You might look in the
classified section of the newspaper, write down several rents listed, and average them together. You would have obtained
a point estimate of the true mean. If you are trying to determine the percentage of times you make a basket when shooting
a basketball, you might count the number of shots you make and divide that by the number of shots you attempted. In this
case, you would have obtained a point estimate for the true proportion the parameter p in the binomial probability density
function.
We use sample data to make generalizations about an unknown population. This part of statistics is called inferential
statistics. The sample data help us to make an estimate of a population parameter. We realize that the point estimate is
most likely not the exact value of the population parameter, but close to it. After calculating point estimates, we construct
interval estimates, called confidence intervals. What statistics provides us beyond a simple average, or point estimate, is an
estimate to which we can attach a probability of accuracy, what we will call a confidence level. We make inferences with a
known level of probability.
In this chapter, you will learn to construct and interpret confidence intervals. You will also learn a new distribution,
the Student's-t, and how it is used with these intervals. Throughout the chapter, it is important to keep in mind that the
confidence interval is a random variable. It is the population parameter that is fixed.

Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals

If you worked in the marketing department of an entertainment company, you might be interested in the mean number of
songs a consumer downloads a month from iTunes. If so, you could conduct a survey and calculate the sample mean, –x ,
and the sample standard deviation, s. You would use –x to estimate the population mean and s to estimate the population
standard deviation. The sample mean, –x , is the point estimate for the population mean, μ. The sample standard deviation,
s, is the point estimate for the population standard deviation, σ.

–x and s are each called a statistic.

A confidence interval is another type of estimate but, instead of being just one number, it is an interval of numbers. The
interval of numbers is a range of values calculated from a given set of sample data. The confidence interval is likely to
include the unknown population parameter.
Suppose, for the iTunes example, we do not know the population mean μ, but we do know that the population standard
deviation is σ = 1 and our sample size is 100. Then, by the central limit theorem, the standard deviation of the sampling
distribution of the sample means is

σ = 1 = 0.1 .
n
100
The empirical rule, which applies to the normal distribution, says that in approximately 95% of the samples, the sample
mean, –x , will be within two standard deviations of the population mean μ. For our iTunes example, two standard
deviations is (2)(0.1) = 0.2. The sample mean –x is likely to be within 0.2 units of μ.
Because x- is within 0.2 units of μ, which is unknown, then μ is likely to be within 0.2 units of –x with 95% probability.
The population mean μ is contained in an interval whose lower number is calculated by taking the sample mean and
subtracting two standard deviations (2)(0.1) and whose upper number is calculated by taking the sample mean and adding
two standard deviations. In other words, μ is between –x − 0.2 and –x + 0.2 in 95% of all the samples.
For the iTunes example, suppose that a sample produced a sample mean –x = 2 . Then with 95% probability the unknown
population mean μ is between

–x − 0.2 = 2 − 0.2 = 1.8 and –x + 0.2 = 2 + 0.2 = 2.2

We say that we are 95% confident that the unknown population mean number of songs downloaded from iTunes per month
is between 1.8 and 2.2. The 95% confidence interval is (1.8, 2.2). Please note that we talked in terms of 95% confidence
using the empirical rule. The empirical rule for two standard deviations is only approximately 95% of the probability
under the normal distribution. To be precise, two standard deviations under a normal distribution is actually 95.44% of the
probability. To calculate the exact 95% confidence level we would use 1.96 standard deviations.
The 95% confidence interval implies two possibilities. Either the interval (1.8, 2.2) contains the true mean μ, or our sample
produced an –x that is not within 0.2 units of the true mean μ. The second possibility happens for only 5% of all the
samples (95% minus 100% = 5%).
Remember that a confidence interval is created for an unknown population parameter like the population mean, μ.
For the confidence interval for a mean the formula would be:
–
µ = X ± Zα σ
n

Or written another way as:
–
–
X − Zα σ ≤ µ ≤ X + Zα σ

8.1 | A Confidence Interval for a Population Standard
Deviation, Known or Large Sample Size
A confidence interval for a population mean with a known population standard deviation is based on the conclusion of the
Central Limit Theorem that the sampling distribution of the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution.

Calculating the Confidence Interval
Consider the standardizing formula for the sampling distribution developed in the discussion of the Central Limit Theorem:
−

−

X −µ−
X −µ
Z1 = σ − X = σ
X
n

Notice that µ is substituted for µ −x because we know that the expected value of µ −x is µ from the Central Limit theorem
and σ −x is replaced with σ , also from the Central Limit Theorem.

n

−

In this formula we know X , σ −x and n, the sample size. (In actuality we do not know the population standard deviation,
but we do have a point estimate for it, s, from the sample we took. More on this later.) What we do not know is μ or Z1. We
can solve for either one of these in terms of the other. Solving for μ in terms of Z1 gives:
−
µ = X ± Z1 σ
n
-

Remembering that the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the distribution of the X 's, the sampling distribution for means,
is normal, and that the normal distribution is symmetrical, we can rearrange terms thus:

X − Z α⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠ ≤ µ ≤ X + Z α⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠
n
n
-

-

This is the formula for a confidence interval for the mean of a population.
Notice that Zα has been substituted for Z1 in this equation. This is where a choice must be made by the statistician. The
analyst must decide the level of confidence they wish to impose on the confidence interval. α is the probability that the
interval will not contain the true population mean. The confidence level is defined as (1-α). Zα is the number of standard
deviations X lies from the mean with a certain probability. If we chose Zα = 1.96 we are asking for the 95% confidence
interval because we are setting the probability that the true mean lies within the range at 0.95. If we set Zα at 1.64 we
are asking for the 90% confidence interval because we have set the probability at 0.90. These numbers can be verified by
consulting the Standard Normal table. Divide either 0.95 or 0.90 in half and find that probability inside the body of the
table. Then read on the top and left margins the number of standard deviations it takes to get this level of probability.
In reality, we can set whatever level of confidence we desire simply by changing the Zα value in the formula. It is the
analyst's choice. Common convention in Economics and most social sciences sets confidence intervals at either 90, 95, or 99
percent levels. Levels less than 90% are considered of little value. The level of confidence of a particular interval estimate
is called by (1-α).
A good way to see the development of a confidence interval is to graphically depict the solution to a problem requesting
a confidence interval. This is presented in Figure 8.2 for the example in the introduction concerning the number of
downloads from iTunes. That case was for a 95% confidence interval, but other levels of confidence could have just as
easily been chosen depending on the need of the analyst. However, the level of confidence MUST be pre-set and not subject
to revision as a result of the calculations.

Figure 8.2

For this example, let's say we know that the actual population mean number of iTunes downloads is 2.1. The true population
mean falls within the range of the 95% confidence interval. There is absolutely nothing to guarantee that this will happen.
Further, if the true mean falls outside of the interval we will never know it. We must always remember that we will

336

Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals

never ever know the true mean. Statistics simply allows us, with a given level of probability (confidence), to say that the
true mean is within the range calculated. This is what was called in the introduction, the "level of ignorance admitted".

Changing the Confidence Level or Sample Size
Here again is the formula for a confidence interval for an unknown population mean assuming we know the population
standard deviation:

X − Z α⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠ ≤ µ ≤ X + Z α⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠
n
n
-

-

It is clear that the confidence interval is driven by two things, the chosen level of confidence, Z α , and the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution. The Standard deviation of the sampling distribution is further affected by two things, the
standard deviation of the population and the sample size we chose for our data. Here we wish to examine the effects of each
of the choices we have made on the calculated confidence interval, the confidence level and the sample size.
For a moment we should ask just what we desire in a confidence interval. Our goal was to estimate the population mean
from a sample. We have forsaken the hope that we will ever find the true population mean, and population standard
deviation for that matter, for any case except where we have an extremely small population and the cost of gathering the
data of interest is very small. In all other cases we must rely on samples. With the Central Limit Theorem we have the tools
to provide a meaningful confidence interval with a given level of confidence, meaning a known probability of being wrong.
By meaningful confidence interval we mean one that is useful. Imagine that you are asked for a confidence interval for the
ages of your classmates. You have taken a sample and find a mean of 19.8 years. You wish to be very confident so you
report an interval between 9.8 years and 29.8 years. This interval would certainly contain the true population mean and have
a very high confidence level. However, it hardly qualifies as meaningful. The very best confidence interval is narrow while
having high confidence. There is a natural tension between these two goals. The higher the level of confidence the wider
the confidence interval as the case of the students' ages above. We can see this tension in the equation for the confidence
interval.

µ = x ± Z α⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠
n
_

The confidence interval will increase in width as Zα increases, Zα increases as the level of confidence increases. There
is a tradeoff between the level of confidence and the width of the interval. Now let's look at the formula again and we see
that the sample size also plays an important role in the width of the confidence interval. The sample sized, n , shows up in
the denominator of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. As the sample size increases, the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the width of the confidence interval, while holding constant the level of
confidence. This relationship was demonstrated in Figure 7.80. Again we see the importance of having large samples for
our analysis although we then face a second constraint, the cost of gathering data.

Calculating the Confidence Interval: An Alternative Approach
Another way to approach confidence intervals is through the use of something called the Error Bound. The Error Bound gets
its name from the recognition that it provides the boundary of the interval derived from the standard error of the sampling
distribution. In the equations above it is seen that the interval is simply the estimated mean, sample mean, plus or minus
something. That something is the Error Bound and is driven by the probability we desire to maintain in our estimate, Z α
, times the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The Error Bound for a mean is given the name, Error Bound
Mean, or EBM.
To construct a confidence interval for a single unknown population mean μ, where the population standard deviation is
known, we need x- as an estimate for μ and we need the margin of error. Here, the margin of error (EBM) is called the error
bound for a population mean (abbreviated EBM). The sample mean x- is the point estimate of the unknown population
mean μ.
The confidence interval estimate will have the form:

(point estimate - error bound, point estimate + error bound) or, in symbols,( x- – EBM, x- +EBM )
The mathematical formula for this confidence interval is:

X − Z α⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠ ≤ µ ≤ X + Z α⎛⎝ σ ⎞⎠
n
n
-

-

The margin of error (EBM) depends on the confidence level (abbreviated CL). The confidence level is often considered the
probability that the calculated confidence interval estimate will contain the true population parameter. However, it is more

Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals

337

accurate to state that the confidence level is the percent of confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter
when repeated samples are taken. Most often, it is the choice of the person constructing the confidence interval to choose a
confidence level of 90% or higher because that person wants to be reasonably certain of his or her conclusions.
There is another probability called alpha (α). α is related to the confidence level, CL. α is the probability that the interval
does not contain the unknown population parameter.
Mathematically, 1 - α = CL.
A confidence interval for a population mean with a known standard deviation is based on the fact that the sampling
distribution of the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution. Suppose that our sample has a mean of x- =
10, and we have constructed the 90% confidence interval (5, 15) where EBM = 5.
To get a 90% confidence interval, we must include the central 90% of the probability of the normal distribution. If we
include the central 90%, we leave out a total of α = 10% in both tails, or 5% in each tail, of the normal distribution.
This is a normal distribution curve. The peak of the curve coincides with
the point 10 on the horizontal axis. The points 5 and 15 are labeled on
the axis. Vertical lines are drawn from these points to the curve, and
the region between the lines is shaded. The shaded region has area
equal to 0.90.
Figure 8.3

To capture the central 90%, we must go out 1.645 standard deviations on either side of the calculated sample mean. The
value 1.645 is the z-score from a standard normal probability distribution that puts an area of 0.90 in the center, an area of
0.05 in the far left tail, and an area of 0.05 in the far right tail.
It is important that the standard deviation used must be appropriate for the parameter we are estimating, so in this section
we need to use the standard deviation that applies to the sampling distribution for means which we studied with the Central
Limit Theorem and is, σ .

Calculating the Confidence Interval Using EMB
To construct a confidence interval estimate for an unknown population mean, we need data from a random sample. The
steps to construct and interpret the confidence interval are:
• Calculate the sample mean x- from the sample data. Remember, in this section we know the population standard
deviation σ.
• Find the z-score from the standard normal table that corresponds to the confidence level desired.
• Calculate the error bound EBM.
• Construct the confidence interval.
• Write a sentence that interprets the estimate in the context of the situation in the problem.
We will first examine each step in more detail, and then illustrate the process with some examples.

Finding the z-score for the Stated Confidence Level
When we know the population standard deviation σ, we use a standard normal distribution to calculate the error bound
EBM and construct the confidence interval. We need to find the value of z that puts an area equal to the confidence level (in
decimal form) in the middle of the standard normal distribution Z ~ N(0, 1).
The confidence level, CL, is the area in the middle of the standard normal distribution. CL = 1 – α, so α is the area that is
split equally between the two tails. Each of the tails contains an area equal to α .

2

The z-score that has an area to the right of α is denoted by Z α .

2

2

For example, when CL = 0.95, α = 0.05 and α = 0.025; we write Z α = Z 0.025 .

The area to the right of Z 0.025 is 0.025 and the area to the left of Z 0.025 is 1 – 0.025 = 0.975.

Z α = Z 0.025 = 1.96 , using a standard normal probability table. We will see later that we can use a different probability

We estimate with 90% confidence that the true population mean exam score for all statistics students is between
67.18 and 68.82.

Example 8.2
Suppose we change the original problem in Example 8.1 by using a 95% confidence level. Find a 95%

Notice that the EBM is larger for a 95% confidence level in the original problem.
Comparing the results
The 90% confidence interval is (67.18, 68.82). The 95% confidence interval is (67.02, 68.98). The 95%
confidence interval is wider. If you look at the graphs, because the area 0.95 is larger than the area 0.90, it makes
sense that the 95% confidence interval is wider. To be more confident that the confidence interval actually does
contain the true value of the population mean for all statistics exam scores, the confidence interval necessarily
needs to be wider. This demonstrates a very important principle of confidence intervals. There is a trade off
between the level of confidence and the width of the interval. Our desire is to have a narrow confidence interval,
huge wide intervals provide little information that is useful. But we would also like to have a high level of
confidence in our interval. This demonstrates that we cannot have both.

• Decreasing the confidence level makes the confidence interval narrower.

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution was provided by the Central Limit Theorem as σ . While

n

we infrequently get to choose the sample size it plays an important role in the confidence interval. Because the
sample size is in the denominator of the equation, as n increases it causes the standard deviation of the sampling
distribution to idecrease and thus the width of the confidence interval to decrease. We have met this before as we
reviewed the effects of sample size on the Central Limit Theorem. There we saw that as n increases the sampling
distribution narrows until in the limit it collapses on the true population mean.

original sample size of 36 observations.
Summary: Effect of Changing the Sample Size
• Increasing the sample size makes the confidence interval narrower.
• Decreasing the sample size makes the confidence interval wider.

We have already seen this effect when we reviewed the effects of changing the size of the sample, n, on the Central Limit
Theorem. See Figure 7.7 to see this effect. Before we saw that as the sample size increased the standard deviation of the
sampling distribution decreases. This was why we choose the sample mean from a large sample as compared to a small
sample, all other things held constant.
Thus far we assumed that we knew the population standard deviation. This will virtually never be the case. We will have the
sample standard deviation, s, however. This is a point estimate for the population standard deviation and can be substituted
into the formula for confidence intervals for a mean under certain circumstances. We just saw the effect the sample size
has on the width of confidence interval and the impact on the sampling distribution for our discussion of the Central Limit
Theorem. We can invoke this to substitute the point estimate for the standard deviation if the sample size is large "enough".
Simulation studies indicate that 30 observations or more will be sufficient to eliminate any meaningful bias in the estimated
confidence interval.

Example 8.4
Spring break can be a very expensive holiday. A sample of 80 students is surveyed, and the average amount spent
by students on travel and beverages is $593.84. The sample standard deviation is approximately $369.34.
Construct a 92% confidence interval for the population mean amount of money spent by spring breakers.

Solution 8.4
We begin with the confidence interval for a mean. We use the formula for a mean because the random variable is
dollars spent and this is a continuous random variable. The point estimate for the population standard deviation,
s, has been substituted for the true population standard deviation because with 80 observations there is no concern
for bias in the estimate of the confidence interval.

8.2 | A Confidence Interval for a Population Standard
Deviation Unknown, Small Sample Case
In practice, we rarely know the population standard deviation. In the past, when the sample size was large, this did not
present a problem to statisticians. They used the sample standard deviation s as an estimate for σ and proceeded as before to
calculate a confidence interval with close enough results. This is what we did in Example 8.4 above. The point estimate
for the standard deviation, s, was substituted in the formula for the confidence interval for the population standard deviation.
In this case there 80 observation well above the suggested 30 observations to eliminate any bias from a small sample.
However, statisticians ran into problems when the sample size was small. A small sample size caused inaccuracies in the
confidence interval.
William S. Goset (1876–1937) of the Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland ran into this problem. His experiments with hops
and barley produced very few samples. Just replacing σ with s did not produce accurate results when he tried to calculate
a confidence interval. He realized that he could not use a normal distribution for the calculation; he found that the actual
distribution depends on the sample size. This problem led him to "discover" what is called the Student's t-distribution.
The name comes from the fact that Gosset wrote under the pen name "A Student."
Up until the mid-1970s, some statisticians used the normal distribution approximation for large sample sizes and used the
Student's t-distribution only for sample sizes of at most 30 observations.
If you draw a simple random sample of size n from a population with mean μ and unknown population standard deviation
σ and calculate the t-score t =

x- – µ
⎛s ⎞
⎝ n⎠

, then the t-scores follow a Student's t-distribution with n – 1 degrees of freedom.

The t-score has the same interpretation as the z-score. It measures how far in standard deviation units x- is from its mean
μ. For each sample size n, there is a different Student's t-distribution.
The degrees of freedom, n – 1, come from the calculation of the sample standard deviation s. Remember when we first
calculated a sample standard deviation we divided the sum of the squared deviations by n − 1, but we used n deviations
(x – x- values) to calculate s. Because the sum of the deviations is zero, we can find the last deviation once we know the
other n – 1 deviations. The other n – 1 deviations can change or vary freely. We call the number n – 1 the degrees of
freedom (df) in recognition that one is lost in the calculations. The effect of losing a degree of freedom is that the t-value
increases and the confidence interval increases in width.
Properties of the Student's t-Distribution
• The graph for the Student's t-distribution is similar to the standard normal curve and at infinite degrees of freedom it
is the normal distribution. You can confirm this by reading the bottom line at infinite degrees of freedom for a familiar
level of confidence, e.g. at column 0.05, 95% level of confidence, we find the t-value of 1.96 at infinite degrees of
freedom.
• The mean for the Student's t-distribution is zero and the distribution is symmetric about zero, again like the standard
normal distribution.
• The Student's t-distribution has more probability in its tails than the standard normal distribution because the spread of
the t-distribution is greater than the spread of the standard normal. So the graph of the Student's t-distribution will be
thicker in the tails and shorter in the center than the graph of the standard normal distribution.
• The exact shape of the Student's t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. As the degrees of freedom increases,
the graph of Student's t-distribution becomes more like the graph of the standard normal distribution.
• The underlying population of individual observations is assumed to be normally distributed with unknown population
mean μ and unknown population standard deviation σ. This assumption comes from the Central Limit theorem because
¯

the individual observations in this case are the x s of the sampling distribution. The size of the underlying population
is generally not relevant unless it is very small. If it is normal then the assumption is met and doesn't need discussion.
A probability table for the Student's t-distribution is used to calculate t-values at various commonly-used levels of
confidence. The table gives t-scores that correspond to the confidence level (column) and degrees of freedom (row). When
using a t-table, note that some tables are formatted to show the confidence level in the column headings, while the column
headings in some tables may show only corresponding area in one or both tails. Notice that at the bottom the table will show
the t-value for infinite degrees of freedom. Mathematically, as the degrees of freedom increase, the t distribution approaches
the standard normal distribution. You can find familiar Z-values by looking in the relevant alpha column and reading value

in the last row.
A Student's t table (See Appendix A) gives t-scores given the degrees of freedom and the right-tailed probability.
The Student's t distribution has one of the most desirable properties of the normal: it is symmetrical. What the Student's
t distribution does is spread out the horizontal axis so it takes a larger number of standard deviations to capture the same
amount of probability. In reality there are an infinite number of Student's t distributions, one for each adjustment to the
sample size. As the sample size increases, the Student's t distribution become more and more like the normal distribution.
When the sample size reaches 30 the normal distribution is usually substituted for the Student's t because they are so much
alike. This relationship between the Student's t distribution and the normal distribution is shown in Figure 8.8.

Figure 8.8

This is another example of one distribution limiting another one, in this case the normal distribution is the limiting
distribution of the Student's t when the degrees of freedom in the Student's t approaches infinity. This conclusion comes
directly from the derivation of the Student's t distribution by Mr. Gosset. He recognized the problem as having few
observations and no estimate of the population standard deviation. He was substituting the sample standard deviation and
getting volatile results. He therefore created the Student's t distribution as a ratio of the normal distribution and Chi squared
distribution. The Chi squared distribution is itself a ratio of two variances, in this case the sample variance and the unknown
population variance. The Student's t distribution thus is tied to the normal distribution, but has degrees of freedom that come
from those of the Chi squared distribution. The algebraic solution demonstrates this result.

Here the point estimate of the population standard deviation, s has been substituted for the population standard deviation,
σ, and tν,α has been substituted for Zα. The Greek letter ν (pronounced nu) is placed in the general formula in recognition
that there are many Student tv distributions, one for each sample size. ν is the symbol for the degrees of freedom of the
distribution and depends on the size of the sample. Often df is used to abbreviate degrees of freedom. For this type of
problem, the degrees of freedom is ν = n-1, where n is the sample size. To look up a probability in the Student's t table we
have to know the degrees of freedom in the problem.

Solution 8.5
To help visualize the process of calculating a confident interval we draw the appropriate distribution for the
problem. In this case this is the Student’s t because we do not know the population standard deviation and the
sample is small, less than 30.

Figure 8.9

To find the appropriate t-value requires two pieces of information, the level of confidence desired and the degrees
of freedom. The question asked for a 99% confidence level. On the graph this is shown where (1-α) , the level
of confidence , is in the unshaded area. The tails, thus, have .005 probability each, α/2. The degrees of freedom
for this type of problem is n-1= 9. From the Student’s t table, at the row marked 9 and column marked .005, is
the number of standard deviations to capture 99% of the probability, 3.2498. These are then placed on the graph
remembering that the Student’s t is symmetrical and so the t-value is both plus or minus on each side of the mean.

Inserting these values into the formula gives the result. These values can be placed on the graph to see the
relationship between the distribution of the sample means, X 's and the Student’s t distribution.

8.3 | A Confidence Interval for A Population Proportion
During an election year, we see articles in the newspaper that state confidence intervals in terms of proportions or
percentages. For example, a poll for a particular candidate running for president might show that the candidate has 40%
of the vote within three percentage points (if the sample is large enough). Often, election polls are calculated with 95%
confidence, so, the pollsters would be 95% confident that the true proportion of voters who favored the candidate would be
between 0.37 and 0.43.
Investors in the stock market are interested in the true proportion of stocks that go up and down each week. Businesses that
sell personal computers are interested in the proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers.
Confidence intervals can be calculated for the true proportion of stocks that go up or down each week and for the true
proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers.
The procedure to find the confidence interval for a population proportion is similar to that for the population mean, but the
formulas are a bit different although conceptually identical. While the formulas are different, they are based upon the same
mathematical foundation given to us by the Central Limit Theorem. Because of this we will see the same basic format using
the same three pieces of information: the sample value of the parameter in question, the standard deviation of the relevant
sampling distribution, and the number of standard deviations we need to have the confidence in our estimate that we desire.
How do you know you are dealing with a proportion problem? First, the underlying distribution has a binary random
variable and therefore is a binomial distribution. (There is no mention of a mean or average.) If X is a binomial random
variable, then X ~ B(n, p) where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of a success. To form a sample proportion,
take X, the random variable for the number of successes and divide it by n, the number of trials (or the sample size). The
random variable P′ (read "P prime") is the sample proportion,

P′ = X
n
^

(Sometimes the random variable is denoted as P , read "P hat".)
p′ = the estimated proportion of successes or sample proportion of successes (p′ is a point estimate for p, the true
population proportion, and thus q is the probability of a failure in any one trial.)
x = the number of successes in the sample
n = the size of the sample
The formula for the confidence interval for a population proportion follows the same format as that for an estimate of a
population mean. Remembering the sampling distribution for the proportion from Chapter 7, the standard deviation was
found to be:

The confidence interval for a population proportion, therefore, becomes:

p′⎛⎝1 − p′⎞⎠ ⎤
n
⎦

Z ⎛a ⎞ is set according to our desired degree of confidence and
⎝2 ⎠

p′⎛⎝1 − p′⎞⎠
is the standard deviation of the sampling
n

distribution.
The sample proportions p′ and q′ are estimates of the unknown population proportions p and q. The estimated
proportions p′ and q′ are used because p and q are not known.
Remember that as p moves further from 0.5 the binomial distribution becomes less symmetrical. Because we are estimating
the binomial with the symmetrical normal distribution the further away from symmetrical the binomial becomes the less
confidence we have in the estimate.
This conclusion can be demonstrated through the following analysis. Proportions are based upon the binomial probability
distribution. The possible outcomes are binary, either “success” or “failure”. This gives rise to a proportion, meaning the
percentage of the outcomes that are “successes”. It was shown that the binomial distribution could be fully understood if we
knew only the probability of a success in any one trial, called p. The mean and the standard deviation of the binomial were
found to be:

µ = np
σ = npq
It was also shown that the binomial could be estimated by the normal distribution if BOTH np AND nq were greater than 5.
From the discussion above, it was found that the standardizing formula for the binomial distribution is:

Z=

p' - p

⎛ pq ⎞
⎝ n ⎠

which is nothing more than a restatement of the general standardizing formula with appropriate substitutions for μ and
σ from the binomial. We can use the standard normal distribution, the reason Z is in the equation, because the normal
distribution is the limiting distribution of the binomial. This is another example of the Central Limit Theorem. We have
already seen that the sampling distribution of means is normally distributed. Recall the extended discussion in Chapter 7
concerning the sampling distribution of proportions and the conclusions of the Central Limit Theorem.
We can now manipulate this formula in just the same way we did for finding the confidence intervals for a mean, but to find
the confidence interval for the binomial population parameter, p.

p' - Z α

p'q'
p'q'
n ≤ p ≤ p' + Z α n

Where p′ = x/n, the point estimate of p taken from the sample. Notice that p′ has replaced p in the formula. This is because
we do not know p, indeed, this is just what we are trying to estimate.
Unfortunately, there is no correction factor for cases where the sample size is small so np′ and nq' must always be greater
than 5 to develop an interval estimate for p.

Example 8.6
Suppose that a market research firm is hired to estimate the percent of adults living in a large city who have cell
phones. Five hundred randomly selected adult residents in this city are surveyed to determine whether they have
cell phones. Of the 500 people sampled, 421 responded yes - they own cell phones. Using a 95% confidence level,
compute a confidence interval estimate for the true proportion of adult residents of this city who have cell phones.
Solution 8.6
• The solution step-by-step.

348

Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals

Let X = the number of people in the sample who have cell phones. X is binomial: the random variable is binary,
people either have a cell phone or they do not.
To calculate the confidence interval, we must find p′, q′.
n = 500
x = the number of successes in the sample = 421

p′ = nx = 421 = 0.842
500
p′ = 0.842 is the sample proportion; this is the point estimate of the population proportion.
q′ = 1 – p′ = 1 – 0.842 = 0.158

⎛ ⎞
Since the requested confidence level is CL = 0.95, then α = 1 – CL = 1 – 0.95 = 0.05 ⎝α ⎠ = 0.025.

2

Then z α = z 0.025 = 1.96
2

This can be found using the Standard Normal probability table in Appendix A. This can also be found in the
students t table at the 0.025 column and infinity degrees of freedom because at infinite degrees of freedom the
students t distribution becomes the standard normal distribution, Z.
The confidence interval for the true binomial population proportion is

n ≤ p ≤ p' + Z α n
Substituting in the values from above we find he confidence inte val is : 0.810 ≤ p ≤ 0.874

Interpretation
We estimate with 95% confidence that between 81% and 87.4% of all adult residents of this city have cell phones.
Explanation of 95% Confidence Level
Ninety-five percent of the confidence intervals constructed in this way would contain the true value for the
population proportion of all adult residents of this city who have cell phones.

Suppose 250 randomly selected people are surveyed to determine if they own a tablet. Of the 250 surveyed, 98
reported owning a tablet. Using a 95% confidence level, compute a confidence interval estimate for the true proportion
of people who own tablets.

Example 8.7
The Dundee Dog Training School has a larger than average proportion of clients who compete in competitive
professional events. A confidence interval for the population proportion of dogs that compete in professional
events from 150 different training schools is constructed. The lower limit is determined to be 0.08 and the upper
limit is determined to be 0.16. Determine the level of confidence used to construct the interval of the population
proportion of dogs that compete in professional events.
Solution 8.7
We begin with the formula for a confidence interval for a proportion because the random variable is binary; either

⎦

Next we find the sample proportion:

p′ = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.12
2
The ± that makes up the confidence interval is thus 0.04; 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.16 and 0.12 − 0.04 = 0.08, the boundaries
of the confidence interval. Finally, we solve for Z.

⎡
0.12(1 − 0.12) ⎤
⎣Z ⋅
⎦ = 0.04 , therefore Z = 1.51
150

And then look up the probability for 1.51 standard deviations on the standard normal table.

p⎛⎝Z = 1.51⎞⎠ = 0.4345 , p⎛⎝Z ⎞⎠ ⋅ 2 = 0.8690 or 86.90 % .

Example 8.8
A financial officer for a company wants to estimate the percent of accounts receivable that are more than 30
days overdue. He surveys 500 accounts and finds that 300 are more than 30 days overdue. Compute a 90%
confidence interval for the true percent of accounts receivable that are more than 30 days overdue, and interpret
the confidence interval.
Solution 8.8
• The solution is step-by-step:
x = 300 and n = 500

p′ = nx = 300 = 0.600
500
q′ = 1 - p′ = 1 - 0.600 = 0.400
⎛ ⎞

Since confidence level = 0.90, then α = 1 – confidence level = (1 – 0.90) = 0.10 ⎝α ⎠ = 0.05

2

Z α = Z0.05 = 1.645
2

This Z-value can be found using a standard normal probability table. The student's t-table can also be used by
entering the table at the 0.05 column and reading at the line for infinite degrees of freedom. The t-distribution is
the normal distribution at infinite degrees of freedom. This is a handy trick to remember in finding Z-values for
commonly used levels of confidence. We use this formula for a confidence interval for a proportion:

p' - Z α

p'q'
p'q'
n ≤ p ≤ p' + Z α n

Substituting in the values from above we find the confidence interval for the true binomial population proportion
is 0.564 ≤ p ≤ 0.636
Interpretation
• We estimate with 90% confidence that the true percent of all accounts receivable overdue 30 days is between
56.4% and 63.6%.
• Alternate Wording: We estimate with 90% confidence that between 56.4% and 63.6% of ALL accounts are
overdue 30 days.

8.4 | Calculating the Sample Size n: Continuous and
Binary Random Variables
Continuous Random Variables
Usually we have no control over the sample size of a data set. However, if we are able to set the sample size, as in cases
where we are taking a survey, it is very helpful to know just how large it should be to provide the most information.
Sampling can be very costly in both time and product. Simple telephone surveys will cost approximately $30.00 each, for
example, and some sampling requires the destruction of the product.
If we go back to our standardizing formula for the sampling distribution for means, we can see that it is possible to solve it
–
for n. If we do this we have ⎛⎝ X - µ⎞⎠ in the denominator.

n=

Z α2 σ 2

⎛–
⎝X

- µ⎞⎠

2

=

Z α2 σ 2
e2

Because we have not taken a sample yet we do not know any of the variables in the formula except that we can set Zα to the
level of confidence we desire just as we did when determining confidence intervals. If we set a predetermined acceptable
–
error, or tolerance, for the difference between X and μ, called e in the formula, we are much further in solving for the
sample size n. We still do not know the population standard deviation, σ. In practice, a pre-survey is usually done which
allows for fine tuning the questionnaire and will give a sample standard deviation that can be used. In other cases, previous
information from other surveys may be used for σ in the formula. While crude, this method of determining the sample
size may help in reducing cost significantly. It will be the actual data gathered that determines the inferences about the
population, so caution in the sample size is appropriate calling for high levels of confidence and small sampling errors.
Binary Random Variables
What was done in cases when looking for the mean of a distribution can also be done when sampling to determine the
population parameter p for proportions. Manipulation of the standardizing formula for proportions gives:

n=

Z α2 pq
e2

where e = (p′-p), and is the acceptable sampling error, or tolerance, for this application. This will be measured in percentage
points.
In this case the very object of our search is in the formula, p, and of course q because q =1-p. This result occurs because
the binomial distribution is a one parameter distribution. If we know p then we know the mean and the standard deviation.
Therefore, p shows up in the standard deviation of the sampling distribution which is where we got this formula. If, in an

abundance of caution, we substitute 0.5 for p we will draw the largest required sample size that will provide the level of
confidence specified by Zα and the tolerance we have selected. This is true because of all combinations of two fractions
that add to one, the largest multiple is when each is 0.5. Without any other information concerning the population parameter
p, this is the common practice. This may result in oversampling, but certainly not under sampling, thus, this is a cautious
approach.
There is an interesting trade-off between the level of confidence and the sample size that shows up here when considering
the cost of sampling. Table 8.1 shows the appropriate sample size at different levels of confidence and different level of
the acceptable error, or tolerance.

Table 8.1

This table is designed to show the maximum sample size required at different levels of confidence given an assumed p= 0.5
and q=0.5 as discussed above.
The acceptable error, called tolerance in the table, is measured in plus or minus values from the actual proportion. For
example, an acceptable error of 5% means that if the sample proportion was found to be 26 percent, the conclusion would be
that the actual population proportion is between 21 and 31 percent with a 90 percent level of confidence if a sample of 271
had been taken. Likewise, if the acceptable error was set at 2%, then the population proportion would be between 24 and 28
percent with a 90 percent level of confidence, but would require that the sample size be increased from 271 to 1,691. If we
wished a higher level of confidence, we would require a larger sample size. Moving from a 90 percent level of confidence
to a 95 percent level at a plus or minus 5% tolerance requires changing the sample size from 271 to 384. A very common
sample size often seen reported in political surveys is 384. With the survey results it is frequently stated that the results are
good to a plus or minus 5% level of “accuracy”.

Example 8.9
Suppose a mobile phone company wants to determine the current percentage of customers aged 50+ who use
text messaging on their cell phones. How many customers aged 50+ should the company survey in order to be
90% confident that the estimated (sample) proportion is within three percentage points of the true population
proportion of customers aged 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones.
Solution 8.9
From the problem, we know that the acceptable error, e, is 0.03 (3%=0.03) and z α z0.05 = 1.645 because the
2

confidence level is 90%. The acceptable error, e, is the difference between the actual population proportion p, and
the sample proportion we expect to get from the sample.
However, in order to find n, we need to know the estimated (sample) proportion p′. Remember that q′ = 1 –
p′. But, we do not know p′ yet. Since we multiply p′ and q′ together, we make them both equal to 0.5 because
p′q′ = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25 results in the largest possible product. (Try other products: (0.6)(0.4) = 0.24; (0.3)(0.7)
= 0.21; (0.2)(0.8) = 0.16 and so on). The largest possible product gives us the largest n. This gives us a large
enough sample so that we can be 90% confident that we are within three percentage points of the true population
proportion. To calculate the sample size n, use the formula and make the substitutions.

KEY TERMS
Binomial Distribution a discrete random variable (RV) which arises from Bernoulli trials; there are a fixed number, n,
of independent trials. “Independent” means that the result of any trial (for example, trial 1) does not affect the
results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the
binomial RV X is defined as the number of successes in n trials. The notation is: X~B(n,p). The mean is μ = np and
n
the standard deviation is σ = npq . The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is P⎛⎝X = x⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝x⎞⎠ p x q n − x
.
Confidence Interval (CI) an interval estimate for an unknown population parameter. This depends on:
• the desired confidence level,
• information that is known about the distribution (for example, known standard deviation),
• the sample and its size.
Confidence Level (CL) the percent expression for the probability that the confidence interval contains the true
population parameter; for example, if the CL = 90%, then in 90 out of 100 samples the interval estimate will enclose
the true population parameter.
Degrees of Freedom (df) the number of objects in a sample that are free to vary
Error Bound for a Population Mean (EBM) the margin of error; depends on the confidence level, sample size, and
known or estimated population standard deviation.
Error Bound for a Population Proportion (EBP) the margin of error; depends on the confidence level, the sample
size, and the estimated (from the sample) proportion of successes.
Inferential Statistics also called statistical inference or inductive statistics; this facet of statistics deals with estimating
a population parameter based on a sample statistic. For example, if four out of the 100 calculators sampled are
defective we might infer that four percent of the production is defective.
Normal Distribution

/

, where μ is the mean

of the distribution and σ is the standard deviation, notation: X ~ N(μ,σ). If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the RV is called the
standard normal distribution.
Parameter a numerical characteristic of a population
Point Estimate a single number computed from a sample and used to estimate a population parameter
Standard Deviation a number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how far data values are
from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and σ for population standard deviation
Student's t-Distribution investigated and reported by William S. Gossett in 1908 and published under the pseudonym
Student; the major characteristics of this random variable (RV) are:
• It is continuous and assumes any real values.
• The pdf is symmetrical about its mean of zero.
• It approaches the standard normal distribution as n get larger.
• There is a "family of t–distributions: each representative of the family is completely defined by the number of
degrees of freedom, which depends upon the application for which the t is being used.

CHAPTER REVIEW
8.2 A Confidence Interval for a Population Standard Deviation Unknown, Small Sample Case
In many cases, the researcher does not know the population standard deviation, σ, of the measure being studied. In these

354

Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals

cases, it is common to use the sample standard deviation, s, as an estimate of σ. The normal distribution creates accurate
confidence intervals when σ is known, but it is not as accurate when s is used as an estimate. In this case, the Student’s
t-distribution is much better. Define a t-score using the following formula:

x- - µ

t=

s
n

The t-score follows the Student’s t-distribution with n – 1 degrees of freedom. The confidence interval under this

distribution is calculated with x ± t α s where t α is the t-score with area to the right equal to α , s is the sample

standard deviation, and n is the sample size. Use a table, calculator, or computer to find t α for a given α.

8.3 A Confidence Interval for A Population Proportion
Some statistical measures, like many survey questions, measure qualitative rather than quantitative data. In this case, the
population parameter being estimated is a proportion. It is possible to create a confidence interval for the true population
proportion following procedures similar to those used in creating confidence intervals for population means. The formulas
are slightly different, but they follow the same reasoning.
Let p′ represent the sample proportion, x/n, where x represents the number of successes and n represents the sample size.
Let q′ = 1 – p′. Then the confidence interval for a population proportion is given by the following formula:

p'q'
p'q'
n ≤ p ≤ p' + Z α n

p' - Z α

8.4 Calculating the Sample Size n: Continuous and Binary Random Variables
Sometimes researchers know in advance that they want to estimate a population mean within a specific margin of error for
a given level of confidence. In that case, solve the relevant confidence interval formula for n to discover the size of the
sample that is needed to achieve this goal:

n=

⎛
⎝

Z α2 σ 2
x - µ⎞⎠ 2

If the random variable is binary then the formula for the appropriate sample size to maintain a particular level of confidence
with a specific tolerance level is given by

Introduction
Now we are down to the bread and butter work of the statistician: developing and testing hypotheses. It is important to
put this material in a broader context so that the method by which a hypothesis is formed is understood completely. Using
textbook examples often clouds the real source of statistical hypotheses.
Statistical testing is part of a much larger process known as the scientific method. This method was developed more than
two centuries ago as the accepted way that new knowledge could be created. Until then, and unfortunately even today,
among some, "knowledge" could be created simply by some authority saying something was so, ipso dicta. Superstition and
conspiracy theories were (are?) accepted uncritically.
The scientific method, briefly, states that only by following a careful and specific process can some assertion be included
in the accepted body of knowledge. This process begins with a set of assumptions upon which a theory, sometimes called a
model, is built. This theory, if it has any validity, will lead to predictions; what we call hypotheses.
As an example, in Microeconomics the theory of consumer choice begins with certain assumption concerning human

382

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

behavior. From these assumptions a theory of how consumers make choices using indifference curves and the budget line.
This theory gave rise to a very important prediction, namely, that there was an inverse relationship between price and
quantity demanded. This relationship was known as the demand curve. The negative slope of the demand curve is really
just a prediction, or a hypothesis, that can be tested with statistical tools.
Unless hundreds and hundreds of statistical tests of this hypothesis had not confirmed this relationship, the so-called Law
of Demand would have been discarded years ago. This is the role of statistics, to test the hypotheses of various theories to
determine if they should be admitted into the accepted body of knowledge; how we understand our world. Once admitted,
however, they may be later discarded if new theories come along that make better predictions.
Not long ago two scientists claimed that they could get more energy out of a process than was put in. This caused a
tremendous stir for obvious reasons. They were on the cover of Time and were offered extravagant sums to bring their
research work to private industry and any number of universities. It was not long until their work was subjected to the
rigorous tests of the scientific method and found to be a failure. No other lab could replicate their findings. Consequently
they have sunk into obscurity and their theory discarded. It may surface again when someone can pass the tests of the
hypotheses required by the scientific method, but until then it is just a curiosity. Many pure frauds have been attempted over
time, but most have been found out by applying the process of the scientific method.
This discussion is meant to show just where in this process statistics falls. Statistics and statisticians are not necessarily in
the business of developing theories, but in the business of testing others' theories. Hypotheses come from these theories
based upon an explicit set of assumptions and sound logic. The hypothesis comes first, before any data are gathered. Data
do not create hypotheses; they are used to test them. If we bear this in mind as we study this section the process of forming
and testing hypotheses will make more sense.
One job of a statistician is to make statistical inferences about populations based on samples taken from the population.
Confidence intervals are one way to estimate a population parameter. Another way to make a statistical inference is to
make a decision about the value of a specific parameter. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck gets
35 miles per gallon, on average. A tutoring service claims that its method of tutoring helps 90% of its students get an A or
a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an average of $60,000 per year.
A statistician will make a decision about these claims. This process is called " hypothesis testing." A hypothesis test
involves collecting data from a sample and evaluating the data. Then, the statistician makes a decision as to whether or not
there is sufficient evidence, based upon analyses of the data, to reject the null hypothesis.
In this chapter, you will conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions. You will also learn about the errors
associated with these tests.

9.1 | Null and Alternative Hypotheses
The actual test begins by considering two hypotheses. They are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints.
H0: The null hypothesis: It is a statement of no difference between a sample mean or proportion and a population mean or
proportion. In other words, the difference equals 0. This can often be considered the status quo and as a result if you cannot
accept the null it requires some action.
Ha: The alternative hypothesis: It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to H0 and what we conclude when
we cannot accept H0. The alternative hypothesis is the contender and must win with significant evidence to overthrow the
status quo. This concept is sometimes referred to the tyranny of the status quo because as we will see later, to overthrow the
null hypothesis takes usually 90 or greater confidence that this is the proper decision.
Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough
evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data.
After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision. There are two options for a
decision. They are "cannot accept H0" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or "do not reject H0" or
"decline to reject H0" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis. These conclusions are all based
upon a level of probability, a significance level, that is set my the analyst.
Table 9.1 presents the various hypotheses in the relevant pairs. For example, if the null hypothesis is equal to some value,
the alternative has to be not equal to that value.

NOTE
As a mathematical convention H0 always has a symbol with an equal in it. Ha never has a symbol with an equal in it.
The choice of symbol depends on the wording of the hypothesis test.

Example 9.1
H0: No more than 30% of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the primary election. p ≤ 30
Ha: More than 30% of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the primary election. p > 30

Example 9.2
We want to test whether the mean GPA of students in American colleges is different from 2.0 (out of 4.0). The
null and alternative hypotheses are:
H0: μ = 2.0
Ha: μ ≠ 2.0

Example 9.3
We want to test if college students take less than five years to graduate from college, on the average. The null and
alternative hypotheses are:
H 0: μ ≥ 5
H a: μ < 5

9.2 | Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors
When you perform a hypothesis test, there are four possible outcomes depending on the actual truth (or falseness) of the
null hypothesis H0 and the decision to reject or not. The outcomes are summarized in the following table:

STATISTICAL DECISION

H0 IS ACTUALLY...
True

False

Cannot reject H0

Correct Outcome Type II error

Cannot accept H0

Type I Error

Table 9.2

The four possible outcomes in the table are:
1. The decision is cannot reject H0 when H0 is true (correct decision).

Correct Outcome

384

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

2. The decision is cannot accept H0 when H0 is true (incorrect decision known as a Type I error). This case is described
as "rejecting a good null". As we will see later, it is this type of error that we will guard against by setting the
probability of making such an error. The goal is to NOT take an action that is an error.
3. The decision is cannot reject H0 when, in fact, H0 is false (incorrect decision known as a Type II error). This is
called "accepting a false null". In this situation you have allowed the status quo to remain in force when it should be
overturned. As we will see, the null hypothesis has the advantage in competition with the alternative.
4. The decision is cannot accept H0 when H0 is false (correct decision).
Each of the errors occurs with a particular probability. The Greek letters α and β represent the probabilities.
α = probability of a Type I error = P(Type I error) = probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis
is true: rejecting a good null.
β = probability of a Type II error = P(Type II error) = probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null
hypothesis is false. (1 − β) is called the Power of the Test.
α and β should be as small as possible because they are probabilities of errors.
Statistics allows us to set the probability that we are making a Type I error. The probability of making a Type I error is
α. Recall that the confidence intervals in the last unit were set by choosing a value called Zα (or tα) and the alpha value
determined the confidence level of the estimate because it was the probability of the interval failing to capture the true mean
(or proportion parameter p). This alpha and that one are the same.
The easiest way to see the relationship between the alpha error and the level of confidence is with the following figure.

Figure 9.2

In the center of Figure 9.2 is a normally distributed sampling distribution marked H0. This is a sampling distribution of
–
X and by the Central Limit Theorem it is normally distributed. The distribution in the center is marked H0 and represents
the distribution for the null hypotheses H0: µ = 100. This is the value that is being tested. The formal statements of the null
and alternative hypotheses are listed below the figure.
The distributions on either side of the H0 distribution represent distributions that would be true if H0 is false, under the
alternative hypothesis listed as Ha. We do not know which is true, and will never know. There are, in fact, an infinite
number of distributions from which the data could have been drawn if Ha is true, but only two of them are on Figure 9.2
representing all of the others.
To test a hypothesis we take a sample from the population and determine if it could have come from the hypothesized
distribution with an acceptable level of significance. This level of significance is the alpha error and is marked on Figure
9.2 as the shaded areas in each tail of the H0 distribution. (Each area is actually α/2 because the distribution is symmetrical
and the alternative hypothesis allows for the possibility for the value to be either greater than or less than the hypothesized
value--called a two-tailed test).
–

If the sample mean marked as X 1 is in the tail of the distribution of H0, we conclude that the probability that it could have
come from the H0 distribution is less than alpha. We consequently state, "the null hypothesis cannot be accepted with (α)
–
level of significance". The truth may be that this X 1 did come from the H0 distribution, but from out in the tail. If this is
so then we have falsely rejected a true null hypothesis and have made a Type I error. What statistics has done is provide an

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

385

estimate about what we know, and what we control, and that is the probability of us being wrong, α.
We can also see in Figure 9.2 that the sample mean could be really from an Ha distribution, but within the boundary set by
–
–
the alpha level. Such a case is marked as X 2 . There is a probability that X 2 actually came from Ha but shows up in the
range of H0 between the two tails. This probability is the beta error, the probability of accepting a false null.
Our problem is that we can only set the alpha error because there are an infinite number of alternative distributions from
which the mean could have come that are not equal to H0. As a result, the statistician places the burden of proof on the
alternative hypothesis. That is, we will not reject a null hypothesis unless there is a greater than 90, or 95, or even 99 percent
probability that the null is false: the burden of proof lies with the alternative hypothesis. This is why we called this the
tyranny of the status quo earlier.
By way of example, the American judicial system begins with the concept that a defendant is "presumed innocent". This is
the status quo and is the null hypothesis. The judge will tell the jury that they can not find the defendant guilty unless the
evidence indicates guilt beyond a "reasonable doubt" which is usually defined in criminal cases as 95% certainty of guilt.
If the jury cannot accept the null, innocent, then action will be taken, jail time. The burden of proof always lies with the
alternative hypothesis. (In civil cases, the jury needs only to be more than 50% certain of wrongdoing to find culpability,
called "a preponderance of the evidence").
The example above was for a test of a mean, but the same logic applies to tests of hypotheses for all statistical parameters
one may wish to test.
The following are examples of Type I and Type II errors.

Example 9.4
Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: Frank's rock climbing equipment is safe.
Type I error: Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe.
Type II error: Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.
α = probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe. β =
probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.
Notice that, in this case, the error with the greater consequence is the Type II error. (If Frank thinks his rock
climbing equipment is safe, he will go ahead and use it.)
This is a situation described as "accepting a false null".

Example 9.5
Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: The victim of an automobile accident is alive when he arrives at the
emergency room of a hospital. This is the status quo and requires no action if it is true. If the null hypothesis
cannot be accepted then action is required and the hospital will begin appropriate procedures.
Type I error: The emergency crew thinks that the victim is dead when, in fact, the victim is alive. Type II error:
The emergency crew does not know if the victim is alive when, in fact, the victim is dead.
α = probability that the emergency crew thinks the victim is dead when, in fact, he is really alive = P(Type I
error). β = probability that the emergency crew does not know if the victim is alive when, in fact, the victim is
dead = P(Type II error).
The error with the greater consequence is the Type I error. (If the emergency crew thinks the victim is dead, they
will not treat him.)

9.5 Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: a patient is not sick. Which type of error has the greater consequence, Type I

386

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

or Type II?

Example 9.6
It’s a Boy Genetic Labs claim to be able to increase the likelihood that a pregnancy will result in a boy being
born. Statisticians want to test the claim. Suppose that the null hypothesis, H0, is: It’s a Boy Genetic Labs has no
effect on gender outcome. The status quo is that the claim is false. The burden of proof always falls to the person
making the claim, in this case the Genetics Lab.
Type I error: This results when a true null hypothesis is rejected. In the context of this scenario, we would state
that we believe that It’s a Boy Genetic Labs influences the gender outcome, when in fact it has no effect. The
probability of this error occurring is denoted by the Greek letter alpha, α.
Type II error: This results when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In context, we would state that It’s a
Boy Genetic Labs does not influence the gender outcome of a pregnancy when, in fact, it does. The probability
of this error occurring is denoted by the Greek letter beta, β.
The error of greater consequence would be the Type I error since couples would use the It’s a Boy Genetic Labs
product in hopes of increasing the chances of having a boy.

“Red tide” is a bloom of poison-producing algae–a few different species of a class of plankton called
dinoflagellates. When the weather and water conditions cause these blooms, shellfish such as clams living in the area
develop dangerous levels of a paralysis-inducing toxin. In Massachusetts, the Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF)
monitors levels of the toxin in shellfish by regular sampling of shellfish along the coastline. If the mean level of toxin
in clams exceeds 800 μg (micrograms) of toxin per kg of clam meat in any area, clam harvesting is banned there until
the bloom is over and levels of toxin in clams subside. Describe both a Type I and a Type II error in this context, and
state which error has the greater consequence.

Example 9.7
A certain experimental drug claims a cure rate of at least 75% for males with prostate cancer. Describe both the
Type I and Type II errors in context. Which error is the more serious?
Type I: A cancer patient believes the cure rate for the drug is less than 75% when it actually is at least 75%.
Type II: A cancer patient believes the experimental drug has at least a 75% cure rate when it has a cure rate that
is less than 75%.
In this scenario, the Type II error contains the more severe consequence. If a patient believes the drug works at
least 75% of the time, this most likely will influence the patient’s (and doctor’s) choice about whether to use the
drug as a treatment option.

9.3 | Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing
Earlier, we discussed sampling distributions. Particular distributions are associated with hypothesis testing.We will perform
hypotheses tests of a population mean using a normal distribution or a Student's t-distribution. (Remember, use a Student's
t-distribution when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small, where small is considered to
be less than 30 observations.) We perform tests of a population proportion using a normal distribution when we can assume
that the distribution is normally distributed. We consider this to be true if the sample proportion, p ' , times the sample
size is greater than 5 and 1- p ' times the sample size is also greater then 5. This is the same rule of thumb we used when

developing the formula for the confidence interval for a population proportion.

Hypothesis Test for the Mean
Going back to the standardizing formula we can derive the test statistic for testing hypotheses concerning means.

Zc =

–

x - µ0
σ/ n

The standardizing formula can not be solved as it is because we do not have μ, the population mean. However, if we
substitute in the hypothesized value of the mean, μ0 in the formula as above, we can compute a Z value. This is the test
statistic for a test of hypothesis for a mean and is presented in Figure 9.3. We interpret this Z value as the associated
–
probability that a sample with a sample mean of X could have come from a distribution with a population mean of H0 and
we call this Z value Zc for “calculated”. Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4 show this process.

Figure 9.3

–

In Figure 9.3 two of the three possible outcomes are presented. X 1 and X 3 are in the tails of the hypothesized
–

distribution of H0. Notice that the horizontal axis in the top panel is labeled X 's. This is the same theoretical distribution of
–

X 's, the sampling distribution, that the Central Limit Theorem tells us is normally distributed. This is why we can draw it
with this shape. The horizontal axis of the bottom panel is labeled Z and is the standard normal distribution. Z α and -Z α ,

called the critical values, are marked on the bottom panel as the Z values associated with the probability the analyst has set
as the level of significance in the test, (α). The probabilities in the tails of both panels are, therefore, the same.
–

Notice that for each X there is an associated Zc, called the calculated Z, that comes from solving the equation above. This
calculated Z is nothing more than the number of standard deviations that the hypothesized mean is from the sample mean.

388

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

If the sample mean falls "too many" standard deviations from the hypothesized mean we conclude that the sample mean
could not have come from the distribution with the hypothesized mean, given our pre-set
required
level of significance.
_
_
It could have come from H0, but it is deemed just too unlikely. In Figure 9.3 both X 1 and X 3 are in the tails of the
distribution. They are deemed "too far" from the hypothesized value of the mean given the chosen level of alpha. If in fact
this sample mean it did come from H0, but from in the tail, we have made a Type I error: we have rejected a good null. Our
only real comfort is that we know the probability of making such an error, α, and we can control the size of α.
_

Figure 9.4 shows the third possibility for the location of the sample mean, x . Here the sample mean is within the two
critical values. That is, within the probability of (1-α) and we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

Figure 9.4

This gives us the decision rule for testing a hypothesis for a two-tailed test:

Decision Rule: Two-tail Test

If Z c < Z α : then cannot REJECT H0

This rule will always be the same no matter what hypothesis we are testing or what formulas we are using to make the
test. The only change will be to change the Zc to the appropriate symbol for the test statistic for the parameter being

tested. Stating the decision rule another way: if the sample mean is unlikely to have come from the distribution with the
hypothesized mean we cannot accept the null hypothesis. Here we define "unlikely" as having a probability less than alpha
of occurring.

P-Value Approach
An alternative decision rule can be developed by calculating the probability that a sample mean could be found that would
give a test statistic larger than the test statistic found from the current sample data assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
Here the notion of "likely" and "unlikely" is defined by the probability of drawing a sample with a mean from a population
with the hypothesized mean that is either larger or smaller than that found in the sample data. Simply stated, the p-value
approach compares the desired significance level, α, to the p-value which is the probability of drawing a sample mean
further from the hypothesized value than the actual sample mean. A large p-value calculated from the data indicates that we
should not reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the more unlikely the outcome, and the stronger the evidence
is against the null hypothesis. We would reject the null hypothesis if the evidence is strongly against it. The relationship
between the decision rule of comparing the calculated test statistics, Zc, and the Critical Value, Zα , and using the p-value
can be seen in Figure 9.5.

Figure 9.5

The calculated value of the test statistic is Zc in this example and is marked on the bottom graph of the standard normal
distribution because it is a Z value. In this case the calculated value is in the tail and thus we cannot accept the null
–
hypothesis, the associated X is just too unusually large to believe that it came from the distribution with a mean of µ0 with
a significance level of α.
If we use the p-value decision rule we need one more step. We need to find in the standard normal table the probability
associated with the calculated test statistic, Zc. We then compare that to the α associated with our selected level of
confidence. In Figure 9.5 we see that the p-value is less than α and therefore we cannot accept the null. We know that
the p-value is less than α because the area under the p-value is smaller than α/2. It is important to note that two researchers
drawing randomly from the same population may find two different P-values from their samples. This occurs because the
P-value is calculated as the probability in the tail beyond the sample mean assuming that the null hypothesis is correct.
Because the sample means will in all likelihood be different this will create two different P-values. Nevertheless, the
conclusions as to the null hypothesis should be different with only the level of probability of α.

390

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

Here is a systematic way to make a decision of whether you cannot accept or cannot reject a null hypothesis if using the
p-value and a preset or preconceived α (the " significance level"). A preset α is the probability of a Type I error (rejecting
the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). It may or may not be given to you at the beginning of the problem. In
any case, the value of α is the decision of the analyst. When you make a decision to reject or not reject H0, do as follows:
• If α > p-value, cannot accept H0. The results of the sample data are significant. There is sufficient evidence to conclude
that H0 is an incorrect belief and that the alternative hypothesis, Ha, may be correct.
• If α ≤ p-value, cannot reject H0. The results of the sample data are not significant. There is not sufficient evidence to
conclude that the alternative hypothesis, Ha, may be correct. In this case the status quo stands.
• When you "cannot reject H0", it does not mean that you should believe that H0 is true. It simply means that the sample
data have failed to provide sufficient evidence to cast serious doubt about the truthfulness of H0. Remember that the
null is the status quo and it takes high probability to overthrow the status quo. This bias in favor of the null hypothesis
is what gives rise to the statement "tyranny of the status quo" when discussing hypothesis testing and the scientific
method.
Both decision rules will result in the same decision and it is a matter of preference which one is used.

One and Two-tailed Tests
The discussion of Figure 9.3-Figure 9.5 was based on the null and alternative hypothesis presented in Figure 9.3. This
was called a two-tailed test because the alternative hypothesis allowed that the mean could have come from a population
which was either larger or smaller than the hypothesized mean in the null hypothesis. This could be seen by the statement
of the alternative hypothesis as μ ≠ 100, in this example.
It may be that the analyst has no concern about the value being "too" high or "too" low from the hypothesized value. If this
is the case, it becomes a one-tailed test and all of the alpha probability is placed in just one tail and not split into α/2 as in
the above case of a two-tailed test. Any test of a claim will be a one-tailed test. For example, a car manufacturer claims that
their Model 17B provides gas mileage of greater than 25 miles per gallon. The null and alternative hypothesis would be:
H0: µ ≤ 25
Ha: µ > 25
The claim would be in the alternative hypothesis. The burden of proof in hypothesis testing is carried in the alternative. This
is because failing to reject the null, the status quo, must be accomplished with 90 or 95 percent significance that it cannot
be maintained. Said another way, we want to have only a 5 or 10 percent probability of making a Type I error, rejecting a
good null; overthrowing the status quo.
This is a one-tailed test and all of the alpha probability is placed in just one tail and not split into α/2 as in the above case of
a two-tailed test.
Figure 9.6 shows the two possible cases and the form of the null and alternative hypothesis that give rise to them.

Effects of Sample Size on Test Statistic
In developing the confidence intervals for the mean from a sample, we found that most often we would not have the
population standard deviation, σ. If the sample size were larger than 30, we could simply substitute the point estimate for σ,
the sample standard deviation, s, and use the student's t distribution to correct for this lack of information.
When testing hypotheses we are faced with this same problem and the solution is exactly the same. Namely: If the
population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size is less than 30, substitute s, the point estimate for the
population standard deviation, σ, in the formula for the test statistic and use the student's t distribution. All the formulas and

392

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

figures above are unchanged except for this substitution and changing the Z distribution to the student's t distribution on
the graph. Remember that the student's t distribution can only be computed knowing the proper degrees of freedom for the
problem. In this case, the degrees of freedom is computed as before with confidence intervals: df = (n-1). The calculated
t-value is compared to the t-value associated with the pre-set level of confidence required in the test, tα, df found in the
student's t tables. If we do not know σ, but the sample size is 30 or more, we simply substitute s for σ and use the normal
distribution.
Table 9.4 summarizes these rules.

A Systematic Approach for Testing A Hypothesis
A systematic approach to hypothesis testing follows the following steps and in this order. This template will work for all
hypotheses that you will ever test.
• Set up the null and alternative hypothesis. This is typically the hardest part of the process. Here the question being
asked is reviewed. What parameter is being tested, a mean, a proportion, differences in means, etc. Is this a one-tailed
test or two-tailed test? Remember, if someone is making a claim it will always be a one-tailed test.
• Decide the level of significance required for this particular case and determine the critical value. These can be found
in the appropriate statistical table. The levels of confidence typical for the social sciences are 90, 95 and 99. However,
the level of significance is a policy decision and should be based upon the risk of making a Type I error, rejecting a
good null. Consider the consequences of making a Type I error.
Next, on the basis of the hypotheses and sample size, select the appropriate test statistic and find the relevant critical
value: Zα, tα, etc. Drawing the relevant probability distribution and marking the critical value is always big help. Be
sure to match the graph with the hypothesis, especially if it is a one-tailed test.
• Take a sample(s) and calculate the relevant parameters: sample mean, standard deviation, or proportion. Using the
formula for the test statistic from above in step 2, now calculate the test statistic for this particular case using the
parameters you have just calculated.
• Compare the calculated test statistic and the critical value. Marking these on the graph will give a good visual picture
of the situation. There are now only two situations:
a. The test statistic is in the tail: Cannot Accept the null, the probability that this sample mean (proportion) came
from the hypothesized distribution is too small to believe that it is the real home of these sample data.
b. The test statistic is not in the tail: Cannot Reject the null, the sample data are compatible with the hypothesized
population parameter.
• Reach a conclusion. It is best to articulate the conclusion two different ways. First a formal statistical conclusion such
as “With a 95 % level of significance we cannot accept the null hypotheses that the population mean is equal to XX
(units of measurement)”. The second statement of the conclusion is less formal and states the action, or lack of action,
required. If the formal conclusion was that above, then the informal one might be, “The machine is broken and we
need to shut it down and call for repairs”.
All hypotheses tested will go through this same process. The only changes are the relevant formulas and those are
determined by the hypothesis required to answer the original question.

Tests on Means
Example 9.8
Jeffrey, as an eight-year old, established a mean time of 16.43 seconds for swimming the 25-yard freestyle, with
a standard deviation of 0.8 seconds. His dad, Frank, thought that Jeffrey could swim the 25-yard freestyle faster
using goggles. Frank bought Jeffrey a new pair of expensive goggles and timed Jeffrey for 15 25-yard freestyle
swims. For the 15 swims, Jeffrey's mean time was 16 seconds. Frank thought that the goggles helped Jeffrey
to swim faster than the 16.43 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset α = 0.05.
Solution 9.8
Set up the Hypothesis Test:

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

393

Since the problem is about a mean, this is a test of a single population mean.
Set the null and alternative hypothesis:
In this case there is an implied challenge or claim. This is that the goggles will reduce the swimming time. The
effect of this is to set the hypothesis as a one-tailed test. The claim will always be in the alternative hypothesis
because the burden of proof always lies with the alternative. Remember that the status quo must be defeated with
a high degree of confidence, in this case 95 % confidence. The null and alternative hypotheses are thus:
H0: μ ≥ 16.43

Ha: μ < 16.43

For Jeffrey to swim faster, his time will be less than 16.43 seconds. The "<" tells you this is left-tailed.
Determine the distribution needed:
¯

Random variable: X = the mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle.
Distribution for the test statistic:
The sample size is less than 30 and we do not know the population standard deviation so this is a t-test. and the
-

X - µ0
proper formula is: t c =
σ/ n
-

μ0 = 16.43 comes from H0 and not the data. X = 16. s = 0.8, and n = 15.
Our step 2, setting the level of significance, has already been determined by the problem, .05 for a 95 %
significance level. It is worth thinking about the meaning of this choice. The Type I error is to conclude that
Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds when, in fact, he actually swims the
25-yard freestyle, on average, in 16.43 seconds. (Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.) For
this case the only concern with a Type I error would seem to be that Jeffery’s dad may fail to bet on his son’s
victory because he does not have appropriate confidence in the effect of the goggles.
To find the critical value we need to select the appropriate test statistic. We have concluded that this is a t-test on
the basis of the sample size and that we are interested in a population mean. We can now draw the graph of the
t-distribution and mark the critical value. For this problem the degrees of freedom are n-1, or 14. Looking up 14
degrees of freedom at the 0.05 column of the t-table we find 1.761. This is the critical value and we can put this
on our graph.
Step 3 is the calculation of the test statistic using the formula we have selected. We find that the calculated test
statistic is 2.08, meaning that the sample mean is 2.08 standard deviations away from the hypothesized mean of
16.43.

Step 4 has us compare the test statistic and the critical value and mark these on the graph. We see that the test statistic is in
the tail and thus we move to step 4 and reach a conclusion. The probability that an average time of 16 minutes could come
from a distribution with a population mean of 16.43 minutes is too unlikely for us to accept the null hypothesis. We cannot
accept the null.
Step 5 has us state our conclusions first formally and then less formally. A formal conclusion would be stated as: “With
a 95% level of significance we cannot accept the null hypothesis that the swimming time with goggles comes from a
distribution with a population mean time of 16.43 minutes.” Less formally, “With 95% significance we believe that the
goggles improves swimming speed”
If we wished to use the p-value system of reaching a conclusion we would calculate the statistic and take the additional step
to find the probability of being 2.08 standard deviations from the mean on a t-distribution. This value is .0187. Comparing
this to the α-level of .05 we see that we cannot accept the null. The p-value has been put on the graph as the shaded area
beyond -2.08 and it shows that it is smaller than the hatched area which is the alpha level of 0.05. Both methods reach the
same conclusion that we cannot accept the null hypothesis.

standard deviation of two yards. The team coach tells Marco to adjust his grip to get more distance. The coach records
the distances for 20 throws. For the 20 throws, Marco’s mean distance was 45 yards. The coach thought the different
grip helped Marco throw farther than 40 yards. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset α = 0.05. Assume the throw

distances for footballs are normal.
First, determine what type of test this is, set up the hypothesis test, find the p-value, sketch the graph, and state your
conclusion.

Example 9.9
Jane has just begun her new job as on the sales force of a very competitive company. In a sample of 16 sales
calls it was found that she closed the contract for an average value of 108 dollars with a standard deviation of 12
dollars. Test at 5% significance that the population mean is at least 100 dollars against the alternative that it is
less than 100 dollars. Company policy requires that new members of the sales force must exceed an average of
$100 per contract during the trial employment period. Can we conclude that Jane has met this requirement at the
significance level of 95%?
Solution 9.9
1. H0: µ ≤ 100
Ha: µ > 100
The null and alternative hypothesis are for the parameter µ because the number of dollars of the contracts is
a continuous random variable. Also, this is a one-tailed test because the company has only an interested if
the number of dollars per contact is below a particular number not "too high" a number. This can be thought
of as making a claim that the requirement is being met and thus the claim is in the alternative hypothesis.
2. Test statistic: t c =

x − µ0

= 108 − 100 = 2.67
⎛ 12 ⎞
⎝ 16 ⎠

3. Critical value: t a = 1.753 with n-1 degrees of freedom= 15
The test statistic is a Student's t because the sample size is below 30; therefore, we cannot use the normal
distribution. Comparing the calculated value of the test statistic and the critical value of t (t a) at a 5%
significance level, we see that the calculated value is in the tail of the distribution. Thus, we conclude that 108
dollars per contract is significantly larger than the hypothesized value of 100 and thus we cannot accept the null
hypothesis. There is evidence that supports Jane's performance meets company standards.

It is believed that a stock price for a particular company will grow at a rate of $5 per week with a standard
deviation of $1. An investor believes the stock won’t grow as quickly. The changes in stock price is recorded for
ten weeks and are as follows: $4, $3, $2, $3, $1, $7, $2, $1, $1, $2. Perform a hypothesis test using a 5% level of
significance. State the null and alternative hypotheses, state your conclusion, and identify the Type I errors.

Example 9.10
A manufacturer of salad dressings uses machines to dispense liquid ingredients into bottles that move along
a filling line. The machine that dispenses salad dressings is working properly when 8 ounces are dispensed.
Suppose that the average amount dispensed in a particular sample of 35 bottles is 7.91 ounces with a variance of
0.03 ounces squared, s 2 . Is there evidence that the machine should be stopped and production wait for repairs?
The lost production from a shutdown is potentially so great that management feels that the level of significance
in the analysis should be 99%.
Again we will follow the steps in our analysis of this problem.
Solution 9.10
STEP 1: Set the Null and Alternative Hypothesis. The random variable is the quantity of fluid placed in the
bottles. This is a continuous random variable and the parameter we are interested in is the mean. Our hypothesis
therefore is about the mean. In this case we are concerned that the machine is not filling properly. From what we
are told it does not matter if the machine is over-filling or under-filling, both seem to be an equally bad error. This
tells us that this is a two-tailed test: if the machine is malfunctioning it will be shutdown regardless if it is from
over-filling or under-filling. The null and alternative hypotheses are thus:

H0 : µ = 8
Ha : µ ≠ 8
STEP 2: Decide the level of significance and draw the graph showing the critical value.
This problem has already set the level of significance at 99%. The decision seems an appropriate one and shows
the thought process when setting the significance level. Management wants to be very certain, as certain as
probability will allow, that they are not shutting down a machine that is not in need of repair. To draw the
distribution and the critical value, we need to know which distribution to use. Because this is a continuous random
variable and we are interested in the mean, and the sample size is greater than 30, the appropriate distribution is
the normal distribution and the relevant critical value is 2.575 from the normal table or the t-table at 0.005 column
and infinite degrees of freedom. We draw the graph and mark these points.

STEP 3: Calculate sample parameters and the test statistic. The sample parameters are provided, the sample
mean is 7.91 and the sample variance is .03 and the sample size is 35. We need to note that the sample variance
was provided not the sample standard deviation, which is what we need for the formula. Remembering that the
standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, we therefore know the sample standard deviation, s,
is 0.173. With this information we calculate the test statistic as -3.07, and mark it on the graph.

STEP 4: Compare test statistic and the critical values Now we compare the test statistic and the critical value by
placing the test statistic on the graph. We see that the test statistic is in the tail, decidedly greater than the critical
value of 2.575. We note that even the very small difference between the hypothesized value and the sample value
is still a large number of standard deviations. The sample mean is only 0.08 ounces different from the required
level of 8 ounces, but it is 3 plus standard deviations away and thus we cannot accept the null hypothesis.
STEP 5: Reach a Conclusion
Three standard deviations of a test statistic will guarantee that the test will fail. The probability that anything is
within three standard deviations is almost zero. Actually it is 0.0026 on the normal distribution, which is certainly
almost zero in a practical sense. Our formal conclusion would be “ At a 99% level of significance we cannot
accept the hypothesis that the sample mean came from a distribution with a mean of 8 ounces” Or less formally,
and getting to the point, “At a 99% level of significance we conclude that the machine is under filling the bottles
and is in need of repair”.

Hypothesis Test for Proportions
Just as there were confidence intervals for proportions, or more formally, the population parameter p of the binomial
distribution, there is the ability to test hypotheses concerning p.
The population parameter for the binomial is p. The estimated value (point estimate) for p is p′ where p′ = x/n, x is the
number of successes in the sample and n is the sample size.
When you perform a hypothesis test of a population proportion p, you take a simple random sample from the population.
The conditions for a binomial distribution must be met, which are: there are a certain number n of independent trials
meaning random sampling, the outcomes of any trial are binary, success or failure, and each trial has the same probability
of a success p. The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be similar to the shape of the normal distribution. To ensure
this, the quantities np′ and nq′ must both be greater than five (np′ > 5 and nq′ > 5). In this case the binomial distribution of
a sample (estimated) proportion can be approximated by the normal distribution with µ = np and σ = npq . Remember
that q = 1 – p . There is no distribution that can correct for this small sample bias and thus if these conditions are not

398

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

met we simply cannot test the hypothesis with the data available at that time. We met this condition when we first were
estimating confidence intervals for p.
Again, we begin with the standardizing formula modified because this is the distribution of a binomial.

Z=

p' - p
pq
n

Substituting p 0 , the hypothesized value of p, we have:

Zc =

p' - p 0
p0 q0
n

This is the test statistic for testing hypothesized values of p, where the null and alternative hypotheses take one of the
following forms:

Two-Tailed Test

One-Tailed Test

One-Tailed Test

H 0: p = p 0

H 0: p ≤ p 0

H 0: p ≥ p 0

Ha : p ≠ p 0

H a: p > p 0

Ha : p < p 0

Table 9.5

The decision rule stated above applies here also: if the calculated value of Zc shows that the sample proportion is "too many"
standard deviations from the hypothesized proportion, the null hypothesis cannot be accepted. The decision as to what is
"too many" is pre-determined by the analyst depending on the level of significance required in the test.

Example 9.11
The mortgage department of a large bank is interested in the nature of loans of first-time borrowers. This
information will be used to tailor their marketing strategy. They believe that 50% of first-time borrowers take out
smaller loans than other borrowers. They perform a hypothesis test to determine if the percentage is the same or
different from 50%. They sample 100 first-time borrowers and find 53 of these loans are smaller that the other
borrowers. For the hypothesis test, they choose a 5% level of significance.
Solution 9.11
STEP 1: Set the null and alternative hypothesis.
H0: p = 0.50

Ha: p ≠ 0.50

The words "is the same or different from" tell you this is a two-tailed test. The Type I and Type II errors are as
follows: The Type I error is to conclude that the proportion of borrowers is different from 50% when, in fact, the
proportion is actually 50%. (Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). The Type II error is there
is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of first time borrowers differs from 50% when, in fact, the
proportion does differ from 50%. (You fail to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.)
STEP 2: Decide the level of significance and draw the graph showing the critical value
The level of significance has been set by the problem at the 95% level. Because this is two-tailed test one-half of
the alpha value will be in the upper tail and one-half in the lower tail as shown on the graph. The critical value
for the normal distribution at the 95% level of confidence is 1.96. This can easily be found on the student’s ttable at the very bottom at infinite degrees of freedom remembering that at infinity the t-distribution is the normal
distribution. Of course the value can also be found on the normal table but you have go looking for one-half of 95
(0.475) inside the body of the table and then read out to the sides and top for the number of standard deviations.

100

For this case, the sample of 100 found 53 first-time borrowers were different from other borrowers. The sample
proportion, p′ = 53/100= 0.53 The test question, therefore, is : “Is 0.53 significantly different from .50?” Putting
these values into the formula for the test statistic we find that 0.53 is only 0.60 standard deviations away from .50.
This is barely off of the mean of the standard normal distribution of zero. There is virtually no difference from
the sample proportion and the hypothesized proportion in terms of standard deviations.
STEP 4: Compare the test statistic and the critical value.
The calculated value is well within the critical values of ± 1.96 standard deviations and thus we cannot reject the
null hypothesis. To reject the null hypothesis we need significant evident of difference between the hypothesized
value and the sample value. In this case the sample value is very nearly the same as the hypothesized value
measured in terms of standard deviations.
STEP 5: Reach a conclusion
The formal conclusion would be “At a 95% level of significance we cannot reject the null hypothesis that
50% of first-time borrowers have the same size loans as other borrowers”. Less formally we would say that
“There is no evidence that one-half of first-time borrowers are significantly different in loan size from other
borrowers”. Notice the length to which the conclusion goes to include all of the conditions that are attached to
the conclusion. Statisticians for all the criticism they receive, are careful to be very specific even when this seems
trivial. Statisticians cannot say more than they know and the data constrain the conclusion to be within the metes
and bounds of the data.

a hypothesis test to determine if the percentage is the same or different from 85%. The teacher samples 50 students and
39 reply that they would want to go to the zoo. For the hypothesis test, use a 1% level of significance.

A cell phone company has reason to believe that the proportion is not 30%. Before they start a big advertising

of the households have three or more cell phones.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides exact data on conductivity properties of materials.
Following are conductivity measurements for 11 randomly selected pieces of a particular type of glass.

Is there convincing evidence that the average conductivity of this type of glass is greater than one? Use a
significance level of 0.05.
Solution 9.13
Let’s follow a four-step process to answer this statistical question.
1. State the Question: We need to determine if, at a 0.05 significance level, the average conductivity of the

selected glass is greater than one. Our hypotheses will be
a. H0: μ ≤ 1
b. Ha: μ > 1
2. Plan: We are testing a sample mean without a known population standard deviation with less than 30
observations. Therefore, we need to use a Student's-t distribution. Assume the underlying population is
normal.
3. Do the calculations and draw the graph.
4. State the Conclusions: We cannot accept the null hypothesis. It is reasonable to state that the data supports
the claim that the average conductivity level is greater than one.

Example 9.14
In a study of 420,019 cell phone users, 172 of the subjects developed brain cancer. Test the claim that cell phone
users developed brain cancer at a greater rate than that for non-cell phone users (the rate of brain cancer for
non-cell phone users is 0.0340%). Since this is a critical issue, use a 0.005 significance level. Explain why the
significance level should be so low in terms of a Type I error.
Solution 9.14
1. We need to conduct a hypothesis test on the claimed cancer rate. Our hypotheses will be
a. H0: p ≤ 0.00034
b. Ha: p > 0.00034
If we commit a Type I error, we are essentially accepting a false claim. Since the claim describes cancercausing environments, we want to minimize the chances of incorrectly identifying causes of cancer.
2. We will be testing a sample proportion with x = 172 and n = 420,019. The sample is sufficiently large
because we have np' = 420,019(0.00034) = 142.8, nq' = 420,019(0.99966) = 419,876.2, two independent
outcomes, and a fixed probability of success p' = 0.00034. Thus we will be able to generalize our results to
the population.

KEY TERMS
Binomial Distribution a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from Bernoulli trials. There are a fixed number, n,
of independent trials. “Independent” means that the result of any trial (for example, trial 1) does not affect the
results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the
binomial RV Χ is defined as the number of successes in n trials. The notation is: X ~ B(n, p) μ = np and the standard
n
npq . The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is P(X = x) = ⎛⎝x⎞⎠ p x q n − x .
deviation is σ =
Central Limit Theorem Given a random variable (RV) with known mean µ and known standard deviation σ. We are

¯

sampling with size n and we are interested in two new RVs - the sample mean, X . If the size n of the sample is

¯
⎛
⎞
sufficiently large, then X ~ N ⎝µ, σ ⎠ . If the size n of the sample is sufficiently large, then the distribution of the
n

sample means will approximate a normal distribution regardless of the shape of the population. The expected value
of the mean of the sample means will equal the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the
sample means, σ , is called the standard error of the mean.

n

Confidence Interval (CI) an interval estimate for an unknown population parameter. This depends on:
• The desired confidence level.
• Information that is known about the distribution (for example, known standard deviation).
• The sample and its size.
Critical Value The t or Z value set by the researcher that measures the probability of a Type I error, α.
Hypothesis a statement about the value of a population parameter, in case of two hypotheses, the statement assumed to
be true is called the null hypothesis (notation H0) and the contradictory statement is called the alternative hypothesis
(notation Ha).
Hypothesis Testing Based on sample evidence, a procedure for determining whether the hypothesis stated is a
reasonable statement and should not be rejected, or is unreasonable and should be rejected.
Normal Distribution
a continuous random variable (RV) with pdf f (x) =

1 e
σ 2π

−(x − µ) 2
2σ 2

, where μ is the mean of

the distribution, and σ is the standard deviation, notation: X ~ N(μ, σ). If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the RV is called the
standard normal distribution.
Standard Deviation a number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how far data values are
from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and σ for population standard deviation.
Student's t-Distribution investigated and reported by William S. Gossett in 1908 and published under the pseudonym
Student. The major characteristics of the random variable (RV) are:
• It is continuous and assumes any real values.
• The pdf is symmetrical about its mean of zero. However, it is more spread out and flatter at the apex than the
normal distribution.
• It approaches the standard normal distribution as n gets larger.
• There is a "family" of t distributions: every representative of the family is completely defined by the number
of degrees of freedom which is one less than the number of data items.
Test Statistic The formula that counts the number of standard deviations on the relevant distribution that estimated
parameter is away from the hypothesized value.
Type I Error The decision is to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is true.
Type II Error The decision is not to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is false.

CHAPTER REVIEW
9.1 Null and Alternative Hypotheses
In a hypothesis test, sample data is evaluated in order to arrive at a decision about some type of claim. If certain conditions
about the sample are satisfied, then the claim can be evaluated for a population. In a hypothesis test, we:
1. Evaluate the null hypothesis, typically denoted with H0. The null is not rejected unless the hypothesis test shows
otherwise. The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ≤ or ≥)
2. Always write the alternative hypothesis, typically denoted with Ha or H1, using not equal, less than or greater
than symbols, i.e., (≠, <, or > ).
3. If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can assume there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
4. Never state that a claim is proven true or false. Keep in mind the underlying fact that hypothesis testing is based
on probability laws; therefore, we can talk only in terms of non-absolute certainties.

9.2 Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors
In every hypothesis test, the outcomes are dependent on a correct interpretation of the data. Incorrect calculations or
misunderstood summary statistics can yield errors that affect the results. A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis
is rejected. A Type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected.
The probabilities of these errors are denoted by the Greek letters α and β, for a Type I and a Type II error respectively. The
power of the test, 1 – β, quantifies the likelihood that a test will yield the correct result of a true alternative hypothesis being
accepted. A high power is desirable.

9.3 Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing
In order for a hypothesis test’s results to be generalized to a population, certain requirements must be satisfied.
When testing for a single population mean:
1. A Student's t-test should be used if the data come from a simple, random sample and the population is
approximately normally distributed, or the sample size is large, with an unknown standard deviation.
2. The normal test will work if the data come from a simple, random sample and the population is approximately
normally distributed, or the sample size is large.
When testing a single population proportion use a normal test for a single population proportion if the data comes from a
simple, random sample, fill the requirements for a binomial distribution, and the mean number of success and the mean
number of failures satisfy the conditions: np > 5 and nq > n where n is the sample size, p is the probability of a success, and
q is the probability of a failure.

9.4 Full Hypothesis Test Examples
The hypothesis test itself has an established process. This can be summarized as follows:
1. Determine H0 and Ha. Remember, they are contradictory.
2. Determine the random variable.
3. Determine the distribution for the test.
4. Draw a graph and calculate the test statistic.
5. Compare the calculated test statistic with the Z critical value determined by the level of significance required by
the test and make a decision (cannot reject H0 or cannot accept H0), and write a clear conclusion using English
sentences.

personnel team believe that the mean number is ten?
61. In 1955, Life Magazine reported that the 25 year-old mother of three worked, on average, an 80 hour week. Recently,
many groups have been studying whether or not the women's movement has, in fact, resulted in an increase in the average
work week for women (combining employment and at-home work). Suppose a study was done to determine if the mean
work week has increased. 81 women were surveyed with the following results. The sample mean was 83; the sample
standard deviation was ten. Does it appear that the mean work week has increased for women at the 5% level?
62. Your statistics instructor claims that 60 percent of the students who take her Elementary Statistics class go through life
feeling more enriched. For some reason that she can't quite figure out, most people don't believe her. You decide to check
this out on your own. You randomly survey 64 of her past Elementary Statistics students and find that 34 feel more enriched
as a result of her class. Now, what do you think?
63. A Nissan Motor Corporation advertisement read, “The average man’s I.Q. is 107. The average brown trout’s I.Q. is 4.
So why can’t man catch brown trout?” Suppose you believe that the brown trout’s mean I.Q. is greater than four. You catch
12 brown trout. A fish psychologist determines the I.Q.s as follows: 5; 4; 7; 3; 6; 4; 5; 3; 6; 3; 8; 5. Conduct a hypothesis
test of your belief.

64. Refer to Exercise 9.119. Conduct a hypothesis test to see if your decision and conclusion would change if your belief
were that the brown trout’s mean I.Q. is not four.
65. According to an article in Newsweek, the natural ratio of girls to boys is 100:105. In China, the birth ratio is 100: 114
(46.7% girls). Suppose you don’t believe the reported figures of the percent of girls born in China. You conduct a study.
In this study, you count the number of girls and boys born in 150 randomly chosen recent births. There are 60 girls and 90
boys born of the 150. Based on your study, do you believe that the percent of girls born in China is 46.7?
66. A poll done for Newsweek found that 13% of Americans have seen or sensed the presence of an angel. A contingent
doubts that the percent is really that high. It conducts its own survey. Out of 76 Americans surveyed, only two had seen
or sensed the presence of an angel. As a result of the contingent’s survey, would you agree with the Newsweek poll? In
complete sentences, also give three reasons why the two polls might give different results.
67. The mean work week for engineers in a start-up company is believed to be about 60 hours. A newly hired engineer
hopes that it’s shorter. She asks ten engineering friends in start-ups for the lengths of their mean work weeks. Based on the
results that follow, should she count on the mean work week to be shorter than 60 hours?
Data (length of mean work week): 70; 45; 55; 60; 65; 55; 55; 60; 50; 55.
68. Sixty-eight percent of online courses taught at community colleges nationwide were taught by full-time faculty. To
test if 68% also represents California’s percent for full-time faculty teaching the online classes, Long Beach City College
(LBCC) in California, was randomly selected for comparison. In the same year, 34 of the 44 online courses LBCC offered
were taught by full-time faculty. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if 68% represents California. NOTE: For more
accurate results, use more California community colleges and this past year's data.
69. According to an article in Bloomberg Businessweek, New York City's most recent adult smoking rate is 14%. Suppose
that a survey is conducted to determine this year’s rate. Nine out of 70 randomly chosen N.Y. City residents reply that they
smoke. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the rate is still 14% or if it has decreased.
70. The mean age of De Anza College students in a previous term was 26.6 years old. An instructor thinks the mean age
for online students is older than 26.6. She randomly surveys 56 online students and finds that the sample mean is 29.4 with
a standard deviation of 2.1. Conduct a hypothesis test.
71. Registered nurses earned an average annual salary of $69,110. For that same year, a survey was conducted of 41
California registered nurses to determine if the annual salary is higher than $69,110 for California nurses. The sample
average was $71,121 with a sample standard deviation of $7,489. Conduct a hypothesis test.
72. La Leche League International reports that the mean age of weaning a child from breastfeeding is age four to five
worldwide. In America, most nursing mothers wean their children much earlier. Suppose a random survey is conducted of
21 U.S. mothers who recently weaned their children. The mean weaning age was nine months (3/4 year) with a standard
deviation of 4 months. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weaning age in the U.S. is less than four years
old.
73. Over the past few decades, public health officials have examined the link between weight concerns and teen girls'
smoking. Researchers surveyed a group of 273 randomly selected teen girls living in Massachusetts (between 12 and 15
years old). After four years the girls were surveyed again. Sixty-three said they smoked to stay thin. Is there good evidence
that more than thirty percent of the teen girls smoke to stay thin?
After conducting the test, your decision and conclusion are
a. Reject H0: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that more than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin.
b. Do not reject H0: There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that less than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin.
c. Do not reject H0: There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that more than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin.
d. Reject H0: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that less than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin.

74. A statistics instructor believes that fewer than 20% of Evergreen Valley College (EVC) students attended the opening
night midnight showing of the latest Harry Potter movie. She surveys 84 of her students and finds that 11 of them attended
the midnight showing.
At a 1% level of significance, an appropriate conclusion is:
a. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the percent of EVC students who attended the midnight showing
of Harry Potter is less than 20%.
b. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the percent of EVC students who attended the midnight showing of
Harry Potter is more than 20%.
c. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the percent of EVC students who attended the midnight showing of
Harry Potter is less than 20%.
d. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the percent of EVC students who attended the midnight showing
of Harry Potter is at least 20%.
75. Previously, an organization reported that teenagers spent 4.5 hours per week, on average, on the phone. The organization
thinks that, currently, the mean is higher. Fifteen randomly chosen teenagers were asked how many hours per week they
spend on the phone. The sample mean was 4.75 hours with a sample standard deviation of 2.0. Conduct a hypothesis test.
At a significance level of a = 0.05, what is the correct conclusion?
a. There is enough evidence to conclude that the mean number of hours is more than 4.75
b. There is enough evidence to conclude that the mean number of hours is more than 4.5
c. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean number of hours is more than 4.5
d. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean number of hours is more than 4.75

e. Write a conclusion.
f. Answer any other questions asked in the problem.
76. According to the Center for Disease Control website, in 2011 at least 18% of high school students have smoked a
cigarette. An Introduction to Statistics class in Davies County, KY conducted a hypothesis test at the local high school (a
medium sized–approximately 1,200 students–small city demographic) to determine if the local high school’s percentage
was lower. One hundred fifty students were chosen at random and surveyed. Of the 150 students surveyed, 82 have
smoked. Use a significance level of 0.05 and using appropriate statistical evidence, conduct a hypothesis test and state the
conclusions.
77. A recent survey in the N.Y. Times Almanac indicated that 48.8% of families own stock. A broker wanted to determine
if this survey could be valid. He surveyed a random sample of 250 families and found that 142 owned some type of stock.
At the 0.05 significance level, can the survey be considered to be accurate?
78. Driver error can be listed as the cause of approximately 54% of all fatal auto accidents, according to the American
Automobile Association. Thirty randomly selected fatal accidents are examined, and it is determined that 14 were caused
by driver error. Using α = 0.05, is the AAA proportion accurate?
79. The US Department of Energy reported that 51.7% of homes were heated by natural gas. A random sample of 221
homes in Kentucky found that 115 were heated by natural gas. Does the evidence support the claim for Kentucky at the α =
0.05 level in Kentucky? Are the results applicable across the country? Why?
80. For Americans using library services, the American Library Association claims that at most 67% of patrons borrow
books. The library director in Owensboro, Kentucky feels this is not true, so she asked a local college statistic class to
conduct a survey. The class randomly selected 100 patrons and found that 82 borrowed books. Did the class demonstrate
that the percentage was higher in Owensboro, KY? Use α = 0.01 level of significance. What is the possible proportion of
patrons that do borrow books from the Owensboro Library?

81. The Weather Underground reported that the mean amount of summer rainfall for the northeastern US is at least 11.52
inches. Ten cities in the northeast are randomly selected and the mean rainfall amount is calculated to be 7.42 inches with
a standard deviation of 1.3 inches. At the α = 0.05 level, can it be concluded that the mean rainfall was below the reported
average? What if α = 0.01? Assume the amount of summer rainfall follows a normal distribution.
82. A survey in the N.Y. Times Almanac finds the mean commute time (one way) is 25.4 minutes for the 15 largest US
cities. The Austin, TX chamber of commerce feels that Austin’s commute time is less and wants to publicize this fact. The
mean for 25 randomly selected commuters is 22.1 minutes with a standard deviation of 5.3 minutes. At the α = 0.10 level,
is the Austin, TX commute significantly less than the mean commute time for the 15 largest US cities?
83. A report by the Gallup Poll found that a woman visits her doctor, on average, at most 5.8 times each year. A random
sample of 20 women results in these yearly visit totals
3; 2; 1; 3; 7; 2; 9; 4; 6; 6; 8; 0; 5; 6; 4; 2; 1; 3; 4; 1
At the α = 0.05 level can it be concluded that the sample mean is higher than 5.8 visits per year?
84. According to the N.Y. Times Almanac the mean family size in the U.S. is 3.18. A sample of a college math class resulted
in the following family sizes:
5; 4; 5; 4; 4; 3; 6; 4; 3; 3; 5; 5; 6; 3; 3; 2; 7; 4; 5; 2; 2; 2; 3; 2
At α = 0.05 level, is the class’ mean family size greater than the national average? Does the Almanac result remain valid?
Why?
85. The student academic group on a college campus claims that freshman students study at least 2.5 hours per day, on
average. One Introduction to Statistics class was skeptical. The class took a random sample of 30 freshman students and
found a mean study time of 137 minutes with a standard deviation of 45 minutes. At α = 0.01 level, is the student academic
group’s claim correct?

10 | HYPOTHESIS
TESTING WITH TWO
SAMPLES

Figure 10.1 If you want to test a claim that involves two groups (the types of breakfasts eaten east and west of the
Mississippi River) you can use a slightly different technique when conducting a hypothesis test. (credit: Chloe Lim)

Introduction
Studies often compare two groups. For example, researchers are interested in the effect aspirin has in preventing heart
attacks. Over the last few years, newspapers and magazines have reported various aspirin studies involving two groups.
Typically, one group is given aspirin and the other group is given a placebo. Then, the heart attack rate is studied over
several years.
There are other situations that deal with the comparison of two groups. For example, studies compare various diet and
exercise programs. Politicians compare the proportion of individuals from different income brackets who might vote for
them. Students are interested in whether SAT or GRE preparatory courses really help raise their scores. Many business
applications require comparing two groups. It may be the investment returns of two different investment strategies, or the
differences in production efficiency of different management styles.
To compare two means or two proportions, you work with two groups. The groups are classified either as independent or
matched pairs. Independent groups consist of two samples that are independent, that is, sample values selected from one

420

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

population are not related in any way to sample values selected from the other population. Matched pairs consist of two
samples that are dependent. The parameter tested using matched pairs is the population mean. The parameters tested using
independent groups are either population means or population proportions of each group.

10.1 | Comparing Two Independent Population Means
The comparison of two independent population means is very common and provides a way to test the hypothesis that the
two groups differ from each other. Is the night shift less productive than the day shift, are the rates of return from fixed
asset investments different from those from common stock investments, and so on? An observed difference between two
sample means depends on both the means and the sample standard deviations. Very different means can occur by chance if
there is great variation among the individual samples. The test statistic will have to account for this fact. The test comparing
two independent population means with unknown and possibly unequal population standard deviations is called the AspinWelch t-test. The degrees of freedom formula we will see later was developed by Aspin-Welch.
When we developed the hypothesis test for the mean and proportions we began with the Central Limit Theorem. We
recognized that a sample mean came from a distribution of sample means, and sample proportions came from the sampling
distribution of sample proportions. This made our sample parameters, the sample means and sample proportions, into
random variables. It was important for us to know the distribution that these random variables came from. The Central Limit
Theorem gave us the answer: the normal distribution. Our Z and t statistics came from this theorem. This provided us with
the solution to our question of how to measure the probability that a sample mean came from a distribution with a particular
hypothesized value of the mean or proportion. In both cases that was the question: what is the probability that the mean (or
proportion) from our sample data came from a population distribution with the hypothesized value we are interested in?
Now we are interested in whether or not two samples have the same mean. Our question has not changed: Do these two
samples come from the same population distribution? To approach this problem we create a new random variable. We
recognize that we have two sample means, one from each set of data, and thus we have two random variables coming
from two unknown distributions. To solve the problem we create a new random variable, the difference between the sample
means. This new random variable also has a distribution and, again, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that this new
distribution is normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distributions of the original data. A graph may help to
understand this concept.

Figure 10.2

Pictured are two distributions of data, X1 and X2, with unknown means and standard deviations. The second panel shows
the sampling distribution of the newly created random variable ( X 1 - X 2 ). This distribution is the theoretical distribution
of many many sample means from population 1 minus sample means from population 2. The Central Limit Theorem
tells us that this theoretical sampling distribution of differences in sample means is normally distributed, regardless of the
distribution of the actual population data shown in the top panel. Because the sampling distribution is normally distributed,
we can develop a standardizing formula and calculate probabilities from the standard normal distribution in the bottom
panel, the Z distribution. We have seen this same analysis before in Chapter 7 Figure 7.2 .
The Central Limit Theorem, as before, provides us with the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, and further,
that the expected value of the mean of the distribution of differences in sample means is equal to the differences in the
population means. Mathematically this can be stated:
⎛

⎞

E⎝µ x- - µ x- ⎠ = µ 1 - µ 2
1
2
Because we do not know the population standard deviations, we estimate them using the two sample standard deviations
from our independent samples. For the hypothesis test, we calculate the estimated standard deviation, or standard error,

¯

¯

of the difference in sample means, X 1 – X 2 .
The standard error is:

(s 1 ) 2 (s 2 ) 2
n1 + n2
We remember that substituting the sample variance for the population variance when we did not have the population
variance was the technique we used when building the confidence interval and the test statistic for the test of hypothesis for
a single mean back in Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing with One Sample. The test statistic (t-score)

422

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

is calculated as follows:

tc =

( x̄ 1 – x̄ 2 ) – δ 0
(s 1 ) 2
n1

+

(s 2 ) 2
n2

where:
• s1 and s2, the sample standard deviations, are estimates of σ1 and σ2, respectively and
• σ1 and σ1 are the unknown population standard deviations.
•

x̄ 1 and x̄ 2 are the sample means. μ1 and μ2 are the unknown population means.

The number of degrees of freedom (df) requires a somewhat complicated calculation. The df are not always a whole
number. The test statistic above is approximated by the Student's t-distribution with df as follows:
Degrees of freedom

2
⎛ (s ) 2
(s ) 2 ⎞
⎜ n1 + n2 ⎟
2 ⎠
⎝ 1
df =
2
2
⎛ 1 ⎞⎛⎜ (s 1) 2 ⎞⎟
⎛ 1 ⎞⎛⎜ (s 2) 2 ⎞⎟
⎝n 1 – 1 ⎠⎝ n 1 ⎠ + ⎝n 2 – 1 ⎠⎝ n 2 ⎠

When both sample sizes n1 and n2 are 30 or larger, the Student's t approximation is very good. If each sample has more than
30 observations then the degrees of freedom can be calculated as n1 + n2 - 2.
The format of the sampling distribution, differences in sample means, specifies that the format of the null and alternative
hypothesis is:

H0 : µ1 - µ2 = δ0
Ha : µ1 - µ2 ≠ δ0

where δ0 is the hypothesized difference between the two means. If the question is simply “is there any difference between
the means?” then δ0 = 0 and the null and alternative hypotheses becomes:

H0 : µ1 = µ2
Ha : µ1 ≠ µ2

An example of when δ0 might not be zero is when the comparison of the two groups requires a specific difference for
the decision to be meaningful. Imagine that you are making a capital investment. You are considering changing from your
current model machine to another. You measure the productivity of your machines by the speed they produce the product.
It may be that a contender to replace the old model is faster in terms of product throughput, but is also more expensive. The
second machine may also have more maintenance costs, setup costs, etc. The null hypothesis would be set up so that the
new machine would have to be better than the old one by enough to cover these extra costs in terms of speed and cost of
production. This form of the null and alternative hypothesis shows how valuable this particular hypothesis test can be. For
most of our work we will be testing simple hypotheses asking if there is any difference between the two distribution means.

Example 10.1 Independent groups
The Kona Iki Corporation produces coconut milk. They take coconuts and extract the milk inside by drilling a
hole and pouring the milk into a vat for processing. They have both a day shift (called the B shift) and a night
shift (called the G shift) to do this part of the process. They would like to know if the day shift and the night shift
are equally efficient in processing the coconuts. A study is done sampling 9 shifts of the G shift and 16 shifts of
the B shift. The results of the number of hours required to process 100 pounds of coconuts is presented in Table
10.1. A study is done and data are collected, resulting in the data in Table 10.1.

Table 10.1

Is there a difference in the mean amount of time for each shift to process 100 pounds of coconuts? Test at the 5%
level of significance.
Solution 10.1
The population standard deviations are not known and cannot be assumed to equal each other. Let g be the
subscript for the G Shift and b be the subscript for the B Shift. Then, μg is the population mean for G Shift and μb
is the population mean for B Shift. This is a test of two independent groups, two population means.

¯

Random variable: X g − X b = difference in the sample mean amount of time between the G Shift and the B
Shift takes to process the coconuts.
H 0: μ g = μ b
H 0: μ g – μ b = 0
H a: μ g ≠ μ b
H a: μ g – μ b ≠ 0
The words "the same" tell you H0 has an "=". Since there are no other words to indicate Ha, is either faster or
slower. This is a two tailed test.
Distribution for the test: Use tdf where df is calculated using the df formula for independent groups, two
population means above. Using a calculator, df is approximately 18.8462.

We next find the critical value on the t-table using the degrees of freedom from above. The critical value, 2.093,
is found in the .025 column, this is α/2, at 19 degrees of freedom. (The convention is to round up the degrees
of freedom to make the conclusion more conservative.) Next we calculate the test statistic and mark this on the
t-distribution graph.
Make a decision: Since the calculated t-value is in the tail we cannot accept the null hypothesis that there is no
difference between the two groups. The means are different.
The graph has included the sampling distribution of the differences in the sample means to show how the tdistribution aligns with the sampling distribution data. We see in the top panel that the calculated difference in the
two means is -1.2 and the bottom panel shows that this is 3.01 standard deviations from the mean. Typically we do
not need to show the sampling distribution graph and can rely on the graph of the test statistic, the t-distribution
in this case, to reach our conclusion.
Conclusion: At the 5% level of significance, the sample data show there is sufficient evidence to conclude that
the mean number of hours that the G Shift takes to process 100 pounds of coconuts is different from the B Shift
(mean number of hours for the B Shift is greater than the mean number of hours for the G Shift).

NOTE
When the sum of the sample sizes is larger than 30 (n1 + n2 > 30) you can use the normal distribution to approximate
the Student's t.

Example 10.2
A study is done to determine if Company A retains its workers longer than Company B. It is believed that
Company A has a higher retention than Company B. The study finds that in a sample of 11 workers at Company
A their average time with the company is four years with a standard deviation of 1.5 years. A sample of 9 workers
at Company B finds that the average time with the company was 3.5 years with a standard deviation of 1 year.

it is to reject a null hypothesis with a very small sample. The critical values require very large test statistics to
reach the tail.

i. At the 1% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the
retention of workers at Company A is longer than Company B, on average.

Example 10.3
An interesting research question is the effect, if any, that different types of teaching formats have on the grade
outcomes of students. To investigate this issue one sample of students' grades was taken from a hybrid class and
another sample taken from a standard lecture format class. Both classes were for the same subject. The mean
course grade in percent for the 35 hybrid students is 74 with a standard deviation of 16. The mean grades of the
40 students form the standard lecture class was 76 percent with a standard deviation of 9. Test at 5% to see if there
is any significant difference in the population mean grades between standard lecture course and hybrid class.

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

427

Solution 10.3
We begin by noting that we have two groups, students from a hybrid class and students from a standard lecture
format class. We also note that the random variable, what we are interested in, is students' grades, a continuous
random variable. We could have asked the research question in a different way and had a binary random variable.
For example, we could have studied the percentage of students with a failing grade, or with an A grade. Both of
these would be binary and thus a test of proportions and not a test of means as is the case here. Finally, there is no
presumption as to which format might lead to higher grades so the hypothesis is stated as a two-tailed test.
H 0: µ 1 = µ 2
Ha : µ1 ≠ µ2
As would virtually always be the case, we do not know the population variances of the two distributions and thus
our test statistic is:

tc =

¯ ⎞
⎛¯

=

(74 − 76) − 0

+ 940

= −0.65

To determine the critical value of the Student's t we need the degrees of freedom. For this case we use: df = n1
+ n2 - 2 = 35 + 40 -2 = 73. This is large enough to consider it the normal distribution thus ta/2 = 1.96. Again as
always we determine if the calculated value is in the tail determined by the critical value. In this case we do not
even need to look up the critical value: the calculated value of the difference in these two average grades is not
even one standard deviation apart. Certainly not in the tail.
Conclusion: Cannot reject the null at α=5%. Therefore, evidence does not exist to prove that the grades in
hybrid and standard classes differ.

10.2 | Cohen's Standards for Small, Medium, and Large
Effect Sizes
Cohen's d is a measure of "effect size" based on the differences between two means. Cohen’s d, named for United States
statistician Jacob Cohen, measures the relative strength of the differences between the means of two populations based on
sample data. The calculated value of effect size is then compared to Cohen’s standards of small, medium, and large effect
sizes.

pooled

where s pooled =

(n 1 – 1)s 21 + (n 2 – 1)s 22
n1 + n2 – 2

It is important to note that Cohen's d does not provide a level of confidence as to the magnitude of the size of the effect
comparable to the other tests of hypothesis we have studied. The sizes of the effects are simply indicative.

428

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

Example 10.4
Calculate Cohen’s d for ???. Is the size of the effect small, medium, or large? Explain what the size of the effect
means for this problem.
Solution 10.4
x̅1 = 4 s1 = 1.5 n1 = 11
x̅2 = 3.5 s2 = 1 n2 = 9
d = 0.384
The effect is small because 0.384 is between Cohen’s value of 0.2 for small effect size and 0.5 for medium
effect size. The size of the differences of the means for the two companies is small indicating that there is not a
significant difference between them.

10.3 | Test for Differences in Means: Assuming Equal
Population Variances
Typically we can never expect to know any of the population parameters, mean, proportion, or standard deviation. When
testing hypotheses concerning differences in means we are faced with the difficulty of two unknown variances that play a
critical role in the test statistic. We have been substituting the sample variances just as we did when testing hypotheses for
a single mean. And as we did before, we used a Student's t to compensate for this lack of information on the population
variance. There may be situations, however, when we do not know the population variances, but we can assume that the
two populations have the same variance. If this is true then the pooled sample variance will be smaller than the individual
sample variances. This will give more precise estimates and reduce the probability of discarding a good null. The null and
alternative hypotheses remain the same, but the test statistic changes to:

tc =

¯ ⎞
⎛¯
⎝ x 1 − x 2⎠ − δ 0
2⎛

⎞

Sp⎝n1 + n1 ⎠

where Sp is the pooled variance given by the formula:
2

Sp =

⎛
⎝n 1

− 1⎞⎠s 12 + ⎛⎝n 2 − 1⎞⎠s 22
n1 + n2 − 2

Example 10.5
A drug trial is attempted using a real drug and a pill made of just sugar. 18 people are given the real drug
in hopes of increasing the production of endorphins. The increase in endorphins is found to be on average 8
micrograms per person, and the sample standard deviation is 5.4 micrograms. 11 people are given the sugar pill,
and their average endorphin increase is 4 micrograms with a standard deviation of 2.4. From previous research
on endorphins it is determined that it can be assumed that the variances within the two samples can be assumed
to be the same. Test at 5% to see if the population mean for the real drug had a significantly greater impact on the
endorphins than the population mean with the sugar pill.
Solution 10.5
First we begin by designating one of the two groups Group 1 and the other Group 2. This will be needed to keep
track of the null and alternative hypotheses. Let's set Group 1 as those who received the actual new medicine
being tested and therefore Group 2 is those who received the sugar pill. We can now set up the null and alternative
hypothesis as:

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

429

H 0: µ 1 ≤ µ 2
H 1: µ 1 > µ 2
This is set up as a one-tailed test with the claim in the alternative hypothesis that the medicine will produce
more endorphins than the sugar pill. We now calculate the test statistic which requires us to calculate the pooled
2

variance, Sp using the formula above.

tα, allows us to compare the test statistic and the critical value.

t α = 1.703 at d f = n 1 + n 2 − 2 = 18 + 11 − 2 = 27
The test statistic is clearly in the tail, 2.31 is larger than the critical value of 1.703, and therefore we cannot
maintain the null hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that there is significant evidence at the 95% level of confidence
that the new medicine produces the effect desired.

10.4 | Comparing Two Independent Population
Proportions
When conducting a hypothesis test that compares two independent population proportions, the following characteristics
should be present:
1. The two independent samples are random samples that are independent.
2. The number of successes is at least five, and the number of failures is at least five, for each of the samples.
3. Growing literature states that the population must be at least ten or even perhaps 20 times the size of the sample. This
keeps each population from being over-sampled and causing biased results.
Comparing two proportions, like comparing two means, is common. If two estimated proportions are different, it may be
due to a difference in the populations or it may be due to chance in the sampling. A hypothesis test can help determine if a
difference in the estimated proportions reflects a difference in the two population proportions.
Like the case of differences in sample means, we construct a sampling distribution for differences in sample proportions:
⎛ '
' ⎞
'
'
⎝ p A - p B⎠ where p A = X A and p B = X B are the sample proportions for the two sets of data in question. XA and XB
nA

nB

are the number of successes in each sample group respectively, and nA and nB are the respective sample sizes from the two
groups. Again we go the Central Limit theorem to find the distribution of this sampling distribution for the differences in
sample proportions. And again we find that this sampling distribution, like the ones past, are normally distributed as proved
by the Central Limit Theorem, as seen in Figure 10.5 .

430

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

Generally, the null hypothesis allows for the test of a difference of a particular value, 𝛿0, just as we did for the case of
differences in means.

H0 : p1 − p2 = 𝛿

0

H1 : p1 − p2 ≠ 𝛿

0

Most common, however, is the test that the two proportions are the same. That is,

H0 : pA = pB
Ha : pA ≠ pB
To conduct the test, we use a pooled proportion, pc.
The pooled proportion is calculated as follows:

p c = n A + nB
B
A

The test statistic (z-score) is:

Zc =

(p′A − p′B) − δ0

p c(1 − p c)( n1 + n1 )
A

B

where δ0 is the hypothesized differences between the two proportions and pc is the pooled variance from the formula above.

Example 10.6
A bank has recently acquired a new branch and thus has customers in this new territory. They are interested in
the default rate in their new territory. They wish to test the hypothesis that the default rate is different from their
current customer base. They sample 200 files in area A, their current customers, and find that 20 have defaulted.
In area B, the new customers, another sample of 200 files shows 12 have defaulted on their loans. At a 10% level
of significance can we say that the default rates are the same or different?
Solution 10.6
This is a test of proportions. We know this because the underlying random variable is binary, default or not
default. Further, we know it is a test of differences in proportions because we have two sample groups, the current
customer base and the newly acquired customer base. Let A and B be the subscripts for the two customer groups.
Then pA and pB are the two population proportions we wish to test.
Random Variable:
P′A – P′B = difference in the proportions of customers who defaulted in the two groups.

H0 : p A = pB
Ha : p A ≠ pB
The words "is a difference" tell you the test is two-tailed.
Distribution for the test: Since this is a test of two binomial population proportions, the distribution is normal:

x +x
p c = n A + n B = 20 + 12 = 0.08 1 – p c = 0.92
200 + 200

(p′A – p′B) = 0.04 follows an approximate normal distribution.

The estimated difference between the two groups is : p′A – p′B = 0.1 – 0.06 = 0.04.

Conclusion: At a 1% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that
there is a difference between the proportions of customers who defaulted in the two groups.

Two types of valves are being tested to determine if there is a difference in pressure tolerances. Fifteen out of

10.5 | Two Population Means with Known Standard
Deviations
Even though this situation is not likely (knowing the population standard deviations is very unlikely), the following example
illustrates hypothesis testing for independent means with known population standard deviations. The sampling distribution
for the difference between the means is normal in accordance with the central limit theorem. The random variable is
–

X 1 – X 2 . The normal distribution has the following format:
The standard deviation is:

The words "is more effective" says that wax 1 lasts longer than wax 2, on average. "Longer" is a “>” symbol
and goes into Ha. Therefore, this is a right-tailed test.
Distribution for the test: The population standard deviations are known so the distribution is normal. Using the
formula for the test statistic we find the calculated value for the problem.

the calculate value is not in the tail therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

An interested citizen wanted to know if Democratic U. S. senators are older than Republican U.S. senators, on
average. On May 26 2013, the mean age of 30 randomly selected Republican Senators was 61 years 247 days
old (61.675 years) with a standard deviation of 10.17 years. The mean age of 30 randomly selected Democratic
senators was 61 years 257 days old (61.704 years) with a standard deviation of 9.55 years.

Do the data indicate that Democratic senators are older than Republican senators, on average? Test at a 5% level
of significance.
Solution 10.8
This is a test of two independent groups, two population means. The population standard deviations are unknown,
but the sum of the sample sizes is 30 + 30 = 60, which is greater than 30, so we can use the normal approximation
to the Student’s-t distribution. Subscripts: 1: Democratic senators 2: Republican senators

–

–

Random variable: X 1 – X 2 = difference in the mean age of Democratic and Republican U.S. senators.

H0 : µ 1 ≤ µ 2 H0 : µ 1 - µ 2 ≤ 0
Ha : µ 1 > µ 2 Ha : µ 1 - µ 2 > 0
The words "older than" translates as a “>” symbol and goes into Ha. Therefore, this is a right-tailed test.

Figure 10.8

Make a decision: The p-value is larger than 5%, therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis. By calculating
the test statistic we would find that the test statistic does not fall in the tail, therefore we cannot reject the null
hypothesis. We reach the same conclusion using either method of a making this statistical decision.
Conclusion: At the 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude
that the mean age of Democratic senators is greater than the mean age of the Republican senators.

10.6 | Matched or Paired Samples
In most cases of economic or business data we have little or no control over the process of how the data are gathered. In this
sense the data are not the result of a planned controlled experiment. In some cases, however, we can develop data that are
part of a controlled experiment. This situation occurs frequently in quality control situations. Imagine that the production
rates of two machines built to the same design, but at different manufacturing plants, are being tested for differences in
some production metric such as speed of output or meeting some production specification such as strength of the product.
The test is the same in format to what we have been testing, but here we can have matched pairs for which we can test if

436

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

differences exist. Each observation has its matched pair against which differences are calculated. First, the differences in
the metric to be tested between the two lists of observations must be calculated, and this is typically labeled with the letter
¯

"d." Then, the average of these matched differences, X d is calculated as is its standard deviation, Sd. We expect that the
standard deviation of the differences of the matched pairs will be smaller than unmatched pairs because presumably fewer
differences should exist because of the correlation between the two groups.
When using a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, the following characteristics may be present:
1. Simple random sampling is used.
2. Sample sizes are often small.
3. Two measurements (samples) are drawn from the same pair of individuals or objects.
4. Differences are calculated from the matched or paired samples.
5. The differences form the sample that is used for the hypothesis test.
6. Either the matched pairs have differences that come from a population that is normal or the number of differences is
sufficiently large so that distribution of the sample mean of differences is approximately normal.
In a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, subjects are matched in pairs and differences are calculated. The
differences are the data. The population mean for the differences, μd, is then tested using a Student's-t test for a single
population mean with n – 1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of differences, that is, the number of pairs not the
number of observations.
The null and alternative hypotheses for this test are:

H0 : µd = 0
Ha : µd ≠ 0

The test statistic is:

tc =

–x − µ
d
d
⎛s d ⎞
⎝ n⎠

Example 10.9
A company has developed a training program for its entering employees because they have become concerned
with the results of the six-month employee review. They hope that the training program can result in better sixmonth reviews. Each trainee constitutes a “pair”, the entering score the employee received when first entering
the firm and the score given at the six-month review. The difference in the two scores were calculated for each
employee and the means for before and after the training program was calculated. The sample mean before the
training program was 20.4 and the sample mean after the training program was 23.9. The standard deviation of
the differences in the two scores across the 20 employees was 3.8 points. Test at the 10% significance level the
null hypothesis that the two population means are equal against the alternative that the training program helps
improve the employees’ scores.
Solution 10.9
The first step is to identify this as a two sample case: before the training and after the training. This differentiates
this problem from simple one sample issues. Second, we determine that the two samples are "paired." Each
observation in the first sample has a paired observation in the second sample. This information tells us that the
null and alternative hypotheses should be:

H0 : µd ≤ 0
Ha : µd > 0

This form reflects the implied claim that the training course improves scores; the test is one-tailed and the claim
is in the alternative hypothesis. Because the experiment was conducted as a matched paired sample rather than
simply taking scores from people who took the training course those who didn't, we use the matched pair test
statistic:

⎛ 3.8 ⎞

In order to solve this equation, the individual scores, pre-training course and post-training course need to be used
to calculate the individual differences. These scores are then averaged and the average difference is calculated:

Xd = x 1 − x 2
From these differences we can calculate the standard deviation across the individual differences:

Sd =

⎛
Σ ⎝d i − X d ⎠

where d i = x 1i − x 2i

We can now compare the calculated value of the test statistic, 4.12, with the critical value. The critical value is a
Student's t with degrees of freedom equal to the number of pairs, not observations, minus 1. In this case 20 pairs
and at 90% confidence level ta/2 = ±1.729 at df = 20 - 1 = 19. The calculated test statistic is most certainly in the
tail of the distribution and thus we cannot accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference from the training
program. Evidence seems indicate that the training aids employees in gaining higher scores.

Example 10.10
A study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of hypnotism in reducing pain. Results for randomly
selected subjects are shown in Table 10.4. A lower score indicates less pain. The "before" value is matched
to an "after" value and the differences are calculated. Are the sensory measurements, on average, lower after
hypnotism? Test at a 5% significance level.

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

The data for the test are the differences: {0.2, –4.1, –1.6, –1.8, –3.2, –2, –2.9, –9.6}
–

The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the differences are: x d = –3.13 and s d = 2.91 Verify these
values.
Let µ d be the population mean for the differences. We use the subscript d to denote "differences."

–

Random variable: X d = the mean difference of the sensory measurements
H 0: μ d ≥ 0
The null hypothesis is zero or positive, meaning that there is the same or more pain felt after hypnotism. That
means the subject shows no improvement. μd is the population mean of the differences.)
H a: μ d < 0
The alternative hypothesis is negative, meaning there is less pain felt after hypnotism. That means the subject
shows improvement. The score should be lower after hypnotism, so the difference ought to be negative to indicate
improvement.
Distribution for the test: The distribution is a Student's t with df = n – 1 = 8 – 1 = 7. Use t7. (Notice that the
test is for a single population mean.)
Calculate the test statistic and look up the critical value using the Student's-t distribution: The calculated
value of the test statistic is 3.06 and the critical value of the t distribution with 7 degrees of freedom at the 5%
level of confidence is 1.895 with a one-tailed test.

The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the differences are:

Compare the critical value for alpha against the calculated test statistic.
The conclusion from using the comparison of the calculated test statistic and the critical value will gives us the
result. In this question the calculated test statistic is 3.06 and the critical value is 1.895. The test statistic is clearly
in the tail and thus we cannot accept the null hypotheses that there is no difference between the two situations,
hypnotized and not hypnotized.
Make a decision: Cannot accept the null hypothesis, H0. This means that μd < 0 and there is a statistically
significant improvement.

Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that
the sensory measurements, on average, are lower after hypnotism. Hypnotism appears to be effective in reducing
pain.

Example 10.11
A college football coach was interested in whether the college's strength development class increased his players'
maximum lift (in pounds) on the bench press exercise. He asked four of his players to participate in a study.
The amount of weight they could each lift was recorded before they took the strength development class. After
completing the class, the amount of weight they could each lift was again measured. The data are as follows:

Weight (in pounds)

Player 1

Player 2

Player 3

Player 4

Amount of weight lifted prior to the class 205

241

338

368

Amount of weight lifted after the class

252

330

360

295

Table 10.7

The coach wants to know if the strength development class makes his players stronger, on average.
Record the differences data. Calculate the differences by subtracting the amount of weight lifted prior to the class
from the weight lifted after completing the class. The data for the differences are: {90, 11, -8, -8}.

–x

d = 21.3, sd = 46.7

Using the difference data, this becomes a test of a single mean.

–

Define the random variable: X d mean difference in the maximum lift per player.
The distribution for the hypothesis test is a student's t with 3 degrees of freedom.
H0: μd ≤ 0, Ha: μd > 0

Figure 10.10

Calculate the test statistic look up the critical value: Critical value of the test statistic is 0.91. The critical value
of the student's t at 5% level of significance and 3 degrees of freedom is 2.353.
Decision: If the level of significance is 5%, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, because the calculated value of
the test statistic is not in the tail.
What is the conclusion?
At a 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the strength
development class helped to make the players stronger, on average.

KEY TERMS
Cohen’s d a measure of effect size based on the differences between two means. If d is between 0 and 0.2 then the effect
is small. If d approaches is 0.5, then the effect is medium, and if d approaches 0.8, then it is a large effect.
Independent Groups two samples that are selected from two populations, and the values from one population are not
related in any way to the values from the other population.
Matched Pairs two samples that are dependent. Differences between a before and after scenario are tested by testing
one population mean of differences.
Pooled Variance a weighted average of two variances that can then be used when calculating standard error.

CHAPTER REVIEW
10.1 Comparing Two Independent Population Means
Two population means from independent samples where the population standard deviations are not known

–

–

• Random Variable: X 1 − X 2 = the difference of the sampling means
• Distribution: Student's t-distribution with degrees of freedom (variances not pooled)

10.2 Cohen's Standards for Small, Medium, and Large Effect Sizes
Cohen's d is a measure of “effect size” based on the differences between two means.
It is important to note that Cohen's d does not provide a level of confidence as to the magnitude of the size of the effect
comparable to the other tests of hypothesis we have studied. The sizes of the effects are simply indicative.

10.3 Test for Differences in Means: Assuming Equal Population Variances
In situations when we do not know the population variances but assume the variances are the same, the pooled sample
variance will be smaller than the individual sample variances.
This will give more precise estimates and reduce the probability of discarding a good null.

10.4 Comparing Two Independent Population Proportions
Test of two population proportions from independent samples.
• Random variable: p' A – p' B = difference between the two estimated proportions
• Distribution: normal distribution

10.5 Two Population Means with Known Standard Deviations
A hypothesis test of two population means from independent samples where the population standard deviations are known
(typically approximated with the sample standard deviations), will have these characteristics:

–

–

• Random variable: X 1 − X 2 = the difference of the means
• Distribution: normal distribution

10.6 Matched or Paired Samples
A hypothesis test for matched or paired samples (t-test) has these characteristics:
• Test the differences by subtracting one measurement from the other measurement
• Random Variable: –x d = mean of the differences

• Distribution: Student’s-t distribution with n – 1 degrees of freedom
• If the number of differences is small (less than 30), the differences must follow a normal distribution.

64. The mean number of English courses taken in a two–year time period by male and female college students is believed
to be about the same. An experiment is conducted and data are collected from 29 males and 16 females. The males took an
average of three English courses with a standard deviation of 0.8. The females took an average of four English courses with
a standard deviation of 1.0. Are the means statistically the same?
65. A student at a four-year college claims that mean enrollment at four–year colleges is higher than at two–year colleges
in the United States. Two surveys are conducted. Of the 35 two–year colleges surveyed, the mean enrollment was 5,068
with a standard deviation of 4,777. Of the 35 four-year colleges surveyed, the mean enrollment was 5,466 with a standard
deviation of 8,191.

are believed to be approximately the same. A recruiting office thinks that the mean mechanical engineering salary is
actually lower than the mean electrical engineering salary. The recruiting office randomly surveys 50 entry level mechanical
engineers and 60 entry level electrical engineers. Their mean salaries were $46,100 and $46,700, respectively. Their
standard deviations were $3,450 and $4,210, respectively. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if you agree that the mean
entry-level mechanical engineering salary is lower than the mean entry-level electrical engineering salary.

75. Suppose a statistics instructor believes that there is no significant difference between the mean class scores of statistics
day students on Exam 2 and statistics night students on Exam 2. She takes random samples from each of the populations.
The mean and standard deviation for 35 statistics day students were 75.86 and 16.91. The mean and standard deviation
for 37 statistics night students were 75.41 and 19.73. The “day” subscript refers to the statistics day students. The “night”
subscript refers to the statistics night students. A concluding statement is:

92. "To Breakfast or Not to Breakfast?" by Richard Ayore
In the American society, birthdays are one of those days that everyone looks forward to. People of different ages and peer
groups gather to mark the 18th, 20th, …, birthdays. During this time, one looks back to see what he or she has achieved for
the past year and also focuses ahead for more to come.
If, by any chance, I am invited to one of these parties, my experience is always different. Instead of dancing around with
my friends while the music is booming, I get carried away by memories of my family back home in Kenya. I remember the
good times I had with my brothers and sister while we did our daily routine.
Every morning, I remember we went to the shamba (garden) to weed our crops. I remember one day arguing with my
brother as to why he always remained behind just to join us an hour later. In his defense, he said that he preferred waiting
for breakfast before he came to weed. He said, “This is why I always work more hours than you guys!”
And so, to prove him wrong or right, we decided to give it a try. One day we went to work as usual without breakfast,
and recorded the time we could work before getting tired and stopping. On the next day, we all ate breakfast before going
to work. We recorded how long we worked again before getting tired and stopping. Of interest was our mean increase in
work time. Though not sure, my brother insisted that it was more than two hours. Using the data in Table 10.18, solve our
problem.

93. A study is done to determine if students in the California state university system take longer to graduate, on average,
than students enrolled in private universities. One hundred students from both the California state university system and
private universities are surveyed. Suppose that from years of research, it is known that the population standard deviations
are 1.5811 years and 1 year, respectively. The following data are collected. The California state university system students
took on average 4.5 years with a standard deviation of 0.8. The private university students took on average 4.1 years with a
standard deviation of 0.3.

94. Parents of teenage boys often complain that auto insurance costs more, on average, for teenage boys than for teenage
girls. A group of concerned parents examines a random sample of insurance bills. The mean annual cost for 36 teenage boys
was $679. For 23 teenage girls, it was $559. From past years, it is known that the population standard deviation for each
group is $180. Determine whether or not you believe that the mean cost for auto insurance for teenage boys is greater than
that for teenage girls.
95. A group of transfer bound students wondered if they will spend the same mean amount on texts and supplies each
year at their four-year university as they have at their community college. They conducted a random survey of 54 students
at their community college and 66 students at their local four-year university. The sample means were $947 and $1,011,
respectively. The population standard deviations are known to be $254 and $87, respectively. Conduct a hypothesis test to
determine if the means are statistically the same.
96. Some manufacturers claim that non-hybrid sedan cars have a lower mean miles-per-gallon (mpg) than hybrid ones.
Suppose that consumers test 21 hybrid sedans and get a mean of 31 mpg with a standard deviation of seven mpg. Thirtyone non-hybrid sedans get a mean of 22 mpg with a standard deviation of four mpg. Suppose that the population standard
deviations are known to be six and three, respectively. Conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate the manufacturers claim.
97. A baseball fan wanted to know if there is a difference between the number of games played in a World Series when
the American League won the series versus when the National League won the series. From 1922 to 2012, the population
standard deviation of games won by the American League was 1.14, and the population standard deviation of games won
by the National League was 1.11. Of 19 randomly selected World Series games won by the American League, the mean
number of games won was 5.76. The mean number of 17 randomly selected games won by the National League was 5.42.

difference in the husband’s versus the wife’s satisfaction level is negative (meaning that, within the partnership, the husband
is happier than the wife).

11 | THE CHI-SQUARE
DISTRIBUTION

Figure 11.1 The chi-square distribution can be used to find relationships between two things, like grocery prices at
different stores. (credit: Pete/flickr)

Introduction
Have you ever wondered if lottery winning numbers were evenly distributed or if some numbers occurred with a greater
frequency? How about if the types of movies people preferred were different across different age groups? What about if a
coffee machine was dispensing approximately the same amount of coffee each time? You could answer these questions by
conducting a hypothesis test.
You will now study a new distribution, one that is used to determine the answers to such questions. This distribution is
called the chi-square distribution.
In this chapter, you will learn the three major applications of the chi-square distribution:
1. the goodness-of-fit test, which determines if data fit a particular distribution, such as in the lottery example
2. the test of independence, which determines if events are independent, such as in the movie example
3. the test of a single variance, which tests variability, such as in the coffee example

466

Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution

11.1 | Facts About the Chi-Square Distribution
The notation for the chi-square distribution is:

χ ∼ χ d2 f
where df = degrees of freedom which depends on how chi-square is being used. (If you want to practice calculating chisquare probabilities then use df = n - 1. The degrees of freedom for the three major uses are each calculated differently.)
For the χ2 distribution, the population mean is μ = df and the population standard deviation is σ = 2(d f ) .
The random variable is shown as χ2.
The random variable for a chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom is the sum of k independent, squared standard
normal variables.
χ2 = (Z1)2 + (Z2)2 + ... + (Zk)2
1. The curve is nonsymmetrical and skewed to the right.
2. There is a different chi-square curve for each df.

Figure 11.2

3. The test statistic for any test is always greater than or equal to zero.
2
4. When df > 90, the chi-square curve approximates the normal distribution. For X ~ χ 1,000
the mean, μ = df = 1,000

and the standard deviation, σ = 2(1,000) = 44.7. Therefore, X ~ N(1,000, 44.7), approximately.
5. The mean, μ, is located just to the right of the peak.

11.2 | Test of a Single Variance
Thus far our interest has been exclusively on the population parameter μ or it's counterpart in the binomial, p. Surely the
mean of a population is the most critical piece of information to have, but in some cases we are interested in the variability
of the outcomes of some distribution. In almost all production processes quality is measured not only by how closely the
machine matches the target, but also the variability of the process. If one were filling bags with potato chips not only would
there be interest in the average weight of the bag, but also how much variation there was in the weights. No one wants to be
assured that the average weight is accurate when their bag has no chips. Electricity voltage may meet some average level,
but great variability, spikes, can cause serious damage to electrical machines, especially computers. I would not only like
to have a high mean grade in my classes, but also low variation about this mean. In short, statistical tests concerning the
variance of a distribution have great value and many applications.
A test of a single variance assumes that the underlying distribution is normal. The null and alternative hypotheses are
stated in terms of the population variance. The test statistic is:

χ c2 =

⎛
⎝n

- 1⎞⎠s 2
σ 02

where:
• n = the total number of observations in the sample data
• s2 = sample variance
•

σ 02 = hypothesized value of the population variance

•

H 0 : σ 2 = σ 02

•

H a : σ 2 ≠ σ 02

You may think of s as the random variable in this test. The number of degrees of freedom is df = n - 1. A test of a single
variance may be right-tailed, left-tailed, or two-tailed. Example 11.1 will show you how to set up the null and alternative
hypotheses. The null and alternative hypotheses contain statements about the population variance.

Example 11.1
Math instructors are not only interested in how their students do on exams, on average, but how the exam scores
vary. To many instructors, the variance (or standard deviation) may be more important than the average.
Suppose a math instructor believes that the standard deviation for his final exam is five points. One of his best
students thinks otherwise. The student claims that the standard deviation is more than five points. If the student
were to conduct a hypothesis test, what would the null and alternative hypotheses be?
Solution 11.1
Even though we are given the population standard deviation, we can set up the test using the population variance
as follows.
• H 0: σ 2 ≤ 5 2
• H a: σ 2 > 5 2

11.1 A SCUBA instructor wants to record the collective depths each of his students' dives during their checkout. He is
interested in how the depths vary, even though everyone should have been at the same depth. He believes the standard
deviation is three feet. His assistant thinks the standard deviation is less than three feet. If the instructor were to conduct
a test, what would the null and alternative hypotheses be?

Example 11.2
With individual lines at its various windows, a post office finds that the standard deviation for waiting times for
customers on Friday afternoon is 7.2 minutes. The post office experiments with a single, main waiting line and
finds that for a random sample of 25 customers, the waiting times for customers have a standard deviation of 3.5
minutes on a Friday afternoon.
With a significance level of 5%, test the claim that a single line causes lower variation among waiting times
for customers.
Solution 11.2
Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance. The parameter is the
population variance, σ2.

where n = 25, s = 3.5, and σ = 7.2.

Figure 11.3

The graph of the Chi-square shows the distribution and marks the critical value with 24 degrees of freedom at
95% level of confidence, α = 0.05, 13.85. The critical value of 13.85 came from the Chi squared table which is
read very much like the students t table. The difference is that the students t distribution is symmetrical and the
Chi squared distribution is not. At the top of the Chi squared table we see not only the familiar 0.05, 0.10, etc.
but also 0.95, 0.975, etc. These are the columns used to find the left hand critical value. The graph also marks
the calculated χ2 test statistic of 5.67. Comparing the test statistic with the critical value, as we have done with all
other hypothesis tests, we reach the conclusion.
Make a decision: Because the calculated test statistic is in the tail we cannot accept H0. This means that you
reject σ2 ≥ 7.22. In other words, you do not think the variation in waiting times is 7.2 minutes or more; you think
the variation in waiting times is less.
Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a single
line causes a lower variation among the waiting times or with a single line, the customer waiting times vary less
than 7.2 minutes.

Example 11.3
Professor Hadley has a weakness for cream filled donuts, but he believes that some bakeries are not properly
filling the donuts. A sample of 24 donuts reveals a mean amount of filling equal to 0.04 cups, and the sample
standard deviation is 0.11 cups. Professor Hadley has an interest in the average quantity of filling, of course,
but he is particularly distressed if one donut is radically different from another. Professor Hadley does not like
surprises.
Test at 95% the null hypothesis that the population variance of donut filling is significantly different from the
average amount of filling.
Solution 11.3
This is clearly a problem dealing with variances. In this case we are testing a single sample rather than comparing
two samples from different populations. The null and alternative hypotheses are thus:

H 0 : σ 2 = 0.04
H 0 : σ 2 ≠ 0.04

The test is set up as a two-tailed test because Professor Hadley has shown concern with too much variation in
filling as well as too little: his dislike of a surprise is any level of filling outside the expected average of 0.04 cups.
The test statistic is calculated to be:
2

χc =

⎛
⎝n

− 1⎞⎠s 2
σ o2

=

⎛
⎝24

− 1⎞⎠0.11 2
0.04 2

= 6.9575

The calculated χ 2 test statistic, 6.96, is in the tail therefore at a 0.05 level of significance, we cannot accept
the null hypothesis that the variance in the donut filling is equal to 0.04 cups. It seems that Professor Hadley is
destined to meet disappointment with each bit.

11.3 The FCC conducts broadband speed tests to measure how much data per second passes between a consumer’s
computer and the internet. As of August of 2012, the standard deviation of Internet speeds across Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) was 12.2 percent. Suppose a sample of 15 ISPs is taken, and the standard deviation is 13.2. An analyst
claims that the standard deviation of speeds is more than what was reported. State the null and alternative hypotheses,
compute the degrees of freedom, the test statistic, sketch the graph of the distribution and mark the area associated with
the level of confidence, and draw a conclusion. Test at the 1% significance level.

Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution

11.3 | Goodness-of-Fit Test
In this type of hypothesis test, you determine whether the data "fit" a particular distribution or not. For example, you may
suspect your unknown data fit a binomial distribution. You use a chi-square test (meaning the distribution for the hypothesis
test is chi-square) to determine if there is a fit or not. The null and the alternative hypotheses for this test may be written
in sentences or may be stated as equations or inequalities.
The test statistic for a goodness-of-fit test is:

(O − E) 2
E
k

Σ
where:
• O = observed values (data)
• E = expected values (from theory)
• k = the number of different data cells or categories

The observed values are the data values and the expected values are the values you would expect to get if the null
hypothesis were true. There are n terms of the form

(O − E) 2
.
E

The number of degrees of freedom is df = (number of categories – 1).
The goodness-of-fit test is almost always right-tailed. If the observed values and the corresponding expected values are
not close to each other, then the test statistic can get very large and will be way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve.

NOTE
The number of expected values inside each cell needs to be at least five in order to use this test.

Example 11.4
Absenteeism of college students from math classes is a major concern to math instructors because missing class
appears to increase the drop rate. Suppose that a study was done to determine if the actual student absenteeism
rate follows faculty perception. The faculty expected that a group of 100 students would miss class according to
Table 11.1.

Example 11.5
Employers want to know which days of the week employees are absent in a five-day work week. Most employers
would like to believe that employees are absent equally during the week. Suppose a random sample of 60
managers were asked on which day of the week they had the highest number of employee absences. The results
were distributed as in Table 11.6. For the population of employees, do the days for the highest number of
absences occur with equal frequencies during a five-day work week? Test at a 5% significance level.

Table 11.7 Day of the Week Employees were Most Absent

Solution 11.5
The null and alternative hypotheses are:
• H0: The absent days occur with equal frequencies, that is, they fit a uniform distribution.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11776/1.33

Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution

473

• Ha: The absent days occur with unequal frequencies, that is, they do not fit a uniform distribution.
If the absent days occur with equal frequencies, then, out of 60 absent days (the total in the sample: 15 + 12 + 9
+ 9 + 15 = 60), there would be 12 absences on Monday, 12 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, 12 on Thursday, and
12 on Friday. These numbers are the expected (E) values. The values in the table are the observed (O) values or
data.
This time, calculate the χ2 test statistic by hand. Make a chart with the following headings and fill in the columns:
• Expected (E) values (12, 12, 12, 12, 12)
• Observed (O) values (15, 12, 9, 9, 15)
• (O – E)
• (O – E)2
•

(O – E) 2
E

Now add (sum) the last column. The sum is three. This is the χ2 test statistic.
The calculated test statistics is 3 and the critical value of the χ2 distribution at 4 degrees of freedom the 0.05 level
of confidence is 9.48. This value is found in the χ2 table at the 0.05 column on the degrees of freedom row 4.
The degrees of freedom are the number of cells – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4
Next, complete a graph like the following one with the proper labeling and shading. (You should shade the right
tail.)

χ c2 = Σ

The decision is not to reject the null hypothesis because the calculated value of the test statistic is not in the tail
of the distribution.
Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that
the absent days do not occur with equal frequencies.

11.5 Teachers want to know which night each week their students are doing most of their homework. Most teachers

Solution 11.6
This problem asks you to test whether the far western United States families distribution fits the distribution of
the American families. This test is always right-tailed.
The first table contains expected percentages. To get expected (E) frequencies, multiply the percentage by 600.
The expected frequencies are shown in Table 11.10.

Therefore, the expected frequencies are 60, 96, 330, 66, and 48.
H0: The "number of televisions" distribution of far western United States families is the same as the "number of
televisions" distribution of the American population.
Ha: The "number of televisions" distribution of far western United States families is different from the "number
of televisions" distribution of the American population.
Distribution for the test: χ 42 where df = (the number of cells) – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4.
Calculate the test statistic: χ2 = 29.65
Graph:

The graph of the Chi-square shows the distribution and marks the critical value with four degrees of freedom at
99% level of confidence, α = .01, 13.277. The graph also marks the calculated chi squared test statistic of 29.65.
Comparing the test statistic with the critical value, as we have done with all other hypothesis tests, we reach the
conclusion.

476

Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution

Make a decision: Because the test statistic is in the tail of the distribution we cannot accept the null hypothesis.
This means you reject the belief that the distribution for the far western states is the same as that of the American
population as a whole.
Conclusion: At the 1% significance level, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the
"number of televisions" distribution for the far western United States is different from the "number of televisions"
distribution for the American population as a whole.

Example 11.7
Suppose you flip two coins 100 times. The results are 20 HH, 27 HT, 30 TH, and 23 TT. Are the coins fair? Test
at a 5% significance level.
Solution 11.7
This problem can be set up as a goodness-of-fit problem. The sample space for flipping two fair coins is {HH, HT,

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11776/1.33

Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution

477

TH, TT}. Out of 100 flips, you would expect 25 HH, 25 HT, 25 TH, and 25 TT. This is the expected distribution
from the binomial probability distribution. The question, "Are the coins fair?" is the same as saying, "Does the
distribution of the coins (20 HH, 27 HT, 30 TH, 23 TT) fit the expected distribution?"
Random Variable: Let X = the number of heads in one flip of the two coins. X takes on the values 0, 1, 2. (There
are 0, 1, or 2 heads in the flip of two coins.) Therefore, the number of cells is three. Since X = the number of
heads, the observed frequencies are 20 (for two heads), 57 (for one head), and 23 (for zero heads or both tails).
The expected frequencies are 25 (for two heads), 50 (for one head), and 25 (for zero heads or both tails). This test
is right-tailed.
H0: The coins are fair.
Ha: The coins are not fair.
Distribution for the test: χ 22 where df = 3 – 1 = 2.
Calculate the test statistic: χ2 = 2.14
Graph:

Figure 11.7

The graph of the Chi-square shows the distribution and marks the critical value with two degrees of freedom at
95% level of confidence, α = 0.05, 5.991. The graph also marks the calculated χ2 test statistic of 2.14. Comparing
the test statistic with the critical value, as we have done with all other hypothesis tests, we reach the conclusion.
Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the coins are not fair: we cannot reject the null
hypothesis that the coins are fair.

11.4 | Test of Independence
Tests of independence involve using a contingency table of observed (data) values.
The test statistic for a test of independence is similar to that of a goodness-of-fit test:

Σ

(i ⋅

where:
• O = observed values

(O – E) 2
E
j)

478

Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution

• E = expected values
• i = the number of rows in the table
• j = the number of columns in the table
There are i ⋅ j terms of the form

(O – E) 2
.
E

A test of independence determines whether two factors are independent or not. You first encountered the term
independence in Section 3.2 earlier. As a review, consider the following example.

NOTE
The expected value inside each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use this test.

Example 11.8
Suppose A = a speeding violation in the last year and B = a cell phone user while driving. If A and B are
independent then P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). A ∩ B is the event that a driver received a speeding violation last
year and also used a cell phone while driving. Suppose, in a study of drivers who received speeding violations
in the last year, and who used cell phone while driving, that 755 people were surveyed. Out of the 755, 70 had a
speeding violation and 685 did not; 305 used cell phones while driving and 450 did not.
Let y = expected number of drivers who used a cell phone while driving and received speeding violations.
If A and B are independent, then P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). By substitution,

y
⎞⎛
⎞
⎛
= 70 305
755 ⎝755 ⎠⎝755 ⎠

Solve for y: y =

(70)(305)
= 28.3
755

About 28 people from the sample are expected to use cell phones while driving and to receive speeding violations.
In a test of independence, we state the null and alternative hypotheses in words. Since the contingency table
consists of two factors, the null hypothesis states that the factors are independent and the alternative hypothesis
states that they are not independent (dependent). If we do a test of independence using the example, then the
null hypothesis is:

H 0 : Being a cell phone user while driving and receiving a speeding violation are independent events; in other
words, they have no effect on each other.
If the null hypothesis were true, we would expect about 28 people to use cell phones while driving and to receive
a speeding violation.
The test of independence is always right-tailed because of the calculation of the test statistic. If the expected
and observed values are not close together, then the test statistic is very large and way out in the right tail of the
chi-square curve, as it is in a goodness-of-fit.
The number of degrees of freedom for the test of independence is:
df = (number of columns - 1)(number of rows - 1)
The following formula calculates the expected number (E):

on the honor roll are independent events, what is the expected number of music students who are also on the honor
roll?

volunteered and type of volunteer. This test is always right-tailed.

Make a decision: Because the calculated test statistic is in the tail we cannot accept H0. This means that the

11.5 | Test for Homogeneity
The goodness–of–fit test can be used to decide whether a population fits a given distribution, but it will not suffice to decide
whether two populations follow the same unknown distribution. A different test, called the test for homogeneity, can be
used to draw a conclusion about whether two populations have the same distribution. To calculate the test statistic for a test
for homogeneity, follow the same procedure as with the test of independence.

NOTE
The expected value inside each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use this test.

Hypotheses
H0: The distributions of the two populations are the same.
Ha: The distributions of the two populations are not the same.
Test Statistic
Use a χ 2 test statistic. It is computed in the same way as the test for independence.
Degrees of Freedom (df)
df = number of columns - 1
Requirements
All values in the table must be greater than or equal to five.
Common Uses
Comparing two populations. For example: men vs. women, before vs. after, east vs. west. The variable is categorical with
more than two possible response values.

Do male and female college students have the same distribution of living arrangements? Use a level of
significance of 0.05. Suppose that 250 randomly selected male college students and 300 randomly selected
female college students were asked about their living arrangements: dormitory, apartment, with parents, other.

Ha: The distribution of living arrangements for male college students is not the same as the distribution of living
arrangements for female college students.
Degrees of Freedom (df):

at 95% level of confidence, α = 0.05, 7.815. The graph also marks the calculated χ2 test statistic of 10.129.
Comparing the test statistic with the critical value, as we have done with all other hypothesis tests, we reach the
conclusion.
Make a decision: Because the calculated test statistic is in the tail we cannot accept H0. This means that the
distributions are not the same.
Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the
distributions of living arrangements for male and female college students are not the same.
Notice that the conclusion is only that the distributions are not the same. We cannot use the test for homogeneity
to draw any conclusions about how they differ.

11.6 | Comparison of the Chi-Square Tests
Above the χ2 test statistic was used in three different circumstances. The following bulleted list is a summary of which χ2
test is the appropriate one to use in different circumstances.
• Goodness-of-Fit: Use the goodness-of-fit test to decide whether a population with an unknown distribution "fits" a
known distribution. In this case there will be a single qualitative survey question or a single outcome of an experiment
from a single population. Goodness-of-Fit is typically used to see if the population is uniform (all outcomes occur
with equal frequency), the population is normal, or the population is the same as another population with a known
distribution. The null and alternative hypotheses are:
H0: The population fits the given distribution.
Ha: The population does not fit the given distribution.
• Independence: Use the test for independence to decide whether two variables (factors) are independent or dependent.
In this case there will be two qualitative survey questions or experiments and a contingency table will be constructed.
The goal is to see if the two variables are unrelated (independent) or related (dependent). The null and alternative
hypotheses are:
H0: The two variables (factors) are independent.
Ha: The two variables (factors) are dependent.
• Homogeneity: Use the test for homogeneity to decide if two populations with unknown distributions have the same
distribution as each other. In this case there will be a single qualitative survey question or experiment given to two
different populations. The null and alternative hypotheses are:
H0: The two populations follow the same distribution.
Ha: The two populations have different distributions.

KEY TERMS
Contingency Table a table that displays sample values for two different factors that may be dependent or contingent
on one another; it facilitates determining conditional probabilities.
Goodness-of-Fit a hypothesis test that compares expected and observed values in order to look for significant
differences within one non-parametric variable. The degrees of freedom used equals the (number of categories – 1).
Test for Homogeneity a test used to draw a conclusion about whether two populations have the same distribution. The
degrees of freedom used equals the (number of columns – 1).
Test of Independence a hypothesis test that compares expected and observed values for contingency tables in order
to test for independence between two variables. The degrees of freedom used equals the (number of columns – 1)
multiplied by the (number of rows – 1).

CHAPTER REVIEW
11.1 Facts About the Chi-Square Distribution
The chi-square distribution is a useful tool for assessment in a series of problem categories. These problem categories
include primarily (i) whether a data set fits a particular distribution, (ii) whether the distributions of two populations are the
same, (iii) whether two events might be independent, and (iv) whether there is a different variability than expected within a
population.
An important parameter in a chi-square distribution is the degrees of freedom df in a given problem. The random variable
in the chi-square distribution is the sum of squares of df standard normal variables, which must be independent. The key
characteristics of the chi-square distribution also depend directly on the degrees of freedom.
The chi-square distribution curve is skewed to the right, and its shape depends on the degrees of freedom df. For df > 90,
the curve approximates the normal distribution. Test statistics based on the chi-square distribution are always greater than
or equal to zero. Such application tests are almost always right-tailed tests.

11.2 Test of a Single Variance
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses
are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).

11.3 Goodness-of-Fit Test
To assess whether a data set fits a specific distribution, you can apply the goodness-of-fit hypothesis test that uses the
chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the data come from the assumed distribution. The test
compares observed values against the values you would expect to have if your data followed the assumed distribution. The
test is almost always right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected value of at least five.

11.4 Test of Independence
To assess whether two factors are independent or not, you can apply the test of independence that uses the chi-square
distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the two factors are independent. The test compares observed values
to expected values. The test is right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected value of at least 5.

11.5 Test for Homogeneity
To assess whether two data sets are derived from the same distribution—which need not be known, you can apply the test
for homogeneity that uses the chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the populations of the two
data sets come from the same distribution. The test compares the observed values against the expected values if the two
populations followed the same distribution. The test is right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected
value of at least five.

11.6 Comparison of the Chi-Square Tests
The goodness-of-fit test is typically used to determine if data fits a particular distribution. The test of independence makes
use of a contingency table to determine the independence of two factors. The test for homogeneity determines whether two

with each order. The chef claims that the standard deviation for a ten-ounce order of fries is at most 1.5 oz., but the manager
thinks that it may be higher. He randomly weighs 49 orders of fries, which yields a mean of 11 oz. and a standard deviation
of two oz.
84. You want to buy a specific computer. A sales representative of the manufacturer claims that retail stores sell this
computer at an average price of $1,249 with a very narrow standard deviation of $25. You find a website that has a
price comparison for the same computer at a series of stores as follows: $1,299; $1,229.99; $1,193.08; $1,279; $1,224.95;
$1,229.99; $1,269.95; $1,249. Can you argue that pricing has a larger standard deviation than claimed by the manufacturer?
Use the 5% significance level. As a potential buyer, what would be the practical conclusion from your analysis?
85. A company packages apples by weight. One of the weight grades is Class A apples. Class A apples have a mean weight

513

12 | F DISTRIBUTION AND
ONE-WAY ANOVA

Figure 12.1 One-way ANOVA is used to measure information from several groups.

Introduction
Many statistical applications in psychology, social science, business administration, and the natural sciences involve several
groups. For example, an environmentalist is interested in knowing if the average amount of pollution varies in several
bodies of water. A sociologist is interested in knowing if the amount of income a person earns varies according to his or her
upbringing. A consumer looking for a new car might compare the average gas mileage of several models.
For hypothesis tests comparing averages among more than two groups, statisticians have developed a method called
"Analysis of Variance" (abbreviated ANOVA). In this chapter, you will study the simplest form of ANOVA called single
factor or one-way ANOVA. You will also study the F distribution, used for one-way ANOVA, and the test for differences
between two variances. This is just a very brief overview of one-way ANOVA. One-Way ANOVA, as it is presented here,
relies heavily on a calculator or computer.

12.1 | Test of Two Variances
This chapter introduces a new probability density function, the F distribution. This distribution is used for many applications

514

Chapter 12 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA

including ANOVA and for testing equality across multiple means. We begin with the F distribution and the test of hypothesis
of differences in variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college
administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for
a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be approximately the same. A supermarket might
be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers. In finance, the variance is a measure of risk and thus
an interesting question would be to test the hypothesis that two different investment portfolios have the same variance, the
volatility.
In order to perform a F test of two variances, it is important that the following are true:
1. The populations from which the two samples are drawn are approximately normally distributed.
2. The two populations are independent of each other.
Unlike most other hypothesis tests in this book, the F test for equality of two variances is very sensitive to deviations from
normality. If the two distributions are not normal, or close, the test can give a biased result for the test statistic.
Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let σ 12 and σ 22 be the unknown population
variances and s 21 and s 22 be the sample variances. Let the sample sizes be n1 and n2. Since we are interested in comparing
the two sample variances, we use the F ratio:
⎡s 2 ⎤
⎢ 1 ⎥
⎣σ 2 ⎦
F=⎡ 1 ⎤
s 2
⎢ 2 ⎥
⎣σ 2 2 ⎦

F has the distribution F ~ F(n1 – 1, n2 – 1)
where n1 – 1 are the degrees of freedom for the numerator and n2 – 1 are the degrees of freedom for the denominator.

⎡s 2 ⎤
⎢ 1 ⎥
⎣σ 2 ⎦
s 2
2
2
If the null hypothesis is σ 1 = σ 2 , then the F Ratio, test statistic, becomes F c = 1 = 1 2
⎡s 2 ⎤
s2
⎢ 2 ⎥
2
⎣σ 2 ⎦

The various forms of the hypotheses tested are:

Two-Tailed Test

One-Tailed Test

One-Tailed Test

H 0: σ 12 = σ 22

H 0: σ 12 ≤ σ 22

H 0: σ 12 ≥ σ 22

H 1: σ 12 ≠ σ 22

H 1: σ 12 > σ 22

H 1: σ 12 < σ 22

Table 12.1

A more general form of the null and alternative hypothesis for a two tailed test would be :

H0 :

σ12
= δ0
σ22

Ha :

σ12
≠ δ0
σ22

Where if δ0 = 1 it is a simple test of the hypothesis that the two variances are equal. This form of the hypothesis does have
the benefit of allowing for tests that are more than for simple differences and can accommodate tests for specific differences
as we did for differences in means and differences in proportions. This form of the hypothesis also shows the relationship
between the F distribution and the χ2 : the F is a ratio of two chi squared distributions a distribution we saw in the last
chapter. This is helpful in determining the degrees of freedom of the resultant F distribution.

s 2
If the two populations have equal variances, then s 21 and s 22 are close in value and the test statistic, F c = 1 2 is close to
s
2
2

one. But if the two population variances are very different, s 1 and s 2 tend to be very different, too. Choosing s 21 as the
s 2
s 2
larger sample variance causes the ratio 1 2 to be greater than one. If s 21 and s 22 are far apart, then F c = 1 2 is a large
s2
s2

number.
Therefore, if F is close to one, the evidence favors the null hypothesis (the two population variances are equal). But if F is
much larger than one, then the evidence is against the null hypothesis. In essence, we are asking if the calculated F statistic,
test statistic, is significantly different from one.
To determine the critical points we have to find Fα,df1,df2. See Appendix A for the F table. This F table has values for various
levels of significance from 0.1 to 0.001 designated as "p" in the first column. To find the critical value choose the desired
significance level and follow down and across to find the critical value at the intersection of the two different degrees of
freedom. The F distribution has two different degrees of freedom, one associated with the numerator, df1, and one associated
with the denominator, df2 and to complicate matters the F distribution is not symmetrical and changes the degree of skewness
as the degrees of freedom change. The degrees of freedom in the numerator is n1-1, where n1 is the sample size for group
1, and the degrees of freedom in the denominator is n2-1, where n2 is the sample size for group 2. Fα,df1,df2 will give the
critical value on the upper end of the F distribution.
To find the critical value for the lower end of the distribution, reverse the degrees of freedom and divide the F-value from
the table into one.
Upper tail critical value : Fα,df1,df2
Lower tail critical value : 1/Fα,df2,df1
When the calculated value of F is between the critical values, not in the tail, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
two variances came from a population with the same variance. If the calculated F-value is in either tail we cannot accept the
null hypothesis just as we have been doing for all of the previous tests of hypothesis.
An alternative way of finding the critical values of the F distribution makes the use of the F-table easier. We note in the
F-table that all the values of F are greater than one therefore the critical F value for the left hand tail will always be less
than one because to find the critical value on the left tail we divide an F value into the number one as shown above. We also
note that if the sample variance in the numerator of the test statistic is larger than the sample variance in the denominator,
the resulting F value will be greater than one. The shorthand method for this test is thus to be sure that the larger of the two
sample variances is placed in the numerator to calculate the test statistic. This will mean that only the right hand tail critical
value will have to be found in the F-table.

Example 12.1
Two college instructors are interested in whether or not there is any variation in the way they grade math exams.
They each grade the same set of 10 exams. The first instructor's grades have a variance of 52.3. The second
instructor's grades have a variance of 89.9. Test the claim that the first instructor's variance is smaller. (In most
colleges, it is desirable for the variances of exam grades to be nearly the same among instructors.) The level of
significance is 10%.
Solution 12.1
Let 1 and 2 be the subscripts that indicate the first and second instructor, respectively.
n1 = n2 = 10.
H0: σ 12 ≥ σ 22 and Ha: σ 12 < σ 22
Calculate the test statistic: By the null hypothesis (σ 12 ≥ σ 22 ) , the F statistic is:

Fc =

s 2 2 89.9
=
= 1.719
s 1 2 52.3

516

Chapter 12 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA

Critical value for the test: F9,9 = 5.35 where n1 – 1 = 9 and n2 – 1 = 9.

Figure 12.2

Make a decision: Since the calculated F value is not in the tail we cannot reject H0.
Conclusion: With a 10% level of significance, from the data, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the
variance in grades for the first instructor is smaller.

12.1 The New York Choral Society divides male singers up into four categories from highest voices to lowest: Tenor1,
Tenor2, Bass1, Bass2. In the table are heights of the men in the Tenor1 and Bass2 groups. One suspects that taller men
will have lower voices, and that the variance of height may go up with the lower voices as well. Do we have good
evidence that the variance of the heights of singers in each of these two groups (Tenor1 and Bass2) are different?

517

12.2 | One-Way ANOVA
The purpose of a one-way ANOVA test is to determine the existence of a statistically significant difference among several
group means. The test actually uses variances to help determine if the means are equal or not. In order to perform a oneway ANOVA test, there are five basic assumptions to be fulfilled:
1. Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal.
2. All samples are randomly selected and independent.
3. The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances).
4. The factor is a categorical variable.
5. The response is a numerical variable.

The Null and Alternative Hypotheses
The null hypothesis is simply that all the group population means are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that at least
one pair of means is different. For example, if there are k groups:

H 0 : µ 1 = µ 2 = µ 3 = . . .µ k
H a : At least two of the group means µ 1, µ 2, µ 3, . . . ,µ k are not equal. That is, µ i ≠ µ j for some i≠ j .
The graphs, a set of box plots representing the distribution of values with the group means indicated by a horizontal line
through the box, help in the understanding of the hypothesis test. In the first graph (red box plots), H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3
and the three populations have the same distribution if the null hypothesis is true. The variance of the combined data is
approximately the same as the variance of each of the populations.
If the null hypothesis is false, then the variance of the combined data is larger which is caused by the different means as
shown in the second graph (green box plots).

Figure 12.3 (a) H0 is true. All means are the same; the differences are due to random variation. (b) H0 is not true. All
means are not the same; the differences are too large to be due to random variation.

12.3 | The F Distribution and the F-Ratio
The distribution used for the hypothesis test is a new one. It is called the F distribution, invented by George Snedecor but
named in honor of Sir Ronald Fisher, an English statistician. The F statistic is a ratio (a fraction). There are two sets of
degrees of freedom; one for the numerator and one for the denominator.

518

Chapter 12 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA

For example, if F follows an F distribution and the number of degrees of freedom for the numerator is four, and the number
of degrees of freedom for the denominator is ten, then F ~ F4,10.
To calculate the F ratio, two estimates of the variance are made.
1. Variance between samples: An estimate of σ2 that is the variance of the sample means multiplied by n (when the
sample sizes are the same.). If the samples are different sizes, the variance between samples is weighted to account for
the different sample sizes. The variance is also called variation due to treatment or explained variation.
2. Variance within samples: An estimate of σ2 that is the average of the sample variances (also known as a pooled
variance). When the sample sizes are different, the variance within samples is weighted. The variance is also called
the variation due to error or unexplained variation.
• SSbetween = the sum of squares that represents the variation among the different samples
• SSwithin = the sum of squares that represents the variation within samples that is due to chance.
To find a "sum of squares" means to add together squared quantities that, in some cases, may be weighted. We used sum of
squares to calculate the sample variance and the sample standard deviation in Section 2..
MS means " mean square." MSbetween is the variance between groups, and MSwithin is the variance within groups.
Calculation of Sum of Squares and Mean Square
• k = the number of different groups
• nj = the size of the jth group
• sj = the sum of the values in the jth group
• n = total number of all the values combined (total sample size: ∑nj)
• x = one value: ∑x = ∑sj
• Sum of squares of all values from every group combined: ∑x2
• Between group variability: SStotal = ∑x2 –

The one-way ANOVA test depends on the fact that MSbetween can be influenced by population differences among means of
the several groups. Since MSwithin compares values of each group to its own group mean, the fact that group means might
be different does not affect MSwithin.

The null hypothesis says that all groups are samples from populations having the same normal distribution. The alternate
hypothesis says that at least two of the sample groups come from populations with different normal distributions. If the null
hypothesis is true, MSbetween and MSwithin should both estimate the same value.

NOTE
The null hypothesis says that all the group population means are equal. The hypothesis of equal means implies that
the populations have the same normal distribution, because it is assumed that the populations are normal and that they
have equal variances.

F-Ratio or F Statistic

F=

MS between
MS within

If MSbetween and MSwithin estimate the same value (following the belief that H0 is true), then the F-ratio should be
approximately equal to one. Mostly, just sampling errors would contribute to variations away from one. As it turns out,
MSbetween consists of the population variance plus a variance produced from the differences between the samples. MSwithin
is an estimate of the population variance. Since variances are always positive, if the null hypothesis is false, MSbetween will
generally be larger than MSwithin.Then the F-ratio will be larger than one. However, if the population effect is small, it is not
unlikely that MSwithin will be larger in a given sample.
The foregoing calculations were done with groups of different sizes. If the groups are the same size, the calculations simplify
somewhat and the F-ratio can be written as:
F-Ratio Formula when the groups are the same size

F=

n ⋅ s –x 2

• dfdenominator = n – k

12.2 As part of an experiment to see how different types of soil cover would affect slicing tomato production,
Marist College students grew tomato plants under different soil cover conditions. Groups of three plants each had one
of the following treatments
• bare soil
• a commercial ground cover
• black plastic
• straw
• compost
All plants grew under the same conditions and were the same variety. Students recorded the weight (in grams) of
tomatoes produced by each of the n = 15 plants:

Bare: n1 = 3

Ground Cover: n2 = 3

Plastic: n3 = 3

Straw: n4 = 3

Compost: n5 = 3

Create the one-way ANOVA table.

The one-way ANOVA hypothesis test is always right-tailed because larger F-values are way out in the right tail of the
F-distribution curve and tend to make us reject H0.

Example 12.3
Let’s return to the slicing tomato exercise in Try It. The means of the tomato yields under the five mulching
conditions are represented by μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4, μ5. We will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if all means
are the same or at least one is different. Using a significance level of 5%, test the null hypothesis that there is
no difference in mean yields among the five groups against the alternative hypothesis that at least one mean is
different from the rest.

Conclusion: At the 5% significance level, we have reasonably strong evidence that differences in mean yields for
slicing tomato plants grown under different mulching conditions are unlikely to be due to chance alone. We may
conclude that at least some of mulches led to different mean yields.

Using a significance level of 1%, is there a difference in mean grades among the sororities?
Solution 12.4
Let μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4 be the population means of the sororities. Remember that the null hypothesis claims that the
sorority groups are from the same normal distribution. The alternate hypothesis says that at least two of the
sorority groups come from populations with different normal distributions. Notice that the four sample sizes are
each five.

NOTE
This is an example of a balanced design, because each factor (i.e., sorority) has the same number of
observations.

Then MSbetween = ns –x 2 = (5)(0.413) where n = 5 is the sample size (number of plants each child grew).
Calculate the mean of the three sample variances (Calculate the mean of 11.7, 18.3, and 16.3). Mean of the

Then MSwithin = s2pooled = 15.433.

The dfs for the numerator = the number of groups – 1 = 3 – 1 = 2.
The dfs for the denominator = the total number of samples – the number of groups = 15 – 3 = 12
The distribution for the test is F2,12 and the F statistic is F = 0.134
The p-value is P(F > 0.134) = 0.8759.
Decision: Since α = 0.03 and the p-value = 0.8759, then you cannot reject H0. (Why?)
Conclusion: With a 3% level of significance, from the sample data, the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that
the mean heights of the bean plants are different.

Here are some facts about the F distribution.
1. The curve is not symmetrical but skewed to the right.
2. There is a different curve for each set of degrees of freedom.
3. The F statistic is greater than or equal to zero.
4. As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and for the denominator get larger, the curve approximates the normal as

can be seen in the two figures below. Figure (b) with more degrees of freedom is more closely approaching the normal
distribution, but remember that the F cannot ever be less than zero so the distribution does not have a tail that goes to
infinity on the left as the normal distribution does.
5. Other uses for the F distribution include comparing two variances and two-way Analysis of Variance. Two-Way

KEY TERMS
Analysis of Variance also referred to as ANOVA, is a method of testing whether or not the means of three or more
populations are equal. The method is applicable if:
• all populations of interest are normally distributed.
• the populations have equal standard deviations.
• samples (not necessarily of the same size) are randomly and independently selected from each population.
• there is one independent variable and one dependent variable.
The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F-ratio.
One-Way ANOVA a method of testing whether or not the means of three or more populations are equal; the method is
applicable if:
• all populations of interest are normally distributed.
• the populations have equal standard deviations.
• samples (not necessarily of the same size) are randomly and independently selected from each population.
The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F-ratio.
Variance mean of the squared deviations from the mean; the square of the standard deviation. For a set of data, a
deviation can be represented as x – –x where x is a value of the data and –x is the sample mean. The sample
variance is equal to the sum of the squares of the deviations divided by the difference of the sample size and one.

CHAPTER REVIEW
12.1 Test of Two Variances
The F test for the equality of two variances rests heavily on the assumption of normal distributions. The test is unreliable if
this assumption is not met. If both distributions are normal, then the ratio of the two sample variances is distributed as an F
statistic, with numerator and denominator degrees of freedom that are one less than the samples sizes of the corresponding
two groups. A test of two variances hypothesis test determines if two variances are the same. The distribution for the
hypothesis test is the F distribution with two different degrees of freedom.
Assumptions:
1. The populations from which the two samples are drawn are normally distributed.
2. The two populations are independent of each other.

12.2 One-Way ANOVA
Analysis of variance extends the comparison of two groups to several, each a level of a categorical variable (factor).
Samples from each group are independent, and must be randomly selected from normal populations with equal variances.
We test the null hypothesis of equal means of the response in every group versus the alternative hypothesis of one or more
group means being different from the others. A one-way ANOVA hypothesis test determines if several population means
are equal. The distribution for the test is the F distribution with two different degrees of freedom.
Assumptions:
1. Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal.
2. All samples are randomly selected and independent.
3. The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances).

12.3 The F Distribution and the F-Ratio
Analysis of variance compares the means of a response variable for several groups. ANOVA compares the variation within
each group to the variation of the mean of each group. The ratio of these two is the F statistic from an F distribution with
(number of groups – 1) as the numerator degrees of freedom and (number of observations – number of groups) as the

529

denominator degrees of freedom. These statistics are summarized in the ANOVA table.

12.4 Facts About the F Distribution
The graph of the F distribution is always positive and skewed right, though the shape can be mounded or exponential
depending on the combination of numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. The F statistic is the ratio of a measure
of the variation in the group means to a similar measure of the variation within the groups. If the null hypothesis is correct,
then the numerator should be small compared to the denominator. A small F statistic will result, and the area under the F
curve to the right will be large, representing a large p-value. When the null hypothesis of equal group means is incorrect,
then the numerator should be large compared to the denominator, giving a large F statistic and a small area (small p-value)
to the right of the statistic under the F curve.
When the data have unequal group sizes (unbalanced data), then techniques from Section 12.3 need to be used for hand
calculations. In the case of balanced data (the groups are the same size) however, simplified calculations based on group
means and variances may be used. In practice, of course, software is usually employed in the analysis. As in any analysis,
graphs of various sorts should be used in conjunction with numerical techniques. Always look at your data!

with each receiving one of three doses of caffeine: 0 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg. This is approximately the amount in no, one, or
two cups of coffee. Two hours after ingesting the caffeine, the men had the rate of finger tapping per minute recorded. The

63. The American League and the National League of Major League Baseball are each divided into three divisions: East,
Central, and West. Many years, fans talk about some divisions being stronger (having better teams) than other divisions.
This may have consequences for the postseason. For instance, in 2012 Tampa Bay won 90 games and did not play in the
postseason, while Detroit won only 88 and did play in the postseason. This may have been an oddity, but is there good
evidence that in the 2012 season, the American League divisions were significantly different in overall records? Use the
following data to test whether the mean number of wins per team in the three American League divisions were the same or
not. Note that the data are not balanced, as two divisions had five teams, while one had only four.

78. DDT is a pesticide that has been banned from use in the United States and most other areas of the world. It is quite
effective, but persisted in the environment and over time became seen as harmful to higher-level organisms. Famously, egg
shells of eagles and other raptors were believed to be thinner and prone to breakage in the nest because of ingestion of DDT
in the food chain of the birds.
An experiment was conducted on the number of eggs (fecundity) laid by female fruit flies. There are three groups of flies.
One group was bred to be resistant to DDT (the RS group). Another was bred to be especially susceptible to DDT (SS).

The values are the average number of eggs laid daily for each of 75 flies (25 in each group) over the first 14 days of their
lives. Using a 1% level of significance, are the mean rates of egg selection for the three strains of fruitfly different? If so,
in what way? Specifically, the researchers were interested in whether or not the selectively bred strains were different from
the nonselected line, and whether the two selected lines were different from each other.

Figure 12.12

Decision: Since the p-value is less than the level of significance of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis. Conclusion: We
have good evidence that the average number of eggs laid during the first 14 days of life for these three strains of fruitflies are
different. Interestingly, if you perform a two sample t-test to compare the RS and NS groups they are significantly different
(p = 0.0013). Similarly, SS and NS are significantly different (p = 0.0006). However, the two selected groups, RS and SS
are not significantly different (p = 0.5176). Thus we appear to have good evidence that selection either for resistance or
for susceptibility involves a reduced rate of egg production (for these specific strains) as compared to flies that were not
selected for resistance or susceptibility to DDT. Here, genetic selection has apparently involved a loss of fecundity.

AND CORRELATION

Introduction
Professionals often want to know how two or more numeric variables are related. For example, is there a relationship
between the grade on the second math exam a student takes and the grade on the final exam? If there is a relationship, what
is the relationship and how strong is it?
In another example, your income may be determined by your education, your profession, your years of experience, and your
ability, or your gender or color. The amount you pay a repair person for labor is often determined by an initial amount plus
an hourly fee.
These examples may or may not be tied to a model, meaning that some theory suggested that a relationship exists.
This link between a cause and an effect, often referred to as a model, is the foundation of the scientific method and is
the core of how we determine what we believe about how the world works. Beginning with a theory and developing
a model of the theoretical relationship should result in a prediction, what we have called a hypothesis earlier. Now the
hypothesis concerns a full set of relationships. As an example, in Economics the model of consumer choice is based upon
assumptions concerning human behavior: a desire to maximize something called utility, knowledge about the benefits of
one product over another, likes and dislikes, referred to generally as preferences, and so on. These combined to give us the
demand curve. From that we have the prediction that as prices rise the quantity demanded will fall. Economics has models
concerning the relationship between what prices are charged for goods and the market structure in which the firm operates,

552

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

monopoly verse competition, for example. Models for who would be most likely to be chosen for an on-the-job training
position, the impacts of Federal Reserve policy changes and the growth of the economy and on and on.
Models are not unique to Economics, even within the social sciences. In political science, for example, there are models that
predict behavior of bureaucrats to various changes in circumstances based upon assumptions of the goals of the bureaucrats.
There are models of political behavior dealing with strategic decision making both for international relations and domestic
politics.
The so-called hard sciences are, of course, the source of the scientific method as they tried through the centuries to explain
the confusing world around us. Some early models today make us laugh; spontaneous generation of life for example. These
early models are seen today as not much more than the foundational myths we developed to help us bring some sense of
order to what seemed chaos.
The foundation of all model building is the perhaps the arrogant statement that we know what caused the result we see. This
is embodied in the simple mathematical statement of the functional form that y = f(x). The response, Y, is caused by the
stimulus, X. Every model will eventually come to this final place and it will be here that the theory will live or die. Will the
data support this hypothesis? If so then fine, we shall believe this version of the world until a better theory comes to replace
it. This is the process by which we moved from flat earth to round earth, from earth-center solar system to sun-center solar
system, and on and on.
The scientific method does not confirm a theory for all time: it does not prove “truth”. All theories are subject to review
and may be overturned. These are lessons we learned as we first developed the concept of the hypothesis test earlier in this
book. Here, as we begin this section, these concepts deserve review because the tool we will develop here is the cornerstone
of the scientific method and the stakes are higher. Full theories will rise or fall because of this statistical tool; regression and
the more advanced versions call econometrics.
In this chapter we will begin with correlation, the investigation of relationships among variables that may or may not be
founded on a cause and effect model. The variables simply move in the same, or opposite, direction. That is to say, they
do not move randomly. Correlation provides a measure of the degree to which this is true. From there we develop a tool to
measure cause and effect relationships; regression analysis. We will be able to formulate models and tests to determine if
they are statistically sound. If they are found to be so, then we can use them to make predictions: if as a matter of policy
we changed the value of this variable what would happen to this other variable? If we imposed a gasoline tax of 50 cents
per gallon how would that effect the carbon emissions, sales of Hummers/Hybrids, use of mass transit, etc.? The ability to
provide answers to these types of questions is the value of regression as both a tool to help us understand our world and to
make thoughtful policy decisions.

13.1 | The Correlation Coefficient r
As we begin this section we note that the type of data we will be working with has changed. Perhaps unnoticed, all the data
we have been using is for a single variable. It may be from two samples, but it is still a univariate variable. The type of data
described in the examples above and for any model of cause and effect is bivariate data — "bi" for two variables. In reality,
statisticians use multivariate data, meaning many variables.
For our work we can classify data into three broad categories, time series data, cross-section data, and panel data. We met
the first two very early on. Time series data measures a single unit of observation; say a person, or a company or a country,
as time passes. What are measured will be at least two characteristics, say the person’s income, the quantity of a particular
good they buy and the price they paid. This would be three pieces of information in one time period, say 1985. If we
followed that person across time we would have those same pieces of information for 1985,1986, 1987, etc. This would
constitute a times series data set. If we did this for 10 years we would have 30 pieces of information concerning this person’s
consumption habits of this good for the past decade and we would know their income and the price they paid.
A second type of data set is for cross-section data. Here the variation is not across time for a single unit of observation, but
across units of observation during one point in time. For a particular period of time we would gather the price paid, amount
purchased, and income of many individual people.
A third type of data set is panel data. Here a panel of units of observation is followed across time. If we take our example
from above we might follow 500 people, the unit of observation, through time, ten years, and observe their income, price
paid and quantity of the good purchased. If we had 500 people and data for ten years for price, income and quantity
purchased we would have 15,000 pieces of information. These types of data sets are very expensive to construct and
maintain. They do, however, provide a tremendous amount of information that can be used to answer very important
questions. As an example, what is the effect on the labor force participation rate of women as their family of origin, mother
and father, age? Or are there differential effects on health outcomes depending upon the age at which a person started
smoking? Only panel data can give answers to these and related questions because we must follow multiple people across

553

time. The work we do here however will not be fully appropriate for data sets such as these.
Beginning with a set of data with two independent variables we ask the question: are these related? One way to visually
answer this question is to create a scatter plot of the data. We could not do that before when we were doing descriptive
statistics because those data were univariate. Now we have bivariate data so we can plot in two dimensions. Three
dimensions are possible on a flat piece of paper, but become very hard to fully conceptualize. Of course, more than three
dimensions cannot be graphed although the relationships can be measured mathematically.
To provide mathematical precision to the measurement of what we see we use the correlation coefficient. The correlation
tells us something about the co-movement of two variables, but nothing about why this movement occurred. Formally,
correlation analysis assumes that both variables being analyzed are independent variables. This means that neither one
causes the movement in the other. Further, it means that neither variable is dependent on the other, or for that matter, on any
other variable. Even with these limitations, correlation analysis can yield some interesting results.
The correlation coefficient, ρ (pronounced rho), is the mathematical statistic for a population that provides us with a
measurement of the strength of a linear relationship between the two variables. For a sample of data, the statistic, r,
developed by Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is an estimate of the population correlation and is defined mathematically as:

r=

1
n−1

Σ ⎛⎝X 1i − X 1⎞⎠⎛⎝X 2i − X 2⎞⎠
s x1 s x2

OR

– 2⎞
⎛

2
⎝ Σ X 1 i − n X 1 ⎠⎝ Σ X 2 i − n X 2 ⎠
–

–

where sx1 and sx2 are the standard deviations of the two independent variables X1 and X2, X 1 and X 2 are the sample
means of the two variables, and X1i and X2i are the individual observations of X1 and X2. The correlation coefficient r
ranges in value from -1 to 1. The second equivalent formula is often used because it may be computationally easier. As
scary as these formulas look they are really just the ratio of the covariance between the two variables and the product of
their two standard deviations. That is to say, it is a measure of relative variances.
In practice all correlation and regression analysis will be provided through computer software designed for these purposes.
Anything more than perhaps one-half a dozen observations creates immense computational problems. It was because of this
fact that correlation, and even more so, regression, were not widely used research tools until after the advent of “computing
machines”. Now the computing power required to analyze data using regression packages is deemed almost trivial by
comparison to just a decade ago.
To visualize any linear relationship that may exist review the plot of a scatter diagrams of the standardized data. Figure
13.2 presents several scatter diagrams and the calculated value of r. In panels (a) and (b) notice that the data generally
trend together, (a) upward and (b) downward. Panel (a) is an example of a positive correlation and panel (b) is an example
of a negative correlation, or relationship. The sign of the correlation coefficient tells us if the relationship is a positive or
negative (inverse) one. If all the values of X1 and X2 are on a straight line the correlation coefficient will be either 1 or
-1 depending on whether the line has a positive or negative slope and the closer to one or negative one the stronger the
relationship between the two variables. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT DOES
NOT TELL US THE SLOPE.

554

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

Figure 13.2

Remember, all the correlation coefficient tells us is whether or not the data are linearly related. In panel (d) the variables
obviously have some type of very specific relationship to each other, but the correlation coefficient is zero, indicating no
linear relationship exists.
If you suspect a linear relationship between X1 and X2 then r can measure how strong the linear relationship is.
What the VALUE of r tells us:
• The value of r is always between –1 and +1: –1 ≤ r ≤ 1.
• The size of the correlation r indicates the strength of the linear relationship between X1 and X2. Values of r close to
–1 or to +1 indicate a stronger linear relationship between X1 and X2.
• If r = 0 there is absolutely no linear relationship between X1 and X2 (no linear correlation).
• If r = 1, there is perfect positive correlation. If r = –1, there is perfect negative correlation. In both these cases, all of
the original data points lie on a straight line: ANY straight line no matter what the slope. Of course, in the real world,
this will not generally happen.
What the SIGN of r tells us
• A positive value of r means that when X1 increases, X2 tends to increase and when X1 decreases, X2 tends to decrease
(positive correlation).
• A negative value of r means that when X1 increases, X2 tends to decrease and when X1 decreases, X2 tends to increase
(negative correlation).

NOTE
Strong correlation does not suggest that X1 causes X2 or X2 causes X1. We say "correlation does not imply
causation."

13.2 | Testing the Significance of the Correlation
Coefficient
The correlation coefficient, r, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between X1 and X2.
The sample data are used to compute r, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the entire population, we
could find the population correlation coefficient. But because we have only sample data, we cannot calculate the population
correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient, r, is our estimate of the unknown population correlation
coefficient.
ρ = population correlation coefficient (unknown)
r = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data)
The hypothesis test lets us decide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ is "close to zero" or
"significantly different from zero". We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient r and the sample size n.
If the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the correlation
coefficient is "significant."
• Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between X1 and X2
because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.
• What the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship X1 and X2. If the test concludes that the
correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we say that correlation coefficient is
"not significant".

Performing the Hypothesis Test
• Null Hypothesis: H0: ρ = 0
• Alternate Hypothesis: Ha: ρ ≠ 0
What the Hypotheses Mean in Words
• Null Hypothesis H0: The population correlation coefficient IS NOT significantly different from zero. There IS NOT
a significant linear relationship (correlation) between X1 and X2 in the population.
• Alternate Hypothesis Ha: The population correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. There is a
significant linear relationship (correlation) between X1 and X2 in the population.
Drawing a Conclusion
There are two methods of making the decision concerning the hypothesis. The test statistic to test this hypothesis is:

tc =

r

⎛
2⎞
⎝1 − r ⎠

(n − 2)

OR
tc = r n − 2
1 − r2
Where the second formula is an equivalent form of the test statistic, n is the sample size and the degrees of freedom are n-2.
This is a t-statistic and operates in the same way as other t tests. Calculate the t-value and compare that with the critical value
from the t-table at the appropriate degrees of freedom and the level of confidence you wish to maintain. If the calculated
value is in the tail then cannot accept the null hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between these two independent
random variables. If the calculated t-value is NOT in the tailed then cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no linear
relationship between the two variables.
A quick shorthand way to test correlations is the relationship between the sample size and the correlation. If:

|r| ≥ 2
n
then this implies that the correlation between the two variables demonstrates that a linear relationship exists and is
statistically significant at approximately the 0.05 level of significance. As the formula indicates, there is an inverse
relationship between the sample size and the required correlation for significance of a linear relationship. With only 10
observations, the required correlation for significance is 0.6325, for 30 observations the required correlation for significance
decreases to 0.3651 and at 100 observations the required level is only 0.2000.

Correlations may be helpful in visualizing the data, but are not appropriately used to "explain" a relationship between two
variables. Perhaps no single statistic is more misused than the correlation coefficient. Citing correlations between health
conditions and everything from place of residence to eye color have the effect of implying a cause and effect relationship.
This simply cannot be accomplished with a correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient is, of course, innocent of this
misinterpretation. It is the duty of the analyst to use a statistic that is designed to test for cause and effect relationships and
report only those results if they are intending to make such a claim. The problem is that passing this more rigorous test is
difficult so lazy and/or unscrupulous "researchers" fall back on correlations when they cannot make their case legitimately.

13.3 | Linear Equations
Linear regression for two variables is based on a linear equation with one independent variable. The equation has the form:

y = a + bx
where a and b are constant numbers.
The variable x is the independent variable, and y is the dependent variable. Another way to think about this equation
is a statement of cause and effect. The X variable is the cause and the Y variable is the hypothesized effect. Typically, you
choose a value to substitute for the independent variable and then solve for the dependent variable.

Example 13.1
The following examples are linear equations.

y = 3 + 2x
y = –0.01 + 1.2x
The graph of a linear equation of the form y = a + bx is a straight line. Any line that is not vertical can be described by this
equation.

Example 13.2
Graph the equation y = –1 + 2x.

Example 13.3
Aaron's Word Processing Service (AWPS) does word processing. The rate for services is $32 per hour plus a
$31.50 one-time charge. The total cost to a customer depends on the number of hours it takes to complete the job.
Find the equation that expresses the total cost in terms of the number of hours required to complete the job.
Solution 13.3
Let x = the number of hours it takes to get the job done.
Let y = the total cost to the customer.
The $31.50 is a fixed cost. If it takes x hours to complete the job, then (32)(x) is the cost of the word processing
only. The total cost is: y = 31.50 + 32x

Slope and Y-Intercept of a Linear Equation
For the linear equation y = a + bx, b = slope and a = y-intercept. From algebra recall that the slope is a number that describes
the steepness of a line, and the y-intercept is the y coordinate of the point (0, a) where the line crosses the y-axis. From
calculus the slope is the first derivative of the function. For a linear function the slope is dy / dx = b where we can read the
mathematical expression as "the change in y (dy) that results from a change in x (dx) = b * dx".

is horizontal. (c) If b < 0, the line slopes downward to the right.

Example 13.4
Svetlana tutors to make extra money for college. For each tutoring session, she charges a one-time fee of $25
plus $15 per hour of tutoring. A linear equation that expresses the total amount of money Svetlana earns for each
session she tutors is y = 25 + 15x.
What are the independent and dependent variables? What is the y-intercept and what is the slope? Interpret them
using complete sentences.
Solution 13.4
The independent variable (x) is the number of hours Svetlana tutors each session. The dependent variable (y) is
the amount, in dollars, Svetlana earns for each session.
The y-intercept is 25 (a = 25). At the start of the tutoring session, Svetlana charges a one-time fee of $25 (this is
when x = 0). The slope is 15 (b = 15). For each session, Svetlana earns $15 for each hour she tutors.

13.4 | The Regression Equation
Regression analysis is a statistical technique that can test the hypothesis that a variable is dependent upon one or more other
variables. Further, regression analysis can provide an estimate of the magnitude of the impact of a change in one variable
on another. This last feature, of course, is all important in predicting future values.
Regression analysis is based upon a functional relationship among variables and further, assumes that the relationship is
linear. This linearity assumption is required because, for the most part, the theoretical statistical properties of non-linear
estimation are not well worked out yet by the mathematicians and econometricians. This presents us with some difficulties
in economic analysis because many of our theoretical models are nonlinear. The marginal cost curve, for example, is
decidedly nonlinear as is the total cost function, if we are to believe in the effect of specialization of labor and the Law of
Diminishing Marginal Product. There are techniques for overcoming some of these difficulties, exponential and logarithmic
transformation of the data for example, but at the outset we must recognize that standard ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression analysis will always use a linear function to estimate what might be a nonlinear relationship.
The general linear regression model can be stated by the equation:

y i = β 0 + β 1 X 1i + β 2 X 2i + ⋯ + β k X ki + ε i
where β0 is the intercept, βi's are the slope between Y and the appropriate Xi, and ε (pronounced epsilon), is the error
term that captures errors in measurement of Y and the effect on Y of any variables missing from the equation that would
contribute to explaining variations in Y. This equation is the theoretical population equation and therefore uses Greek
letters. The equation we will estimate will have the Roman equivalent symbols. This is parallel to how we kept track of the
population parameters and sample parameters before. The symbol for the population mean was µ and for the sample mean
–
X and for the population standard deviation was σ and for the sample standard deviation was s. The equation that will be
estimated with a sample of data for two independent variables will thus be:

y i = b 0 + b 1 x 1i + b 2 x 2i + e i
As with our earlier work with probability distributions, this model works only if certain assumptions hold. These are that
the Y is normally distributed, the errors are also normally distributed with a mean of zero and a constant standard deviation,
and that the error terms are independent of the size of X and independent of each other.

Assumptions of the Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model
Each of these assumptions needs a bit more explanation. If one of these assumptions fails to be true, then it will have an
effect on the quality of the estimates. Some of the failures of these assumptions can be fixed while others result in estimates
that quite simply provide no insight into the questions the model is trying to answer or worse, give biased estimates.
1. The independent variables, x i , are all measured without error, and are fixed numbers that are independent of the error
term. This assumption is saying in effect that Y is deterministic, the result of a fixed component “X” and a random
error component “ϵ.”
2. The error term is a random variable with a mean of zero and a constant variance. The meaning of this is that the

variances of the independent variables are independent of the value of the variable. Consider the relationship between
personal income and the quantity of a good purchased as an example of a case where the variance is dependent upon
the value of the independent variable, income. It is plausible that as income increases the variation around the amount
purchased will also increase simply because of the flexibility provided with higher levels of income. The assumption
is for constant variance with respect to the magnitude of the independent variable called homoscedasticity. If the
assumption fails, then it is called heteroscedasticity. Figure 13.6 shows the case of homoscedasticity where all three
distributions have the same variance around the predicted value of Y regardless of the magnitude of X.
3. While the independent variables are all fixed values they are from a probability distribution that is normally
distributed. This can be seen in Figure 13.6 by the shape of the distributions placed on the predicted line at the
expected value of the relevant value of Y.
4. The independent variables are independent of Y, but are also assumed to be independent of the other X variables. The
model is designed to estimate the effects of independent variables on some dependent variable in accordance with
a proposed theory. The case where some or more of the independent variables are correlated is not unusual. There
may be no cause and effect relationship among the independent variables, but nevertheless they move together. Take
the case of a simple supply curve where quantity supplied is theoretically related to the price of the product and the
prices of inputs. There may be multiple inputs that may over time move together from general inflationary pressure.
The input prices will therefore violate this assumption of regression analysis. This condition is called multicollinearity,
which will be taken up in detail later.
5. The error terms are uncorrelated with each other. This situation arises from an effect on one error term from another
error term. While not exclusively a time series problem, it is here that we most often see this case. An X variable in
time period one has an effect on the Y variable, but this effect then has an effect in the next time period. This effect
gives rise to a relationship among the error terms. This case is called autocorrelation, “self-correlated.” The error terms
are now not independent of each other, but rather have their own effect on subsequent error terms.
Figure 13.6 shows the case where the assumptions of the regression model are being satisfied. The estimated line is
^

y = a + bx. Three values of X are shown. A normal distribution is placed at each point where X equals the estimated
line and the associated error at each value of Y. Notice that the three distributions are normally distributed around the point
on the line, and further, the variation, variance, around the predicted value is constant indicating homoscedasticity from
assumption 2. Figure 13.6 does not show all the assumptions of the regression model, but it helps visualize these important
ones.

This is the general form that is most often called the multiple regression model. So-called "simple" regression analysis has
only one independent (right-hand) variable rather than many independent variables. Simple regression is just a special case
of multiple regression. There is some value in beginning with simple regression: it is easy to graph in two dimensions,
difficult to graph in three dimensions, and impossible to graph in more than three dimensions. Consequently, our graphs
will be for the simple regression case. Figure 13.7 presents the regression problem in the form of a scatter plot graph of
the data set where it is hypothesized that Y is dependent upon the single independent variable X.
A basic relationship from Macroeconomic Principles is the consumption function. This theoretical relationship states that as
a person's income rises, their consumption rises, but by a smaller amount than the rise in income. If Y is consumption and
X is income in the equation below Figure 13.7, the regression problem is, first, to establish that this relationship exists,
and second, to determine the impact of a change in income on a person's consumption. The parameter β1 was called the
Marginal Propensity to Consume in Macroeconomics Principles.
Each "dot" in Figure 13.7 represents the consumption and income of different individuals at some point in time. This
was called cross-section data earlier; observations on variables at one point in time across different people or other units
of measurement. This analysis is often done with time series data, which would be the consumption and income of one
individual or country at different points in time. For macroeconomic problems it is common to use times series aggregated
data for a whole country. For this particular theoretical concept these data are readily available in the annual report of the
President’s Council of Economic Advisors.
The regression problem comes down to determining which straight line would best represent the data in Figure 13.8.
Regression analysis is sometimes called "least squares" analysis because the method of determining which line best "fits"
the data is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals of a line put through the data.

Population Equation: C = β0 + β1 Income + ε
Estimated Equation: C = b0 + b1 Income + e

This figure shows the assumed relationship between consumption and income from macroeconomic theory. Here the data
are plotted as a scatter plot and an estimated straight line has been drawn. From this graph we can see an error term, e1.
Each data point also has an error term. Again, the error term is put into the equation to capture effects on consumption that
are not caused by income changes. Such other effects might be a person’s savings or wealth, or periods of unemployment.
We will see how by minimizing the sum of these errors we can get an estimate for the slope and intercept of this line.
Consider the graph below. The notation has returned to that for the more general model rather than the specific case of the
Macroeconomic consumption function in our example.

The ŷ is read "y hat" and is the estimated value of y. (In Figure 13.8 C represents the estimated value of consumption
because it is on the estimated line.) It is the value of y obtained using the regression line. ŷ is not generally equal to y from
the data.
The term y 0 - ŷ 0 = e 0 is called the "error" or residual. It is not an error in the sense of a mistake. The error term was put
into the estimating equation to capture missing variables and errors in measurement that may have occurred in the dependent
variables. The absolute value of a residual measures the vertical distance between the actual value of y and the estimated
value of y. In other words, it measures the vertical distance between the actual data point and the predicted point on the line
as can be seen on the graph at point X0.
If the observed data point lies above the line, the residual is positive, and the line underestimates the actual data value for y.
If the observed data point lies below the line, the residual is negative, and the line overestimates that actual data value for y.
In the graph, y 0 - ŷ 0 = e 0 is the residual for the point shown. Here the point lies above the line and the residual is positive.
For each data point the residuals, or errors, are calculated yi – ŷi = ei for i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n where n is the sample size. Each |e|
is a vertical distance.
The sum of the errors squared is the term obviously called Sum of Squared Errors (SSE).
Using calculus, you can determine the straight line that has the parameter values of b0 and b1 that minimizes the SSE. When
you make the SSE a minimum, you have determined the points that are on the line of best fit. It turns out that the line of
best fit has the equation:

ŷ = b0 + b1 x

where b 0 = y − b 1 x and b 1 =

The sample means of the x values and the y values are x and y , respectively. The best fit line always passes through the
–

point ( x , y ) called the points of means.

where sy = the standard deviation of the y values and sx = the standard deviation of the x values and r is the correlation
coefficient between x and y.
These equations are called the Normal Equations and come from another very important mathematical finding called the
Gauss-Markov Theorem without which we could not do regression analysis. The Gauss-Markov Theorem tells us that the
estimates we get from using the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression method will result in estimates that have some very
important properties. In the Gauss-Markov Theorem it was proved that a least squares line is BLUE, which is, Best, Linear,
Unbiased, Estimator. Best is the statistical property that an estimator is the one with the minimum variance. Linear refers
to the property of the type of line being estimated. An unbiased estimator is one whose estimating function has an expected
mean equal to the mean of the population. (You will remember that the expected value of µ –x was equal to the population
mean µ in accordance with the Central Limit Theorem. This is exactly the same concept here).
Both Gauss and Markov were giants in the field of mathematics, and Gauss in physics too, in the 18th century and early 19th
century. They barely overlapped chronologically and never in geography, but Markov’s work on this theorem was based
extensively on the earlier work of Carl Gauss. The extensive applied value of this theorem had to wait until the middle of
this last century.
Using the OLS method we can now find the estimate of the error variance which is the variance of the squared errors, e2.
This is sometimes called the standard error of the estimate. (Grammatically this is probably best said as the estimate of
the error’s variance) The formula for the estimate of the error variance is:

s 2e =

Σ (y i − ŷ i ) 2
Σ ei2
=
n−k
n−k

where ŷ is the predicted value of y and y is the observed value, and thus the term ⎛⎝y i − ŷ i⎞⎠ 2 is the squared errors that are to
be minimized to find the estimates of the regression line parameters. This is really just the variance of the error terms and
follows our regular variance formula. One important note is that here we are dividing by (n - k) , which is the degrees of
freedom. The degrees of freedom of a regression equation will be the number of observations, n, reduced by the number of
estimated parameters, which includes the intercept as a parameter.
The variance of the errors is fundamental in testing hypotheses for a regression. It tells us just how “tight” the dispersion is
about the line. As we will see shortly, the greater the dispersion about the line, meaning the larger the variance of the errors,
the less probable that the hypothesized independent variable will be found to have a significant effect on the dependent
variable. In short, the theory being tested will more likely fail if the variance of the error term is high. Upon reflection this
should not be a surprise. As we tested hypotheses about a mean we observed that large variances reduced the calculated test
statistic and thus it failed to reach the tail of the distribution. In those cases, the null hypotheses could not be rejected. If we
cannot reject the null hypothesis in a regression problem, we must conclude that the hypothesized independent variable has
no effect on the dependent variable.
A way to visualize this concept is to draw two scatter plots of x and y data along a predetermined line. The first will have
little variance of the errors, meaning that all the data points will move close to the line. Now do the same except the data
points will have a large estimate of the error variance, meaning that the data points are scattered widely along the line.
Clearly the confidence about a relationship between x and y is effected by this difference between the estimate of the error
variance.

Testing the Parameters of the Line
The whole goal of the regression analysis was to test the hypothesis that the dependent variable, Y, was in fact dependent
upon the values of the independent variables as asserted by some foundation theory, such as the consumption function
example. Looking at the estimated equation under Figure 13.8, we see that this amounts to determining the values of b0
and b1. Notice that again we are using the convention of Greek letters for the population parameters and Roman letters for
their estimates.
The regression analysis output provided by the computer software will produce an estimate of b0 and b1, and any other b's
for other independent variables that were included in the estimated equation. The issue is how good are these estimates?
In order to test a hypothesis concerning any estimate, we have found that we need to know the underlying sampling
distribution. It should come as no surprise at his stage in the course that the answer is going to be the normal distribution.
This can be seen by remembering the assumption that the error term in the population, ε, is normally distributed. If the error
term is normally distributed and the variance of the estimates of the equation parameters, b0 and b1, are determined by the
variance of the error term, it follows that the variances of the parameter estimates are also normally distributed. And indeed

564

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

this is just the case.
We can see this by the creation of the test statistic for the test of hypothesis for the slope parameter, β1 in our consumption
function equation. To test whether or not Y does indeed depend upon X, or in our example, that consumption depends upon
income, we need only test the hypothesis that β1 equals zero. This hypothesis would be stated formally as:

H0 : β1 = 0
Ha : β1 ≠ 0
If we cannot reject the null hypothesis, we must conclude that our theory has no validity. If we cannot reject the null
hypothesis that β1 = 0 then b1, the coefficient of Income, is zero and zero times anything is zero. Therefore the effect of
Income on Consumption is zero. There is no relationship as our theory had suggested.
Notice that we have set up the presumption, the null hypothesis, as "no relationship". This puts the burden of proof on the
alternative hypothesis. In other words, if we are to validate our claim of finding a relationship, we must do so with a level
of significance greater than 90, 95, or 99 percent. The status quo is ignorance, no relationship exists, and to be able to make
the claim that we have actually added to our body of knowledge we must do so with significant probability of being correct.
John Maynard Keynes got it right and thus was born Keynesian economics starting with this basic concept in 1936.
The test statistic for this test comes directly from our old friend the standardizing formula:

tc =

b1 − β1
Sb
1

where b1 is the estimated value of the slope of the regression line, β1 is the hypothesized value of beta, in this case zero, and
S b is the standard deviation of the estimate of b1. In this case we are asking how many standard deviations is the estimated
1

slope away from the hypothesized slope. This is exactly the same question we asked before with respect to a hypothesis
about a mean: how many standard deviations is the estimated mean, the sample mean, from the hypothesized mean?
The test statistic is written as a student's t distribution, but if the sample size is larger enough so that the degrees of freedom
are greater than 30 we may again use the normal distribution. To see why we can use the student's t or normal distribution
we have only to look at S b ,the formula for the standard deviation of the estimate of b1:
1

Sb =
1

⎛
⎝

S e2

–

x i − x⎞⎠ 2

or

Sb =
1

⎛
⎝n

S e2
− 1⎞⎠S 2x

Where Se is the estimate of the error variance and S2x is the variance of x values of the coefficient of the independent
variable being tested.
We see that Se, the estimate of the error variance, is part of the computation. Because the estimate of the error variance
is based on the assumption of normality of the error terms, we can conclude that the sampling distribution of the b's, the
coefficients of our hypothesized regression line, are also normally distributed.
One last note concerns the degrees of freedom of the test statistic, ν=n-k. Previously we subtracted 1 from the sample size to
determine the degrees of freedom in a student's t problem. Here we must subtract one degree of freedom for each parameter
estimated in the equation. For the example of the consumption function we lose 2 degrees of freedom, one for b 0 , the
intercept, and one for b1, the slope of the consumption function. The degrees of freedom would be n - k - 1, where k is the
number of independent variables and the extra one is lost because of the intercept. If we were estimating an equation with
three independent variables, we would lose 4 degrees of freedom: three for the independent variables, k, and one more for
the intercept.
The decision rule for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis follows exactly the same form as in all our previous test
of hypothesis. Namely, if the calculated value of t (or Z) falls into the tails of the distribution, where the tails are defined by
α ,the required significance level in the test, we cannot accept the null hypothesis. If on the other hand, the calculated value
of the test statistic is within the critical region, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
If we conclude that we cannot accept the null hypothesis, we are able to state with (1 - α) level of confidence that the slope
of the line is given by b1. This is an extremely important conclusion. Regression analysis not only allows us to test if a

cause and effect relationship exists, we can also determine the magnitude of that relationship, if one is found to exist. It is
this feature of regression analysis that makes it so valuable. If models can be developed that have statistical validity, we are
then able to simulate the effects of changes in variables that may be under our control with some degree of probability , of
course. For example, if advertising is demonstrated to effect sales, we can determine the effects of changing the advertising
budget and decide if the increased sales are worth the added expense.

Multicollinearity
Our discussion earlier indicated that like all statistical models, the OLS regression model has important assumptions
attached. Each assumption, if violated, has an effect on the ability of the model to provide useful and meaningful estimates.
The Gauss-Markov Theorem has assured us that the OLS estimates are unbiased and minimum variance, but this is true
only under the assumptions of the model. Here we will look at the effects on OLS estimates if the independent variables are
correlated. The other assumptions and the methods to mitigate the difficulties they pose if they are found to be violated are
examined in Econometrics courses. We take up multicollinearity because it is so often prevalent in Economic models and it
often leads to frustrating results.
The OLS model assumes that all the independent variables are independent of each other. This assumption is easy to test for
a particular sample of data with simple correlation coefficients. Correlation, like much in statistics, is a matter of degree: a
little is not good, and a lot is terrible.
The goal of the regression technique is to tease out the independent impacts of each of a set of independent variables on
some hypothesized dependent variable. If two 2 independent variables are interrelated, that is, correlated, then we cannot
isolate the effects on Y of one from the other. In an extreme case where x 1 is a linear combination of x 2 , correlation equal
to one, both variables move in identical ways with Y. In this case it is impossible to determine the variable that is the true
cause of the effect on Y. (If the two variables were actually perfectly correlated, then mathematically no regression results
could actually be calculated.)
The normal equations for the coefficients show the effects of multicollinearity on the coefficients.

b1 =

b2 =

s y⎛⎝r x 1 y - r x 1 x 2 r x 2 y⎞⎠
s x 1⎛⎝1 - r 2x 1 x 2⎞⎠

s y⎛⎝r x 2 y - r x 1 x 2 r x 1 y⎞⎠
-

s x 2⎛⎝1 - r 2x 1 x 2⎞⎠
-

-

b0 = y - b1 x 1 - b2 x 2
The correlation between x 1 and x 2 , r x2 x , appears in the denominator of both the estimating formula for b 1 and b 2
1 2
. If the assumption of independence holds, then this term is zero. This indicates that there is no effect of the correlation
on the coefficient. On the other hand, as the correlation between the two independent variables increases the denominator
decreases, and thus the estimate of the coefficient increases. The correlation has the same effect on both of the coefficients
of these two variables. In essence, each variable is “taking” part of the effect on Y that should be attributed to the collinear
variable. This results in biased estimates.
Multicollinearity has a further deleterious impact on the OLS estimates. The correlation between the two independent
variables also shows up in the formulas for the estimate of the variance for the coefficients.

Here again we see the correlation between x 1 and x 2 in the denominator of the estimates of the variance for the
coefficients for both variables. If the correlation is zero as assumed in the regression model, then the formula collapses
to the familiar ratio of the variance of the errors to the variance of the relevant independent variable. If however the two
independent variables are correlated, then the variance of the estimate of the coefficient increases. This results in a smaller
t-value for the test of hypothesis of the coefficient. In short, multicollinearity results in failing to reject the null hypothesis
that the X variable has no impact on Y when in fact X does have a statistically significant impact on Y. Said another way, the
large standard errors of the estimated coefficient created by multicollinearity suggest statistical insignificance even when

the hypothesized relationship is strong.

How Good is the Equation?
In the last section we concerned ourselves with testing the hypothesis that the dependent variable did indeed depend upon
the hypothesized independent variable or variables. It may be that we find an independent variable that has some effect on
the dependent variable, but it may not be the only one, and it may not even be the most important one. Remember that the
error term was placed in the model to capture the effects of any missing independent variables. It follows that the error term
may be used to give a measure of the "goodness of fit" of the equation taken as a whole in explaining the variation of the
dependent variable, Y.
The multiple correlation coefficient, also called the coefficient of multiple determination or the coefficient of
determination, is given by the formula:

R 2 = SSR
SST
where SSR is the regression sum of squares, the squared deviation of the predicted value of y from the mean value of y
–⎞
⎛
⎝ŷ − y ⎠ , and SST is the total sum of squares which is the total squared deviation of the dependent variable, y, from its
mean value, including the error term, SSE, the sum of squared errors. Figure 13.10 shows how the total deviation of the
dependent variable, y, is partitioned into these two pieces.

Figure 13.10

Figure 13.10 shows the estimated regression line and a single observation, x1. Regression analysis tries to explain the
variation of the data about the mean value of the dependent variable, y. The question is, why do the observations of y vary
–
from the average level of y? The value of y at observation x1 varies from the mean of y by the difference ( y i − y ). The
sum of these differences squared is SST, the sum of squares total. The actual value of y at x1 deviates from the estimated
value, ŷ, by the difference between the estimated value and the actual value, ( y i − ŷ ). We recall that this is the error term, e,
and the sum of these errors is SSE, sum of squared errors. The deviation of the predicted value of y, ŷ, from the mean value
–
of y is ( ŷ − y ) and is the SSR, sum of squares regression. It is called “regression” because it is the deviation explained
by the regression. (Sometimes the SSR is called SSM for sum of squares mean because it measures the deviation from the
mean value of the dependent variable, y, as shown on the graph.).

Because the SST = SSR + SSE we see that the multiple correlation coefficient is the percent of the variance, or deviation
in y from its mean value, that is explained by the equation when taken as a whole. R2 will vary between zero and 1, with
zero indicating that none of the variation in y was explained by the equation and a value of 1 indicating that 100% of the
variation in y was explained by the equation. For time series studies expect a high R2 and for cross-section data expect low
R 2.
While a high R2 is desirable, remember that it is the tests of the hypothesis concerning the existence of a relationship
between a set of independent variables and a particular dependent variable that was the motivating factor in using the
regression model. It is validating a cause and effect relationship developed by some theory that is the true reason that we
chose the regression analysis. Increasing the number of independent variables will have the effect of increasing R2. To
–
account for this effect the proper measure of the coefficient of determination is the R 2 , adjusted for degrees of freedom, to
keep down mindless addition of independent variables.
There is no statistical test for the R2 and thus little can be said about the model using R2 with our characteristic confidence
level. Two models that have the same size of SSE, that is sum of squared errors, may have very different R2 if the competing
models have different SST, total sum of squared deviations. The goodness of fit of the two models is the same; they both
have the same sum of squares unexplained, errors squared, but because of the larger total sum of squares on one of the
models the R2 differs. Again, the real value of regression as a tool is to examine hypotheses developed from a model that
predicts certain relationships among the variables. These are tests of hypotheses on the coefficients of the model and not a
game of maximizing R2.
Another way to test the general quality of the overall model is to test the coefficients as a group rather than independently.
Because this is multiple regression (more than one X), we use the F-test to determine if our coefficients collectively affect
Y. The hypothesis is:

Ho : β1 = β2 = … = βi = 0
H a : "at least one of the βi is not equal to 0"
If the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, then we conclude that none of the independent variables contribute to explaining
the variation in Y. Reviewing Figure 13.10 we see that SSR, the explained sum of squares, is a measure of just how much
of the variation in Y is explained by all the variables in the model. SSE, the sum of the errors squared, measures just how
much is unexplained. It follows that the ratio of these two can provide us with a statistical test of the model as a whole.
Remembering that the F distribution is a ratio of Chi squared distributions and that variances are distributed according to
Chi Squared, and the sum of squared errors and the sum of squares are both variances, we have the test statistic for this
hypothesis as:

Fc =

⎛ SSR ⎞
⎝ k ⎠

⎛ SSE ⎞
⎝n − k − 1 ⎠

where n is the number of observations and k is the number of independent variables. It can be shown that this is equivalent
to:
2
Fc = n − k − 1 * R 2
k
1−R

building from Figure 13.10 where R2 is the coefficient of determination which is also a measure of the “goodness” of the
model.
As with all our tests of hypothesis, we reach a conclusion by comparing the calculated F statistic with the critical value given
our desired level of confidence. If the calculated test statistic, an F statistic in this case, is in the tail of the distribution, then
we cannot accept the null hypothesis. By not being able to accept the null hypotheses we conclude that this specification of
this model has validity, because at least one of the estimated coefficients is significantly different from zero.
An alternative way to reach this conclusion is to use the p-value comparison rule. The p-value is the area in the tail, given
the calculated F statistic. In essence, the computer is finding the F value in the table for us. The computer regression output
for the calculated F statistic is typically found in the ANOVA table section labeled “significance F". How to read the output
of an Excel regression is presented below. This is the probability of NOT accepting a false null hypothesis. If this probability
is less than our pre-determined alpha error, then the conclusion is that we cannot accept the null hypothesis.

Dummy Variables
Thus far the analysis of the OLS regression technique assumed that the independent variables in the models tested were
continuous random variables. There are, however, no restrictions in the regression model against independent variables that

568

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

are binary. This opens the regression model for testing hypotheses concerning categorical variables such as gender, race,
region of the country, before a certain data, after a certain date and innumerable others. These categorical variables take on
only two values, 1 and 0, success or failure, from the binomial probability distribution. The form of the equation becomes:

ŷ = b0 + b2 x2 + b1 x1

Figure 13.11

where x 2 = 0, 1 . X2 is the dummy variable and X1 is some continuous random variable. The constant, b0, is the y-intercept,
the value where the line crosses the y-axis. When the value of X2 = 0, the estimated line crosses at b0. When the value of
X2 = 1 then the estimated line crosses at b0 + b2. In effect the dummy variable causes the estimated line to shift either up
or down by the size of the effect of the characteristic captured by the dummy variable. Note that this is a simple parallel
shift and does not affect the impact of the other independent variable; X1.This variable is a continuous random variable and
predicts different values of y at different values of X1 holding constant the condition of the dummy variable.
An example of the use of a dummy variable is the work estimating the impact of gender on salaries. There is a full body of
literature on this topic and dummy variables are used extensively. For this example the salaries of elementary and secondary
school teachers for a particular state is examined. Using a homogeneous job category, school teachers, and for a single state
reduces many of the variations that naturally effect salaries such as differential physical risk, cost of living in a particular
state, and other working conditions. The estimating equation in its simplest form specifies salary as a function of various
teacher characteristic that economic theory would suggest could affect salary. These would include education level as a
measure of potential productivity, age and/or experience to capture on-the-job training, again as a measure of productivity.
Because the data are for school teachers employed in a public school districts rather than workers in a for-profit company,
the school district’s average revenue per average daily student attendance is included as a measure of ability to pay. The
results of the regression analysis using data on 24,916 school teachers are presented below.

The coefficients for all the independent variables are significantly different from zero as indicated by the standard errors.
Dividing the standard errors of each coefficient results in a t-value greater than 1.96 which is the required level for 95%
significance. The binary variable, our dummy variable of interest in this analysis, is gender where male is given a value of
1 and female given a value of 0. The coefficient is significantly different from zero with a dramatic t-statistic of 47 standard
deviations. We thus cannot accept the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero. Therefore we conclude that there
is a premium paid male teachers of $632 after holding constant experience, education and the wealth of the school district
in which the teacher is employed. It is important to note that these data are from some time ago and the $632 represents a
six percent salary premium at that time. A graph of this example of dummy variables is presented below.

Figure 13.12

In two dimensions, salary is the dependent variable on the vertical axis and total years of experience was chosen for the
continuous independent variable on horizontal axis. Any of the other independent variables could have been chosen to
illustrate the effect of the dummy variable. The relationship between total years of experience has a slope of $52.32 per
year of experience and the estimated line has an intercept of $4,269 if the gender variable is equal to zero, for female. If
the gender variable is equal to 1, for male, the coefficient for the gender variable is added to the intercept and thus the
relationship between total years of experience and salary is shifted upward parallel as indicated on the graph. Also marked

570

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

on the graph are various points for reference. A female school teacher with 10 years of experience receives a salary of
$4,792 on the basis of her experience only, but this is still $109 less than a male teacher with zero years of experience.
A more complex interaction between a dummy variable and the dependent variable can also be estimated. It may be that
the dummy variable has more than a simple shift effect on the dependent variable, but also interacts with one or more of
the other continuous independent variables. While not tested in the example above, it could be hypothesized that the impact
of gender on salary was not a one-time shift, but impacted the value of additional years of experience on salary also. That
is, female school teacher’s salaries were discounted at the start, and further did not grow at the same rate from the effect
of experience as for male school teachers. This would show up as a different slope for the relationship between total years
of experience for males than for females. If this is so then females school teachers would not just start behind their male
colleagues (as measured by the shift in the estimated regression line), but would fall further and further behind as time and
experienced increased.
The graph below shows how this hypothesis can be tested with the use of dummy variables and an interaction variable.

Figure 13.13

The estimating equation shows how the slope of X1, the continuous random variable experience, contains two parts, b1 and
b3. This occurs because of the new variable X2 X1, called the interaction variable, was created to allow for an effect on the
slope of X1 from changes in X2, the binary dummy variable. Note that when the dummy variable, X2 = 0 the interaction
variable has a value of 0, but when X2 = 1 the interaction variable has a value of X1. The coefficient b3 is an estimate
of the difference in the coefficient of X1 when X2 = 1 compared to when X2 = 0. In the example of teacher’s salaries, if
there is a premium paid to male teachers that affects the rate of increase in salaries from experience, then the rate at which
male teachers’ salaries rises would be b1 + b3 and the rate at which female teachers’ salaries rise would be simply b1. This
hypothesis can be tested with the hypothesis:

H 0 : β 3 = 0| β 1 = 0, β 2 = 0
H a : β 3 ≠ 0| β 1 ≠ 0, β 2 ≠ 0
This is a t-test using the test statistic for the parameter β3. If we cannot accept the null hypothesis that β3=0 we conclude
there is a difference between the rate of increase for the group for whom the value of the binary variable is set to 1, males in
this example. This estimating equation can be combined with our earlier one that tested only a parallel shift in the estimated

difference in the slope of the function with respect to total years of experience.

13.5 | Interpretation of Regression Coefficients: Elasticity
and Logarithmic Transformation
As we have seen, the coefficient of an equation estimated using OLS regression analysis provides an estimate of the slope
of a straight line that is assumed be the relationship between the dependent variable and at least one independent variable.
From the calculus, the slope of the line is the first derivative and tells us the magnitude of the impact of a one unit change in
the X variable upon the value of the Y variable measured in the units of the Y variable. As we saw in the case of dummy
variables, this can show up as a parallel shift in the estimated line or even a change in the slope of the line through an
interactive variable. Here we wish to explore the concept of elasticity and how we can use a regression analysis to estimate
the various elasticities in which economists have an interest.
The concept of elasticity is borrowed from engineering and physics where it is used to measure a material’s responsiveness
to a force, typically a physical force such as a stretching/pulling force. It is from here that we get the term an “elastic”
band. In economics, the force in question is some market force such as a change in price or income. Elasticity is measured
as a percentage change/response in both engineering applications and in economics. The value of measuring in percentage
terms is that the units of measurement do not play a role in the value of the measurement and thus allows direct comparison
between elasticities. As an example, if the price of gasoline increased say 50 cents from an initial price of $3.00 and
generated a decline in monthly consumption for a consumer from 50 gallons to 48 gallons we calculate the elasticity to

572

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

be 0.25. The price elasticity is the percentage change in quantity resulting from some percentage change in price. A 16
percent increase in price has generated only a 4 percent decrease in demand: 16% price change → 4% quantity change or
.04/.16 = .25. This is called an inelastic demand meaning a small response to the price change. This comes about because
there are few if any real substitutes for gasoline; perhaps public transportation, a bicycle or walking. Technically, of course,
the percentage change in demand from a price increase is a decline in demand thus price elasticity is a negative number.
The common convention, however, is to talk about elasticity as the absolute value of the number. Some goods have many
substitutes: pears for apples for plums, for grapes, etc. etc. The elasticity for such goods is larger than one and are called
elastic in demand. Here a small percentage change in price will induce a large percentage change in quantity demanded.
The consumer will easily shift the demand to the close substitute.
While this discussion has been about price changes, any of the independent variables in a demand equation will have an
associated elasticity. Thus, there is an income elasticity that measures the sensitivity of demand to changes in income: not
much for the demand for food, but very sensitive for yachts. If the demand equation contains a term for substitute goods,
say candy bars in a demand equation for cookies, then the responsiveness of demand for cookies from changes in prices of
candy bars can be measured. This is called the cross-price elasticity of demand and to an extent can be thought of as brand
loyalty from a marketing view. How responsive is the demand for Coca-Cola to changes in the price of Pepsi?
Now imagine the demand for a product that is very expensive. Again, the measure of elasticity is in percentage terms thus
the elasticity can be directly compared to that for gasoline: an elasticity of 0.25 for gasoline conveys the same information
as an elasticity of 0.25 for $25,000 car. Both goods are considered by the consumer to have few substitutes and thus have
inelastic demand curves, elasticities less than one.
The mathematical formulae for various elasticities are:

Price elasticity:η p =

⎛
⎝

%∆Q⎞⎠
(%∆P)

Where η is the Greek small case letter eta used to designate elasticity. ∆ is read as “change”.

Income elasticity: η Y =

⎛
⎝

%∆Q⎞⎠
(%∆Y)

Where Y is used as the symbol for income.

Cross-Price elasticity:η p1 =

⎛
⎝
⎛
⎝

%∆Q 1⎞⎠
%∆P 2⎞⎠

Where P2 is the price of the substitute good.
Examining closer the price elasticity we can write the formula as:

ηp =

⎛ ⎞
%∆Q⎞⎠ dQ ⎛ P ⎞
= b⎝ P ⎠
=
Q
(%∆P) dP ⎝Q ⎠
⎛
⎝

Where b is the estimated coefficient for price in the OLS regression.
The first form of the equation demonstrates the principle that elasticities are measured in percentage terms. Of course, the
ordinary least squares coefficients provide an estimate of the impact of a unit change in the independent variable, X, on the
dependent variable measured in units of Y. These coefficients are not elasticities, however, and are shown in the second way
⎛dQ ⎞
of writing the formula for elasticity as ⎝ ⎠ , the derivative of the estimated demand function which is simply the slope of
dP
the regression line. Multiplying the slope times P provides an elasticity measured in percentage terms.

Q

Along a straight-line demand curve the percentage change, thus elasticity, changes continuously as the scale changes, while
the slope, the estimated regression coefficient, remains constant. Going back to the demand for gasoline. A change in price
from $3.00 to $3.50 was a 16 percent increase in price. If the beginning price were $5.00 then the same 50¢ increase would
be only a 10 percent increase generating a different elasticity. Every straight-line demand curve has a range of elasticities
starting at the top left, high prices, with large elasticity numbers, elastic demand, and decreasing as one goes down the
demand curve, inelastic demand.
In order to provide a meaningful estimate of the elasticity of demand the convention is to estimate the elasticity at the point
of means. Remember that all OLS regression lines will go through the point of means. At this point is the greatest weight
of the data used to estimate the coefficient. The formula to estimate an elasticity when an OLS demand curve has been
estimated becomes:

Where P and Q are the mean values of these data used to estimate b , the price coefficient.
The same method can be used to estimate the other elasticities for the demand function by using the appropriate mean values
of the other variables; income and price of substitute goods for example.

Logarithmic Transformation of the Data
Ordinary least squares estimates typically assume that the population relationship among the variables is linear thus of the
form presented in The Regression Equation. In this form the interpretation of the coefficients is as discussed above;
quite simply the coefficient provides an estimate of the impact of a one unit change in X on Y measured in units of Y. It
does not matter just where along the line one wishes to make the measurement because it is a straight line with a constant
slope thus constant estimated level of impact per unit change. It may be, however, that the analyst wishes to estimate not
the simple unit measured impact on the Y variable, but the magnitude of the percentage impact on Y of a one unit change
in the X variable. Such a case might be how a unit change in experience, say one year, effects not the absolute amount of
a worker’s wage, but the percentage impact on the worker’s wage. Alternatively, it may be that the question asked is the
unit measured impact on Y of a specific percentage increase in X. An example may be “by how many dollars will sales
increase if the firm spends X percent more on advertising?” The third possibility is the case of elasticity discussed above.
Here we are interested in the percentage impact on quantity demanded for a given percentage change in price, or income
or perhaps the price of a substitute good. All three of these cases can be estimated by transforming the data to logarithms
before running the regression. The resulting coefficients will then provide a percentage change measurement of the relevant
variable.
To summarize, there are four cases:
1. Unit ∆X → Unit ∆Y (Standard OLS case)
2. Unit ∆X → %∆Y
3. %∆X → Unit ∆Y
4. %∆X → %∆Y (elasticity case)
Case 1: The ordinary least squares case begins with the linear model developed above:

Y = a + bX
where the coefficient of the independent variable b = dY is the slope of a straight line and thus measures the impact of a

dX

unit change in X on Y measured in units of Y.
Case 2: The underlying estimated equation is:

log⎛⎝Y⎞⎠ = a + bX
The equation is estimated by converting the Y values to logarithms and using OLS techniques to estimate the coefficient of
the X variable, b. This is called a semi-log estimation. Again, differentiating both sides of the equation allows us to develop
the interpretation of the X coefficient b:

d⎛⎝log Y⎞⎠ = bdX
dY = bdX
Y

Multiply by 100 to covert to percentages and rearranging terms gives:

100b = %∆Y
Unit ∆X
100b is thus the percentage change in Y resulting from a unit change in X.
Case 3: In this case the question is “what is the unit change in Y resulting from a percentage change in X?” What is the
dollar loss in revenues of a five percent increase in price or what is the total dollar cost impact of a five percent increase in
labor costs? The estimated equation for this case would be:

Y = a + Blog⎛⎝X ⎞⎠

574

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

Here the calculus differential of the estimated equation is:

dY = bd⎛⎝logX ⎞⎠
dY = b dX
X
Divide by 100 to get percentage and rearranging terms gives:

b = dY = Unit ∆Y
100 100 dX
%∆X
X
Therefore,

b is the increase in Y measured in units from a one percent increase in X.
100

Case 4: This is the elasticity case where both the dependent and independent variables are converted to logs before the OLS
estimation. This is known as the log-log case or double log case, and provides us with direct estimates of the elasticities of
the independent variables. The estimated equation is:

logY = a + blogX
Differentiating we have:

d⎛⎝logY ⎞⎠ = bd⎛⎝logX ⎞⎠
d⎛⎝logX ⎞⎠ = b 1 dX
X
thus:

1 dY = b 1 dX
Y
X

OR

dY = b dX
Y
X

⎛ ⎞
OR b = dY ⎝ X ⎠
dX Y

and b = %∆Y our definition of elasticity. We conclude that we can directly estimate the elasticity of a variable through

%∆X

double log transformation of the data. The estimated coefficient is the elasticity. It is common to use double log
transformation of all variables in the estimation of demand functions to get estimates of all the various elasticities of the
demand curve.

13.6 | Predicting with a Regression Equation
One important value of an estimated regression equation is its ability to predict the effects on Y of a change in one or
more values of the independent variables. The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made without estimates of
the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the formation of most policy. Regression
models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.
The Gauss-Markov theorem assures us that the point estimate of the impact on the dependent variable derived by putting
in the equation the hypothetical values of the independent variables one wishes to simulate will result in an estimate of the
dependent variable which is minimum variance and unbiased. That is to say that from this equation comes the best unbiased
point estimate of y given the values of x.

ŷ = b 0 + b, X 1i + ⋯ + b k X ki
Remember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because points have
no “width” above which there is an area to measure. This was why we developed confidence intervals for the mean and
proportion earlier. The same concern arises here also. There are actually two different approaches to the issue of developing
estimates of changes in the independent variable, or variables, on the dependent variable. The first approach wishes to
measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the value of x: this specific value implies the expected
value. Here the question is: what is the mean impact on y that would result from multiple hypothetical experiments on y at
this specific value of x. Remember that there is a variance around the estimated parameter of x and thus each experiment
will result in a bit of a different estimate of the predicted value of y.
The second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment: you choose
x and multiply it times the coefficient and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this approach acts as if there were a
single experiment the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger than the variance associated with the expected
value approach.
The conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s) on the

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

575

dependent variable and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question being asked, but there
are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for the expected value of the mean of the
estimated y, is called a confidence interval as we have named this concept before. The second case, where we are asking
for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variable y of a single experiment using a value of x, is called the prediction
interval. The test statistics for these two interval measures within which the estimated value of y will fall are:

Where se is the standard deviation of the error term and sx is the standard deviation of the x variable.
The mathematical computations of these two test statistics are complex. Various computer regression software packages
provide programs within the regression functions to provide answers to inquires of estimated predicted values of y given
various values chosen for the x variable(s). It is important to know just which interval is being tested in the computer
package because the difference in the size of the standard deviations will change the size of the interval estimated. This is
shown in Figure 13.15.

Figure 13.15 Prediction and confidence intervals for regression equation; 95% confidence level.

Figure 13.15 shows visually the difference the standard deviation makes in the size of the estimated intervals. The
confidence interval, measuring the expected value of the dependent variable, is smaller than the prediction interval for the
same level of confidence. The expected value method assumes that the experiment is conducted multiple times rather than
just once as in the other method. The logic here is similar, although not identical, to that discussed when developing the
relationship between the sample size and the confidence interval using the Central Limit Theorem. There, as the number of
experiments increased, the distribution narrowed and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of
the mean.
It is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of data used to
estimate the equation regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that all regression equations go
through the point of means, that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of all independent variables in the equation.
As the value of x chosen to estimate the associated value of y is further from the point of means the width of the estimated
interval around the point estimate increases. Choosing values of x beyond the range of the data used to estimate the equation
possess even greater danger of creating estimates with little use; very large intervals, and risk of error. Figure 13.16 shows
this relationship.

576

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

Figure 13.16 Confidence interval for an individual value of x, Xp, at 95% level of confidence

Figure 13.16 demonstrates the concern for the quality of the estimated interval whether it is a prediction interval or a
–
confidence interval. As the value chosen to predict y, Xp in the graph, is further from the central weight of the data, X , we
see the interval expand in width even while holding constant the level of confidence. This shows that the precision of any
estimate will diminish as one tries to predict beyond the largest weight of the data and most certainly will degrade rapidly
for predictions beyond the range of the data. Unfortunately, this is just where most predictions are desired. They can be
made, but the width of the confidence interval may be so large as to render the prediction useless. Only actual calculation
and the particular application can determine this, however.

Example 13.6
Recall the third exam/final exam example .
We found the equation of the best-fit line for the final exam grade as a function of the grade on the third-exam.
We can now use the least-squares regression line for prediction. Assume the coefficient for X was determined to
be significantly different from zero.
Suppose you want to estimate, or predict, the mean final exam score of statistics students who received 73 on the
third exam. The exam scores (x-values) range from 65 to 75. Since 73 is between the x-values 65 and 75, we feel
comfortable to substitute x = 73 into the equation. Then:

^y = − 173.51 + 4.83(73) = 179.08
We predict that statistics students who earn a grade of 73 on the third exam will earn a grade of 179.08 on the
final exam, on average.

is possible to enter 90 into the equation for x and calculate a corresponding y value, the y value that you get will
have a confidence interval that may not be meaningful.)

Analysis
This section of this chapter is here in recognition that what we are now asking requires much more than a quick calculation
of a ratio or a square root. Indeed, the use of regression analysis was almost non- existent before the middle of the
last century and did not really become a widely used tool until perhaps the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. Even then the
computational ability of even the largest IBM machines is laughable by today’s standards. In the early days programs were
developed by the researchers and shared. There was no market for something called “software” and certainly nothing called
“apps”, an entrant into the market only a few years old.
With the advent of the personal computer and the explosion of a vital software market we have a number of regression
and statistical analysis packages to choose from. Each has their merits. We have chosen Microsoft Excel because of the
wide-spread availability both on college campuses and in the post-college market place. Stata is an alternative and has
features that will be important for more advanced econometrics study if you choose to follow this path. Even more advanced
packages exist, but typically require the analyst to do some significant amount of programing to conduct their analysis. The
goal of this section is to demonstrate how to use Excel to run a regression and then to do so with an example of a simple
version of a demand curve.
The first step to doing a regression using Excel is to load the program into your computer. If you have Excel you have the
Analysis ToolPak although you may not have it activated. The program calls upon a significant amount of space so is not
loaded automatically.
To activate the Analysis ToolPak follow these steps:
Click “File” > “Options” > “Add-ins” to bring up a menu of the add-in “ToolPaks”. Select “Analysis ToolPak” and click
“GO” next to “Manage: excel add-ins” near the bottom of the window. This will open a new window where you click
“Analysis ToolPak” (make sure there is a green check mark in the box) and then click “OK”. Now there should be an
Analysis tab under the data menu. These steps are presented in the following screen shots.

Click “Data” then “Data Analysis” and then click “Regression” and “OK”. Congratulations, you have made it to the
regression window. The window asks for your inputs. Clicking the box next to the Y and X ranges will allow you to use the
click and drag feature of Excel to select your input ranges. Excel has one odd quirk and that is the click and drop feature
requires that the independent variables, the X variables, are all together, meaning that they form a single matrix. If your data
are set up with the Y variable between two columns of X variables Excel will not allow you to use click and drag. As an
example, say Column A and Column C are independent variables and Column B is the Y variable, the dependent variable.

Excel will not allow you to click and drop the data ranges. The solution is to move the column with the Y variable to column
A and then you can click and drag. The same problem arises again if you want to run the regression with only some of the X
variables. You will need to set up the matrix so all the X variables you wish to regress are in a tightly formed matrix. These
steps are presented in the following scene shots.

Once you have selected the data for your regression analysis and told Excel which one is the dependent variable (Y) and
which ones are the independent valuables (X‘s), you have several choices as to the parameters and how the output will be

displayed. Refer to screen shot Figure 13.22 under “Input” section. If you check the “labels” box the program will place
the entry in the first column of each variable as its name in the output. You can enter an actual name, such as price or income
in a demand analysis, in row one of the Excel spreadsheet for each variable and it will be displayed in the output.
The level of significance can also be set by the analyst. This will not change the calculated t statistic, called t stat, but will
alter the p value for the calculated t statistic. It will also alter the boundaries of the confidence intervals for the coefficients.
A 95 percent confidence interval is always presented, but with a change in this you will also get other levels of confidence
for the intervals.
Excel also will allow you to suppress the intercept. This forces the regression program to minimize the residual sum of
squares under the condition that the estimated line must go through the origin. This is done in cases where there is no
meaning in the model at some value other than zero, zero for the start of the line. An example is an economic production
function that is a relationship between the number of units of an input, say hours of labor, and output. There is no meaning
of positive output with zero workers.
Once the data are entered and the choices are made click OK and the results will be sent to a separate new worksheet
by default. The output from Excel is presented in a way typical of other regression package programs. The first block of
information gives the overall statistics of the regression: Multiple R, R Squared, and the R squared adjusted for degrees
of freedom, which is the one you want to report. You also get the Standard error (of the estimate) and the number of
observations in the regression.
The second block of information is titled ANOVA which stands for Analysis of Variance. Our interest in this section is the
column marked F. This is the calculated F statistics for the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients are equal to zero verse
the alternative that at least one of the coefficients are not equal to zero. This hypothesis test was presented in 13.4 under
“How Good is the Equation?” The next column gives the p value for this test under the title “Significance F”. If the p value
is less than say 0.05 (the calculated F statistic is in the tail) we can say with 90 % confidence that we cannot accept the null
hypotheses that all the coefficients are equal to zero. This is a good thing: it means that at least one of the coefficients is
significantly different from zero thus do have an effect on the value of Y.
The last block of information contains the hypothesis tests for the individual coefficient. The estimated coefficients, the
intercept and the slopes, are first listed and then each standard error (of the estimated coefficient) followed by the t stat
(calculated student’s t statistic for the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero). We compare the t stat and the
critical value of the student’s t, dependent on the degrees of freedom, and determine if we have enough evidence to reject the
null that the variable has no effect on Y. Remember that we have set up the null hypothesis as the status quo and our claim
that we know what caused the Y to change is in the alternative hypothesis. We want to reject the status quo and substitute
our version of the world, the alternative hypothesis. The next column contains the p values for this hypothesis test followed
by the estimated upper and lower bound of the confidence interval of the estimated slope parameter for various levels of
confidence set by us at the beginning.

Estimating the Demand for Roses
Here is an example of using the Excel program to run a regression for a particular specific case: estimating the demand for
roses. We are trying to estimate a demand curve, which from economic theory we expect certain variables affect how much
of a good we buy. The relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded is the demand curve. Beyond
that we have the demand function that includes other relevant variables: a person’s income, the price of substitute goods,
and perhaps other variables such as season of the year or the price of complimentary goods. Quantity demanded will be our
Y variable, and Price of roses, Price of carnations and Income will be our independent variables, the X variables.
For all of these variables theory tells us the expected relationship. For the price of the good in question, roses, theory predicts
an inverse relationship, the negatively sloped demand curve. Theory also predicts the relationship between the quantity
demanded of one good, here roses, and the price of a substitute, carnations in this example. Theory predicts that this should
be a positive or direct relationship; as the price of the substitute falls we substitute away from roses to the cheaper substitute,
carnations. A reduction in the price of the substitute generates a reduction in demand for the good being analyzed, roses
here. Reduction generates reduction is a positive relationship. For normal goods, theory also predicts a positive relationship;
as our incomes rise we buy more of the good, roses. We expect these results because that is what is predicted by a hundred
years of economic theory and research. Essentially we are testing these century-old hypotheses. The data gathered was
determined by the model that is being tested. This should always be the case. One is not doing inferential statistics by
throwing a mountain of data into a computer and asking the machine for a theory. Theory first, test follows.
These data here are national average prices and income is the nation’s per capita personal income. Quantity demanded is
total national annual sales of roses. These are annual time series data; we are tracking the rose market for the United States
from 1984-2017, 33 observations.
Because of the quirky way Excel requires how the data are entered into the regression package it is best to have the

independent variables, price of roses, price of carnations and income next to each other on the spreadsheet. Once your
data are entered into the spreadsheet it is always good to look at the data. Examine the range, the means and the standard
deviations. Use your understanding of descriptive statistics from the very first part of this course. In large data sets you will
not be able to “scan” the data. The Analysis ToolPac makes it easy to get the range, mean, standard deviations and other
parameters of the distributions. You can also quickly get the correlations among the variables. Examine for outliers. Review
the history. Did something happen? Was here a labor strike, change in import fees, something that makes these observations
unusual? Do not take the data without question. There may have been a typo somewhere, who knows without review.
Go to the regression window, enter the data and select 95% confidence level and click “OK”. You can include the labels in
the input range if you have put a title at the top of each column, but be sure to click the “labels” box on the main regression
page if you do.
The regression output should show up automatically on a new worksheet.

Figure 13.23

The first results presented is the R-Square, a measure of the strength of the correlation between Y and X1, X2, and X3 taken
as a group. Our R-square here of 0.699, adjusted for degrees of freedom, means that 70% of the variation in Y, demand
for roses, can be explained by variations in X1, X2, and X3, Price of roses, Price of carnations and Income. There is no
statistical test to determine the “significance” of an R2. Of course a higher R2 is preferred, but it is really the significance of
the coefficients that will determine the value of the theory being tested and which will become part of any policy discussion
if they are demonstrated to be significantly different form zero.
Looking at the third panel of output we can write the equation as:

Y = b0 + b1 X1 + b2 X2 + b3 X3 + e
where b0 is the intercept, b1 is the estimated coefficient on price of roses, and b2 is the estimated coefficient on price of
carnations, b3 is the estimated effect of income and e is the error term. The equation is written in Roman letters indicating
that these are the estimated values and not the population parameters, β’s.
Our estimated equation is:

Quantity of roses sold = 183,475 − 1.76 Price of roses + 1.33 Price of carnations + 3.03 Income
We first observe that the signs of the coefficients are as expected from theory. The demand curve is downward sloping with
the negative sign for the price of roses. Further the signs of both the price of carnations and income coefficients are positive
as would be expected from economic theory.
Interpreting the coefficients can tell us the magnitude of the impact of a change in each variable on the demand for roses.
It is the ability to do this which makes regression analysis such a valuable tool. The estimated coefficients tell us that an
increase the price of roses by one dollar will lead to a 1.76 reduction in the number roses purchased. The price of carnations
seems to play an important role in the demand for roses as we see that increasing the price of carnations by one dollar would

584

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

increase the demand for roses by 1.33 units as consumers would substitute away from the now more expensive carnations.
Similarly, increasing per capita income by one dollar will lead to a 3.03 unit increase in roses purchased.
These results are in line with the predictions of economics theory with respect to all three variables included in this estimate
of the demand for roses. It is important to have a theory first that predicts the significance or at least the direction of the
coefficients. Without a theory to test, this research tool is not much more helpful than the correlation coefficients we learned
about earlier.
We cannot stop there, however. We need to first check whether our coefficients are statistically significant from zero. We
set up a hypothesis of:

H0 : β1 = 0
Ha : β1 ≠ 0

for all three coefficients in the regression. Recall from earlier that we will not be able to definitively say that our estimated
b1 is the actual real population of β1, but rather only that with (1-α)% level of confidence that we cannot reject the null
hypothesis that our estimated β1 is significantly different from zero. The analyst is making a claim that the price of roses
causes an impact on quantity demanded. Indeed, that each of the included variables has an impact on the quantity of roses
demanded. The claim is therefore in the alternative hypotheses. It will take a very large probability, 0.95 in this case, to
overthrow the null hypothesis, the status quo, that β = 0. In all regression hypothesis tests the claim is in the alternative and
the claim is that the theory has found a variable that has a significant impact on the Y variable.
The test statistic for this hypothesis follows the familiar standardizing formula which counts the number of standard
deviations, t, that the estimated value of the parameter, b1, is away from the hypothesized value, β0, which is zero in this
case:

tc =

b1 − β0
Sb
1

The computer calculates this test statistic and presents it as “t stat”. You can find this value to the right of the standard
error of the coefficient estimate. The standard error of the coefficient for b1 is Sb1 in the formula. To reach a conclusion we
compare this test statistic with the critical value of the student’s t at degrees of freedom n-3-1 =29, and alpha = 0.025 (5%
significance level for a two-tailed test). Our t stat for b1 is approximately 5.90 which is greater than 1.96 (the critical value
we looked up in the t-table), so we cannot accept our null hypotheses of no effect. We conclude that Price has a significant
effect because the calculated t value is in the tail. We conduct the same test for b2 and b3. For each variable, we find that
we cannot accept the null hypothesis of no relationship because the calculated t-statistics are in the tail for each case, that
is, greater than the critical value. All variables in this regression have been determined to have a significant effect on the
demand for roses.
These tests tell us whether or not an individual coefficient is significantly different from zero, but does not address the
overall quality of the model. We have seen that the R squared adjusted for degrees of freedom indicates this model with
these three variables explains 70% of the variation in quantity of roses demanded. We can also conduct a second test of the
model taken as a whole. This is the F test presented in section 13.4 of this chapter. Because this is a multiple regression
(more than one X), we use the F-test to determine if our coefficients collectively affect Y. The hypothesis is:

H 0 : β 1 = β 2 = ... = βi = 0

H a : "at least one of the β i is not equal to 0"
Under the ANOVA section of the output we find the calculated F statistic for this hypotheses. For this example the F statistic
is 21.9. Again, comparing the calculated F statistic with the critical value given our desired level of significance and the
degrees of freedom will allow us to reach a conclusion.
The best way to reach a conclusion for this statistical test is to use the p-value comparison rule. The p-value is the area in
the tail, given the calculated F statistic. In essence the computer is finding the F value in the table for us and calculating the
p-value. In the Summary Output under “significance F” is this probability. For this example, it is calculated to be 2.6 x 10-5,
or 2.6 then moving the decimal five places to the left. (.000026) This is an almost infinitesimal level of probability and is
certainly less than our alpha level of .05 for a 5 percent level of significance.
By not being able to accept the null hypotheses we conclude that this specification of this model has validity because at
least one of the estimated coefficients is significantly different from zero. Since F-calculated is greater than F-critical, we
cannot accept H0, meaning that X1, X2 and X3 together has a significant effect on Y.
The development of computing machinery and the software useful for academic and business research has made it possible
to answer questions that just a few years ago we could not even formulate. Data is available in electronic format and can

sets that can today be used for research and analysis gives us a higher quality of results than in days past. Even with only

KEY TERMS
a is the symbol for the Y-Intercept Sometimes written as b 0 , because when writing the theoretical linear model

β 0 is used to represent a coefficient for a population.

b is the symbol for Slope The word coefficient will be used regularly for the slope, because it is a number that will
always be next to the letter “x.” It will be written as b 1 when a sample is used, and β 1 will be used with a
population or when writing the theoretical linear model.
Bivariate two variables are present in the model where one is the “cause” or independent variable and the other is the
“effect” of dependent variable.
Linear a model that takes data and regresses it into a straight line equation.
Multivariate a system or model where more than one independent variable is being used to predict an outcome. There
can only ever be one dependent variable, but there is no limit to the number of independent variables.

R2 – Coefficient of Determination This is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the percentage variation of the
dependent variable that can be explained by the variation in the independent

variable. Sometimes calculated by the equation R 2 = SSR where SSR is the “Sum of Squares Regression” and

SST

SST is the “Sum of Squares Total.” The appropriate coefficient of determination to be reported should always be
adjusted for degrees of freedom first.

R – Correlation Coefficient A number between −1 and 1 that represents the strength and direction of the
relationship between “X” and “Y.” The value for “r” will equal 1 or −1 only if all the
plotted points form a perfectly straight line.

Residual or “error” the value calculated from subtracting y − y^ = e . The absolute value of a residual measures
0
0
0
the vertical distance between the actual value of y and the estimated value of y that appears on the best-fit line.
Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) the calculated value from adding up all the squared residual terms. The hope is that
this value is very small when creating a model.
X – the independent variable This will sometimes be referred to as the “predictor” variable, because these values
were measured in order to determine what possible outcomes could be predicted.
Y – the dependent variable Also, using the letter “y” represents actual values while y^ represents predicted or
estimated values. Predicted values will come from plugging in observed “x” values into a linear model.

CHAPTER REVIEW
13.3 Linear Equations
The most basic type of association is a linear association. This type of relationship can be defined algebraically by the
equations used, numerically with actual or predicted data values, or graphically from a plotted curve. (Lines are classified
as straight curves.) Algebraically, a linear equation typically takes the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, x is
the independent variable, y is the dependent variable. In a statistical context, a linear equation is written in the form y = a +
bx, where a and b are the constants. This form is used to help readers distinguish the statistical context from the algebraic
context. In the equation y = a + bx, the constant b that multiplies the x variable (b is called a coefficient) is called as the
slope. The slope describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables; in other words, the rate of
change describes the change that occurs in the dependent variable as the independent variable is changed. In the equation
y = a + bx, the constant a is called as the y-intercept. Graphically, the y-intercept is the y coordinate of the point where the
graph of the line crosses the y axis. At this point x = 0.
The slope of a line is a value that describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables. The slope
tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average. The

y-intercept is used to describe the dependent variable when the independent variable equals zero. Graphically, the slope is
represented by three line types in elementary statistics.

13.4 The Regression Equation
It is hoped that this discussion of regression analysis has demonstrated the tremendous potential value it has as a tool for
testing models and helping to better understand the world around us. The regression model has its limitations, especially
the requirement that the underlying relationship be approximately linear. To the extent that the true relationship is nonlinear
it may be approximated with a linear relationship or nonlinear forms of transformations that can be estimated with linear
techniques. Double logarithmic transformation of the data will provide an easy way to test this particular shape of the
relationship. A reasonably good quadratic form (the shape of the total cost curve from Microeconomics Principles) can be
generated by the equation:

Y = a + b1 X + b2 X 2
where the values of X are simply squared and put into the equation as a separate variable.
There is much more in the way of econometric "tricks" that can bypass some of the more troublesome assumptions of the
general regression model. This statistical technique is so valuable that further study would provide any student significant,
statistically significant, dividends.

SOLUTIONS
1 d
2 A measure of the degree to which variation of one variable is related to variation in one or more other variables. The most
commonly used correlation coefficient indicates the degree to which variation in one variable is described by a straight line
relation with another variable. Suppose that sample information is available on family income and Years of schooling of the
head of the household. A correlation coefficient = 0 would indicate no linear association at all between these two variables.
A correlation of 1 would indicate perfect linear association (where all variation in family income could be associated with
schooling and vice versa).

4 b. 16
5 The coefficient of determination is r**2 with 0 ≤ r**2 ≤ 1, since -1 ≤ r ≤ 1.
6 True

Chapter 13 | Linear Regression and Correlation

7 d. on a scale from -1 to +1, the degree of linear relationship between the two variables is +.10
8 d. there exists no linear relationship between X and Y
9 Approximately 0.9
10 d. neither of the above changes will affect r.
11 Definition: A t test is obtained by dividing a regression coefficient by its standard error and then comparing the result
to critical values for Students' t with Error df. It provides a test of the claim that β i = 0 when all other variables have been
included in the relevant regression model. Example: Suppose that 4 variables are suspected of influencing some response.
Suppose that the results of fitting Y i = β 0 + β 1 X 1i + β 2 X 2i + β 3 X 3i + β 4 X 4i + e i include:

t calculated for variables 1, 2, and 3 would be 5 or larger in absolute value while that for variable 4 would be less than 1.
For most significance levels, the hypothesis β 1 = 0 would be rejected. But, notice that this is for the case when X 2 , X 3
, and X 4 have been included in the regression. For most significance levels, the hypothesis β 4 = 0 would be continued
(retained) for the case where X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 are in the regression. Often this pattern of results will result in computing

another regression involving only X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , and examination of the t ratios produced for that case.
12 c. those who score low on one test tend to score low on the other.

13 False. Since H 0 : β = −1 would not be rejected at α = 0.05 , it would not be rejected at α = 0.01 .
14 True
15 d
16 Some variables seem to be related, so that knowing one variable's status allows us to predict the status of the other. This
relationship can be measured and is called correlation. However, a high correlation between two variables in no way proves
that a cause-and-effect relation exists between them. It is entirely possible that a third factor causes both variables to vary
together.
17 True
18 Y j = b 0 + b 1 ⋅ X 1 + b 2 ⋅ X 2 + b 3 ⋅ X 3 + b 4 ⋅ X 4 + b 5 ⋅ X 6 + e j
19 d. there is a perfect negative relationship between Y and X in the sample.
20 b. low
21 The precision of the estimate of the Y variable depends on the range of the independent (X) variable explored. If we
explore a very small range of the X variable, we won't be able to make much use of the regression. Also, extrapolation is
not recommended.
^

22 y = −3.6 + (3.1 ⋅ 7) = 18.1
23 Most simply, since −5 is included in the confidence interval for the slope, we can conclude that the evidence
is consistent with the claim at the 95% confidence level. Using a t test: H 0 : B 1 = −5 H A : B 1 ≠ −5

t calculated =

−5 − (−4)
= −1 t critical = −1.96 Since t calc < t crit we retain the null hypothesis that B 1 = −5 .
