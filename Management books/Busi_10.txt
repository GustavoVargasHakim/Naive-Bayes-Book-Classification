as a product. Just as Johnson and Johnson sought to promote the moral development of its corporate
community by "challenging" its corporate credo, ADEM also seeks to promote its moral development by
challenging, interpreting, and realizing its Statement of Values.
Your task in this module is to read the appended Statement of Values (SOV) and provide two responses.
First, can you think of any problems that have arisen in the past that could have been avoided if this SOV
had been adopted and implemented? In other words, assess how eective you think the SOV is as a means
for preventing moral harm. Second, challenge the SOV: (1) Are there any interpretation problems you see
that would lead to misunderstanding and improper use? And (2) what SOV gaps do you see, that is, what
ethical issues remain that are not fully treated under the SOV?
Carrying out these tasks will help you identify creative ways to integrate moral values into your academic
endeavors in this class and in other activities this semester. The goal of the SOV is to set the ADEM
community on a course of continual improvement. These reective exercises will help start the process.

1.1.2 What you need to know . . .
Include information that you expect your students to study and learn in this module as well as information
that will help them carry out the module activities.

Figure 1.2:

SOV Preamble

As a result of an ongoing process of reection and assessment, the College of Business Administration
(its students, faculty, sta, and administrators) arms its commitment and loyalty to the following values:
justice and fairness, responsibility, respect, trust, and integrity. This statement sets forth these values in order
to educate and inspire as well as to promote dialogue and continual improvement. In particular, these values
serve to describe this community's identity and express its aspirations. It is meant to complement existing
laws, regulations, professional standards, and codes of ethics by enhancing the pursuit of excellence consistent
with the College's Vision and Mission. In all of its activities, the College of Business Administration will:
SOV Values

1. Justice / Fairness: Be impartial, objective and refrain from discrimination or preferential treatment
in the administration of rules and policies and in its dealings with students, faculty, sta, administration, and other stakeholders.
2. Responsibility: Recognize and fulll its obligations to its constituents by caring for their essential
interests, by honoring its commitments, and by balancing and integrating conicting interests. As
responsible agents, the faculty, employees, and students of the College of Business Administration are
committed to the pursuit of excellence, devotion to the community's welfare, and professionalism.
3. Respect:Acknowledge the inherent dignity present in its diverse constituents by recognizing and respecting their fundamental rights. These include rights to property, privacy, free exchange of ideas,
academic freedom, due process, and meaningful participation in decision making and policy formation.

4. Trust: Recognize that trust solidies communities by creating an environment where each can expect ethically justiable behavior from all others. While trust is tolerant of and even thrives in an
environment of diversity, it also must operate within the parameters set by established personal and
community standards.
5. Integrity: Promote integrity as characterized by sincerity, honesty, authenticity, and the pursuit of
excellence. Integrity shall permeate and color all its decisions, actions and expressions. It is most
clearly exhibited in intellectual and personal honesty in learning, teaching, mentoring and research.
Compliance Strategy

â€¢ The traditionally most prevalent method for interpreting codes of ethics and statements of values is the
compliance method. This method sets forth minimal standards and implements incentives for meeting
these standards. It is based on three interrelated components::
â€¢ Rules: Compliance strategies are centered around strict codes of ethics composed of rules that set
forth minimum thresholds of acceptable behavior. The use of rules to structure employee action does
run into problems due to the gap between rule and application, the appearance of novel situations, and
the impression that it gives to employees that obedience is based on conformity to authority.
â€¢ Monitoring: The second component consists of monitoring activities designed to ensure that employees are conforming to rules and to identify instances of non-compliance. Monitoring is certainly
eective but it requires that the organiztion expend time, money, and energy. Monitoring also places
stress upon employees in that they are aware of constantly being watched. Those under observation
tend either to rebel or to automatically adopt behaviors they believe those doing the monitoring want.
This considerably dampens creativity, legitimate criticism, and innovation.
â€¢ Disciplining Misconduct: The last key component to a compliance strategy is punishment. Punishment can be eective especially when establishing and enforcing conduct that remains above the
criminal level. But reliance on punishment for control tends to impose solidarity on an organization
rather than elicit it. Employees conform because they fear sanction. Organizations based on this fear
are never really free to pursue excellence.
Values Orientation

â€¢ The SOV can also be read as the identication and armation of a community's aspirations. By taking
on this values orientation, the SOV replaces the reactive compliance perspective with a proactive stance
oriented toward excellence. The emphasis here is on how the community can support its members by
identifying best practices toward realizing these aspirations and especially how it can provide support
to those who fall short. This values-based orientation is built upon the following three components
â€¢ Development of Shared Values: Using a process similar to the one described above, a community
develops a Statement of Shared Values. These provide guidelines that replace the hard and fast rules of
a compliance code. Statements in values-oriented codes play a dierent logical function than statements
in compliance codes. "Principles of Professional/Organizational Conduct" in compliance codes
specify circumstances of compliance: time, agent, place, purpose, manner, etc. These circumstances
provide sucient content to allow principles of professional conduct to function as rules that can
be violated. This gives them "teeth," that is, makes it possible to enforce them by sanctions and
punishments. "Ideals of the Profession/Organization state a community's shared aspirations.
They set forth levels of behavior well beyond the minimum. Because they chart out directions for
continuous improvement, Ideals of the Profession/Organization profess a community's commitment to
excellence rather than the moral minimum.
â€¢ Support for Employees: Since Statements of Values can set forth excellences or aspirations, the
role of the community changes from monitoring and punishing to helping community members realize
key values in their day to day activities. In other words, the role of the organization changes from
punitive to supportive.
â€¢ Ethical Aspirations: In summary, values orientations can be interpreted as setting forth higher
standards for behavior. Going well beyond the moral and legal minimum, these valueswhen claried in

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

a community's statement of valuesserve as aspirations. A values orientation requires that a community
design strategies that reinterpret and realize basic values as excellences. Hence, it is most compatible
with a virtue orientation and virtue ethical theory.

1.1.3 What you will do ...
Suppose the SOV has been adopted and implemented for several years now. Exercise your
moral imagination and envision problems that the pursuit of these excellences would have
avoided.
Question 1:
What kind of moral harms could it have prevented had it been in eect?
Question 2:

â€¢ Does the adaptation and implementation of the SOV promise to make us (ADEM stakeholders) a better community?

â€¢ If so, how?
â€¢ If not, what are its weaknesses?
â€¢ Nota Bene: If you feel that the adoption of the SOV will not make us a better community, feel free
to state this and then explain your position. Your rst item here
Challenging the Statement of Values
As in successful corporate compliance and values programs, the following exercise encourages
you to challenge the SOV by identifying interpretation problems and SOV gaps.
Question 3:
Can you anticipate any interpretation problems that may arise with the adaptation and
implementation of the SOV? How should these be addressed?
Question 4:
2. Can you identify important moral problems that are not covered or anticipated by the
Statement of Values? How could the SOV be modied to cover these problems and ll the
gaps?

1.1.4 What did you learn?
Reecting on what you have done is an absolutely essential part of the learning process. In this section
of the module, the class will be divided into small groups, and each group member begin by presenting
his or her responses to the above four questions. Explaining your responses to others in terms that they
understand and with reasons that you share with them helps you to see your own views in a dierent, more
comprehensive way. Listening to what others say helps to integrate new information and perspectives into
your thinking on an issue. In other words, it expands and deepens your own position.
After you explain your responses to the other members of your group, discuss how the SOV
can be embedded in everyday academic activities. How can SOV values be realized in...

â€¢ How does cheating aect relations of trust between students, especially between those who cheat and
those who don't?
â€¢ How can the practice of setting and holding oce hours lead to or undermine relations of respect
between teachers and students?
â€¢ How can academic integrity be interpreted as an aspiration? What would constitute an academic
integrity compliance program?
â€¢ Does the SOV pertain to recent changes in the class schedule at UPRM? Which values pertain and
why? Is an example of an SOV gap?
â€¢ Again, choose one of these for group discussion. If you have time, go to another.
Meta-Discussion

â€¢ A meta-discussion is a discussion about a discussion. Reecting on the discussion your
group has just had...

â€¢ Did you agree on most issues? Why do you think you all agreed? What did you do to prevent
groupthink, i.e., a group atmosphere where disagreement is covered over by various methods or means.
â€¢ Did you disagree?
â€¢ How did you respond to disagreement? For example, did you try to impose consensus.
â€¢ State as clearly as possible the dierent positions held by group members and how they diered

1.2 Theory Building Activities: Mountain Terrorist Exercise3
1.2.1 Module Introduction
This module poses an ethical dilemma, that is, a forced choice between two bad alternatives. Your job is to
read the scenario and choose between the two horns of the dilemma. You will make your choice and then
justify it in the rst activity. In the second activity, you will discuss your choice with others. Here, the
objective is to reach consensus on a course of action or describe the point at which your group's progress
toward consensus stopped. The Mountain Terrorist Exercise almost always generates lively discussion and
helps us to reect on of our moral beliefs. Don't expect to reach agreement with your fellow classmates
quickly or eortlessly. (If you do, then your instructor will nd ways of throwing a monkey wrench into the
whole process.) What is more important here is that we learn how to state our positions clearly, how to
listen to others, how to justify our positions, and how to assess the justications oered by others. In other
words, we will all have a chance to practice the virtue of reasonableness. And we will learn reasonableness
not when it's easy (as it is when we agree) but when it becomes dicult (as it is when we disagree).
The second half of this module requires that you reect carefully on your moral reasoning and that of
your classmates. The Mountain Terrorist Exercise triggers the dierent moral schemas that make up our
psychological capacity for moral judgment. Choosing one horn of the dilemma means that you tend to favor
one kind of schema while choosing the other horn generally indicates that your favor another. The dominant
moral theories that we will study this semester provide detailed articulations and justications of these moral
schemas. Reecting on your choice, the reasons for your choice, and how your choice diers from that of
your classmates will help you get started on the path of studying and eectively utilizing moral theory.
The following scenario comes originally from the philosopher, Bernard Williams. It is also presented in
introductory ethics textbooks (such as Georey Thomas' An Introduction to Ethics). The rst time this
module's author became aware of its use in the classroom was in a workshop on Agriculture Ethics led by
Paul Thompson, then of Texas A&M University, in 1992.

1.2.2 Moral Theories Highlighted
1. Utilitarianism: the moral value of an action lies in its consequences or results
2. Deontology: the moral value of an action lies, not in its consequences, but in the formal characteristics
of the action itself.
3. Virtue Ethics: Actions sort themselves out into virtuous or vicious actions. Virtuous actions stem from
a virtuous character while vicious actions stem from a vicious or morally awed character. Who we
are is reveals through what we do.

1.2.3 Mountain Terrorist Scenario
You are in a remote mountain village. A group of terrorists has lined up 20 people from the village; they
plan on shooting them for collaborating with the enemy. Since you are not from the village, you will not be
killed. Taking advantage of your position, you plead with the terrorists not to carry out their plan. Finally,
you convince the leader that it is not necessary to kill all 20. He takes a gun, empties it of all its bullets
except one, and then hands it to you. He has decided to kill only one villager to set an example to the rest.
As an honored guest and outsider, you will decide who will be killed, and you will carry out the deed. The
terrorists conclude with a warning; if you refuse to kill the villager, then they will revert back to the original
plan of killing all 20. And if you try any funny business, they will kill the 20 villagers and then kill you.
What should you do?

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

Your Options

1. Take the gun, select a villager, and kill him or her.
2. Refuse the terrorists' oer and walk away from the situation.
Spanish Translation by Dr. Halley Sanchez

El Terrorista de la MontaÃ±a TÃº eres un antropÃ³logo que por un mes ha estado viviendo con y observando (o
sea, estudiando) a los residents de una aldea en una area remota montaÃ±oza de un pais en AmÃ©rica Latina.
El dÃ­a que te dispone irte de la aldea, aprece un grupo de hombres armados que reÃºnen a los aldeanos y
les anuncian que se han enterado de que ellos han estado cooperando con el gobierno represivo y que, como
lecciÃ³n, han de ejecutar viente de ellos. El lÃ­der de los terroristas te mira y te dice que tÃº te puedes ir,
ya que no estÃ¡s involucardo en la lucha patriÃ³tica y que ellos no estÃ¡n en la costumbre de tomar rehÃ©nes
extranjeros. Debido a que te da la impresiÃ³n de que el lÃ­der de los supuestos patriÃ³tas (terroristas?) es un
hombre educado, tÃº te atreves tratar de razonar con Ã©l. Le explica que llevas un mes en la aldea y que los
aldeanos no han cooperado de forma volutaria con el gobierno. SÃ­, por supuesto, las tropas del gobierno
pasaron por la aldea y conscaron algunas provisiones, pero los aldeanos no se las dieron libremente sino que
estaban indefenso y no podieron prevenir que le conscaran las mismas. El lÃ­der piensa un tiempo y te dice
que por tÃº ser forastero y obviamente un antropÃ³logo estudioso, te va a dar el benicio de la duda, y que por
tanto no van a ejecutar viente aldeanos. Pero dado que la lucha patriÃ³tica estÃ¡ en un proceso crÃ­tico y que
la aldea sÃ­ le proveyÃ³ provisiones al gobierno, por el bien de la lucha patriÃ³tica y el bien de la humanidad,
es menester darle una lecciÃ³n a la aldea. AsÃ­ que tan sÃ³lo han de ejecutar un aldeano. MÃ¡s, como huesped,
tÃº has de escoger quiÃ©n ha de morir y tÃº has de matarlo tÃº mismo. Te da una pistola con una sola bala y te
dice que proceda, mientras que a la vez te advierte que de tratar algo heroico, te ejecutarÃ¡n inmediatamente
y procederÃ¡n a ejecutar a los viente aldeanos como dijeron al comienzo. TÃº eres el antropÃ³logo. Â¾QuÃ© harÃ¡s?
Activity 1

In a short essay of 1 to 2 pages describe what you would do if you were in the position of the tourist. Then
justify your choice.
Activity 2

Bring your essay to class. You will be divided into small groups. Present your choice and justication to
the others in your group. Then listen to their choices and justications. Try to reach a group consensus on
choice and justication. (You will be given 10-15 minutes.) If you succeed present your results to the rest of
the class. If you fail, present to the class the disagreement that blocked consensus and what you did (within
the time limit) to overcome it.

1.2.4 Taxonomy of Ethical Approaches
There are many ethical approaches that can be used in decision making. The Mountain Terrorist Exercise
is based on an articial scenario designed to separate these theoretical approaches along the lines of the
dierent "horns" of a dilemma. Utilitarians tend to choose to shoot a villager "in order to save 19." In other
words they focus their analysis on the consequences of an action alternative and choose the one that produces
the least harm. Deontologists generally elect to walk away from the situation. This is because they judge an
action on the basis of its formal characteristics. A deontologist might argue that killing the villager violates
natural law or cannot be made into a law or rule that consistently applies to everybody. A deontologist
might say something like, "What right do I have to take another person's life?" A virtue ethicists might try
to imagine how a person with the virtue of courage or integrity would act in this situaiton. (Williams claims
that choosing to kill the villager, a duty under utilitarianism, would undermine the integrity of a person who
abhorred killing.)
Table Connecting Theory to Domain

1. Row 1: Utilitarianism concerns itself with consequences. It claims that the moral value of an action is
"colored" by its results. The harm test, which asks us to choose the least harmful alternative, encapsulates or summarizes this theoretical approach. The basic principle of utilitarianism is the principle
of utility: choose that action that produces the greatest good for the greatest number. Utilitarians

would shoot a villager in order to save 19. But Utilitarianism, like other forms of consequentialism, has
prediction challenges. What are the short-, middle-, and long-term consequences of an action? These
become harder to determine the further we are from the present.
2. Row 2: Npn-consequentialism turns away from consequences to focus on the formal characteristics of
an action. (For example, Kant says the good action is one that does duty for duty's sake.) Deontology,
a kind of non-consequentialism, helps us to identify and justify rights along with their correlative duties
The reversibility test summarizes deontology by asking the question, "Does your action still work if
you switch (=reverse) roles with those on the receiving end? Deontology has two formulations of its
fundamental principle. The Categorical Imperative exhorts us to act only on that maxim which
can be converted into a universal law. The Formula of the End proscribes that we "treat others
always as ends, never merely as means," The rights that represent special cases of treating people as
ends and not merely as means include (a) informed consent, (b) privacy, (c) due process, (d) property,
(e) free speech, and (f) conscientious objection. The deontologist would choose not to kill a villager
because the act of killing is formally wrong.
3. Row 3: Virtue ethics turns away from the action and focuses on the agent, the person performing the
action. The word, "Virtue," refers to dierent sets of skills and habits cultivated by agents. These skills
and habits, consistently and widely performed, support, sustain, and advance dierent occupational,
social, and professional practices. (See MacIntyre, After Virtue, and Solomon, Ethics and Excellence,
for more on the relation of virtues to practices.) The public identication test summarizes this approach: an action is morally acceptable if it is one with which I would willingly be publicly associated
given my moral convictions. Individual virtues that we will use this semester include integrity, justice,
responsibility, reasonableness, honesty, trustworthiness, and loyalty.

â€¢ These dierent approaches are meant to work together. Each gives us insight into dierent dimensions
of the problematic situation. Utilitarianism and deontology both focus on the action. Utilitarianism
uses consequences to evaluate the action while deontology evaluates an action in terms of its underlying
motive and its formal characteristics.
â€¢ Virtue ethics turns away from the action to focus on the agent. It asks us to determine what the
action says about the character or person of the agent. If the action is irresponsible, then the agent
is irresponsible. Virtue ethics can be implemented by projecting a moral exemplar into the situation.
You might ask, "What would so-and-so do in this situation?" if this person were your mentor, a person
you admire, or a moral exemplar. Or you might examine virtues that are realized through your action.
For example, Williams says that taking the life of a villager might seriously disrupt or corrupt your
integrity.
â€¢ The capability approach takes a still dierent focus on the situation by having us bring into view
those factors in the situation which could empower or impede the expression of human capabilities like
thought, imagination, movement, health, and life.

1.2.5 Comments on the Relation Between Ethical Approaches
The Mountain Terrorist Exercise has, in the past, given students the erroneous idea that ethical approaches
are necessarily opposed to one another. As one student put it, "If deontology tells us to walk away from
the village, then utilitarianism must tell us to stay and kill a villager because deontology and utilitarianism, as dierent and opposed theories, always reach dierent and opposed conclusions on the actions they
recommend." The Mountain Terrorist dilemma was specially constructed by Bernard Williams to produce
a situation that oered only a limited number of alternatives. He then tied these alternatives to dierent
ethical approaches to separate them precisely because in most real world situations they are not so readily
distinguishable. Later this semester, we will turn from these philosophical puzzles to real world cases where
ethical approaches function in a very dierent and mostly complimentary way. As we will see, ethical approaches, for the most part, converge on the same solutions. For this reason, this module concludes with 3
meta-tests. When approaches converge on a solution, this strengthens the solution's moral validity. When
approaches diverge on a solution, this weakens their moral validity. A third meta-test tells us to avoid framing all ethical problems as dilemmas (=forced choices between undesirable alternatives) or what Carolyn
Whitbeck calls "multiple-choice" problems. You will soon learn that eective moral problem solving requires
moral imagination and moral creativity. We do not "nd" solutions "out there" ready made but design them
to harmonize and realize ethical and practical values.
Meta-Tests

â€¢ Divergence Test: When two ethical approaches dier on a given solution, then that dierence counts
against the strength of the solution. Solutions on which ethical theories diverge must be revised towards
convergence.
â€¢ Convergence Test: Convergence represents a meta-test that attests to solution strength. Solutions on
which dierent theoretical approaches converge are, by this fact, strengthened. Convergence demonstrates that a solution is strong, not just over one domain, but over multiple domains.
â€¢ Avoid Framing a Problem as a Dilemma. A dilemma is a no-win situation that oers only two alternatives of action both of which are equally bad. (A trilemma oers three bad alternatives, etc.)
Dilemmas are better dissolved than solved. Reframe the dilemma into something that admits of more

11
than two no-win alternatives. Dilemma framing (framing a situation as an ethical dilemma) discourages us from designing creative solutions that integrate the conicting values that the dilemma poses
as incompatible.

1.2.6 Module Wrap-Up
1. Reasonableness and the Mountain Terrorist Exercise. It may seem that this scenario is the last
place where the virtue of reasonableness should prevail, but look back on how you responded to those
of your classmates who chose dierently in this exercise and who oered arguments that you had not
initially thought of. Did you "listen and respond thoughtfully" to them? Were you "open to new ideas"
even if these challenged your own? Did you "give reasons for" your views, modifying and shaping them
to respond to your classmates' arguments? Did you "acknowledge mistakes and misunderstandings"
such as responding critically and personally to a classmate who put forth a dierent view? Finally, when
you turned to working with your group, were you able to "compromise (without compromising personal
integrity)"? If you did any or all of these things, then you practiced the virtue of reasonableness as
characterized by Michael Pritchard in his book, Reasonable Children: Moral Education and Moral
Learning (1996, University of Kansas Press, p. 11). Congratulate yourself on exercising reasonableness
in an exercise designed to challenge this virtue. You passed the test.
2. Recognizing that we are already making ethical arguments. In the past, students have made
the following arguments on this exercise: (a) I would take the gun and kill a villager in order to
save nineteen; (b) I would walk away because I don't have the right to take another's life; (c) While
walking away might appear cowardly it is the responsible thing to do because staying and killing a
villager would make me complicit in the terrorists' project. As we discussed in class, these and other
arguments make use of modes of thought captured by ethical theories or approaches. The rst employs
the consequentialist approach of utilitarianism while the second makes use of the principle of respect
that forms the basis of our rights and duties. The third works through a conict between two virtues,
courage and responsibility. This relies on the virtue approach. One accomplishment of this exercise
is to make you aware of the fact that you are already using ethical arguments, i.e., arguments that
appeal to ethical theory. Learning about the theories behind these arguments will help you to makes
these arguments more eectively.
3. Results from Muddy Point Exercises The Muddy Point Exercises you contributed kept coming
back to two points. (a) Many of you pointed out that you needed more information to make a decision
in this situation. For example, who were these terrorists, what causes were they ghting for, and were
they correct in accusing the village of collaborating with the enemy? Your request for more information
was quite appropriate. But many of the cases we will be studying this semester require decisions in the
face of uncertainty and ignorance. These are unavoidable in some situations because of factors such as
the cost and time of gathering more information. Moral imagination skillfully exercised can do a lot
to compensate when all of the facts are not in. (b) Second, many of you felt overly constrained by the
dilemma framing of the scenario. Those of you who entered the realm of "funny business" (anything
beyond the two alternatives of killing the villager or walking away) took a big step toward eective
moral problem solving. By rejecting the dilemma framing of this scenario, you were trying to reframe
the situation to allow for moreand more ethically viablealternatives. Trying to negotiate with the
Terrorists is a good example of reframing the scenario to admit of more ethical alternatives of action
than killing or walking away.
4. Congratulations on completing your rst ethics module! You have begun recognizing and practicing
skills that will help you to tackle real life ethical problems. (Notice that we are going to work with
"problems" not "dilemmas".) We will now turn, in the next module, to look at those who managed
to do good in the face of diculty. Studying moral exemplars will provide the necessary corrective to
the "no-win" Mountain Terrorist Exercise.

Ethics of Team Work
William J. Frey (working with material developed by Chuck Hu at St. Olaf College
Centro de la Etica en las Profesiones
University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez

1.3.1 Module Introduction
Much of your future work will be organized around group or team activities. This module is designed to
prepare you for this by getting you to reect on ethical and practical problems that arise in small groups like
work teams. Four issues, based on well-known ethical values, are especially important. How do groups achieve
justice (in the distribution of work), responsibility (in specifying tasks, assigning blame, and awarding credit),
reasonableness (ensuring participation, resolving conict, and reaching consensus), and honesty (avoiding
deception, corruption, and impropriety)? This module asks that you develop plans for realizing these moral
values in your group work this semester. Furthermore, you are provided with a list of some of the more
common pitfalls of group work and then asked to devise strategies for avoiding them. Finally, at the end of
the semester, you will review your goals and strategies, reect on your successes and problems, and carry
out an overall assessment of the experience.

1.3.2 Module Activities
1. Groups are provided with key ethical values that they describe and seek to realize thorugh group
activity.
2. Groups also study various obstacles that arise in collective activity: the Abilene Paradox, Groupthink,
and Group Polarization.
3. Groups prepare initial reports consisting of plans for realizing key values in their collective activity.
They also develop strategies for avoiding associated obstacles.
4. At the end of the semester, groups prepare a self-evaluation that assesses success in realizing ethical
values and avoiding obstacles.
5. Textboxes in this module describe pitfalls in groups activities and oer general strategies for preventing
or mitigating them. There is also a textbox that provides an introductory orientation on key ethical
values or virtues.

1.3.3 A Framework for Value-Integration
The objective of this module is to teach you to teach yourselves how to work in small groups. You will
develop and test procedures for realizing value goals and avoiding group pitfalls. You will also use SocioTechnical System Analysis to help you understand better how to take advantage of the way in which dierent
environments enable groups activities and to anticipate and minimize the way in which other environments
can constrain or even oppose group activities.

â€¢ Discovery: "The goal of this activity is to 'discover' the values that are relevant to, inspire, or inform
a given design project, resulting in a list of values and bringing into focus what is often implicit in a
design project." [Flanagan et al. 323]. Discovery of group values is a trial and error process. To get
started, use the ADEM Statement of Values or the short value proles listed below.
â€¢ Translation: "[T]ranslation is the activity of embodying or expressing...values in a system design.
Translation is further divided into operationalization, which involves dening or articulating values in
concrete terms, and implementation which involves specifying corresponding design features" [Flanagan

13
et al., 338]. You will operationalize your values by developing proles. (See below or the ADEM
Statement of Values for examples.) Then you will implement your values by developing realization
procedures. For example, to realize justice in carrying out a group task, rst we will discuss the task
as a group, second we will divide it into equal parts, third, forth, etc.
â€¢ Verication: "In the activity of verication, designers assess to what extent they have successfully
implemented target values in a given system. [Strategies and methods] may include internal testing
among the design team, user testing in controlled environments, formal and informal interviews and
surveys, the use of prototypes, traditional quality assurance measures such as automated and regressionoriented testing and more" [Flanagan et al., 344-5]. You will document your procedures in the face of
dierent obstacles that may arise in your eorts at value-realization. At the end of your semester, you
will verify your results by showing how you have rened procedures to more eectively realize values.
The framework on value realization and the above-quoted passages can be found in the following resource:
M. Flanagan, D. Howe, and H. Nissenbaum, Embodying Values in Technology: Theory and Practice,
in Information Technology and Moral Philosophy, Jeroen van den Hoven and John Weckert, Eds.
Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2008, pp. 322-353.

1.3.4 Value Proles for Professional Ethics
1. Denition - A value "refers to a claim about what is worthwhile, what is good. A value is a single word
or phrase that identies something as being desirable for human beings." Brincat and Wike, Morality
and the Professional Life: Values at Work
2. Reasonableness - Defusing disagreement and resolving conicts through integration. Characteristics
include seeking relevant information, listening and responding thoughtfully to others, being open to
new ideas, giving reasons for views held, and acknowledging mistakes and misunderstandings. (From
Michael Pritchard, Reasonable Children)
3. Responsibility - The ability to develop moral responses appropriate to the moral issues and problems
that arise in one's day-to-day experience. Characteristics include avoiding blame shifting, designing
overlapping role reponsibilities to ll responsibility "gaps", expanding the scope and depth of general
and situation-specic knowledge, and working to expand control and power.
4. Respect - Recognizing and working not to circumvent the capacity of autonomy in each individual.
Characteristics include honoring rights such as privacy, property, free speech, due process, and participatory rights such as informed consent. Disrespect circumvents autonomy by deception, force, or
manipulation.
5. Justice - Giving each his or her due. Justice breaks down into kinds such as distributive (dividing
benets and burdens fairly), retributive (fair and impartial administration of punishments), administrative (fair and impartial administration of rules), and compensatory (how to fairly recompense those
who have been wrongfully harmed by others).
6. Trust - According to Solomon, trust is the expectation of moral behavior from others.
7. Honesty - Truthfulness as a mean between too much honesty (bluntness which harms) and dishonesty
(deceptiveness, misleading acts, and mendaciousness).
8. Integrity - A meta-value that refers to the relation between particular values. These values are integrated with one another to form a coherent, cohesive and smoothly functioning whole. This resembles
Solomon's account of the virtue of integrity.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

2. Give a brief description of each using terms that reect your group's shared understandings. You may
use the descriptions in this module or those in the ADEM Statement of Values but feel free to modify
these to t your group's context. You could also add characteristics and sample rules and aspirations.
3. For each value goal, identify and spell out a procedure for realizing it. See the examples just below for
questions that can help you develop value procedures for values like justice and responsibility.
Examples

â€¢ Design a plan for realizing key moral values of team work. Your plan should address the following
value-based tasks
â€¢ How does your group plan on realizing justice? For example, how will you assign tasks within the
group that represent a fair distribution of the work load and, at the same time, recognize dierences
in individual strengths and weaknesses? How does your group plan on dealing with members who fail
to do their fair share?
â€¢ How does your group plan on realizing responsibility? For example, what are the responsibilities that
members will take on in the context of collective work? Who will be the leader? Who will play devil's
advocate to avoid groupthink? Who will be the spokesperson for the group? How does your group
plan to make clear to each individual his or her task or role responsibilities?
â€¢ How does your group plan on implementing the value of reasonableness? How will you guarantee
that each individual participates fully in group decisions and activities? How will you deal with the
dierences, non-agreements, and disagreements that arise within the group? What process will your
group use to reach agreement? How will your group insure that every individual has input, that each
opinion will be heard and considered, and that each individual will be respected?
â€¢ How does your group plan on implementing the value of (academic) honesty? For example, how will
you avoid cheating or plagiarism? How will you detect plagiarism from group members, and how will
you respond to it?
â€¢ Note: Use your imagination here and be specic on how you plan to realize each value. Think preventively (how you plan on avoiding injustice, irresponsibility, injustice, and dishonesty) and proactively
(how you can enhance these values). Don't be afraid to outline specic commitments. Expect some of
your commitments to need reformulation. At the end of the semester, this will help you write the nal
report. Describe what worked, what did not work, and what you did to x the latter.

1.3.6 Obstacles to Group Work (Developed by Chuck Hu for Good Computing:
A Virtue Approach to Computer Ethics)
1. The Abilene Paradox. "The story involves a family who would all rather have been at home that
ends up having a bad dinner in a lousy restaurant in Abilene, Texas. Each believes the others want
to go to Abilene and never questions this by giving their own view that doing so is a bad idea. In
the Abilene paradox, the group winds up doing something that no individual wants to do because of a
breakdown of intra-group communication." (From Hu, Good Computing, an unpublished manuscript
for a textbook in computer ethics. See materials from Janis; complete reference below.)
2. Groupthink. The tendency for very cohesive groups with strong leaders to disregard and defend
against information that goes against their plans and beliefs. The group collectively and the members
individually remain loyal to the party line while happily marching o the cli, all the while blaming
them (i.e., outsiders) for the height and situation of the cli. (Also from Hu, Good Computing,
an unpublished manuscript for a textbook in computer ethics.)
3. Group Polarization. Here, individuals within the group choose to frame their dierences as disagreements. Framing a dierence as non-agreement leaves open the possibility of working toward
agreement by integrating the dierences or by developing a more comprehensive standpoint that dialectally synthesizes the dierences. Framing a dierence as disagreement makes it a zero sum game;
one's particular side is good, all the others bad, and the only resolution is for the good (one's own position) to win out over the bad (everything else). (Weston provides a nice account of group polarization
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

15
in Practical Companion to Ethics. This is not to be confused with Cass Sunstein's dierent account
of group polarization in Infotopia.)
4. Note: All of these are instances of a social psychological phenomenon called conformity. But there
are other processes at work too, like group identication, self-serving biases, self-esteem enhancement,
self-fullling prophecies, etc.
More Obstacles to Group Work

â€¢ Free Riders: Free riders are individuals who attempt to "ride for free" on the work of the other
members of the group. Some free riders cynically pursue their selsh agenda while others fall into this
pitfall because they are unable to meet all their obligations. (See conict of eort.)
â€¢ Outliers: These are often mistaken for free riders. Outliers want to become participants but fail to
become fully integrated into the group. This could be because they are shy and need encouragement
from the other group members. It could also be because the other group members know one another
well and have habitual modes of interaction that exclude outsiders. One sign of outliers; they do
not participate in group social activities but they still make substantial contributions working by
themselves. ("No, I can't come to the meetingjust tell me what I have to do.")
â€¢ Hidden Agendas: Cass Sunstein introduces this term. A group member with a "hidden agenda"
has something he or she wants to contribute but, for some reason or other, hold back. For example,
this individual may have tried to contribute something in the past and was "shot down" by the group
leader. The next time he or she will think, "Let them gure it out without me."
â€¢ Conict of Eort: conict of Eort often causes an individual to become a free rider or an outlier.
These group members have made too many commitments and come unraveled when they all come
due at the same time. Students are often overly optimistic when making out their semester schedules.
They tightly couple work and class schedules while integrating home responsibilities. Everything goes
well as long as nothing unusual happens. But if a coworker gets sick and your supervisor asks you to
come in during class times to help out, or you get sick, it becomes impossible to keep the problem
from "spilling out" into other areas of your schedule and bringing down the whole edice. Developing
a schedule with periods of slack and exibility can go a long way toward avoiding conict of eort.
Groups can deal with this by being supportive and exible. (But it is important to draw the line
between being supportive and carrying a free rider.)
Best Practices for Avoiding Abilene Paradox

â€¢ At the end of the solution generating process, carry out an anonymous survey asking participants if
anything was left out they were reluctant to put before group.
â€¢ Designate a Devil's Advocate charged with criticizing the group's decision.
â€¢ Ask participants to rearm group decisionperhaps anonymously.
Best Practices for Avoiding Groupthink (Taken from Janis, 262-271)

â€¢ "The leader of a policy-forming group should assign the role of critical evaluator to each member,
encouraging the group to give high priority to airing objections and doubts."
â€¢ "The leaders in an organization's hierarchy, when assigning a policy-planning mission to a group, should
be impartial instead of stating preferences and expectations at the outset."
â€¢ "Throughout the period when the feasibility and eectiveness of policy alternatives are being surveyed, the policy-making group should from time to time divide into two or more subgroups to meet
separately...."
â€¢ One or more outside experts or qualied colleagues within the organization who are not core members
of the policy-making group should be invited to each meeting ...and should be encouraged to challenge
the views of the core members."
â€¢ "At every meeting devoted to evaluating policy alternatives, at least one member should be assigned
the role of devil's advocate."

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

Best Practices for Avoiding Polarizatoin (Items taken from "Good Computing: A Virtue
Approach to Computer Ethics" by Chuck Hu, William Frey and Jose Cruz (Unpublished
Manuscript)

â€¢ Set Quotas. When brainstorming, set a quota and postpone criticism until after quota has been met.
â€¢ Negotiate Interests, not Positions. Since it is usually easier to integrate basic interests than
specic positions, try to frame the problem in terms of interests.
â€¢ Expanding the Pie. Concts that arise from situational constraints can be resolved by pushing back
those constraints through negotiation or innovation..
â€¢ Nonspecic Compensation. One side makes a concession to the other but is compensated for that
concession by some other coin.
â€¢ Logrolling. Each party lowers their aspirations on items that are of less interest to them, thus trading
o a concession on a less important item for a concession from the other on a more important item.
â€¢ Cost-Cutting. One party makes an agreement to reduce its aspirations on a particular thing, and the
other party agrees to compensate the party for the specic costs that reduction in aspirations involves.
â€¢ Bridging. Finding a higher order interest on which both parties agree, and then constructing a
solution that serves that agreed-upon interest.

1.3.7 Exercise 2 - Avoiding the Pitfalls of Group Work

â€¢
â€¢
â€¢

Design a plan for avoiding the pitfalls of group work enumerated in the textbox above.
How does your group plan on avoiding the Abilene Paradox?
How does your group plan on avoiding Group Polarization?
How does your group plan on avoiding Groupthink?
Note: Use imagination and creativity here. Think of specic scenarios where these obstacles may arise,
and what your group can do to prevent them or minimize their impact.

1.3.8 Exercise 3: Socio Technical System
Your group work this semester will take place within a group of nested or overlapping environments. Taken
separately and together, these will structure and channel your activity, facilitating action in certain circumstances while constraining, hindering, or blocking it in others. Prepare a socio-technical system table
for your group to help structure your group self-evaluation. Include hardware/software, physical surroundings, stakeholders (other groups, teacher, other classes, etc.), procedures (realizing values, avoiding pitfalls),
university regulations (attendance), and information structures (collecting, sharing, disseminating)
Some things about Socio-Technical Systems

1. Socio-Technical System Analysis provides a tool to uncover the dierent environments in which business
activity takes place and to articulate how these constrain and enable dierent business practices.
2. A socio-technical system can be divided into dierent components such as hardware, software, physical
surroundings, people/groups/roles, procedures, laws/statutes/regulations, and information systems.
3. But while these dierent components can be distinguished, they are in the nal analysis inseparable.
STSs are, rst and foremost, systems composed of interrelated and interacting parts.
4. STSs also embody values such as moral values (justice, responsibility, respect, trust, integrity) and
non-moral values (eciency, satisfaction, productivity, eectiveness, and protability). These values
can be located in one or more of the system components. They come into conict with one another
causing the system to change.
5. STSs change and this change traces out a path or trajectory. The normative challenge of STS analysis
is to nd the trajectory of STS change and work to make it as value-realizing as possible.

1.3.9 Exercise 4: Prepare a Final, Group Self-Evaluation
Due Date: One week after the last class of the semester when your group turns in all its materials.
Length: A minimum of ve pages not including Team Member Evaluation Forms
Contents:
1. Restate the Ethical and Practical Goals that your group developed at the beginning of its formation.
2. Provide a careful, documented assessment of your group's success in meeting these goals. (Don't
just assert that Our group successfully realized justice in all its activities this semester. How did
your group characterize justice in the context of its work? What specic activities did the group carry
out to realize this value? What, among these activities, worked and what did not work?)
â€¢ 3. Identify obstacles, shortcomings or failures that you group experienced during the semester. How
did these arise? Why did they arise? How did you respond to them? Did your response work? What
did you learn from this experience?
â€¢ 4. Assess the plans you set forth in your initial report on how you intended to realize values and avoid
pitfalls. How did these work? Did you stick to your plans or did you nd it necessary to change or
abandon them in the face of challenges?
â€¢ 5. Discuss your group's procedures and practices? How did you divide and allocate work tasks? How
did you reach consensus on dicult issues? How did you ensure that all members were respected and
allowed signicant and meaningful participation? What worked and what did not work with respect
to these procedures? Will you repeat them in the future? Would you recommend these procedures as
best practices to future groups?

1.3.10 Wrap Up: Some further points to consider...
1. Don't gloss over your work with generalizations like, Our group was successful and achieved all of its
ethical and practical goals this semester. Provide evidence for success claims. Detail the procedures
designed by your group to bring about these results. Are they best practices? What makes them
best practices?
2. Sometimesespecially if diculties aroseit is dicult to reect on your group's activities for the
semester. Make the eort. Schedule a meeting after the end of the semester to nalize this reection.
If things worked well, what can you do to repeat these successes in the future? If things didn't work
out, what can you do to avoid similar problems in the future? Be honest, be descriptive and avoid
blame language.
3. This may sound harsh but get used to it. Self-evaluationsgroup and individualare an integral part
of professional life. They are not easy to carry out, but properly done they help to secure success and
avoid future problems.
4. Student groupsperhaps yoursoften have problems. This self-evaluation exercise is designed to help
you face them rather than push them aside. Look at your goals. Look at the strategies you set forth for

1.4 Moral Exemplars in Business and Professional Ethics11
1.4.1 Module Introduction
Through the activities of this module you will learn to balance cautionary tales in business and professional
ethics with new stories about those who consistently act in a morally exemplary way. While cautionary
tales teach us what to avoid, narratives from the lives of moral exemplars show us how to be good. A study
of moral best practices in business and professional ethics shows that moral exemplars exhibit positive and
learnable skills. This module, then, looks at moral exemplars in business and the professions, outlines their
outstanding accomplishments, and helps you to unpack the strategies they use to overcome obstacles to
doing good.
You will begin by identifying outstanding individuals in business and associated practices who have
developed moral "best practices." Your task is look at these individuals, retell their stories, identify the skills
that help them do good, and build a foundation for a more comprehensive study of virtue in occupational
and professional ethics.

1.4.2 Moral Exemplar Terms

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

â€¢ Moral exemplars perform actions that are "above and beyond the call of duty."
â€¢ Most important, they perform these actions repeatedly across a career or even a lifetime. In some way,
their exemplary conduct has become "second nature."
Supererogatory

â€¢ "A supererogatory act is an act that is beyond the call of duty. It is something that is
morally good to do but not obligatory. Examples of supererogatory acts are donating
blood, volunteering on a rape crisis hotline, babysitting (without accepting recompense) a
friend's two-year old triplets for the afternoon, or throwing oneself on a live hand grenade
in order to save one's buddies' lives." (Baron, 1997: 614)

â€¢ Baron's denition (found in the Encyclopedia of Business Ethics) captures how the supererogatory
occupies a moral space well above that of the minimally decent or even the ordinary.Your second
item here. Supererogatory actions are outstanding, extra-ordinary, and exemplary in both moral and
practical senses.
â€¢ Urmsom, a moral philosopher, remarks how the supererogatory has been neglected (up to the midtwentieth century) by moral philosophy, dominated as it was in the previous century by the debate
between Utilitarianism and Deontology.
â€¢ Two quotations from Urmson show this clearly: (1)But it does seem that these facts have

been neglected in their general, systematic accounts of morality. It is indeed easy to see
that on some of the best-known theories there is no room for such facts (Urmson, 1958,
p. 206). (2)[s]imple utilitarianism, Kantianism, and intuitionism, then, have no obvious
theoretical niche for the saint and the hero (Urmson, 1958: 207).

â€¢ Baron, M. (1997). Supererogation, Blackwell Encyclopedic Dictionary of Business Ethics, Patricia
H. Werhane and R. Edward Freeman, eds., New York: Blackwell: 614-7.
â€¢ Urmson, J.O. (1958). Saints and Heroes. Essays in Moral Philosophy, A.I. Melden, ed., Seattle:
University of Washington Press: 198-216.
Moral Minimum

â€¢ Compare and distinguish the idea of the supererogatory with that of the moral minimum.
â€¢ The dierence is between that which is morally exemplary versus that which is just over the threshold
of wrongdoing.
â€¢ "I suggest that moral minimums are best understood as negative standards, universally
agreed upon bottom lines beyond which it is morally questionable to act. For example,
it is almost always wrong to deliberately harm or contribute to harming another person
or persons; to deliberately violate their rights to freedom, life, or property; to treat
individuals or classes of individuals with disrespect; to compete or cooperate unfairly;
not to honor promises or contract; or to be dishonest or deceitful. Whereas these moral
minimums do not dene goodness, fairness, or benet, or dene the positive content of
rights, they set minimum guidelines for behavior that most people everywhere might
agree on. . .." (Werhane, 1999: 122).

Moral Exemplar Criteria in Computing

1. Either a sustained commitment to moral ideals or ethical principles in computing that include a generalized respect for humanity or sustained evidence of moral virtue in the practice of computing.
2. A disposition to make computing decisions in accord with one's moral ideals or ethical principles,
implying a consistency between one's actions and intentions and between the means and ends of one's
actions
3. A willingness to risk one's self interest for the sake of one's moral values.

21
4. A tendency to be inspiring to other computer professional and thereby to move them to moral action
5. A sense of realistic humility about one's own importance relative to the world at large, implying a
relative lack of concern for one's own ego.
6. Hu, C. and Barnard, L. (2009). Good Computing: Moral Exemplars in the Computing Profession,
IEEE Technology and Society Magazine: 47-54.
Responders and Idealists

â€¢ This quotation from Blum provides a nice characterization of "moral responders."
â€¢ "the 'responder' moral exemplar does not, prior to confronting situations in which she manifests moral
excellence, possess a set of moral principles which she has worked out explicitly, committed herself to,
and attempted to guide her life by."
â€¢ "the responder respnods to the situations she faces and to individuals in a 'morally excellent way.'".
â€¢ Blum, L. (1994). Moral Exemplars: reections on Schindler, the TrochmÃ©s, and others, Moral Perception and Particularity, Cambridge, Mass.: Cambridge University Press: 65-97.
Idealists

â€¢ According to Blum (and Hailie), Magda Trochme is a responder while her husband, Andre Trochme is
an idealist. Both perform morally exemplary and supererogatory actions but out of dierent motivations.
â€¢ "To be an idealist [one] must see these ideals as more than merely personal goals or a personal conception of the good. They must be formulated as general values, and regarded by the agent as having
some kind of intrinsic worth or general validity.
â€¢ Blum, L. (1994). Moral Exemplars: reections on Schindler, the TrochmÃ©s, and others, Moral Perception and Particularity, Cambridge, Mass.: Cambridge University Press: 65-97.
Moral Heroes and Moral Saints

â€¢ Moral heroes achieve their good and excellent goals only by making substantial sacrices. The notion
of self-sacrice is the key distinguishing characteristic of this kind of exemplar.
â€¢ What distinguishes moral saints from other kinds of moral exemplar is the criterion of moral faultlessness; these exemplars achieve their excellences by means of conduct that is free from any moral
aw.
â€¢ Moral saints are often used to argue for the unity of virtues thesis, namely, that the virtues work
together forming a system where each is necessary and mutually supports the others.

â€¢ Identify a moral exemplar and provide a narrative description of his or her life story.
â€¢ To get this process started, look at the list of moral exemplars provided in this module. The links in
the upper left hand corner of this module will help you to explore their accomplishments in detail. Feel
free to choose your own exemplar. Make sure you identify someone in the occupational and professional
areas such as business and engineering. These areas have more than their share of exemplars, but they
tend to escape publicity because their actions avoid publicity generating disasters rather than bring
them about.

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

1.4.4 Moral Exemplars
â€¢ 1. William LeMesseur. LeMesseur designed the Citicorp Building in New York. When a student
identied a critical design aw in the building during a routine class exercise, LeMesseur responded, not
by shooting the messenger, but by developing an intricate and eective plan for correcting the problem
before it issued in drastic real world consequences. Check out LeMesseur's prole at onlineethics and
see how he turned a potential disaster into a good deed.
â€¢ 2. Fred Cuny, starting in 1969 with Biafra, carried out a series of increasingly eective interventions
in international disasters. He brought eective methods to disaster relief such as engineering knowhow, political savvy, good business sense, and aggressive advocacy. His timely interventions saved
thousands of Kurdish refugees in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. He also helped design
and implement an innovative water ltration system in Sarajevo during the Bosnia-Serb conict in
1993. For more details, consult the biographical sketch at onlineethics.
â€¢ 3. Roger Boisjoly worked on a team responsible for developing o-ring seals for fuel tanks used in the
Challenger Shuttle. When his team noticed evidence of gas leaks he made an emergency presentation
before ocials of Morton Thiokol and NASA recommending postponing the launch scheduled for the
next day. When decision makers refused to change the launch date, Boisjoly watched in horror the next
day as the Challenger exploded seconds into its ight. Find out about the courageous stand Boisjoly
took in the aftermath of the Challenger explosion by reading the biographical sketch at onlineethics.
â€¢ 4. Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2006. His eort in setting up "micro-businesses"
funded through "micro-lending" has completely changed the paradigm on how to extend business
practices to individuals at the bottom of the pyramid. Learn about his strategies for creating microbusinesses and how those strategies have been extended throughout the world, including Latin America,
by listening to an interview with him broadcast by the Online News Hour. (See link included in this
module.)
â€¢ 5. Bill Gates has often been portrayed as a villain, especially during the anti-trust suit against Mircosoft
in the mid 1990's. Certainly his aggressive and often ruthless business practices need to be evaluated
openly and critically. But recently Gates stopped participating in the day-to-day management of
his company, Microsoft, and has set up a charitable foundation to oversee international good works
projects. Click on the link included in this module to listen to and read an interview recently conducted
with him and his wife, Melinda, on their charitable eorts.
â€¢ 6. Jerey Skilling, former CEO of Enron, can hardly be called a moral exemplar. Yet when Enron was
at its peak, its CEO, Jerey Skilling, was considered among the most innovative, creative, and brilliant
of contemporary corporate CEOs. View the documentary, The Smartest Guys in the Room, read the
book of the same title, and learn about the conguration of character traits that led to Skilling's initial
successes and ultimate failure. A link included in this module will lead you to an interview with Skilling
conducted on March 28, 2001.
â€¢ Inez Austin worked to prevent contamination from nuclear wastes produced by a plutonium production
facility. Visit Online Ethics by clicking on the link above to nd out more about her heroic stand.
â€¢ Rachael Carson's book, The Silent Spring, was one of the key events inaugurating the environmental
movement in the United States. For more on the content of her life and her own personal act of courage,

1.4.7 Textbox: Two dierent Types of Moral Exemplar
â€¢ Studies carried out by Chuck Hu into moral exemplars in computing suggest that moral exemplars
can operate as craftspersons or reformers. (Sometimes they can combine both these modes.)
â€¢ Craftspersons (1) draw on pre-existing values in computing, (2) focus on users or customers who have
needs, (3) take on the role of providers of a service/product, (4) view barriers as inert obstacles or
puzzles to be solved, and (5) believe they are eective in their role.
â€¢ Reformers (1) attempt to change organizations and their values, (2) take on the role of moral crusaders,
(3) view barriers as active opposition, and (4) believe in the necessity of systemic reform
â€¢ These descriptions of moral exemplars have been taken from a presentation by Hu at the STS colloquium at the University of Virginia on October 2006. Hu's presentation can be found at the link
provided in the upper left hand corner of this module.

Commentary: The life story interview collects the subject's life in narrative form. Those conducting
to the interview along with those studying it are skilled in identifying dierent patterns and structures
in the interview. (Identifying and classifying the patterns is called "coding".)
â€¢ Hu, Rogerson, and Barnard interviewed moral exemplars in computing in Europe and coded for the
following: social support and antagonism, the use of technical or social expertise, the description of
harm to victims or need for reform, actions taken toward reform, designs undertaken for users or clients,
eectiveness and ineectiveness of action, and negative and positive emotion (Hu and Barnard, 2009:
50).
â€¢ They identied two kinds of moral exemplars in computing: helpers (or craftspersons) and reformers.

â€¢

â€¢

Helpers and Reformers

â€¢ Craftspersons work to preserve existing values, see themselves as providers of a service, frame problems as overcoming barriers, and seek ethical ends (Hu and Barnard, 2009: 50).
â€¢ Reformers focus on social systems, see themselves as moral crusaders, work to change values, view
individuals as victims of injustice, and take system reform as their goal (Hu and Barnard, 2009: 50).

1.4.8 What Makes a Moral Exemplar? PRIMES Explained
General Comments on Exemplars

â€¢ Moral exemplars have succeeded in integrating moral and professional attitudes and beliefs into their
core identity. Going against these considerations for moral exemplars is tantamount to acting against
self. Acting in accordance with them becomes second nature.
â€¢ Moral exemplars often achieve their aims with the support of "support groups." In fact, moral exemplars
are often particularly adept at drawing support from surrounding individuals, groups and communities.
This goes against the notion that exemplars are isolated individuals who push against the current. (Not
all exemplars need t as heroes into Ayn Rand novels.)

24

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

â€¢ Moral exemplars often do not go through periods of intensive and prolonged deliberation in order to hit
upon the correct action. If we want a literary example, we need to replace the tortured deliberations
of a Hamlet with the quick and intuitive insight of an Esther Summerson. (Summerson is a character
in Charles Dickens' novel, Bleak House. See both William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens for more
examples of villains and exemplars.) Some have situated moral exemplars within virtue ethics. They
have cultivated moral habits that allow them to do good as second nature. They have also found ways
to integrate moral reasoning with emotion (as motive), perception (which helps them zero in on moral
relevance), and skill (which helps implement moral value). In this sense, moral expertise functions
much as athletic or technical expertise; all are dicult to acquire but once acquired lead to highly
skilled actions performed almost eortlessly.
PRIMES

Primes stands for Personality, Integrating value into self-system, Moral Ecology, and Moral Skills Sets.
These are the elements composing moral expertise that have been identied by Hu and Rogerson based on
interviews they conducted with exemplars in the areas of computing.
Personality

â€¢ Moral exemplars exhibit dierent congurations of personality traits based on the big ve. Locate the
moral exemplar you have chosen in terms of the following ve continuums (or continua):
â€¢ Neuroticism to Lack of Neuroticism (Stability?)
â€¢ Agreeableness to Disagreeableness
â€¢ Extraversion to Introversion
â€¢ Openness to Closedness
â€¢ Conscientiousness to Lack of Conscientiousness
â€¢ Examine your exemplar on each of these scales. In and of themselves, these qualities are neither good
nor bad. They can be integrated to form bad characters or good characters. In many cases, moral
exemplars stand out through how they have put their personality characteristics to "good use." (They
have used them as vehicles or channels to excellence.)
Integrating Moral Value into Self-System

â€¢ As said above, moral exemplars stand out by the way in which (and the extent to which) they have
integrated moral value into their self-system. Because of this, they are strongly motivated to do good
and avoid doing bad. Both (doing good and refraining from doing bad) express who they are. If they
slip into bad deeds, this motivational system pushes them to improve to avoid repeating bad deeds.
â€¢ One way of integrating moral value into self-system is by looking at stories and narratives of those
who have displayed moral excellence. Many of the individuals portrayed above (Carson, Boisjoly,
LeMesseur, Cuny, Austin, and Yunus) provide concrete models of outstanding moral careers.
â€¢ Literature also provides its models of moral exemplars. Charles Dickens paints especially powerful
portraits of both moral heroes (Esther Summerson and "Little Dorritt") and villains (Heep and Skimpole).
â€¢ Other vehicles for integrating moral value centrally into the self-system lie in aliations, relationships,
and friendships. Aristotle shows the importance of good friendships in developing virtues. Moral
exemplars most often can point to others who have served as mentors or strong positive inuences.
For example, Roger Boisjoly tells of how he once went to a senior colleague for advice on whether to
sign o on a design that was less than optimal. His colleague's advice: would you be comfortable with
your wife or child using a product based on this design?
â€¢ The ethicist, Bernard Williams, has argued forcefully for the importance of personal projects in establishing and maintaining integrity. Personal projects, roles, and life tasks all convey value; when these
hold positive moral value and become central unifying factors in one's character, then they also serve
to integrate moral value into the self system.
â€¢ Augusto Blasi, a well known moral psychologist, gives a particularly powerful account (backed by
research) of the integration of moral value into self-system and its motivational eect.

25
Moral Ecology

â€¢ Moral Ecologies: "The term moral ecology encourages us to consider the complex web of relationships
and inuences, the long persistence of some factors and the rapid evolution of others, the variations
in strength and composition over time, the micro-ecologies that can exist within larger ones, and the
multidirectional nature of causality in an ecology." From Hu et. al.
â€¢ Moral ecologies refer to social surrounds, that is, the dierent groups, organizations, and societies that
surround us and to which we are continually responding.
â€¢ We interact with these social surrounds as organisms interact with their surrounding ecosystems. In
fact, moral ecologies oer us roles (like ecological niches) and envelop us in complex organizational
systems (the way ecosystems are composed of interacting and interrelated parts). We inhabit and act
within several moral ecologies; these moral ecologies, themselves, interact. Finally, moral ecologies,
like natural ecosystems, seek internal and external harmony and balance. Internally, it is important
to coordinate dierent the constituent individuals and the roles they play. Externally, it is dicult
but equally important to coordinate and balance the conicting aims and activities of dierent moral
ecologies.
â€¢ Moral ecologies shape who we are and what we do. This is not to say that they determine us. But
they do channel and constrain us. For example, your parents have not determined who you are. But
much of what you do responds to how you have experienced them; you agree with them, refuse to
question their authority, disagree with them, and rebel against them. The range of possible responses
is considerable but these are all shaped by what you experienced from your parents in the past.
â€¢ The moral ecologies module (see the link provided above) describes three dierent moral ecologies that
are important in business: quality-, customer-, and nance-driven companies. (More "kinds" could
be generated by combining these in dierent ways: for example, one could characterize a company
as customer-driven but transforming into a quality-driven company.) Roles, strategies for dissent,
assessment of blame and praise, and other modes of conduct are shaped and constrained by the overall
character of the moral ecology.
â€¢ Moral ecologies, like selves, can also be characterized in terms of the "centrality" of moral value. Some
support the expression of moral value or certain kinds of moral value (like loyalty) while undermining
or suppressing the expression of others (like courage or autonomy).
â€¢ Finally, think in terms of how personality traits integrated around moral value interact with dierent
types of moral ecology. If a moral ecology undermines virtuous conduct, what strategies are available
for changing it? Or resisting it? If there are dierent kinds of moral exemplar, which pair best with
which moral ecology? (How would a helper or craftsperson prevail in a nance-driven moral ecology
like those characterized by Robert Jackall in Moral Mazes?
Moral Skills Sets

â€¢ Moral expertise is not reducible to knowing what constitutes good conduct and doing your best to
bring it about. Realizing good conduct, being an eective moral agent, bringing value into the work,
all require skills in addition to a "good will." PRIMES studies have uncovered four skill sets that play
a decisive role in the exercise of moral expertise.
â€¢ Moral Imagination: The ability to project into the standpoint of others and view the situation
at hand through their lenses. Moral imagination achieves a balance between becoming lost in the
perspectives of others and failing to leave one's own perspective. Adam Smith terms this balance
"proportionality" which we can achieve in empathy when we feel with them but do not become lost
in their feelings. Empathy consists of feeling with others but limiting the intensity of that feeling to
what is proper and proportionate for moral judgment.
â€¢ Moral Creativity: Moral Creativity is close to moral imagination and, in fact, overlaps with it.
But it centers in the ability to frame a situation in dierent ways. Patricia Werhane draws attention
to a lack of moral creativity in the Ford Pinto case. Key Ford directors framed the problem with
the gas tank from an economical perspective. Had they considered other framings they might have
appreciated the callousness of refusing to recall Pintos because the costs of doing so (and retrotting

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

the gas tanks) were greater than the benets (saving lives). They did not see the tragic implications
of their comparison because they only looked at the economic aspects. Multiple framings open up new
perspectives that make possible the design of non-obvious solutions.
â€¢ Reasonableness: Reasonableness balances openness to the views of others (one listens and impartially
weighs their arguments and evidence) with commitment to moral values and other important goals.
One is open but not to the extent of believing anything and failing to keep fundamental commitments.
The Ethics of Team Work module (see link above) discusses strategies for reaching consensus that are
employed by those with the skill set of reasonableness. These help avoid the pitfalls of group-based
deliberation and action.
â€¢ Perseverance: Finally, perseverance is the "ability to plan moral action and continue on that course
by responding to circumstances and obstacles while keeping ethical goals intact." Hu et. al.

1.5 Theory-Building Activities: Virtue Ethics13
Based on material presented by Chuck Hu (St. Olaf College) and William Frey at the Association for
Practical and Professional Ethics in 2005 at San Antonio, TX. Preliminary versions were distributed during
this presentation.

1.5.1 Module Introduction
This module uses materials being prepared for Good Computing: A Virtue Approach to Computer Ethics,
to set up an exercise in which you will identify and spell out virtues relevant to your professional discipline.
After identifying these virtues, you will work to contextualize them in everyday practice. Emphasis will be
placed on the Aristotelian approach to virtues which describes a virtue as the disposition toward the mean
located between the extremes of excess and defect. You will also be asked to identify common obstacles
that prevent professionals from realizing a given virtue and moral exemplars who demonstrate consistent
success in realizing these virtues and responding to obstacles that stand in the way of their realization. In a
variation on this module you could be asked to compare the virtues you have identied for your profession
with virtues that belong to other moral ecologies such as those of the Homeric warrier.

1.5.2 Three Versions of Virtue Ethics: Virtue 1, Virtue 2, and Virtue 3
Virtue ethics has gone through three historical versions. The rst, Virtue 1, was set forth by Aristotle in
ancient Greece. While tied closely to practices in ancient Greece that no longer exist today, Aristotle's
version still has a lot to say to us in this day and age. In the second half of the twentieth century, British
philosophical ethicists put forth a related but dierent theory of virtue ethics (virtue 2) as an alternative to
the dominant ethical theories of utilitarianism and deontology. Virtue 2 promised a new foundation of ethics
consistent with work going on at that time in the philosophy of mind. Proponents felt that turning from the
action to the agent promised to free ethical theory from the intractable debate between utilitarianism and
deontology and oered a way to expand scope and relevance of ethics. Virtue 3 reconnects with Aristotle
and virtue 1 even though it drops the doctrine of the mean and Aristotle's emphasis on character. Using
recent advances in moral psychology and moral pedagogy, it seeks to rework key Aristotelian concepts in
modern terms. In the following, we will provide short characterizations of each of these three versions of
virtue ethics.

1.5.3 Virtue 1: Aristotle's Virtue Ethics
â€¢ Eudaimonia. Happiness, for Aristotle, consists of a life spent fullling the intellectual and moral
virtues. These modes of action are auto-telic, that is, they are self-justifying and contain their own
ends. By carrying out the moral and intellectual virtues for a lifetime, we realize ourselves fully as
humans. Because we are doing what we were meant to do, we are happy in this special sense of
eudaimonia.
â€¢ Arete. Arete is the Greek word we usually translate as "virtue". But arete is more faithfully translated
as excellence. For Aristotle, the moral and intellectual virtues represent excellences. So the moral life
is more than just staying out of trouble. Under Aristotle, it is centered in pursuing and achieving
excellence for a lifetime.

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

â€¢ Virtue as the Mean. Aristotle also characterizes virtue as a settled disposition to choose the mean
between the extremes of excess and defect, all relative to person and situation. Courage (the virtue)
is the mean between the extremes of excess (too much courage or recklessness) and defect (too little
courage or cowardice). Aristotle's claim that most or all of the virtues can be specied as the mean
between extremes is controversial. While the doctrine of the mean is dropped in Virtue 2 and Virtue 3,
we will still use it in developing virtue tables. (See exercise 1 below.) You may not nd both extremes
for the virtues you have been assigned but make the eort nonetheless.
â€¢ Ethos. "Ethos" translates as character which, for Aristotle, composes the seat of the virtues. Virtues
are well settled dispositions or habits that have been incorporated into our characters. Because our
characters are manifested in our actions, the patterns formed by these over time reveal who we are.
This can be formulated as a decision-making test, the public identication test. Because we reveal
who we are through our actions we can ask, when considering an action, whether we would care to
be publicly identied with this action. "Would I want to be publicly known as the kind of person
who would perform that kind of action? Would I, through my cowardly action, want to be publicly
identied as a coward? Would I, through my responsible action, want to be publicly identied as a
responsible person? Because actions provide others with a window into our characters, we must make
sure be sure that they portray us as we want to be portrayed.
â€¢ Aisthesis of the Phronimos. This Greek phrase, roughly translated as the perception of the morally
experienced agent, reveals how important practice and experience are to Aristotle in his conception
of moral development. One major dierence between Aristotle and other ethicists (utilitarians and
deontologists) is the emphasis that Aristotle places on developing into or becoming a moral person.
For Aristotle, one becomes good by rst repeatedly performing good actions. So morality is more
like an acquired skill than a mechanical process. Through practice we develop sensitivities to what is
morally relevant in a situation, we learn how to structure our situations to see moral problems and
possibilities, and we develop the skill of "hitting" consistently on the mean between the extremes. All
of these are skills that are cultivated in much the same way as a basketball player develops through
practice the skill of shooting the ball through the hoop.
â€¢ Bouleusis. This word translates as "deliberation." For Aristotle, moral skill is not the product of
extensive deliberation (careful, exhaustive thinking about reasons, actions, principles, concepts, etc.)
but of practice. Those who have developed the skill to nd the mean can do so with very little thought
and eort. Virtuous individuals, for Aristotle, are surprisingly unreective. They act virtuously
without thought because it has become second nature to them.
â€¢ Akrasia. Ross translates this word as "incontinence" which is outmoded. A better translation is
weakness of will. For Aristotle, knowing where virtue lies is not the same as doing what virtue demands.
There are those who are unable to translate knowledge into resolution and then into action. Because
akrasis (weakness of will) is very real for Aristotle, he also places emphasis in his theory of moral
development on the cultivation of proper emotions to help motivate virtuous action. Later ethicists
seek to oppose emotion and right action; Aristotle sees properly trained and cultivated emotions as
strong motives to doing what virtue requires.
â€¢ Logos Aristotle's full denition of virtue is "a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a
mean, i.e. the mean relative to us, this being determined by a rational principle, and by that principle
by which [a person] of practical wisdom would determine it." (Ross's translation in Nichomachean
Ethics, 1106b, 36.) We have talked about character, the mean, and the person of practical wisdom.
The last key term is "logos" which in this denition is translated by reason. This is a good translation
if we take reason in its fullest sense so that it is not just the capacity to construct valid arguments
but also includes the practical wisdom to assess the truth of the premises used in constructing these
arguments. In this way, Aristotle expands reason beyond logic to include a fuller set of intellectual,
practical, emotional, and perceptual skills that together form a practical kind of wisdom.

1.5.4 Virtue 2
â€¢ The following summary of Virtue 2 is taken largely from Rosalind Hursthouse. While she extensively
qualies each of these theses in her own version of virtue ethics, these points comprise an excellent
summary of Virtue 2 which starts with G.E.M. Anscombe's article, "Modern Moral Philosophy," and
continues on into the present. Hursthouse presents this characterization of Virtue 2 in her book, On
Virtue Ethics (2001) U.K.: Oxford University Press: 17.
â€¢ Virtue 2 is agent centered. Contrary to deontology and utilitarianism which focus on whether
actions are good or right, V2 is agent centered in that it sees the action as an expression of the goodness
or badness of the agent. Utilitarianism focuses on actions which bring about the greatest happiness
for the greatest number; deontology seeks those actions that respect the autonomy of individuals and
carry out moral obligations, especially duties. These theories emphasize doing what is good or right.
Virtue 2, on the other hand, focuses on the agent's becoming or being good.
â€¢ Can Virtue 2 tell us how to act? Because V2 is agent-centered, critics claim that it cannot provide
insight into how to act in a given situation. All it can say is, "Act the way a moral exemplar would
act." But what moral standards do moral exemplars use or embody in their actions? And what moral
standards do we use to pick out the moral exemplars themselves? Hursthouse acknowledges that this
criticism hits home. However, she points out that the moral standards come from the moral concepts
that we apply to moral exemplars; they are individuals who act courageously, exercise justice,
and realize honesty. The moral concepts "courage," "justice," and "honesty" all have independent
content that helps guide us. She also calls this criticism unfair: while virtue 2 may not provide
any more guidance than deontology or utilitarianism, it doesn't provide any less. Virtue 2 may not
provide perfect guidance, but what it does provide is favorably comparable to what utilitarianism and
deontology provide.
â€¢ Virtue 2 replaces Deontic concepts (right, duty, obligation) with Aretaic concepts (good,
virtue). This greatly changes the scope of ethics. Deontic concepts serve to establish our minimum
obligations. On the other hand, aretaic concepts bring the pursuit of excellence within the purview of
ethics. Virtue ethics produces a change in our moral language that makes the pursuit of excellence an
essential part of moral inquiry.
â€¢ Finally, there is a somewhat dierent account of virtue 2 (call it virtue 2a) that can be attributed to
Alisdair MacIntyre. This version "historicizes" the virtues, that is, looks at how our concepts of key
virtues have changed over time. (MacIntyre argues that the concept of justice, for example, varies
greatly depending on whether one views justice in Homeric Greece, Aristotle's Greece, or Medieval
Europe.) Because he argues that skills and actions are considered virtuous only in relation to a
particular historical and community context, he redenes virtues as those skill sets necessary to realize
the goods or values around which social practices are built and maintained. This notion ts in well
with professional ethics because virtues can be derived from the habits, attitudes, and skills needed to
maintain the cardinal ideals of the profession.

1.5.5 Virtue 3
Virtue 3 can best be outlined by showing how the basic concepts of Virtue 1 can be reformulated to reect current research in moral psychology.

1. Reformulating Happiness (Eudaimonia). Mihaly Csikcszentmihalyi has described ow experiences (see text box below) in which autotelic activities play a central role. For Aristotle, the virtues
also are autotelic. They represent faculties whose exercise is key to realizing our fullest potentialities as
human beings. Thus, virtues are self-validating activities carried out for themselves as well as for the
ends they bring about. Flow experiences are also important in helping us to conceptualize the virtues
in a professional context because they represent a well practiced integration of skill, knowledge, and
moral sensitivity.

30

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

2. Reformulating Values (Into Arete or Excellence). To carry out the full project set forth by virtue
3, it is necessary to reinterpret as excellence key moral values such as honesty, justice, responsibility,
reasonableness, and integrity. For example, moral responsibility has often been described as carrying
out basic, minimal moral obligations. As an excellence, responsibility becomes refocused on extending
knowledge and power to expand our range of eective, moral action. Responsibility reformulated as
an excellence also implies a high level of care that goes well beyond what is minimally required.
3. De-emphasizing Character. The notion of character drops out to be replaced by more or less
enduring and integrated skills sets such as moral imagination, moral creativity, reasonableness, and
perseverance. Character emerges from the activities of integrating personality traits, acquired skills,
and deepening knowledge around situational demands. The unity character represents is always complex and changing.
4. Practical Skill Replaces Deliberation. Moral exemplars develop skills which, through practice,
become second nature. These skills obviate the need for extensive moral deliberation. Moral exemplars
resemble more skillful athletes who quickly develop responses to dynamic situations than Hamlets
stepping back from action for prolonged and agonizing deliberation.
5. Greater Role for Emotions. Nancy Sherman discusses how, for Aristotle, emotion is not treated
as an irrational force but as an eective tool for moral action once it has been shaped and cultivated
through proper moral education. To step beyond the controvery of what Aristotle did and did not say
about the emotions (and where he said it) we place this enhanced role for emotions within virtue 3.
Emotions carry out four essential functions: (a) they serve as modes of attention; (b) they also serve
as modes of responding to or signaling value; (c) they fulll a revelatory function; and (d) they provide
strong motives to moral action. Nancy Sherman, Making a Necessity of Virtue: Aristotle and
Kant on Virtue (1997), U.K.: Cambridge University Press: 39-50.

1.5.6 Flow Experiences
â€¢ The psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, has carried out fascinating research on what he terms "ow
experiences." Mike Martin in Meaningful Work (2000) U.K.: Oxford,: 24, summarizes these in the
following bullets:
â€¢ "clear goals as one proceeds"
â€¢ "immediate feedback about progress"
â€¢ "a balance between challenges and our skills to respond to them"
â€¢ "immersion of awareness in the activity without disruptive distractions"
â€¢ "lack of worry about failure"
â€¢ loss of anxious self-consciousness"
â€¢ time distortions (either time ying or timeslowing pleasurably)"
â€¢ the activity becomes autotelic: an end in itself, enjoyed as such"

1.5.7 Virtue Tables
The table just below provides a format for spelling out individual virtues through (1) a general description,
(2) the correlative vices of excess and defect, (3) the skills and mental states that accompany and support
it, and (4) real and ctional individuals who embody it. Following the table are hints on how to identify and
characterize virtues. We start with the virtue of integrity:

1.5.8 Exercise 1: Construct Virtue Tables for Professional Virtues
1. Discuss in your group why the virtue you have been assigned is important for the practice of your
profession. What goods or values does the consistent employment of this virtue produce?
2. Use the discussion in #1 to develop a general description of your virtue. Think along the following
lines: people who have virtue X tend to exhibit certain characteristics (or do certain things) in certain
kinds of situations. Try to think of these situations in terms of what is common and important to your
profession or practice.
3. Identify the corresponding vices. What characterizes the points of excess and defect between which
your virtue as the mean lies?
4. What obstacles arise that prevent professionals from practicing your virtue? Do well-meaning professionals lack power or technical skill? Can virtues interfere with the realization of non-moral values like
nancial values? See if you can think of a supporting scenario or case here.
5. Identify a moral exemplar for your virtue. Make use of the exemplars described in the Moral Exemplars in Business and Professional Ethics module.
6. Go back to task #2. Redene your description of your virtue in light of the subsequent tasks, especially
the moral exemplar you identied. Check for coherence.

CHAPTER 1.

ETHICAL LEADERSHIP

7. Finally, does your virtue stand alone or does it need support from other virtues or skills? For example,
integrity might also require moral courage.

1.5.9 Exercise 2: Reect on these Concluding Issues
â€¢ Did you have trouble identifying a moral exemplar? Many turn to popular gures for their moral
exemplars. Movies and ction also oer powerful models. Why do you think that it is hard to nd
moral exemplars in your profession? Is it because your profession is a den of corruption? (Probably
not.) Do we focus more on villains than on heroes? Why or why not?
â€¢ What did you think about the moral leaders portrayed in the Moral Exemplars in Business and
Professional Ethics module?
â€¢ Did you have trouble identifying both vices, i.e., vices of excess and defect? If so, do you think this
because some virtues may not have vices of excess and defect? What do you think about Aristotle's
doctrine of the mean?
â€¢ Did you notice that the virtue proles given by your group and the other groups in the class overlapped?
Is this a problem for virtue theory? Why do our conceptions of the key moral values and virtues overlap?
â€¢ Did you nd the virtues dicult to apply? What do you think about the utilitarian and deontological
criticism of virtue ethics, namely, that it cannot provide us with guidelines on how to act in dicult
situations? Should ethical theories emphasize the act or the person? Or both?
â€¢ The most tenacious obstacle to working with virtue ethics is to change focus from the morally minimal
to the morally exemplary. Virtue is the translation of the Greek word, arÃªte. But excellence is,
perhaps, a better word. Understanding virtue ethics requires seeing that virtue is concerned with the
exemplary, not the barely passable. (Again, looking at moral exemplars helps.) ArÃªte transforms
our understanding of common moral values like justice and responsibility by moving from minimally
acceptable to exemplary models.

1.5.10.3 III. Virtues and Practices
Virtues are dispositions that bring about the internal and external goods around which a social
or professional practice is built.
Constituents of a Practice

â€¢ Participants: Formed of individuals whose activities, attitudes, and goals are integrated, shared, or
overlap in signicant ways
â€¢ Rules and Procedures: Participants occupy roles which outline tasks and procedures. Roles in a
practice are coordinated so that they combine to bring about complex ends beyond the capabilities of
isolated individuals
â€¢ Boundaries: Boundaries such as disciplinary and theoretical principles surround practices and serve
to distinguish one from the other
â€¢ External Goals: Engineering serves public wellbeing. Medicine health. Law justice. Business commerce.
â€¢ Internal Goals: Engineering has the internal goals of faithful agency (to client), collegiality (to peers),
and loyalty (to the profession or practice itself)
1.5.10.4 IV. Developing Virtues for Practices

1.6 Ethical Leadership Using "Incident at Morales"17
1.6.1 Module Introduction
In this module, you will view the DVD Incident at Morales and carry out a series of activities designed to
familiarize you with issues in ethical leadership, social responsibility, and globalization. Links to interviews
with major gures on globalization, to the Connexions module "Socio Technical Systems in Decision Making"
and to online material on "Incident at Morales" will help you to gather the information you need to complete
this module.

1.6.2 Issues in Incident at Morales

â€¢ Condentiality: "Although the lawyers note that Fred has no legal obligations to Chemitoil because he
didi not sign a non-disclosure agreement, does Fred have a moral obligation to ensure the condentiality
of the information he may have learned at Chemitoil?
â€¢ Wally's "One Rule": What is the impact of Wally's "One Rule" on Fred's ability to do his job? More
importantly, does this interfere with Fred's ability to meet his professional ethical obligations in the
course of conducting his job?"
â€¢ Lutz and Lutz Controls: Wally claims that Lutz and Lutz controls are the best among the available
alternatives. He also claims that the fact that Chuck's brother-in-law works with Lutz and Lutz is
not a relevant factor. How should Fred choose in this situation regarding controls?
â€¢ Couplings: In choosing both the type of couplings and piping as well as to use a local (Mexico) supplier
without a plant inspection, what factors should Fred take into account? What should be the margin
of error in terms of pressure? How does Fred balance safety and reliability with the need to cut costs
due to the parent company's recent acquisitions?
â€¢ Environmental RegulationsWhen in Rome...: Should Fred take advantage of less strict environmental
regulations in Mexico to save money for Phaust corporation? What are the responsibilities of multinational corporations that operate in countries like Mexico?

1.6.3 Exercise 1: Incident at Moral Socio-Technical System
Prepare a socio-technical analysis of Morales, Mexico. Your analysis will examine the insertion of the Phaust
chemical plant into the Morales context. Using the following list of values, can you identify any potential
value conicts? Safety, Equity/Justice, intellectual property, condentiality, responsibility, reasonableness.
Preparing a STS Table

â€¢ Study the two templates in the module, "Socio Technical Systems in Professional Decision Making."
See which one applies best to the Incident at Morales case.
â€¢ Redo the headings of the table substituting relevant items for those in the templates that are not
relevant. For example, in preparing a STS table for a computer system, you may wish to change rate
and rate structures into something like data and data structures.
â€¢ Fill in the relevant columns in your newly revised table. For example, in the Incident at Morales,
the description of the physical surroundings would be based on the brief video segment where Fred is
consulting with Wally and Manuel. What is the geographical area like? (It looks like a dry climate
given the DVD.) What is the plant like? (It is, at the very least, small.) Attention to detaileven
trivial detailis important for these columns of the STS.
â€¢ For the second table, take the short value list we have been working with this semester and (1) look
for new value mismatches, (2) identify existing value conicts, and (3) describe any harmful long term
consequences. In Incident at Morales, you may want to concentrate on justice (equity), responsibility
for safety, respect, property, and free speech.
â€¢ Keep your tables simple and direct. You will have only a few minutes to debrief on them. Remember,
this is a device to help you visualize value conicts hidden in technologies and socio technical systems.

1.6.4 Exercise 2: Opportunities for Ethical Leadership
You will be assigned one of the topics described above. Discuss this topic with your group. Answer the
questions. The prepare a brief summary of your answers to share with the rest of the class. The topics, again,
are condentiality, Wally's "One Rule", Lutz and Lutz Controls, the quality and integrity of the couplings,
and the dierence in environmental regulations. Throughout your reections look for opportunities open
to Fred to demonstrate ethical leadership. What obstacles stand in his way? What can he do to overcome
them?
Decision Point for Business Ethics, Fall 2007

â€¢ Generate Solutions, Test Solutions, and Develop a Solution Implementation plan from the perspective
of Fred. Focus specically on whether Fred, as an engineer, should sign o on the plant as it is being
passed over to operations.
â€¢ Decision Point: Chuck's solution to the French company's budget cuts was to pass along long term
expenses and operational problems to the plant operation group.
â€¢ At the end of the video, Fred has been asked to sign o on the plant's documents and, essentially,
approve this "pass along" strategy.
â€¢ What kind of ethical problems does Chuck's solution create?
â€¢ Knowing this, should Fred have signed o on the plant at the end of the video?
â€¢ Take Fred's perspective. Generate solutions, test them, and develop an implementation from Fred's
perspective. Summarize your group's work by developing a solution table, solution evaluation matrix,
and a feasibility table. Be prepared to summarize (not present) these tables informally to the rest of
the class.

1.6.5 Exercise 3
Read and listen to the interviews with Shiva, who is opposed to globalization, and O'Rourke, who takes
a pro-globalization. Summarize their arguments. Using these arguments, construct your own argument on
globalization and apply it to the Morales case: Is the incident that occurred at Morales an inevitable result
of globalization or merely the result of bad individual and corporate decisions?

1.6.6 Incident at Morales in Ethics Bowl
Decision Scenario from "Incident at Morales" (Taken from Study Guide)

â€¢ "Although the lawyers note that Fred has no legal obligations to Chemitoil because he did not sign
a non-disclosure agreement, does Fred have a moral obligation to ensure the condentiality of the
information he may have learned at Chemitoil?
â€¢ Return to the moment where Wally gives Fred the preliminary plant plans. Then place yourself in the
following dialogue:
â€¢ WALLY Good. Chuck is going to have a project kick-o meeting this afternoon. Your plant design
will be on the agenda. It'll be at three. We don't waste time around here. We're fast at Phaust.
Corporate tag line. As Fred gazes around his new work-station, smiling, Wally starts routing through
a ling cabinet. He nds the preliminary plant plans and hands them to Fred. WALLY You might
want to look at this. (hopeful) Tell me if this is like what you were building at your last job.
â€¢ You are Fred. Is Wally asking you to violate your (moral) condentiality obligation with Chemitoil?
Present a response to Wally's question. Show how this response respects both your former employer,
Chemitoil, and your current employer, Phaust.
Decision Scenario from "Incident at Morales:" Environmental Integrity or Reliable Controls

â€¢ You are Fred. After you point out to Wally, that Lutz and Lutz controls are expensive, he advises you
to "pick your ghts when you can win them." (Chuck's brother-in-law is the customer representative for
Lutz and Lutz.) On the other hand your wife, an EPA compliance litigator, points out how dangerous
it is to put untreated toxic waste material in unlined evaporation ponds because of the possibility of
drinking water contamination.
â€¢ You think about taking Wally's advice. Which ght should you choose, saving the environment while
opting for cheaper controls or remaining with the expensive Lutz and Lutz controls but going ahead
with the unlined evaporation ponds?
â€¢ In your presentation address this broader issue. Is Wally right? Should we trade o safety and
environmental concerns when the budget is tight?

Ethical Decision-Making
2.1 Theory-Building Activities: Rights1
2.1.1 Module Introduction
Preliminary Draft distributed at APPE, 2005 in San Antonio, TX
Engineers and other professionals work in large corporations under the supervision of managers who
may lack their expertise, skills, and commitment to professional standards. This creates communication
and ethical challenges. At the very least, professionals are put in the position of having to advocate their
ethical and professional standards to those who, while not being opposed to them, may not share their
understanding of and commitment to them.
This module is designed to give you the tools and the practice using them necessary to prevail in situations
that require advocacy of ethical and professional standards. In this module you carry out several activities.
(1) You will study the philosophical and ethical foundations of modern rights theory through a brief look at
Kantian Formalism. (2) You will learn a framework for examining the legitimacy of rights claims. (3) You
will practice this framework by examining several rights claims that engineers make over their supervisors.
This examination will require that you reject certain elements, rephrase others, and generally recast the
claim to satisfy the requirments of the rights justication framework. (4) Finally, in small groups you will
build tables around your reformulation of these rights claims and present the results to the class. This
module will help you to put your results together with the rest of your classmates and collectively assemble
a toolkit consisting of the legitimate rights claims that engineers and other professionals can make over their
managers and supervisors.
For more background on rights theory and the relation of rights and duties see (1) Henry Shue, Basic
Rights: Subsistence, Auence, and U.S. Foreign Policy, 2nd edition, Princeton, 1980 and (2)
Thomas Donaldson, The Ethics of International Business, Oxford, 1989. This exercise has been used
in computer and engineering ethics classes at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez from 2002 on to
the present. It is being incorporated into the textbook, Good Computing: A Virtue Approach to Computer
Ethics by Chuck Hu, William Frey, and Jose Cruz.

Kantian Formalism, Part I: Aligning the moral motive and the moral act

â€¢ Kant's moral philosophy has exercised substantial inuence over our notions of right and duty. We
begin with a brief summary of this theory based on the work, The Foundations of the Metaphysics
of Morals.
â€¢ Kant states that the only thing in this world that is good without qualication is a good will. He
characterizes this will in terms of its motive, "duty for duty's sake."
â€¢ Consider the following example. You see a boy drowning. Even though the water is rough and the
current strong you are a good enough swimmer to save him. So while your inclination may be to give
way to fear and walk away, you are duty-bound to save the drowning boy.
â€¢ An action (saving or not saving the drowning boy) has moral worth depending on the correct correlation
of right action and right motive. The following table shows this.
Duty for Duty's Sake

Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

41
Motive = Inclination (desire for
reward or fear)

Motive = Duty

Act Conforms to Duty

You save the drowning boy for
the reward. Act conforms to duty
but is motivated by inclination.
Has no moral worth.

You save the drowning boy because it is your duty. Act conforms to duty and is for the sake
of duty. Your act has moral
worth.

Act violates a duty.

You don't save the drowning boy
because you are too lazy to jump
in. Act violates duty motivated
by inclination.

You drown trying to save the
drowning boy. He also dies. Act
fails to carry out duty but is motivated by duty anyway. The act
miscarries but since the motive is
duty it still has moral worth.

Table 2.1

Part II of Kantian Formalism: Giving content to Duty for Duty's Sake

â€¢ Kant sees morality as the expression and realization of the rational will. The rst formulation of this
rational will is to will consistently and universally.
â€¢ This leads to the Categorical Imperative: I should act only on that maxim (=personal rule
or rule that I give to myself ) that can be converted into a universal law (=a rule that
applies to everybody without self-contradiction).

â€¢ This formulation is an imperative because it commands the will of all reasonable beings. It is categorical
because it commands without exceptions or conditions. The CI tells me unconditionally not to lie. It
does not say, do not lie unless it promotes your self interest to do so.
â€¢ The following table shows how to use the Categorical Imperative to determine whether I have a duty
not to lie.
Applying the Categorical Imperative

1. Formulate your maxim (=personal rule)

Whenever I am in a dicult situation, I should tell
a lie.

2. Universalize your maxim.

Whenever anybody is in a dicult situation, he or
she should tell a lie.

3. Check for a contradiction (logical or practical)

When I lie, I will the opposite for the universal law.
Put dierently, I will that everybody (but me) be a
truth-teller and that everybody believe me a truthteller. I then make myself the exception to this
universal law. Thus my maxim (I am a liar) contradicts the law (everybody else is a truth-teller)

Table 2.2

Kantian Formalism, Part III: The Formula of the End

â€¢ When I will one thing as universal law and make myself the exeception in dicult circumstances, I am
treating others, in Kantian terms, merely as means.
â€¢ This implies that I subordinate or bend them to my interests and projects without their consent. I
do this by circumventing their autonomy through (1) force, (2) fraud (often deception), or (3) manipulation. Treating them with respect would involve telling them what I want (what are my plans and
projects) and on this basis asking them to consent to particpate and help me. The extreme case for
treating others merely as means is enslaving them.

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

â€¢ We do on occasion treat others as means (and not as mere means) when we hire them as employees.
But this is consistent with their autonomy and rational consent because we explain to them what is
expected (we give them a job description) and compensate them for their eorts. For this reason there
is a world of dierence between hiring others and enslaving them.
â€¢ The Formula of the End = Act so as to treat others (yourself included) always as ends
and never merely as means.
Some Key Denitions for a Rights Framework

â€¢ Kantian formalism provides a foundation for respect for the intrinsic value of humans as autonomous
rational beings. Using this as a point of departure, we can develop a method for identifying, spelling out,
and justifying the rights and duties that go with professionalism. This framework can be summarized
in four general propositions:
â€¢ 1. Denition: A right is an essential capacity of action that others are obliged to recognize and
respect. This denition follows from autonomy. Autonomy can be broken down into a series of specic
capacities. Rights claims arise when we identify these capacities and take social action to protect them.
Rights are inviolable and cannot be overridden even when overriding would bring about substantial
public utility.
â€¢ 2. All rights claims must satisfy three requirements. They must be (1) essential to the autonomy
of individuals and (2) vulnerable so that they require special recognition and protection (on the part
of both individuals and society). Moreover, the burden of recognizing and respecting a claim as a
right must not deprive others of something essential. In other words, it must be (3) feasible for both
individuals and social groups to recognize and respect legitimate rights claims.
â€¢ 3. Denition: A duty is a rule or principle requiring that we both recognize and respect the legitimate
rights claims of others. Duties attendant on a given right fall into three general forms: (a) duties not
to deprive, (b) duties to prevent deprivation, and (c) duties to aid the deprived.
â€¢ 4. Rights and duties are correlative; for every right there is a correlative series of duties to
recognize and respect that right.
â€¢ These four summary points together form a system of professional and occupational rights and correlative duties.
Right Claim Justication Framework

â€¢ Essential: To say that a right is essential to autonomy is to say that it highlights a capacity whose
exercise is necessary to the general exercise of autonomy. For example, autonomy is based on certain
knowledge skills. Hence, we have a right to an education to develop the knowledge required by autonomy, or we have a right to the knowledge that produces informed consent. In general, rights are
devices for recognizing certain capacities as essential to autonomy and respecting individuals in their
exercise of these capacities.
â€¢ Vulnerable: The exercise of the capacity protected under the right needs protection. Individuals
may interfere with us in our attempt to exercise our rights. Groups, corporations, and governments
might overwhelm us and prevent us from exercising our essential capacities. In short, the exercise of
the capacity requires some sort of protection. For example, an individual's privacy is vulnerable to
violation. People can gain access to our computers without our authorization and view the information
we have stored. They can even use this information to harm us in some way. The right to privacy,
thus, protects certain capacities of action that are vulnerable to interference from others. Individual
and social energy needs to be expended to protect our privacy.
â€¢ Feasible: Rights make claims over others; they imply duties that others have. These claims must not
deprive the correlative duty-holders of anything essential. In other words, my rights claims over you
are not so extensive as to deprive you of your rights. My right to life should not deprive you of your
right to self-protection were I to attack you. Thus, the scope of my right claims over you and the rest
of society are limited by your ability to reciprocate. I cannot push my claims over you to recognize
and respect my rights to the point where you are deprived of something essential.

43
Types of Duty Correlative to a Right

â€¢ Duty not to deprive: We have a basic duty not to violate the rights of others. This entails that we
must both recognize and respect these rights. For example, computing specialists have the duty not
to deprive others of their rights to privacy by hacking into private les.
â€¢ Duty to prevent deprivation: Professionals, because of their knowledge, are often in the position to
prevent others from depriving third parties of their rights. For example, a computing specialist may
nd that a client is not taking sucient pains to protect the condentiality of information about
customers. Outsiders could access this information and use it without the consent of the customers.
The computing specialist could prevent this violation of privacy by advising the client on ways to
protect this information, say, through encryption. The computing specialist is not about to violate the
customers' rights to privacy. But because of special knowledge and skill, the computing specialist may
be in a position to prevent others from violating this right.
â€¢ Duty to aid the deprived: Finally, when others have their rights violated, we have the duty to aid them
in their recovery from damages. For example, a computing specialist might have a duty to serve as
an expert witness in a lawsuit in which the plainti seeks to recover damages suered from having her
right to privacy violated. Part of this duty would include accurate, impartial, and expert testimony.
Application of Right/Duty Framework

1. We can identify and dene specic rights such as due process. Moreover, we can set forth some of the
conditions involved in recognizing and respecting this right.
2. Due Process can be justied by showing that it is essential to autonomy, vulnerable, and feasible.
3. Right holders can be specied.
4. Correlative duties and duty holders can be specied.
5. Finally, the correlative duty-levels can be specied as the duties not to violate rights, duties to prevent
rights violations (whenever feasible), and the duties to aid the deprived (whenever is feasible).

2.1.3 What you are going to do...
Exercise: Develop a Rights Table

1. You will be divided into small groups and each will be assigned a right claim taken from the above list.
2. Describe the claim (essential capacity of action) made by the right. For example, due process claims
the right to a serious organizational grievance procedure that will enable the right-holder to respond
to a decision that has an adverse impact on his or her interests. It may also be necessary in some
situations to specify the claim's necessary conditions.
3. Justify the right claim using the rights justication framework. In other words show that the right
claim is essential, vulnerable, and feasible.
4. Be sure to show that the right is essential to autonomy. If it is vulnerable be sure to identify the
standard threat. (A standard threat is an existing condition that threatens autonomy.)
5. Provide an example of a situation in which the right claim becomes active. For example, an engineer
may claim a right to due process in order to appeal what he or she considers an unfair dismissal,
transfer, or performance evaluation.
6. Identify the correlative duty-holder(s) that need to take steps to recognize and respect the right. For
example, private and government organizations may be duty-bound to create due process procedures
to recognize and respect this right.

45
7. Further spell out the right by showing what actions the correlative duties involve. For example, a
manager should not violate an employee's due process right by ring him or her without just cause.
The organization's human resources department might carry out a training program to help managers
avoid depriving employees of this right. The organization could aid the deprived by designing and
implementing binding arbitration involving an impartial third party.
Be prepared to debrief on your right claim to the rest of the class. When other groups are debrieng, you are
free to challenge them on whether their claim is essential to autonomy, whether they have identied a valid
"standard threat," and whether the correlative duties are feasible or deprive others of something essential.
Your goal as a class is to have a short but eective list of rights that professionals take with them to the
workplace.
Makes copies of your rights table and give it to the other groups in class. Be sure to make a copy for
your instructor. Together, you will build a table of rights claims that engineers and other professionals make
against managers and corporations. This will provide you a useful and comprehensive decision making tool
in that you will be able to examine decision alternatives in terms of how they stand with regard to the rights
you and your classmates and scrutinized and justied through this exercise.

2.1.4 Conclusion
Conclusion: Topics for Further Reection

â€¢ Not every claim to a right is a legitimate or justiable claim. The purpose of this framework is to get
you into the habit of thinking critically and skeptically about the rights claims that you and others
make. Every legitimate right claim is essential, vulnerable, and feasible. Correlative duties are sorted
out according to dierent levels (not to deprive, prevent deprivation, and aid the deprived); this,
in turn, is based on the capacity of the correlative duty holder to carry them out. Finally, duties
correlative to rights cannot deprive the duty-holder of something essential.
â€¢ Unless you integrate your right and its correlative duties into the context of your professional or
practical domain, it will remain abstract and irrelevant. Think about your right in the context of
the real world. Think of everyday situations in which the right and its correlative duties will arise.
Invent cases and scenarios. If you are an engineering student, think of informed consent in terms of
the public's right to understand and consent to the risks associated with engineering projects. If you
are a computing student think of what you can do with computing knowledge and skills to respect or
violate privacy rights. Don't stop with an abstract accounting of the right and its correlative duties.
â€¢ Rights and duties underlie professional codes of ethics. But this is not always obvious. For example,
the right of free and informed consent underlies much of the engineer's interaction with the public,
especially the code responsibility to hold paramount public health, safety, and welfare. Look at the
dierent stakeholder relations covered in a code of ethics. (In engineering this would include public,
client, profession, and peer.) What are the rights and duties outlined in these stakeholder relations?
How are they covered in codes of ethics?
â€¢ This module is eective in counter-acting the tendency to invent rights and use them to rationalize
dubious actions and intentions. Think of rights claims as credit backed by a promise to pay at a later
time. If you make a right claim, be ready to justify it. If someone else makes a right claim, make them
back it up with the justication framework presented in this module.

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

2.2 Three Frameworks for Ethical Problem-Solving in Business and
the Professions2
2.2.1 Module Introduction
In this module you will learn and practice three frameworks designed to integrate ethics into decision making
in the areas of practical and occupational ethics. The rst framework divides the decision making process
into four stages: problem specication, solution generation, solution testing, and solution implementation. It is based on an analogy between ethics and design problems that is detailed in a table
presented below. The second framework focuses on the process of testing solution alternatives for their
ethics by deploying three ethics tests that will help you to evaluate and rank alternative courses of action.
The reversibility, harm, and publicity tests each "encapsulate" or summarize an important ethical theory.
Finally, a feasibility test will help you to uncover interest, resource, and technical constraints that will affect and possibly impede the realization of your solution or decision. Taken together, these three frameworks
will help steer you toward designing and implementing ethical solutions to problems in the professional and
occupational areas.
Two online resources provide more extensive background information.
The rst,
www.computingcases.org, provides background information on the ethics tests, socio-technical analysis, and intermediate moral concepts. The second, http://onlineethics.org/essays/education/teaching.html,
explores in more detail the analogy between ethics and design problems. Much of this information will be
published in Good Computing: A Virtue Approach to Computer Ethics, a textbook of cases and decision
making techniques in computer ethics that is being authored by Chuck Hu, William Frey, and Jose A.
Cruz-Cruz.

2.2.2 Problem-Solving or Decision-Making Framework: Analogy between ethics
and design
Traditionally, problem-solving frameworks in professional and occupational ethics have been taken from
rational decision procedures used in economics. While these are useful, they lead one to think that ethical
decisions are already "out there" waiting to be discovered. In contrast, taking a design approach to ethical
decision making emphasizes that ethical decisions must be created, not discovered. This, in turn, emphasizes
the importance of moral imagination and moral creativity. Carolyn Whitbeck in Ethics in Engineering
Practice and Research describes this aspect of ethical decision making through the analogy she draws between
ethics and design problems in chapter one. Here she rejects the idea that ethical problems are multiple
choice problems. We solve ethical problems not by choosing between ready made solutions given with the
situation; rather we use our moral creativity and moral imagination to design these solutions. Chuck Hu
builds on this by modifying the design method used in software engineering so that it can help structure the
process of framing ethical situations and creating actions to bring these situations to a successful and ethical
conclusion. The key points in the analogy between ethical and design problems are summarized in the table
presented just below.

(1) problem specication, (2) solution generation, (3) solution testing, and (4) solution implementation.

2.2.4 Problem specication
Problem specication involves exercising moral imagination to specify the socio-technical system (including
the stakeholders) that will inuence and will be inuenced by the decision we are about to make. Stating the
problem clearly and concisely is essential to design problems; getting the problem right helps structure and
channel the process of designing and implementing the solution. There is no algorithm available to crank out
eective problem specication. Instead, we oer a series of guidelines or rules of thumb to get you started
in a process that is accomplished by the skillful exercise of moral imagination.
For a broader problem framing model see Harris, Pritchard, and Rabins, Engineering Ethics: Concepts and Cases, 2nd Edition, Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2000, pp. 30-56. See also Cynthia Brincat and
Victoria Wike, Morality and Professional Life: Values at Work, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1999.
Dierent Ways of Specifying the Problem

â€¢ Many problems can be specied as disagreements. For example, you disagree with your supervisor over
the safety of the manufacturing environment. Disagreements over facts can be resolved by gathering
more information. Disagreements over concepts (you and your supervisor have dierent ideas of what
safety means) require working toward a common denition.
â€¢ Other problems involve conicting values. You advocate installing pollution control technology because
you value environmental quality and safety. Your supervisor resists this course of action because
she values maintaining a solid prot margin. This is a conict between a moral value (safety and
environmental quality) and a nonmoral value (solid prots). Moral values can also conict with one
another in a given situation. Using John Doe lawsuits to force Internet Service Providers to reveal
the real identities of defamers certainly protects the privacy and reputations of potential targets of
defamation. But it also places restrictions on legitimate free speech by making it possible for powerful
wrongdoers to intimidate those who would publicize their wrongdoing. Here the moral values of privacy
and free speech are in conict. Value conicts can be addressed by harmonizing the conicting values,
compromising on conicting values by partially realizing them, or setting one value aside while realizing
the other (=value trade os).
â€¢ If you specify your problem as a disagreement, you need to describe the facts or concepts about which
there is disagreement.
â€¢ If you specify your problem as a conict, you need to describe the values that conict in the situation.
â€¢ One useful way of specifying a problem is to carry out a stakeholder analysis. A stakeholder is any
group or individual that has a vital interest at risk in the situation. Stakeholder interests frequently
come into conict and solving these conicts requires developing strategies to reconcile and realize the
conicting stakes.

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

â€¢ Another way of identifying and specifying problems is to carry out a socio-technical analysis. Sociotechnical systems (STS) embody values. Problems can be anticipated and prevented by specifying
possible value conicts. Integrating a new technology, procedure, or policy into a socio-technical
system can create three kinds of problem. (1) Conict between values in the technology and those in
the STS. For example, when an attempt is made to integrate an information system into the STS of a
small business, the values present in an information system can conict with those in the socio-technical
system. (Workers may feel that the new information system invades their privacy.) (2) Amplication
of existing value conicts in the STS. The introduction of a new technology may magnify an existing
value conict. Digitalizing textbooks may undermine copyrights because digital media is easy to copy
and disseminate on the Internet. (3) Harmful consequences. Introducing something new into a sociotechnical system may set in motion a chain of events that will eventually harm stakeholders in the
socio-technical system. For example, giving laptop computers to public school students may produce
long term environmental harm when careless disposal of spent laptops releases toxic materials into the
environment.

Instructions for Using Problem Classication Table

1. Is your problem a conict? Moral versus moral value? Moral versus non-moral values? Non-moral
versus non-moral values? Identify the conicting values as concisely as possible. Example: In Toysmart,
the nancial values of creditors come into conict with the privacy of individuals in the data base:
nancial versus privacy values.
2. Is your problem a disagreement? Is the disagreement over basic facts? Are these facts observable? Is
it a disagreement over a basic concept? What is the concept? Is it a factual disagreement that, upon
further reection, changes into a conceptual disagreement?
3. Does your problem arise from an impending harm? What is the harm? What is its magnitude? What
is the probability that it will occur?
4. If your problem is a value conict then can these values be fully integrated in a value integrating
solution? Or must they be partially realized in a compromise or traded o against one another?
5. If your problem is a factual disagreement, what is the procedure for gathering the required information,
if this is feasible?
6. If your problem is a conceptual disagreement, how can this be overcome? By consulting a government
policy or regulation? (OSHA on safety for example.) By consulting a theoretical account of the value
in question? (Reading a philosophical analysis of privacy.) By collecting past cases that involve the
same concept and drawing analogies and comparisons to the present case?
Moral Ecologies

â€¢ "Moral Ecology" refers to the organization in which one works. Calling this organization an "ecology"
conveys the idea that it is a system of interrelated parts. These "ecologies" dier depending on the
content of the organization's central, identity-conferring values.
â€¢ In nance-driven companies, nancial values form the core of the organization's identity. Ethical
advocacy requires skills in bringing ethical issues to the attention of decision-makers and getting them
to take these issues seriously. It helps to state ethical concerns in multi-disciplinary language. (For
example, show that ignoring ethical concerns will cost the company money in the long run.)
â€¢ Customer-driven ecologies place customer values like usability, aordability, and eciency, in the forefront of group deliberation and decision-making. Often, one must play the role of "ethics advocate"
in deliberation and decision-making. One is expected to argue forcefully and persistently ("go to the
mat") to make sure that ethical considerations are integrated into group deliberations and decisionmaking.
â€¢ Quality-driven companies place ethical values into the core of group deliberations and decision-making.
Here one is not so much ethics advocate as ethics enabler. This new role requires that one help one's
group nd creative ways of integrating ethical values with other concerns like customer and nancial
values.

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

If you are having problems specifying your problem

â€¢ Try identifying the stakeholders. Stakeholders are any group or individual with a vital interest at stake
in the situation at hand.
â€¢ Project yourself imaginatively into the perspectives of each stakeholders. How does the situation look
from their standpoint? What are their interests? How do they feel about their interests?
â€¢ Compare the results of these dierent imaginative projections. Do any stakeholder interests conict?
Do the stakeholders themselves stand in conict?
â€¢ If the answer to one or both of these questions is "yes" then this is your problem statement. How does
one reconcile conicting stakeholders or conicting stakeholder interests in this situation?
Framing Your Problem

â€¢ We miss solutions to problems because we choose to frame them in only one way.
â€¢ For example, the Mountain Terrorist Dilemma is usually framed in only one way: as a dilemma, that
is, a forced decision between two equally undesirable alternatives. (Gilbane Gold is also framed as a
dilemma: blow the whistle on Z-Corp or go along with the excess polution.)
â€¢ Framing a problem dierently opens up new horizons of solution. Your requirement from this point on
in the semester is to frame every problem you are assigned in at least two dierent ways.
â€¢ For examples of how to frame problems using socio-technical system analysis see module m14025.
â€¢ These dierent frames are summarized in the next box below.
Dierent Frames for Problems

â€¢ Technical Frame: Engineers frame problems technically, that is, they specify a problem as raising a
technical issue and requiring a technical design for its resolution. For example, in the Hughes case, a
technical frame would raise the problem of how to streamline the manufacturing and testing processes
of the chips.
â€¢ Physical Frame: In the Laminating Press case, the physical frame would raise the problem of how the
layout of the room could be changed to reduce the white powder. Would better ventilation eliminate
or mitigate the white powder problem?
â€¢ Social Frame: In the "When in Aguadilla" case, the Japanese engineer is uncomfortable working
with the Puerto Rican woman engineer because of social and cultural beliefs concerning women still
widely held by men in Japan. Framing this as a social problem would involve asking whether there
would be ways of getting the Japanese engineer to see things from the Puerto Rican point of view.
â€¢ Financial or Market-Based Frames: The DOE, in the Risk Assessment case below, accuses the
laboratory and its engineers of trying to extend the contract to make more money. The supervisor
of the head of the risk assessment team pressures the team leader to complete the risk assessment as
quickly as possible so as not to lose the contract. These two framings highlight nancial issues.
â€¢ Managerial Frame: As the leader of the Puerto Rican team in the "When in Aguadilla" case, you
need to exercise leadership in your team. The refusal of the Japanese engineer to work with a member
of your team creates a management problem. What would a good leader, a good manager, do in this
situation? What does it mean to call this a management problem? What management strategies would
help solve it?
â€¢ Legal Frame: OSHA may have clear regulations concerning the white powder produced by laminating
presses. How can you nd out about these regulations? What would be involved in complying with
them? If they cost money, how would you get this money? These are questions that arise when you
frame the Laminating Press case as a legal problem.
â€¢ Environmental Framing: Finally, viewing your problem from an environmental frame leads you to
consider the impact of your decision on the environment. Does it harm the environment? Can this
harm be avoided? Can it be mitigated? Can it be oset? (Could you replant elsewhere the trees you cut
down to build your new plant?) Could you develop a short term environmental solution to "buy time"
for designing and implementing a longer term solution? Framing your problem as an environmental
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

51
problem requires that you ask whether this solution harms the environment and whether this harming
can be avoided or remedied in some other way.

2.2.5 Solution Generation
In solution generation, agents exercise moral creativity by brainstorming to come up with solution options
designed to resolve the disagreements and value conicts identied in the problem specication stage. Brainstorming is crucial to generating nonobvious solutions to dicult, intractable problems. This process must
take place within a non-polarized environment where the members of the group respect and trust one another.
(See the module on the Ethics of Group Work for more information on how groups can be successful and
pitfalls that commonly trip up groups.) Groups eectively initiate the brainstorming process by suspending
criticism and analysis. After the process is completed (say, by meeting a quota), then participants can rene
the solutions generated by combining them, eliminating those that don't t the problem, and ranking them
in terms of their ethics and feasibility. If a problem can't be solved, perhaps it can be dissolved through
reformulation. If an entire problem can't be solve, perhaps the problem can be broken down into parts some
of which can be readily solved.
Having trouble generating solutions?

â€¢ One of the most dicult stages in problem solving is to jump start the process of brainstorming
solutions. If you are stuck then here are some generic options guaranteed to get you "unstuck."
â€¢ Gather Information: Many disagreements can be resolved by gathering more information. Because
this is the easiest and least painful way of reaching consensus, it is almost always best to start here.
Gathering information may not be possible because of dierent constraints: there may not be enough
time, the facts may be too expensive to gather, or the information required goes beyond scientic or
technical knowledge. Sometimes gathering more information does not solve the problem but allows for
a new, more fruitful formulation of the problem. Harris, Pritchard, and Rabins in Engineering Ethics:
Concepts and Cases show how solving a factual disagreement allows a more profound conceptual
disagreement to emerge.
â€¢ Nolo Contendere. Nolo Contendere is latin for not opposing or contending. Your interests may
conict with your supervisor but he or she may be too powerful to reason with or oppose. So your only
choice here is to give in to his or her interests. The problem with nolo contendere is that non-opposition
is often taken as agreement. You may need to document (e.g., through memos) that your choosing not
to oppose does not indicate agreement.
â€¢ Negotiate. Good communication and diplomatic skills may make it possible to negotiate a solution
that respects the dierent interests. Value integrative solutions are designed to integrate conicting
values. Compromises allow for partial realization of the conicting interests. (See the module, The
Ethics of Team Work, for compromise strategies such as logrolling or bridging.) Sometimes it may be
necessary to set aside one's interests for the present with the understanding that these will be taken
care of at a later time. This requires trust.
â€¢ Oppose. If nolo contendere and negotiation are not possible, then opposition may be necessary.
Opposition requires marshalling evidence to document one's position persuasively and impartially. It
makes use of strategies such as leading an "organizational charge" or "blowing the whistle." For more
on whistle-blowing consult the discussion of whistle blowing in the Hughes case that can be found at
computing cases.
â€¢ Exit. Opposition may not be possible if one lacks organizational power or documented evidence. Nolo
contendere will not suce if non-opposition implicates one in wrongdoing. Negotiation will not succeed
without a necessary basis of trust or a serious value integrative solution. As a last resort, one may
have to exit from the situation by asking for reassignment or resigning.
Rening solutions

â€¢ Are any solutions blatantly unethical or unrealizable?

52

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

â€¢ Do any solutions overlap? Can these be integrated into broader solutions?
â€¢ Can solutions be brought together as courses of action that can be pursued simultaneously?
â€¢ Go back to the problem specication? Can any solutions be eliminated because they do not address
the problem? (Or can the problem be revised to better t what, intuitively, is a good solution.)
â€¢ Can solutions be brought together as successive courses of action? For example, one solution represents
Plan A; if it does not work then another solution, Plan B, can be pursued. (You negotiate the problem
with your supervisor. If she fails to agree, then you oppose your supervisor on the grounds that her
position is wrong. If this fails, you conform or exit.)
â€¢ The goal here is to reduce the solution list to something manageable, say, a best, a
second best, and a third best. Try adding a bad solution to heighten strategic points of
comparison. The list should be short so that the remaining solutions can be intensively
examined as to their ethics and feasibility.

2.2.6 Solution Testing: The solutions developed in the second stage must be
tested in various ways.
1. Reversibility: Would I still think the choice of this option good if I were one of those adversely
aected by it? (Davis uses this formulation in various publications.) I identify dierent stakeholders
and then take up their roles. Through this imaginative projection, I should consider how the action
under consideration will aect them and how they will view, interpret, and experience this aect.
2. Harm: Does this option do less harm than any available alternative? Here I try to design an action
that will minimize harmful eects. I should factor in the likely results of the action under consideration
but I should also evaluate how justly these results will be distributed among stakeholders.
3. Publicity: What kind of person will I become if I choose this action? This is Davis' formulation of
this test as a virtue test. The key to this test is that you associate the agent with the action. If I
(the agent) am publicly judged as a person in terms of this action, what does this say about me as
a person? Am I comfortable being judged an irresponsible person on the basis of my being identied
with my irresponsible action?
4. Meta-Test - Convergence: Do a quick inventory here. Do the ethics tests come together and agree
on ranking this solution as a strong one? Then this solution satises the convergence meta-test and
this provides independent evidence of the strength of the solution.
5. Meta-Test - Divergence: Again, do a quick inventory of your solution evaluation matrix results to
this point. Do the tests dier or diverge on this point? This is independent evidence of the weakness of
this solution. Think about why this solution may be strong under one test but weak under the others.
6. The solution evaluation matrix presented just below models and summarizes the solution testing process.

2.2.7 Solution Implementation
The chosen solution must be examined in terms of how well it responds to various situational constraints
that could impede its implementation. What will be its costs? Can it be implemented within necessary time
constraints? Does it honor recognized technical limitations or does it require pushing these back through
innovation and discovery? Does it comply with legal and regulatory requirements? Finally, could the
surrounding organizational, political, and social environments give rise to obstacles to the implementation
of the solution? In general this phase requires looking at interest, technical, and resource constraints or
limitations. A Feasibility Matrix helps to guide this process.
The Feasibility Tests focuses on situational constraints. How could these hinder the implementation of
the solution? Should the solution be modied to ease implementation? Can the constraints be removed or
remodeled by negotiation, compromise, or education? Can implementation be facilitated by modifying both
the solution and changing the constraints?

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

Table 2.7

Dierent Feasibility Constraints

1. The Feasibility Test identies the constraints that could interfere with realizing a solution. This test also
sorts out these constraints into resource (time, cost, materials), interest (individuals, organizations,
legal, social, political), and technical limitations. By identifying situational constraints, problemsolvers can anticipate implementation problems and take early steps to prevent or mitigate them.
2. Time. Is there a deadline within which the solution has to be enacted? Is this deadline xed or
negotiable?
3. Financial. Are there cost constraints on implementing the ethical solution? Can these be extended
by raising more funds? Can they be extended by cutting existing costs? Can agents negotiate for more
money for implementation?
4. Technical. Technical limits constrain the ability to implement solutions. What, then, are the technical
limitations to realizing and implementing the solution? Could these be moved back by modifying the
solution or by adopting new technologies?
5. Manufacturability. Are there manufacturing constraints on the solution at hand? Given time, cost,
and technical feasibility, what are the manufacturing limits to implementing the solution? Once again,
are these limits xed or exible, rigid or negotiable?
6. Legal. How does the proposed solution stand with respect to existing laws, legal structures, and
regulations? Does it create disposal problems addressed in existing regulations? Does it respond to
and minimize the possibility of adverse legal action? Are there legal constraints that go against the
ethical values embodied in the solution? Again, are these legal constraints xed or negotiable?
7. Individual Interest Constraints. Individuals with conicting interests may oppose the implementation of the solution. For example, an insecure supervisor may oppose the solution because he fears
it will undermine his authority. Are these individual interest constraints xed or negotiable?
8. Organizational. Inconsistencies between the solution and the formal or informal rules of an organization may give rise to implementation obstacles. Implementing the solution may require support
of those higher up in the management hierarchy. The solution may conict with organization rules,
management structures, traditions, or nancial objectives. Once again, are these constraints xed or
exible?
9. Social, Cultural, or Political. The socio-technical system within which the solution is to be implemented contains certain social structures, cultural traditions, and political ideologies. How do these
stand with respect to the solution? For example, does a climate of suspicion of high technology threaten
to create political opposition to the solution? What kinds of social, cultural, or political problems could
arise? Are these xed or can they be altered through negotiation, education, or persuasion?

2.2.8 Ethics Tests For Solution Evaluation
Three ethics tests (reversibility, harm/benecence, and public identication) encapsulate three ethical approaches (deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics) and form the basis of stage three of the SDC, solution
testing. A fourth test (a value realization test) builds upon the public identication/virtue ethics test by
evaluating a solution in terms of the values it harmonizes, promotes, protects, or realizes. Finally a code test
provides an independent check on the ethics tests and also highlights intermediate moral concepts such as
safety, health, welfare, faithful agency, conict of interest, condentiality, professional integrity, collegiality,
privacy, property, free speech, and equity/access). The following section provides advice on how to use these
tests. More information can be found at www.computingcases.org.

2.2.9 Setting Up the Ethics Tests: Pitfalls to avoid
Set-Up Pitfalls: Mistakes in this area lead to the analysis becoming unfocused and getting lost in irrelevancies.
(a) Agent-switching where the analysis falls prey to irrelevancies that crop up when the test application is
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

55
not grounded in the standpoint of a single agent, (b) Sloppy action-description where the analysis fails
because no specic action has been tested, (c) Test-switching where the analysis fails because one test is
substituted for another. (For example, the public identication and reversibility tests are often reduced
to the harm/benecence test where harmful consequences are listed but not associated with the agent or
stakeholders.)
Set up the test

1. Identify the agent (the person who is going to perform the action)
2. Describe the action or solution that is being tested (what the agent is going to do or perform)
3. Identify the stakeholders (those individuals or groups who are going to be aected by the action), and
their stakes (interests, values, goods, rights, needs, etc.
4. Identify, sort out, and weigh the consequences (the results the action is likely to bring about)

2.2.10 Harm/Benecence Test
â€¢ What harms would accompany the action under consideration? Would it produce physical or mental
suering, impose nancial or non-nancial costs, or deprive others of important or essential goods?
â€¢ What benets would this action bring about? Would it increase safety, quality of life, health, security,
or other goods both moral and non-moral?
â€¢ What is the magnitude of each these consequences? Magnitude includes likelihood it will occur (probability), the severity of its impact (minor or major harm) and the range of people aected.
â€¢ Identify one or two other viable alternatives and repeat these steps for them. Some of these may be
modications of the basic action that attempt to minimize some of the likely harms. These alternatives
will establish a basis for assessing your alternative by comparing it with others.
â€¢ Decide on the basis of the test which alternative produces the best ratio of benets to harms?
â€¢ Check for inequities in the distribution of harms and benets. Do all the harms fall on one individual
(or group)? Do all of the benets fall on another? If harms and benets are inequitably distributed,
can they be redistributed? What is the impact of redistribution on the original solution imposed?
Pitfalls of the Harm/Benecence Test

1. Paralysis of Analysis" comes from considering too many consequences and not focusing only on those
relevant to your decision.
2. Incomplete Analysis results from considering too few consequences. Often it indicates a failure of moral
imagination which, in this case, is the ability to envision the consequences of each action alternative.
3. Failure to compare dierent alternatives can lead to a decision that is too limited and one-sided.
4. Failure to weigh harms against benets occurs when decision makers lack the experience to make the
qualitative comparisons required in ethical decision making.
5. Finally, justice failures result from ignoring the fairness of the distribution of harms and benets. This
leads to a solution which may maximize benets and minimize harms but still give rise to serious
injustices in the distribution of these benets and harms.

2.2.11 Reversibility Test
1. Set up the test by (i) identifying the agent, (ii) describing the action, and (iii) identifying the stakeholders and their stakes.
2. Use the stakeholder analysis to identify the relations to be reversed.
3. Reverse roles between the agent (you) and each stakeholder: put them in your place (as the agent)
and yourself in their place (as the one subjected to the action).
4. If you were in their place, would you still nd the action acceptable?

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

Cross Checks for Reversibility Test (These questions help you to check if you have carried out
the reversibility test properly.)

â€¢ Does the proposed action treat others with respect? (Does it recognize their autonomy or circumvent
it?)
â€¢ Does the action violate the rights of others? (Examples of rights: free and informed consent, privacy,
freedom of conscience, due process, property, freedom of expression)
â€¢ Would you recommend that this action become a universal rule?
â€¢ Are you, through your action, treating others merely as means?
Pitfalls of the Reversibility Test

â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢

Leaving out a key stakeholder relation
Failing to recognize and address conicts between stakeholders and their conicting stakes
Confusing treating others with respect with capitulating to their demands (Reversing with Hitler)
Failing to reach closure, i.e., an overall, global reversal assessment that takes into account all the
stakeholders the agent has reversed with.

2.2.12 Steps in Applying the Public Identication Test
â€¢ Set up the analysis by identifying the agent, describing the action, and listing the key values or virtues
at play in the situation.
â€¢ Association the action with the agent.
â€¢ Describe what the action says about the agent as a person. Does it reveal him or her as someone
associated with a virtue or a vice?

realize reasonableness or pose too much or too little reasonableness?
realize honesty or pose too much or too little honesty?
realize integrity or pose too much or too little integrity?

Pitfalls of Public Identication

â€¢ Action not associated with agent. The most common pitfall is failure to associate the agent and the
action. The action may have bad consequences and it may treat individuals with respect but these
points are not as important in the context of this test as what they imply about the agent as a person
who deliberately performs such an action.
â€¢ Failure to specify moral quality, virtue, or value. Another pitfall is to associate the action and agent
but only ascribe a vague or ambiguous moral quality to the agent. To say, for example, that willfully
harming the public is bad fails to zero in on precisely what moral quality this ascribes to the agent.
Does it render him or her unjust, irresponsible, corrupt, dishonest, or unreasonable? The virtue list
given above will help to specify this moral quality.

2.2.13 Code of Ethics Test
â€¢ Does the action hold paramount the health, safety, and welfare of the public, i.e., those aected by the
action but not able to participate in its design or execution?
â€¢ Does the action maintain faithful agency with the client by not abusing trust, avoiding conicts of
interest, and maintaining condences?
â€¢ Is the action consistent with the reputation, honor, dignity, and integrity of the profession?
â€¢ Does the action serve to maintain collegial relations with professional peers?

57

2.2.14 Meta Tests
â€¢ The ethics and feasibility tests will not always converge on the same solution. There is a complicated
answer for why this is the case but the simple version is that the tests do not always agree on a
given solution because each test (and the ethical theory it encapsulates) covers a dierent domain or
dimension of the action situation. Meta tests turn this disadvantage to your advantage by feeding the
interaction between the tests on a given solution back into the evaluation of that solution.
â€¢ When the ethics tests converge on a given solution, this convergence is a sign of the strength and
robustness of the solution and counts in its favor.
â€¢ When a given solution responds well to one test but does poorly under another, this is a sign that the
solution needs further development and revision. It is not a sign that one test is relevant while the
others are not. Divergence between test results is a sign that the solution is weak.

2.2.15 Application Exercise
You will now practice the four stages of decision making with a real world case. This case, Risk Assessment,
came from a retreat on Business, Science, and Engineering Ethics held in Puerto Rico in December 1998. It
was funded by the National Science Foundation, Grant SBR 9810253.
Risk Assessment Scenario

Case Scenario: You supervise a group of engineers working for a private laboratory with expertise in nuclear
waste disposal and risk assessment. The DOE (Department of Energy) awarded a contract to your laboratory
six years ago to do a risk assessment of various nuclear waste disposal sites. During the six years in which
your team has been doing the study, new and more accurate calculations in risk assessment have become
available. Your laboratory's study, however, began with the older, simpler calculations and cannot integrate
the newer without substantially delaying completion. You, as the leader of the team, propose a delay to the
DOE on the grounds that it is necessary to use the more advanced calculations. Your position is that the
laboratory needs more time because of the extensive calculations required; you argue that your group must
use state of the art science in doing its risk assessment. The DOE says you are using overly high standards
of risk assessment to prolong the process, extend the contract, and get more money for your company. They
want you to use simpler calculations and nish the project; if you are unwilling to do so, they plan to nd
another company that thinks dierently. Meanwhile, back at the laboratory, your supervisor (a high level
company manager) expresses to you the concern that while good science is important in an academic setting,
this is the real world and the contract with the DOE is in jeopardy. What should you do?
Part One: Problem Specication

1. Specify the problem in the above scenario. Be as concise and specic as possible
2. Is your problem best speciable as a disagreement? Between whom? Over what?
3. Can your problem be specied as a value conict? What are the values in conict? Are the moral,
nonmoral, or both?
Part Two: Solution Generation

1. Quickly and without analysis or criticism brainstorm 5 to ten solutions
2. Rene your solution list. Can solutions be eliminated? (On what basis?) Can solutions be combined?
Can solutions be combined as plan a and plan b?
3. If you specied your problem as a disagreement, how do your solutions resolve the disagreement? Can
you negotiate interests over positions? What if your plan of action doesn't work?
4. If you formulated your problem as a value conict, how do your solutions resolve this conict? By
integrating the conicting values? By partially realizing them through a value compromise? By trading
one value o for another?

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

1. Construct a solution evaluation matrix to compare two to three solution alternatives.
2. Choose a bad solution and then compare to it the two strongest solutions you have.
3. Be sure to avoid the pitfalls described above and set up each test carefully.
Part Four: Solution Implementation

1. Develop an implementation plan for your best solution. This plan should anticipate obstacles and oer
means for overcoming them.
2. Prepare a feasibility table outlining these issues using the table presented above.
3. Remember that each of these feasibility constraints is negotiable and therefore exible. If you choose
to set aside a feasibility constraint then you need to outline how you would negotiate the extension of
that constraint.

2.3.1 Introduction
In this module you will study a real world ethical problem, the Toysmart case, and employ frameworks based
on the software development cycle to (1) specify ethical and technical problems, (2) generate solutions that
integrate ethical value, (3) test these solutions, and (4) implement them over situation-based constraints.
This module will provide you with an opportunity to practice integrating ethical considerations into real
world decision-making and problem-solving in business and computing. This whole approach is based on an
analogy between ethics and design (Whitbeck).
Large real world cases like Toysmart pivot around crucial decision points. You will take on the role of
one of the participants in the Toysmart case and problem-solve in teams from one of three decision points.
Problem-solving in the real world requires perseverance, moral creativity, moral imagination, and reasonableness; one appropriates these skills through practice in dierent contexts. Designing and implementing
solutions requires identifying conicting values and interests, balancing them in creative and dynamic solutions, overcoming technical limits, and responding creatively to real world constraints.
Each decision point requires that you take up the position of a participant in the case and work through
decision-making frameworks from his or her perspective. You may be tempted to back out and adopt an
evaluative posture from which to judge the participants. Resist this temptation. This module is specically
designed to give you practice in making real world decisions. These skills emerge when you role play from
one of the standpoints within the case. You will learn that decision-making requires taking stock of one's
situation from within a clearly dened standpoint and then accepting responsibility for what arises from
within that standpoint.

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

Cases such as Toysmart are challenging because of the large amount of information gathering and sorting
they require. Moral imagination responds to this challenge by providing dierent framings that help to lter
out irrelevant data and structure what remains. Framing plays a central role in problem specication. For
example, Toysmart could be framed as the need to develop more eective software to help negotiate the
exchange of information online. In this case, a software programming expert would be brought in to improve
P3P programs. Or it could be framed as a legal problem that requires ammending the Bankruptcy Code.
What is important at this stage is that you and your group experiment with multiple framings of the case
around your decision point. This makes it possible to open up avenues of solution that would not be possible
under one framing.
Tackling large cases in small teams also helps develop the communication and collaboration skills that
are required for group work. Take time to develop strategies for dividing the work load among your team
members. The trick is to distribute equally but, at the same time, to assign tasks according the dierent
abilities of your team members. Some individuals are better at research while others excell in interviewing
or writing. Also, make sure to set aside time when you nish for integrating your work with that of your
teammates. Start by quickly reviewing the information available on the case. This is called scoping the
case. Then formulate specic questions to focus further research on information relevant to your problem
solving eorts. This includes information pertinent to constructing a socio-technical analysis, identifying key
embedded ethical issues, and uncovering existing best and worst practices.
A case narrative, STS (socio-technical system) description, and two ethical reections have been published
at http://computingcases.org. This module also links to websites on bankruptcy and privacy law, the Model
Business Corporation Act, consumer privacy information, and the TRUSTe website.
2.3.1.1 Toysmart Narrative

Toysmart was a Disney-supported company that sold educational toys online from December 1998 to May
2000. After disappointing Christmas sales in 1999, Disney withdrew its nancial support. The greatly
weakened dot-com company lasted less than a year after this. On May 22, 2000, Toysmart announced that
it was closing down and brought in a consulting rm, The Recovery Group, to evaluate its assets, including
a customer data base of 260,000 proles, each worth up to $500.
Fierce opposition emerged when Toysmart placed ads in the Wall Street Journal and the Boston
Globe to sell this data base. Customer interest groups pointed out that Toysmart had promised not to
share customer information with third parties. Toysmart also prominently displayed the TRUSTe seal which
testied further to the company's obligations to respect customer privacy and security. Selling this data to
third parties would break Toysmart promises, violate TRUSTe policies, and undermine consumer condence
in the security and privacy of online transactions. Toysmart's obligations to its customers came into direct
conict with its nancial obligations to its investors and creditors.
TRUSTe reported Toysmart's intention to sell its data base to the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) who
on July 10, 2000 led a complaint "seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the sale of condential,
personal customer information" (FTC article) Toysmart's promise never to share customer PII with third
parties provided the legal foundation for this complaint. According to the FTC, Toysmart "violated Section
5 of the FTC Act by misrepresenting to customers that personal information would never be shared with
third parties, then disclosing, selling, or oering that information for sale." Finally, because it collected data
from children under 13 who entered various contests oered on its website, Toysmart was also cited for
violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act or COPPA.
The FTC reached a settlement with Toysmart. The bankrupt dot-com must "le an order in the
bankruptcy court prohibiting the sale of its customer data as a 'stand-alone asset'. In other words, the
rights bundled in the liquidation and sale of Toysmart did not include the liberty of buyers to dispose of
the asset in whatever way they saw t. According to the negotiated settlement, buyers were bound by the
commitments and promises of the original owners. Toysmart creditors "can sell electronic assets only if the
purchasing company abided by the same privacy policy." In essence, the FTC asked Toysmart creditors to
honor the spirit, if not the letter, of Toysmart's original promise to its customers not to sell their PII to
third parties. Creditors now had to guarantee that (1) the buyer had the same basic values as Toysmart (for
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

61
example, a commitment to selling quality, educational toys), (2) the buyer use the data in the same way that
Toysmart had promised to use it when collecting it, and (3) the buyer would not transfer the information to
third parties without customer consent. In this way, the settlement proposed to protect Toysmart customer
privacy interests while allowing creditors to recover their losses through the sale of the bankrupt company's
"crown jewel", its customer data base.
On August 17, 2000, the Federal Bankruptcy Court declined to accept the Toysmart-FTC settlement.
Instead, they argued that Toysmart and the FTC should wait to see if any parties willing to buy the data
base would come forward. The Bankruptcy Court felt that potential buyers would be scared o by the FTC
suit and the pre-existing obligations created by Toysmart promises and TRUSTe standards. Should a buyer
come forth, then they would evaluate the buyer's oer in terms of the FTC-Toysmart settlement designed
to honor the privacy and security commitments made to Toysmart customers.
A nal settlement was reached on January 10, 2001. When a buyer did not come forward, Buena Vista
Toy Company, a Disney Internet subsidiary who was also a major Toysmart creditor, agreed to buy the data
base for $50,000 with the understanding that it would be immediately destroyed. The data base was then
deleted and adavits were provided to this eect.

2.3.1.4 Intermediate Moral Concept: Informed Consent
Concept and Denition

â€¢ Informed Consent: The risk bearer consents to taking on the risk on the basis of a complete understanding of its nature and breadth.
â€¢ Belmont Report: "subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose
what shall or shall not happen to them."
â€¢ "This opportunity is provided when adequate standards for informed consent are satised."
â€¢ Quotes take from Belmont Report
Arguments for Free and Informed Consent as a Moral Right

â€¢ Free and informed consent is essential for the exercise of moral autonomy. Absence implies force,
fraud, or manipulation all of which block the exercise of moral autonomy.
â€¢ The standard threat occurs when crucial risk information is not communicated to risk taker. This
could be because the risk taker cannot appreciate the risk, because the mode of communication is
inadequate, or because the information has been covered up. Given this standard threat, free and
informed consent is vulnerable; it must be protected.
â€¢ Informed consent must be shaped around its feasibility, that is, the ability of the duty holder to
recognize and respect this right in others. If private individuals exercise their right as a veto, then they
can block socially benecial projects. There are also serious problems concerning children, mentally
challenged adults, and future generations. Finally, it may not be possible or feasible to know all risks
in advance.
Conditions for Recognizing and Respecting Right

â€¢ From Belmont Report
â€¢ Information: research procedure, their purposes, risks and anticipated benets, alternative procedures
(where therapy is involved), and a statement oering the subject the opportunity to ask questions and
to withdraw at any time from the research.
â€¢ Comprehension: manner and context in which information is conveyed is as important as the information itself.
â€¢ Voluntariness: an agreement to participate in research constitutes a valid consent only if voluntarily
given. This element of informed consent requires conditions free of coercion and undue inuence.
Other Legal and Moral Frameworks

â€¢ Institutional Research Boards or IRBs now require documentation of informed consent on research
projects carried out under the university's auspicies. This is in response to requirements by granting
agencies such as the National Institute for Health and the National Science Foundation.
â€¢ Consenting to the transfer of PII (personal identifying information) online:opt-in and optout.
â€¢ Opt-in: Information is transferred only upon obtaining express consent. Default is not transferring
information.
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

65

â€¢ Opt-in: Information transfer is halted only when person to whom information applies does something
positive, i.e., refuses to consent to transfer. Default is on transferring the information.
â€¢ Liability Rules and Property Rules: These also have to do with consent. Sago makes this
distinction with reference to activities that have an impact on the environment. an injunction referring
to liability rules stops the activity to protect the individual who proves impact. Property rules require
only that the producer of the environmental impact compensate the one who suers the impact.
Cases Employing Informed Consent

â€¢ Therac-25: Patients receiving radiation therapy should be made aware of the risks involved with
treatment by the machine. Free and informed consent is involved when shutting down the machines to
investigate accident reports or continuing operating the machines while investigating accident reports.
In both cases, it is necessary, under this right, to let patients know what is going on and their risks.
â€¢ Toysmart Case: Toysmart creditors are about to violate Toysmart's promise not to transfer customer
information proles to third parties. This transfer can occur, morally, but only with the express consent
of the customers who have provided the information. The devil is in the details. Do opt-in or opt-out
procedures best recognize and respect free and informed consent in this case?
â€¢ Hughes Case: Hughes customers want their chips right away and are pressuring Saia and crowd to
deliver them. Would they consent to renegotiating the conditions under which environmental tests can
be skipped?

The triangle of privacy is widely disseminated in the literature of business ethics. The author rst became
aware of it form George G Brenkert (1981) "Privacy, Polygraphs and Work," Business and Professional
Ethics 1, Fall 1981" 19-34. Information on intellectual property comes from Lawrence Lessig (2006) Code.2,
Basic Books: Chapter 10.

2.3.3 What you need to know . . .
2.3.3.1 What you need to know about socio-technical systems
1. STS have seven broad components: hardware, software, physical surroundings, people/groups/roles, procedures, laws, and data/data structures.
2. Socio-technical systems embody values

â€¢ These include moral values like safety, privacy, property, free speech, equity and access, and security.
Non-moral values can also be realized in and through Socio Technical Systems such as eciency, costeectiveness, control, sustainability, reliability, and stability.

68

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

â€¢ Moral values present in Socio Technical Systems can conict with other embedded moral values; for
example, privacy often conicts with free speech. Non-moral values can conict with moral values;
developing a safe system requires time and money. And, non-moral values can conict; reliability
undermines eciency and cost eectiveness. This leads to three problems that come from dierent
value conicts within Socio Technical Systems and between these systems and the technologies that
are being integrated into them.
â€¢ Mismatches often arise between the values embedded in technologies and the Socio Technical Systems into which they are being integrated. As UNIX was integrated into the University of California
Academic Computing STS (see Machado case at Computing Cases), the values of openness and transparency designed into UNIX clashed with the needs of students in the Academic Computing STS at
UCI for privacy.
â€¢ Technologies being integrated into Socio Technical Systems can magnify, exaggerate, or exacerbate
existing value mismatches in the STS. The use of P2P software combined with the ease of digital
copying has magnied existing conicts concerning music and picture copyrights.
â€¢ Integrating technologies into STSs produces both immediate and remote consequences and impacts.
3. Socio-technical systems change

â€¢ These changes are bought about, in part, by the value mismatches described above. At other times,
they result from competing needs and interests brought forth by dierent stakeholders. For example,
bicycle designs, the conguration of typewriter keys, and the design and uses of cellular phones have
changed as dierent users have adapted these technologies to their special requirements.
â€¢ These changes also exhibit what sociologists call a trajectory, that is, a path of development. Trajectories themselves are subject to normative analysis. For example, some STSs and the technologies
integrated into them display a line of development where the STS and the integrated technology are
changed and redesigned to support certain social interests. The informating capacities of computing
systems, for example, provide information which can be used to improve a manufacturing processes
can or to monitor workers for enhancing management power. (See Shoshanna Zubo, The Age of
the Smart Machine

â€¢ Trajectories, thus, outline the development of STSs and technologies as these are inuenced by internal
and external social forces.
In this section, you will learn about this module's exercises. The required links above provide information on
the frameworks used in each section. For example, the Socio-Technical System module provides background
information on socio-technical analysis. The "Three Frameworks" module provides a further description of
the ethics tests, their pitfalls, and the feasibility test. These exercises will provide step by step instructions
on how to work through the decision points presented above.
For more information see Hu and Jawer below.
Decision Point One:

You are David Lord, a former employee of Holt Educational Outlet, a manufacturer of educational toys
located in Waltham, Mass. Recently, you have joined with Stan Fung of Zero Stage Capital, a venture
capital rm to buy out Holt Educational Outline. After changing its name to Toysmart, you and Fung
plan to transform this brick and mortar manufacturer of educational toys into an online rm that will link
customers to a vast catalogue of educational, high quality toys. Designing a website to draw in toy customers,
linking to information on available toys, setting up a toy distribution and shipping system, and implementing
features that allow for safe and secure online toy purchases will require considerable nancing. But, riding
the crest of the dot-com boom, you have two promising options. First, a venture capital rm has oered
you $20,000,000 for website development, publicity, and other services. Second, Disney has oered the same
amount for nancing, but has added to it an additional $25,000,000 in advertising support. Disney has a
formidable reputation in this market, a reputation which you can use to trampoline Toysmart into prominence
in the growing market in educational toys. However, Disney also has a reputation of micro-managing its
partners. Develop a plan for nancing your new dot-com.
Things to consider in your decision-making:

Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

69
1. What are Toysmart values? What are Disney values? Would Disney respect Toysmart's values?
2. What synergies could result from working with Disney? For example, could you share information on
customers? You could feed your customer proles to Disney in exchange for their customer proles.
What kind of data managing technology would be required for this? What ethical problems could arise
from transferring customer identifying information to third parties?
3. What kind of commitment would you be willing to make to Disney in terms of product and sales? How
should Disney reciprocate? For example, how long should they stick with you through sales that fall
short of projections?
Decision Point Two:

You work for Blackstone, "an 18-person software business." You have been asked by Toysmart to provide
software the following functions: (1) designing a webpage that would attract customers and communicate
Toysmart Values, (2) advise Toysmart on its privacy and data security policy including whether to register
with an online trust, security measures to protect customer data during online transactions, and measures
to prevent unauthorized access to customer data while stored, and (3) a comprehensive online catalogue
that would provide customers with access to educational toys from a variety of small busines manufacturers.
An example of small toy manufacturers to which Toysmart should be linked is Brio Corporation which
manufactures wooden toys such as blocks, trains, and trucks. Develop general recommendations for Toysmart
around these three areas.
Information for this scenario comes from Laura Lorek,
"When Toysmart Broke,"
http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,1101,2612962,00.html. Accessed July 16, 2001.
Things to consider in your decision-making

â€¢ Toysmart is a fairly new dot-com. While it is supported by Disney, it is still a risky venture. Should
you ask them for advance payment for whatever services you render? What kind of policies does your
company have for identifying and assessing nancial risk?
â€¢ What kind of privacy and data security policy should you recommend to Toysmart? What kind of
values come into conict when a company like Toysmart develops and implements privacy and data
security measures? (Use your STS description to answer this question.)
â€¢ Should Toysmart become bankrupt, their data base would turn into a valuable asset. What recommendations should you make to help Toysmart plan around this possibility? What values come into
conict when planning to dispose of assets during bankruptcy proceedings? What kind of obligations
does a company take on during its operation that continue even after it has become bankrupt?
â€¢ Using the link provided with this module, visit the TRUSTe website and nd its white paper on
developing a privacy policy. Evaluate this privacy policy for Toysmart. What benets can a strong
privacy policy bring to a dot-com? Should Toysmart work to qualify to display the TRUSTe seal on
its website? Examine TRUSTe procedures for transferring condential customer PII to third parties?
What obligations will this create? Would this over-constrain Toysmart?
Decision Point Three:

You work for PAN Communications and have been providing advertising services for Toysmart. Now you
nd out that Toysmart has led a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and it has an outstanding debt to your company
for $171,390. As a part of this ling procedure, Toysmart has reported its assets at $10,500,000 with
debts of $29,000,000. Toysmart creditors, including PAN Communications, have petitioned the Oce of the
United States Trustee for a "Creditors' Committee Solicitation Form." This will allow for the formation of
a committee composed of Toysmart creditors who decide on how the assets of the bankrupt rm will be
distributed. You, because of your knowledge of bankruptcy and accounting procedures, have been asked
to represent your company on this committee. This bleak situation is somewhat remedied by the customer
data base that Toysmart compiled during its operation. It contains proles of the PII (personal identifying
information) of 260,000 individuals. Because selling educational toys is protable, there is a good chance
that this data base could be sold for up to $500 a prole to a third party. Should you recommend selling
this data base? Should Toysmart customers be notied of the pending transfer of their PII and, if so, how
should they be notied?

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

Here are some constraints that outline your decision

â€¢ As a member of the Creditors' Committee, you have a duciary duty to Toysmart creditors in working to distribute fairly the remaining Toysmart assets. This would, all things being equal, lead to
recommending selling the Toysmart customer data base
â€¢ There are some provisions in the bankruptcy code that may require or allow overriding duciary duties
given prior legal commitments made by Toysmart. These commitments, in the form of strong privacy
guarantees made to customers by Toysmart on its webpage, may constitute an "executory contract."
See the Legal Trail table in the Toysmart case narrative and also Larren M. Nashelsky, "On-Line
Privacy Collides With Bankruptcy Creditors," New York Law Journal, New York Law Publishing
Company, August 28, 2000.
â€¢ Finally, Nashelsky makes an interesting argument. While deontological considerations would require
setting aside creditor interests and honoring Toysmart privacy promises, a justice-based argument
would recommend a compromise. Bankruptcy proceedings start from the fact that harm (nancial)
has been done. Consequently, the important justice consideration is to distribute fairly the harms
involved among the harmed parties. Harm distributions are correlated with benet distributions.
Because Toysmart customers beneted from Toysmart oerings, they should also bear a share of the
harms produced when the company goes bankrupt. This requires that they allow the distribution of
their PII under certain conditions.
Things to consider in your decision-making

â€¢ How do you balance your obligations to PAN with those to other Toysmart creditors as a member of
the Creditors' Committee?
â€¢ How should you approach the conict between honoring Toysmart promises and carrying out Creditor
Committee duciary duties? Do you agree with Nashelsky's argument characterized above?
â€¢ Should the Bankruptcy Code be changed to reect issues such as these? Should privacy promises
be considered an executory contract that overrides the duty to fairly and exhaustively distribute a
company's assets?
â€¢ Finally, what do you think about the FTC's recommendation? The Bankruptcy Court's response?
The nal accommodation between Toysmart and Buena Vista Toy Company?

2.3.4 What you will do ...
In this section, you will learn about this module's exercises. The required links above provide information on
the frameworks used in each section. For example, the Socio-Technical System module provides background
information on socio-technical analysis. The "Three Frameworks" module provides a further description of
the ethics tests, their pitfalls, and the feasibility test. These exercises will provide step by step instructions
on how to work through the decision points presented above.

2.3.5 Exercise One: Problem Specication
In this exercise, you will specify the problem using socio-technical analysis. The STS section of the Toysmart
Case narrative (found at Computing Cases) provides a good starting point. In the rst table, enter the
information from the Toysmart case materials pertinent to the general components of a STS, its hardware,
software, physical surroundings, people/groups/roles, procedures, laws, data. Some examples taken from
the STS description at Computing Cases are provided to get you started. Then, using the second table,
identify the values that are embedded in the dierent components of the STS. For example, PICS (platforms
for internet content selection) embody the values of security and privacy. Finally, using the data from your
socio-technical analysis, formulate a concise problem statement.

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

Exercise 1c:

Write out the requirements (ethical and practical) for a good solution. Identify the parts of the STS that
need changing. Then, develop a concise summary statement of the central problem your decision point
raises. As you design solutions to this problem, you may want to revise this problem statement. Be sure to
experiment with dierent ways of framing this problem.
Harris, Pritchard, and Rabins provide a useful approach to problem specication. See references below.

2.3.6 Exercise Two: Solution Generation
Generate solutions to the problem(s) you have specied in Exercise 1. This requires that...

â€¢ each member of your group develop a list of solutions,
â€¢ the group combines these individual lists into a group list, and...
â€¢ the group reduces this preliminary list to a manageable number of rened and claried solutions for
testing in the next stage.
Helpful Hints for Solution Generation
1. Solution generation requires prociency in the skills of moral imagination and moral creativity.

Moral imagination is the ability to open up avenues of solution by framing a problem in dierent ways.
Toysmart could be framed as a technical problem requiring problem-solving skills that integrate ethical
considerations into innovative designs. Moral creativity is the ability to formulate non-obvious solutions
that integrate ethical considerations over various situational constraints.
2. Problems can be formulated as interest conicts. In this case dierent solution options are
available.

â€¢ Gather Information. Many disagreements can be resolved by gathering more information. Because
this is the easiest and least painful way of reaching consensus, it is almost always best to start here.
Gathering information may not be possible because of dierent constraints: there may not be enough
time, the facts may be too expensive to gather, or the information required goes beyond scientic or
technical knowledge. Sometimes gathering more information does not solve the problem but allows for
a new, more fruitful formulation of the problem. Harris, Pritchard, and Rabins in Engineering Ethics:
Concepts and Cases show how solving a factual disagreement allows a more profound conceptual
disagreement to emerge.
â€¢ Nolo Contendere. Nolo Contendere is latin for not opposing or contending. Your interests may
conict with your supervisor but he or she may be too powerful to reason with or oppose. So your only
choice here is to give in to his or her interests. The problem with nolo contendere is that non-opposition
is often taken as agreement. You may need to document (e.g., through memos) that you disagree with
a course of action and that your choosing not to oppose does not indicate agreement.
â€¢ Negotiate. Good communication and diplomatic skills may make it possible to negotiate a solution
that respects the dierent interests. Value integrative solutions are designed to integrate conicting
values. Compromises allow for partial realization of the conicting interests. (See the module, The
Ethics of Team Work, for compromise strategies such as logrolling or bridging.) Sometimes it may
be necessary to set aside one's interests for the present with the understanding that these will be taken
care of at a later time. This requires trust.
â€¢ Oppose. If nolo contendere and negotiation are not possible, then opposition may be necessary.
Opposition requires marshalling evidence to document one's position persuasively and impartially. It
makes use of strategies such as leading an "organizational charge" or "blowing the whistle." For more
on whistle-blowing consult the discussion of whistle blowing in the Hughes case that can be found at
computing cases.

75

â€¢ Exit. Opposition may not be possible if one lacks organizational power or documented evidence. Nolo
contendere will not suce if non-opposition implicates one in wrongdoing. Negotiation will not succeed
without a necessary basis of trust or a serious value integrative solution. As a last resort, one may
have to exit from the situation by asking for reassignment or resigning.
3. Solutions can be generated by readjusting dierent components of the STS.

â€¢ Technical Puzzle. If the problem is framed as a technical puzzle, then solutions would revolve around
developing designs that optimize both ethical and technical specications, that is, resolve the technical
issues and realize ethical value. In this instance, the problem-solver must concentrate on the hardware
and software components of the STS.
â€¢ Social Problem. If the problem is framed as a social problem, then solutions would revolve around
changing laws or bringing about systemic reform through political action. This would lead one to focus
on the people/groups/roles component (working to social practices) or the legal component.
â€¢ Stakeholder Conict. If the problem is framed as a conict between dierent stakeholder interests,
then the solution would concentrate on getting stakeholders (both individuals and groups) to agree on
integrative or interest compromising solutions. This requires concentrating on the people/group/role
component of the STS. (Note: A stakeholder is any group or individual with a vital interest at play in
the situation.)
â€¢ Management Problem. Finally, if the problem is framed as a management problem, then the
solution would revolve around changing an organization's procedures. Along these lines, it would
address the (1) fundamental goals, (2) decision recognition procedures, (3) organizational roles, or (4)
decision-making hierarchy of the organization. These are the four components of the CID (corporate
internal decision) structure described in the Ethical Reections section of the Toysmart case.
â€¢ Nota Bene: Financial issues are covered by the feasibility test in the solution implementation stage.
As such, they pose side issues or constraints that do not enter into the solution generation phase but
the solution implementation phase.
4. Brainstorming. Moral creativity, which involves designing non-obvious solutions, forms an
essential part of solution generation. Here are some guidelines to get you started.

â€¢ Individually make out a list of solutions before the group meeting. Work quickly to realize a preestablished quota of ve to ten solutions. After composing a quick rst draft, revise the list for clarity
only; make no substantial changes.
â€¢ Start the group brainstorming process by having the group review and assemble all the individual
solutions. Do this quickly and without criticism. Beginning criticism at this stage will kill the creativity
necessary for brainstorming and shut down the more timid (but creative) members of the group.
â€¢ Review the list and identify solutions that are identical or overlap. Begin the rening process by
combining these solutions.
â€¢ Having reviewed all the brainstormed solutions, it is now time to bring in criticism. Begin by eliminating
solutions with major ethical problems such as those that violate rights, produce injustices, or cause
extensive harm.
â€¢ Identify but do not eliminate solutions that are ethical but raise serious practical problems. Do not
initially eliminate an ethical solution because there are obstacles standing in the way of its implementation. Be descriptive. Identify and impartially describe the obstacles. Later, in the solution
implementation stage, you may be able to design creative responses to these obstacles.
â€¢ Identify solutions that do not "t" your problem statement. These require a decision. You can throw
out the solution because it does not solve the problem or you can change the problem. If a solution
does not t the problem but, intuitively, seems good, this is a sign that you need to take another look
at your problem statement.
â€¢ Don't automatically reject partial solutions. For example, sending memos through email rather than
printing them out and wasting paper may not solve the entire recycling problem for your company.

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

But it represents a good, partial solution that can be combined with other partial solutions to address
the bigger problem.
â€¢ Through these dierent measures, you will gradually integrate criticism into your brainstorming process. This will facilitate working toward a manageable, rened list of solutions for testing in the next
stage.
Exercise 3: Develop a Solution List

â€¢ Have each member of your team prepare a solution list and bring it to the next group meeting. Set a
quota for this individual list, say, 5 to 10 solutions.
â€¢ Prepare a group list out of the lists of the individual members. Work to combine similar solutions. Be
sure to set aside criticism until the preliminary group list is complete.
â€¢ Make use of the following table.
â€¢ Rene the group list into a manageable number of solutions for testing in the next stage. Combine
overlapping solutions. Eliminate solutions that do not respond to the requirements and the problem
statement that you prepared in the previous exercise. Eliminate solutions that violate important ethical
considerations, i.e., solutions that violate rights, produce harms, etc.
â€¢ Check your rened solution list with your problem statement. If they do not match, eliminate the
solution or redene the problem

2.3.7 Exercise Three: Solution Testing
In this section, you will test the solutions on the rened list your group produced in the previous exercise.
Three ethics tests, described below, will help you to integrate ethical considerations in the problem-solving
process. A global feasibility test will help to identify solutions with serious practical problems. Finally, a
Solution Evaluation Matrix summarizes the results for class debriengs.
Setting up for the test.

â€¢ Identify the agent perspective from which the decision will be made
â€¢ Describe the action as concisely and clearly as possible.
â€¢ Identify the stakeholders surrounding the decision, i.e., those who will suer strong impacts (positively
or negatively) from the implementation of your decision. Stakeholders have a vital or essential interest
(right, good, money, etc) in play with this decision.
â€¢ In the harm/benecence test, identify the likely results of the action and sort these into harms and
benets.
â€¢ For the reversibility test, identify the stakeholders with whom you will reverse positions.
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

77

â€¢ For the public identication test, identify the values, virtues, or vices your action embodies. Associate
these with the character of the agent.
Harm/Benecence Test

1. What are the harms your solution is likely to produce? What are its benets? Does this
2.

solution produce the least harms and the most benets when compared to the available
alternatives?
PitfallToo much. In this "Paralysis of Analysis" one factor in too many consequences. To avoid

the fallacy restrict the analysis to the most likely consequences with the greatest magnitude (Magnitude
indicates the range and severity of impact).
3. PitfallToo Little. A biased or incomplete analysis results when signicant impacts are overlooked.
Take time to uncover all the signicant impacts, both in terms of likelihood and in terms of magnitude.
4. PitfallDistribution of Impacts. Consider, not only the overall balance of harms and benets
but also how harms and benets are distributed among the stakeholders. If they are equally or fairly
distributed, then this counts in the solution's favor. If they are unequally or unfairly distributed,
then this counts against the solution. Be ready to redesign the solution to distribute better (=more
equitably or fairly) the harmful and benecial results.
Reversibility Test

1. Would this solution alternative be acceptable to those who stand to be most aected by

it? To answer this question, change places with those who are targeted by the action and
ask if from this new perspective whether the action is still acceptable?
PitfallToo much. When reversing with Hitler, a moral action appears immoral and an immoral

action appears moral. The problem here is that the agent who projects into the immoral standpoint
loses his or her moral bearings. The reversibility test requires viewing the action from the standpoint
of its dierent targets. But understanding the action from dierent stakeholder views does not require
that one abandon himself or herself to these views.
PitfallToo little. In this pitfall, moral imagination falls short, and the agent fails to view the
action from another stakeholder standpoint. The key in the reversibility test is to nd the middle
ground between too much immersion in the viewpoint of another and too little.
PitfallReducing Reversibility to Harm/Benecence. The reversibility test requires that one
assess the impacts of the action under consideration on others. But it is more than a simple listing of
the consequences of the action. These are viewed from the standpoint of dierent stakeholders. The
reversibility test also goes beyond considering impacts to considering whether the action treats dierent
stakeholders respectfully. This especially holds when the agent disagrees with a stakeholder. In these
disagreements, it is important to work out what it means to disagree with another respectfully.
PitfallIncomplete survey of stakeholders. Leaving out signicant stakeholder perspectives
skews the results of the reversibility test. Building an excellent death chamber works when one considers
the action from the standpoint of Hitler; after all, it's what he wants. But treating an individual with
respect does not require capitulating to his or her desires, especially when these are immoral. And
considering the action from the standpoint of other stakeholders (say the possible victims of newer,
more ecient gas chambers) brings out new and radically dierent information.
PitfallNot Weighing and Balancing Stakeholder Positions. This pitfall is continuous with the
previous one. Dierent stakeholders have dierent interests and view events from unique perspectives.
The reversibility test requires reviewing these interests and perspectives, weighing them against one
another, and balancing out their dierences and conicts in an overall, global assessment.

Publicity (or Public Identication) Test

1. Would you want to be publicly associated or identied with this action? In other words,
assume that you will be judged as a person by others in terms of the moral values

78

CHAPTER 2.

2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

expressed in the action under consideration. Does this accord with how you would want
to or aspire to be judged?
PitfallFailure to association action with character of agent. In the publicity test, the

spotlight of analysis moves from the action to the agent. Successfully carrying out this test requires
identifying the agent, describing the action, and associating the agent with the action. The moral
qualities exhibited in the action are seen as expressing the moral character of the agent. The publicity
test, thus, rests on the idea that an agent's responsible actions arise from and express his or her
character.
3. PitfallFailure to appreciate the moral color of the action. The publicity test assumes that
actions are colored by the ends or goods they pursue. This means that actions are morally colored. They
can express responsibility or irresponsibility, courage or cowardice, reasonableness or unreasonableness,
honesty or dishonesty, integrity or corrpution, loyalty or betrayal, and so forth. An analysis can go
astray by failing to bring out the moral quality (or qualities) that an action expresses.
4. PitfallReducing Publicity to Harm/Benecence Test. Instead of asking what the action says
about the agent, many reduce this test to considering the consequences of publicizing the action. So
one might argue that an action is wrong because it damages the reputation of the agent or some other
stakeholder. But this doesn't go deep enough. The publicity test requires, not that one calculate the
consequences of wide-spread knowledge of the action under consideration, but that one draws from the
action the information it reveals about the character of the agent. The consequences of bad publicity
are covered by the harm/benecence test and do not need to be repeated in the public identication
test. The publicity test provides new information by turning from the action to the agent. It focuses
on what the action (its moral qualities and the goods it seeks) says about the agent.
Comparing the Test Results: Meta-Tests

1. The ethics tests will not always converge on the same solution because each test (and the ethical
theories it encapsulates) covers a dierent dimension of the action: (1) harm/benecence looks at the
outcomes or consequences of the action, (2) reversibility focuses on the formal characteristics of the
action, and (3) publicity zeros in on the moral character of the agent.
2. The meta-tests turn this surface disagreement into an advantage. The convergence or divergence
between the ethics tests become indicators of solution strength and weakness.
3. Convergence. When the ethics tests converge on a given solution, this indicates solution strength
and robustness.
4. Divergence. When tests diverge on a solutiona solution does well under one test but poorly under
anotherthis signies that it needs further development and revision. Test divergence is not a sign
that one test is relevant while the others are not. Divergence indicates solution weakness and is a call
to modify the solution to make it stronger.
Exercise 3: Summarize your results in a Solution Evaluation Matrix

1. Place test results in the appropriate cell.
2. Add a verbal explanation to the SEM table.
3. Conclude with a global feasibility test that asks, simply, whether or not there exist signicant obstacles
to the implementation of the solution in the real world.
4. Finish by looking at how the tests converge on a given solution. Convergence indicates solution strength;
divergence signals solution weakness.

2.3.8 Exercise Four: Solution Implementation
In this section, you will trouble-shoot the solution implementation process by uncovering and defusing
potential obstacles. These can be identied by looking at the constraints that border the action. Although
constraints specify limits to what can be realized in a given situation, they are more exible than generally
thought. Promptly identifying these constraints allows for proactive planning that can push back obstacles
to solution implementation and allow for realization of at least some of the value embodied in the solution.
A Feasibility Test focuses on these situational constraints and poses useful questions early on in the
implementation process. What conditions could arise that would hinder the implementation of a solution?
Should the solution be modied to ease implementation under these constraints? Can the constraints be
removed or modied through activities such as negotiation, compromise, or education? Can solution implementation be facilitated by modifying both the solution and the constraints?

CHAPTER 2.

ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING

â€¢ Resource. Are necessary resources available? Is it necessary to plan ahead to identify and procure
resources? If key resources are not available, is it possible to substitute other, more available resources?
Would any signicant moral or non-moral value be lost in this substitution?
Interest Constraints

â€¢ Does the solution threaten stakeholder interests? Could it be perceived as so threatening
to a stakeholder's interests that the stakeholder would oppose its implementation?

â€¢ Individual Interests. Does the solution threaten the interests of supervisors? Would they take
measures to block its realization? For example, a supervisor might perceive the solution as undermining
his or her authority. Or, conicting sub-group interests could generate opposition to the implementation
of the solution even though it would promote broader organizational objectives.
â€¢ Organizational Interests. Does the solution go against an organization's SOPs (standard operating
procedures), formal objectives, or informal objectives? Could acting on this solution disrupt organization power structures? (Perhaps it is necessary to enlist the support of an individual higher up in
the organizational hierarchy in order to realize a solution that threatens a supervisor or a powerful
sub-group.)
â€¢ Legal Interests. Are there laws, statutes, regulations, or common law traditions that oppose the
implementation of the solution? Is it necessary to write an impact statement, develop a legal compliance
plan, or receive regulatory approval in order to implement the solution?
â€¢ Political/Social/Historical Constraints. Would the solution threaten or appear to threaten the
status of a political party? Could it generate social opposition by threatening or appearing to threaten
the interests of a public action group such as an environmental group? Are there historical traditions
that conict with the values embedded in the solution?
Technical Constraints

â€¢ Technology does not yet exist. Would the implementation of the solution require breaking new
technological ground?
â€¢ Technology Protected by Patent. The technology exists but is inaccessible because it is still under
a patent held by a competitor.
â€¢ Technology Requires Modication. The technology required to implement solution exists but
needs to be modied to t the context of the solution. Important considerations to factor in would be
the extent of the modication, its cost, and how long it would take to bring about the modication.

2.3.9 Exercise Five: Ethical Perspective Pieces
Getting Consent to Information Transfer

Customer Consent If you have followed the case so far, you see that while the money Toysmart owes to
Citibank may just be a drop in the bucket, the welfare and even survival of other Toysmart creditors depends
on how much money can be retrieved through the bankruptcy process. The following Ethical Perspective
argues that the right of creditors for their money cannot be traded o with the right to privacy of Toysmart
customers proled in their now valuable data base. These two stakeholders and their stakesin this case
rightsneed to be integrated as fully as possible. The key lies in the execution of the consumer right to
be informed and to freely consent to the transfer of their data to third parties This right's execution must
address three important aspects.

â€¢ Customer consent must be obtained by having them opt-in rather than opt-out of the transfer of
PII. Opt-in represents a more active, opt-out a more passive mode of consent. By opting into the
data transfer, Toysmart customers consent explicitly, knowingly, and freely to the transfer of their
information. Opt-out is passive because unless customers expressly forbid it, the transfer of their PII
to a third party will occur. The chances are that many customers will consent only if compensated.
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

81
And the mechanics of obtaining positive opt-in consent are complicated. Is this done by email or snail
mail? How can Toysmart customers be fully informed? What kind of timeline is necessary for their full
consent? Implimentation of opt-in consent is more adequate morally speaking but much more dicult,
time-consuming, and costly in its implementation.
â€¢ Any exchange of information must be in accord with TRUSTe standards which Toysmart agreed to
when they solicited the right to use the TRUSTe seal. TRUSTe has its own standards (they can be
found through the link above) which reinforce the above discussion of informed consent but also bring
in other matters. Important here is the utilitarian concern of building and maintaining consumer trust
to encourage their using the Internet for e-business. Web site certication agencies like TRUSTe exist
to validate that a web site is trustworthy; but to maintain this validation, customers must know that
TRUSTe will enforce its standards when websites become reluctant to follow them. TRUSTe must
be aggressive and strict here in order to maintain the high level of trust they have generated with
e-business customers.
â€¢ An important part of TRUSTe standards on the transfer of PII to third parties is their insistence
that these third parties share the values of those who have been given the information. Toysmart
cultivated a reputation as a trustworthy company devoted to producing safe, high quality, educational
toys. The customer data base should be transferred only to concerns that share these goals and the
accompanying values. (What are these?) Did Toysmart compromise on these goals and values when
they agreed to accept Disney nancing and advertising support? What are Toysmart values? What
are Disney values?
In conclusion, this perspective piece is designed to get you to think about the right of informed consent,
whether it can be reconciled with nancial interests and rights of Toysmart creditors, and how this right can
be implemented in the concrete details of this case. It has argued that customer PII can be transferred but
only with the consent of the customers themselves. It has dened this consent in terms of express opting-into
the transfer on the part of the customers. It has also argued that the third part must share the values and
goals of Toysmart, especially those values accompanying Toysmart promises to customers.

Social Responsibility
3.1 Socio-Technical Systems in Professional Decision Making1
3.1.1 Module Introduction
Milagro Beaneld War

Joe Mondragon has created quite a stir in Milagro, a small village in New Mexico. He has illegally diverted
water from the irrigation ditch to his eld to grow beans. Access to scarce water in New Mexico has created
sharp political and social disputes which have reached a crises point in Milagro. Competing with traditional
subsistence farmers like Joe is the protable recreation industry. Ladd Devine, a wealthy developer, has joined
with the state government in New Mexico to build a large recreational center consisting of a restaurant, travel
lodge, individual cabins and a lavish golf course. Since there is not enough water to cover both recreational
and agricultural uses and since Ladd Devine's project promises large tax revenues and new jobs, the state
government has fallen behind him and has promised to give to the recreational facilities all the water it
needs. Hence, the problem created by Mondragon's illegal act. You work for Ladd Devine. He has asked
you to look into local opposition to the recreational facility. Along these lines, you attend the town meeting
scheduled by Ruby Archuleta in the town's church. You are concerned about Charlie Bloom's presentation
and the impact it may have on the local community. Prepare a STS analysis to test Bloom's assertions and
better prepare Ladd Devine for local opposition to his facility.
Incident at Morales

Fred is a chemical engineer hired by Phaust Corporation to design and make operational a new chemical plant
for the manufacture of their newly redesigned paint thinner. Under nancial pressure from the parent French
company, Chemistre, they have decided to locate their new plant in Morales, Mexico to take advantage of
lower costs and more exible government regulations. You are well on the way toward designing this new
plant when news comes from Chemistre that all budgets are being cut 20% to nance Chemistre's latest
takeover acquisition. You are Fred and are now faced with a series of dicult nancial-engineering decisions.
Should you hold out for the more expensive Lutz and Lutz controls or use the cheaper ones produced
locally? Should you continue with the current plant size or cut plant size and capacity to keep within
budgetary constraints? You have also been made aware of the environmental and health risks associated
with not lining the waste ponds used by the plant. Do you advocate lining the ponds or not, the latter being
within compliance for Mexican environmental and health regulations. Prepare a STS analysis to help you
make and justify these decisions. Make a series of recommendations to your supervisors based on this study.
Puerto Rican Projects

steam as a by-product of electricity generation process. Because the steam can be sold to nearby tuna

canning plants, your company wishes to study the feasibility of locating its plant in or near Mayaguez,
Puerto Rico. (Co-generation technology has become very popular and useful in some places.) Carry
out a STS analysis to identify potential problems. Make a recommendation to your company. If your
recommendation is positive, discuss how the plant should be modied to t into the Mayaguez, Puerto
Rico STS.
â€¢ Your company, Southern Gold Resources, is interested in mining dierent regions in central Puerto
Rico for copper and gold. But you know that twenty years earlier, two proposals by two international
mining companies were turned down by the PR government. Carry out a STS study to examine the
feasibility of designing a dierent project that may be more acceptable to local groups. What does your
STS analysis tell you about social and ethical impacts, nancial promise, and likely local opposition.
Can protable mining operations be developed that respect the concerns of opposed groups? What is
your recommendation based on your STS analysis?
â€¢ Windmar, a company that manufactures and operates windmills for electricity generation has proposed
to locate a windmill farm in a location adjacent to the Bosque Seco de Guanica. They have encountered
considerable local opposition. Carry out a STS analysis to understand and clarify this opposition. Can
the concerns of local stakeholders be addressed and the windmill farm still remain protable? How
should the windmill project be modied to improve its chances of implementation?

3.1.2 Things to Know about STSs
What is a Socio-Technical System? (STS)

A socio-technical system (=STS) is a tool to help a business anticipate and successfully resolve interdisciplinary business problems. "Interdisciplinary business problems" refer to problems where nancial values
are intertwined with technical, ethical, social, political, and cultural values. (Reference: Chuck Hu, Good
Computing: A Virtue Approach to Computer Ethics, draft manuscript for Jones and Bartlett Publishers)
Some Things to Know About STSs

1. Socio-Technical systems provide a tool to uncover the dierent environments in which business activity
takes place and to articulate how these constrain and enable dierent business practices.
2. A STS can be divided into dierent components such as hardware software, physical surroundings, people/groups/roles, procedures, laws/statutes/regulations, and information systems. Other components
include the natural environment, markets, and political systems.
3. But while dierent components can be distinguished, these are, in the nal analysis, inseparable. SocioTechnical Systems are rst and foremost systems: their components are interrelated and interact so
that a change in one often produces changes that reverberate through the system.
4. Socio-Technical systems embody moral values such as justice, responsibility, respect, trust, and integrity
as well as non-moral values such as eciency, satisfaction, productivity, eectiveness, and protability.
Often these values can be located in one or more of the system components. Often they conict with
one another causing the system as a whole to change.
5. STSs change, and this change traces out a path or trajectory. The normative challenge here is to bring
about and direct changes that place the STS on a value-positive trajectory. In the nal analysis, we
study STS to make sure that they change in a value-realizing direction.

Machado the UNIX software system and the computers in the UCI laboratories that are congured by
this system. Because technologies are structured to carry out the intentions of their designers, they
embed values.
Physical Surroundings. Physical surroundings can also embed values. Doors, by their weight,
strength, material, size, and attachments (such as locks) can promote values such as security. Physical
surroundings promote, maintain, or diminish other values in that they can permit or deny access,
facilitate or hinder speech, promote privacy or transparency, isolate or disseminate property, and
promote equality or privilege.
People, Groups, and Roles. This component of a STS has been the focus of traditional stakeholder
analyses. A stakeholder is any group or individual which has an essential or vital interest in the
situation at hand. Any decision made or design implemented can enhance, maintain, or diminish this
interest or stake. So if we consider Frank Saia a decision-maker in the Hughes case, then the Hughes
corporation, the U.S. Air Force, the Hughes sub-group that runs environmental tests on integrated
circuits, and Hughes customers would all be considered stakeholders.
Procedures. How does a company deal with dissenting professional opinions manifested by employees?
What kind of due process procedures are in place in your university for contesting what you consider to
be unfair grades? How do researchers go about getting the informed consent of those who will be the
subjects of their experiments? Procedures set forth ends which embody values and legitimize means
which also embody values.
Laws, statutes, and regulations all form essential parts of STSs. This would include engineering
codes as well as the state or professional organizations charged with developing and enforcing them
The nal category can be formulated in a variety of ways depending on the specic context. Computing
systems gather, store, and disseminate information. Hence, this could be labeled data and data
storage structure. (Consider using data mining software to collect information and encrypted and
isolated les for storing it securely.) In engineering, this might include the information generated as
a device is implemented, operates, and is decommissioned. This information, if fed back into rening
the technology or improving the design of next generation prototypes, could lead to uncovering and
preventing potential accidents. Electrical engineers have elected to rename this category, in the context
of power systems, rates and rate structures.

Ethical

challenge

by bringing into
question their normative content.

Involves proving a
mens rea (guilty
mind) and actus

law-breaking act)
and that the mens
rea caused the
actus reus.

To prevail in a
tort one ust prove
(in order of severity)
negligence,
recklessness,
or
intent.

The Puerto Rican
system of law
is based on the
Napoleonic code
where
decisions
relate
directly
to existing law
and statute and
precedent plays a
weaker role.

Laws can challenge
ethical principles
and concepts by
raising issues of
practicality. Also,
as in responsibility
theory, the law
can structure and
inform the moral
discussion.

Criminal law does
not apply to corporations because
they "have no

3.1.4
Ethics of STS Research

â€¢ Right of Free and Informed Consent: This is the right of participants in a research project to
know the harms and benets of the research. It also includes the right not to be forced to participate
in a project but, instead, oer or withdraw voluntarily their consent to participate. When preparing
a STS analysis, it is mandatory to take active measures to facilitate participants's free and informed
consent.
â€¢ Any STS analysis must take active measures to recognize potential harms and minimize or eliminate
them. This is especially the case regarding the information that may be collected about dierent
individuals. Special provisions must be taken to maintain condentiality in collecting, storing, and
using sensitive information. This includes careful disposal of information after it is no longer needed.

3.1.5 Participatory Observation
â€¢ As we said above, a socio-technical system (STS) is an intellectual tool to help us recognize patterns
in the way technology is used and produced. Constructing these tools requires combining modes of
analysis that are ordinarily kept separate. Because STSs embed values, they are normative. These
values can help to chart out trajectories of change and development because they outline values that
the system needs to realize, maintain, or even enhance. In this way, the study of STSs is normative and
a legitimate inquiry for practical and professional ethics. On the other hand, STS analysis requires
nding out what is already there and describing it. So STS analysis is descriptive as well. In this
textbox, we will talk briey about the descriptive or empirical components of STS analysis. This
material is taken from the draft manuscript of Good Computing: A Virtue Approach to Computer
Ethics and has been developed by Chuck Hu.
â€¢ Interviews: Semi-Structured and Structured Interviews conducted with those familiar with a given
STS provide an excellent source of information on the constituents of a given STS and how these t
together into an interrelated whole. For example, the STS grid on power systems was put together
by experts in this area who were able to provide detailed information on power rates and protocols,
software used to distribute energy through the gridlines, and dierent sources (representing both hard
and soft technologies) of power generation.
â€¢ Field Observation: Those constructing a STS analysis go directly to the system and describe it in
its day-to-day operation. Two books provide more information on the types and techniques of eld
observation: 1. David M. Fetterman, Ethnography: 2nd Edition, Applied Social Research Methods
Series, Vol 17. London, UK.: Sage Publishers, 1998 and 2. James P. Spradley, Participant Observation.
New York, Harcourt, 1980. The data collected in this method can also be used to construct day-inthe-life scenarios that describe how a given technology functions on a typical day. These scenarios
are useful for uncovering value conicts and latent accidents. See James T. Reason, Human Error,
Cambridge, UK.: Cambridge University Press, 1990 for information on latent accidents, how they are
detected, and how they are prevented.
â€¢ Questionnaires: Questionnaires are useful for gathering general information from large numbers of
people about a STS. Constructing good questionnaires is a dicult process that requires patience as
well as trial and error. (Trying out questions on classmates and friends is the best way to identify
unclear or misleading questions.) Avoiding complex, overly leading, and loaded questions represent a
few of the challenges facing those who would construct useful questionnaires.
â€¢ Archival and physical trace methods: Looking at user manuals provides insight into how a system
has been designed and how it works. Studying which keys are worn down on computer keyboards
provides information on the kind of work being done. Comparing how a system is intended to work
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

99
with how it is in fact being used is also illuminating, especially when one is interested in tracing the
trajectory of a STS. Working with archival and physical trace methods requires critical thought and
detective work.
â€¢ None of the above methods, taken in isolation, provides complete information on a STS. Triangulation
represents the best way to verify data and to reconcile conicting data. Here we generate evidence and
data from a variety of sources then compare and collate. Claims made by interviewees that match direct
on-site observations conrm one another and indicate data strength and veracity. Evidence collected
through questionnaires that conicts with evidence gathered through archival research highlights the
need for detective work that involves further observation, comparison, interpretation, and criticism.
â€¢ Developing STS analyses bears a striking resemblance to requirements analysis. In both cases, data
is collected, rened, and put together to provide an analysis. A key to success in both is the proper
combination of normative and descriptive procedures.

3.1.7 Exercise 2: Identify Value Mismatches in the STS
Directions: identify the values embedded in the STS. Use the table below to suggest possible

1. Integrity: "Integrity refers to the attributes exhibited by those who have incorporated moral values
into the core of their identities. Such integration is evident through the way values denoting moral excellence permeate and color their expressions, actions, and decisions. Characteristics include wholeness,
stability, sincerity, honesty to self and others, suthenticity, and striving for excellence.

CHAPTER 3.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

2. Justice: Justice as fairness focuses on giving each individual what is his or her due. Three senses of justice are (1) the proper, fair, and proportionate use of sanctions, punishments and disciplinary measures
to enforce ethical standards (retributive justice), (2) the objective, dispassionate, and impartial distribution of the benets and burdens associated with a system of social cooperation (distributive justice),
(3) an objectively determined and fairly administered compensation for harms and injustices suered
by individuals (compensatory justice), and (4) a fair and impartial formulation and administration of
rules within a given group.
3. Respect: Respecting persons lies essentially in recognizing their capacity to make and execute decisions
as well as to set forth their own ends and goals and integrate them into life plans and identities. Respects
underlies rights essential to autonomy such as property, privacy, due process, free speech, and free and
informed consent.
4. Responsibility: (Moral) Responsibility lies in the ability to identify the morally salient features of a
situation and then develop actions and attitudes that answer to these features by bringing into play
moral and professional values. Responsibility includes several senses: (1) individuals are responsible in
that they can be called upon to answer for what they do; (2) individuals have responsibilities because
of commitments they make to carrying out the tasks associated with social and professional roles; (3)
responsibility also refers to the way in which one carries out one's obligations (This can range from
indierence to others that leads to minimal eort to high care for others and commitment to excellence)
5. Free Speech: Free Speech is not an unlimited right. Perhaps the best place to start is Mill's argument
in On Liberty. Completely true, partially true, and even false speech cannot be censored, the latter
because censoring false speech deprives the truth of the opportunity to clarify and invigorate itself by
defending itself. Mill only allows for a limitation of free speech based on harm to those at which the
speech is directed. Speech that harms an individual (defamatory speech or shouting "re" in a crowded
theatre) can be censored out of a consideration of self-defense, not of the speaker, but of those who
stand to be harmed by the speech.
6. Privacy: If an item of information is irrelevant to the relation between the person who has the information and the person sho seeks it, then that information is private. Privacy is necessary to autonomy
because control over information about oneself helps one to structure and shape one's relations with
others.
7. Property: According to Locke, we own as property that with which we have mixed our labor. Thomas
Jeerson argues that ideas are problematic as property because, by their very nature, they are shared
once they are expressed. They are also nonrivalrous and nonexclusive.
Drawing Problems from Embedded Values

â€¢ Changes in a STS (e.g., the integration of a new technology) produce value mismatches as the values
in the new component conict with those already existing within the STS. Giving laptops to children
produces a conict between children's safety requirements and the safety features embedded in laptops
as designed for adults.
â€¢ Changes within a STS can exaggerate existing value conicts. Using digitalized textbooks on laptop
computers magnies the existing conict concerning intellectual property; the balance between copyrights and educational dissemination is disrupted by the ease of copying and distributing digitalized
media.
â€¢ Changes in STS can also lead to long term harms. Giving laptops to children threatens environmental
harm as the laptops become obsolete and need to be safely disposed of.

3.1.8 Using Socio-Technical System Grids for Problem Specication
The activity of framing is a central component of moral imagination. Framing a situation structures its
elements into a meaningful whole. This activity of structuring suggests both problems and solutions. Framing
a situation in dierent ways oers alternative problem specications and solution possibilities. Since skillful
framing requires practice, this part of the module suggests how socio-technical system tables can help provide
dierent frames for problem specication and solution generation.
Dierent Problem Frames

â€¢ Technical Frame: Engineers frame problems technically, that is, they specify a problem as raising a
technical issue and requiring a technical design for its resolution. For example, in the STS grid appended
below, the Burger Man corporation wishes to make its food preparation areas more safe. Framing this
technically, it would be necessary to change the designs of ovens so they are more accident-proof.
â€¢ Physical Frame: How can the Burger Man corporation redesign its restaurants as physical facilities
to make them more accessible? One way is to change the access points by, say, designing ramps to
make restaurants wheel chair accessible. Framing this as a physical problem suggests solutions based
on changing the physical structure and arrangement of the Burger Man STS.
â€¢ Social Frame: Burger Man as a corporation has stakeholders, that is, groups or individuals who have
an essential interest at play in relation to the corporation. For example, framing the problem of making
Burger Man more safe as a social problem might suggest the solution of integrating workplace safety
into worker training programs and conducting regular safety audits to identify embedded risks.
â€¢ Financial or Market-Based Frames: Burger Man is a for-prot corporation which implies that
it has certain nancial responsibilities. Consequently, Burger Man should be concerned with how to
provide safe, child-proof chairs and tables that do not cut unduly into corporate prots. But like the
legal perspective, it is necessary to conduct ethical and social framing activities to compensate for the
one-sidedness of nancial framing.
â€¢ Managerial Frame: Many times ethical problems can be framed as managerial problems where the
solution lies in changing managerial structures, reporting relations, and operating procedures. For
example, Burger Man may develop a specic procedure when a cashier nishes a shift and turns over
the cash register and its contents to another cashier. Burger Man may develop cleaning procedures
and routines to minimize the possibility of serving contaminated or spoiled food to customers.

102

CHAPTER 3.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

â€¢ Legal Frame: Burger Man may choose to frame its environmental responsibilities into developing
eective procedures for complying with OSHAA and EPA regulations. Framing a problem legally
certainly helps to identify eective and necessary courses of action. But, because the ethical and social
cannot be reduced to the legal, it is necessary to apply other frames to uncover additional risks not
suggested by the legal framing.
â€¢ Environmental Framing: Finally, how does Burger Man look from the environmental standpoint?
Does it consider environmental value (environmental health, safety, and integrity) as merely a side
constraint to be addressed only insofar as it interferes with realizing supposedly more important values
such as nancial values? Is it a value to be traded o with other values? (For example, Burger Man
may destroy the local environment by cutting down trees to make room for its latest restaurant but
it osets this destruction through its program of planting new trees in Puerto Rican tropical rain
forests.) Framing a problem as an environmental problem puts the environment rst and sets as a goal
the integration of environmental values with other values such as worker safety and corporate prots.

is unique to the situation posed by the case. This module also presents background constraints to problemsolving in engineering, business, and computer ethics. These constraints do not dier absolutely from the
constituents of STSs. However, they pose underlying constraints that outline the feasibility of an ethical
decision and help us to identify obstacles that may arise when we attempt to implement ethical decisions.

professional practice on a day-to-day basis. This module will give students the opportunity to practice using
frameworks and techniques that address these two needs.
Developing socio-technical system analyses provides an eective means to highlight issues of social responsibility. Since socio-technical systems embody values, building their descriptions allows us to read o
potential problems due to harmful impacts and value conicts. To facilitate this, you will be building sociotechnical system descriptions using a grid or matrix that provides the components of socio-technical systems,
levels under which they can be analyzed, and the values that they tend to embody. Building socio-technical
system descriptions also requires using methods of participatory observation. These include constructing surveys and questionnaires, developing interviews, and building day-in-the-life scenarios. This module will help
you frame and respond to social responsibility issues by providing a framework for socio-technical analysis
and a set of methodological tools taken from participatory observation.
Module m14025 (Social-Technical Systems in Professional Decision Making) provides background information on STSs, their construction and their uses. Links to this module and to the website, Computing
Cases, can be found in the upper left hand corner of this module. They provide useful background information. This module makes use of a case, Texas Laptops, that was developed by Chuck Hu and C. Nathan
DeWall for NSF projects, DUE-9972280 and DUE-9980768.

3.2.2 Case Narrative
Texas Laptop Case

1. In the late 1990's, the Texas State Board of Education proposed the ambitious plan of providing each of
the state's four million public school students with their own laptop computer. This plan was devised
to solve several problems confronting Texas public education.
2. Laptop computers could make educational resources more accessable to students who were faced with
special challenges like deafness or blindness. Computers oer software options (such as audio books)
that promise to reach more students than traditional printed textbooks.
3. Laptops also promised to solve the problem of obsolete textbooks. Texas purchased textbooks for their
students at considerable costs. The purchasing cycle ran six years. By the end of this cycle, textbooks
were out of date. For example, in the late 1990's when the laptop plan was proposed, history textbooks
still referred to the Soviet Union and to the existence of the Berlin Wall. Laptops, on the other hand,
would present textbook content in digital form which would eliminate printing and shipping costs and
facilitate updates through online downloads.
4. Texas business leaders were concerned about the computer literacy of the upcoming generation of
students. By employing laptops in more and more teaching activities, students would learn how to
interact with computers while taking advantage of the new and more eective modes of presentation
oered.
1. However, adopting laptops also presented problems that critics quickly brought forth.
2. Teachers would need to learn how to use laptop computers and would have to change their teaching to
accomodate them in the classroom.
3. Apparent cost savings disappeared upon further, closer examination. For example, it became clear
that textbook publishers would not so easily give up the revenues they had come to depend upon that
came from textbook purchases for public school students. Updates from downloads could turn out to
be more expensive and eductional software could be coded to restrict access and dissemination.
4. Further studies indicated that technical support costs would run two to three times initial outlays.
Keeping laptop hardware and software up and running required technical support and continued investment.
5. Texas found that while some school districtsthe richer oneshad already begun projects to integrate
computing technology, the poorer school districts would require considerable nancial support.

105
To deal with these problems, Texas carried out several pilot projects that examined the eectiveness of
laptop integration in select school districts. While several successes were reported a series of problems arose
that led Texas Board of Educaton ocials to postpone the laptop project. First, pilot projects depended on
donations from private computing vendors. While some were forthcoming, others failed to deliver hardware
on time and provided only minimal technical support. Second, teachers resisted laptop integration due to
the extensive investment of time required to appropriate computing skills and the diculty of modifying
existing curricula and teaching styles to accomodate laptop hardware and software. Third, at that time the
available educational software, such as digitalized textbooks, was expensive, inadequately developed, and
narrowly focused on curricular areas such as writing and math practice. Teachers also began to develop more
comprehensive and philosophical criticisms of laptop use. Education specialist, Larry Cuban, argued that
while laptops provided good support for a vocational education, they failed to deliver on other educational
goals such as teaching children how to interact with their peers and teachers and teaching children the civic
virtues necessary to become active participants in a democratic form of government. Studies began to appear
that argued that skills developed through computer use came at the expense of other, more social skills.
The Texas Laptop plan was never formally implemented beyond the pilot project phase. However, several
computer integration projects have been carried out in other parts of the country. For example, Larry Cuban
reports on computer integration projects carried out in Silicon Valley in California. MIT has developed a
cheap laptop computer for use in developing nations. You can nd a link to computer integration projects
that have been implemented in Philadelphia public schools through the support of the Microsoft Foundation.
Students in computer ethics classes at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez have looked into the
feasibility of integrating laptops in the public school socio-technical system in Puerto Rico. They began by
looking at the project to provide public school teachers with laptops that was carried out in the late 1990's
under the Pedro Rossello administration. The student research projects came to focus on three problem
areas. First, they examined whether there were structures in laptop design that made computers unt
for use by children. Second, they studied whether social or ethical problems would arise from disposal of
spent laptops. Third, they investigated the impact on copyright law and intellectual property practices that
digitalizing printed textbooks would have.

selecting the kind of computer to be used

developing an implementing a training program to help teachers learn to use computers
designing a technical support hotline to help teacher work out any technical problems that may arise

Distributing computers to high school teachers seems simple enough. You select the computers, buy them, and give them to the teachers. Yet only a slight change in circumstances can
bring into the open latent or potential ethical issues:

â€¢ How should you go about setting up the bidding process to determine the computers to be used?
â€¢ What should you do to determine teacher and student needs and how computers can respond to these
needs? It makes very little sense to provide computers and then tell teachers and students to use them.
What are they to do with these computers? How do they t them into everyday education? This
requires seeing the computer project from the standpoints of students, their parents, and teachers.
The reversibility test will help here.
â€¢ Who stands to benet from your actions? Who stands to be harmed from these actions? How will
benets and harms be distributed through the dierent stakeholders in this case?

CHAPTER 3.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

â€¢ Latent ethical problems exist in this socio-technical system that can erupt into full-blown
problems with small changes in circumstances

â€¢ Someone you know wellsay your cousinsubmits a bid. What ethical issues does this turn of events
give rise to?
â€¢ The contract to provide computers is awarded to you cousin, and he provides reliable computers at a
reasonable price. The, a few weeks later, you read the following headline in the newspaper: "More
Government CorruptionComputer Czar's Cousin Counts Millions in Cozy Computer
Contract" What do you do now?

â€¢ A group of angry high school teachers holds a press conference in which they accuse the government of
forcing them to use computing technology in their classes. They say you are violating their academic
freedom. How should you respond?
â€¢ Someone in the government suggesting placing a program in each computer that allows government
ocials to monitor the computers and track user behavior. How would you feel if your computer
use were being monitored without your knowledge or consent> Are their circumstances under which
monitoring could bring about any social benets? What are the likely harms? Do the benets outweigh
the harms? Suppose you go along with this and read the following headline in the morning newspaper:
"Government Snoops B ug High School computers". Using the publicity test, what kind of
person would you appear to be in the public's eye? How would you view yourself in terms of this
action?
3.2.3.2 Decision Point Two
You are Dr. Negroponte from MIT. For several years now, you have been working to design
laptop computers that respond to a wide range of needs of children in poor, developing nations.
You have set up an incentive for people in developed nations to contribute to children in poor
nations. For $300, one can buy two laptops, keep one, and have the other donated to a
child in a developing nation. This has generated computers but governments in developing
nationsenthusiastic at rsthave recently shown themselves reluctant to carry through on
their commitments. Your goal of reducing laptop costs to $100 per computer have also stalled.
It has been dicult to generate projected economies of scale.

â€¢ The laptops employ a simple design. They use Linux as an operating system since this shareware
can be freely downloaded. The computers are also designed to be used in areas where the underlying
infrastructure, especially electricity, is unreliable. They are battery driven and a hand crank allows for
recharging batteries when electricity is unavailable. They employ a wireless connection to the Internet.
â€¢ An Open Education Resource movement has been started to generate educational resources directly and
freely available to children using MIT laptops. This movement has generated considerable educational
content of varying qualities. Reports available online provide insights into the pros and cons of the open
resource educational movement. Whether this can (or should) replace traditional textbooks (which can
be quite expensive and dicult to update) is still open to debate.
â€¢ There is evidence that laptops can and have contributed to an enhanced learning experience for children
in developing nations. Poor attendance, a large and chronic problem, has been improved in laptop
programs. Children enjoy their computers and seem better motivated in general as a result. They
take their computers home for homework and share them with the rest of their family. Many teachers
have successfully adapted their teaching styles to this Internet-supported, technologically enhanced
educational mode.
â€¢ But recently, laptops have come under increasing critical scrutiny.
â€¢ They are more expensive than traditional educational materials such as textbooks
â€¢ They compete for scarce nancial resources and may be less cost-eective in the long run than other,
more traditional educational resources.

107

â€¢ The MIT laptop has no hard drive, a fact critically singled out by Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates.
They have been designed to use the Linus operating system rather than Microsoft's more expensive
and complicated one.
â€¢ Developing nation government's have recently shown "cold feet" to putting action behind their verbal
commitments to laptop computers. This may, in part, be due to concerns expressed by parents and
teachers.
â€¢ Defend the MIT Laptop Project in the face of these and other criticisms.
â€¢ Should their design be modied to suit better children's needs as well as the concerns of teachers and
parents?
â€¢ What features do MIT laptops already display that respond to student, parent, and teacher needs?
â€¢ What are the alternatives to MIT Laptops? For example, evaluate the proposal made by a group
in computer ethics to invest in and emphasize instruction in computer laboratories housed in schools
themselves. What problems would this new approach avoid? What are its limitations in comparison
to the laptop approach?
3.2.3.3 Decision Point Three

â€¢ You live in a developing nation. While you have work, it doesn't pay well and you are
barely able to provide for your family's basic needs. One problem and things will get
very dicult for you and your family.

â€¢ Your child came home with an MIT-designed laptop computer. She and her classmates have beneted
from the computers donated to their school by the generosity of developed nations where concerned
citizens can buy two computers and have one donated to needy children. You nd this somewhat
patronizing and you see these laptops as a mixed blessing.
â€¢ On the one hand, this laptop has helped you and your family to enjoy the benets of access to the
Internet, although, because of poor infrastructure, this access is limited, sporadic, and subject to
frequent breakdowns. On the other hand, you question whether your child is mature enough to use
and care for her computer. If anything should happen, you would be required to buy a new replacement
laptop, and you simply don't have the money.
â€¢ Yet should you not replace your daughter's broken laptop, she would be excluded from the education
her peers enjoy because she would no longer have a computer. You question whether you want to run
on this "treadmill."
â€¢ Furthermore, you can see that laptopseven MIT laptopsare designed for adults, not children. They
are made of heavy metals and other toxic materials. The batteries, especially, are dangerous because
of the materials they contain. They wear out and replacing them can be expensive.
â€¢ Your child could also become a target for robbers. She walks to and from school carrying her computer,
and you know of other children who have been beaten and robbed of their laptops.
â€¢ So you see these laptops as a mixed blessing fraught with risk. What should you do?

3.2.4 What you are going to do...
Exercise 1: Prepare a STS Grid

â€¢ Construct a socio-technical system (STS) grid for public schools in Puerto Rico
â€¢ Using the templates found at m14025 (Socio-Technical Systems in Professional Decision Making) identify the key constituents such as hardware, software, physical surroundings, etc.
â€¢ Select key levels for analysis. For example, you may want to look at the STS from the standpoint of
individuals (students and teachers), small groups (public school systems), and institutions (education
and business).

CHAPTER 3.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

â€¢ Starting with a short list of values, identify the values embedded in the public school STS and, if
possible, the specic components in which these values are embedded. A good place to start is to see
how dierent physical arrangements of the classroom embody dierent approaches to education.
Values in STSs

Values that can be used for exercise 1 include Justice (equity and access), Property, Privacy, Free Speech,
Responsibility (Safety). More on these values can be found by clicking on the Computing Cases link provided
in this module. Several of these values are dened in the Ethics of Team Work module, m13769.
Exercise 2: Identifying Potential or Latent Problems in STSs

â€¢ Choose one of the following three problem areas to help focus your work: (1) value problems that may
arise when laptops with their current design are integrated in the PR STS; (2) value problems that
may arise by the digitalization of textbooks and other educational materials; (3) value problems and
potential harms that may arise during the disposal of spent laptops.
â€¢ Compare values embodied in current laptop design with those embodied in the Puerto Rican public
school STS. Are there any conicts? What are these?
â€¢ Look more closely at the Puerto Rican public school STS. Are there any conicts that will be highlighted, exaggerated, or increased by the integration of laptop computers.
â€¢ Finally, look for potential harms that could occur in the short, middle, and long term future.
Exercise 3: Develop Counter-Measures to Problems

â€¢ Generate 5 to 10 options to respond to the problems you have identied. Make sure that you include
the status quo among your options.
â€¢ Check each option against the problems you have identied. Does the option solve the problems
identied in your STS analysis? Does it integrate the conicting values and avoid untoward results?
Does it give rise to new problems?
â€¢ Prepare a short presentation for the class (5 to 10 minutes) where you outline your problem, set forth
the range of solutions you have identied, and describe and justify your solution. Be sure to address
issues that may arise when you turn to implementing your solution.
â€¢ Provide a one or two sentence argument that your solution is best for delivering on social responsibility.
Exercise 4: Evaluate the Microsoft Philadelphia Public Schools Project

â€¢ Listen to/read the news report on the Microsoft Foundation's project to integrate computing technology
in Philadelphia. (You can nd it by clicking on the link in this module.)
â€¢ Is this an example of a corporation carrying out its social responsibility to the surrounding community?.
â€¢ Evaluate Microsoft generally in terms of its social responsibility.

4.1.2 Module Introduction
In this module, you will learn about professional and occupational codes of ethics by looking at a bad code,
writing your own code, and then critically examine a professional code of ethics, the engineering code for
the Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico. Three exercises will take you through the process
of examining the Pirate Creed, writing your own code, and examining the Colegio's code. Text boxes will
provide helpful background information on purposes served by professional codes, philosophical objections,
and a framework for working your way through a stakeholder-based code like that of the CIAPR or the
National Society of Professional Engineers. This module provides a Spanish translation of the Pirate Creed
prepared by Dr. Dana Livingston Collins of the Department of Humanities in the University of Puerto Rico
at MayaguÌˆez.
Concluding this module are two word documents uploaded as media les. One provides the exercises
that are presented in this module in XML format. The other provides the background information that has
been presented in this module as Textboxes.

4.1.3 Module Activities
1. You will analyze the Pirate Creed in terms of (a) its dierent functions, (b) the community values it
embodies, and (c) how it stands toward nonmembers of the pirate community as well as members.
2. You will write a code of ethics for an occupational or professional area such as business or engineering.
3. You will debrief the rest of the class on your group's code, clarify its functions and values, and defend
it if necessary.
4. This module will conclude with a look at the code of ethics of the Puerto Rico State Society of
Professional Engineers and Land surveyors or Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto
Rico.

CHAPTER 4.

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

4.1.4 Pirates Creed of Ethics (translated into Spanish by Dana Collins)
1. El capitÃ¡n tendrÃ¡ comando total durante una batalla y tendrÃ¡ la autoridad para dirigir el barco. El
que no sigua al capitÃ¡n podrÃ¡ ser castigado se la tripulaciÃ³n no vota en contra del castigo.
2. Si el barco naufraga, la tripulaciÃ³n permanecerÃ¡ unidos hasta el capitÃ¡n consigue otra nave. Si la nave
es propiedad comÃºn de la tripulaciÃ³n, la primera nave capturada pertenecerÃ¡ al capitÃ¡n con una (1)
parte de botÃ­n.
3. El cirujano del barco recibirÃ¡ doscientas (200) coronas para el mantenimiento de su equipo mÃ©dico y
recibirÃ¡ una (1) parte del botÃ­n.
4. Los otros ociales recibirÃ¡n una (1) parte cada uno, y si se distinguen, la tripulaciÃ³n determinarÃ¡
cuanto recibirÃ¡n como recompensa.
5. El botÃ­n de una nave capturada serÃ¡ distribuido en partes iguales.
6. El primero que seÃ±ale la apariciÃ³n de un barco que sea capturado recibirÃ¡ cien (100) coronas.
7. El que pierda un ojo, una mano, o una pierna mientras estÃ¡ en servicio, recibirÃ¡ hasta seis esclavos o
seiscientas (600) coronas.
8. Los suministros y raciones serÃ¡n compartidos por igual.
9. La penalidad por traer una mujer disfrazada a bordo es la muerte.
10. Si un hermano roba de otro, perderÃ¡ su nariz u orejas. Se peca de nuevo, se le darÃ¡n un mosquete,
municiones, plomo y una botella de agua y serÃ¡ abandonado en una isla.
11. Si hay duda en una disputa entre hermanos, una corte de honor determinarÃ¡ el veredicto. Si un
hermano es encontrado culpable, la primera vez serÃ¡ perdonado, pero al ofender de nuevo, serÃ¡ atado
a un caÃ±Ã³n y recibirÃ¡ un latigazo de cada miembro de la tripulaciÃ³n. El mismo castigo serÃ¡ dado a
todos, incluyendo ociales, quienes se emborrachen al punto de perder sus sentidos mientras estÃ©n en
el barco.
12. El que se duerma mientras estÃ¡ trabajando como centinela, recibirÃ¡n latigazos por todos los miembros
de la tripulaciÃ³n. Se repite el crimen, su cabeza serÃ¡ rajada.
13. A todos quienes conspiren para desertar, o lo que hayan desertado y sean capturados, sus cabezas serÃ¡n
rajadas.
14. Pelas entre varios hermanos mientras estÃ©n a bordo serÃ¡ resueltos en tierra con pistolas y espadas. El
que saque primera sangre serÃ¡ el vencedor. No pueden golpear a otro mientras estÃ©n a bordo de la
nave.

What values are embedded in the Pirate Creed
How does the Pirate Creed deal with nonmembers?

4.1.6 Exercise 2: Writing a Code of Ethics for Engineers
â€¢ Step One: Identify the purpose behind your engineering code of ethics. For example, is it to punish
wrongful behavior, provide a set of guidelines, educate the community, support ethical behavior, or
create an ethics dialogue?
â€¢ Step Two: Identify the contributions that engineering makes to society.
â€¢ Step Three: Identify the stakeholders of the engineering profession. A stakeholder is any group or
individual with a vital or essential interest tied to what engineers do. along with these stakeholders,
identify their stakes, that is, the goods, rights, interests or values that are maintained, promoted, or
diminished by what engineers do?

111

â€¢ Step Four: Enumerate the obligations or duties that engineers have toward each of these stakeholders.
In other words, what can engineers do to maintain, promote, or diminish the stakes of each stakeholder?
â€¢ Step Five: Identify the conicting obligations that arise from the fact that engineers have dierent
stakeholders who hold conicting stakes? Do any of these stakeholders or stakes have obvious priority
over the others?
â€¢ Step Six: Step back and reect on what you have written. For example, look for dierent kinds of
provisions. Does your code use ideals of the profession which set forth the profession's central or
cardinal objectives? Does your code contain principles of professional conduct which set forth
minimal levels of behavior and prerscribe sanctions and punishments for compliance failures? In the
CIAPR (Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico) code of ethics, the fundamental
principles and basic canons set forth the ideals of the profession. The principles of professional conduct
fall in the section on practical norms.
â€¢ Step Seven: The Final Audit. Submit your code to an overall audit to see if anything has been
left out. Have you included all the stakeholders and their stakes? Have you left out any ethical
considerations such as rights and duties? Compare your code to the law. Are your code's provisions
legal? Do they overlap with existing law? Do they imply criticisms of existing laws? If they imply
punishments or sanctions, what measures does your code prescribe to administer justly and properly
these sanctions? Finally, be sure to guard against the equal but opposite sins of over-specicity and
too much generality. Overly specic codes try to provide a rule for every possible situation. Because
this is impossible, these codes tend toward rigidity, inexibility, and irrelevance. Codes that are too
general fail because they can be interpreted to rationalize any kind of claim and, thus, mask immoral
actions and intentions.

4.1.7 Exercise 3: Studying the code of Ethics of the Colegio de Ingenieros y
Agrimensores de Puerto Rico
â€¢ Identify the provisions that touch upon the relation of the engineer to the public. What goods are at
stake in this relation? What can engineers do to preserve or promote these goods?
â€¢ Identify provisions that touch upon the relation of the engineer to the client. What goods are at stake
in this relation? What can engineers do to preserve or promote these goods?
â€¢ Identify provisions that touch upon the relation of the engineer to the CIAPR (professional engineering
society) What goods are at stake in this relation? what can engineers do to preserve or promote these
goods?.
â€¢ Finally, identify provisions that touch upon the relation of the engineer to other engineers (peer relations). What goods are at stake in this relation? What can engineers do to preserve or promote these
goods?

4.1.8 Textbox 1: Code of Ethics of Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de
Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico State society of Professional Eng
â€¢ The CIAPR code of ethics has three parts:
â€¢ Part One: Three Fundamental Principles which express cardinal objectives for engineering practice in
Puerto Rico
â€¢ Part Two: Ten Canons which set forth general rules for ethical engineering practice
â€¢ Part Three: Each canon is repeated followed by several practical norms. by setting forth detailed rules,
practical norms specify and interpret the basic canons. They also set forth specic and concrete rules
for professional and ethical conduct
â€¢ The CIAPR code of ethics is a stakeholder code. This means it identies engineering stakeholders, the
goods they depend upon, and the duties engineers have in protecting or promoting these goods.

CHAPTER 4.

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

Key Engineer Relations

â€¢ The relation between engineer and public is founded on the goods of health, safety and welfare.
â€¢ The relation between engineer and client is founded on the good of faithful agency (trust).
â€¢ The relation between the individual engineer and the profession is founded on the engineer working
to maintain the good reputation and integrity of the profession.
â€¢ The peer relation between practicing engineers is founded on the good of collegiality.
Engineer and Public

â€¢ Duties arising in this relation are tied to maintaining or promoting the goods of health, safety, and
welfare. They include minimizing harm, avoiding paternalism (making decisions for others who have
the right and ability to make these for themselves), free and informed consent (the right of those taking
a risk to consent to that risk).
â€¢ FP1: DeberÃ¡n considerar su principal funciÃ³n como profesionales la de servir a la humanidad. Su
relaciÃ³n como professional y cliente, y como professional y patrono, deberÃ¡ estar sujeta a su funciÃ³n
fundamental de promover el bienestar de la humanidad y la de proteger el interÃ©s pÃºblico.
â€¢ Canon 1: Velar por sobre toda otra consideraciÃ³n por la seguridad, el ambiente, la salud y el bienestar
de la comunidad en la ejecuciÃ³n de sus responsabilidades profesionales.
â€¢ Practical Norm 1d: Cuando tengan conocimiento o suciente razÃ³n para creer que otro ingeniero
o agrimensor viola las disposiciones de este CÃ³digo, o que una persona o rma pone en peligro la
seguridad, el ambiente, la salud o el bienestar de la comunidad, presentarÃ¡n tal informaciÃ³n por escrito
a las autoridades concernidas y cooperarÃ¡n con dichas autoridades proveyendo aquella informaciÃ³n o
asistencia que les sea requerida.
Engineer to Client

â€¢ Duties stemming from this relation arise out of faithful agency, that is, the responsibility of an engineer
to remain true to the client's interests. Positively this includes exercising due care for the client by
carrying out the client's interests through the exercise of sound, competent engineering professional
judgment. Negatively this entails avoiding conicts of interest and revealing the client's condential
information.
â€¢ Faithful Agency: Canon 4Actuar en asuntos profesionales para cada patrono o cliente como agentes
eles o duciarios, y evitar conictos de intereses o la mera apariencia de Ã©stos, manteniendo siempre
la independencia de criterio como base del profesionalismo.
â€¢ Conict of Interest: 4aEvitarÃ¡n todo conicto de intereses conocido o potencial con sus patronos
o clientes e informarÃ¡n con prontitud a sus patronos o clientes sobre cualquier relaciÃ³n de negocios,
intereses o circunstancias que pudieran inuenciar su juicio o la calidad de sus servicios.
â€¢ Condentiality: 4iTratarÃ¡n toda informaciÃ³n, que les llegue en el curso de sus encomiendas profesionales, como condencial y no usarÃ¡n tal informaciÃ³n como medio para lograr benecio personal si
tal acciÃ³n es adversa a los intereses de sus clientes, de sus patronos, de las comisiones o juntas a las
que pudiera pertenecer o del pÃºblico.
Engineer to Profession

â€¢ This includes working to promote the profession's autonomy and independence as well as maintaining its good reputation. Moreover it requires that engineers participate in their professional
society, work to advance engineering, be objective and impartial in their work, and associate only with
persons of good reputation.
â€¢ Canon 3: Emitir declaraciones pÃºblicas Ãºnicamente en una forma veraz y objetiva.
â€¢ Practical Norm 3a: SerÃ¡n objetivos y veraces en informes profesionales, declaraciones o testimonios.
IncluirÃ¡n toda la informaciÃ³n relevante y pertinente en tales informes, declaraciones o testimonios.
Engineer to Engineer

113

â€¢ This relation is based on the good of Collegiality. It requires that engineers work to maintain friendly
and collaborative relations with other engineers by avoiding disloyal competition and comparative
advertising and by always giving peers due credit for their contributions to engineering projects and
designs.
â€¢ Practical Norm 4l: Antes de realizar trabajos para otros, en los cuales puedan hacer mejoras, planos,
diseÃ±os, inventos, u otros registros, que puedan justicar la obtenciÃ³n de derechos de autor o patentes,
llegarÃ¡n a un acuerdo en relaciÃ³n con los derechos de las respectivas partes. (Give due credit to
colleagues for their work).
â€¢ Canon 5: Edicar su reputaciÃ³n profesional en el mÃ©rito de sus servicios y no competir deslealmente
con otros. (Avoid disloyal competition)
â€¢ Practical Norm 6b: AnunciarÃ¡n sus servicios profesionales sin auto-alabanza y sin lenguaje engaÃ±oso y de una manera en que no se menoscabe la dignidad de sus profesiones. (Non-comparative
advertising)
â€¢ Practical Norm 5h: No tratarÃ¡n de suplantar, ni suplantarÃ¡n otro ingeniero o agrimensor, despuÃ©s de
que una gestiÃ³n profesional le haya sido ofrecida o conada a Ã©ste, ni tampoco competirÃ¡ injustamente
con Ã©l. (Avoid disloyal competition)

4.1.9 Professional Codes as Social Contracts
â€¢ What some have said about dening ethics could also be applied to dening a profession: it's a bit
like "nailing jello to a tree." Nevertheless, we can make to reasonable claims about professions: tye
can be treated as social contracts, and they have someting to do with specialized knowledge. If these
two claims hold, then a third claim can be made, namely, that professions have an ineliminable ethical
dimension.
â€¢ A legitimate contract between two parties requires a quid pro quo (a mutually benecial exchange)
and free consent (consent that includes full information and excludes force or deception). The social
contract between engineering and society can be pictured int he following way:
Profession as Social Contract
Society grants to Profession

Profession grants to Society

Autonomy

Self-Regulation

Prestige

Primacy of public health, safety, and welfare

Monopoly

Developing and enforcing ethical and professional standards
Table 4.1

Society grants autonomy, prestige, and monopoly control to the profession of engineering.

1. Autonomy includes freedom from regulation and control from the outside through cumbersome laws,
regulations, and statutes.
2. Prestige includes high social status and generous pay.
3. Monopoly status implies that the profession of engineering itself determines who can practice engineering and how it should be practiced.
4. The profession promises to use its autonomy responsibly by regulating itself. it does this by developing
and enforcing professional and ethical standards. By granting prestige to the profession, society has
removed the need for the profession to collectively bargain for its self-interest.
5. Not having to worry about its collective self-interest, the profession is now free to hold paramount the
health, safety, and welfare of the public.

CHAPTER 4.

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

6. This contract explains why professions develop codes of ethics. Codes document to the public the
profession's commitment to carry out its side of the social contract, namely, to hold paramount public
welfare. They can do this because society will honor its side of the contract, namely, to remove from
the profession the need to ght for its self-interest
This social contract is more symbolic and explanatory than real.

â€¢ Codes allow the profession to document to society that it has developed proper standards and intends
to enforce them. They express the profession's trust in society to keep its side of the bargain by
granting autonomy, prestige, and monopoly. Of course this contract has never been explicitly enacted
at a point in historical time. But the notion of a social contract with a mutually benecial exchange
(a quid pro quo) provides a useful device for modeling the relation that has actually evolved between
society and its professions.
Professions and Responsibility

â€¢ Professions have been created to exercise stewardship over knowledge and skill domains.
â€¢ Exercising stewardship over X generally means watching over, preserving, protecting, and even improving X. Stewardship is a forward-looking kind of responsibility similar to the responsibility that a
parent exercises toward his or her children. The steward is a trusted servant or agent of the landowner
who acts in the owner's place while the later is absent or incapacitated.
â€¢ "Stewardship," thus, refers to the profession's responsibility to safeguard its specic domain of knowledge and skill. This domain is essential to society in some way (it provides society with a basic, common
good) and society delegates responsibility for this domain to its members who are specially suited to
exercise it.
â€¢ So, generally speaking, professions can be characterized in terms of epistemological and ethical responsibilities.
â€¢ The epistemological responsibility refers to stewardship over the knowledge and skills that characterizes
the profession. The profession preserves, transmit, and advances this domain of knowledge and skill.
(Epistemology = study of knowledge.)
â€¢ The ethical dimension refers to the responsibility of the profession to safeguard knowledge and skill
for the good of society. Society trusts the profession to do this for the sake of the comnmon good.
Society also trusts the profession to regulate its own activities by developing and enforcing ethical and
professional standards.

4.1.10 Objections to and Mischievous Side Eects of Codes of Ethics
These objections are taken from John Ladd, "The Quest for a Code of Professional Ethics: An
Intellectual and Moral Confusion." This article can be found in Deborah G. Johnson, editor,
(1991) Ethical Issues in Engineering, New Jersey: Prentice Hall: 130-136. The author of this
module has taken some liberties in this presentation.

â€¢ Codes "confuse ethics with law-making" (Ladd, 130). Ethics is deliberative and argumentative
while law-making focuses on activities such as making and enforcing rules and policies.
â€¢ A code of ethics is an oxymoron. Ethics requires autonomy of the individual while a code assumes
the legitimacy of an external authority imposing rule and order on that individual.
â€¢ Obedience to moral law for autonomous individuals is motivated by respect for the moral
law.

On the other hand, obedience to civil law is motivated by fear of punishment.

Thus, Ladd informs us that when one attaches "discipinary procedures, methods of adjudication and
sanctions, formal and informal, to the principles that one calls 'ethical' one automatically converts them
into legal rules or some other kind of authoritative rules of conduct...."(Ladd 131) Accompanying code
provisions with punishments replaces obedience based on respect for the (moral) law with conformity
based on fear of punishment.

115

â€¢ Codes lead to the dangerous tendency to reduce the ethical to the legal. Ethical principles
can be used to judge or evaluate a disciplinary or legal code. But the reverse is not true; existing laws
cannot trump ethical principles in debates over ethical issues and ethical decisions. As Ladd puts it,
"That is not to say that ethics has no relevance for projects involving the creation, certication and
enforcement of rules of conduct for members of certain groups....[I]ts [ethics's] role in connection with
these projects is to appraise, criticize and perhaps even defend (or condemn) the projects themselves,
the rules, regulations and procedures they prescribe, and the social and political goals and institutions
they represent." (Ladd 130)
â€¢ Codes have been used to justify immoral actions. Professional codes have been misued by
individuals to justify actions that go against common morality. For example, lawyers may use the fact
that the law is an adversarial system to justify lying. Ladd responds in the following way to this dodge:
"{T}here is no special ethics belonging to professionals. Professionals are not, simply because they
are professionals, exempt from the common obligations, duties and responsibilities that are binding on
ordinary people. They do not have a special moral status that allows them to do things that no one
else can." (Ladd 131)
Mischievous Side-Eects of Codes (from John Ladd)

â€¢ Codes make professionals complacent. (Ladd 135) First, they reduce the ethical to the minimally
acceptable. Second, they cover up wrongful actions or policies by calling themwithin the context
of the code"ethical". For example, the NSPE code of ethics used to prohibit competitive bidding.
Enshrining it in their code of ethics gave it the appearance of being ethical when in fact it was motivated
primarily by self interest. This provision was removed when it was declared unconstitutional by the
U.S. Supreme Court for violating the Anti-Trust law.
â€¢ Because codes focus on micro-ethical problems, "they tend to divert attention from macroethical problems of a profession." (Ladd 135) For example, in Puerto Rico, the actions of the
Disciplinary Tribunal of the Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico tend to focus on
individual engineers who violate code provisions concerned with individual acts of corruption; these
include conicts of interest, failing to serve as faithful agents or trustees, and participating in corrupt
actions such as taking or giving bribes. On the other hand, the CIAPR does not place equal attention
on macro-ethical problems such as "the social responsibilities of professionals as a group" (Ladd 132),
the role of the profession and its members in society (Ladd 135), and the "role professions play in
determining the use of technology, its development and expansion, and the distribution of the costs."
(Ladd 135)

4.1.11 Exercise: Questions for Reection
1. Which of Ladd's criticisms apply to the Pirate Creed?
2. How does your group's code of ethics stand in relation to Ladd's criticisms?
3. Do Ladd's objections apply t the ABET, NSPE, or CIAPR codes?

4.2 Developing Ethics Codes and Statements of Values2
4.2.1 Module Introduction
Codes of ethics evoke opposite reactions from people who teach, do research in, or are practitioners of
occupational and professional ethics. Some hold that teaching codes of ethics is essential to preparing students
for their future careers. Corporations, for example, have come to view codes as the cornerstone of a successful
compliance program. Professional societies, such as the Puerto Rico State Society of Professional
Engineers and Land Surveyors, also make the drafting, revising, and disseminating professional codes
of ethics a central part of practicing professional engineering ethics. But many strongly opppose codes
because they promote the wrong sorts of attitudes in those who would be inuenced by them. As you will
see below, philosophical ethicists raise objections to codes because they undermine moral autonomy, lead to
uncritical acceptance of authority, and replace moral motives with fear of punishment. These polar stances
are grounded in the very dierent perspectives from which dierent groups approach codes. But they are
also grounded in the fact that codes take many dierent forms and serve distinct functions. For example,
consider the introductory considerations presented in the following:
4.2.1.1 Dierent Uses for Codes
Kinds of Codes

â€¢ Professional Codes of Ethics. Professions such as engineering and accounting have developed codes
of ethics. These set forth the ideals of the profession as well as more mundane challenges faced by
members. Engineering codes, for example, set forth service to humanity as an ideal of the profession.
But they also provide detailed provisions to help members recognize conicts of interest, issues of
collegiality, and condentiality responsibilities.
â€¢ Corporate Codes of Ethics. Corporate codes are adopted by many companies to respond better
to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. These codes provide guidelines on particularly sticky issues
(When does a gift become a bribe?) They also set forth provisions that express the core values
of the corporation. These lengthy codes with detailed provisions support a compliance approach to
organizational discipline.
â€¢ Corporate Credos. Some companies have shortened their lengthy codes into a few general provisions
that form a creed. Johnson and Johnson's Credo is famous in this respect and can be found by clicking
on the Business Ethics Library link provided above.

117

â€¢ Statements of Values. Finally, more mature companies nd it useful to express and disseminate
their core value commitments in Statements of Values. These form the basis of values-based decisionmaking. While codes of ethics clearly establish minimum standards of acceptable conduct, Statements
of Values outline the aspirations that can drive companies toward continuous improvement.
Functions or Purposes Served by Codes

â€¢ Discipline. This function gets all the attention. Most codes are set forth to establish clearly and
forcefully an organization's standards, especially its minimum standards of acceptable conduct. Having
established the limits, organizations can then punish those who exceed them.
â€¢ Educate. This can range from disseminating standards to enlightening members. Company A's
employees learned that anything over $100 was a bribe and should not be accepted. But engineers
learn that their fundamental responsibility is to hold paramount public safety, health, and welfare.
Codes certainly teach minimum standards of conduct, but they can help a community to articulate
and understand their highest shared values and aspirations.
â€¢ Inspire. Codes can set forth ideals in a way that inspires a community's members to strive for
excellence. They can be written to set forth the aspirations and value commitments that express a
community's ideals. They can point a community toward moral excellence.
â€¢ Stimulate Dialogue. Engineering professional codes of ethics have changed greatly over the last
150 years. This has been brought about by a vigorous internal debate stimulated by these very
codes. Members debate controversial claims and work to rene more basic statements. Johnson and
Johnson credits their credo for their proactive and successful response to the Tylenol crisis. Regularly,
employees "challenge the credo" by bringing up dicult cases and testing how eectively the credo
guides decision-making and problem-solving. The CIAPR's Disciplinary Tribunal cases have served as
a focus for discussions on how to interpret key provisions of the organization's code of ethics. The NSPE
Board of Ethical Review decisions have also provided an excellent forum for clarifying ethical concepts
(public safety, conict of interest) in the context of cases brought to the board by NSPE members. The
BER discusses cases in terms of relevant provisions of the NSPE code. Over the years, the NSPE BER
has established a rm foundation for the resolution of dicult ethical cases by developing analogies
with cases it has already discussed and claried.
â€¢ Empower and Protect. Codes empower and protect those who are committed to doing the right
thing. If an employer orders an employee to do something that violates that employee's ethical or
professional standards, the code provides a basis for saying, "No!". Engineers have refused to carry
out directives that place in jeopardy the health and safety of the public based on statements like
canon 1 of the CIAPR code. (The NSPE code has similar provisions.) Because codes establish and
disseminate moral standards, they can provide the structure to convert personal opinion into reasoned
professional judgment. To reiterate, they provide support to those who would do the right thing, even
under when there is considerable pressure to do the opposite.
â€¢ Codes capture or express a community's identity. They provide the occasion to identify, foster
commitment, and disseminate the values with which an organization wants to be identied publicly.
These values enter into an organization's core beliefs and commitments forming an identify-conferring
system. By studying the values embedded in a company's code of ethics, observing the values actually
displayed in the company's conduct, and looking for inconsistencies, the observer can gain insight into
the core commitments of that company. Codes express values that, in turn, reveal a company's core
commitments, or (in the case of a hypocritical organization) those values that have fallen to the wayside
as the company has turned to other value pursuits.
Diculties with Codes

â€¢ The following objections lead philosophers to argue that presenting codes of ethics in ethics classes
undermines several key moral attitudes and practices.
â€¢ Codes can undermine moral autonomy by habituating us to act from motives like deference to external
authority and fear of punishment. We get out of the habit of making decisions for ourselves and fall
into the habit of deferring to outside authority.

CHAPTER 4.

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

â€¢ Codes often fail to guide us through complex situations. Inevitably, gaps arise between general rules and
the specic situations to which they are applied; concrete situations often present new and unexpected
challenges that rules, because of their generality, cannot anticipate. Arguing that codes should provide
action recipes for all situations neglects the fact that eective moral action requires more than just
blind obedience to rules.
â€¢ Codes of ethics can encourage a legalistic attitude that turns us away from the pursuit of moral excellence and toward just getting by or staying out of trouble. For example, compliance codes habituate
us to striving only to maintain minimum standards of conduct. They fail to motivate and direct action
toward aspirations. Relying exclusively on compliance codes conveys the idea that morality is nothing
but staying above the moral minimum.
This module is designed to steer you through these complex issues by having you draft a Statement of
Values for students at your university. As you work through your Statement of Values, you will learn that
codes have strengths and weaknesses, serve dierent functions, and embody values. To get you started in
this process, you will study a defective code, the Pirate Credo. A quick glance is all that is needed to see
that codes are "all too human" and need to be approached critically. In a second activity you will identify
the values embedded in professional, corporate, and academic codes. Working with these values, you will
develop a list upon which your group will build its own Statement of Values in a third activity. Finally, you
will construct value proles that include a general description, sample provisions, value-based challenges,
and value principles. These will all contribute to motivating those in your community to commit to and
work in concert to realize these values.

4.2.2 How an academic community developed a Statement of Values
A False Start

The faculty of the Arts and Sciences College of University X decided to form a committee to write a code
of ethics. This committee met several times during the course of an academic semester to prepare the rst
draft. When they nished, they circulated copies throughout the college. Then they held a series of pubic
hearings where interested members of the College could criticize the code draft. These were lightly attended
and those attending had only a few suggestions for minor changes. However, when the code was placed
before the faculty for approval, considerable opposition emerged. For example, a provision discouraging
faculty from gossiping was characteized by opponents as an attempt by a hostile College administration,
working through the committee, to eliminate faculty free speech. Several opponents expressed opposition to
the very idea of a code of ethics. "Does the administration think that our faculty is so corrupt," they aked,
"that the only hope for improvement is to impose upon them a set of rules to be mindlessly followed and
ruthlessly enforced?" At the end of this debate, the faculty overwhelmingly rejected the code.
Reections on "A False Start"

â€¢ Should codes of ethics be democratically developed from the "bottom up" or should they be authoritatively imposed from the "top down?" Or does this depend on certain characteristics of the community?
Maybe corporate managers should have lawyers draft their codes to meet the Federal Sentencing Guidelines; these completed codes should then be implemented throughout the company at all levels. Maybe
academic communities should democratically determine their own codes, and if they are unable to do
so, then so much the worse for the "very idea" of a code of ethics.
â€¢ The Ethics of Team Work module presents three ways that lead groups to go o the tracks: Group
Polarization, Groupthink, and "Going to Abilene." Do you think that any of these would explain false
starts in developing a code of ethics? How can these group pitfalls be overcome?
â€¢ Groups are often polarized around dierent and conicting ideologies or paradigms. Thomas Kuhn
discusses paradigms in the context of scientic debates. When these debates are fueled by conicting
and incompatible paradigms, they can turn acrimonious and prove extraordinarily dicult to resolve.
For Kuhn, paradigms articulate and encapsulate dierent world views; the meanings and experiences
shared by one group operating under one paradigm are often not shared by those operating under
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

119
dierent paradigms. Members of the Arts and Sciences faculty of University X may have disagreed
about the provisions proscribing gossiping because they were operating under dierent conceptual
systems brought about by incommensurable paradigms. If faculty members assumed dierent meanings
for 'gossiping', 'code', and 'discipline', then this would fuel the polarization of non-agreement like that
which occurred at University X.
â€¢ Cass Sunstein proposes that communities work around ideological or paradigm-driven disputes by developing, in special circumstances, "incompletely theorized agreements." These agreements are brought
about by bracketing commitments to a given ideology or paradigm. This allows one side to work on
understanding the other instead of marshaling arguments to defend the set of views entailed by its
paradigm. So Sunstein's recommendation to the College of Arts and Sciences of University X would
be to suspend commitment to defending the core beliefs of the conicting ideologies and try to hold
discussions at a more concrete, incompletely theorized level. This makes nding common ground easier. When shared understandings are forged, then they can serve as bridges to more complex, more
completely theorized positions.
â€¢ Looking at this problem from a completely dierent angle, do codes of ethics require a background of
trust? If so, how can trust be built up from within highly diverse and highly polarized communities or
groups?
â€¢ Finally, can codes of ethics be abused by more ruthless groups and individuals? For example, as those
in the College of Arts and Sciences claimed, can codes of ethics be used by those in positions of power
to strengthen that power and extend control over others?
A Success Story

â€¢ Three years later at the same university, another faculty group set out to construct a code of ethics in
order to respond to accreditation requirements. They began with the idea of constructing a stakeholder
code.
â€¢ First, they identied the stakeholders of the college's activities, that is, groups or individuals who had
a vital interest in that community's actions, decisions and policies.
â€¢ Second, they identied the goods held by each of these stakeholders which could be vitally impacted
by the actions of the college. For example, education represented the key good held by students that
could be vitally impacted by the activities and decisions of the College.
â€¢ Working from each stakeholder relation and the good that characterized that relation, members of the
college began crafting code provisions. Some set forth faculty duties such as keeping regular oce
hours, grading fairly, and keeping up to date in teaching and research. Others emphasized student
duties such as working responsibly and eectively in work teams, adhering to standards of academic
honesty, and attending classes regularly.
Because stakeholder codes embody a community's values, the individuals in charge of drafting the code
decided that a more direct approach would be to identify the embodied values and rene them into a
Statement of Values. This formal statement could later be developed in dierent directions including a more
detailed compliance code.
Turning their eorts toward preparing a Statement of Value Process, the Business Administration community went through the following steps:
1. They discussed a awed document, the Pirate Credo. This brought about three positive results:
participants came to see how codes embody values, that codes serve dierent functions, and that codes
clarify relations between the insiders and outsiders of a community.
2. Participants examined "bona de" codes of ethics such as academic codes, codes of honor, corporate
codes, and professional codes. Since codes embody values, they developed lists of the values these
codes embodied.
3. The sample provisions crafted in the earlier stakeholder code eort were presented so that participants
could identify the values these embodied. Previous eorts in developing a stakeholder code could be
benchmarked against the codes studied in the previous step. Convergences and divergences were noted

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

and used to further characterize the college's community in terms of its similarities and dierences
with other communities.
In this step, faculty members were asked to reduce the values list to a manageable number of ve to
seven. This led to the most contentious part of the process. Participants disagreed on the conception
of value, the meaning of particular values like justice, and on whether rights could be treated as values.
To resolve this disagreement, discussion leaders proposed using ballots to allow participants to vote
on values. This process was more than a simple up or down vote. Participants also ranked the values
under consideration.
After the top ve values were identied, eorts were made, in describing each of the remaining values,
to nd places to include at least components of the values left out. For example, while condentiality
was not included in the nal value list, it was reintegrated as a component of the more general value
of respect. Thus, the nal values list could be made more comprehensive and more acceptable to the
faculty community by reintegrating some values as parts of other, more general values. Another way
of picking up values left behind in the voting process was to combine values that shared signicant
content. Values that did not make it into the nal list were still noted with the provision that they
could be integrated into subsequent drafts of the Statement of Values.
A committee was formed to take each value through a value template. After describing the value,
they formulated a principle summarizing the ethical obligations it entailed, crafted sample provisions
applying the value, and posed dierent challenges the value presented to help guide a process of
continuous improvement.
The committee presented its results to the faculty who approved this rst draft Statement of Values
The faculty then developed a schedule whereby the Statement of Values would be revisited, expanded,
revised, and improved.

4.2.3 Textbox 1: Responding to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines
Recent eorts to develop ethics codes in the academic context for both students and faculty may, in part,
stem from the success of ethics compliance programs developed in business and industry in response to
the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Organizational codes of ethics have been integrated alongside other
compliance structure and activities to prevent criminal behavior, to detect criminal behavior, and to ensure
prompt and eective organizational response once such behavior has been detected.
The following section contains short exerpts from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. For more
details consult the materials referenced in note 5 below.

â€¢ "The hallmark of an eective program to prevent and detect violations of law is that the organization
exercised due diligence in seeking to prevent and detect criminal conduct by its employees and other
agents. Due giligence requires at a minimum that the organization must have taken the following types
of steps:
â€¢ The organization must have established compliance standards and procedures to be followed by ite
employees and other agents that are reasonably capable of reducing the prospect of criminal conduct.
â€¢ Specic individual(s) within high levelpersonnel of the organization must have been assigned overall
responsibility to oversee compliance with such standards and procedures.
â€¢ The organization must have used due care not to delegate substantial discretionary authority to individuals whom the organization knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, had
a propensity to engage in illegal activities.
â€¢ The organization must have taken steps to communicate eectively its standards and procedures to all
employees and other agents, e.g., by requiring participation in training programs or by disseminating
publications that explain in a practical manner what is required.
â€¢ The organization must have taken reasonable steps to achieve compliance with its standards, e.g.,
by utilizing monitoring and auditing systems reasonably designed to detect criminal conduct by its

121
empoyees and other agents and by having in place and publicizing a reporting system whereby employees and other agents could report criminal conduct by others within the organization without fear
of retribution.
Recommendations by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for an Eective Compliance Program

â€¢ Appointing individuals to serve as ethics or compliance ocers
â€¢ Developing corporate credos and codes of ethics that eectively communicate an organization's ethical
standards and expectations to employees.
â€¢ Designing ethics training programs for all employees
â€¢ Designing and implementing monitoring and auditing systems
â€¢ Designing and implementing an eective system of punishments and sanctions. These must be accompanied by investigative procedures that respect employee due process rights.

4.2.4 Textbox 2: Compliance Oriented Codes and Programs Versus Values Oriented Codes and Programs
Compliance Strategy

1. The initial and still probably the most prevalent method for responding to the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines is the compliance strategy. This strategy is based on three interrelated components:
2. Rules: Compliance strategies are centered around strict codes of ethics composed of rules that set
forth minimum thresholds of acceptable behavior. The use of rules to structure employee action does
run into problems due to the gap between rule and application, the appearance of novel situations, and
the impression that it gives to employees that obedience is based on conformity to authority.
3. Monitoring: The second component consists of monitoring activities designed to ensure that employees are conforming to rules and to identify instances of non-compliance. Monitoring is certainly
eective but it requires that the organiztion expend time, money, and energy. Monitoring also places
stress upon employees in that they are aware of constantly being watched. Those under observation
tend either to rebel or to automatically adopt behaviors they believe those doing the monitoring want.
This considerably dampens creativity, legitimate criticism, and innovation.
4. Disciplining Misconduct: The last key component to a compliance strategy is punishment. Punishment can be eective especially when establishing and enforcing conduct that remains above the
criminal level. But reliance on punishment for control tends to impose solidarity on an organization
rather than elicit it. Employees conform because they fear sanction. Organizations based on this fear
are never really free to pursue excellence.
Values Orientation

1. To facilitate comparison, three correlative but dierent elements to Values-Based or aspirationnal
approaches will be identied.
2. Development of Shared Values: Using a process similar to the one described above, a company
develops a Statement of Shared Values. These provide guidelines that replace the hard and fast rules of
a compliance code. Statements in values-oriented codes play a dierent logical function than statements
in compliance codes. "Principles of Professional/Organizational Conduct" in compliance codes specify
circumstances of compliance: time, agent, place, purpose, manner, etc. These provide sucient content
to set forth principles of professional conduct as rules that can be violated. This, in turn, allows them
to be backed by punishment for violation. "Ideals of the Profession (or organization) set forth a
community's shared aspirations. These are pitched at a level well above and beyond the minimum.
Communities can and should dene themselves as much by their aspirations as by their threshold
standards.

CHAPTER 4.

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

3. Support for Employees: Since Statements of Values set forth excellences or aspirations, the role of
the organization changes from monitoring and then punishing misbehavior to nding ways of opening
avenues for employees to realize key values in their day to day activity. Excellence is not something to
be reached overnight. It requires rethinking basic motivations, attitudes, beliefs, and goals. Companies
need to identify obstacles to achieving ideals and then develop support structures to help those who
seek to realize ideals. Values-based approaches change from punishing conduct that falls below the
minimum to providing collective support to those who strive for the excellent.
4. Locking in on Continual Improvement: The philosopher, John Dewey, characterizes moral responsibility as the drive to better ourselves. The particular twist in Dewey's approach is to nd ways of
folding what has been learned from the past into meeting new challenges that arise in the future. This
involves changing habits and, ultimately, changing character. Continual improvement is the ultimate
goal of corporations oriented toward excellence. The values these moral ecologies identify structure
and channel this endeavor. What is needed at this stage is to develop concrete programs and strategies
for identifying obstacles to excellence, removing them, and remaining on track for excellence.
5. To summarize, some companies identify a compliance strategy where they set forth rules that establish minimum levels of acceptable conduct, monitor compliance, and punish non-compliance. Others, value-oriented or aspiration-oriented companies, identify core values or aspirations (by reecting
on community values and nding them embedded in extant codes of ethics), develop programs and
structures to support those who strive for these values, and work to lock in a program of continual
improvement or betterment.
6. Something to think about. Compliance approaches work best in what of company, organization
or moral ecology. (Think about this in terms of the central or core commitments such as those in
nance-, customer-, and quality-driven companies.) Values-based approaches work best in what kind
of company, organization or moral ecology? How does one transition from compliance to values-based
approaches? How does one integrate the two?

4.2.5 Exercise 1: Evaluating the Pirate Credo
Read the Pirate Credo. Then answer the following questions individually

â€¢ What is good about the Pirate Credo?
â€¢ What is bad about the Pirate Credo?
â€¢ What is the purpose served by the Pirate Credo? For the Pirate Community? For non-members?

4.2.6 Exercise 2: Statement of Value Challenge
â€¢ Is the SOV comprehensive? (For example, can you think of a case that it does not adequately cover?
Are there values that it leaves out in the sense that they cannot be subsumed by one or more SOVs?
â€¢ Are the value descriptions clear? For example, if you have confused values on the multiple choice or
matching sections of your exams, is this because the descriptions need reworking and clarifying?
â€¢ Last year, an ADEM stakeholder group suggested that values should be paired with one another. For
example because integrity is a meta-value it should be paired with other values like trust. Or should
trust and responsibility be paired with one another. In this case, should the SOV be expanded to
explore the relations between dierent values?
â€¢ When ADEM stakeholders identied their values in 2005, they prioritized and ranked them. Justice
was ranked highest followed by responsibility, respect, trust, and integrity. Should this hierarchy or
ranking be changed? For example, last year stakeholders suggested that integrity should be ranked
rst because it is a meta-value that talks about the relation between other values.

4.2.7 Exercise 3: Developing Corporate Codes of Ethics
1. Ethics Bowl Corporations. You have been assigned corporations corresponding to two of the six ethics
bowl cases. For your presenting corporation, you will be developing a partial code of ethics. For the
commenting corporation, you need to familiarize yourself with the moral ecology of the corporation,
its needs, and be ready to comment on the code oered by another group.
2. What kind of moral ecology is predominate in your corporation? Is it nancial-, customer-, or qualitydriven. Look at how the type of moral ecology structures other organizational activities: allocation
of praise and blame, exchange of information, treatment of dissenting opinions, and central of moral
concerns. All of these issues need to be addressed directly or indirectly in your code.
3. What is the ethical challenge that is highlighted in the ethics bowl scenario based on your case. For
this information go to the "Ethics Bowl in the Environment of the Organization" module. m21191.
4. What functions are you addressing in your code outline? Looking above, these would include educate,
inspire, create dialogue, discipline, empower, secure and express identity.
5. Develop within the time available a sketch of a code. This could be a section of a compliance code, a
corporate credo, or a statement of values. In choosing your form, think carefully about the function(s)
of your code. Have something that you can present, informally, for around 3 to 5 minutes.

4.2.8 Exercise 4: Evaluating Bona Fide Codes of Ethics
Form small work teams of four to ve individuals. Carry out the following fours steps and
report your results to the rest of the group.

1.
2.
3.
4.

Review a few sample codes per team.
List the values you identify in the codes.
Identify any recurring values.
Record and post the list of values.

Express each value as a word or in as few words as possible.

4.2.9 Exercise 5: Do a Statement of Values for Students at Your University
In this third exercise, work with your group to develop a rened list of ve to seven values.
You can rene your list by integrating or synthesizing values, grouping specic values under
more general ones, and integrating values into others as parts. Do your best to make your list
comprehensive and representative.

1. Brainstorm: list the values for your group. Keep in mind that values are multi-dimensional. For
example, in the academic context, the values will break down into dimensions corresponding to stakeholder: faculty, students, administration, and other academic stakeholders.
2. Rene: reduce your list to a manageable size (5-7). Do this by rewording, synthesizing, combining,
and eliminating.
3. Post: share your list with the entire group.
4. Revise: make any last minute changes.
5. Combine: a moderator will organize the lists into a ballot
6. Vote: Each person ranks the top ve values

4.2.10 Exercise 6Conveying Our Values: Crafting a Values-Based Code
Each value in your Statement of Values needs to be accompanied by a Value Prole. Give a
description of the value in everyday, non-technical terms. Think concretely. For example, those
who exemplify your value behave in a certain fashion, exhibit certain commitments, pursue

certain projects, and show certain attitudes and emotions. Try to think of general guidelines to
keep in mind when working to realize your value. Finally, values challenge us because portray
our aspirations. Think of specic ways values challenge us. For example, students may set for
themselves the challenge of working responsibly in teams. They can further spell out what
kinds of actions and attitudes this might require. Faculty members might set for themselves
the challenge of grading more fairly. This could require actions like developing rubrics and
rening exams to make them clearer. The purpose of this fourth exercise is to provide content
to your statement of values and begin its implementation in your community. The following
steps ennumerated below will help.

This exercise provides you an opportunity to study and discuss the UPRM College of Business Administration
Statement of Values (available via the PREREQUISITE LINKS). Your task consists of the following tasks:

â€¢ Read the entire UPRM CBA Statement of Values (individually)
â€¢ Discuss the particular section/value assigned to your group and briey describe what commitments or
challenges does this value present for the students, faculty and/or sta of the CBA
â€¢ List the most important commitments or challenges as precise and concise principles

4.2.12 Exercise 8: Assessing the UPRM College of Business Administration
Statement of Values
This exercise oers four scenarios in academic integrity. Your job is to discuss each scenario in terms of
the values listed in the UPRM College of Business Administration Statement of Values (available via the
PREREQUISITE LINKS).
Marta Acevedo, a business administration student, has a report due tomorrow. She has been
overwhelmed for the last few weeks with assignments from other classes and doesn't really
have time to complete this exercise. She discovers that her roommate took this same class
the previous semester and has a complete report on disk. She considers using her roommate's

changes in style in student papers. Its new search engine quickly connects to existing online
paper data bases, greatly expanding the ability of a professor to detect the sources from which
their students have copied. Furthermore, it allows professors to upload papers and projects
from past semesters and provides fast and exible indexing to help them identify recycled student work. Professors can zero in on students using recycled papers, and the former students
who have become their suppliers. Following the recent lead of Ohio State University, you can
now revoke the degrees of past students who participate in this version of academic dishonesty.
In short, this new and exciting software package allows you to monitor the work of present
and past students to a degree thought impossible even in the recent past. Plagiarism, your
colleague tells you, will now become a thing of the past.

â€¢ Does this anti-plagiarism program threaten any of the values in the ADEM SOV? If so, which values?
â€¢ Is the department chairperson treating students disrespectfully by adopting and implementing the antiplagiarism software? Can faculty treat students disrespectfully as "justiable" retaliation for student
cheating and plagiaring? Do two wrongs make a right?
â€¢ What is the cause of plagiarism? Do students do it out of ignorance of standards and practices of
documentation and achnowledgment? Do they do it because they procrastinate until they do not have
time to do the assignment properly? Do students resort to plagiarism because they have too many
conicting obligations such as family, job, large course loads, etc.?
You teach an advanced course in Engineering Economics that has both graduate and undergraduate students. At the end of the semester the students turn in a group project that
comprises 40% of their grade. One of the groups complains to you that only 4 out of the 5
members have done any work. The fth student, the one who allegedly has done no work, is
an undergraduate. The others are graduate students. You talk with the undergraduate who
claimed that she tried to involve herself in the group activities but was excluded because she
was an undergraduate. What should you do?

â€¢ ADEM faculty have identied students not working together eectively in groups as a major concern.
Do you nd this a problem? What do you think are the causes of students not participating eectively
in work groups?
â€¢ Assume that the teacher in this case is committed to implementing the ADEM SOV. Which values are
at play in this case? Design an action for the teacher that realizes these values?
â€¢ Assume you are a member of this student work group. What can groups do to ensure that every member
is able to participate fully? What do group members do to exclude individuals from participating?
You are studying frantically for your exam in a computer engineering course. It will be very
dicult. But your roommate, who is also taking the course and has the exam tomorrow, seems
unconcerned. When you ask why, he tells you that he has a copy of the exam. Apparently,
a group of students in the class found out how to hack into the professor's computer and
download the exam. (They installed a Trojan horse called Sub-Seven into the professor's
computer which allows unauthorized access; then they searched through the professor's les,
found the exam and downloaded it.) Your roommate has the exam in his hand and asks you
if you would like to look at it. What should you do?

â€¢ A group of students in a computer ethics class created a survey that asked students if they would
avail themselves of exams obtained through means such as that described in the scenario above. Sixty
percent of the respondents said that they would. Compare this to the value commitments expressed in
the ADEM SOV? Is there a gap between aspiration and behavior? What can be done to reduce this
gap?
â€¢ Suppose you took the exam. Would this have any long term eects on your character? Would acting
dishonestly this time make it easier to do so in the future?

4.3 Gray Matters for the Hughes Aircraft Case4
4.3.1 Introduction
I. Introduction

The Hughes Aircraft Case involves a group of employees in charge of testing chips for weapons systems.
Because of the lengthy testing procedure required by the U.S. Defense Department, Hughes soon fell behind
schedule in delivering chips to customers. To get chips out faster, some Hughes middle level managers
began to put pressure on employees to pass chips that had failed tests or to pass them without testing.
The scenarios below consist of narratives that stop at the point of decision. Your job is to complete the
narrative by making a decision. Alternatives are provided to get the process started, but you may nd it
necessary to design your own solution. Ethics and feasibility tests help you to evaluate these alternatives
and even design new ones more to your liking. This format supercially resembles the Gray Matters exercise
used at Boeing Corporation. (More information on the history of Gray Matters can be found by consulting

Bibliographical Note

The six scenarios below were developed by Chuck Hu as Participant Perspectives. They were rst published
online through the Computing Cases website. (Computing Cases was developed through two National Science
Foundation grants, DUE-9972280 and DUE-9980768.) A revised version of these participant perspectives
has been published in the anthology, Whistleblowing: Perspectives and Experiences, edited by Reena
Raj and published in 2008 by the Icfai University Press, Nagarjuna Hills, Punjagutta, Hyderbad, India.
These materials can be found on pages 75-80.
Scenario One: Responding to Organizational Pressure

Frank Saia has worked at Hughes Aircraft for a long time. Now he is faced with the most dicult decisions of
his career. He has been having problems in the environmental testing phase of his microchip manufacturing
plant; the detailed nature of these tests has caused Hughes to be consistently late in delivering the chips to
customers. Because of the time pressure to deliver chips, Saia has been working to make the production of
chips more ecient without losing the quality of the product. Chips are manufactured and then tested, and
this provides two places where the process can bottle up. Even though you might have a perfectly ne chip
on the oor of the plant, it cannot be shipped without testing. And, since there are several thousand other
chips waiting to be tested, it can sit in line for a long time. Saia has devised a method that allows testers to
put the important chips, the hot parts, ahead of the others without disrupting the ow and without losing
the chips in the shue. He has also added a gross leak test that quickly tells if a chip in a sealed container
is actually sealed or not. Adding this test early in the testing sequence allows environmental testing to avoid
wasting time by quickly eliminating chips that would fail a more ne-grained leak test later in the sequence.
Because environmental testing is still falling behind, Saia's supervisors and Hughes customers are getting
angry and have begun to apply pressure. Karl Reismueller, the director of the Division of Microelectronics at
Hughes, has given Saia's telephone number to several customers, whose own production lines were shut down
awaiting the parts that Saia has had trouble delivering. His customers are now calling him directly to say
we're dying out here for need of parts. Frank Saia has discovered that an employee under his supervision,
Donald LaRue, has been skipping tests on the computer chips. Since LaRue began this practice, they have
certainly been more on time in their shipments. Besides, both LaRue and Saia know that many of the hot
parts are actually for systems in the testing phase, rather than for ones that will be put into active use. So
testing the chips for long-term durability that go into these systems seems unnecessary. Still, LaRue was
caught by Quality Control skipping a test, and now Saia needs to make a decision. Upper management has
provided no guidance; they simply told him to handle it and to keep the parts on time. He can't let LaRue
continue skipping tests, or at least he shouldn't let this skipping go unsupervised. LaRue is a good employee,
but he doesn't have the science background to know which tests would do the least damage if they were
skipped. He could work with LaRue and help him gure out the best tests to skip so the least harm is done.
But getting directly involved in skipping the tests would mean violating company policy and federal law.

1. Do nothing. LaRue has started skipping tests on his own initiative. If any problems arise, then LaRue
will have to take responsibility, not Saia, because LaRue was acting independently of and even against
Saia's orders.
2. Call LaRue in and tell him to stop skipping tests immediately. Then call the customers and explain
that the parts cannot be shipped until the tests are carried out.
3. Consult with LaRue and identify non essential chips or chips that will not be used in systems critical
to safety. Skipping tests on these chips will do the least damage.
4. Your solution. . ..
Scenario Two: Responding to Wrongdoing

Margaret Goodearl works in a supervisory position in the environmental testing group at Hughes Aircraft.
Her supervisor, Donald LaRue, is also the current supervisor for environmental testing. The group that
LaRue and Goodearl together oversee test the chips that Hughes makes in order to determine that they
would survive under the drastic environmental conditions they will likely face. Rigorous testing of the chips
is the ideal, but some chips (the hot chips) get in line ahead of others. Goodearl has found out that over
the last several months, many of these tests are being skipped. The reason: Hughes has fallen behind in the
production schedule and Hughes upper management and Hughes customers have been applying pressure to
get chip production and testing back on schedule. Moreover, LaRue and others feel that skipping certain
tests doesn't matter, since many of these chips are being used in systems that are in the testing phase, rather
than ones that will be put into active use. A few months after Margaret Goodearl started her new position,
she was presented with a dicult problem. One of the girls (the women and men in Environmental Testing
at Hughes), Lisa Lightner, came to her desk crying. She was in tears and trembling because Donald LaRue
had forcefully insisted that she pass a chip that she was sure had failed the test she was running. Lightner
ran the hermeticity test on the chips. The chips are enclosed in a metal container, and one of the questions
is whether the seal to that container leaks. From her test, she is sure that the chip is a leakerthe seal
is not airtight so that water and corrosion will seep in over time and damage the chip. She has come to
Goodearl for advice. Should she do what LaRue wants and pass a chip she knows is a leaker?
Alternatives

1. Goodearl should advise Lightner to go along with LaRue. He is her supervisor. If he orders to pass
the chip, then she should do so.
2. Goodearl should go to Human Resources with Lightner and le a harassment complaint against LaRue.
Skipping tests is clearly illegal and ordering an employee to commit an illegal act is harassment.
3. Goodearl and Lightner should blow the whistle. They should go to the U.S. defense department and
inform them of the fact that Hughes Aircraft is delivering chips that have either failed tests or have
not been tested.
4. Your solution. . ..
Scenario 3: Goodearl, Ibarra, and the AMRAAM Incident

Now that Goodearl had few sympathizers among upper management, she increasingly turned to Ruth Ibarra
in Quality assurance for support in her concerns about test skipping and the falsication of paperwork. One
day, Goodearl noticed that some AMRAAM chips with leak stickers were left on her project desk in the
environmental testing area. The leak stickers meant that the seal on the chips' supposedly airtight enclosure
had failed a test to see if they leaked. AMRAAM meant that the chips were destined to be a part of an
Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile. Goodearl knew that these parts could not be retested and
needed to be simply thrown away. So why was someone keeping them? She also knew that these were
ocially "hot parts" and that the company was behind schedule in shipping these parts. After consulting
with Ruth Ibarra, the two of them decided to do some sleuthing. They took the chips and their lot travelers
to a photocopy machine and made copies of the travelers with "failed" noted on the leak test. They then
replaced the chips and their travelers on the desk. Later that day, as Don LaRue passed the desk, Goodearl
asked Don LaRue if he knew anything about the chips. "None of your business," he replied. The chips
disappeared, and later the travelers showed up in company les with the "failed" altered to "passed." So,
Goodearl and Ibarra had clear evidence (in their photocopy of the "failed" on the traveler) that someone

was passing o failed chips to their customers. And these were important chips, part of the guidance system
of an air-to-air missile.
Alternatives: Since they have clear evidence, Goodearl and Ibarra should blow the whistle.
Evaluate each of the following ways in which they could blow the whistle

1. Blow the whistle to Hughes' Board of Directors. In this way they can stop the test skipping but will
also be able to keep the whole aair in house.
2. Blow the whistle to the local news media. In this way they will shame Hughes into compliance with
the testing requirements.
3. Take the evidence to the U.S. Department of Defense, since they are the client and are being negatively
impacted by Hughes' illegal actions.
4. Some other mode of blowing the whistle. . ..

Leaving out a key stakeholder relation.
Failing to recognize and address conicts between stakeholders and their conicting stakes.
Confusing treating others with respect with capitulating to their demands (Reversing with Hitler).
Failing to reach closure, i.e., an overall global reversal assessment that takes into account all the
stakeholders the agent has reversed with.

Public Identication Set-Up

â€¢ Set up the analysis by identifying the agent, describing the action under consideration, and listing the
key values or virtues at play in the situation.
â€¢ Associate the action with the agent.
â€¢ Identify what the action says about the agent as a person. Does it reveal him or her as someone
associated with a virtue/value or a vice?
Public Identication Pitfalls

1. Action is not associated with the agent. The most common pitfall is failure to associate the agent and
the action. The action may have bad consequences and it may treat individuals with disrespect but
these points are not as important in the context of this test as what they imply about the agent as a
person who deliberately performs such an action.
2. Failure to specify the moral quality, virtue, or value of the action that is imputed to the agent in the
test. To say, for example, that willfully harming the public is bad fails to zero in on precisely what
moral quality this attributes to the agent. Does it render him or her unjust, irresponsible, corrupt,
dishonest, or unreasonable?

The following presents the circumstances of compromise as laid down by Martin Benjamin in Splitting the
(See below for complete reference.) Benjamin provides ve conditions that indicate when a
compromise may be necessary. But he also argues that integrity helps draw a line beyond which compromise
must not go. One should not sacrice basic beliefs that constitute one's personal identity or self system.
A good example of using integrity to draw the line on compromise can be found in the characterization of
Thomas More in Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons. (See also the movie of the same name.) In the
preface to the play, Bolt explicitly presents what follows as an exercise in articulating and testing integrity.
Dierence.

More on Moral Complexity

Martin Benjamin in Splitting the Dierence quotes John Rawls on moral complexity: Diversity naturally
arises from our limited powers and distinct perspectives; it is unrealistic to suppose that all
our dierences are rooted in ignorance and perversity, or else in the rivalries that result from
scarcity. . ..Deep and unresolvable dierences on matters of fundamental signicance. . .[must
be acknowledged] as a permanent condition of human life.
Application of Circumstances of Compromise

â€¢ Factual Uncertainty. Where are the chips under consideration going? If they go to an essential
system in an operative technology, then their malfunctioning could lead to loss of life. If they go to a
non-essential system (like a prototype being tested) then maybe the testing process can be streamlined.
This may require compromise between Hughes management, chip-testing team, and customers.
â€¢ Moral Complexity: How should an employee like LaRue weigh his loyalty to supervisors and company
and his obligation to the public and client? Setting aside his harassment of Gooderal, is Saia's position
(or at least a part of it) morally defensible?
â€¢ Continuing cooperative relationship: How important should it be to Gooderal that she needs
to sustain her relationship with her supervisor, LaRue, for the long term? How important is it that
Hughes managers respond to dicult messages rather than attempt to "shoot the messenger." (Again,
thinking in terms of continuing cooperative relationship?)
â€¢ Decision cannot be deferred: Why is it impossible to defer the decision on whether to respond to
test skipping? This case poses several dicult constraints. How many of these can be "pushed back"
through negotiation? Could Saia use his newly found accessibility to customers to negotiate with them
an extension on the delivery deadlines?
â€¢ Scarcity of resources: How are the resources of time, personnel, and money scarce in this case?
Is there any way to push back these constraints by negotiating more time (extending deadlines for
delivering chips), personnel (bringing in additional people to test chips), and resources (developing
better tools to test chips more quickly). Could, for example, it be possible to transfer Hughes employees
from other areas to help out, temporarily, on chip testing?
Ethical Dissent

1. Establish a clear technical foundation.
2. Keep your arguments on a high professional plane, as impersonal and objective as possible, avoiding
extraneous issues and emotional outbursts.
3. Try to catch problems early, and keep the argument at the lowest managerial level possible.
4. Before going out on a limb, make sure that the issue is suciently important.

When the rst three conditions are satised, whistle-blowing is morally permissible. (You may do
it but you are not required or obligated to do it.) This is because you have brought your concerns
before decision-makers, given them a chance to respond, and, in the face of their unwillingness to do
so, still nd the issue of great importance.
7. When all ve conditions are satised, then whistle-blowing becomes morally obligatory. In this
case, you have a moral duty to blow the whistle. Here, your duty is grounded in your responsibility to
inform those who are likely to be harmed by the wrongdoing.

4.3.7 Hughes Dramatic Rehearsals
A note on dramatic rehearsals

â€¢ The notion of dramatic rehearsal comes from John Dewey's Human Nature and Moral Conduct.
An agent works through a solution alternative in the imagination before executing it in the real world.
The dramatic rehearsal tests the idea in a mental laboratory created by the moral imagination. Steven
Fesmire in his book, John Dewey and Moral Imagination: Pragmatism in Ethics (Indiana
University Press, 2003), provides a comprehensive interpretation of Dewey's suggestive idea.
â€¢ The scenarios portrayed below reect events in the case but some changes have been made to create
six focused decision points. For a more accurate portrayal of the case events, see Computing Cases
(computingcases.org)
4.3.7.1 Decision Point One
Decision Point One

â€¢ Frank Saia has worked at Hughes Aircraft for a long time. Now he is faced with the most dicult
decisions of his career. He has been having problems in the environmental testing phase of his microchip
manufacturing plant; the detailed nature of these tests has caused Hughes to be consistently late in
delivering the chips to customers.
â€¢ Because of the time pressure to deliver chips, Saia has been working to make the production of chips
more ecient without losing the quality of the product. Chips are manufactured and then tested, and
this provides two places where the process can bottle up. Even though you might have a perfectly
ne chip on the oor of the plant, it cannot be shipped without testing. And, since there are several
thousand other chips waiting to be tested, it can sit in line for a long time. Saia has devised a method
that allows testers to put the important chips, the hot parts, ahead of the others without disrupting
the ow and without losing the chips in the shue. He has also added a gross leak test that quickly
tells if a chip in a sealed container is actually sealed or not. Adding this test early in the testing
sequence allows environmental testing to avoid wasting time by quickly eliminating chips that would
fail a more ne-grained leak test later in the sequence.
â€¢ Because environmental testing is still falling behind, Saia's supervisors and Hughes customers are
getting angry and have begun to apply pressure. Karl Reismueller, the director of the Division of
Microelectronics at Hughes, has given Saia's telephone number to several customers, whose own production lines were shut down awaiting the parts that Saia has had trouble delivering. His customers
are now calling him directly to say we're dying out here for need of parts.
Dialogue for Decision Point One

â€¢ Construct a dialogue in which Saia responds to the pressure from his supervisor, Karl Reismueller
â€¢ Be sure to address the customer complaints
4.3.7.2 Decision Point Two
Decision Point Two

â€¢ Frank Saia has discovered that an employee under his supervision, Donald LaRue, has been skipping
tests on the computer chips. Since LaRue began this practice, they have certainly been more on time
in their shipments. Besides, both LaRue and Saia know that many of the hot parts are actually
for systems in the testing phase, rather than for ones that will be put into active use. So testing the
chips for long-term durability that go into these systems seems unnecessary. Still, LaRue was caught
by Quality Control skipping a test, and now Saia needs to make a decision. Upper management has
provided no guidance; they simply told him to handle it and to keep the parts on time.

139

â€¢ He can't let LaRue continue skipping tests, or at least he shouldn't let this skipping go unsupervised.
LaRue is a good employee, but he doesn't have the science background to know which tests would do
the least damage if they were skipped. He could work with LaRue and help him gure out the best
tests to skip so the least harm is done. But getting directly involved in skipping the tests would mean
violating company policy and federal law.

Should Saia work with LaRue to identify tests that are not necessary and then have LaRue skip these?

the tests? Your rst item here

4.3.7.3 Decision Point Three
Decision Point Three

â€¢ Margaret Goodearl works in a supervisory position in the environmental testing group at Hughes
Aircraft. Her supervisor, Donald LaRue, is also the current supervisor for environmental testing.
The group that LaRue and Goodearl together oversee test the chips that Hughes makes in order to
determine that they would survive under the drastic environmental conditions they will likely face.
Rigorous testing of the chips is the ideal, but some chips (the hot chips) get in line ahead of others.
Goodearl has found out that over the last several months, many of these tests are being skipped.
The reason: Hughes has fallen behind in the production schedule and Hughes upper management and
Hughes customers have been applying pressure to get chip production and testing back on schedule.
Moreover, LaRue and others feel that skipping certain tests doesn't matter, since many of these chips
are being used in systems that are in the testing phase, rather than ones that will be put into active
use.
â€¢ A few months after Margaret Goodearl started her new position, she was presented with a dicult
problem. One of the girls (the women and men in Environmental Testing at Hughes), Lisa Lightner,
came to her desk crying. She was in tears and trembling because Donald LaRue had forcefully insisted
that she pass a chip that she was sure had failed the test she was running.
â€¢ Lightner ran the hermeticity test on the chips. The chips are enclosed in a metal container, and one
of the questions is whether the seal to that container leaks. From her test, she is sure that the chip
is a leakerthe seal is not airtight so that water and corrosion will seep in over time and damage
the chip. She has come to Goodearl for advice. Should she do what LaRue wants and pass a chip she
knows is a leaker?
Dialogue

â€¢ Construct a dialogue that acts out Goodearl's response to her knowledge that LaRue is regularly
skipping tests
â€¢ Should Goodearl rst talk directly to LaRue? What if he responds defensively?
â€¢ Should Goodearl go over LaRue's head and discuss his skipping the tests with one of his supervisors?
To whom should she go? How could she prepare for possible retaliation by LaRue? What should she
know before doing this?
â€¢ If LaRue or another supervisor should fail to respond to the test skipping, should Goodearl continue
responsible dissent or drop the issue (=nolo contendere)
â€¢ Could Goodearl not contend the issue but distance herself? (What if Hughes has no DPO procedure?)

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

4.3.7.4 Decision Point Four

Ruth Ibarra (from Quality Assurance) has seen Shirley Reddick resealing chips without the authorization
stamp. Ibarra has asked Goodearl to nd out what's going on. When Goodearl asks LaRue, he replies,
None of your damn business. Shortly after this, Gooderal receives a phone call from Jim Temple, one of
her superiors, telling her to come to his oce. Temple informs Goodearl in no uncertain terms that she needs
to back down. You are doing it again. You are not part of the team, running to Quality with every little
problem. When Goodearl insisted she did not run to Quality but Quality came to her, Temple replies,
Shape up and be part of the team if you want your job.
Dialogue

â€¢ Construct a dialogue in which Gooderal responds to this latest test skipping issue
â€¢ Consider these issues in constructing your dialogue:
â€¢ Goodearl had already confronted LaRue about test skipping when Lisa Lightner came to her. After
failing to get results, she had decided to drop the issue
â€¢ How should Goodearl respond to Temple? Should she continue pushing responsible dissent or give way
to Temple's threats?
4.3.7.5 Decision Point Five

â€¢ After her conversation with Temple, Goodearl goes to the Personnel Department to inquire into ling
a harassment complaint against her supervisors at Hughes
â€¢ After her discussion she sees the personnel ocial leave his oce and turn toward Frank Saia's oce,
one of Goodearl's supervisors.
â€¢ Goodearl is then called to Saia's oce. An angry Saia throws his glasses at her and threatens to re
her if she persists. He also asks her where she gets o ling a harassment charge against him.
Dialogue

â€¢ Construct a dialogue in which Gooderal reacts to Saia both during Saia's outburst and after it.
â€¢ Is Saia harassing Gooderal? (How do we dene harassing in this context?)
â€¢ How should Goodearl respond given that Saia's latest outburst was caused by the personnel ocial
reporting to him the condential meeting he had with Goodearl?
â€¢ What are Goodearl's options at this point? Are any of the strategies for responsible dissent we have
studied so far relevant or of use?
4.3.7.6 Decision Point Six
Decision Point Six

â€¢ Margaret Goodearl and Ruth Ibarra have made several attempts to get their supervisors to respond to
the problem of skipping the environmental tests. The general response has been to shoot the messenger
rather than respond to the message. Both Goodearl and Ibarra have been branded trouble makers and
told to mind their own business. They have been threatened with dismissal if they persist.
â€¢ So they have decided to blow the whistle, having exhausted all the other options. They initiated contact
with ocials in the U.S. government's Oce of the Inspector General. These ocials are interested
but have told Goodearl and Ibarra that they need to document their case.
â€¢ One day they nd two hybrids (chips that combine two dierent kinds of semiconductor devices on
a common substrate) on LaRue's desk. These chips which are destined for an air-to-air missile have
failed the leak test. It is obvious that LaRue plans on passing them without further testing during the
evening shift after Goodearl has gone home. Goodearl and Ibarra discuss whether this presents a good
opportunity to document their case for the Oce of the Inspector General.

141
Dialogue

â€¢ Construct an imaginary conversation between Goodearl and Ibarra where they discuss dierent strategies for documenting their concerns to the Oce of the Inspector General?
â€¢ Have them consider the following:
â€¢ By looking for documented evidence against their employer, have Goodearl and Ibarra violated their
duties of trust and condentiality?
â€¢ Some argue that before blowing the whistle, an employee should exhaust internal channels. Have
Goodearl and Ibarra discuss whether they can do anything more inside Hughes before taking evidence
outside
4.3.7.7 Questions on Dramatic Reections
Directions:

After you have acted out your decision point in the Hughes case, you and your group have two further
activities. First, you will answer the questions below to help you reect generally on the nature of dramatic
rehearsals and specically on recent dramatization. These ve questions (outlined in detail just below) ask
you to discuss your dramatic form, the form of responsible dissent you used, how the action you dramatized
fared with the three ethics tests, the value and interest conicts you dealt with, and the constraints that
bordered your decision point. Second, you will provide a storyboard that summarizes the drama you acted
out before class. This is also detailed just below.
As was said above, John Dewey suggested the idea that underlies these dramatic rehearsals or What-if
dramas. As Dewey puts it "[d]eliberation is actually an imaginative rehearsal of various courses
of conduct. We give way, in our mind, to some impulse; we try, in our mind, some plan.
Following its career through various steps, we nd ourselves in imagination in the presence of
the consequences that would follow: and as we then like and approve, or dislike and disapprove,
these consequences, we nd the original impulse or plan good or bad. Deliberation [becomes]
dramatic and active. . .." (Dewey, 1960, p. 135) Think of your "dramatic rehearsal" as an experiment

carried out in your imagination. The hypothesis is the alternative course of action decided upon by your
group that forms the basis of your "What-if" rehearsal. Imagine that you carry out your alternative in the
real world. What are its consequences? How are these distributed? How would each of the stakeholders in
your case view the action? How does this t in with your conception of a moral or professional career? Your
imagination is the laboratory in which you test the action your group devises as a hypothesis.
This quote will also help you understand the concept of dramatic rehearsal. It comes from John Gardner,
a famous novelist, and Mark Johnson, a theorist in moral imagination. John Gardner has argued that

ction is a laboratory in which we can explore in imagination the probable implications of
people's character and choices. He describes what he calls moral ction as a philosophical
method in which art controls the argument and gives it its rigor, forces the writer to intense
yet dispassionate and unprejudiced watchfulness, drives himin ways abstract logic cannot
matchto unexpected discoveries and, frequently, a change of mind. (Johnson, p. 197;
Gardner, p. 108).

There are dierent versions of what form dramatic form takes. In general there is plot, character, agon
(struggle or confronting obstacles), resolution, and closure. A drama is a narrative, an unfolding of related
events in time. One event arises to give way to another and so forth. Dramas can be driven by the ends of
the characters and the unfolding can be the realization or frustration of these activities. Dramatic rehearsals
take isolated actions and restore them to this context of dramatic form.
1. What is the dramatic form taken on by your enactment?

â€¢ Perhaps your drama is a comedy. Many groups have chosen this form but have found it hard to
explain why. How does comedy help your group to get its message across? What is its message?
â€¢ Some groups have approached this rehearsal as a tragedy where the good intentions and goals of
those involved all turned out bad. In many ways, this is how the case played out in reality. So, if your

CHANGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE

group chose tragedy, then it is important to state why there were no viable alternatives to the choices
actually made by the participants in the Hughes case. What constraints prevented the agents from
achieving their ends? (Look for more than just bad people here.)
Some groups decided to frame their rehearsal as a documentary Here a narrator describes and frames
the activities carried out by the dierent participants oering commentary and analysis.
Continuing with the documentary line, some groups have presented their drama as proceedings in a
trial where a judge presides over attorneys presenting the arguments from both sides. This approach
has the advantage of laying out the dierent perspectives but when the judge reaches a decision, it takes
on the risk of oversimplifying the case by making one side completely right and the other completely
wrong. The "winner takes all" interpretation of a court trial (guilty-innocent) often leaves out moral
complexity.
Some groups convert their dramas into Quixotic ventures where they "tilt at windmills." Here
they try to present scenarios where idealistic participants strive to realize their values over dicult,
constraining and harsh realities. The advantage of this approach is that it does not compromise on
values and ideals. The disadvantage is that it may underestimate elements in the real world that
oppose acting on the ideal. Realizing the "intermediate possible" may be the best route here.
Some groups approach their dramatizations as cautionary tales where they act out the harsh consequences that attend immoral, greedy, selsh, or corruption action. Here the world is constrained by
justice. Those who hubristically try to exceed these constraints are punished for their transgressions.
Cautionary tales are more moralistic than tragedies but, at some point, converge on this other dramatic
form.
You are, of course, encouraged to go beyond this list by inventing your own dramatic form or combining
those listed above to produce a new, synthetic form. The point here is that dramatic forms both lter
and structure elements of this complicated case. I am asking that you be deliberate and thoughtful
about how you work your way through the Hughes case. What did your dramatic form leave out? How
did it structure the drama dierently than other forms? Why did you choose the form you chose?

2. Your dramatic rehearsal also should test the three forms of responsible dissent we studied
this semester.

â€¢ Generic Forms of Dissent. Did your rehearsal test any of the generic forms of dissent such as gather
more information, nolo contendere, oppose diplomatically, oppose confrontationally, distance yourself,
or exit?
â€¢ Moral Compromise. Did your rehearsal deploy any of the strategies of moral compromise? For
example, referring to the Ethics of Teamwork, did it deploy bridging, logrolling, expanding the pie, or
non-specic compensation? Were you able to get things moving by negotiating interests rather than
person-based positions? What were the circumstances that elicited compromise? For example, does
the Hughes case display any "moral complexity?"
â€¢ Blowing the Whistle. If your drama followed the case and advocated blowing the whistle, provide a
justication using the class framework. For example, argue that whistleblowing was permissible or that
it was obligatory. To whom do your recommend blowing the whistle given the problems Ibarra and
Goodearl had with the Inspector General's oce? How would you recommend they go about gathering
documented evidence? What should they do before blowing the whistle? In short, do more, both in
your drama and in this reection, than just advocate the action. Describes the means, complexities,
and circumstances surrounding blowing the whistle on Hughes.
3. Outline your ethics experiment by examining the action you advocate using the three ethics
tests.

â€¢ Reversibility. How does your action look when you reverse with the key stakeholders? Project into
their shoes avoiding the extremes of too much identication and too little identication.
â€¢ Harm. What harms have you envisioned through your dramatic rehearsal? Are these harms less
quantitatively and qualitatively than the action actually taken in the case?
Available for free at Connexions <http://legacy.cnx.org/content/col10396/1.10>

143

â€¢ Publicity. Finally, project the action taken in your rehearsal into the career of a moral professional.
Is it consistent with this career or does it embrace (or neglect) values out of place in such a career. In
other words, carry out the publicity test by associating the values embedded in the action you portray
with the character of a good or moral agent carrying out a moral, professional career.
4. Value and interest conicts in your drama.

â€¢ All these decision points involve some kind of conict. How did you characterize this conict in your
dramatization? Pose your conict in terms of values. How did your drama "resolve" this value conict?
5. Recognizing and dealing with the constraints you found in your decision point.

These drama/decision points had dierent kinds and degrees of constraints. Early decision points have fewer
constraints than later because the earlier decisions both condition and constrain those that follow. Here is
another issue you may need to address. Your feasibility test from the "Three Frameworks" module outlines
three kinds of constraints: resource, interest (social or personality), and technical. Did any of these apply?
Outline these and other constraints and describe how they were dealt with in your drama.
4.3.7.7.1 Story Boards
Suggestions for Story Boards

â€¢ Divide your dramatization into four to six frmaes. Now draw a picture in each frame, one that captures
a key moment of your dramatization.
â€¢ Check for continuity. Each frame should present elements that show how it emerges from the previous
frame and how it transitions into the subsequent frame. The rst frame should help the reader nd
the context in which your drama takes place. The last frame should provide as much closure as your
drama permits.
â€¢ In general, your storyboard should summarize the dramatization you acted out in front of the rest of the
class. But while acting through your drama, you received feedback from the class and, perhaps, began
to rethink things. So feel free to make changes in your storyboard to reect your deeper understanding
of your decision point. If you make changes in your storyboard, discuss this in your dramatic reections.
Explain why you decided to change things.

5.2 Practical and Professional Ethics Bowl Activity: Follow-Up InDepth Case Analysis2
5.2.1 Module Introduction
This module provides students with a structure for preparing an in-depth case study analysis based on
feedback they have received through their participation in an Ethics Bowl competition as part of the
requirements for courses in Practical and Professional Ethics taught at the University of Puerto Rico at
Mayaguez. Students viewing this module will nd formats for analyzing decision making cases and position
cases such as the decisions published by the National Society of Professional Engineers Board of Ethical
Review. They will receive information pertinent to preparing in-depth case analyses, short summaries
of the case pool for the Ethics Bowl competition, and a summary of procedures for carrying out a group
self-evaluation. More information on the Engineering Ethics Bowl carried out at UPRM can be found in
Jose A Cruz-Cruz, William J. Frey, and Halley D. Sanchez, "The Ethics Bowl in Engineering Ethics at the
University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez" in Teaching Ethics 4(3): 15-32.

5.2.2 Choosing Your Case
1. You must choose one of the two cases you presented on in the Ethics Bowl. (This means the case on
which you gave your initial presentation.
2. You may choose either the rst round decision-making case or the NSPE Board of Ethical Review Case
How should you choose your case?
1. Which case did you nd the most interesting, challenging, or fruitful?
2. On which case did you receive the most interesting feedback from the other team and the judges?
3. Do you want to make, defend, and implement a decision or analyze a BER decision?
Once you choose your case, you need to analyze it according to the following steps:

5.2.3 In-Depth Analysis: Step by Step
Description of In-Depth Case Analysis
Title of Assignment: "In-Depth Case Analysis
Due Date for Written Projects:One week after the last class of the semester.
What is required?
1. Participation in at two ethics bowl competitions.
2. Each group will choose from the two cases it debated in the Ethics Bowl a case for a more extended
analysis carrying out the seven-step decision making framework. They will prepare an extended analysis of
this case (10 to 20 pages).
3. Each group will prepare summaries of the 15 cases assigned for the ethics bowl. These summaries
(a minimum of one page for each case) will be handed in with the extended case study analysis. These
summaries should include a problem statement, a solution evaluation matrix, and a feasibility matrix.
4. Each nal submission will also include a group self-evaluation. This evaluation will include:
_____a list of the goals each group set for itself
_____a careful, justied and documented assessment of your success in reaching these goals
_____a careful assessment of what you did and did not learn in this activity
_____a discussion of obstacles you encountered and measures your group took to overcome these.
_____a discussion of member participation and contribution including the member contribution
forms
â€¢ _____in general what worked and what didn't work for you and your group in this activity

Structure of Written Analysis

1. A brief summary of the case focusing on the ethically relevant facts.
2. A Socio-Technical System Table + Short paragraph on each of the seven categories.
3. A Value Table + a short paragraph on the embedded values you have identied and where they occur in
the STS. Then state whether you have found any value mismatches, magnied existing value conicts,
and remote/harmful consequences.

149
4. On the basis of your STS analysis and value conict analysis, provide a short, concise problem statement. Make sure your the problem you have identied is grounded in your STS and value analysis. If
not, one or the other (or both) needs to be changed.
5. A brainstorm list in which you record the solutions your group has designed to solve the problem
stated above. The rough unrened list should include around 10 solutions. Then rene this list into
three. Spend time detailing how you reached your rened list. Did you synthesize rough solutions? On
what basis did you leave a solution out all together? Did you nd other ways of relating or combining
solutions? Spend time documenting your brainstorming and rening process. Show in detail how you
came up with the rened list.
6. Do a comparative evaluation of three of the rened solutions you developed in the previous step. First,
prepare a solution evaluation matrix that summarizes your comparative evaluation. Use the table
provided below. Second, provide a verbal account of the solution evaluation and comparison process
you present in the solution evaluation matrix.
7. Reach a nal decision. Defend your decision using the ethics and feasibility tests. If the decision
situation in which you are working is a dynamic one, then proppose a series of solutions that you will
pursue simultaneously, including how you would respond to contingencies that might arise. (You could
express this in the form of a decision tree.)
8. Fill out a Feasibility Matrix. See matrix below
9. Present an implementation plan based on your Feasibility Matrix. This plan should list the obstacles
that might arise and how you plan to overcome them. (For example, don't just say, "Blow the whistle."
Discuss when, how, where, to whom, and in what manner. How would you deal with reprisals? Would
your action seriously disrupt internal relations of trust and loyalty? How would you deal with this?)
Work out a detailed plan to implement your decision using the feasibility constraints to "suggest"
obstacles and impedements.
10. Finally, discuss preventive measures you can take to prevent this type of problem from arising again
in the future.

5.2.4 Format
1. Group, team-written projects are to be 10-20 pages in length, double spaced, with standard 1-inch
margins, and typewritten. This does not include documentation, appendices, and other notes.
2. It is essential that you carefully and fully document the resources that you have consulted. The most
direct way to do this is to include numbered entries in a concluding section entitled, "Works Cited". These
entries should provide complete bibliographical information according to standard form (Chicago Manual of
Style or the MLA Manual of Style). Then insert the number of the entry in parenthesis in the text next to
the passage that is based on it. (Example: "The self is a relation that relates itself to its own self. . .." (4)
The number "4" refers to the forth item in the "Works Cited" section at the end of your paper.)
3. Practical norm 5j of the CIAPR code of ethics sets forth the obligation of the professional engineer to
give others due credit for their work. For this reason, plagiarism will not be tolerated in any form. Possible
forms of plagiarism include but are not limited to the following:

â€¢ Quoting directly from other sources without documenting (footnote or bibliography) and/or without
using quotation marks. Claiming that this is an appendix will not excuse this action. Claiming
ignorance will not excuse this action.
â€¢ Using the ideas or work of others without giving due credit or proper acknowledgment. "Proper acknowledgment, in this context, requires a standard bibliographical reference and the use of quotation
marks if the material is being directly quoted.
â€¢ If your paper relies exclusively or primarily on extensively quoted materials or materials closely paraphrased from the work of others, then it will not be credited as your work even if you document it. To
make it your own, you have to summarize it in your own words, analyze it, justify it, or criticize it.
â€¢ You will not be credited for material that you translate from English to Spanish unless you add to it
something substantial of your own.
â€¢ In general, what you appropriate from another source must be properly digested, analyzed, and expressed in your own words. If you have any questions on this, please ask me.
â€¢ Any plagiarized documentone which violates the above ruleswill be given a zero. You will be given
a chance to make this up, and the grade on the make-up project will be averaged in with the zero given
to the plagiarized document. Since this is a group grade, everyone in the group will be treated the
same, even though the plagiarizer may be only one person. Each member of the group is responsible
to assure that other members do not plagiarize in the name of the group. (Since the due date for
the written project is late in the semester, this will probably require that I give the entire group, i.e.,
all members, an Incomplete.) Each member of the group will be held individually responsible in the
above-described manner for the nal content of the written report.
4. This is not a research project but an exercise in integrating ethics into real world cases. In Chapters
2 and 3 of Engineering Ethics: Concepts and Cases, the authors present a thorough discussion of the case
study analysis/problem solving method discussed in class. You also have supporting handouts in your le
folders from Magic Copy Center as well as materials I have presented directly in class. Engineering Ethics:
Concepts and Cases also contains several sample case studies that can help guide you in constructing your
own presentation. What I am looking for is a discussion of the case in terms of the ethical approaches and
decision-making frameworks we have discussed this semester. You do not need to "wow" me with research

into other areas peripherally related to the case; you need to show me that you have practiced decision-making
and made a serious eort to integrate ethical considerations into the practice of engineering.
5. The usual criteria concerning formal presentations apply when competing in the Ethics Bowl. Dress
professionally.
6. You may write your group, team-written project in either Spanish or English.
7. All competitions will take place in the regular classroom.

5.3 Ethics Bowl: Cases and Score Sheets4
5.3.1 Module Introduction
This module is designed to give you a brief orientation in the Ethics Bowl competition. It is designed to
compliment and complete other modules concerning the ethics bowl that you will nd in the Corporate
Governance course.

5.3.2 Ethics Bowl Rules (briey)
â€¢ The moderator will begin the competition by ipping a coin to determine which team will present rst.
If the team that calls wins the toss, they choose whether they or the other team go rst.
â€¢ Monday: (1) Team 1 will have one minute to consult and seven minutes to give its initial presentation.
The presentation must be tied to the question/task given to it by the moderator. (2) Team 2 has a
minute to consult and seven minutes to make its Commentary on Team 1's presentation. Team 2 can
close its commentary by posing a question to Team 1. (3) Team 1 then has a minute to consult and
veminutes to respond to Team 2's Commentary. (4) Team 1 will then answer questions posed by the
two peer review teams. Each peer review team will ask a question. A quick follow-up is allowed. The
peer review question and answer session will go for 15 minutes. (5) The peer review teams will score
the rst half of the competition but not announce the results.
â€¢ Wednesday: The same procedure will occur while reversing the roles between Teams 1 and 2. Thus,
team 2 will present, team 1 comment, team 2 respond, and then team 2 will answer questions from the
peer review panels. The peer review panels will add the scores for the second part of the competition
but will hold o on announcing the results until Friday's class.
â€¢ Friday: The two peer review teams will present and explain their scores. Peer Review teams will take
note: you're objective is not to criticize or evaluate the debating teams but to provide them feedback
in terms of the four categories.
â€¢ Debating teams may trade minutes from consulting to presenting. For example, Team 1 may decide to
take two minutes to consult when given their case and task. This means that they will have 6 minutes,
instead of 7, to present.
â€¢ Nota Bene: Debating teams and Peer Review teams are not allowed to bring notes into the competition.
You will be provided with paper to take notes once the competition starts.
â€¢ Even though the national Ethics Bowl competition allows only one presenter, debating teams will be
allowed to "pass the baton." When one person nishes speaking, another can step in his or her place.
It is absolutely forbidden that more than one person speak at a time. Also, the competing team's
speaking time is limited to its commentary. Once that is over, they are instructed to quitely listen.
Infractions will be followed rst by a warning. Second infractions will result in points being taken
away.

5.3.3 Competition Time Line
1. Team 1 Presentation: One minute to consult, seven minutes to present.
2. Team 2 Commentary: One minute to consult, seven minutes to present.
3. Team 1 Response to Commentary: One minute to consult, ve minutes to respond.

CHAPTER 5.

BUSINESS ETHICS BOWL

4. The question and answer session between Team 1 and the Peer Review teams will last 15 minutes
(running clock). The rst peer review team will have 7 minutes 30 seconds for its questions and the
second will have roughly the same time.
5. In the second round, the time line is the same while the debating teams change roles.

5.3.4 Advice to Debating Teams
â€¢ Tell us what you are going to do, do it, and then tell us what you have done. In other words, start your
presentation with a summary, then launch into the main body of your presentation, and then conclude
with another summary. This will help the listening audience understand what you are trying to do.
â€¢ Be professional, formal, and courteous. Address yourself to the other team and the peer review team.
It is a good idea to stand when you are giving your initial presentation.
â€¢ Be sure to communicate your understanding of the scoring criteria. What do you and your team
understand by intelligibility, ethical integration, feasibility, and moral imagination/creativity? Take
time to listen to the other team and the peer review teams to gain insights into their understanding.
During the commentary and the question and answer session you will get crucial clues into what others
think you have achieved and where you need further work. Use this feedback.
â€¢ Be sure to thank the peer review teams, moderators, and your opponents during and after the competition. Such formalities make it possible to penetrate to the deeper practices that underlie the virtue
of reasonableness.
â€¢ Relax and have fun! You may not have the opportunity to say everything you want to say. One of the
purposes behind this competition is to help you see just how hard it is to advocate for ethical positions.
We almost always have to do so under serious constraints such as time limits. Also, remember that
you have other forums for "getting it said," namely, your group self evaluation and your in-depth
case analysis. In these places you will be able to discuss these issues in the kind of depth you think
necessary.

157

5.3.5 Advice to the Peer Review Teams on Scoring
â€¢ Remember that all three scoring events of the competition are worth 20 points. The initial presentation,
the response to the commentary and questions, and the commentary on the other team's presentation
all count for the same 20 points.
â€¢ Although you have the complete rubric only for the initial presentation, you will score the other parts
of the presentation based on the four criteria: intelligibility, ethical integration, feasibility and moral
imagination/creativity. You will score 1 to 5 on each criteria for a total of 20.
â€¢ Three is the middle of the road score. In other words, three is a good, average score. It is not a Cdon't
think of scoring as grading. Start each team o from a default of three. Then move o that default
only when something exceptionally good or not so good happens. If your scores deviate much from
straight twelves (36), then you are scoring too high or too low.

5.3.6 Ethics Bowl Scoring Criteria
1. Intelligibility includes three skills or abilities: (1) the ability to construct and compare multiple
arguments representing multiple viewpoints; (2) the ability to construct arguments and provide reasons
that are clear, coherent, and factually correct; (3) evidence of realizing the virtue of reasonableness by
formulating and presenting value integrative solutions?
2. Integrating Ethical Concerns includes three skills: (1) presenting positions that are clearly reversible between stakeholders; (2) identifying and weighing key consequences of positions considered;
(3) developing positions that integrate values like integrity, responsibility, reasonableness, honesty,
humility, and justice.
3. Feasibility implies that the positions taken and the arguments formulated demonstrate full recognition
and integration of interest, resource, and technical constraints. While solutions are designed with
constraints in mind, these do not serve to trump ethical considerations.
4. Moral Imagination and Creativity demonstrate four skill sets: (1) ability to clearly formulate and
frame ethical issues and problems; (2) ability to provide multiple framings of a given situation; (3)
ability to identify and integrate conicting stakeholders and stakes; (4) ability to generate solutions
and positions that are non-obvious, i.e., go beyond what is given in the situation.

CHAPTER 5.

BUSINESS ETHICS BOWL

5.3.7 Peer Review Team Responsibilities
â€¢ Attend the debate sessions and the feedback session on Friday after the competition. Remember this
is the capstone event of the course. It looks bad if you do not bother to attend.
â€¢ You team will ask questions during the debate. This will constitute, at a minimum, one question and a
quick follow up if necessary. You are not to debate with the presenting team. So your questions should
not be designed to trap them. Rather, seek through your questions to explore seeming weak points,
unclear statements, and incomplete thoughts. Use your questions to help you line up the debating
team against the four criteria.
â€¢ Fill out the score sheet and assess the debating teams in terms of intelligibility, integrating ethics,
feasibility and moral imagination/creativity.
â€¢ Lead, with the other Peer Review team, the feedback sessions. This requires that you prepare a short,
informal presentation that shows your scoring and then explains it.
â€¢ Always, always, always be courteous in your feedback comments. Try to present things positively and
proactively. This is dicult but practice now will serve you well later when you are trying to explaibn
to a supervisor how he or she has made a mistake.

5.4.1 MAIN CONTENT ( MODULE / EXERCISE / CASE )
Module Introduction

The "Prerequisite link" included in the upper right-hand corner of this module opens the module content
located at the IIT Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions. This le, "Report on Ethics
Integration Projects," was prepared by Dr. Jose Cruz-Cruz as the follow-up to a workshop he attended
at the Illinois Institute of Technology on ethics across the curriculum. Directed by Michael Davis (Senior
Fellow at the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions), the IIT EAC workshop was funded by the
National Science Foundation.

Read the cases in the Appendix from page 8 to page 12.
Prepare a position paper on each case. Since the cases terminate at a decision point, make a decision
and justify it in terms of reversibility, harm/benecence, and publicity. Then carry out a global
feasibility analysis. For more on the tests and a decision making framework consult the module,
"Three Frameworks in Ethical Decision-Making." See link above.
5. Prepare for the Ethics Bowl debate by studying the procedures and scoring criteria presented in the
report at IIT.
The Ethics Bowl can be divided into eight stages

1. Team 1 receives its case and gives an initial presentation taking an ethical position and providing an
ethical justication.
2. Team 2 makes a commentary that critically analyzes Team 1's presentation.
3. Team 1 responds to Team 2's commentary.
4. Fifteen minutes are alloted for the judges in the peer review teams to ask Team 1 questions. After this,
the judges/peer review teams score the rst half of the competition without announcing the results.
5. Team 2 receives its case and makes an initial presentation in which it states and justies its decision
or position.
6. Team 1 gives a commentary to Team 2's presentation. They can take a counter-position as well as
reveal weaknesses in Team 2's position and justication.
7. Team 2 responds to Team 1's commentary.
8. Team 2 answers questions from the judges for 15 minutes.

CHAPTER 5.

BUSINESS ETHICS BOWL

5.4.2 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Summary of Scoring Criteria

â€¢ Intelligibility includes three skills or abilities: (1) the ability to construct and compare multiple
arguments representing multiple viewpoints; (2) the ability to construct arguments and provide reasons
that are clear, coherent, and factually correct; (3) evidence of realizing the virtue of reasonableness by
formulating and presenting value integrative solutions.
â€¢ Integrating Ethical Concerns includes three skills: (1) presenting positions that are clearly reversible between stakeholders; (2) identifying and weighing key consequences of positions considered;
(3) developing positions that integrate values like integrity, responsibility, reasonableness, honesty,
humility, and justice.
â€¢ Feasibility implies that the positions taken and the arguments formulated demonstrate full recognition
and integration of interest, resource, and technical constraints. While solutions are designed with
constraints in mind, these do not serve to trump ethical considerations.
â€¢ Moral Imagination and Moral Creativity demonstrate four skill sets: (1) ability to clearly formulate and frame ethical issues and problems; (2) ability to provide multiple framings of a given situation;
(3) ability to identify and integrate conicting stakeholders and stakes; (4) ability to generate solutions
and positions that are non-obvious, i.e., go beyond what is given in the situation.
5.4.2.1 Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for this module conveniently divide into content areas and skills. The content
objectives can be found in the AACSB ethics criteria of ethical leadership, ethical decision-making,
social responsibility, and corporate governance. The skills objectives include the skills emphasized at
the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez: ethical awareness, ethical evaluation, ethical integration,
ethical prevention, and value realization. In addition, there are the criteria of moral creativity and
moral imagination.
Content Objectives

â€¢ Ethical Leadership: You have examined ethical leadership by looking at the moral exemplars portrayed in the module of that name. What skills and virtues do moral exemplars exhibit? How do these
skills and virtues "cluster"? What can you do to exhibit moral leadership? In making and defending
your decisions in the Ethics Bowl, spend time showing the peer review teams how your decisions exhibit
moral leadership.
â€¢ Ethical Decision-Making: We are using a decision making framework this semester that emphasizes four stages: (1) problem specication, (2) solution generation, (3) solution testing, (4) solution
implementation. Spend time during the debate to show that you know what the problem is you are
trying to solve. In preparing for the debate, you have carried out a brainstorming process to generate
a solution list; you will be able to show evidence of this when you do your in-depth case analysis.
Solution testing you carry out when you evaluate and rank alternatives in terms of their ethics. Try
not to neglect the nal stage where you show the feasibility of the solution you are advocating. Show
that you have thought through implementation carefully, even to the extent of uncovering the most
likely obstacles to your solution.
â€¢ Social Responsibility: The Socio-Technical System grids we have worked on in class will help to
uncover issues of social responsibility in the cases for the Ethics Bowl. Social responsibility requires
that you step back from your decision point to look at the broader social and political implications of
what you are doing.
â€¢ Corporate Governance: Many of you will quickly determine that the participant perspectives from
which you are asked to make your decisions are tightly constrained by organizational problems. Companies that discourage communication, seek to pass blame down to those low on the hierarchy, and
pressure employees to take legal and ethical short cuts bear much of the blame for creating the ethical

163
problems you are required to solve. But stay focused on your agent's perspective. Formulate concrete
strategies for leading organizational change from that perspective. You can talk about changing the
organizational culture. Solving the problem may require reforming the "system." But do not fall into
the trap of blaming the system.
Skill Objectives

â€¢ Ethical Awareness: You will demonstrate ethical awareness by how well you identify and frame the
ethical issues and problem that arise in the case you debate. If you spend time in your presentation
framing the problem raised in your case and making sure the peer review team understands how you
see the problem, you will do well in this category. A helpful hint: many of the cases you will be
debating can be sharply specied as value conict problems. Show the values that are in conict and
how you will go about integrating them.
â€¢ Ethical Evaluation: You have already spent time practicing ethical evaluation by using the ethics
tests to assess and rank solution alternatives in the Hughes case. The tests help you to hone in on the
ethical strengths and weakness of solution alternatives. When the tests converge on a solution, this is
a strong sign of its ethical strength. When they diverge, this signals to you the need to reformulate
the solution to cover the "ethics gaps" raised by the tests.
â€¢ Ethical Integration: You have examined the analogy between design and ethics problems. In ethics
problems, we create solutions that realize, balance, and integrate the ethical specications. We also
implement these solutions over situational constraints like resource, interest, and technical constraints.
Ethical Integration requires that you make clear the solution formulation process that your solution
demonstrates. Make it crystal clear to the peer review teams that you have designed your solution to
realize ethical considerations while respecting situational constraints.
â€¢ Ethical Prevention: This is not the prevention of the ethical but the anticipation of potential problems and the development of counter-measures to prevent these problems from arising or to minimize
their impact. The earlier we address ethical problems the easier they are to solve. Taking a preventive
stance toward ethical problems is the best way to promote ethics int he real world.
â€¢ Value Realization: Finally, make the move from asking how to x things when they go wrong to
how to make things continually better. As professionals, you are in the position to use your knowledge
and skills to realize values of all types. Now you can put this to work to identify ethical value "gaps"
and develop strategies for eliminating them.
A quick word on two additional objectives. Moral imagination requires examining a situation from multiple
framings. As we have already seen in class, some of you approach problems from a social perspective.
You see eective solutions lying in leading opposition, forming coalitions among co-workers, and leading
organizational charges to resolve injustices. But others seek to formulate problems in technical terms.
Changing the manufacturing process, pressing for technically innovative designs, and formulating situations
as technical puzzles. The point here is that the one does not exclude the other, and moral imagination
requires working through these and other possible framings.
As we have seen in the reversibility test, moral imagination also requires projecting ourselves into the
positions of others and viewing the situation from their standpoint. This does not require abandoning
ourselves to this perspective, especially when there are moral problems with doing so. But showing during
the course of the debate that you have taken time to explore the situation from the standpoint of the dierent
stakeholders, that you have taken the time to listen to and understand the objections of the other team, and
that you have carefully considered the issues raised by the peer review teams is the best way to show moral
imagination in the Ethics Bowl.
Moral creativity requires showing that you have taken the eort to design non-obvious solutions to the
problems at hand. Going beyond the obvious requires re-framing so moral creativity requires moral imagination. But moral creativity also requires exercise of the virtue of reasonableness. If you are confronted with
a solution where values are in conict, have you considered creative, out-of-the-box methods for integrating
them? When one way of framing the problem and the situation fails to produce helpful answers, have you
tried reformulating the problem? If you cannot solve the entire problem, ahve you tried solving a part and

setting the rest aside for a more productive time? Moral creativity requires demonstration of out-of-the-box
thinking on how to solve moral problems.
5.4.2.2 Additional Activities
Activities Before and After the Ethics Bowl

â€¢ Work with and practice your ethical approaches, ethics tests, and other frameworks. They will help
structure your presentation, responses to the other teams, and answers to the peer review judges'
questions.
â€¢ Prepare your cases. This requires developing a format or template that makes it possible for one
person to specialize on the case but facilitates disseminating the case to the rest of the team. Solution
evaluation matrices help. So do concise problem statements.
â€¢ After the Ethics Bowl you will be asked to do an in-depth analysis of the case you debated during
the competition. You will nd a format for this analysis in the Engineering Ethics Bowl: Follow-up
In-Depth Case Analysis module, m13759.
â€¢ Finally, what did you learn while working together as a team? What kind of cooperative problems
developed? How did you solve them? Did they correspond to the problems raised by the "Ethics of
Team Work" module or were they dierent? In fact, go back over that module and see how well it
prepared you for the issues that arose as you interacted with your team.

6.1.2 Introduction
This module provides a range of assessment rubrics used in classes on engineering and computer ethics.
Rubrics will help you understand the standards that will be used to assess your writing in essay exams and
group projects. They also help your instructor stay focused on the same set of standards when assessing the
work of the class. Each rubric describes what counts as exceptional writing, writing that meets expectations,
and writing that falls short of expectations in a series of explicit ways. The midterm rubrics break this
down for each question. The nal project rubrics describe the major parts of the assignment and then break
down each part according to exceptional, adequate, and less than adequate. These rubrics will help you to
understand what is expected of you as you carry out the assignment, provide a useful study guide for the
activity, and familiarize you with how your instructor has assessed your work.

6.2 Realizing Responsibility Through Class Participation12
6.2.1 Module Introduction
Class attendance is a normal part of every college course. In the past, attendance was left up to the individual
student. Now universities, adopting the responsibility of being local parents, require that teachers monitor
class attendance closely by taking attendance each class and reporting students who are chronically absent.
This makes use of what are termed "compliance systems": minimum standards of acceptable attendance are
established and communicated to students, behavior is regularly monitored, and non-compliance is punished.
In compliance approaches, the focus is placed on maintaining the minimum level of behavior necessary to
avoid punishment. But this leaves unmentioned higher levels and standards of conduct. Students who miss
more than X number of classes are punished by having points subtracted from their overall grade. But
what constitutes outstanding attendance or, more positively, excellent participation? This module uses class
attendance as an occasion to teach the dierent concepts of moral responsibility. After outlining blame
responsibility and excuse-making, it explores responsibility as a virtue or excellence. Being absent creates its
own responsibilities (1) to the teacher (you are responsible for nding out the material covered and learning
it on your own), (2) to your classmates (what did your class group do in your absence and how will you
reintegrate yourself into the group as an equal participant), and (3) to yourself (what habits will you change
to improve your participation in class).

6.2.2 Where excuses come from
Understanding Morally Legitimate Excuses

â€¢ The table below lists characteristics of what ethicists call "capacity responsibility." These conditions
presented by F.H. Bradleydescribe when we can associate an agent with an action for the purposes
of moral evaluation. They consist of (1) self-sameness, (2) moral sense, and (3) ownership.

CHAPTER 6.

COURSE PROCEDURES

â€¢ Self-sameness bases responsibility on the ability to maintain an identity over time; you must be the
same person at the moment of accountability that you were when you performed the action. You
cannot be blamed for actions performed by somebody else. So Jorge cannot be blamed for classes
missed by Jose. Your professor should be held responsible for taking accurate attendance and not
marking you absent when you are actually in class.
â€¢ The moral sense condition requires that you have the capacity to appreciate and comply with moral
directives. This includes certain perceptual sensitivities (the ability to recognize elements of a situation that are morally relevant), emotional responses (that you respond to moral elements with the
appropriate emotion), and the ability to shape action in accordance with moral standards. Those who
lack moral sense, whether temporarily as with children or because of psychological limitations as with
psychopaths are non-responsible rather than guilty or innocent. They simply lack the general capacity
to be held accountable.
â€¢ Ownership gets down to the specics of a given situation. Did factors in the situation compel you
to miss class? Did you miss class because you lacked certain crucial bits of knowledge? Why were
you unable to attend class and can this "why" be translated into a morally legitimate excuse. In
excusing an action, you "disown" it. There are three ways to do this: a) by showing unavoidable
and conicting obligations, b) by pointing to compelling circumstances, or c) by citing
excusable ignorance.
â€¢ Formally dened, compulsion is the production in an individual of a state of mind or body against
the actual will. Sickness is a state of mind and body that could compel you to stay at home even
though you want to come to class and take the test. Having a at tire on the way to school could also
produce a state of body (being stuck at the side of the road) against actual will (driving to class in
order to take the test). With compulsion, the key test is whether the compelling circumstances were
under your control. Did your tire go at because you postponed getting a new set of tires, even when
it was clear that you needed them? Are you sick and in bed now because you overdid it at the party
last night? If the compelling circumstances resulted from actions that you performed voluntarily in
the past, then you are still responsible.
â€¢ You also need to have the knowledge necessary to act responsibly in a given situation. Imagine that
your class was being taught by a professor who claimed to be a CIA agent. He would repeatedly change
the times and locations of class meetings at the last minute to keep from being discovered by enemy
spies. Not knowing where (or when) the next class would be held would make it impossible to attend.
Here you would get o the hook for missing class because of excusable ignorance. But suppose changes
in class schedule were announced during class by the professor, but you were absent on that day. You
are now responsible for your ignorance because you should have found out what was covered while you
were absent in the past. In other words, your ignorance in the present was caused by your neglecting
to nd things out in the past. You are responsible because voluntary actions in the past (and inaction)
caused the state of ignorance in the present.
â€¢ The table below provides sample excuses given by students for absences. These are correlated with
conditions of capacity responsibility such as ignorance and compulsion. Correlating excuses with
conditions of imputability is one thing. Validating them is something else, and none of these excuses
have been validated.
â€¢ Here are some more typical excuses oered by students for missing class. Try correlating them with
the conditions of imputability to which they tacitly appeal: (1) I missed your class because I needed
the time for studying for a test in another class. (2) I missed class because the electricity went out
during the night and my electric alarm clock didn't go o on time. (3) I planned on going to class but
got called into work at the last minute by my boss. In all these cases, you have missed class and have
a reason. Can your reason be correlated with ignorance or compulsion? Were you negligent, careless,
or reckless in allowing these conditions of ignorance and compulsion to develop?
â€¢ Excuses (and blame) emerge out of a nuanced process of negotiation. Much depends on trust. Your
professor might excuse you for missing a class at the end of the semester if your attendance up to that
point had been exemplary. He could, on this basis, treat the absence as an exception to an otherwise

exemplary pattern of attendance and participation.
â€¢ But you may have trouble getting o the hook this time, if there have been several previous absences,
because the new absence falls into a pattern of poor participation accompanied by lame excuses.
Excuse negotiation (and blame responsibility) occur over the background of other values such as trust
and honesty.

Excuse Statement (Some Examples)

1. Conicts within a role responsibility and between dierent role
responsibilities.

I have a special project due in another class and nishing it conicts with attending your class.

2. Overly determining situational
constraints: conicting interests.

I am interviewing for a position
after I graduate, and I must be

3. Overly determining situational
constraints: resource constraints

My car had a at tire. My
babysitter couldn't come so I had
to stay home with my child. My
alarm clock didn't go o because
of a power outage.

4. Knowledge limitations

Class was rescheduled, and I was
unaware of the change.

5. Knowledge limitations

I didn't know the assignment for
class so I came unprepared. (Not
an excuse for missing class)

Table 6.1

Exercise 1: Provide a Morally Justiable Excuse for Missing Class

â€¢ Oer an honest and responsible ethical assessment of the reason you were unable to carry out your
role responsibility for coming to class. Note that the default here is attending class and any departure
from the default (i.e., missing class) requires a moral justication.
â€¢ Begin by examining whether your action can be classied as an excuse arising out of compulsion or
ignorance.
â€¢ Your absence may not be morally excusable. In this case, you cannot excuse your absence but still
must explain it.
â€¢ Remember that, following Aristotle, you must show that your action was done under and because of
compulsion or under and because of ignorance. In other words, you must show that it did not arise
from past negligence or recklessness.

6.2.3 Proactive/Prospective Responsibility
Principle of Responsive Adjustment

â€¢ Responsibility for both good and bad things often emerges as a pattern exhibited by a series of action.
If you miss one class after establishing a pattern of good attendance and active participation, then
your teacher will look for something exceptional that prevented you from doing what you habitually
do. But if one absence falls into a series with other absences, then this reveals a pattern and your
teacher begins to classify you as someone who is chronically absent.

CHAPTER 6.

COURSE PROCEDURES

â€¢ So, it is not enough to oer a moral excuse to get "o the hook" for your absence. Expressing remorse,
guilt, and regret do not substitute for taking active measures to avoid repeating the wrongful act.
These changes or responsive adjustments clue others in to whether you have learned from your past
mistakes. What happened in the past was bad and you regret it; but are you willing to make the
necessary changes in your future conduct to avoid repetition of the bad act?
â€¢ This is expressed by the "Principle of Responsive Adjustment" (or PRA). Stated negatively,
failure to take measures to prevent past excusable wrongs from reoccurring in the future leads to a
reevaluation of these past actions. Failure to responsively adjust shows that the past action belongs
to context of similar bad actions indicating a bad habit or bad character. This, in turn, leads to a
reevaluation of the past act; what when taken in isolation was not blameworthy becomes blameworthy
when inserted into this broader context. Showing an unwillingness to learn from the past betrays
entrenched attitudes of negligence, carelessness, or recklessness. (See Peter A. French, Corporate
and Collective Responsibility)
Responsibility as a Virtue

â€¢ Responsibility can be recongured as a virtue or excellence.
â€¢ The table below describes the characteristics of a preventive stance where we begin by identifying
potential wrongs and harms. Once we identify these then we take serious measures to prevent them
from occurring.
â€¢ Finally, responsibility as a virtue opens up the horizon of the exemplary. Pursuing excellence requires
our identifying opportunities to go beyond preventing harm to realizing value.
â€¢ In this context, class attendance becomes class participation. As was said in the introduction, missing
a class creates a series of new tasks that arise out of your commitment to excellence in participation.
These include the following:
â€¢ 1. What was covered while you were absent? Or better, if you know in advance that you are going to
miss a class, what will be covered? How can you cover this material on your own? What can you do,
proactively, to stay with the class during your absence?
â€¢ 2. How will your absence impact the rest of the class (especially those in your class group), and what
can you do to minimize any harmful eects? Here you should notify your team members that you are
going to miss class and develop plans for maintaining your equal participation in the group and class
during and after your absence.
â€¢ 3. In accordance with the Principle of Responsive Adjustment, what changes are you making to avoid
absences in the future orputting it as positively as possibleto achieve a level of excellence in class
participation?
â€¢ Note how all these items focus on improvement or betterment rather than "making up." As Dewey
recognizes, the real function of moral responsibility is to take the lessons we learn from the past and
use them to improve ourselves.

strategies

Avoid trying to diuse
the blame for missing
class on some other person or situation. For example, I couldn't come
to class because I had
a project due in another class is not a
morally legitimate excuse because it places
the blame on the other

responsibilities with overlapping
domains

If you fail to participate in a group activity, describe the group's

depth of knowledge.

Describe how you found
out what was covered in
class and document how

Extend power and control

Describe the measures
you have taken to eliminate the responsibility
gap between you and
your work group. For
example, how did you

missed.

Adopt a proactive problem solving/preventive
approach for the future

Describe what measures
you have taken to avoid
missing classes in the future.

Table 6.2

Guidelines for Avoiding Absences

1. Build redundancy into your schedule. Many students develop schedules that are "tightly-coupled."
This means that failures or breakdowns cannot be isolated; then tend to ow over into other areas
producing a cascading disaster. A co-worker calls in sick, and your boss calls you in during the time
you have a class. You miss one class and fail to study for another. (The time you set aside for study has
been taken up by this unexpected job demand.) You have been working so hard to catch up that you

CHAPTER 6.

COURSE PROCEDURES

catch a cold. Now everything becomes that much harder because you are not working to full capacity.
The lesson here is to set up your schedule from the beginning with a certain amount of exibility built
in. This could be as simple as taking four instead of ve classes or working 10 instead of 20 hours per
week.
2. Look for incentives or motives to come to class. One important incentive is that you may get a better
grade. Teachers tend to know students who come to class better; they consider them more responsible
and more committed.
3. Get proactive when you return. Instead of asking the professor, "Did we do anything important while
I was absent?" consult the syllabus and a classmate to nd out what you missed. Then check your
understanding with the professor. "My understanding is that you discussed moral responsibility with
the class and applied the framework to a case. Is this correct?" Instead of asking the professor, "What
should I do to make up for what I missed?" come with your own plan. Show that you have taken
responsibility for your absence by getting proactive and planning the future around realizing value.
4. Absences have an impact on your fellow students as much as on you or your instructor. If you are
working in groups, nd out from your peers what was covered. If your group is depending on your
completing a task for the class you are missing, try to develop a "work-around." ("I won't be in class
tomorrow but I am sending you my part of the group assignment via email attachment.") Let your
team know what is happening with you and make sure that you keep up on all your commitment and
responsibilities to the group.
Exercise 2: Getting Proactive about your absence

â€¢ Develop a plan for "getting back into the loop." What are you going to do to cover the material and
activities you have missed?
â€¢ Get Preventive. Describe what you are going to do now to avoid absences in the future.
â€¢ Shoot for the ideal. What can you doabove and beyond class attendanceto realize exemplary participation in your ethics class.

6.2.4 Conclusion
Exercise #3: Getting and Staying Honest

â€¢ Below is a template that you need to duplicate, ll out, and place in the class attendance le that will
be on the desk in front of class.
â€¢ Duplicate and sign the honesty pledge at the end of this module.
â€¢ Students often wish to provide evidence documenting their claims regarding their absences. You may
do this, but remember that this is neither required nor in the spirit of prospective responsibility.
â€¢ Furthermore, be aware that you are not to provide condential information such as personal health
information or student id numbers or social security numbers. Health issues are to be referred to
generically by saying something like, I was unable to come to class Tuesday because of health reasons.
1. Class Missed (Day of week and date):
2. Material covered during class:
3. Reason for missing class (please do not provide condential information):
4. Action Plan for Absence: How you intend to take responsibility for the material covered while you were
absent; How you intend to make reparations to your group for not participating in group learning activities
for the class you missed;
5. How do you plan to avoid absences in the future:
Honesty Pledge

Corporate Governance

This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to ethics in business and provides modules in Ethical Leadership, Ethical Decision-Making, Social Responsibility, and Corporate Governance. Students will actively
study ethical theory by carrying out exercises to help them build theory-based tools for encountering ethical
problems in business practice. They will also work with cases in business ethics designed to give them practice
in developing skills of ethical leadership, ethical decision-making, and carrying out socio-technical analyses
to respond to issues of social responsibility. This course will culminate in an Ethics Bowl competition in
which students will practice ethics advocacy in a variety of organizational contexts in business. This course
is being developed as a part of an NSF-funded project, "Collaborative Development of Ethics Across the
Curriculum Resources and Sharing of Best Practices," NSF SES 0551779.
