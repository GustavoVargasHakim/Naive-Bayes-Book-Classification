Current Liabilities

Toyota Applies the Brakes
On March 19, 2014, Toyota Motor Corporation agreed to settle an outstanding legal
issue with the U.S. Department of Justice by paying a $1.2 billion (USD) penalty. This
amount represented approximately 1/3 of the company’s total profit in 2013. The issue
related to a problem of unintended acceleration in various Toyota vehicles and the
subsequent investigation of those problems. These problems received widespread
media attention between November 2009 and January 2010, when Toyota recalled
over 9 million vehicles worldwide to replace faulty floor mats and repair sticking
accelerator pedals. The effect of this problem, and the resulting media frenzy, was
significant: in one week of trading in January 2010, Toyota’s share price dropped by
15%. The total cost to the company is difficult to determine, but is likely several billion
dollars when the effects of lost sales, repairs, and the settled and outstanding lawsuits
are combined with the above penalty.
Companies like Toyota that manufacture complex consumer products can face
significant product liabilities. Automobiles are likely to carry warranties that may
require service over a period of several years. The costs of providing this service may
be significant if there are product quality issues. As well, automobile manufacturers
engage in a process of voluntary recalls when product faults potentially impact public
safety. When product faults cause injury or death, the company faces further liabilities
in the form of legal actions taken by the survivors.
From an accounting perspective, the question is whether these warranty and product
safety costs represent liabilities and, if so, how can they be measured? On Toyota’s
March 31, 2015, financial statement, an amount of 1,328,916 million yen was accrued
as a “liability for quality assurance.” Note 13 describes this amount as a combination
of estimated warranty costs and costs for recalls and other safety measures. Since
2013, this amount had risen by 15% from the previous year by 32%.
Toyota has recognized both the warranty costs and the recall costs as liabilities at
the time of sale, based on the terms of the warranty contract and past experience.
Although past experience can certainly provide a base for these estimations, there is
no precise way to predict future expenditures, as there are numerous variables that
affect product quality.
With respect to legal actions taken by customers, these are even more difficult to
predict, as the results are determined through the due process of the legal system.

Current Liabilities

As a consequence of the unintended acceleration issue, Toyota faced hundreds of
lawsuits, both individual and class action, claiming a wide range of damages. Note
23 of Toyota’s March 31, 2015, financial statements indicated that the company was
“unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss” beyond the amounts accrued.
It is clear that companies like Toyota face significant challenges in accounting for
product warranty and product safety issues. These amounts do, however, need to be
accrued and disclosed when possible, as the amounts can be material to the operation
of the business.

Introduction
If you recall our discussion about financial statement elements from the review chapter,
one of the key components of financial statements identified by the conceptual framework
is the liability. The proper management of liabilities is an essential feature of business
success. Liabilities can impose legal and operational constraints on a business, and
managers need to be prudent and strategic in the management of these obligations.
Shareholders and potential investors are also interested in the composition of a company’s liabilities, as the restrictions created by these obligations will have a significant
effect on the timing and amount of future cash flows. Creditors, of course, have a direct
interest in the company’s liabilities, as they are the ultimate beneficiaries of these obligations. Because of the broad interest in these types of accounts, it is important that the
accountant have a thorough understanding of the issues in recognition, measurement,
and disclosure of liabilities.
Liabilities can take many forms. The most obvious example would be when a company
borrows money from a bank and agrees to repay it later. Another common situation occurs
when companies purchase goods on credit, agreeing to pay the supplier within a specified
time period. These types of examples are easy to understand, but there are situations
where the existence of the liability may not be so clear. When a retail store offers loyalty
points to its customers, does this create a liability for the store? Or, when you purchase a
new car and the manufacturer offers a five-year warranty against repairs, does this create
a liability and, if so, how much should be recorded?
In this chapter we will examine current liabilities, provisions, and contingent liabilities. We
will look at the recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements for these types of
accounts. Long-term financial liabilities will be discussed in Chapter 13.

12.1 Definition
From the “Why Accounting?” Chapter, recall that the definition of liability is “a present
obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to
result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits” (CPA
Canada, 2016, 4.4 b). This definition embodies three essential concepts.
First, the liability needs to be a present obligation. This means that at the financial
reporting date the entity must have some legal or constructive force that will compel it
to settle the obligation. This suggests that the company has no effective way to avoid the
obligation. Although this often is the result of the ability of the creditor to legally enforce
payment, liabilities can still exist even in the absence of a legal authority. The concept of
a constructive obligation suggests that as a result of a company’s past business practice,
its desire to maintain a good reputation, or even its desire to simply act (and be seen
as acting) in an ethical manner, a liability may be created even in the absence of legal
enforceability.
Second, the obligation must be the result of a past event. Two common examples of
events that would give rise to a liability include the purchase of goods on credit or the
receipt of loan proceeds from a bank. The events, which result in economic benefits
being delivered to the company, clearly create an obligation. On the other hand, if a
company plans to purchase goods in the future, this does not create an obligation, as no
event has yet occurred. Although these examples are quite straightforward, we will see
later in this chapter that in some situations it is more difficult to ascertain whether a past
event has created a present obligation.
The third criterion requires a future outflow of economic benefits. Although we can easily
understand the repayment of an outstanding account payable as a use of economic
resources, there are other ways that liabilities can be settled that don’t involve the payment
of cash. These can include the future delivery of goods or services to customers or other
parties. In some cases, there may be difficulties in determining the values of the goods or
services to be delivered in the future. We will examine several examples of liabilities that
are settled with non-cash resources.

12.2 Classification
When classifying liabilities, we need to assess two conditions: is the liability financial or
non-financial, and is the liability current or non-current.
Financial or Non-Financial

6

Current Liabilities

IAS 32.11 defines one type of financial liability to be a contractual obligation:
I. to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or
II. to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity (CPA Canada, 2016, IAS 32.11).
A key feature of this definition is that the obligation is created by a contract. This means
that there needs to be some type of business relationship between the parties. Liabilities
that are created by laws, such as taxation liabilities, do not meet this definition. Other
types of non-financial liabilities include unearned revenues, warranty obligations, and
customer loyalty programs. These are non-financial because the obligation is to deliver
goods or services in the future, rather than cash.
Financial liabilities will normally be initially measured at their fair value, and many will be
subsequently measured at their amortized cost. (Note: this definition will be expanded in a
later chapter covering complex financial instruments.) Non-financial liabilities are normally
measured at the amount the entity would pay to settle the obligation, or to transfer it to a
third party. This definition presumes that the entity would act in rational manner (i.e., the
presumed settlement is arm’s length, non-distressed, and orderly). The determination of
this amount will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
Current or Non-Current
One of the essential characteristics of a classified balance sheet is the distinction between current and non-current items. This distinction is useful to readers of the financial
statements as it helps them to understand the demands on the entity’s resources and the
potential timing of future cash flows. This information may have an effect on the readers’
decisions, so an understanding of this classification is important.
IAS 1 requires the use of current and non-current classifications for both assets and
liabilities, unless a presentation in order of liquidity is reliable and more relevant. IAS
1.69 defines liability as current when:
• The entity expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle.
• The entity holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading.
• The liability is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period.
• The entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
at least 12 months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could, at the
option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments
do not affect its classification. (CPA Canada, 2016, IAS 1.69).

12.3. Current Financial Liabilities

One of the key components of this definition is the operating cycle. A company’s operating
cycle is the time from the acquisition of raw materials, goods, and other services for
processing, to the time when cash is collected from the sale of finished goods and
services. This cycle can vary greatly between industries. For example, a grocery store,
which sells perishable food products, would have a very short operating cycle, perhaps
only a few weeks, while a shipbuilding company may take several years to complete and
sell a single vessel. For those liabilities that are part of the company’s working capital,
the operating cycle would be the primary determinant of the current classification, even
if settlement occurs more than 12 months after the year-end. For other liabilities that are
not part of the company’s working capital, the other elements of the definition would be
applied. In some cases, the operating cycle may not be obvious or well defined. In these
cases, the operating cycle would normally be assumed to be 12 months. Keep the criteria
for current classification in mind as we examine more detailed examples of these current
liabilities.

12.3 Current Financial Liabilities
12.3.1 Trade Accounts Payable
Trade accounts payable are likely the most common current liability presented in company
financial statements. The balance results from the purchase of goods and services
from suppliers and other entities on account. A typical business arrangement would first
involve the supplier approving the purchasing company for credit. Once this is done, the
purchasing company would be allowed to purchase goods or services up to a maximum
amount, with payment required within some specified period of time. Typical terms would
require payment within 30 to 60 days from the date of purchase. Many suppliers will also
encourage early payment by offering a discount if payment is received within a shorter
time period, often as little as 10 days. These types of arrangements were previously
discussed in the cash and receivables chapter. From the perspective of the purchaser,
the amount of any discount earned by early payment should be deducted directly from
the cost of the inventory purchased or any other asset/expense account debited in the
transaction.
One issue that accountants need to be concerned with is ensuring that accounts payable
are recorded in the correct accounting period. A basic principle of accrual accounting
is that expenses should be recorded in the period in which the goods or services are
consumed or received. This means that the liability for those purchases must also be
recorded in the same period. For this reason, accountants will be very careful during the
period immediately before and after a reporting date to ensure that the cut off of purchase
transactions has been properly completed. The issue of goods-in-transit at the reporting
date was previously discussed in detail in the inventory chapter.

12.3.2 Lines of Credit
Management of operating cash flows is an essential task that must be executed efficiently
and effectively in all companies. The nature of the company’s operating cycle will determine how long the company needs to finance its operations, as cash from sales will not
be immediately collected. Many companies will negotiate an agreement with their banks
that allows them to borrow funds on a short-term basis to finance operations. A line of
credit essentially operates as a regular bank account, but with a negative balance. A
company will make disbursements of cash through the line of credit to purchase goods,
pay employees, and so on, and when money is received from customers, it will be used
to pay down the balance of the line of credit. At the end of any particular reporting period,
the company’s bank balance may be positive, in which case it would be reported in the
current asset section as cash. If it is negative, for example if the line of credit has been
drawn upon, it would be reported as bank indebtedness in the current liability section.
The line of credit will be governed by a contract with the bank that specifies fees and
interest charged, collateral pledged, reporting requirements, and certain other covenant
conditions that must be maintained (such as maintenance of certain financial ratios).
Because of these contractual conditions, there are a number of disclosure requirements
under IFRS for these types of bank indebtedness. These will be discussed later in the
chapter.
Note as well that another lender related current financial liability is the current portion
of long-term debt. This represents the principal portion of a long-term liability that will
be paid in the next reporting period, and will be covered in more detail in the long-term
financial liabilities chapter.

12.3.3 Notes Payable
In the cash and receivables chapter, we discussed the accounting entries and calculations
for short-term notes receivable. In the case of notes payable, the journal entries are
a mirror of those, as we are simply taking the perspective of the other party in the
transaction. In the example used in the cash and receivables chapter, the note was
issued in exchange for the cancellation of an outstanding trade payable. As well, notes
may sometimes be issued directly for loans received.
If we revisit the Ripple Stream Co. example from the cash and receivables chapter, the
journal entries required by the debtor would be as follows:

IFRS requires the use of the effective interest method for the amortization of zero interest
notes and other financial instruments classified as loans and receivables. Thus, the
journal entries from the perspective of the debtor for these different types of notes will
simply be the reverse of those presented in the Cash and Receivables chapter. They will
follow a similar pattern, as outlined above.

12.3.4 Customer Deposits
Businesses may sometimes require customers to pay deposits in advance of the delivery
of the service or good for which it is contracted. These deposits serve a variety of

10

Current Liabilities

purposes. A common example is a landlord requiring a security deposit that will be
refundable at the end of the lease, if there is no damage to the property. If the property
is damaged, then the deposit will be retained to cover the cost of repairs. Another type of
deposit may be required for special order or custom designed goods. As the vendor may
not be able to fully recover its costs on such contracts if the customer were to cancel, the
deposit is required to ensure the commitment of the customer. As well, utility companies
will often require deposits from customers to cover the cost of any unpaid balances that
may arise if the customer were to move out of premises prior to receiving the final invoice.
Although the circumstances that create these deposits may be different, the accounting
treatment still follows the same basic rules for classification described in Section 12.2. If
the company expects the liability to be settled within the operating cycle, or if the company
has no unconditional right to defer settlement beyond 12 months, then the liability would
be classified as current. If these conditions are not true, then the liability would be
classified as non-current. The individual conditions of the contract would need to be
examined to determine the proper classification.

12.3.5 Sales Tax Payable
Many countries and tax jurisdictions levy sales taxes on the sale of certain products and
services. These types of taxes are often referred to as value-added taxes (VAT) or goods
and services taxes (GST). Although the tax rules in each jurisdiction will vary, the general
approach to these types of taxes will be similar in any location. A sales tax collected by an
entity on the sale of goods or services represents a liability, as the tax is being collected on
behalf of the relevant government authority. To use a simple example, assume a company
sells $500 of professional services to a customer in a jurisdiction that requires a sales tax
of 10% be charged. The journal entry would look like this:
Date

When the sales tax is remitted to the government authority, the sales tax payable account
would be reduced accordingly. These liabilities will usually be classified as current, as the
relevant government authority would normally require payment within a fairly short time
period (usually monthly or quarterly).
When we look at this transaction above, we should also consider the accounting for the
purchaser of the service. The treatment of the tax paid will depend on the rules in the
relevant jurisdiction. If the sales tax is refundable, the payer can claim a credit for the

12.3. Current Financial Liabilities

11

amount paid. If the sales tax is non-refundable, then the payer simply absorbs this cost
into the operations of the business.
Using the example above, the journal entries for the purchaser would be as follows:

When the sales tax is non-refundable, it simply gets included in the relevant expense
account. If the purchase were related to an inventory or a property, plant, and equipment
item, then the tax would be included in the initial cost of acquisition for the asset. In some
jurisdictions, it is possible that both refundable and non-refundable sales taxes will apply
to a particular purchase. In those cases, the two tax amounts will need to be separated
and treated accordingly.

12.3.6 Employee Payables
There are a number of current liabilities reported with respect to the employees of the
business. Some of these liabilities will be discussed below.
Salaries and Wages Payable
Any amounts owing to employees for work performed up to the end of the accounting
period need to be accrued and reported. For employees who are paid an hourly wage,
the amount is simply determined by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours
worked since the last pay date, up to the reporting date. For salaried employees, the
calculation is usually performed by determining a daily or weekly rate and then applying
that rate to the appropriate number of days. Consider the following example: an employee
receives an annual salary of $60,000 and is paid every two weeks. The last pay period
ended on May 26, and the company reports on a May 31 year-end. The amount of salary
to accrue would be calculated as follows:

12

Current Liabilities

Annual salary
Bi-weekly salary (÷ 26 weeks)
Amount accrued, May 27–31 (5 days)

$ 60,000
$2,307.69
$1,153.85

Note that when an employee is paid a bi-weekly salary, it is normally presumed that the
work week is 5 days and that the pay period is 10 days (i.e., 2 work weeks). Thus, we
accrue one-half of the regular bi-weekly pay in this example. The accrued amount would
be reversed in the following accounting period when the next salary payment is made.
Payroll Deductions
Payroll deductions, also referred to as source deductions, are a common feature in most
jurisdictions. Government authorities will often levy income taxes on employment income
and will require the employer to deduct the required amount directly from the employee’s
pay. Thus, the amount is deducted at the source. The amount deducted by the employer
represents a type of trust arrangement, as the employer is agreeing to submit the funds
to the government on behalf of the employee. As these deductions are required to be
submitted in a timely manner to the relevant government authority, they are reported
as current liabilities. Additionally, aside from income taxes, government authorities may
require other deductions. In Canada, for example, most employees must also pay Canada
Pension Plan and Employment Insurance premiums. For these types of deductions,
the employer must submit a further amount, based on a proportion of the amount the
employee pays. Thus, the company will report a liability greater than the amount deducted
from the employee, with the difference, the employer’s share, representing an expense for
the company.
There are other types of deductions taken from employee’s pay that are not the result of
a government levy. Examples include these instances: employers may provide private
pension plans that require monthly contributions, employees may belong to unions that
require dues payments based on the level of earnings, employees may have extended
health benefits that require payment, or employees may have to pay a monthly fee for
parking. There are numerous examples of employee deductions, and the accounting
treatment of these items will depend on their natures. If the item is deducted in trust for
another party, then the company must report it as a liability. If the amount is not submitted
to a third party, then the employer may report it as either a cost recovery or a revenue
item. Calculations of various types of source deductions can become fairly complex and,
as a result, most companies will employ staff with specialized training to take care of the
accounting for payroll matters.
Paid Absences
Many employers allow their employees time off from work with pay. IAS 19 describes
these kinds of arrangements as paid absences and classifies them into two types: accu-

12.3. Current Financial Liabilities

13

mulating and non-accumulating.
Accumulating paid absences are those that can be carried forward into a future accounting
period if they are not fully used in the current period. An annual vacation entitlement is a
common example of this type of paid absence. Employment law in many jurisdictions requires employers to give a certain amount of time off with pay each year to its employees.
Employers may choose to grant more than the legally required minimum vacation time as
a way to attract and retain high-quality employees. Because the employees earn the paid
vacation time based on the time they work, an obligation and expense is created, even
if the employees haven’t taken the vacation. IAS 19 further distinguishes accumulating
paid absences as being either vesting or non-vesting. Vesting benefits are those for which
the employee is entitled to a payment upon termination of employment, while non-vesting
benefits are those for which no such entitlement exists. In the case of paid vacation,
the minimum legally required vacation time would be considered a vesting benefit, while
any additional vacation granted by the employer may or may not be considered vesting,
depending on the terms of the employment contract. IAS 19 requires that a liability be
established for both vesting and non-vesting accumulating benefits. This means that the
entity needs to make an estimate of the additional amount that needs to be paid at the
end of the reporting period for the unused entitlement to accumulating paid absences. For
those paid absences that are non-vesting, the entity would need to estimate the amount
that won’t be paid out due to employee termination. This could be done by examining
past employee turnover patterns or other relevant data.
Consider the following example. Norstar Industries employs 100 people who are each
paid $1,000 per week. By December 31, 2015, each employee has earned two weeks
of vacation that are considered vesting and a further week of vacation that is considered
non-vesting. Note that no vacation was taken by the employees during 2015. Based on
past history, the company estimates that 5% of its employees will leave before taking their
vacation, thus losing their entitlement to the non-vesting portion. As well, the company
has budgeted for a 3% salary increase to take effect on January 1, 2016. The liability for
vacation pay would be calculated as follows:
Vesting benefit:
Non-vesting benefit:
Total obligation

100 employees × $1,030 per week × 2 weeks
95 employees × $1,030 per week × 1 week

=
=
=

$206,000
97,850
$303,850

Note that the calculation is based on the pay rate that is expected to be in effect when
the employees take their vacation. The total obligation would be reported as a current
liability and an expense on the December 31, 2015 financial statements. In 2016, as
the employees take their vacation, the liability would be reduced. If the estimates of
employee terminations or salary increases were incorrect, then the expense in 2016 would
be adjusted to reflect the actual result. No adjustment to the previous year’s accrual would
be made.

14

Current Liabilities

Non-accumulating paid absences refer to those entitlements that are lost if they are not
used. Sick days often fall into this category. Employees may be allowed a certain number
of sick days per month or year, but these do not accumulate beyond the end of the relevant
period. Additionally, employees are not entitled to a cash payment for unused amounts
if their employment is terminated. Other common examples of non-accumulating paid
absences include the following: parental leave (maternity, paternity, or adoption), leave
for public service (e.g., jury duty), and some short-term disability leaves. In these cases,
the company does not accrue any expense or liability until the absence actually occurs.
This makes sense as it is not the employee’s service that creates the obligation, but rather
the event itself.
Profit-Sharing and Bonus Plans
In addition to regular salary payments, companies often establish bonus plans for their
employees. These plans may be made available to all employees, or there may be different schemes for different groups. The purpose of a bonus plan is to motivate employees
to work toward the best interests of the company and of its shareholders. Bonus plans
and profit-sharing arrangements are, therefore, intended to act as a method to relieve the
agency theory problem that was discussed in the review chapter.
Bonuses will usually be based on some measurable target and often rely on accounting
information for their calculation. A common example would be to pay out employee
bonuses as a certain percentage of reported profit. The individual employee’s entitlement
to a bonus will be based on some measurable performance objective that should be
determined and communicated at the start of the year. As bonuses are really just another
form of employee remuneration, IAS 19 requires them to be accrued and expensed in
the year of the employee’s service, assuming they can be reasonably estimated. IAS 19
also notes that bonuses may result from both legal and constructive obligations. Thus,
even though the company’s employment contracts may not specify a bonus calculation,
consistent past practices of paying bonuses may create a constructive obligation. The
calculation used in the past would then form the basis for the current accrual. IAS 19
also requires accrual of the amount expected to be paid out for the bonuses. That is, if a
bonus payment is only paid to employees who are still employed at the end of the year,
the calculation of the accrued bonus will need to consider the number of employees who
leave before the end of the year.
Consider the following example. A company with 25 employees has historically paid
out a bonus each year of 5% of the pre-tax profit. The current year’s pre-tax profit is
$1,000,000. The bonus will be paid out two months after the year-end, but employees will
only receive the bonus if they are still employed at that time. In prior years, the company
has experienced, on average, the departure of two employees between the year-end
and the bonus payment. Bonuses not paid to departed employees are retained by the
company and not redistributed to the other employees. The amount to be accrued at
year-end would be calculated as follows:

12.4. Current Non-Financial Liabilities

Total bonus:

12.4 Current Non-Financial Liabilities
As described in Section 12.2, non-financial liabilities are those liabilities that are settled
through the delivery of something other than cash. Often, the liability will be settled by the
delivery of goods or services in a future period. Examples include: unearned revenues,
product warranties, and customer loyalty programs. For these types of liabilities, the
determination of the amount to be settled, and the timing of the settlement, may not
always be clear. However, because a present obligation exists, the liability must still be
recorded. We will examine several examples of non-financial liabilities and consider the
related measurement and accounting issues.

12.4.1 Unearned Revenues
One of the most common non-financial liabilities is unearned revenue. Unearned revenue
results when a customer makes a payment in advance of receiving a good or a service.
Examples include the following: prepayment for a magazine subscription, purchase of
season tickets for a sports team, prepayment for airline flights that will be taken in the
future, annual dues for a recreational club, prepaid maintenance contracts, and gift cards
sold by retail stores. In these examples, the key feature is that the money is paid by the
customer prior to receiving any goods or services from the vendor. Because the vendor
has a performance obligation to provide these items in the future, the amount received
must be recorded as a liability, usually described as unearned revenue. The unearned
revenue should be reported at the fair value of the outstanding obligation and will be
reclassified as revenue as the goods or services are provided. In most cases, the fair
value will be equal to the cash received, as the transaction is normally presumed to be
negotiated by arm’s length parties and is not expected to extend far into the future, that is,
no discounting is required. For unearned revenues resulting from the sale of gift cards by
retail stores, an estimate will need to be made of the number of gift cards that will not be

16

Current Liabilities

redeemed, as some customers will never use the cards and, therefore, the store will never
deliver the goods or services. This estimate affects the fair value of the total obligation
and can usually be determined by examining historical redemption patterns.
Consider the following example of a magazine subscription. Motoring Monthly sold 1,000
one-year subscriptions to its magazine in June 2015, and a further 2,000 one-year subscriptions in September 2015. The magazine is published monthly, and the price of a oneyear subscription is $40. Delivery of the magazines commences in the month following
payment. The following journal entries would be recorded in 2015:

To summarize, the company will report the following amount as a current liability on its
balance sheet as at December 31, 2015:
Unearned subscription revenue
$80,000
($40,000 × 6 ÷ 12 + $80,000 × 9 ÷ 12)

The company will also report the following amount as revenue on its income statement for
the year ended December 31, 2015:
Subscription revenue
$40,000
($40,000 × 6 ÷ 12 + $80,000 × 3 ÷ 12)

On the income statement, the company would also report the costs to produce and
distribute the magazine to properly convey the gross margin earned on the sales.

12.4.2 Product Warranties
As a way to promote sales and develop customer loyalty, many businesses will offer a
warranty on their products. A warranty will obligate the company to repair the product
if it doesn’t function correctly, or replace it if it cannot be fixed. While there are many
limitations to warranty arrangements, including time limits, the contract with the customer
does obligate the company to deliver the goods or services in the future, assuming the
requisite conditions have been met. If the warranty arrangement does not meet definition
of a distinct service under IFRS 15, a separate performance obligation is not created. In
this case, the warranty will be accounted for as a provision under IAS 37 and a result,
the company will required to recognize this obligation as a liability on the balance sheet.
As before, the obligation should be reported at its fair value. This approach, sometimes
referred to as the expense approach, will be discussed further in Section 12.5. In some
cases, the value of the warranty may be explicitly stated, as is the case with extended
warranties that require separate payment from the product itself, such as those sold by
automobile retailers. In other cases, however, the price of the warranty may be implicitly
included with the total sale price of the product. This is essentially a bundled sale, which
was discussed previously in the revenue chapter. If you recall the treatment of bundled
sales, the value of each component should be determined using the relative stand-alone
selling prices of those components, and then recorded as revenue or unearned revenue
as appropriate. This approach is often referred to as the revenue approach.
Consider the following example. Calvino Cars manufactures and sells new automobiles.
Included with every sale is a two-year comprehensive warranty that will cover the cost
of any repairs due to mechanical failure. The company recently sold a unit of its most
popular model, the Cosimo, for $30,000. This price includes the two-year warranty. Based

18

Current Liabilities

on analysis of similar arrangements at other car companies that sell separate warranties,
Calvino Cars estimates that the stand-alone selling price of this warranty is $1,500. The
company has also estimated that 25% of the cost of warranty repairs will be incurred in
the first year of the warranty term and 75% in the second year. The journal entry at the
time of sale would be:

The first journal entry recognizes the revenue from the warranty, based on the expected
pattern of costs to service the warranty. The second journal entry records the actual
costs of the repairs made. In the second year, the remaining revenue ($1,500 × 75% =
$1,125) will be recognized and any repair costs incurred will be recorded in a similar
fashion. If, after the first year, it is estimated that future repair costs would exceed the
remaining unearned revenue, then an additional liability would need to be established.
This is referred to as an onerous contract, a concept that will be discussed later in the
chapter.

12.4.3 Customer Loyalty Programs
As a method of encouraging repeat business and customer loyalty, many companies offer
loyalty rewards. Often denominated in points, they can be redeemed later for additional
goods or services. For example, many grocery and other retail stores allow customers
to collect points that can be applied against future purchases. Also, airlines quite often
encourage their passengers to collect travel miles that can be applied to future flights.

12.4. Current Non-Financial Liabilities

19

Because there is the potential for an obligation to deliver goods or services in the future,
these loyalty rewards need to be accounted for as a contract liability.
The general principles of IFRS 15 are applied in these cases, which results in the loyalty
reward being considered a separate performance obligation of the sales transaction. It
is quite likely that an active market for the loyalty points does not exist, so some type of
estimation technique is required to determine the stand-alone selling price of the rewards.
IFRS 15 suggests that the estimate of the stand-alone selling price of the loyalty points
should reflect the discount the customer is expected to obtain by using the points, adjusted
for:
• the discounts that could otherwise be received by customers without using the
loyalty points; and
• the likelihood that the loyalty points will used
Obviously there is some judgment required in making these fair value determinations.
Let’s look at an example involving a premium car wash. Sudz offers car wash and detailing
services for all types of passenger vehicles. To encourage repeat business, the company
awards points for each car wash, which can be redeemed in the future for additional car
washes or for upgraded services, such as glass repair and scratch buffing. In 2015, the
company earned $2,000,000 in revenue from car washes and awarded 10,000 points.
The stand-alone selling price of the car washes is $2,000,000. Based on an examination
of the awards chosen by customers in the past, the company has estimated the standalone selling price of the points awarded at $12,150. As well, the company expects that
10% of the award points will never be redeemed. In 2016, 7,000 points are redeemed
and in 2017, 2,000 points are redeemed. The journal entries to record these transactions
are as follows:

Car washes = $2,000,000 × ($2,000,000 ÷ $2,012,150) = $1,987,923
Loyalty points = $2,000,000 × ($12,150 ÷ $2,012,150) = $12,077
b. To determine the loyalty point revenue earned in 2016, we must first determine the
value of a single loyalty point:
$12,077 ÷ (10,000 × 90%) = $1.3419 per point
Thus, revenue earned in 2016 = $1.3419 × 7,000 points = $9,393
c. Revenue earned in 2017 = $1.3419 × 2,000 points − $2,684

Note that the value per point is based on the total unearned revenue divided by the number of points expected to be redeemed, rather than the total number of points awarded. If
the estimates turn out to be incorrect, the revenue will simply be adjusted prospectively in
the current year.

12.5 Provisions and Contingencies
IAS 37 deals specifically with provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets. The
standard defines a provision as a “liability of uncertain timing or amount” (CPA Canada,
2016, IAS 37.10). These uncertainties can create problems for accountants, as the
questions of whether the item should be recorded, and what amount should be used
if it is recorded, do not always have clear answers. In this section we will examine the
general criteria to be used in evaluating provisions and contingencies, and we will look at
two specific examples: product warranties and decommissioning costs.
The key feature of the definition of a provision is the existence of uncertainty. The standard
distinguishes provisions from other current liabilities, such as trade payables and accruals,
on the basis of this uncertainty. In comparison, there is no uncertainty regarding trade
payables, as these are usually supported by an invoice with a due date. Even an accrual
for a monthly utility expense does not contain sufficient uncertainty to be classified as a
provision, as this amount can normally be estimated fairly accurately through examination
of past utility bills. Although there is some uncertainty in this process of estimation, the
uncertainty is far less than in the case of a provision. It is for this reason that IAS 37
requires separate disclosure of provisions, but not regular accruals.
The standard also defines a contingent liability as:

a. a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not wholly within the control of the entity; or

12.5. Provisions and Contingencies

21

b. a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because:
i. It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation; or
ii. The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
(CPA Canada, 2016, IAS 37.10).

A careful reading of this definition will lead us to the conclusion that a contingent liability
does not meet the general definition of a liability. The obligation may not be present due to
the uncertainty of future events, or the uncertainty may make it impossible to determine if
or how many economic resources will be outflowing in the future. For these reasons, the
standard does not allow contingent liabilities to be recognized. A common example of a
contingent liability would be a legal action taken against the company where the outcome
cannot yet be predicted. The court’s decision to be rendered is the uncertain future
event that is not within the entity’s control. However, in some cases, the company’s legal
counsel may conclude that the decision is fairly certain based on the facts, in which case,
recognition of a provision may be warranted. Significant judgment may be required in
evaluating the correct accounting treatment of these situations. Contingent assets, which
are also defined in relation to an uncertain future event, are also not recognized under the
standard. However, there are disclosure requirements for contingent assets and liabilities,
which will be discussed later. If an inflow of economic resources were virtually certain,
however, then the asset would be recognized, as it is no longer considered contingent.
The standard doesn’t define virtual certainty, but in practice it has come to mean a very
high level of probability, usually greater than 95%.
In assessing whether an outflow of resources is probable, the standard defines this term
as meaning that the event is more likely than not to occur. In mathematical terms, this
would mean that the event has a greater than 50% probability of occurring. The standard
also states that no disclosure is required if the probability of the outflow of resources
is remote. This term is not defined in the standard. In practice, when making this
determination most professional accountants will use a guideline of 5–10% maximum
probability.
We can think of the guidance offered by IAS 37 in terms of a decision tree:

12.5.1 Product Warranties
In Section 12.4, we looked at an example where the warranty contract was considered
part of a bundled sale and the warranty revenue was recognized separately. In some
cases, the warranty is not considered a separate performance obligation. In these cases,
the warranty revenue would be recognized immediately as part of the total sale. However,
this creates an accounting problem, as there are still potential future costs that will be
incurred in servicing the warranty. In this situation, a provision needs to be established for
those future warranty costs. This provision will help by reporting the expense in the same
period as the related revenue. Let’s return to our example of Calvino Cars, but this time
we will assume that the warranty does not represent a separate performance obligation.
As before, the company estimates that 25% of the warranty repair costs will be incurred
in the first year, and 75% in the second year. As well, based on prior experience with this
car model, the company has estimated that the total cost of repairs for the warranty term
will be $1,100. The journal entries that would be recorded at the time of sale would be:

At the end of the first year, the company will report a current liability of $796 ($1,100 −
$304), which represents the unused portion of the warranty provision. If the warranty
period extended beyond the end of the next operating cycle, then the provision would
need to be separated into current and long-term portions. As it is possible that the actual
warranty costs will not be the same as the predicted costs, an additional adjustment
to profit or loss will be required when the warranty term expires in order to reduce the
provision to zero.
One question the accountant will need to face is how to estimate the future warranty costs.
IAS 37 suggests that the obligation should be reported at the value that the entity would
rationally pay to settle it at the end of the reporting period. This requires some judgment;
however, the standard does supply some guidance on how to estimate this amount. When
the population being estimated contains a large number of items, such as a warranty plan,
the accountant should use the expected value method to determine the amount. This
method looks at all the possible outcomes and applies a probability weighting to each.
For example, if Calvino Cars were to determine the warranty obligation for all of the cars
it sells, it may use the following calculation. If all of the cars sold were to contain minor
defects, then the total cost to repair these defects would be $8,000,000. If all of the cars
sold were to contain major defects, then the total repair costs would be $30,000,000.
Based on experience and engineering studies, the company has determined that 80% of
the cars it sells will have no defects, 17% will have minor defects, and 3% will have major
defects. The warranty provision would then be calculated as follows: (80% ×$0) + (17% ×
$8,000,000) + (3% × $30,000,000) = $2,260,000.
The standard also suggests that when estimating a provision for a single item, the most
likely outcome should be used. However, if the range of possible outcomes is not evenly

24

Current Liabilities

distributed, it may be appropriate to accrue a provision that takes this skewed distribution
into account. In making these judgments, the accountant will need to be aware that the
subjective nature of these estimates may lead to earnings management or other attempts
to manipulate the result. As always, the integrity of the reported amounts depends on the
accountant’s skillful and professional application of the standard.

12.5.2 Decommissioning Costs
In the Property, Plant, and Equipment chpater, we briefly discussed the accounting treatment of decommissioning and site restoration costs. The general approach is to capitalize
these costs as part of the asset’s carrying value and report an obligation, sometimes
referred to as an asset retirement obligation. This obligation represents a provision and is
covered by IAS 37.
The requirement to clean up and restore an industrial site often results from regulation.
In order to obtain permission to operate a business that alters the natural condition of an
area, a government authority may include restrictions in the operating license that require
the restoration of the site, once the industrial activity is concluded. Common examples
include: mineral extraction operations, oilfield drilling, nuclear power plants, gas stations,
and any other businesses that might result in contamination of water or soil. In addition
to the regulatory requirement, IAS 37 also considers the constructive obligation that may
exist as a result of the company’s own actions. If a company has a publicly stated policy
or past practice of restoring industrial sites to a condition beyond the requirements of
legislation, then the company is creating an expectation of similar future performance. As
a result, the amount of the obligation will need to include the costs required to meet the
constructive, as well as the legal, obligations.
Let’s look at an example. Icarus Aviation Ltd. has just purchased a small, existing airport
that provides local commuter flights to downtown businesses in Edwardston. Although the
airport is already 50 years old, the company believes that it can still operate profitably for
another 20 years until it is replaced by a newer airport, at which time the land will be sold
for residential development. To obtain the operating license from the local government,
the company had to agree to decontaminate the site before selling it. It is expected that
this process will cost $10,000,000 in 20 years’ time as the site is heavily polluted with
aviation fuel, de-icing solutions, and other chemicals. Also, the company has publicly
stated that, when the airport is sold, part of the land will be converted into a public park
and returned to the city. It is estimated that the park will cost an additional $2,000,000. As
the company has both legal and constructive obligations, the total site restoration costs of
$12,000,000 need to be recorded as an obligation. Because the costs are to be incurred
in the future, the obligation should be reported at its present value. IAS 37 requires
the use of a discount rate that reflects current market conditions and the risks specific
to the liability. If we assume a 10% discount rate in this case, the present value of the
$12,000,000 obligation is $1,783,724.

The interest expense will increase each year as the obligation increases. At the end of 20
years, the balance in the obligation account will be $12,000,000. Over the 20-year period,
the total amount expensed (interest plus depreciation) will also equal $12,000,000. Thus,
the cost of the site restoration will have been matched to the accounting periods in which
the asset was used.

12.6 Commitments and Guarantees
We have seen in our previous discussions that IFRS requires recognition of assets and
liabilities when certain criteria have been met. In many business transactions, companies

26

Current Liabilities

will enter into contracts that commit them to future actions. If neither party has executed
any part of these contracts at the reporting date, then we would normally not recognize
any asset or liability. However, because the contract will require future actions by both
parties, there is a justification for disclosure, as financial statement readers are interested
in the future profits and cash flows of the business. As such, there are disclosure requirements for certain types of commitments, and, in some cases, there are even recognition
criteria.
An unexecuted contract to purchase property, plant, and equipment is a common commitment that requires disclosures. Even if the contract has not yet been fully executed, IAS
16.74 requires disclosure of the commitment. As PPE expenditures are often irregular and
material, this disclosure helps the financial statement reader understand the potentially
significant effect of the contract on future cash flows.
We previously discussed the concept of an onerous contract. This is a contract for
which the unavoidable future costs of the contract exceed the economic benefits that
are expected. This result is clearly not what the entity originally intended when it entered
into the contract, but circumstances can change and can result in contracts turning into
unprofitable ventures. In determining the unavoidable future costs, the entity should use
the least net cost of exiting the contract, which may be either the cost of fulfilling the
contract or the payment of penalties under the contract for non-performance. When an
onerous contract exists, IAS 37.66 requires the entity to recognize a liability for the amount
of the obligation.
Consider the following example. Rapid Rice Inc., a wholesale distributor of bulk rice
to food manufacturers, has entered into a contract to purchase 1,000,000 kg of rice at
$0.40 per kilogram. The company intends to resell the rice to its customers at $0.50 per
kilogram. If Rapid Rice Inc. cancels the purchase contract before it is fulfilled, it must pay
a penalty of 30% of the total contract value. One month after the contract is signed, but
before any rice is delivered, the vendor reduces the price of rice to $0.30 per kilogram,
due to weak market conditions. Also as a result of these weak market conditions, Rapid
Rice Inc. is forced to reduce the price it charges its customers to $0.37 per kilogram.
Rapid Rice Inc. has the choice of fulfilling the contract and selling at the adjusted price
to its customers, or cancelling the contract and purchasing at the current price to fill its
orders. The following analysis is required to determine if this is an onerous contract:

Expected benefit (1,000,000 × $0.37/kg)
Unavoidable costs (1,000,000 × $0.40/kg)
or (1,000,000 × $0.30/kg)
Penalty (1,000,000 × $0.40/kg) × 30%

A third option would be to simply cancel the contract and not purchase any rice, but this
would result in a net cost of $120,000 (i.e., the penalty). Since all options result in a loss,
this is an onerous contract. The least costly option is to fulfill the contract. The company
will then need to record a provision as follows:

A guarantee is a special type of commitment that requires some type of future performance or payment if another party defaults on an obligation. This type of arrangement
often occurs when two or more companies are under common control. A parent company
may guarantee the bank debt of a subsidiary company. Although the subsidiary company
is the debtor, the guarantee provides additional security to the bank should a default
occur. IAS 39 requires such financial guarantees to be measured initially at the fair value
of the guarantee. Subsequently, the guarantee will be measured at the higher of the best
estimate to settle the obligation and the unamortized premium received by the guarantor.
(It is common for the guarantor to receive a fee for its guarantee.) A discussion of the
measurement of these amounts is beyond the scope of this text. However, it is important
to know that, aside from the measurement issues, there are significant disclosure requirements for guarantees as these arrangements do have the potential to significantly affect
future cash flows.

12.7 Presentation and Disclosure
The topics discussed in this chapter are encompassed by a number of different IFRSes.
As a result, there are a significant number of different disclosure requirements regarding
current liabilities, contingent liabilities, provisions, and guarantees. A guiding principle
that companies should follow when disclosing current liabilities is that there should be
sufficient information to allow the reader to identify the current requirement for cash. This
means that sufficient detail needs to be provided about major types of current liabilities, including amounts owing to related parties and amounts secured by assets of the
company. As well, there are further detailed disclosure requirements for contingencies,
commitments, and guarantees.
IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements) does not specify the order in which current
liabilities should be presented or where on the balance sheet they should be presented.
The standard allows for different formats of presentation as long as information disclosed
is sufficient for the reader to understand the nature and function of the items, and their
impact on the financial position of the company. As a result, an examination of several

28

Current Liabilities

companies reporting under IFRS will reveal different orders of presentation and different
levels of aggregation.
Consider the following two examples, adapted from the balance sheets of a multinational
energy company, and an international chain of grocery stores and hypermarkets. The
energy company presents its current liabilities as the first section in the liabilities and
equity section of the balance sheet, while the grocery chain presents its current liabilities
as the last section. The order of presentation within the classification is different for each
company as well. The grocery chain presents bank debt, or short-term borrowings, first,
while the energy company presents trade and other payables first. These two examples
provide typical disclosures of current liabilities under IFRS, and demonstrate that a variety
of formats are allowable, as long as sufficient and meaningful information is disclosed.

12.8 Analysis
From our previous discussion in the cash and receivables chapter, recall that one way
to evaluate a company’s liquidity is to calculate the quick ratio. This ratio relates the
company’s highly liquid assets (“quick” assets) to its current liabilities. This is an important
measure because a company’s credit rating and reputation can suffer if it cannot pay its
current obligations when they come due. Recall from revenue chapter that our analysis
of Best Coffee and Donuts Inc. revealed a quick ratio of 0.45 in 2016. Ratios in isolation

12.8. Analysis

29

are not particularly meaningful as they need to be compared to a benchmark. However,
in this case, a quick ratio of 0.45 is not to be viewed as a positive result, as it implies that
the company does not have enough highly liquid assets to cover its currently maturing
obligations.
Another measure that can be used to evaluate liquidity is the days’ payables outstanding ratio. This ratio is the mirror image of the days’ sales uncollected ratio calculated
previously. The days’ payables outstanding ratio measures how long it takes the company
to pay its outstanding payables. The ratio is calculated using the following formula:

Days’ payables outstanding = (Trade accounts payable ÷ Purchases on credit) × 365
Purchases on credit is usually not separately disclosed on the financial statements. Often,
the cost of sales figure can be used as an estimate of this amount. However, the individual
characteristics of the company would need to be examined to determine if this is a
reasonable assumption. If we assume that Best Coffee and Donuts Inc.’s cost of sales in
2016 is $1,594,739, then the ratio is calculated as follows:

Days’ payable outstanding = ($204,514 ÷ $1,594,739) × 365 = 46.81 days
Although it is difficult to make any conclusive statement, this calculation shows that the
company has been paying its outstanding payables somewhat slowly. To be fully meaningful, we would need to know the creditors’ normal credit terms and industry averages,
and we would want to calculate the trend over several years. However, it is common for
many creditors to allow 30 days for payment, so it would appear that Best Coffee and
Donuts Inc. is exceeding these terms. Further analysis is needed to determine why this
is happening, and whether this is damaging the company’s relationship with its creditors.
For ratio analysis to be meaningful, a deeper understanding of the business is required.
Best Coffee and Donuts Inc. primarily sells fast food and settles most of its transactions
in cash or near cash (i.e., debit and credit cards). In this industry, inventory items would
be converted fairly quickly to cash, as perishable items cannot be held for long periods of
time. Thus, although the quick ratio appears low, this may not be a serious problem due
to the rapid conversion of inventory to cash. However, the fact that the company has been
paying its accounts payable slowly may indicate a problem. It is important to consider
broader data, including historical trend analysis and industry averages, before drawing
further conclusions, though.

30

Current Liabilities

12.9 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
IFRS
Contingent assets and liabilities are not
recognized because they do not meet the
recognition criteria.

A provision is a liability of uncertain timing
or amount. It is accrued when the future
outflow of economic resources is probable
and a reliable estimate can be made.
Although not defined, “probable” is usually
interpreted as being greater than a 50%
probability.
Provisions are accrued based on the
expected value approach, which assigns
probabilities to each possible outcome.

IFRS 15 provides specific guidance on
customer loyalty programs.
Both legal and constructive obligations for
decommissioning costs are recognized.
Decommissioning costs related to the asset are recognized as part of property,
plant, and equipment. Decommissioning
costs related to subsequent production
are included in inventory.
Disclosure requirements are detailed, and
are included in IAS 1, 19, 32, 37, 39, IFRS
7, and IFRS 15.

ASPE
Contingent losses are recognized when
it is likely that a future event will confirm
the existence of a liability and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. Contingent
gains are not accrued.
Contingent losses that are “likely” are
accrued. A “likely” event is defined as
one whose probability of occurrence, or
non-occurrence, is “high.” This is usually
interpreted as being a higher level of probability than the equivalent IFRS condition.
Where a range of possible outcomes exist,
the amount accrued will be the most likely
amount in the range. If no amount is
more likely than another, then the lowest
amount of the range is accrued.
ASPE does not contain specific guidance
on customer loyalty programs.
Only legal obligations are recognized as
asset retirement obligations.
All costs, both capital and production, are
included in property, plant, and equipment.

Disclosure requirements are less detailed.
Disclosure requirements are included in
sections 1510, 3110, 3280, 3290, 3856,
and AcG 14.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Define current liabilities and account for various types of
current liabilities.
A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of
which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic
benefits. A current liability is one that is expected to be settled within the normal operating

Chapter Summary

31

cycle, or within 12 months, of the balance sheet date. A liability may also be current if
it is held for trading, or if the company does not have the unconditional right to defer
settlement beyond one year. Common current liabilities include accounts payable, lines
of credit, notes payable, customer deposits, and sales tax payable.

LO 2: Differentiate between financial and non-financial current
liabilities.
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset
to another entity, or to exchange financial assets or liabilities under conditions that are
unfavourable to the entity. Non-financial liabilities are those that do not meet this definition.

LO 3: Explain the accounting treatment of different types of current,
financial liabilities.
With accounts payable, an important accounting procedure is ensuring that the liability
is reported in the correct period. Lines of credit usually require a formal agreement with
a lender and, as such, certain disclosures will be required. Notes payable should be
accounted for using the effective interest method. The conditions of individual contracts
with customers need to be examined carefully to determine the correct classification of
deposits received. Sales tax collected on behalf of a government agency represents a
liability, but the liability may be offset for sales tax paid in certain cases. Employee-related
liabilities can include salaries and wages payable, payroll deductions, paid absences,
profit-sharing, and bonus plans. For paid absences, IAS 19 distinguishes between accumulating and non-accumulating absences, and only requires accrual of accumulating
amounts.

LO4: Explain the accounting treatment of different types of current,
non-financial liabilities.
Unearned revenues represent an obligation to provide goods or services in the future
to customers. Unearned revenues are reported as liabilities until such time as they are
recognized as revenues, that is, when the goods or services are provided. Unearned revenues should be reported at their fair values, and are normally not discounted. A product
warranty is a promise to provide future repairs or replacement if a product has defects.
The preferred accounting approach is to treat this as a bundled sale and recognize the
warranty component as unearned revenue. The revenue will then be recognized over
the term of the warranty, matched against the actual expenses incurred to service the

32

Current Liabilities

warranty. If the warranty does not represent a separate performance obligation, then the
liability for future repairs is treated as a provision. A customer loyalty program represents
a separate component of revenue that should be reported at its fair value and deferred as
appropriate. Estimation will likely be required to determine the fair value.

LO 5: Discuss the nature of provisions and contingencies and
identify the appropriate accounting treatment for these.
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision will be accrued when
the future outflow of resources is probable and the amount can be reliably measured.
If one of these conditions is not present, then no amount is accrued but disclosure is
required (except when the probability is remote). When the revenue portion of a product
warranty cannot be determined, a provision for future expected warranty expenditures is
required. The provision will be based on the expected value of the obligation, and will be
accrued at the time of sale of the product. As warranty costs are incurred, the provision
will be reduced. A provision for decommissioning costs needs to be accrued based on
the legal and constructive obligations of the company (only the legal obligation under
ASPE). As the costs may be incurred far into the future, discounting of the obligation is
appropriate. The value of the initial obligation will be added to the cost of the relevant
asset. Every year, interest calculated will be added to the balance of the obligation. Each
year the asset will be depreciated and the interest expense recorded. At the end of the
asset’s life, the balance of the obligation will equal the amount estimated to complete the
decommissioning.

LO 6: Discuss the nature of commitments and guarantees and
identify the appropriate accounting disclosure for these items.
A commitment represents a future action to be taken by the company under an unexecuted contract. Commitments are not normally accrued, as no part of the contract has yet
been executed. However, if they are material, commitments should be disclosed because
they do represent a potential effect on future cash flows. If a contractual commitment
becomes onerous, the least amount required to execute or withdraw from the contract
should be accrued, as this future expenditure cannot be avoided.
Guarantees represent possible future outflows of resources on behalf of another party.
Guarantees are initially measured and recorded at their fair value, and are subsequently
recorded at the greater of the amount required to settle the obligation and the unamortized
premium.

Chapter Summary

33

LO 7: Describe the presentation and disclosure requirements for
various types of current liabilities.
As current liabilities have a direct impact on immediate cash flows, significant disclosure
requirements are detailed in several sections of the IFRSes. The standards do not specify
the precise format of current liability disclosure on the balance sheet, so companies have
adopted a variety of practices regarding the order of presentation and terminology used.

LO 8: Use ratio analysis of current liabilities to supplement the
overall evaluation of a company’s liquidity.
The days’ payables outstanding ratio can be used in conjunction with the current and
quick ratios to draw some conclusions about a company’s liquidity. However, a broader
understanding of the nature of the business, industry standards, historical trends, and
other factors is required to draw proper conclusions.

LO 9: Identify differences in the accounting treatment of current
liabilities between IFRS and ASPE.
There are some differences between IFRS and ASPE with respect to contingencies and
provisions, customer loyalty programs, and decommissioning costs. ASPE disclosure
requirements are less detailed than IFRS requirements.

Kercher Imports Inc. purchases large quantities of precious minerals in Asia that are then
resold to various European end-use customers. The company has recently entered into a
contract to purchase 10,000 grams of a particular mineral at a price of $50 per gram.
The company intends to resell the mineral to its customers at $90 per gram. Soon
after the contract was signed, the civil war in the mineral’s source country ended and
a stable government was installed. This result calmed the markets, and the spot price for
the mineral dropped to $31 per gram. Kercher Imports Inc. examined the contract and
determined that to exit the arrangement early would result in a penalty of $75,000. As
a result of the change in the market price, Kercher Imports Inc. can now only sell the
product to its end-users at $45 per gram.
Required:
a. Determine if this is an onerous contract. Prepare the journal entry required to report
this contract.

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

Leveraging and Debt – Can it be a Smart Move?
In simple terms, leveraging is borrowing to invest, in the hopes that the investment
will generate a higher rate of return than the interest rate of the debt. The investment
that is financed by debt may be intended to increase a company’s corporate wealth by
expanding its market share, or adding new product lines to increase net income. It can
also involve investing in other companies’ shares to enhance a special relationship
or receive share dividends and capital appreciation of the shares as a return on
investment. No matter the reason, there are important aspects of leveraging that
must be considered before entering into such an arrangement.
1. Does the company currently generate enough net income and hold enough
assets to service the proposed leveraging strategy?
2. Is leveraging the best strategy, given alternative financing arrangements such as
increasing equity by issuing more shares?
3. Does management clearly understand the risks of taking on a leveraging strategy or is the decision driven more by emotions than by careful consideration?
4. Since leveraging increases the debt burden, will this impact any existing
restrictive debt covenants from other creditors?
5. Does the company have sufficient business processes in place to adequately
monitor and measure the return of the investment funded by the additional debt?
This must be done to ensure that the return from the investment exceeds the
interest rate of the debt itself.
6. If the investment’s return is less than expected, does the company have
enough net income and other resources to keep the investment in hopes of
an improvement in the future?
7. Is the company diversified enough to achieve a balance between the leveraged
investment and its other sources of funds and operations?

13.1 Long-Term Financial Liabilities: Overview
Most businesses will incur debt at some point during their existence. For example, new
businesses may be required to borrow start-up cash to purchase revenue-generating
assets as they do not yet have any cash holdings accumulated from profits. Or, existing
companies may want to expand their operations, or they may want to replenish depleted
cash holdings that resulted from a temporary downturn in business. Additionally, companies with large infrastructures, such as airlines or railways, may require more cash for their
capital projects than what can be generated from normal operations. Whatever the case,
businesses can obtain the additional cash they need through various financing activities.
Three sources of such financing are:

46

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

1. Using internally generated free cash flow: Cash from previous sales cycles
Purchase assets
Sales
Accounts receivable
Cash
Source of cash from within operations
2. Borrowing from creditors: Cash from borrowings
Sales
Accounts receivable
Cash

Purchase assets

Source of cash from acquiring debt (short-term or long-term)
3. Issuing capital shares: Cash from borrowings
Sales
Accounts receivable

Purchase assets
Cash

Source of cash from investors (equity)

As shown above, cash obtained from any of the three financing sources can be invested
into assets that a company hopes will generate sales and, ultimately, a cash profit. Additionally, each source of financing has its own advantages. For example, using internallygenerated funds is the easiest to access but it misses the opportunity to maximize profits
through leveraging, as explained in the opening story. As previously discussed, leveraging
means using a creditor’s cash to generate a profit where the interest rate from the creditor
is less than the return generated by operating profits. However, care must be taken to
ensure that the best method is used from the choices available on a case-by-case basis.
Consider that while borrowing from creditors can result in desirable leveraging, it can also
increase the liquidity and solvency risk, as borrowings are obligations that must be repaid.
Also, while issuing shares doesn’t affect liquidity or solvency, as they are not repayable
obligations, issuing more shares results in diluted ownership for the shareholders, which
could result in less dividends or a lower market price for the shares. There are also
tax implications when choosing between debt and equity sourced financing since interest
expense from holding debt is deductible for tax purposes while dividends paid for shares
are not.
Long-term debt, such as bonds and long-term notes (including mortgages payable) are
examples of financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are the financial obligation to deliver
cash, or other assets, in a determinable amount to repay an obligation. They are also
monetary liabilities because they represent a claim to cash where the amount is fixed by
contract. Financial assets and liabilities share the same mirror image characteristic: that
a long-term note payable reported on the balance sheet of the borrowing company will be
reported as a long-term note receivable on the balance sheet of the creditor company.

13.2 Notes Payable
Recognition and Measurement of Notes Payable

13.2. Notes Payable

47

A note payable is an unconditional written promise to pay a specific sum of money to
the creditor, on demand or on a defined future date. It is supported by a formal written
promissory note. These notes are negotiable instruments in the same way as cheques
and bank drafts.
Notes payable are initially recognized at the fair value on the date that the note is legally
executed (usually upon signing). Subsequent valuation is measured at amortized cost
using the effective interest rate.
Characteristics
A typical note payable requires payment of a specified face amount, also called principal,
and interest, that is paid as a single lump sum at maturity, as a series of payments, or as
a combination of both. (This topic will be discussed later in this chapter.)
Secured notes payable identify collateral security in the form of assets belonging to the
borrower that the creditor can seize if the note is not paid at the maturity date.
Notes may be referred to as interest bearing or non-interest bearing:

• Interest-bearing notes have a stated rate of interest that is payable in addition to the
face value of the note.
• Notes that are zero-bearing or non-interest bearing do not have a stated rate of interest. Although, while they may appear at first glance not to have any interest, there
is always an interest component embedded in the note. The interest component will
be equal to the difference between the borrowed and repaid amounts.

Cash payments vary and can be a single payment of principal and interest upon maturity,
or payment of interest only throughout the term of the note with the principal portion
payable upon maturity, or a mix of interest and principal throughout the term of the note.
Transaction Costs
It is common for notes to incur transaction costs, especially if the note payable is acquired
using a broker as they will charge a commission for their services. For a company using
either ASPE or IFRS, the transaction costs associated with financial liabilities, such as
notes payable that are carried at amortized cost, are to be capitalized, meaning that
the costs will reduce the note payable amount. If the debt is subsequently classified and
measured at its fair value, the transaction costs are to be expensed. This is referred to as
the fair value option and will be discussed later in this chapter.

48

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

Classification
Notes may be classified as short-term (current) or long-term payables on the SFP/BS:

• Short-term notes are current liabilities payable within the next 12 months, or within
the business’s operating cycle if longer than 12 months.
• Long-term notes are notes that do not meet the definition of a current (short-term)
liability. For example, notes with due dates greater than one year.

As previously discussed, the difference between a short-term note and a long-term note is
the length of time to maturity. Also, the process to issue a long-term note is more formal,
and involves approval by the board of directors and the creation of legal documents that
outline the rights and obligations of both parties. These include the interest rate, property
pledged as security, payment terms, due dates, and any restrictive covenants. Restrictive
covenants are any quantifiable measures that are given minimum threshold values that
the borrower must maintain. Additionally, restrictions on minimum working capital (current assets minus current liabilities), management remuneration, capital expenditures, or
dividends paid to shareholders are often found in covenant conditions. Maintenance of
certain ratio thresholds, such as the current ratio or debt to equity ratios, are all common
measures identified in restrictive covenants.
As the length of time to maturity of the note increases, the interest component becomes
increasingly more significant. As a result, any notes payable with greater than one year
to maturity are to be classified as long-term notes and require the use of present values
to estimate their fair value at the time of issuance. A review of the time value of money, or
present value, is presented in the following to assist you with this learning concept.

13.2.1 Long-Term Notes Payable, Interest, and the Time Value of
Money
Long-term notes payable are to be measured initially at their fair value, which is calculated
as the present value amount. But what is present value? It is a discounted cash flow
concept, which we will discuss next.
It is common knowledge that money borrowed from a bank will accrue interest that the
borrower will pay to the bank, along with the principal. The present value of a note payable
is equivalent to the amount of money deposited today, at a given rate of interest, which
will result in the specified future amount that must be repaid upon maturity. The cash
flow is discounted to a lesser sum that eliminates the interest component—hence the
term discounted cash flows. The future amount can be a single payment at the date of

13.2. Notes Payable

49

maturity, a series of payments over future time periods, or a combination of both. Put into
context for notes payables, if a creditor must wait until a future date to receive repayment
for its lending, then note payable’s face value at maturity will not be an exact measure of
its fair value today (transaction date) because of the embedded interest component.
For example, assume that a company purchases equipment in exchange for a two-year,
$5,000 note payable, and that notes of a similar risk have a market rate of 9%. The
face value of the note is therefore $5,000. The note’s present value, without the interest
component, is $4,208.40, not $5,000. The $4,208.40 is the amount that, if deposited
today at an interest rate of 9%, would equal exactly $5,000 at the end of two years. Using
a variables string, the present value of the note can be expressed as:
PV = (9% I/Y, 2N, 5000FV) = $4,208.40
Where I/Y is interest of 9% each year for two years;
N is for the number of years that the interest is compounded;
FV is the payment at the end of two years’ time (future value) of $5,000.

To summarize, the present value (discounted cash flow) of $4,208.40 is the fair value of
the $5,000 note at the time of the purchase. The additional amount received of $791.60
($5,000.00 − $4,208.40) is the interest component paid to the creditor over the life of the
two-year note.
Note: The symbols PV, I/Y, N, FV, and PMT are intended to be a generic reference to the
underlying variables string. Each brand of financial calculator will have its own owner’s
manual that will identify the set of keys for inputting the variables above.
After issuance, long-term notes payable are measured at amortized cost. As illustrated
next, determining present values requires an analysis of cash flows using interest rates
and time lines
Present Values and Timelines
The following timelines will illustrate present value using discounted cash flows. Below
are three different scenarios:

1. Assume that on January 1, Maxwell lends some money to Nictonia in exchange for
a $5,000, five-year note payable as a lump-sum amount at the end of five years.
Notes of similar risk have a market interest rate of 5%. Additionally, Maxwell’s yearend is December 31. The first step is to identify the amount(s) and timing of all the
cash flows as illustrated below on the timeline. Inputting the variables into a financial
calculator, the amount of money that Maxwell would be willing to lend to the borrower
using the present value calculation of the cash flows would be $3,917.63.

Present Value (PV) = $3,917.63
PV = (5 I/Y, 5 N, 5000 FV)
where I/Y is interest

FV is future value

In this case, Maxwell would be willing to lend $3,917.63 today in exchange for a
payment of $5,000 at the end of five years, at an interest rate of 5% per annum.
Nictonia’s entry for the note payable at the date of issuance would be:

Notes of this nature are often referred to as zero-interest or non-interest-bearing
notes. This is a misnomer, however, as all debt transactions between unrelated
third parties will bear interest based on market interest rates. For example, note
that Maxwell lends $3,917.63 now and collects $5,000 at the end of five years. The
difference of $1,082.37 represents the interest component over the five years.
2. Now assume that on January 1, Maxwell lends an amount of money in exchange
for a $5,000, five-year note. The current market rate for similar notes is 5%. The
repayment of the note is $1,000 at the end of each year for the next five years
(present value of an ordinary annuity). The amount of money that Maxwell would be
willing to lend Nictonia using the present value calculation of the cash flows would
be $4,329.48, as follows:

Note that in this example Maxwell is willing to lend more money, $4,329.48 as
compared to $3,917.63, to Nictonia. Another way of looking at it would be that
the interest component embedded in the note is less in this case. This makes sense
as the principal amount of the note is being slowly reduced over its five-year term
due to of the yearly payments of $1,000. In other words, the higher the frequency
of payments, the lower the interest component will be. This is the same concept as
with a mortgage owing for a house. It is common for financial advisors to say that a
mortgage payment paid twice a month, instead of a single payment once a month,
will result in a significant reduction in interest costs over the term of the mortgage.
The bottom line is that if the principal amount owing at any time over the life of a
note is reduced, there will be less interest charged overall. Another name for a note
with equal payments of interest and principal is an instalment or blended payment
note.
3. How would the amount of the loan and the entries above differ if Maxwell received
five equal payments of $1,000 at the beginning of each year (present value of an
annuity due) instead of at the end of each year, as shown in example 2? The
amount of money that Maxwell would be willing to lend Nictonia using the present
value calculation of the cash flows paid at the beginning of the period (P/AD generic
symbol) would be $4,545.95, as follows:

Again, the interest component will be less because a payment is paid immediately upon
execution of the note, which causes the principal amount to be reduced sooner than a
payment made at the end of each year.
Below is a comparison of the three scenarios:
Scenario 1
Single payment
at maturity
Face value of the note
Less: present value of the note
Interest component

$ 5,000
3,918
$ 1,082

Scenario 2

$ 671

Scenario 3
Five payments of
$1,000 at the beginning
of each month
$ 5,000
4,546
$
454

Note that the interest component decreases for each of the scenarios even though the
total cash repaid is $5,000 in each case. This is due to the timing of the cash flows,
as discussed earlier. In scenario 1, the principal is not reduced until maturity and interest
would accrue for the full five years of the note. In scenario 2, the principal is being reduced

13.2. Notes Payable

53

at the end of each year, so the interest will decrease due to the decreasing balance owing.
In scenario 3, there is an immediate reduction of principal because of the first payment
of $1,000 made upon issuance of the note. The remaining four payments are made at
the beginning of each year instead of at the end. This results in a faster reduction in the
principal amount owing as compared with scenario 2.
Present Values With Unknown Variables
As is the case with any algebraic equation, if all variables except one are known, the final
unknown variable can be derived. In the case of present value calculations, if any four of
the five variables in the following equation
PV = (PMT, I/Y, N, FV)
are known, the fifth unknown variable amount can be determined using a financial calculator or an Excel net present value function. For example, if the interest rate (I/Y) is not
known, it can be derived if all the other variables in the variables string are known. This
will be illustrated when non-interest-bearing long-term notes payable are discussed later
in this chapter.
Present Values: When Stated Interest Rates Are Different Than Effective (Market)
Interest Rates
Differences between the stated interest, or face rate, and the effective, or market, rate at
the time a note is issued can have accounting consequences as follows:

• If the stated interest rate of the note, (i.e., the interest rate that the note pays) is 10%
at a time when the effective interest rate (also called the market rate or yield) is 10%
for notes with similar characteristics and risk, the note is initially recognized as:
Face value = Fair value = Present value of the note
This makes intuitive sense since the stated rate of 10% is equal to the market rate
of 10%.
• If the stated interest rate is 10%, and the market rate is 11%, the stated rate is lower
than the market rate and the note is trading at a discount.
• If the stated interest rate is 10%, and the market rate is 9%, the stated rate is higher
than the market rate and the note is trading at a premium.

The premium or discount amount is to be amortized over the term of the note.
Below are the acceptable methods to amortize discounts or premiums:

54

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

• If a company follows IFRS, the effective interest method of amortization is required,
which we will discuss in the next section.
• If a company follows ASPE, the amortization method is not specified, so either
straight-line amortization or the effective interest method is appropriate as an accounting policy choice.
Here are some examples with journal entries involving various face value, or stated rates,
compared to market rates.
1. Notes issued at face value
Assume that on January 1, Carpe Diem Ltd. lends $10,000 to Fascination Co. in
exchange for a $10,000, three-year note, bearing interest at 10% payable annually
at the end of each year (ordinary annuity). The market interest rate for a note of
similar risk is also 10%. The note’s present value is calculated as:
Face value of the note
Present value of the note principal and interest:
Payment = $10,000 × 10% = $1,000 PMT
PV = (1000 PMT, 10 I/Y, 3 N, 10000 FV)

In this case, the note’s face value and present value, or fair value, are the same
($10,000) because the effective, or market, and stated interest rates are the same.

2. Stated rate lower than market rate – a discount
Assume that Anchor Ltd. makes a loan to Sizzle Corp. in exchange a $10,000,
three-year note, bearing interest at 10% payable annually. The market rate of

13.2. Notes Payable

55

interest for a note of similar risk is 12%. Recall that the stated rate of 10% determines the amount of the cash paid for interest. However, the present value
uses the effective (market) rate to discount all cash flows to determine the amount
to record as the note’s value at the time of issuance. The note’s present value is
calculated as:
Face value of the note
Present value of the note principal and interest:
Payment = $10,000 × 10% = $1,000 PMT
PV = (1000 PMT, 12 I/Y, 3 N, 10000 FV)
Discount amount

$10,000

9,520
$ 480

As shown above, the note’s stated rate (10%) is less than the market rate (12%), so
the note is issued at a discount.

Even though the face value of the note is $10,000, the amount of money lent to
Sizzle Corp. would only be $9,520. This considers the discount amount due to the
difference between the stated and market interest rates discussed earlier. In return,
Sizzle Corp. will pay to Anchor Ltd. an annual cash payment of $1,000 for three
years, plus a lump sum payment of $10,000 at the end of the third year when the
note matures. The total cash payments will be $13,000 over the term of the note,
and the interest component of the note would be:
Cash paid
Present value (fair value)
Interest component

$13,000

As mentioned earlier, if Sizzle Corp. follows IFRS, the $480 discount amount would
be amortized using the effective interest rate method. If Sizzle Corp. follows ASPE,
there would be a choice between the effective interest method and the straight-line
method.
Below is a schedule that calculates the cash payments, interest expense, discount
amortization, and the carrying amount (book value) of the note at the end of each
year using the effective interest method:

Note that the total discount amortized of $480 in the schedule is equal to the discount originally calculated as the difference between the face value of the note and
the present value of the note principal and interest. Also, the amortization amount
calculated each year is added to the note’s carrying value, thereby increasing its
carrying amount until it reaches its maturity value of $10,000. As a result, the
carrying amount at the end of each period is always equal to the present value of the
note’s remaining cash flows discounted at the 12% market rate. This is consistent
with the accounting standards for the subsequent measurement of long-term notes
payable at the amortized cost.
Assuming that Sizzle Corp.’s year-end was the same date as the note’s interest paid,
at the end of year 1, using the schedule above, Sizzle Corp.’s entry would be:

Alternatively, if Sizzle Corp. followed ASPE the straight-line method of amortizing the
discount is simple to apply. The total discount of $480 is amortized over the threeyear term of the note in equal amounts. The annual amortization of the discount is
$160 ($480 ÷ 3 years) for each of the three years, as shown in the following entry:

Comparing the three years’ entries for both the effective interest and the straightline methods, the following pattern for amortization over the life of the note payable
is shown below:

The amortization of the discount using the effective interest method results in increasing amounts of interest expense that will be recorded in the adjusting entry
(decreasing amounts of interest expense for amortizing a premium) compared to
the equal amounts of interest expense using the straight-line method. The straightline method is easier to apply but its shortcoming is that the interest rate (yield) for
the note is not held constant at the 12% market rate as it is with the effective interest
method. This is because the amortization of the discount is in equal amounts and
does not take into consideration what the carrying amount of the note was at any
period of time. However, at the end of year 3, the notes payable balance is $10,000
for both methods, and so the same entry is recorded for the payment of the cash.

3. Stated rate more than market rate – a premium
Had the note’s stated rate of 10% been greater than a market rate of 9%, the
present value of $10,253 would be greater than the face value of the note due to
the premium. The same types of calculations and entries as shown in the previous
illustration would be used. Note that the premium amortized each year would decrease the carrying amount of the note at the end of each year until it reaches its
face value amount of $10,000.

4. Zero-interest-bearing notes
Some companies will issue zero-interest-bearing notes as a sales incentive. While
they do not state an interest rate, the term zero-interest is inaccurate as the notes do
include an interest component that is equal to the difference between the cash lent
and the higher amount of cash repaid at maturity. Even though the interest rate is
not stated, the implied interest rate can be derived because the cash amounts lent
and received are both known. In most cases, the transaction between the issuer
and acquirer of the note is at arm’s length, so the implicit interest rate would be a
reasonable estimate of the market rate.
Assume that on January 1, Eclipse Corp. received a five-year, $10,000 zero-interestbearing note from Galaxy Ltd. The amount of cash lent to Galaxy Ltd., which is equal
to the present value, is $7,835 (rounded). Galaxy Ltd.’s year-end is December 31.
Looking at the cash flows and the timeline:

Present Value (PV) = ($7,835)
Interest
I/Y = (+/-7835 PV, 5 N, 10000 FV)
where I/Y is interest
PV is the amount of cash lent
N is # of periods
FV is the future cash received
Interest = 5% (rounded), or $2,165

Note that the sign for the $7,835 PV is preceded by the +/- symbol, meaning that the
PV amount is to have the opposite symbol to the FV amount. Also, FV is the cash
paid at maturity, while the PV is the amount of cash lent to the note issuer. Many
financial calculators require the use of a +/- sign for one value, and no sign for the
other, to correctly calculate imputed interest rates. Consult your calculator manual
for further instructions regarding zero-interest note calculations.
The implied interest rate is calculated to be 5% and the note’s interest component
(rounded) is $2,165 ($10,000 - $7,835), which is the difference between the cash
lent and the higher amount of cash repaid at maturity. Below is the schedule for the

If Galaxy Ltd. followed ASPE instead of IFRS, the entry using the straight-line method
for amortizing the discount is calculated as the total discount of $2,164.74, amortized over the 5-year period term of the note resulting in equal amounts each year.
Therefore, the annual amortization is $432.95 ($2,164.74 ÷ 5 years) each year:

5. Notes Payable in Exchange for Property, Goods, or Services
When property, goods, or services are exchanged for a note, and the market rate
and the timing and amounts of cash paid are all known, the present value of the
note can be determined. For example, assume that on May 1, Hudson Inc. receives
a $200,000, 5-year note from Xertoc Corp. in exchange for land that originally cost
$120,000. If the market rate for a note with similar characteristics and risks is 8%,
the present value is calculated as follows:

PV = (8 I/Y, 5 N, 200000 FV)
PV = $136,117
Xertoc Corp.’s entry upon issuance of the note and purchase of the land would be:

However, if the market rate is not known, either of following two approaches can be used
to determine the fair value of the note:

1. Determine the fair value of the property, goods, or services received. As was
discussed for zero-interest-bearing notes where the interest rate was not known,
the implicit interest rate can still be derived because the cash amount lent, and the
timing and amount of the cash flows paid from the issuer are both known. In this
case the amount lent is the fair value of the property, goods, or services given up.
Once the interest is calculated, the effective interest method can be applied. 1
For example, on June 1, Mayflower Consulting Ltd. receives a $40,000, three-year
note from Norfolk Ltd. in exchange for some land. The market rate cannot be
accurately determined due to some credit risks regarding Norfolk Ltd. The land fair
value on the transaction date is $31,750. The imputed interest rate is calculated as
follows:

I/Y = (+/- 31750 PV, 3 N, 40000 FV)
I/Y = 8%
and the interest expense component is $8,250 over three years ($40,000−$31,750).
Norfolk Ltd.’s entry upon issuance of the note would be:

2. Determine an imputed interest rate. An imputed interest rate is an estimated
interest rate used for a note with comparable terms, conditions, and risks between
an independent borrower and lender.
1

According to IAS (2013) “IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement applies to IFRSes that require or permit
fair value measurements or disclosures and provides a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value
and requires disclosures about fair value measurement. The Standard defines fair value based on an ‘exit
price’ notion and uses a ‘fair value hierarchy’, which results in a market-based, rather than entity-specific,
measurement. IFRS 13 was originally issued in May 2011 and applies to annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2013” (para 1). IFRS 13 is beyond the scope of this course. For simplicity, the fair value
of the property, goods, or services given up, as explained in the chapter material, assumes that IFRS 13
assumptions and hierarchy to determine fair values have been appropriately considered.

62

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

On June 1, Edmunds Co. receives a $30,000, three-year note from Virginia Simms Ltd.
in exchange for some swamp land. The land has a historic cost of $5,000 but neither the
market rate nor the fair value of the land can be determined.
In this case, a risk-adjusted rate of return must be determined and subsequently used
to determine the note’s present value (fair value). For companies that follow IFRS, the
fair value hierarchy identified in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement would be used to
determine the appropriate risk adjusted rate of return and the subsequent fair value of
the land. In the absence of a directly comparable market, level 2 or level 3 inputs are
used. This can include present value calculations based on expected future cash flows.
In this case, the future cash flow is the $30,000 note payment. The discount rate should
be determined based on the risk-free rate of return, adjusted for the risk factors of the
transaction. Alternately, use risk-adjusted cash flows, discounted at the risk-free rate.
The calculated PV subsequently becomes the fair value used. In this case, the risk-free
rate of return adjusted for the risk factors for this transaction is determined to be 7%. The
present value is calculated as follows:

PV = (7 I/Y, 3 N, 30000 FV)
PV = $24,489

13.2.2 Subsequent Measurements and Derecognition
As previously discussed, under ASPE and IFRS, long-term notes payable that are held
by debtors are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost, which is calculated as:
• present value of the cash flows, including commissions or fees if any
• +/- reductions in principal or for any adjustments for amortization of the discount or
premium
• derecognition of the debt through retirement or settlement. All premiums or discounts will be fully amortized by the maturity date. The carrying amount at maturity
will be the same as the note’s face value so there will be no gain or loss at maturity
unless the debt is settled early.

13.2. Notes Payable

Impairment
If a debtor runs into financial difficulties and is unable to pay, or fully repay, the note, the
estimated impaired cash flows become an important reporting disclosure for the lender.
If the lender can reasonably estimate the impaired cash flows an entry is made to record
the debt impairment. The impairment amount is calculated as the difference between the
carrying value at amortized cost and the present value of the estimated impaired cash
flows.
For example, on January 1, 2016, Empire Construction Ltd. signed a $200,000, four-year,
non-interest-bearing note payable with Second National Bank. The required yield for the
bank was 8%. During 2018, Empire Construction Ltd. experienced some serious financial
difficulties. Based on the information provided by Empire Construction Ltd. management,
the bank estimated that it was probable that it would receive only 75% of the 2018 balance
at maturity. Additionally, the current market rate of interest in 2018 is 7%.
Below are the effective interest schedule and entries for Second National Bank:

Empire Construction Ltd. (debtor) makes no entry since it still legally owes the debt
amount, unless the impairment results in a troubled debt restructuring, which is discussed
next.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
A troubled debt restructuring occurs if a lender grants concessions such as a reduced
interest rate, an extended maturity date, or a reduction in the debts’ face amount. These
can take the form of a settlement of the debt or a modification of the debt’s terms.

1. Settlement of Debt
This occurs when the debt is derecognized and all amounts relating to the debt, and
any unamortized discounts or premiums, are removed from the debtor’s accounts. A
gain by the debtor is usually recorded, since the creditor grants a concession when
there is a troubled debt restructuring. The creditor will also remove the debt from
the accounts and will record a loss.
The debtor will settle the account by transferring assets such as property, plant,
or equipment that may have been used to secure the note (a loan foreclosure), by
issuing shares, or using the cash proceeds received for a new debt obtained from a
new creditor.
To illustrate, continuing with the example of Empire Construction Ltd.’s note with
Second National Bank, assume that by January 1, 2019, financial troubles have
continued to plague Empire Construction Ltd. to the point where it could no longer
pay the loan when it matured the following year. On January 1, 2019, Second
National Bank agrees to accept a building with a fair value of $160,000 from Empire
Construction Ltd. in full settlement of the note. The building had an original cost of
$185,000 and accumulated depreciation of $5,000. The bank’s (creditor) entry for
the settlement is recorded below:

The fair value of the building is the valuation used to record the asset. The note
receivable and related doubtful account is derecognized, or removed, from the accounts, and a further gain of $40,925 is recorded. If the bank had not previously
used an allowance account, the loss on impairment would be $20,288 ($61,213 −
40,925). At this point, the bank has fully recovered the loan and made a net profit of
$12,994: $11,760 + 12,701 + 8,821 = $33,282 interest − $61,213 impairment loss +
$40,925 impairment gain. If the note had originally been secured by the building,
the bank could have applied to the courts to legally seize ownership of the building
to satisfy the loan obligation.

2. Modification of Terms
If the creditor grants concessions such as a reduced interest rate, an extended
maturity date, a reduction in the debt’s face amount, or accrued interest, there is
a 10% threshold that is used to determine if the concession is minor or substantial.
3. Modification of Terms Less Than 10%
If the present value of the new terms, using the historic interest rate for consistency
and comparability, is less than 10% different from the present value of the remaining
cash flows of the old debt, then it is considered a modification of terms. The old debt
amount remains but is restated using the new terms. In addition, a new effective
interest rate is determined as the rate that equates the old debt with the revised
cash flows resulting from the concessions made, such as the changed interest rate,
due date, and face value. No gain from restructuring of the debt is recorded by the
debtor.
For example, on January 1, 2016, Lehry Ltd. owed $50,000, with interest payments
to be made annually to Freeman Financial Trust. However, it ran into financial
difficulties before any payments were made. On January 1, 2016, Freeman Financial
Trust agrees to make the following concessions:
• Reduce the interest rate from 5% to 4%, with annual payments remaining at
$2,500.
• Extend the due date from January 1, 2016, to January 1, 2019.
• Reduce the face value from $50,000 to $45,000.
Applying the 10% threshold to the present value calculations:
Carrying value of old debt, due January 1, 2016 (present value)
$50,000
The present value, using the historic rate of 5% for the new terms:
PV = (2,500 PMT, 5%, 3 N, 45,000 FV) =
$45,681
Concession amount
$ 4,319
The present value of $45,681 has a concession amount of $4,319, which is less
than the 10% of the present value of the old debt of $50,000 that is now due. As a
result, the concession is treated as a modification of terms. The old debt remains as
the carrying value of the note but with a new effective interest rate and reduced face
value of $45,000 at maturity. The new effective interest rate is calculated the same
way as was done for a non-interest-bearing note where the present value, payment
amount, number of years, and future value are known:

Freeman Financial Trust would account for the restructuring of the note as an impairment loss of $4,319 concession amount calculated above, which was discussed
in the previous section of this chapter.
4. Modification of Terms Greater Than 10%
Modifications to a debt would be considered substantial if either of the following
conditions is present:
• The present value of the new terms (using the historic interest rate) is more
than 10% different than the present value of the remaining cash flows of the old
debt.
• There is a change in creditor and the original debt is legally discharged (CPA
Canada, 2016, Part II, Section 3856.A52 and IFRS 9/B3.3.6).
If either condition exists, the modification is substantial and will be considered a
settlement of the old debt, and a new debt with the new terms is assumed.

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

Going back to the Lehry Ltd. example, on January 1, 2016, Lehry Ltd. owed $50,000
to Freeman Financial Trust but has run into financial difficulties. On January 1, 2016,
Freeman Financial Trust agrees to make the following concessions:
• Reduce the interest rate from 5% to 3%. Payments are to remain at $2,500.
• Extend the due date from January 1, 2016, to January 1, 2018.
• Reduce the face value from $50,000 to $40,000.
Applying the 10% threshold to the present value calculations:
Carrying value of old debt, due January 1, 2016 (present value)
$50,000
The present value, using the historic rate of 5% for the new terms:
PV = (2,500 PMT, 5%, 2 N, 40,000 FV) =
$40,930
Concession amount
$ 9,070
The present value of $40,930 has a concession amount of $9,070, which is more
than the 10% of the present value of the old debt of $50,000, which is now due. As
a result, the concession is treated as a substantial modification of terms. The old
debt is settled, a gain is recorded by the debtor, and a new debt with the new terms
is recorded as shown in the following entry:

The present value of the new debt is calculated as follows:

Freeman Financial Trust would account for the restructuring of the note as an impairment, a term previously discussed in this chapter, except that no allowance account
would be used since this modification is a settlement and not simply an adjustment.
If there was an outstanding allowance account balance from a previous impairment
loss for this debt, the allowance account would also be closed as part of this entry.

13.3 Bonds Payable
When the amount to be borrowed is significant, bonds can provide a source of cash
that is compiled from many investors. The process to issue bonds is initiated by a bond

13.3. Bonds Payable

indenture that contains details such as the denomination or face value of the bonds, the
annual interest rate and payment dates (usually twice per year), and the face amount
payable at maturity. Each bond is issued as a certificate with a specific denomination or
face value, and bonds are usually issued in multiples of $100 or $1,000.
Many bond issuances are sold to an underwriter or broker who acts as the seller in the
marketplace. Brokers can buy the entire issue and resell, thereby assuming all the risks in
the marketplace, or they can sell on behalf of the issuing company on a commission basis.
Each bond issuance has a credit rating assigned to it by independent rating agencies such
as Standard & Poor’s Corporation. The ratings indicate the degree of riskiness assigned
to the issue. Essentially, the higher the rating (AAA or investment-grade bonds), the more
access the company has to investors’ capital at a reasonable interest rate. Conversely,
the lower the rating (CCC/C or junk bonds), the higher the risk and interest rate to be paid.
Since the rating assigned is a function of company performance, this rating can change
over the lifespan of the bond issue. Companies will take great care to preserve their high
ratings.
Types of Bonds
There are many types of bonds with different features for sale in the marketplace. Some
of the more common ones are listed below:

1. Registered bonds: Each bond is registered in the investor’s name. If the bond is
sold, the certificate is cancelled and a new one is issued.
2. Coupon or bearer bonds: The bond is not registered in the investor’s name, so
whoever holds the bond will receive the interest and face value at maturity.
3. Term or serial bonds: Bonds that mature on a single date are term bonds, while
those that mature in instalments are serial bonds.
4. Secured and unsecured bonds: Secured bonds have security or collateral that
was assigned to the issue. For example, mortgage bonds are secured by claims
against real estate. If the issuer defaults on payments, the security can be seized
through a court order and used to satisfy the amounts owed to the bondholders.
Debentures are bonds that are not secured and are often issued by school boards
and municipalities.
5. Callable or convertible bonds: Callable bonds give the issuer the right to call and
retire the bonds before maturity. Convertible bonds allow the holder to convert the
bonds into capital such as the common shares in the company. Convertible debt
gives rise to some interesting accounting challenges in terms of the embedded debt
and equity characteristics for these types of securities. Convertible debt will be
discussed in detail in Chapter 14.

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

13.3.1 Initial and Subsequent Measurement, at Par, at a Discount,
and at a Premium
As with notes payable, bonds are initially recognized at their fair value at the time of
issuance, which is measured at the present value of their future cash flows. They are
subsequently measured at amortized cost. Transaction fees for bonds measured at
amortized cost are to be capitalized, meaning that the costs will reduce the bond payable
amount and be amortized over the life of the bond.
Classification
Bonds are issued as a long-term debt security, which matures in several years, and
are classified as long-term payables on the SFP/BS. When a bond issue’s maturity date
occurs within the next 12 months of the reporting date, or within the business’s operating
cycle if greater than 12 months, it is classified as a short-term bond payable.
You are encouraged to review the section on time value of money, presented earlier in
this chapter, which discussed the present value learning concept.
Bonds Issued at Par
This bond issue is the simplest to account for. If bonds are issued at their face value on
their interest payable date with no transaction fees, the cash proceeds received from the
investors will be the initial measurement amount recorded for the bond issue. The interest
expense is recorded in the same amount as the cash interest paid, at the face or stated
rate, and there is no accrued interest. This means that the effective interest rate (market
rate) and the stated rate (face rate) are the same. At maturity, the amount paid to the
bondholders is the face value (or par value) amount, which is also the fair value on that
date.
To illustrate, on May 1, 2016, Engels Ltd. issued 10-year, 8%, $500,000 par value bonds
with interest payable each year on May 1 and November 1. The market rate at the time of
issuance is 8% and the company year-end is December 31.

Bonds Issued at a Discount
As explained earlier in this chapter regarding notes payable, the market rate (effective rate
or yield) is not always the same as the stated or face rate. When these two interest rates
are different, each one is used to determine certain cash flows required to calculate the
present value. The stated or face rate determines the interest payment amount (PMT),
while the market or effective rate is used to determine the present value of the bond
issuance (I/Y).
To illustrate, on May 1, 2016, Engels Ltd. issued a 10-year, 8%, $500,000 face value bond
with interest payable each year on May 1 and November 1. The market rate at the time of

72

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

issuance is 9% and the company year-end is December 31. In this case the stated rate
of 8% is less than the market rate of 9%. This means that the bond issuance is trading
at a discount and the fair value, or its present value of the future cash flows, will be less
than the face value upon issuance. The present value is calculated as:
20,000
4.5
20
500,000

PMT
I/Y
N
FV

(where semi-annual interest using the stated or face rate is $500,000 × 8% × 6 ÷ 12)
(where 9% market or effective interest is paid twice per year)
(where interest is paid twice per year for 10 years)
(where a single payment of the face value is due in a future year 2026);

Expressed in the following variables string, and using a financial calculator, the present
value is calculated:
Present value (PV) = (20,000 PMT, 4.5 I/Y, 20 N, 500,000 FV) = $467,480

The stated rate of 8% is less than the market rate of 9%, resulting in a present value less
than the face amount of $500,000. This bond issuance is trading at a discount. Since
the market rate is greater, the investor would not be willing to purchase bonds paying
less interest at the face value. The bond issuer must, therefore, sell these at a discount
to entice investors to purchase them. The investor pays the reduced price of $467,480.
For the seller, the discount amount of $32,520 ($500,000 − 467,480) is subsequently
amortized over the life of the bond issuance using one of two possible methods, the same
as was explained for long-term notes payable earlier in this chapter. IFRS companies are
to amortize discounts and premiums using the effective interest rate method, and ASPE
companies can choose between the simpler straight-line method and the effective interest
rate method. The total interest expense for either method will be the same.
Assuming the effective interest rate method is used for the example, the interest schedule
for the bond issuance is shown below:

Year-end accrued interest is

The effective interest rate method ensures that a consistent interest rate is applied throughout the life of the bonds. Straight-line amortization results in varying interest rates throughout the life of the bonds because of the equal amount of the discount applied at each
interest payment date.

Bonds – Straight-Line Method
Companies that follow ASPE can choose to use the simpler straight-line interest method.
The discount of $32,520 ($500,000 −467,480) would be amortized on a straight-line basis
over the 10 years. The interest was paid on a semi-annual basis in the illustration above,
so the amortization of the discount would be $1,626 ($32,520 ÷ 20) on each interest
payment date over the 10-year life of the bonds.

As stated previously, the interest expense will no longer be a constant rate over the life
of the note but the ASPE standard recognizes that privately-held companies will want to
apply a simpler method since ownership is usually limited to a small group of shareholders
and the shares are not publicly traded.
Bonds Issued in Between Interest Payments
If investors purchase bonds on dates falling in between the interest payment dates, the
investor pays an additional interest amount. This is because the bond issuer always pays
the full six months interest to the bondholder on the interest payment date because it
is the easiest way to administer multiple interest payments to potentially thousands of
investors. For example, if an investor purchases bonds four months after the last interest
payment, the issuer will add these additional four months of interest to the purchase price.
When the next interest payment date occurs, the issuer pays the full six months interest
to the purchaser. The interest amount paid and received by the bond-holder will net to
two months. This makes intuitive sense given that the bonds have only been held for two
months making interest for two months the correct amount.
For example, on September 1, 2016, an investor purchases $100,000, 10-year, 8% bonds,
at par, with interest payable each May 1 and November 1. The market price at the time
of issuance was 97. The company year-end is December 31 and it follows ASPE. The
amount paid by the investor on September 1, 2016, would be:
Bond face value at market price (100,000 × 0.97)
Accrued interest (100,000 × 8% × 4 ÷ 12)
Total cash paid

$97,000
2,667
$99,667

When the bond issuer pays the full month’s interest of $4,000 (100,000 × 8% × 6 ÷ 12),
the net interest received by the bondholder will be $1,333 for two months (100,000 ×8% ×
2 ÷ 12). Assuming the straight-line (SL) interest rate method is used for the example, a
partial interest schedule for the bond issuance is shown below:

Bonds Issued at a Premium
If the stated rate is more than the market rate, the bond trades at a premium. This is
because investors are seeking the best interest rate for their investment. If the stated
rate is higher, the bond issuance is more desirable, and the investors would be willing to
pay more for this investment than for another with a lower stated rate. The accounting for
bonds purchased at a premium follows the same method as was illustrated for bonds at a
discount. The illustration will be changed slightly to introduce the use of the market spot
rate.
To illustrate, on May 1, 2016, Impala Ltd. issued a 10-year, 8%, $500,000 face value
bond at a spot rate of 102 (2% above par). Interest is payable each year on May 1 and
November 1. The company year-end is December 31 and follows IFRS.
The spot rate is 102, so the amount to be paid is $510,000 (500,000 ×102) and, therefore,
represents the fair value or present value of the bond issuance on the purchase date.

However, what effective interest rate would be required to result in a present value of
$510,000, a future value of $500,000 payable in 10 years, and a stated or face rate of 8%
interest payable semi-annually? As was explained for the long-term notes payable earlier
in this chapter, since all the other variables are known, and only the interest rate (I/Y) is
unknown, it can be imputed as shown below:

78

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

Effective interest rate (I/Y) = (+/- 510,000 PV, 20,000 PMT, 20 N, 500,000 FV)
= 3.8547% semi-annual interest rate or 7.71% per annum
To prove that the 3.85% is the correct semi-annual effective interest rate, the present value
is calculated as follows:
20,000
3.8547
20
500,000

PMT
I/Y
N
FV

(where semi-annual interest using the stated or face rate is $500,000 × 8% × 6 ÷ 12)
(where market or effective interest is paid twice per year)
(where interest is paid twice a year for 10 years)
(where a single payment of the face value is due in a future year 2026);

Expressed in the following variables string and using a financial calculator, the present
value is calculated as follows:
Present value (PV) = (20,000 PMT, 3.8547 I/Y, 20 N, 500,000 FV) = $510,000 (rounded)

13.3.2 Repayment Before Maturity Date
In some cases, a company may want to repay a bond issue before its maturity. Examples
of such bonds are callable bonds, which give the issuer the right to call and retire the
bonds before maturity. For example, if market interest rates drop, the issuer will want to
take advantage of the lower interest rate. In this case, the re-acquisition price paid to
extinguish and derecognize the bond issuance will likely be slightly higher than the bond
carrying value on that date, and the difference will be recorded by the issuing corporation
as a loss on redemption. The company can, subsequently, sell a new bond issuance at
the new, lower interest rate.
For example, on January 1, 2016, Angen Ltd. issued bonds with a par value of $500,000
at 99, due in 2026. On January 1, 2020, the entire issue was called at 101 and cancelled.
Interest is paid annually, and the discount amortized using the straight-line method. The
carrying value of the bond on January 1, 2020, would be calculated as follows:

80

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

13.4 Fair Value Option, Defeasance, and Off-Balance
Sheet Financing
Notes and Bonds – the Fair Value Option
Long-term debt is usually measured at amortized cost; however, there is an alternative
called the fair-value option that ASPE allows for all types of financial instruments. If
a company chooses to use the fair-value option, the debt instruments are continually
remeasured to their fair value. In the case of IFRS, the fair-value option can be used if it
results in more relevant information.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the higher the credit or solvency risk, the lower the
grade assigned by the independent rating agencies. Furthermore, the grade assigned can
change for better or for worse, depending on the performance of the company over the
life of the debt instrument. In cases where the grade deteriorates because of increasing
credit or solvency risk, the effective interest rate must also increase to compensate for the
higher risk–causing the fair value of the bond instrument to decrease. A decrease in fair
value creates a gain on the credit side of the entry, as shown below:

13.4. Fair Value Option, Defeasance, and Off-Balance Sheet Financing

81

Notes and Bonds – Defeasance and Off-Balance Sheet Financing
Defeasance
If a company wishes to pay off a debt before its maturity date, problems can arise if the
debt agreement stipulates early repayment penalties. One way around this issue is for the
debtor to deposit sufficient funds into a separate trust account that will generate returns
enough to cover the payments owed to the creditor, as outlined in the original agreement.
This is called defeasance, and it can be executed in one of two ways. First, as legal
defeasance, where the creditor agrees to change the debt obligation from the debtor to
the trust. Second, informally as in-substance defeasance, in which case both ASPE and
IFRS do not allow the original debt to be derecognized as the company still legally owes
the debt.
Off-Balance Sheet and Other Sources of Financing
Company performance is in part measured by its liquidity and solvency position. For this
reason, companies are motivated to keep debt off the books. Below are various sources
of financing that do not require recording a debt obligation.
• Operating leases: Companies can avoid reporting a lease obligation if a lease
agreement is written in such a way as to not meet the lease capitalization criteria
required by ASPE and IFRS. The lease payments are subsequently recorded as
rental expenses in exchange for the use of the asset being leased (leases will be
discussed further in a later chapter).
• Selling receivables and investments: Companies can obtain funding by selling
receivables and other investments to special purpose entities (SPE) in exchange for
cash rather than incurring debt. This is known as securitization and is discussed
in more detail in the cash and receivables chapter from the previous intermediate
accounting text.
• Parental control of another company: Companies can obtain access to another
company’s funds through mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, ASPE gives investee companies the choice to report their investments in other companies using
either the equity method or cost, even if control exists. If control in another company
is reported only as a single line item asset called “investment” on the SFP/BS, this
will obscure any potential significant debt that the investee company may have on
their books, which the investor parent company may ultimately be responsible for.
Investments are discussed further in the Intercorporate Investments chapter from
the previous intermediate accounting text.
It is important to note that adequate disclosures of these arrangements are important for
financial statement users.

82

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

13.5 Disclosures of Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt that matures within one year is usually reported as a current liability.
Similarly, any principal portion of long-term debt due within one year of the reporting date
is also to be reported as a current liability. In the absence of a refinancing agreement, any
long-term debt that is refinanced is to be reported as a current liability as well. For ASPE,
to report a long-term debt that is to be refinanced as a long-term debt, the refinancing
agreement must be in place prior to the release of the financial statements. Whereas for
IFRS, it must be in place prior to the reporting date of the financial statements.
Basic debt disclosures usually include:

• maturity date
• interest rate
• amounts due in each of the next five years
• assets pledged as security
• restrictions by creditors (restrictive covenants)
• call provisions
• conversion details
• information regarding liquidity and solvency risks of the company

Note that the reporting disclosures listed above have been simplified, as the disclosures
required by IFRS are, in fact, quite extensive. The disclosures for ASPE are also quite
robust but are slightly less extensive than for IFRS.2

13.6 Long-Term Debt Analysis
The chapter on cash and receivables emphasized the importance of maintaining an adequate cash flow and an efficient inventory-to-cash cycle. When debt is incurred, companies are always mindful that the debt, including interest, must be repaid, thereby drawing
down on cash flows. For this reason, various liquidity and solvency ratios are constantly
monitored by management and investors to ensure company performance is optimal and
access to debt financing continue at reasonable interest rates.
2

CPA Canada (2016) Part II, Section 3856 and IFRS 7 detail the full disclosure requirements.

13.6. Long-Term Debt Analysis

83

Debt is part of a continuum. Too little debt could mean that companies are not taking
advantage of leverage (also known as gearing). Too much debt can cause severe shortages in the cash needed to service the debt (pay the interest and principal amounts owing
in a timely manner) if it is incurred at a greater rate than the inventory-to-cash cycle can
generate cash. Companies in this position can only access additional financial markets
at much higher interest rates and are subject to increasingly restrictive debt covenants
imposed and monitored by the creditor. Important ratios used in the monitoring process
and for restrictive covenants regarding long-term debt include:

• Debt to equity: Measures the company’s share of debt compared to equity.
Total debt ÷ Total equity × 100%
Note: There are also variations of this ratio that only consider long-term debt amounts
for the numerator. This occurs when the creditor is concerned with the long-term
financial structure of the company.
• Debt to total assets: Measures the company’s share of assets that are financed by
debt.
Total debt ÷ Total assets × 100%
• Times interest earned: Measures the company’s ability to cover its interest payments as they come due.
Income before income taxes and interest expense (IBIT+Interest)÷Interest expense

As discussed previously, ratios are difficult to evaluate without something to compare
them to, such as previous company trends or industry standards to use as comparative
benchmarks. In general terms, if debt to total assets is less than 50%, this would be a
reasonable result, meaning that equity has financed greater than 50% of the company’s
total assets. As well, this shows that the company is profitable and is able to cover its
interest expense reasonably.
Companies that are overextended find themselves under increasing pressure to use aggressive accounting policies to stay within the restrictive covenants set by creditors. This
can lead to reporting bias. If discovered by the creditor, they can call the loan for immediate repayment, in which case the loan must subsequently be reclassified as a current
liability, further worsening the current liability ratios such as the current ratio or acid test
ratio. For this reason, it is wise for management to resist the temptation to use such
accounting policies.

Long-Term Financial Liabilities

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe long-term financial liabilities and their role in
accounting and business.
Companies generate cash resources for future business opportunities from three basic
sources: (a) internally from its sales, (b) from investors through issuing shares, (c) from
borrowing from a creditor. Each source has its advantages and disadvantages. If a
company decides to borrow from a creditor, the opportunity to leverage exists. Leveraging
occurs when the interest cost of borrowing debt to purchase assets is lower than the return
generated by the leveraged assets. However, increasing debt also increases liquidity and
solvency risk. Long-term debt is defined as debt with due dates greater than one year. It
can be notes payable, such as mortgages, or bonds payable. Both are financial liabilities
as they both represent obligations fixed by contract.

LO2: Describe notes payable, and explain how they are classified
and how they are initially and subsequently measured and reported.
A note payable is an obligation to pay a specified sum of money in the form of principal
and interest through a formal written promissory note or agreement. Long-term notes
are initially recorded at their fair value, which is calculated as the present value of the
discounted cash flows. Cash flows are characterized by the size and timing of the debt
repayment. Repayment can either be a single lump sum of principal and interest at
maturity, a series of interest payments with a lump sum payment of principal at maturity,
or a series of instalment payments combining both interest and principal over a specified
period. The variables used to determine the present value of the note are the repayment
cash flows, along with the market rate for a note of similar risk, and the timing of the
cash flows. The present value of the note is the amount initially recorded as the note
payable amount. The term zero-interest-bearing notes, or non-interest-bearing notes, is a
misnomer because they do, in fact, include an interest component: the difference between
the borrowed and the repaid amounts.
After issuance, long-term notes payable are subsequently measured at amortized cost.
For example, if the note payable is issued at face value, the present value will be the same
as the face value and there will be no premium or discount to amortize. If the stated rate is
lower or higher than the market rate, the present value will be lower or higher and the note
will be issued at a discount or at a premium, whichever the case. For IFRS companies, the
discount or premium is to be amortized over the life of the note using the effective interest
method. For ASPE companies, the choice is between the effective interest method and
the straight-line method. For non-interest-bearing notes, the interest rate will usually be

Chapter Summary

87

the rate that results in the correct interest component amount. The fair value for notes
payable in exchange for property, goods, or services is usually determined by the fair
value of the good or service given up; however, there can be some issues regarding what
constitutes fair value for exchange transactions.
Other issues relating to subsequent measurement of notes payable are accounting for
impairment and troubled debt restructurings. If a note subsequently becomes impaired,
the creditor will estimate the present value of the impaired cash flow and will write down
the note receivable accordingly. The debtor makes no such entry as there is still a legal
obligation to fully repay the note. For troubled debt restructurings, there are several
calculations and entries for the creditor and the debtor depending on whether there is
a settlement of the debt, a modification of terms less than 10%, or a modification of terms
for greater than 10%.

LO 3: Describe bonds payable, and explain how they are classified
and how they are initially and subsequently measured and reported.
Bond issuance is typically the choice made by companies when the amount of funds
needed is significant. Instead of having a single creditor, many bondholders purchase the
bonds for investment purposes. A broker or underwriter plays a key role in this process.
There are many types of bonds, each with different features that are identified in the bond
indenture.
Like long-term notes payable, bonds are classified as long-term debt until they are within
one year of their maturity, at which time they are classified as a current liability. They are
initially recognized at their fair value, measured by the present value of their future cash
flows, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Bonds can be issued at par or
at either a discount or a premium. The discount or premium is amortized over the life of
the bond using the effective interest method. For ASPE companies, straight-line method
is also acceptable.
Bond issuers always pay interest according to the bond indenture, which often means
payment every six months. For bonds purchased between interest dates, the bondholder
will pay an additional sum on the purchase date, which covers the interest since the last
interest payment date. When the first six-month interest payment is received, the net
amount of the additional monies initially paid out at purchase for accrued interest, and the
first interest income received in case, will represent the correct interest income from the
date of purchase to the first interest payment received.
If interest rates should drop significantly while a bond issue is outstanding, the bond issuer
will be motivated to repay the bondholders before the maturity date and subsequently reissue the bonds at the lower rate. The slightly higher acquisition price paid to reacquire

88

the bonds will be recorded as a loss on redemption.

LO 4: Define and describe other accounting and valuation issues
such as the fair value option, defeasance, and off-balance sheet
financing.
ASPE allows for an alternative measure for notes and bonds called the fair-value option.
IFRS allows this only if it results in more relevant information or as part of a larger fairvalue portfolio. Bond issuers’ credit ratings can drop, which will result in a corresponding
increase in the interest rate. The resulting decrease in the fair value reduces the bond
payable and the offsetting credit is recorded as an unrealized gain. Since these gains
are currently reported in the income statement, it seems counter-intuitive for companies
whose credit ratings have dropped to report an increase in net income. IFRS 9 has
corrected this anomaly since its implementation in 2018.
Companies can be motivated to keep their reported debt at the lowest level legally possible. There are a couple of ways that this can be achieved. First, defeasance involves
the debtor paying monies into a separate trust account ahead of time, and the creditor
receiving payments directly from that trust. In this way, if done legally, the long-term
debt can be removed from the debtor’s books. Second, off-balance sheet sources of
financing are another way to avoid reporting debt on the balance sheet. An example is
operating leases, where the monies paid for the lease are recorded as a rental expense
and, therefore, no lease obligation or asset is reported. This will be discussed in further
detail in a later chapter about leasing.

LO 5: Explain how long-term debt is disclosed in the financial
statements.
There are specific and extensive reporting requirements for long-term debt, including the
impact on reporting regarding refinancing agreements. Basic reporting requirements include disclosures of the interest rate, maturity date, security details, restrictive covenants
required by creditors, and current portion of long-term debt, to name a few. Since IFRS
companies are usually publicly traded, impacting many investors, the reporting requirements are extensive.

LO 6: Identify the different methods used to analyze long-term
liabilities; calculate and interpret three specific ratios used to
analyze long-term liabilities.
Notes and bonds payable affect the liquidity and solvency of companies since the debt
must be repaid at some point. Companies’ cash positions must continually be monitored
to ensure that there are enough cash reserves to repay maturing debt. Three common
ratios that can trigger a further review, if unfavourable, are debt to equity, debt to total assets, and times interest earned. Comparable benchmarks make ratios a useful monitoring
tool.

LO 7: Explain the similarities and differences between ASPE and
IFRS regarding recognition, measurement, and reporting of
long-term payables.
In this case, IFRS and ASPE are quite similar. A difference between them is the choice of
amortization method used for bonds and notes that were issued at a discount or premium.
ASPE has the added option to amortize the premium or discount using either the straightline method or the effective method. Additionally, ASPE disclosures are less than those
required by IFRS.

Chapter 14
Complex Financial Instruments

Is Convertible Debt a Viable Financing Option?
Convertible debt is an instrument that can be converted from debt (liability) to equity
shares at some point, often due to a triggering event. Creditors can become
shareholders by purchasing the equity share offered in the terms of the convertible
agreement. Creditors can often purchase these shares at a discount, and this can be
a strong motivator for converting the debt to equity.
There are advantages and disadvantages for a company obtaining its financing
through convertible debt.
Advantages
Convertible debt can be simpler, cheaper, and faster, since the debt documentation is
much shorter and simpler, with fewer terms to negotiate. As a result, legal fees will
also likely be less compared to the fees incurred for a small preferred shares offering.
The process can be completed within a matter of two weeks compared to several
months for other forms of equity financing.
Convertible debt does not require setting a valuation of the company, as is required
for other forms of equity financing in order to set the share price in the offering. In the
absence of operational history, it is difficult for most new companies to set a valuation.
Moreover, company valuations can create a temptation to over-value the company to
maximize the share price at that time. Any subsequent issuance of shares would be
priced at the lower market price causing discontent for the original shareholders who
paid more for the shares due to the initial over-valuation.
Funds received from convertible debt allow companies to keep control, especially if
the conversion is from debt to preferred shares with no voting rights. The company
control by existing shareholders will become diluted through the alternative of common
share offerings to obtain financing.
Disadvantages
Common shares issuances are commonplace and well understood by investors.
Convertible debt, on the other hand, is a hybrid instrument with debt and equity
features that can be confusing to investors, thus making the instrument harder to
sell.
99

100

Complex Financial Instruments

Prior to conversion, convertible debt interest must be paid, and the principal amount
owed must be reported as a liability, even though it may not be payable until a
subsequent triggering event occurs. Since convertible debt is considered debt until
conversion, its presence in the balance sheet will negatively impact the liquidity ratios,
solvency ratios, and any restrictive covenants currently in force from other creditors.
Assuming that the convertible debt converts to preferred shares, some investors may
not like the lack of control compared to investing in common shares. To compensate,
companies will often add other attractive features to preferred shares, but investors
may still prefer to invest elsewhere rather than give up the rights inherent in common
shares.
Other Financial Products
Companies can raise capital by means other than convertible debt. A simple loan
is one alternative, but this is often difficult for new companies with higher credit risk
to obtain. Preferred shares are an alternative with dividends and preferred rights
such as voting rights, but this may cause issues for existing common shareholders.
Convertible preferred shares are also an option. These are like convertible debt
except the loan features such as interest are excluded.

Complex Financial Instruments

14.1 Complex Financial Instruments: Overview
As stated in the previous chapter regarding long-term debt, most businesses will require financing at various points throughout their lives. For example, new businesses
may require start-up cash to purchase revenue-generating assets, as they have yet to
accumulate cash holdings. Existing companies may want to expand their operations or
replenish depleted cash holdings due to a temporary downturn in sales. There are also
companies that possess large infrastructures, such as airlines or railways, and require
more cash for their capital projects than can be generated from normal operations. These
businesses obtain the necessary additional cash through various financing activities such
as internally generated free cash flow, borrowing from creditors (debt), and issuing capital
shares (equity).
The material presented in the previous chapters looked at debt and equity as separate
instruments. However, in recent decades financing activities have created hybrid sources
of financing where a single instrument can possess characteristics of both debt and equity.
Examples of these more complex instruments are convertible debt, convertible preferred
shares, and various derivatives such as options and warrants that can be converted into
common shares.
Why do companies seek out these alternative financing sources? As the opening story
explains, instruments such as convertible debt can often be simpler, cheaper, and faster to
obtain – all while maintaining existing control, or at least knowing exactly when the control
will change due to the triggering event. Also, these hybrid securities usually include
sweeteners, such as conversion to shares at a lower than market price, thereby increasing
their attractiveness to investors. Moreover, investors will be more willing to purchase the
bonds because they not only provide greater security if secured by company assets, but
they also allow investors to participate in the company profits and growth through the
option to convert to common shares. Since the conversion feature adds flexibility, and
hence increased value, companies can usually obtain convertible debt at cheaper interest
rates. However, there is more to the story. Convertible instruments have a significantly
different effect on perceptions held by shareholders and the marketplace. For example,
if a company issues additional common shares to raise capital, instead of using its own
internally generated funds from profits or by borrowing funds (to be repaid by internally
generated funds), the market can interpret this negatively, as a sign that the company is
unable to obtain debt financing, perhaps due to a poor credit rating. In other words, it
sends a signal that the company might not be performing as well as it should. This can
lower the market value of the shares, thereby creating a negative climate and causing
concern for the shareholders.
If convertible bonds (debt) or convertible preferred shares or warrants (equity) are issued
instead, the investment holders will only convert to common shares if conditions are
favourable. This sends a positive signal to the market that the company is continuing

14.2. Long-Term Debt and Equity Instruments: A Review

103

to do well. As a result, these hybrid instruments become a way to access funding while
maintaining a more positive climate, without unduly alarming shareholders and creditors.
As such, these hybrid instruments have become widely accepted and commonplace in
today’s market.
From an accounting standards point of view, the issue becomes: how do you separate,
measure, and report the debt and equity attributes of these complex financial instruments
throughout their life-cycle of issuance, subsequent measurement, and conversion or retirement?

14.2 Long-Term Debt and Equity Instruments: A Review
Since convertible instruments each possess a combination of debt and equity characteristics, the challenge becomes: how to separate, measure, and report the debt and equity
attribute for each type of instrument required by the accounting standards.
For complex financial instruments, once an acceptable method to separate the debt from
the equity component is determined, each component will follow its respective accounting
standard, as discussed in previous chapters.
It is important to understand the substance of debt and equity instruments so that the
classification and amounts reported reflect their true underlying economic substance,
rather than simply their legal form. Therefore, a review of debt and equity instruments
and their characteristics is presented below:
Examples
Maturity

Secured by and seniority

Long-Term Liabilities (Debt)
Bonds and long-term notes
payable
Principal and accrued
interest due on various
dates identified in the
documentation.
Usually secured by various
company assets. Debt
ranks in seniority to shares
in terms of windup,
bankruptcy, and
liquidation.

Equity (Shares)
Preferred and common
shares
Permanent capital unless
repurchased by the
company.
Unsecured. Shareholders
are entitled to whatever
assets remain after
creditors are paid out.
Preferred shares are also
senior to common shares.

104

Complex Financial Instruments

Advantages and
disadvantages

• Interest expense lowers
net income and is also
tax deductible.

• Dividend payouts have
no effect on net income
or income taxes.

• Principal and accrued
interest must be repaid
on the maturity date
unless debt is
convertible to shares.

• Dividends payouts are
optional, and shares are
permanent capital held
by shareholders unless
repurchased by the
company.

• Unpaid principal and
interest increase liquidity
and solvency risk and
could lead to reduced
access to other capital.
• Company does not give
up control of company
policies.
• Can use the funds from
debt financing to
generate profits with
higher returns compared
to the interest accrued
on the debt itself
(leveraging).

• Shares balances have
no direct effect on
liquidity and solvency
ratios, but other ratios
such as earnings per
share are affected.
• Company gives up
proportionate share of
control for each voting
share issued, and
existing shareholders’
investment holdings
become diluted. Market
share can also decline in
value if a shares
issuance is significant.
• Shareholder capital
represents company
ownership so there is no
leveraging opportunity.

The schedule below is a summary of the accounting treatment for long-term liabilities
(debt) taken from an earlier chapter:

14.3. Complex Financial Instruments

Financial Liabilities

Disclosure

ASPE
Fair value as the present
value of future cash flows.
Amortized cost unless the
fair-value option is chosen.
Can choose to use either
the effective interest rate
or straight-line methods to
amortize discounts and
premiums.
Any principal portion of
long-term debt due within
one year of the reporting
date is to be reported
under current liabilities as
the current portion of
long-term debt. Long-term
debt that is refinanced may
be classified as long-term
provided the refinancing is
in place by the time the
financial reports are
issued.

105

IFRS
Fair value as the present
value of future cash flows.
Amortized cost unless the
fair-value option is chosen
because it results in more
relevant information. The
effective interest rate
method is the only method
allowed to amortize
discounts and premiums.
Any principal portion of
long-term debt due within
one year of the reporting
date is to be reported
under current liabilities as
the current portion of
long-term debt. Long-term
debt that is refinanced may
be classified as long-term
provided the refinancing is
in place by the reporting
date.

In an earlier chapter we discussed equity—including preferred and common shares. To
recap in basic terms, equity shares issuance is accounted for using historical cost, net
of any direct costs of the shares issuance such as underwriting costs, accounting and
legal fees, and printing costs. Additionally, disclosure includes the number of shares
authorized and issued for common and preferred shares. For preferred shares, the per
share dividend amount is also disclosed.

14.3 Complex Financial Instruments
Complex financial instruments possess more than one financial component, such as a
combination of debt or equity attributes as explained in the introduction. Examples of complex financial instruments are: convertible bonds payable, convertible preferred shares,
and options/warrants that attach to shares or bonds. Convertible bonds are usually issued
in exchange for cash, which must either be repaid later at maturity (debt attribute) or,
alternatively, must be converted into a specific number of common shares at specific
points in time (equity attribute). Convertible preferred shares possess both the attributes

106

Complex Financial Instruments

of preferred shares and common shares if they are converted into a specific number of
common shares at specific times. Clearly, these convertible instruments possess more
than one debt or equity attribute compared to non-convertible financial instruments.
Convertible debt and convertible preferred shares will be discussed next, and derivative
instruments, such as options and warrants, will be discussed briefly towards the end of
the chapter.

14.3.1 Convertible Debt and Preferred Shares Classification: Two
Methods
The accounting standards require that bonds that are convertible into common shares
are to be separated into the value of the bond, without the conversion feature (debt
component), and an embedded/attached option to convert the debt into common shares
(equity component). Convertible preferred shares are separated into the value of the
preferred share, without the conversion feature (shares equity component), and an option
to convert preferred shares into common shares (contributed surplus equity component).
There are a number of methods that can accomplish the separation of debt from equity
components, but IFRS recommends only the residual method, while ASPE allows either
the residual method or the zero-equity method.

• The residual method estimates and allocates the fair value of the bond first, without
the conversion feature, because debt is usually the more reliably measurable component as compared to equity. As previously discussed in the chapter on long-term
debt, the bond valuation basis is the present value of the future cash flows using
the market rate of interest for debt instruments with similar attributes and risk. Any
residual amount remaining is assigned to the equity component.
• The zero-equity method assigns the full valuation of the transaction to the debt
component and a zero-value to the equity component.

Bonds Issued at Par – Residual Method
As an example, on January 1, Willowby Ltd. issues $250,000, three-year, 8% convertible
bonds at par value for $256,328 cash. Interest is payable annually on December 31.
Each $1,000 bond may be converted into 80 common shares, which are currently trading
at $12. Bonds without the conversion feature trade in the market at par.

At each reporting date, each component would be reported according to their respective
standard. For example, bonds would be reported at their amortized cost as a liability and
the options at historical cost as contributed surplus in equity. In this case, the bonds were
issued at par so there is no premium or discount to amortize, and the bonds payable
balance would remain at $250,000 until conversion or maturity.
If the market price of the shares increased to $16, bondholders would be motivated to
convert the bonds to shares, even before maturity in three years. This is because each
$1,000 would now be worth $1,280 (80 shares × $16). The entry to convert would be:

Note that the carrying values (book values) at the time of conversion were the values used
in the conversion entry, hence its name: the book value method. This method is required
for both IFRS and ASPE when recording bond conversions, and it results in no gain or
loss recognized or recorded upon conversion. Any accrued interest that was forfeited at
the time of conversion would also be credited to common shares.
Conversely, if the share price did not increase, and the bonds reach maturity without conversion, the amount owing for the bond is payable to the bondholder and the contributed
surplus (in some counties referred to as reserves) amount in equity will lapse. The entry
for fully amortized bonds at maturity would be:

Bonds Issued at a Premium or Discount – Residual Method
On January 1, Jason Inc. issues $300,000, five-year, 7% convertible bonds at 98. Interest
is payable annually on December 31. Each $1,000 bond may be converted into 100
common shares, which are currently trading at $9. Bonds without the conversion feature
trade in the market at 8%.
Using the residual method, the present value of the bonds at the market-based discounted
amount, with the conversion feature, is $294,000. This is compared to the present value of
the bonds, without the conversion feature, at the market rate of 8% (debt component). The
difference between the two present values is allocated to the option (equity component).

As in the previous example, bonds would be reported as a long-term liability at their
amortized cost and the contributed surplus for the options at historical cost in equity. In
this case, the bonds were issued at 98, so the discount amount of $11,978 ($300,000 −
$288,022) would be amortized over the five years using the effective method at 8%*
for IFRS and ASPE (or the optional straight-line method for ASPE) until conversion or
maturity.

PV = (PMT, I/Y, N, FV)

Bonds Retired Prior to Maturity with Incentives
Sometimes a company will want to retire a bonds issue before maturity to reduce interest
expenses. To facilitate this, any convertible bonds that are repaid prior to maturity will
usually include a sweetener, which is added to the repayment proceeds to motivate
the bondholders to sell. In this case, both the amounts paid to the bondholders and
the sweetener must be allocated between the debt and equity components. Unlike the
previous examples with no sweeteners, the additional funds added to the payout as a
sweetener will result in a loss reported in net income.
For example, on January 1, 2015, Essessive Corp. offers 5-year, 6% convertible bonds
with a par value of $1,000. Interest is paid annually on December 31. Each $1,000 bond
may be converted into 150 common shares, which are currently trading at $3 per share.
Similar bonds without the conversion feature carry an interest rate of 7%. Essessive
issues 1,500 bonds at par and allocates the proceeds under the residual method. The
entry to record the bond issuance using the residual method would be recorded the same
way as par value bonds discussed earlier:

PMT = $1,500,000 × 6% = $90,000 interest payable each December 31

On January 1, 2017, immediately following the interest payment, Essessive Corp. decides
to retire the convertible bonds early to reduce interest costs. They offer the bondholders
$1,600,000 cash, the fair value of the convertible bonds at the time of early retirement,
plus a sweetener. The fair value of the debt portion of the payout for the convertible bond is
$1,485,000. Because a sweetener is included, the $1,600,000 payout to the bondholders
will result in a loss for the company, as shown in the entry below:

= ($61,503 − ($1,600,000 − $1,485,000)) = $53,497

The $24,365 loss is the difference between the carrying value of the bond at the time
of early retirement ($1,460,635) and the fair value of the debt component of $1,485,000.
The reduction in equity of $53,497 is due to the difference between the carrying value
of the contributed surplus, convertible bond options of $61,503, and the fair value of the
equity component of $115,000 ($1,600,000 − $1,485,000 debt component).

additional cash sweetener of $30,000, instead of a repayment of the debt in cash, the

** Loss = carrying value of bonds − FV of debt component
= ($1,460,635 − $1,485,000)
= $24,365 loss
*** Reduction in retained earnings (equity) = additional cash of $30,000 −
loss on redemption of bonds of $24,365

Under IFRS, the entire cash incentive of $15,000 is recorded as a debit to the loss
account, eliminating the retained earnings account.
In summary, an early payout, or conversion of convertible bonds, usually requires a
sweetener to motivate bondholders to accept the deal. This additional cash amount must
be allocated between a loss, due to debt component of $24,365, and a reduction in equity,
due to a capital transaction cost of $5,635, associated with the convertible capital options
retired. The sum of the loss and the reduction to retained earnings should balance with
the cash sweetener amount of $30,000. Other than the addition of the loss ($24,365) and
the reduction in retained earnings ($5,635), the accounting treatment for early retirement
is basically the same as before (using book values). In other words, the carrying values
of the debt ($1,460,635) and equity ($61,503) components are still used to determine the
common shares amount ($1,522,138), as was the case in the earlier examples.

14.3.2 Presentation of Convertible Debt and Preferred Shares
At each reporting date, the debt and equity components for convertible instruments would
be reported according to their respective standard. Bonds would, therefore, classify the
debt component as a long-term liability at amortized cost and the options as contributed
surplus in equity at historical cost:
Essessive Corp.

Bonds payable, 6% annually, due January 1, 2020

$1,438,497

Shareholders’ Equity
Paid-in capital:
Contributed surplus, conversion rights

$

61,503

For convertible preferred shares, reporting as either a liability or equity would depend
on the characteristics of the convertible preferred shares. The general rule is that if the
company has little control over an obligation to issue common shares in exchange for the

114

Complex Financial Instruments

preferred shares, or if they must pay inordinately high dividends upon some threshold
being met, the company must report these preferred shares as a liability because they
represent an unavoidable obligation. Moreover, the dividends paid for preferred shares,
classified as liabilities, would be reported in net income as an interest expense instead of
a reduction to retained earnings, as is the case for preferred shares dividends without
liability attributes. An example of convertible preferred shares classified as a liability
would be mandatorily redeemable preferred shares, such as preferred shares that must be
repurchased if common shares exceed some sort of threshold market price. In this case,
the company clearly has an obligation over which it has little control. This classification
as a liability is a requirement for IFRS companies in all instances. For ASPE companies,
the liability classification is used when the likelihood of the obligation arising is high.

14.4 Options, Warrants, Forwards, and Futures
Options, warrants, forwards, and futures are all examples of derivatives. Derivatives are
financial instruments whose value is derived from some underlying instrument, object,
index, or event (an “underlying”). Put another way, a derivative represents a contract
arising between two or more parties based upon the underlying. Its value is determined
by fluctuations in the underlying, and as they have their own value, they can be bought
and sold. Reasons for buying or selling may be to minimize risk (hedging) or to make a
profit (speculation).
A hedge is an investment, such as a futures contract, whose value moves in an offsetting
manner to the underlying asset. Hedging is comparable to taking out an insurance policy,
for example, when homeowners in a fire-prone area takes out insurance policies to protect
themselves from loss in the event of fire. There is a risk/reward trade-off inherent in
hedging as it both reduces potential risk and carries an associated cost, such as the fire
insurance policy premiums. That said, most homeowners choose to take that predictable
loss by paying insurance premiums rather than risk the loss.
Managing foreign exchange rates provides another example of hedging. Fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates can be either advantageous or detrimental to businesses depending on whether the exchange rate increases or decreases, and if the business is
exporting or importing goods or services. For example, companies buying goods from
another country on credit when the domestic currency exchange rate is rising, or selling
goods to another country on credit when the foreign country’s currency is rising, can
reap significant gains. However, the opposite can also occur if the rates are decreasing,
causing company profits to plummet. Companies can lower these risks by entering into a
derivative contract to buy foreign currency at a future date at a specified exchange rate,
thereby locking in the purchase price to a known quantity of foreign currency. In this way,
a company can manage the risks associated with changes in the foreign exchange rates
through hedging.

14.4. Options, Warrants, Forwards, and Futures

115

Speculation regarding derivatives is an effort to make a profit from an unknown outcome.
Continuing with the example of foreign currency, if the change in foreign exchange rates
favours the speculator, a profit can be made.
Options, warrants, forwards, and futures are all types of derivatives and each one is
summarized below. An in-depth discussion of derivatives is covered in a more advanced
accounting course.

Options
Call options give the options holder the right to buy an underlying instrument, such as
common shares, at a specified price within a specified time frame. The options price is
called the exercise, or strike, price and the option must be in the money. That is, the
market price must be greater than the exercise price so that the options holder will benefit
from exercising the options held. Call options are the most common type of option and
employee stock options are a good example. Stock options will be discussed in the next
section of this chapter and in the Chapter 19.
Put options are the opposite of call options, because they give the options holder the
right to sell common shares at a specified price within a specified time frame back to the
issuing company. If the market price of the shares should decline, the option holder can
still sell their shares back to the issuing company at the higher specified price.
A written option is when a company sells options in exchange for giving the option holder
the right to purchase the underlying shares at a future date. A written option represents an
obligation to the company to issue the shares, if called by the option holder or redeem the
shares if put by the option holder. For this reason, it is a liability to the company because
of the obligation created. Conversely, a purchase option is when a company pays to
purchase options giving the company the right to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying
shares from another company, at a future date, if they choose. There is a choice, so no
obligation exists to the company holding the call or put options and therefore no liability to
record.
Options have their own value which can increase or decrease in response to the changes
in market value of the underlying instruments, such as shares. If the market value of
shares increase, the options fair value will also increase. Options are to be remeasured
to their fair value through net income at each reporting date. If the options are sold in the
marketplace without exercising them for shares, any gain or loss upon sale is recorded to
net income, and the options derivatives are removed from the books.

* Reported as either a financial asset or liability depending on if the account has a debit or credit balance.

If the options are exercised, the investment in shares is recorded as a debit, in addition to
the entry shown above.

Warrants
Warrants are similar to call options except that they are only issued by the company itself
and usually have longer time frames than options. Unlike options, warrants are usually
attached to another financial instrument, such as bonds and shares.

Forward Contracts
With forward contracts, both contract parties make a commitment in advance to buy or
sell something to each other at a mutually agreed-upon price at a future date. A common
example is the purchase or sale of goods in foreign currencies between a supplier and a
manufacturer.
Note that once the terms have been agreed upon, and the maturity date occurs, there
is no option out of a forward contract. Also, for the contract to be acceptable to both
parties, the two parties must hold opposite views as to what will happen to the underlying
instrument, for example whether a currency exchange rate will increase or decrease. A
forward contract can be privately negotiated and, if the two parties agree to the terms,
price, and future date, a forward contract is considered to exist between them.
As an example, on November 15, Monnard Inc. agrees to buy $100,000 USD from Oncore
Ltd. over the next 90-day period for $108,000 CAD. As nothing is exchanged upon the

14.4. Options, Warrants, Forwards, and Futures

117

contract issuance, no accounting entry is required. However, on December 31, the
company year-end, the exchange rate has changed, and $100,000 USD is now worth only
$102,000 CAD. Despite this, Monnard Inc. is still committed to pay the agreed-upon price
of $108,000 CAD and, therefore, a loss has occurred. The derivative must be remeasured
to fair value at the reporting date and Monnard Inc. must record a loss as follows:

Futures Contracts
These contracts are like forwards contracts except that they are highly standardized in
terms of price and maturity date so that they may be publicly traded in the stock market.
Examples include commodities, such as agricultural products (cattle, corn, wheat), and
precious metals (gold, silver). Publicly traded refers to the fact that futures contracts can
be used by speculators, rather than used as a hedge against inflation by actual buyers.
Speculators are looking to make money on a favourable change in the foreign exchange
rate, meaning the actual delivery of the commodity rarely ever occurs.
For example, on November 15, instead of a forwards contract, Monnard Inc. bought a
futures contract for $1,500 that entitles the company to buy $100,000 USD at a cost of
$108,000 CAD on December 15. In this case, $1,500 is paid to obtain the futures contract
from the stock market. The entry would be:

On December 31, company year-end, the exchange rate has changed, and $100,000
USD is worth only $102,000 CAD. This unfavourable drop means that the futures contract
value will also drop. If the futures contract now has a negative value of ($1,000), a loss
has occurred which Monnard Inc. must record as follows:

As can be seen from the two examples above, derivatives are measured at fair value with
the gain or loss reported in net income. There are, however, two exceptions. The first
relates to hedging and is beyond the scope of this textbook. The second is regarding
derivatives that relate to a company’s own shares which are to be recorded at historic
cost and not fair value. An example would be warrants attached to common shares and
employee stock option plans, which will be discussed next.
One theoretically interesting area to look at is purchase commitments, where a company
orders goods from a supplier, followed by receiving the goods in the future. There are
similarities between a purchase commitment and derivatives, such as futures or forwards
contracts. For example, a purchase commitment is drafted and signed in advance and is
connected to underlying goods that have value. The commitment will be settled sometime
in the future. So, why are purchase commitments not recognized as a derivative? The
main reasons are because the intent of a purchase commitment is to obtain the goods
and purchase commitments have no intrinsic value of their own, and therefore cannot
trade in the marketplace. Also, purchase commitments are not settled by any means
other than taking possession of the goods. Conversely, futures contracts can be publicly

14.5. Stock Compensation Plans

119

traded on their own, without ever taking possession of the underlying goods. For these
reasons, purchase commitments are not considered to be derivatives and are recorded
as a purchase of goods, once the risks and rewards of the goods have passed from the
seller to the purchaser.

14.5 Stock Compensation Plans
An employee stock option is commonly viewed as a complex call option on the common
stock of a company, granted by the company to an employee as remuneration or reward.
The belief is that employees holding common shares will be motivated to align themselves
with the company’s best interests. This is beneficial to the company as it allows them to
retain valuable employees long-term in exchange for non-cash forms of compensation or
benefits.
The most common stock option plans are employee stock option plans (ESOPs) and
compensatory stock option plans (CSOPs), but stock appreciation rights plans (SARs)
and other performance criteria based plans are also used in business.

14.5.1 Employee Stock Options Plans
These plans are relatively straightforward. In these plans, the employee is granted the
option to purchase shares of the company. This is, therefore, not considered to be a
compensation expense as the employee is simply given the opportunity to invest in the
company’s equity by purchasing shares. By holding company shares, they share in the
dividends and capital appreciation of the share in the marketplace the same as any other
shareholders.
For example, Besco Ltd. implements an ESOP in which employees can purchase options
to buy company shares for $15 per share. The cost of the option is $2 and 20,000 shares
are available within this plan. No entry is required at this time because no transactions
have occurred yet.
On January 1, employees purchase 12,000 options:

If the market price of the shares later increased to $20 per share, the options will be “in

at a share price that is lower than the current share market price. If 8,000 of the 12,000

14.5.2 Compensatory Stock Options Plans
These plans are compensation based and are usually offered to key executives as part of
their remuneration package. The executive is granted the option to purchase shares of the
company in lieu of compensation, commencing on the exercise date and throughout the
fiscal periods, until the expiry date. By holding company shares, the executives can share
in the benefits of ownership, the same as with ESOPs. The difference is that the options
are part of their compensation package and are not purchased for cash. Meaning that,
as the employment service period is completed, compensation expense is to be allocated
and recorded as an expense accrual.
If options are allowed to expire because the service requirement is not met, such as
when an employee leaves the company, IFRS requires that this be treated prospectively
as a change in estimate. In contrast, ASPE gives companies a choice to either treat
prospectively as a change in estimate, or to record forfeitures as they occur.
On August 1, 2015, Silverlights Ltd. granted stock options to its chief executive officer.
Details are as follows:

shares was $25. Note that the fair value of the options on the grant date has to be
determined using an option pricing model, or some other valuation technique, as there is
no active market for employee stock options. The remaining stock options were allowed
to expire. The company year-end is July 31, follows ASPE, and management chose to
account for the expired options as they occurred.
On the August 1, 2015, grant date, no entry is recorded because the service period has
only just begun and, as such, no economic event has yet taken place.

14.5.3 Stock Appreciation Rights and Performance-Based Plans
Stock Appreciation Rights Plans (SARs)
In this plan, employees’ entitlement to receive cash-paid compensation is based on an
increase in the fair value of a stated number of shares from the pre-existing share price
over the exercise period. Note that no shares are actually issued. The share price
is tracked, and the cash-paid compensation is based on the results of these tracked
changes. This plan eliminates the need for employees to actually exercise the options,
buy the common shares, and later sell the common shares, to realize the monetary gain.
However, the issue is how to best measure the fair value of the shares between the grant
date and exercise date. ASPE and IFRS differ in their approach to this valuation, where
IFRS requires the use of an options pricing model, while ASPE uses a less complex
formula that calculates the difference between the pre-established share price with the
market or fair value price on the exercise date for each share granted to the employee.
For both standards, the total amount is allocated over the service period and recorded as
compensation expense and a corresponding liability.
Performance-Based Plans
Some companies opt to also use other performance criteria, rather than simply the change
in share prices. Other ratios, such as growth in sales, earnings per share, and return on
assets, may be used as the basis for the compensation payment (which is allocated the
same way as SARs, as explained above). Sometimes a performance-based plan will be
offered to employees in combination with an options-based plan, and the employee can
choose.

14.5.4 Disclosures of Compensation Plans
Some of the main disclosures include:

• Description of the compensation plan, including the numbers and dollar values of
the options issued, exercised, forfeited, and expired.
• Description of the assumptions incorporated, and methods used, to determine the
fair values.
• Total compensation expense included in net income and its related contributed
surplus.

The reporting disclosures listed above are a simplified version of the more extensive
disclosures required by the accounting standards. For example, BCE Inc.’s financial statements dedicated a significant number of pages to compensation information contained in
Notes 2, 21, and 26.1 The company also prepared a 61-page compensation discussion
and analysis report to supplement the note disclosures. From this example, disclosures
regarding compensation clearly go far beyond what is normally expected.

14.6 Analysis
Complex financial instruments, including options, would be incorporated into liabilities and
equity respectively. Refer to the other chapters on long-term debt and equity for details

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe complex financial instruments and their role in
accounting and business.
Companies obtain cash resources for future business operations and opportunities for internally generated free cash flow from borrowing from a creditor (debt) and from investors
through issuing shares. Historically, debt and equity sources were separate instruments.
However, in recent decades hybrid (or complex) instruments that include both debt and
equity attributes are now available to businesses. Examples include convertible bonds,
convertible preferred shares, and various derivatives (such as options and warrants) all
of which can be converted into common shares. These instruments are often simpler,
cheaper, and quicker to obtain, and they offer greater flexibility and security to investors
because of the embedded convertible options to common shares. These complex instruments also influence the perceptions of shareholders and the marketplace. As investors
will only convert from the original instrument to common shares if it is favourable to do
so, they send a positive signal to existing shareholders that the company is performing
well. The issue from an accounting perspective is how to separate, classify, and value the
debt and equity attributes during the instrument’s life cycle of issuance, conversion, and
retirement.

LO 2: Describe the basic differences in the accounting treatments
for long-term debt and equity.
For complex financial instruments, once an acceptable method to separate the debt from
the equity is determined, each component will follow its respective accounting standard as

Chapter Summary

125

discussed in previous chapters. As such, it is important to understand the basics of debt
and equity instruments so that the classification and amounts reported reflect their true
underlying economic substance, rather than simply their legal form. For example, equity
is measured and reported at historic cost and represents unsecured permanent capital of
the company. As a return on their investment, shareholders receive a share of the profits
through dividends, which are optional and not subject to income taxes for the company.
Long-term debt consists of principal and interest expense, which must be paid when due
and is secured by company assets. The debt has a negative effect on company liquidity
and solvency ratios, and the interest expense reduces company income taxes. There
are differences between IFRS and ASPE regarding amortization of methods and some
disclosures of long-term debt.

LO 3: Describe the two methods acceptable to IFRS and ASPE to
separate, classify, measure, and disclose complex financial
instruments such as convertible debt and convertible preferred
shares.
IFRS uses only the residual method for the accounting treatment of convertible debt,
such as convertible bonds and preferred shares. This method estimates and allocates
the fair value of the most reliable component first, usually the debt component. The
residual amount remaining is allocated to the equity component. For the debt component,
the valuation is based on the present value of the future cash flows using the prevailing
market interest rate at issuance. In contrast, ASPE uses both the residual method and the
zero-equity method. The zero-equity method assigns the full value to the debt component
and a zero value to the equity component.
These methods are applied at the time of issuance for convertible debt, such as bonds
that are issued at par or at a premium or discount. Bonds are subsequently measured at
amortized cost. Bonds that are converted to common shares use the book value method
to determine the valuations. The book value method uses the carrying values of the
debt and contributed surplus at the time of conversion to determine the common shares
amount (IFRS and ASPE). Since carrying values are the basis for the conversion, no
gains or losses are recorded.
Convertible debt can also be retired prior to maturity, usually with an incentive, also
known as a sweetener. This is used to motivate the bondholders to sell the debt back
to the company or to convert their bonds into common shares. Both the amounts paid
to the bondholders and the sweetener must be allocated between the debt and equity
components. Because of the additional proceeds added as an incentive, gains or losses
will occur. The sum of the gain or loss from the redemption of the bonds, and the
proportionate share of the contributed surplus, must be equal to the additional proceeds
paid as a sweetener. Disclosures of convertible debt, or convertible preferred shares,

126

Complex Financial Instruments

are the same as disclosures of other debt and equity instruments and securities. The
determination of the classification, as either a liability or equity, is based on whether the
company has any control over whether an obligation will arise from these convertible
instruments. In cases where there is little or no control over the obligation, the transactions
are reported as a liability (IFRS) or if the obligation is only highly likely (ASPE).

LO 4: Describe various derivatives such as options, warrants,
forwards, and futures.
Options, warrants, forwards, and futures are all examples of derivatives. They are valued
based on of the fluctuations in some underlying instrument, object, index, or event. If
these derivatives have their own value, they can be bought and sold privately, or through
the marketplace. Businesses will buy or sell to minimize risk (hedging) or to make a
profit (speculation). An example of hedging can be seen in how companies handle the
fluctuations in foreign exchange currency. For example, companies can obtain a derivative
contract that locks in the exchange rate to manage these fluctuations, thereby hedging
their risk. Options are another derivative that gives the options holder the right to purchase
or sell common shares in a company at a specified price. The right to purchase common
shares at a specified price is called a call option, for example employee stock options;
whereas, the right to sell common shares at a specified price is called a put option.
In either case, this will only occur if the specified price is favourable compared to the
market price. Warrants have characteristics like options. Forward and future contracts
are typically used to buy and sell any type of commodity, including currencies. In the
case of a forward contract, once both parties agree on the terms the contract becomes
binding. A futures contract is like a forwards contract except that it is standardized
regarding price and maturity dates, allowing them to be bought and sold in the stock
markets. Commodities such as agricultural products and precious metals are examples
of futures contracts. Generally, derivatives are subsequently measured at their fair value
with a gain or loss reported in net income, except for derivatives that relate to a company’s
own shares, which are at historic cost.

LO 5: Explain the accounting treatments and reporting requirements
for stock options plans.
An employee stock option plan (ESOP) allows employees to purchase shares of the
company at a specified price, generally offered as a reward by the company to the
employee. As these employees are investing in the company, the proceeds of their shares
purchases are recorded to equity. In contrast, a compensatory stock option plan (CSOP)
is generally offered to key executives as part of their remuneration package. Their shares
entitlement is accrued to compensation expense as earned. Stock appreciation rights

Chapter Summary

127

(SARs) are an example of compensation based plans where compensation is paid based
on the movement of the common shares price, but no actual shares are bought or sold.
Performance-based plans use other performance indicators, such as growth in sales, as
a basis for compensation. Required disclosures of compensation plans are extensive and
include a description of the plan, the assumptions and methods used, and various other
data such as the dollar values of the options issued, exercised, forfeited, and expired.

LO 6: Recall that analyses of complex financial instruments use the
same techniques as those used in non-convertible debt and equity
instruments.
LO 7: Explain the similarities and differences between ASPE and
IFRS regarding recognition, measurement, and reporting of complex
financial instruments.
While IFRS and ASPE are quite similar in this case, differences do remain. For example,
regarding the issuance of complex financial instruments, ASPE provides the choice of
either the residual method or the zero-equity method, whereas only the residual method
is accepted for IFRS. Also, those instruments with contingent liabilities are treated as a
liability for IFRS, but are only treated as such with ASPE if the contingency is highly likely.
For options forfeitures in a CSOP, ASPE allows a policy choice to measure forfeitures
upfront as a change in estimate or later, as they occur; whereas with IFRS, these must
be measured upfront.

Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich
In October 2014, readers of business periodicals may have wondered if the headlines
were describing the writers’ lunch orders. However, the news about the “Double Irish”
and the “Dutch Sandwich” dealt with the more complicated issue of multinational
tax avoidance. In October 2014, the government of Ireland announced changes to
legislation that would effectively phase out the “Double Irish” tax-planning structure
favoured by many American technology companies such as Apple, Google, LinkedIn,
IBM, Yahoo, and Microsoft. The structure, while perfectly legal, was criticized because
it resulted in American corporations paying very little tax on their operations outside
of the United States. Some critics have claimed that these types of structures allow
multinational companies to avoid paying an equitable share of the tax burden.
The structure required the incorporation of two Irish companies, one of which was
considered by Irish law as being resident of an offshore, low-tax jurisdiction (typically
countries like Bermuda or the Bahamas). Through a series of arrangements and
transactions involving the licensing of intellectual property, the parent company could
essentially move profits out of a high-tax jurisdiction to a low-tax jurisdiction. The
“Dutch Sandwich” involves the addition of another subsidiary incorporated in the
Netherlands, which takes advantage of the European Union (EU) rules that allow
tax-free transfers between companies resident in EU countries.
The legislation introduced by the Irish government will eliminate the effectiveness of
the structure because new companies registered in Ireland will now also have to be
resident in Ireland. Critics have noted, however, that the legislation only applies to
newly incorporated companies and that existing companies will have until 2020 to
comply with the rules. It was also noted that, at the same time, the Irish government
introduced a “knowledge development box,” which would essentially allow for a lower
tax rate on profits derived from intellectual property. Other critics observed that
eliminating the “Double Irish” structure might simply result in EU-based tax havens
such as Malta becoming more popular.
Although the effects of the new legislation have yet to be fully realized, the long
time-frame allowed in the grandfather clause will likely mean that companies will
simply find other ways to minimize their tax payments. The fact that companies
invested substantial resources in the planning and development of these tax
structures should make it clear that income taxes are a significant issue for company
management. Income taxes can be a material expense item on many companies’

income statements, so the use of these types of tax structures should not be
surprising.

Introduction
The levy of taxes is a well-established method for governments to raise the funds necessary to carry out its various programs and initiatives. There are, of course, always
vigorous debates about the appropriate level of taxation and the uses to which the taxation
proceeds are put, but it is an inescapable truth that governments require some form of
taxation revenue to function. One form of taxation that is commonly used is an income

Introduction

137

tax. Most of us are familiar with the application of personal income tax, as this type
of tax is levied on employment and other forms of personal income. Governments also
raise funds through assessing income taxes on corporate profits. This practice raises
some interesting and complex accounting questions, and it is these questions that will be
addressed in this chapter. We will not, however, be examining the processes involved
in preparing corporate tax returns or the development of sophisticated tax structures like
the one described in the opening vignette, as our focus is on the financial accounting
and reporting issues. As well, we will not be looking at other forms of taxation, such
as value-added taxes or payroll taxes, as these topics have been discussed in previous
chapters.

A. Accounting for Income
Taxes under ASPE

15.1 Current Income Taxes Payable
When a company completes a fiscal year, it will produce a set of financial statements.
In most jurisdictions, the financial statements will be the starting point for the income tax
calculation. A corporate tax return will usually start with the net income before taxes or
accounting profit taken directly from the company’s income statement. This amount will
then be subject to a number of adjustments until the final result, the taxable profit or
taxable income, is determined. It is on this taxable profit that the corporate income tax

15.1. Current Income Taxes Payable

139

will then be levied.
There are a number of reasons that taxation authorities require adjustments to the accounting profit before levying the tax. As we have seen in previous chapters, there are
several areas in accounting standards where significant judgments or estimations are
required. As taxation regulations are written into laws, the authorities need to create
more certainty in interpretation to enable enforcement. Thus, some types of subjectively
determined amounts that are acceptable under IFRS may not be considered appropriate
for tax calculation purposes. Another reason is the need for consistency. Although
IFRS allows companies the flexibility to choose among different acceptable accounting
policies, taxation authorities are more concerned with fairness and transparency, which
often requires a higher level of consistency in treatment of certain types of transactions. A
third reason is the desire of governments to use the taxation system as a tool to achieve
policy goals. For example, if a government wanted to encourage investment in a specific
industry sector, it could allow certain tax incentives to those companies that invest in the
property, plant, and equipment required for those particular industry activities. These
incentives may create a difference in the way accounting profit and taxable profit are
calculated.
Regardless of the reasons for the differences, the accountant’s objective is to properly
record the appropriate income tax expense and outstanding income tax liability at the end
of the year. The simplest way to do this is to take the amount of tax owing, as determined
on the corporate tax return, and record it. Let’s look at an example to see how this would
work.
Assume that for financial statement purposes, a company reports revenue from a longterm contract on the basis of services rendered, which results in $30,000 net revenue per
year over a two-year period. As well, assume that no cash is received until the end of
the second year, and that the taxation authorities tax this revenue at a rate of 20% only
when the cash is received. Thus, no tax would be payable in the first year, and $12,000
($60,000 × 20%) tax would be payable in the second year. If we simply record the tax
expense when the taxation authority assesses it, the company’s income statement would
look like this:
Income before tax
Income tax expense
Net income

Year 1
Year 2
$ 30,000 $ 30,000
0 12,000
$ 30,000 $ 18,000

This is clearly not a satisfactory result, as the income tax expense has not been properly
matched to the revenue that created it. This approach, sometimes referred to as the taxes
payable method, is not allowed under IFRS due to this improper matching. It is, however,
allowed under ASPE, which will be discussed further in the Appendix.
To properly convey the economic substance of the transactions, the income tax expense

140

Income Taxes

should be $6,000 per year, which would result in net income of $24,000 per year. This
result would properly show how the reported income is attracting a tax liability, even
though the actual levy of the taxes does not occur until year 2. Thus, in year 1, the
company has created a deferred tax liability that will not need to be paid until year 2. It
is these deferred tax amounts that create complications in accounting, and as such, we
need to understand their nature in more detail.

15.2 Differences Between Accounting and Taxable
Profit
There are a variety of causes of the differences between accounting profit and taxable
profit. These can be summarized as follows:
Difference between
accounting and
taxable profit

Permanent
difference

Item is included in
accounting profit
but never in taxable
profit

profit

Temporary
difference

Item is included in
accounting profit
before it is included
in taxable profit

Item is included in
taxable profit before
it is included in
accounting profit

Let’s look at each of these situations.
Permanent Differences
These differences arise when an item is included in one type of reporting (accounting or
tax) but is permanently excluded from the other type of reporting. Items that are included
in the determination of accounting profit but not taxable profit can be both revenue and
expense items. An example of a revenue item would be a dividend received from another
company that is not taxed in the reporting jurisdiction. Many jurisdictions allow this taxfree flow of inter-corporate dividends. In this case, the dividend would be reported on
the company’s statement of profit, but would never be taxed. An example of an expense
item would be a sports club membership for the company’s executive officers. Many

15.2. Differences Between Accounting and Taxable Profit

141

businesses consider this type of item to be an appropriate form of promotion and business
development, but many tax authorities do not allow this to be deducted when calculating
taxable profit. Items that are included in taxable profit but never in accounting profit are
less common. These include such items as certain depletion allowances allowed for
natural resources and certain types of capital taxes that are not based on income.
The accounting treatment for permanent differences is quite straightforward. Because
these items do not affect future periods, there is no effect on future taxes. Thus, the
amount is simply included (or excluded) in the determination of current taxable profit and
the resulting tax payable is reported as a liability.
Temporary Differences
We can further classify temporary differences as follows:
Temporary
difference

Item is included in
accounting profit
before it is included
in taxable profit

Revenue item
(taxable)

Expense item
(deductible)

Item is included in
taxable profit before
it is included in
accounting profit

Revenue item
(deductible)

Expense item
(taxable)

Note that the items are classified as being either taxable or deductible. This feature
refers to the item’s effect on future tax calculations: taxable temporary differences increase future tax payable while deductible temporary differences decrease future tax
payable. For example, a warranty expense to reflect the cost of future repairs may be
accrued for accounting purposes, but the appropriate tax law does not allow any deduction
in determining taxable profit until the repairs are actually made. In this case, the expense
is a deductible temporary difference because it will allow for a deduction against taxable
profit in a future period when the repairs actually occur.
The following are some common examples of deductible and taxable temporary differences:

142

Income Taxes

Taxable

Deductible

Revenue Item
Construction revenue

Expense Item
Capital allowance in excess of depreciation

Instalment sales

Pension funding in excess of expense

Unrealized holding gains
Subscriptions paid in advance

Certain prepaid expenses
Capital allowance less than depreciation

Royalties and rent paid in advance

Pension expense in excess of funding

Sale and leaseback gains

Warranty accruals
Litigation accruals
Unrealized holding losses

These examples only represent a sample of the types of items that can result in temporary
differences. In determining the tax expense for the year, the accountant must consider the
effect on all items for which the accounting treatment and the tax treatment are different.
For example, with construction revenue, the company will normally choose the percentage
of completion method to recognize revenue for accounting purposes. However, many tax
jurisdictions will allow the company to defer the recognition of revenue on a long-term
construction contract until the project is completed. This will result in a future taxable
amount, as future revenue for tax purposes will be greater since the revenue has already
been recognized for accounting purposes.

15.3 Deferred Tax: Effect of Temporary Differences
An important point in understanding the effect of temporary differences on the company’s
tax expense is the fact that temporary differences reverse themselves. That is, whatever
effect the temporary difference has on the current tax expense, it will have an opposite
effect in some future period. To determine the amount that will reverse in the future,
we first need to consider how the temporary difference is calculated. IAS 12 defines
a temporary difference as the “differences between the carrying amount of an asset
or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base” (CPA Canada, 2016,
Accounting, IAS 12.5). Note that this definition uses a balance sheet perspective in that it
focuses on the balances in the statement of financial position rather than on revenue and
expense items recorded in the period. This is consistent with the conceptual framework,
which defines revenues and expenses in terms of changes in the net assets of the
business. To further understand this definition, we need to consider the item’s tax base,
which is “the amount attributed to [the] asset or liability for tax purposes” (CPA Canada,
2016, Accounting, IAS 12.5). The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible
in future periods against taxable economic benefits when the asset’s carrying amount is

15.3. Deferred Tax: Effect of Temporary Differences

143

recovered. If there is no future taxable benefit to be derived from the asset, then the tax
base is equal to the carrying amount. The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount,
less any amount that will be deductible in future periods with respect to the item. For
unearned revenue, the amount that is deductible in the future can be thought of as the
amount of revenue that is not taxable.
These definitions can be best understood by looking at a few examples:

• Goods are sold on credit to customers for $6,000, creating an account receivable
on the company’s records. This asset has a carrying value of $6,000 and tax law
requires that the amount to be reported as revenue in the period of the sale. Thus,
the amount is fully taxable in the current period and will not be taxable in the future
period. Because there is no future taxable benefit derived from this asset, its tax
base is $6,000 (i.e., equal to its carrying value) and there is no temporary difference.
• A company reports an accrued liability for warranty costs of $72,000, which is its
carrying value. This amount will not be deductible for tax purposes until the costs
are actually incurred. The tax base is the carrying value less the amount deductible
in future periods ($72,000 − $72,000), or $0. Thus, there is a deductible temporary
difference of $72,000.
• A company purchased a piece of equipment for $100,000 several years ago. The
current balance of accumulated depreciation is $36,000, thus the carrying value is
$64,000. For tax purposes, accelerated capital allowances of $52,000 have been
claimed and, therefore, the remaining balance that can be claimed for tax purposes
in the future is $48,000. The tax base is $48,000 and there is a taxable temporary
difference of $16,000 ($64,000 − $48,000).
• Current liabilities include $21,000 of unearned subscription revenue that was paid
in advance and the revenue was taxed in the current period when it was received.
The tax base is the carrying value ($21,000) less the amount that is deductible in
the future ($21,000, representing the revenue that will not be taxable), or $0. Thus,
there is a deductible temporary difference of $21,000 ($21,000 − $0).
• Included in current liabilities are accrued fines and penalties for late payment of
taxes in the amount of $8,000. These are not deductible for tax purposes. The
tax base is, therefore, $8,000 ($8,000 − $0). There is no difference between the
carrying value and the tax base. This is a permanent difference that only affects
current taxes, not future taxes.

There are many other examples of temporary and permanent differences. The definitions
above should always be applied to determine if a temporary difference exists or not, as
this will determine the need to record a deferred tax amount. In some cases, deferred tax
balances may result from a situation where there is no asset or liability recorded on the

144

Income Taxes

balance sheet. For example, a company may incur a research expense that cannot be
capitalized under IFRS. However, the amount may be deductible in a future period against
taxable income. In this case, there is no carrying value, as there is no asset, but there is
a future deductible amount. This would create a deductible temporary difference.

15.3.1 Calculation of Deferred Tax
Once the temporary and permanent differences have been analyzed, the deferred tax
amounts can be calculated and recorded. Let’s consider an example where the accounting depreciation and capital allowance for tax purposes are different.
A company purchases an asset on January 1, 2016, for $90,000. For accounting purposes, it will be depreciated straight-line over a three-year useful life with no residual
value. For tax purposes, assume that capital allowances can be claimed in the first year
equal to 50% of the asset’s cost, and in the second and third years equal to 25% of the
asset’s cost. The carrying values and tax values will, therefore, be calculated as follows:

Cost
Accumulated depreciation/
Cumulative capital
allowance
Carrying amount/tax base

Accounting Records
2016

The temporary differences are calculated as follows:
2016: $60,000 − $45,000
2017: $30,000 − $22,500
2018: $0 − $0

=

=

$15,000 taxable temporary difference
$7,500 taxable temporary difference
nil temporary difference

The company reports net income of $100,000 in 2016, $120,000 in 2017, and $150,000
in 2018 and pays tax at a rate of 20% on its taxable income. Assume that there are no
other differences between accounting and taxable income except the depreciation and
capital allowances.
Tax payable in each year would be calculated as follows:

15.3. Deferred Tax: Effect of Temporary Differences

Note that the tax payable above is the amount of expense that would be recorded if the
taxes payable method were used, which is only allowed under ASPE.
The deferred tax each year is calculated as follows:

(1,500)

Note that in 2016, the temporary difference creates a deferred tax liability. This is because
the capital allowance claimed is greater than the accounting depreciation, meaning less
tax is paid in the current year but more will be paid in future years. In 2017 and 2018, the
temporary difference reverses itself.

Income Taxes

The deferred tax income amounts in 2017 and 2018 represent a negative expense, or a
recovery of the expense that was previously charged in 2016. This represents the tax
effect of the reversal of the temporary difference. This type of negative expense may
sometimes be referred to as a deferred tax benefit.
Excerpts from the company’s income statements over the three years will look like this:

Income before tax
Income taxes:
Current
Deferred
Net income

2017

80,000

(25,500)
1,500
96,000

(31,500)
1,500
120,000

Note that each year the net income can be calculated as the income before tax multiplied
by 1 − tax rate (i.e., 100% − 20% = 80%). The reporting of the deferred tax amount
has achieved proper matching by allocating the correct total tax expense to each period,
which was the objective of the example examined in section 15.1.
Also note that even though the temporary difference reverses over a period of two years,
we have not attempted to account for the time value of money. IAS 12 explicitly prohibits
the discounting of future tax amounts, as it views the prediction of temporary difference
reversals too complex and impractical. The prohibition of discounting is a way to maintain
comparability between companies and acknowledges the trade-off between the costs and
benefits of this type of information production.

15.3.2 A More Complex Example
Let’s now look at a more complex example involving a deferred tax asset and a permanent
difference.
A company that sells computer printers offers a two-year warranty on each model sold.
The fair value of the warranty cannot be independently determined, so the company uses
the expense approach to determine the provision for the warranty liability. (See the current
liabilities chapter for further details of the application of this approach.) In 2016, the total
provision determined for future warranty costs was $80,000. The company expects that
the actual repair costs will be incurred as follows: $20,000 in 2017 and $60,000 in 2018.
No warranty repairs were incurred in 2016 when the sales were made. In the jurisdiction
where the company operates, warranty costs are only deductible for tax purposes when
they are actually incurred. As well, in 2017 the company received notice of a $5,000
penalty assessed for violation of certain consumer protection laws, and this penalty is not

15.3. Deferred Tax: Effect of Temporary Differences

147

deductible for tax purposes. The company reported accounting income of $320,000 in
2016, $350,000 in 2017, and $390,000 in 2018.
The warranty liability reported in 2016 represents a deductible temporary difference because it results in amounts that will be deductible against future taxable income (i.e., when
the warranty repairs are actually incurred). This will result in deferred tax asset originating
in 2016 and then reversing in 2017 and 2018. We can analyze this temporary difference
as follows:

Carrying amount, opening
Warranty costs incurred in year
Carrying amount, closing

Accounting Records
2016
2017
2018
80,000 80,000 60,000
0 20,000 60,000
80,000 60,000
0

Tax Records
2016 2017
2018
0
0
0
0 20,000 60,000
0
0
0

Note that the calculation of the carrying value for tax purposes, or tax base, follows the
general rule described previously for liabilities (i.e., the tax base is the carrying value for
accounting purposes less the amount deductible against future taxable income). Thus,
the tax base is always nil because the carrying value for accounting purposes always
represents the amount deductible against future taxable income.
The temporary differences are calculated as follows:
2016: $80,000 − $0 =
2017: $60,000 − $0 =
2018: $0 − $0
=

$80,000 deductible temporary difference
$60,000 deductible temporary difference
nil temporary difference

The penalty incurred in 2017 represents a permanent difference, as this amount will never
be deductible for tax purposes. Thus, this will only affect the current taxes in 2017 and
will have no effect on deferred taxes.
If we assume a 20% tax rate, the calculation of tax payable will be as follows:

Accounting income
Add non-deductible penalty
Add non-deductible warranty provision
Subtract deductible warranty costs
Taxable income
Tax rate
Tax payable

2016
320,000

The originating temporary difference in 2016 creates a deferred tax asset, which means
that more tax is being paid in the current year, but less tax will be paid in future years
when the temporary difference reverses itself.
The company will record the following journal entries each year for the tax amounts:

In 2016 and 2018, the total tax expense can be calculated as the income before tax
multiplied by the tax rate. Therefore, as previously discussed, proper matching has been

15.4. Tax Rate Changes

149

achieved. In 2017, the calculation does not reflect this result because of the effect of the
permanent difference. The permanent difference creates a difference between tax and
accounting income that will not reverse in future periods. Thus, there will be a permanent
difference between the nominal and effective tax rate in that year only. We can see
this in 2017, where the accounting income multiplied by the nominal tax rate is $70,000
($350,000 × 20%), but the total tax expense is $71,000 ($67,000 + $4,000). The $1,000
difference is due to the effect of the permanent difference, which results in an effective tax
rate of 20.29% ($71,000 ÷$350,000). Proper matching has still been achieved in this year
with respect to the temporary difference, but the permanent difference cannot be matched
to a different period.

15.4 Tax Rate Changes
So far our examples have assumed a constant tax rate over the period of temporary difference reversal. However, this may not always be the case, as tax rates and regulations
are subject to periodic changes as governments implement new policy directions. IAS
12 requires the deferred tax amounts to be measured at the rate expected to be in effect
when the related asset is realized or the liability is settled. The standard further states
that the rates should be enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the reporting
period. Substantively enacted means that although the rate may not be formalized into
law at the end of the reporting period, it has been publicly announced by the government
and is very likely to be subsequently altered through a legislative process. Let’s look at
an example of how this is applied.
A company reports $30,000 of instalment revenue in 2016 that will be paid in two equal
instalments in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, the revenue will be taxed when the payments
are actually received. The $30,000 receivable thus creates a taxable temporary difference
that reverses over the next two years, and this temporary difference will result in a deferred
tax liability. The government has recently announced that tax rates will be implemented
as follows: 2016 – 25%, 2017 – 22%, and 2018 – 20%.
The deferred tax liability would be measured as follows:
Total temporary difference arising in 2016
Amount reversing in 2017
Amount reversing in 2018
Total

$

30,000
(15,000)
(15,000)
$
0

× 22%
× 20%

=
=

$ 3,300
$ 3,000
$ 6,300

Thus, on the company’s 2016 balance sheet a deferred tax liability of $6,300 would be
reported and, on the 2016 income statement, a deferred tax expense of $6,300 would
also be reported.

Income Taxes

This situation is quite straightforward, as we simply apply the appropriate enacted rate
to the amount of the reversing temporary difference each year. However, there can be
complications if the reversal can be realized in different ways. For example, many tax
jurisdictions apply different tax rates to capital gains and ordinary income. In order to
properly determine the deferred tax amount related to an asset, an assumption needs to
be made about how the temporary difference will be realized (i.e., will the asset be used or
sold during the reversal period?). IAS 12 states that the rate applied should be consistent
with the company’s intended use of the asset. In other words, two identical assets could
result in different deferred tax amounts if one is to be sold and the other is to be used in
operations. This difference in treatment reflects the conceptual framework’s requirement
to convey the economic truth of a transaction, rather than the mere substance.
A more complicated situation arises when tax rates are changed after the deferred tax
amount has already been established in previous years. This type of change is treated as
a change in estimate and, as such, should be treated prospectively. This means that an
adjustment is made in the current period, but no attempt is made to restate prior years.
This treatment is considered reasonable as management would not have known about
the tax rate change when the deferred tax balance was originally established.
Let’s revisit the previous example, with one change. Assume that change in tax rates was
not announced until the middle of 2017, and that the 25% rate was already in effect for
2016. At the end of 2016, the company would have recorded a deferred tax liability of
$7,500 ($30,000 × 25%).
In 2017 when the rate change is announced, the company needs to recalculate the
deferred tax liability and adjust it accordingly. As such, the following journal entry would
be required:

Thus, in 2017 the company will report a total deferred tax income of $4,500, which
represents both the effect of the rate change on the opening temporary difference and

15.5. Unused Tax Losses and Tax Credits

the effect of temporary difference reversal during the year. Although this amount may be
reported as a single line item on the income statement, IAS 12 does require separate
disclosures for the effect of the temporary difference reversal and the effect of the rate
change.

15.5 Unused Tax Losses and Tax Credits
A company may, at times, suffer a taxable loss in a given year. Because income tax is
based on a percentage of taxable income, this situation results in no tax being payable.
However, it does not result in a negative tax (i.e., a refund). Instead, companies are
often allowed to apply the taxable loss to other taxation years where taxable profits were
earned. Although the tax laws vary by jurisdiction, it is common to allow the loss to be
carried back for a certain number of years and carried forward for a certain number of
years. In Canada, the current law allows the loss to be carried back 3 years and carried
forward 20 years.
When a loss is carried back and applied to previous years’ taxable income, the result will
be a refund of taxes paid in that year. This will be achieved by filing amended tax returns
for the previous year(s) showing the application of the loss, and then requesting a refund
of the taxes previously paid. It is important to note that the rate at which the taxes are
refunded will be the rate in effect in the previous year, not the current tax rate.
Consider the following example. In 2016, a company suffers a taxable loss of $100,000.
Taxable incomes reported in the three previous years were as follows:
2013
2014
2015

$10,000
86,000
90,000

The tax rates in effect were 30% in 2013, 25% in 2014 and 2015, and 20% in 2016. The
loss incurred in 2016 will be carried back and taxes will be recovered as follows:
2013 $10,000 × 30%
2014 $86,000 × 25%
2015
$4,000 × 25%
Total refund

Note that the total amount carried back cannot exceed the amount of the current year loss
($100,000). It is common practice for companies to apply the loss to the oldest tax years

152

first, and then apply remaining amounts to more recent years. However, other patterns
of application are also possible, depending on the circumstances of the company and the
tax rates in effect each year.

The company’s income statement will be presented as follows:

Income taxes:

Net loss

(100,000)
25,500
(74,500)

The income tax receivable will be presented as a current asset on the balance sheet, as
it should be recovered within one year. No other accounting entries are required in this
case.
A more complicated situation occurs when the amount of the current year tax loss exceeds
the taxable income of the previous three years. In this case, a portion of the current
tax loss is unused and may be carried forward. When carrying forward a tax loss, the
company is expecting to apply it to a future year when taxable income is once again
earned. However, this now creates uncertainty, because the company’s ability to earn
taxable income in the future is not guaranteed. IAS 12 states that a deferred tax asset
can be set up to recognize the benefit of the loss carried forward only if it is probable
that future taxable profit will be available to utilize the loss. Although the standard does
not define probable, an accepted interpretation of this term is “more likely than not.”
IAS 12 indicates that the presence of a loss itself casts some doubt on the company’s
ability to generate future profits. In assessing the probability of future taxable income,
the accountant should consider not only the presence of a current loss, but also other
factors such as the existence of temporary differences that will reverse in the future, the
persistence and nature of the current loss, and tax planning opportunities that may allow
the loss to be used in the future. This is another area where judgment on the part of the
accountant is required.
Let’s revisit our previous example, with one change. Assume now that the loss in the
current year is $300,000 and that all other factors remain the same. In this situation, the
company will first apply as much of the loss as possible to the previous three years. This
will generate a tax refund calculated as follows:

15.5. Unused Tax Losses and Tax Credits

153

2013 $10,000 × 30% = $ 3,000
2014 $86,000 × 25% = 21,500
2015 $90,000 × 25% = 22,500
Total refund
$47,000

In addition, the company needs to consider the effect of the loss carried forward, which is
calculated as $114,000 ($300,000 − $10,000 − $86,000 − $90,000). If, after assessing all
the relevant facts and conditions, the company believes it is probable that sufficient future
taxable profit will be generated to utilize the loss, a deferred tax asset can be recognized
as follows:

The amount is calculated as follows: $114,000 × 20% = $22,800. Note, as with other
deferred tax amounts, we are using the rate that we expect to be in effect when the
amount is realized. In this case, the current rate of 20% is used, as there is no indication
that the rate will change in the future.
The company would report the tax amounts on the 2016 income statement as follows:
Loss before tax
Income taxes:
Current tax income from loss carryback
Deferred tax income from loss carryforward
Net loss

(300,000)
47,000

(230,200)

Now, if in 2017 the company earns a profit of $250,000, the loss carryforward can be fully
utilized. By doing so, the company could reduce its current tax payable as follows:

The deferred tax expense represents the reversal of the benefit realized in 2016, when
the loss was initially created. The deferred tax asset would carry a nil balance at the end
of the 2017.
Returning to 2016, if the company had determined that it was not probable that it would
be able to generate future taxable profits to utilize the loss, then no deferred tax asset
would be recorded in that year. In a subsequent year, if profits were actually generated,
then the current tax expense for that year would simply be reduced by the effect of the
loss carryforward. In our example above, only the current tax entries would be recorded,
and the deferred tax recognition and reversal entries would not be recorded. Although this
treatment would mean presentation of a single, reduced current tax amount in the year
that the loss is utilized, disclosure must be made of the components of this reduced tax,
that is, the current tax otherwise calculated less the effect of the loss carryforward.

15.6 Deferred Tax Assets
As we have seen, deferred tax assets are created when there are loss carryforwards or
deductible temporary differences. Consistent with the conceptual framework, IAS 12 only

15.7. Presentation and Disclosure

155

allows recognition of these assets when their future realization is probable. However, as
discussed previously, there can be a fair degree of uncertainty in making this determination. As a result of this uncertainty, IAS 12 requires a review of any deferred tax assets at
the end of every reporting period. If the initial recognition assessment has changed, and
it is no longer probable that part or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized, then the
carrying value of the asset should be reduced and charged against profit as part of the
deferred tax expense.
The opposite situation, however, can also occur. If a deferred tax asset was not recognized in a previous period because the future realization was not probable, and conditions
in the current year have changed to the point that future realization is now probable, then
the deferred tax asset can be established and the income can be reported on the income
statement. Although this may create unusual effects on the company’s income statement,
the recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets is consistent with the conceptual
framework’s balance sheet approach to financial reporting.

15.7 Presentation and Disclosure
Income tax expense can be a significant portion of a company’s profit. As such, there
are a number of specific presentation and disclosure requirements for income taxes. The
requirements include:

• Tax expense (income) from ordinary activities
• Tax expense (income) from discontinued operations
• Tax amounts charged directly to equity and other comprehensive income
• Major components of tax expense (income), including:
– Deferred tax related to the origination and reversal of temporary differences
– Deferred tax related to changes in tax rates
– Current tax amounts related to prior period taxes
– The benefit arising from the utilization or recognition of previously unrecognized
tax losses
– Amounts of deferred tax asset write-downs
• Details of unrecognized deferred tax assets
• Details of temporary differences and the amount of related deferred tax recognized
on the balance sheet

156

Income Taxes

• Reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate actually
realized
There are also specific requirements in IAS 12 and IAS 1 regarding the balance sheet
presentation of tax amounts such as: (a) current taxes payable (receivable) should be
presented as a current liability (asset); (b) any deferred tax amounts should be presented
as non-current assets or liabilities; and (c) current tax assets and liabilities can only offset
each other if the company has the legal right to offset them and intends to settle them with
a net payment (receipt). This last situation would usually occur when a single taxation authority that allows offset assesses the taxes. A similar prohibition exists against offsetting
for deferred taxes, although there is a further condition that allows for offsetting of deferred
taxes originated by different entities within a group structure that will experience reversals
of temporary differences in a similar fashion or are allowed to offset current tax amounts.
In this case, the deferred taxes must still relate to the same taxation authority.

15.8 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
IFRS
Terminology: accounting and taxable
profit, deferred taxes, tax base, and tax
income.
Deferred tax asset is recognized when
the future realization is considered
probable. No valuation allowance is used.

Deferred tax balances are classified as
non-current.

More disclosures.
Companies can only apply the deferred
tax approach.

ASPE
Terminology: accounting and taxable
income, future income taxes, tax basis,
and tax benefit.
Future tax asset can be recognized for
the full amount of the effect of the
temporary difference, with an offsetting
valuation allowance used to reflect the
possibility that future realization is not
“more likely than not.”
Classification of future tax amounts will
depend on the classification of the
underlying asset or liability. If there is no
underlying asset or liability, classification
will be determined by the expected
reversal of the temporary differences.
Fewer disclosures.
Companies can choose between the
taxes payable method and the future
income taxes method. The future income
taxes method is similar to the deferred tax
approach, although some of the
terminology is slightly different.

15.9. Appendix A: Accounting for Income Taxes under ASPE

157

15.9 Appendix A: Accounting for Income Taxes under
ASPE
Under ASPE, a company has two choices of how to account for its income taxes: the
taxes payable method or the future income taxes method. The taxes payable method,
described previously, simply reports the balance of current taxes payable or receivable,
and no attempt is made to account for the effect of temporary differences. If a loss is
carried back, then the amount of the expected tax receivable can be recorded, however no
amount is considered with respect to the loss carried forward. Although this method can
result in a mismatched income tax expense, many small businesses choose it because
of its simplicity, as the amount of tax calculated on the tax return needs to be recorded
and nothing else. However, the company is still required to disclose a reconciliation of
the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and the amount of unused tax losses carried
forward. This simplified method is an example of how the cost versus benefit constraint is
applied to financial reporting standards.
If a company chooses the future income taxes method, it will follow procedures very
similar to what has been described in this chapter. Although the term future income
taxes is used instead of deferred taxes, the concepts are essentially the same. There are
other minor differences in terminology, as well, such as the use of income instead of profit
for both accounting and tax purposes, the use of tax basis instead of tax base, and the
use of tax benefit instead of tax income. Another difference in terminology is present in
the evaluation of future tax assets. ASPE only allows a future tax asset to be recorded
if its future realization is “more likely than not.” Although this term is not defined, it is
generally interpreted in the same way as “probable” in IFRS.
Another significant difference between the two standards deals with the treatment of future
tax assets. The initial calculation and measurement is similar under both standards,
however ASPE allows the use of a valuation allowance. This is essentially a contraaccount that reduces the future tax asset to a net amount that is “more likely than not” to
be realized. This means that the full amount of the future tax asset can be recorded and
offset by an amount believed to represent the risk that future income will not be sufficient
to realize the asset. Although, conceptually, this is different from the IFRS approach of
only recognizing an asset if its realization is “probable,” the net effect of the two methods
remains the same. That is, the “more likely than not” criteria used in ASPE to determine
the valuation allowance will generally produce the same result as the “probable” criteria
used by IFRS to determine the asset value.
Additionally, a difference exists between the two standards in the presentation of future
tax amounts. IFRS simply states that all deferred tax balances should be disclosed as
non-current items on the balance sheet. In ASPE, however, the classification of future tax
balances is more complicated as the classification of a future tax balance depends on the
classification of the underlying asset or liability. For example, if the temporary difference

158

Income Taxes

relates to the difference between depreciation taken for tax and accounting purposes,
then the future tax balance would be classified as non-current since the underlying asset
(property, plant, and equipment) is reported as non-current. If the temporary difference
relates to a difference in the treatment of warranty costs, then the future tax balance
would likely be classified as current because the underlying liability (warranty liability) is
classified as current. This rule can create a situation where a temporary difference may
result in the future tax balance being classified as both current and non-current. This could
happen if the underlying asset was an instalment receivable that required payments in the
next year and in subsequent years. If the future tax amount resulted from a temporary
difference that did not arise from a balance sheet amount, such as research costs, then
the classification would be based on the expected reversal of the temporary difference.
Again, this could result in a split classification of the amount.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Explain the relationship between taxable profit and accounting
profit and calculate current taxes payable.
Tax authorities apply certain rules in the calculation of taxable profit that differ from accounting rules. Taxable profit will, therefore, not always equal accounting profit. It is
common to use accounting profit as the starting point for the calculation of taxable profit,
and once taxable profit is determined, the appropriate tax rate is applied to calculate
current taxes payable.

LO 2: Explain what permanent and temporary differences are and
describe the deferred tax effects of those differences.
A temporary difference occurs when an income or expense item is recognized in a different reporting period for tax purposes than for accounting purposes. This is not the same
as a permanent difference, which is an item that is included in one type of reporting (tax
or accounting) but never the other. Permanent differences affect current taxes but have
no effect on future taxes. Temporary differences, on the other hand, will have an effect on
future accounting periods when the temporary difference reverses. Temporary differences
can be either taxable (i.e., they increase the future tax payable) or deductible (i.e., they
decrease the future tax payable).

Chapter Summary

159

LO 3: Calculate the deferred tax effects of temporary differences and
record the journal entries for current and deferred taxes.
When a temporary difference is identified, the deferred tax asset or liability is calculated
by multiplying the amount of the difference by the tax rate expected to be in effect when
the difference reverses. Current taxes are recorded as a debit to current tax expense and
a credit to current taxes payable. The deferred tax expense or income for the year will
be determined by comparing the current year’s deferred tax asset/liability balance to the
previous year’s deferred tax asset/liability balance. Deferred taxes will create either a debit
to deferred tax asset or a credit to deferred tax liability. A deferred tax asset will create
a credit on the income statement described as deferred tax income, while a deferred tax
liability will result in a debit on the income statement described as deferred tax expense.

LO 4: Determine the effect of changes in tax rates and calculate
current and deferred tax amounts under conditions of changing
rates.
Current taxes should always be calculated at the rate currently in effect. Deferred taxes
are calculated at the rate expected to be in effect when the temporary difference reverses.
This will be based on the rates in effect or substantively enacted at the reporting date. If a
future tax rate changes after the deferred tax amount has already been recorded, then the
deferred tax amount must be adjusted for the effect of the rate change. This adjustment is
prospective and, thus, prior periods are not adjusted. The effect of the rate change needs
to be disclosed separately from the other components of deferred tax expense.

LO 5: Analyze the effect of tax losses and determine the appropriate
accounting of those losses.
Current tax losses can often be carried back or carried forward and applied against
taxable profits for other years. When losses are carried back, a receivable and a tax
income amount will be established based on the rates in effect in the previous years.
When losses are carried forward, a determination must be made whether the future
realization of these losses is probable or not. If it is not probable, then no amount is
recorded until such time as the benefit of the loss is actually realized, resulting in no
deferred tax asset being carried on the balance sheet. If it is, in fact, probable, then
a deferred tax asset and deferred tax income amount is recognized based on the rate
expected to be in effect when the loss is utilized. In the future year when the loss is
utilized, the deferred tax asset is eliminated and a deferred tax expense is recorded.

160

Income Taxes

LO 6: Explain the rationale for the annual review of deferred tax
assets and describe the effects of this review.
A fair degree of uncertainty exists around the future benefits that can be derived from
tax losses. The benefit of a tax loss can only be realized if there is sufficient taxable
profit, or reversals of taxable temporary differences, in the future. Although the criteria
for recognition may be met in one accounting period, circumstances can change in a
later period, creating doubt about the amount that can be realized. As such, a review
of deferred tax assets is required at every reporting period to determine if the recognition
criteria still holds true. If it doesn’t, then the deferred tax asset needs to be partially or fully
derecognized and an expense recorded. If a previously unrecorded tax loss now meets
the probability criteria, then the benefit and asset will be recorded in the current year.

LO 7: Prepare the presentation of income tax amounts on the
balance sheet and income statement and explain the disclosure
requirements.
Current taxes payable should be disclosed as a current liability, and deferred tax assets or
liabilities should be disclosed as non-current items. Note that different rules apply under
ASPE. The components of deferred tax should be disclosed as well as a description of
temporary differences. Unrecognized tax losses should be disclosed as well as the effect
of tax rate changes, and a reconciliation of the statutory and effective tax rates needs to
be disclosed as well.

LO 8: Explain the key differences between the treatment of income
taxes under IFRS and ASPE.
Under IFRS, companies can only use the deferred tax approach, whereas under ASPE,
companies can choose either the taxes payable method or the future income taxes method.
Under IFRS, a deferred tax asset can only be recognized if future realization is probable,
while under ASPE, the realization must be more likely than not. As well, ASPE allows
the use of a valuation allowance. Under IFRS, all deferred tax balances are classified
as non-current, whereas under ASPE, the classification will depend on the underlying,
asset, liability, or temporary difference. There are differences in disclosure requirements
and terminology as well.

The present value of the costs for the future
site remediation of an oil-drilling property
has been capitalized as part of the asset’s
carrying value. This will increase the amount
of depreciation claimed over the life of the
asset. These costs are not deductible for tax
purposes until they are actually incurred.
A revaluation surplus (accumulated other
comprehensive income) is reported for assets accounted for under the revaluation
model. The gains will not be taxed until the
respective assets are sold.
Included in current assets is a prepaid expense that is fully deductible for tax purposes
when paid.
A penalty is paid for the late filing of the
company’s income tax return. This penalty
is not deductible for tax purposes.

EXERCISE 15–2
A company reports an accounting profit of $350,000. Included in the profit is $100,000
of proceeds from a life insurance policy for one of the key executives who passed away
during the year. These proceeds are not taxable. As well, the company charged accounting depreciation that was $20,000 greater than the capital allowances claimed for
tax purposes.
Required: Calculate the amount of taxes payable and the income tax expense for the
year. The current tax rate is 20%.

Corin Ltd. began operations in 2016 and reported a deferred tax liability balance of
$17,500 at the end of that year. This balance resulted from the difference between
the amount of depreciation charged for accounting purposes and the capital allowances
claimed for tax purposes. The carrying amount of the asset in the company’s accounting
records on December 31, 2016, was $320,000. The tax rate of 25% has not changed for
several years and is not expected to change in the future. Also, by the end of December
2016, all current taxes had been paid.
In 2017, the company reported the following:
• Accounting profit for the year was $416,000.
• The company began offering a one-year warranty to its customers in 2017. A
warranty provision was established, resulting in a reported expense of $73,000.
Actual warranty costs incurred during the year were $17,000. For tax purposes,
warranty costs can only be deducted when actually paid.
• In 2017, entertainment costs of $28,000 were paid and expensed. For tax purposes,
only 25% of these amounts can be claimed.
• In 2017, the company expensed depreciation of $50,000 and claimed capital allowances for tax purposes of $58,000. There were no sales or disposals of property,
plant, and equipment during the year.

Genaro Publishing Ltd. is a publisher of a wide range of consumer magazines. The
company reported the following on its December 31, 2016, balance sheet:
Income tax receivable
Deferred tax asset

$16,250
38,400

The deferred tax asset relates to two temporary differences: subscription revenue and
depreciation. The company receives subscription payments in advance on the magazines
it publishes, the amounts are taxed immediately when they are received, but are reported
as revenue as they are earned over the subscription period. On December 31, 2016,
the balance in the unearned revenue account was $247,000 and it was expected to be
earned as follows:
2017
2018
2019

$95,000
80,000
72,000

The company’s printing equipment is currently being depreciated on a straight-line basis
and the carrying amount of the equipment on December 31, 2016, was $357,000. For
tax purposes, the equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method and the
tax base on December 31, 2016, was $238,000. A single taxation authority assesses the
company, and payments/receipts are settled on a net basis. The income tax receivable
resulted from a taxable loss suffered in 2016 that was fully carried back to previous
taxation years. The tax rate enacted on December 31, 2016, was 30%.
In 2017, the company reported the following:
Accounting profit

The depreciation relates to a single asset that was purchased early in 2016 for $200,000,
and there were no other asset purchases or sales during the five years. The tax rates
were enacted in each year and the changes were not known prior to the year to which
they apply. In 2018, management carried back the loss to the fullest extent possible and
estimated that there was an 80% probability that future taxable profits would be available
to use the remaining loss carried forward. In 2019, management revised this estimate
to a 10% probability, and in 2020, management utilized the maximum possible amount
of the loss carried forward. In all years, management estimated that future reversals of
temporary differences would be available to utilize the benefits of any deferred tax assets
other than the losses carried forward.
Required:

a. Calculate the balance of the deferred tax liability or asset and related adjustment
required for the temporary difference related to depreciation at the end of each year.
b. Calculate the current tax payable for each year.
c. Calculate the balance of the deferred tax asset related to the loss carried forward at

December 31, 2016, and is taxable when collected.
** Note: The company commenced a single construction contract during the year. The
contract revenue has been reported using the percentage of completion method, but the
completed contract method is used for tax purposes. The company expects the project to
be completed in 2017.
Also, there are no other temporary or permanent differences aside from those identified
above. The current tax rate is 30%, which has been in effect for several years.

Chapter 16
Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

Golden Years for Bombardier Employees?
In previous generations, employees yearned for a stable job where they could work
until retirement. The dream included a reasonable pension that allowed retirees
the chance to enjoy a comfortable life. However, changes in demographics and
economics have altered the retirement landscape. These changes not only affect
the employees but also the companies for which they worked. Bombardier Inc.,
a Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and rail transportation systems, provides an
example of the effects of these changes.
At the end of December 2014, Bombardier reported a net loss of $1.2 billion USD.
Contributing to this loss was a net pension expense of $400 million, an amount
that represents over 70% of the company’s loss before tax and interest. But this
expense only tells part of the story. Bombardier also reported pension plan assets
of $8.8 billion and a pension plan obligation of $10.9 billion, leaving an unfunded
obligation of approximately $2.1 billion. This unfunded obligation had increased by
over $500 million from the previous year, but still represented an improvement over
the company’s highest unfunded obligation of $2.9 billion, reported in 2011.
Pension obligations represent the present value of future payments to be paid to
retired employees. These payments are often based on the employees’ highest salary
during their employment and usually continue until the employees’ death. Because
of this, the actual amount paid out in the future can only be estimated, and this is
done using an actuary. Actuaries are professionals trained in statistical sciences who
use existing data and assumptions to make these predictions. With improvements
in medical technologies, people are living longer than they once did, and actuarial
calculations of the pension obligation reflect this. As well, investment returns on
pension plan assets suffered during the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession.
Increased pension obligations and reduced returns have increased the unfunded
amount of pensions for many companies, including Bombardier.
A further complicating factor is the rate used to discount the obligation. In
Bombardier’s case, a 1% drop in the discount rate used in 2014 resulted in an increase
in the pension obligation of over $1.4 billion. This was offset, in part, by improved
asset values, but this discount rate provides an example of a factor that management
cannot control.
Many companies carry similar unfunded pension liabilities on their balance sheets
169

170

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

and it is becoming increasingly challenging for managers to deal with this problem.
A drastic way to address the growing liability is to stop admitting new members to
the pension plan. Bombardier did this in 2013, and other companies have taken
similar steps. This may limit the scale of the problem, but the managers still need
to find ways to fund a liability whose amount changes in response to unpredictable
factors. The managers also need to deal with the more subtle and complex problem
of managing employee expectations when those employees receive differing levels of
benefits. This, in fact, may prove to be a bigger challenge than finding the funds to
maintain existing plans.

Introduction
Changing demographic patterns have recently thrust pension plans into the headlines.
Many mature economies are experiencing low or non-existent growth combined with an
aging population. A combination of declining birthrates and improvements in health care
is shifting the overall composition of certain populations to people of retirement age. This
shift creates a challenge for both public and private pension plans, many of which were
established when expectations about life after retirement were quite different. As pension
plans are put under increased pressure, it becomes even more important for stakeholders
to have a clear understanding of the financial status of the plans and the risks they face
as sponsors of the plans. This chapter will examine the accounting issues surrounding
private (non-government) pension plans, as well as the treatment of other employment
benefits offered by employers. This chapter only deals with the accounting issues of the
employer providing the employment and post-employment benefits. The accounting for
the pension plan and other benefit plans themselves (i.e., the accounting performed by
the trustee of the pension plan assets) is described in IAS 26 and is not covered in this
chapter.

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

16.1 Definition
The term pension plans is not specifically used in IAS 19 (CPA Canada, 2016). Instead
it refers to “post-employment benefit plans,” which are simply arrangements by which
employers offer benefits to employees after the completion of their employment. However,
as the term pension plan is widely used and understood, this chapter will use it to
distinguish such plans from other types of post-employment benefits.
A key element in the definition of employee benefits in IAS 19 is that the benefits are
payable in exchange for service by the employee. This is generally how most employees
understand the concept of a pension plan: each year of employment entitles the employee
to a future payment that will be received after the employee retires from the job. The
pension plan is designed to encourage a sense of loyalty in the employee by providing a
benefit that cannot be realized until the employee has spent often many years in the job.
The plan also provides a sense of security to the employee, which is provided in exchange
for the employee’s service to the company. From an accounting perspective, the important
questions are: Who pays for the plan? How will the plan’s activities be measured? How
will the plan be reported?

16.2 Types of Pension Plans
There are two general forms that pension plans can take: they can be defined contribution
plans or defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan refers to a plan where the
employer pays a fixed contribution into a fund and has no further legal or constructive
obligation to provide additional funds should the plan not have sufficient resources to pay
the required benefits in the future. A defined benefit plan is simply any other postemployment benefit plan that does not meet this definition. Under a defined benefit plan,
the employer does hold a legal or constructive obligation to provide additional funds to the
plan if the resources are not sufficient to pay the required benefits. Accounting for defined
contribution plans is quite straightforward, whereas accounting for defined benefit plans
is more complicated. We will examine both types of plans.

16.3 Defined Contribution Plans
With this type of plan, the amount the employer contributes is defined by the contract
or relationship the employer has negotiated with its employees. This means that the
employer has agreed to fund the plan at a specified amount, usually calculated as a fixed
amount or as some percentage of the employee’s pay. However, the employer has not

16.4. Defined Benefit Plans

173

agreed to provide any specific amount of pension income to the employee once he or she
retires. The amount of pension income available to the employee will depend on how the
pension plan assets have performed over the years. The pension plan assets are usually
delivered to an independent trustee who will be given the task, and legal right, to invest
the assets on behalf of the employees, and this trust is legally separate from the employer.
While the trustee will prudently invest the assets in order to provide pension payments to
the employees when they retire, there is no guarantee of how much retirement income
an individual employee will receive as these funds are subject to investment risk. With a
defined contribution plan, the employee bears all of the investment risk, as the employer
has only agreed to contribute a specified amount to the plan.
Because the employer bears no investment risk, and no obligation for future pension
payments, the accounting for the employer is quite simple. The amount the employer has
agreed to pay on behalf of the employees is simply recorded as an expense every year,
usually described as a pension or post-employment benefit expense. A liability would
only be recorded if the company had not remitted the required funds to the pension
plan trustee by the end of the fiscal year. It is also possible that an asset could be
recorded if the employer had remitted more funds to the trustee than were required by the
agreement with the employees. If either a liability or asset exists at the end of the fiscal
period, it would likely be classified as current, as it would normally be expected that the
amount would be settled within one year. However, there can be situations where future
contributions may be required for current service under a defined contribution plan, such
as a deferred contribution required under the terms of a collective agreement negotiated
with an employee union. In this case, the future contributions would need to be discounted
using the same interest rate as would be applied to a defined benefit plan.

16.4 Defined Benefit Plans
Defined benefit plans are the opposite of defined contribution plans. With a defined benefit
plan, the amount of pension income the employee will receive upon retirement is defined
either as a pre-determined amount or by calculation using a prescribed formula. Because
the ultimate payment from the plan is defined, the risks of the plan now fall upon the
employer. If the plan fails to retain sufficient assets to pay out the defined pension benefits,
the employer is required to make up the difference through additional contributions. As
noted in the example of Bombardier, this amount can be significant.
An important concept of defined benefit plans is that of vesting. Vesting refers to the
principle that employees are entitled to receive certain benefits even if they cease to be
employed by the company. Non-vested benefits are those that are lost once the employee
ceases to provide service to the employer. With pension plans, there is usually a minimum
term of service that is required before the pension benefits will vest.

174

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

Because the employer is responsible for the defined benefit that the pension plan will
ultimately pay out, the accounting becomes more complicated. This is because the
existence of the defined benefit creates a liability to the company. The liability represents
the present value of future cash flows related to the payment of pensions to retired
employees. Offsetting this liability are the assets held by the trustee in the pension plan.
Employee
provides service

Pension payment
made to employee
after retirement

Employer makes
contributions to plan

Pension plan holds
assets in trust

Although it is fairly easy to determine the fair value of the assets held by the trustee, it is
not as simple to determine the present value of future pension payments. A number of
assumptions and estimates are required to make this determination, including:

• When will the employee retire?
• How long will the employee live after retirement?
• What level of salary will the pension payments be based on?
• What return will be earned on the plan assets in the future?
• What discount rate is appropriate for the present value calculation?

Accountants generally don’t have the specialized knowledge or expertise to make these
kinds of estimates. However, a particular group of professionals called actuaries can help
with this process. Actuaries are trained in statistical sciences and they understand how to
use existing data to make these kinds of determinations. Because pension payments are
often made far in the future, and are based on unknowable factors such as an employee’s
lifespan, there is the potential for estimation error. As such, an accountant will often
review the work of the actuary to ensure it is appropriate for financial reporting purposes.
Although IAS 19 does not require the use of actuaries, it is unlikely that an accountant

16.4. Defined Benefit Plans

175

would have sufficient technical knowledge to carry out these calculations on his or her
own, except in the case of the most basic pension plan arrangements.
So what exactly does the actuary measure? The main focus of the actuary’s work is
called the defined benefit obligation (DBO). This represents the present value of all
future pension payments for current employees, based on their expected salaries at the
time they retire. This calculation takes into account all service provided by the employees
up to the reporting date, but it does not include future service. However, a key assumption
is that the pension plan will continue to operate and employees will continue to work until
their expected retirement date. This calculation requires estimations regarding employee
turnover, inflation, and other factors affecting future salaries, such as expected retirement
dates and mortality. Note that this calculation also includes estimates related to unvested
benefits, as it is expected that the benefits will vest to the employees in the normal course
of their employment.
The balance of the defined benefit obligation will be affected by a number of factors each
year:

• Current service cost
• Interest on the obligation
• Benefits paid to retirees
• Past service costs and plan amendments
• Actuarial gains and losses

Current service cost is an essential element to the pension obligation. It represents the
present value of future benefits required to be paid to current employees, based on the
service they have provided in the current accounting period. This amount is estimated by
the actuary, taking into account the formula for calculating the pension entitlement, the
expected number of years until retirement, and other actuarial factors. The amount is
calculated using the projected unit credit method, which allocates the ultimate pension
benefit payable in roughly equal proportions over the employee’s working life. This present
value technique, thus, will take into account the effect of future salary increases on the
current service obligation.
The interest cost on the obligation is a basic concept that reflects the time value of
money. Because the payments to retirees will be made in the future, the obligation must be
discounted to its present value. As time passes, interest must be accrued on the obligation
during each accounting period, increasing the obligation’s carrying value each period
until it reaches the ultimate amount payable to the employee on the date of retirement.
Although the correct accounting treatment requires calculation of the interest cost based

176

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

on actual transactions in the plan during the year, a simplifying assumption we will make
is that transactions occur at the end of the year. This means that, unless otherwise stated,
we will assume that the interest cost is based on the opening balance of the DBO.
The third essential element in the calculation of the DBO is the value of benefits paid to
retirees. As these benefits are paid, the obligation is reduced because the company is
fulfilling its obligation to its employees under the plan. These payments will reduce the
outstanding present value otherwise calculated.
Sometimes a pension plan may be amended or additional pension entitlements granted.
This could occur, for example, when a company first commences a new pension plan
and wants to grant entitlement to long-serving employees for their service prior to the
start of the plan. Or, with an existing plan, the company may want to grant additional
pension entitlements to certain groups of employees, such as those who have joined the
company through a merger. It is also possible that a company could reduce future pension
benefits payable to employees, such as through a renegotiation of collective agreements
with unions resulting from reorganization or other type of financial distress. Whatever
the reason, the change in the future benefits resulting from past service costs must be
adjusted and reflected in the DBO.
The last element of the DBO is perhaps the most difficult to determine. Actuaries, as
noted before, are trained in analyzing and using various types of data to make their
predictions and calculations of the DBO. However, predicting the future is imprecise
and sometimes the actuary will need to change the projected amounts based on new
calculations. These new calculations could result from observations of actual patterns
that are different from what was previously predicted, or from completely new data that
changes the existing assumptions. For example, if during the year there was a significant
turnover of employees and the new group is significantly younger than the previous group,
the calculation of the DBO would change. Similarly, if new scientific data were released
showing that, on average, people are now living longer due to improved health-care
services, the DBO would have to be adjusted. Changes in actuarial assumptions are
a normal part of the process of estimating the DBO, resulting in actuarial gains or losses
during the period.
Aside from the DBO, the other major element of the pension plan is the assets the pension
plan holds in trust for the employees. The assets are typically held in a separate entity
from the company and are usually legally restricted in a way that prevents their conversion
for use in settlement of other non-pension liabilities of the company. The plan assets will
usually be held in low-risk investments such as high-quality debt and equity securities,
stable real estate properties, cash and other cash equivalents. The goal of the plan
is to earn a reasonable return without taking too much risk. However, even a prudent
investment strategy can be mismanaged, as discovered by pension fund managers after
the 2008 financial crisis, who found that some of the double and triple-A securities they
had invested in were not as sound as first believed.

16.4. Defined Benefit Plans

177

There are three determinants of the value of the pension plan assets:

• Contributions by the employer, and in some cases, the employee
• The actual return on the assets
• Benefits paid to retirees

Contributions are payments made by the employer to the plan based on agreed upon
amounts. This would typically be an amount determined by the actuary and is often based
on a percentage of employee salaries. In some cases, the employees will also contribute
their own money to the plan. This is referred to as a contributory plan. The amount the
employee contributes will often be based on tax legislation in the relevant jurisdiction.
The return on the plan’s assets consists of various types of investment returns, such
as interest, dividends, and gains and losses on the disposal of plan assets (less any
administration fees charged by the pension plan manager). Additionally, IAS 19 requires
the plan’s assets to be valued at their fair values, meaning that unrealized gains and
losses will also be included in the final balance. Because certain investment markets can
be volatile, the actual return earned on the assets from year to year can vary significantly.
However, most plan managers will attempt to diversify their portfolios and apply prudent
investment strategies to minimize this risk.
As noted previously, actual pension benefits paid to retirees reduce the obligation of the
plan. However, they also reduce the assets in the plan.

16.4.1 Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans
Although there are a number of complex elements that comprise defined benefit pension
plans, the accounting concern of the company reporting under IFRS is simpler. On
the sponsoring company’s accounting records, only four relevant accounts need to be
considered: the pension expense that will be recorded each year, the net defined benefit
asset or liability that will appear on the balance sheet, the cash that is contributed to the
plan, and the company’s other comprehensive income (OCI). We will examine how each
of these accounts is affected by the pension plan transactions.
It is important to note that the pension plan assets and obligation are not recorded anywhere on the sponsoring company’s financial statements, as these are held by the trustee
in the pension plan. Changes in the pension plan’s obligation and assets are, however,
accounted for indirectly on the sponsoring company’s financial statements. This is done
in the following manner:

178

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

• Current and past service costs are reported in net income.
• Net interest is reported in net income.
• Gains and losses from re-measurements of the net asset or liability are reported in
other comprehensive income.
• Cash contributions to the plan reduce the company’s liability.
This treatment will result in a net defined benefit expense being reported on the income
statement (an adjustment to OCI) and an amount, the net defined benefit liability, being
reported on the balance sheet equal to the net difference between the DBO and the fair
value of the plan assets. One important point to note in the accounting treatment is the
manner in which interest is recorded. Interest on the DBO should be calculated using
an appropriate interest rate, which IAS 19 suggests should be a market-based interest
rate that is comparable to the current yield on high-quality debt instruments, such as
corporate bonds. The rate used would normally be the rate present at the end of the
reporting period. A further requirement of IAS 19 is that the interest rate used to discount
the DBO should also be used to calculate the return on the plan assets. In other words,
the interest cost is calculated only on the net balance of the obligation. The result of using
the same interest rate for determining the return on plan assets is that there will likely be
a difference between the calculated amount and the actual return on the assets. This
difference is accounted for in OCI, much in the same manner as remeasurement gains or
losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions.
The accounting treatment for pensions under ASPE is slightly different. These differences
will be explained in 16.9 Appendix A.
The accounting treatment under IFRS is best illustrated with an example. Consider the
following facts: Ballard Ltd. initiated a defined benefit pension plan in 2010. On January
1, 2015, the balance of the DBO as determined by an actuary was $535,000, and the fair
value of the plan assets was $500,000.

An easy way to understand the accounting for pension plan transactions is to use a
worksheet. The worksheet can help organize the relevant data and provides reconciliation

16.4. Defined Benefit Plans

between the company’s records and the amounts held in the pension plan. The worksheet
format that we will use is comprised of two parts. The left-hand portion represents the
amounts held in the pension plan. These are not accounted for directly in the company’s
records. The right-hand side of the worksheet represents the company’s accounting
records. The data on this side can be used to directly generate the journal entries
required and also provides a way to compare the company’s records to those of the
pension plan. In our worksheet we will use Debit (DR) and Credit (CR) notations even
though the company does not directly record all parts of the worksheet. The use of DR
and CR will help us understand how to reconcile the pension plan and company records.
Let’s start with the worksheet for 2015:

1. Interest on DBO = $535,000 × 8% = $42,800
2. Interest on assets = $500,000 × 8% = $40,000
3. Remeasurement gain = $43,000 (actual earnings) − $40,000 (calculated above) = $3,000

There are a few key points to note from the worksheet:
• The net defined benefit balance at the start of the year represents the amount
the company would report on its balance sheet. It also represents the difference
between the opening balances of the DBO and the plan assets.
• The interest on the DBO and the plan assets is calculated by simply taking the
appropriate interest rate and multiplying it by the opening balance of each item. This
calculation has assumed that all pension transactions occur at the end of the year. In
practice, pension transactions may occur throughout the year. In that case, interest
would need to be calculated on the weighted-average balance in each account.
• Benefits paid to retirees do not affect the company’s accounting records, as these
transactions occur between the pension plan and the retirees directly.

180

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

• The remeasurement gain represents the difference between the interest calculated
on the plan asset balance and the actual return earned by those assets during the
year. This gain is taken directly to other comprehensive income.

From this worksheet, the company would make the following journal entry:

The result of this journal entry is a credit of $6,800 to the net defined benefit liability
that is reported on the company’s balance sheet. This agrees with the calculation on
the worksheet. In practice, the part of the journal entry reflecting the cash contributions
by the company would be recorded throughout the year as the company remits pension
payments to the plan. On the company’s balance sheet, a net defined benefit liability of
$41,800 would be disclosed. This would usually be disclosed as a non-current liability,
as it is not normal for a pension liability to be settled within the next year. This balance
also represents the net underfunding of the plan at the end of the year. This means
that the pension plan does not have sufficient assets to settle the future expected liability
for pension payments. In the short term this is not really a problem, as the pension
plan payments will occur over a period of many years and it is possible to correct an
underfunded plan over time. However, if a pension plan remains chronically underfunded,
this may result in problems making payments to retirees. With a defined benefit plan, the
sponsoring company will ultimately be responsible for making up this difference, although
employees may also be asked to contribute if the plan is contributory. The plan could also
be overfunded, which would mean that the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the DBO.
This excess amount belongs to the sponsoring company, although legal requirements may
prevent the company from withdrawing the amount from the plan. Usually, the excess
would be recovered through a reduction of future contributions.
The company would also disclose a pension expense of $59,800 on the income statement and a $3,000 credit to other comprehensive income. There are further disclosure
requirements, which are detailed later in this chapter.
Let’s now look at the 2016 transactions:

3. Remeasurement loss = $35,000 (actual earnings) − $45,840 (calculated above) = ($10,840)

The process used is the same as was applied in 2015. However, note one additional
difference in 2016: the actuary revised some of the actuarial assumptions. This could
result from new data regarding life expectancy, changes in assumptions about expected
period of service of employees, changes in assumptions about future wage levels, and
several other factors. The change in the assumptions has resulted in an actuarial gain,
which means the present value of the future pension payments (and thus, also the DBO)
has been reduced. This reduction to the DBO has been recorded as a credit to other
comprehensive income and does not directly affect the pension expense recorded. In this
example, we have assumed that the change in assumptions occurred at the end of the
year. If the change occurred at some other time during the year, the interest calculation
would need to be adjusted to reflect weighted average DBO balance throughout the year.

3. Remeasurement gain = $70,000 (actual earnings) − $57,600 (calculated above) = $12,400

Note that the cost of additional pension benefits granted to employees based on their past
service has been immediately expensed. This amount represents the increase in the DBO
calculated by the actuary as a result of giving the employees these benefits. The granting
of these entitlements is treated as a new event, so it would not be appropriate to adjust
prior periods for the additional amount. It would also be inappropriate to capitalize this
amount as the employee service that has generated the benefit has already occurred
(i.e., there is no future benefit to the company). The result is a significantly larger pension
expense in the current year. The company will also report a significantly higher liability,
$125,663, on its balance sheet.

183

16.4.2 Net Defined Benefit Asset
In our examples, the net defined benefit balance was always in a credit position, meaning
the plan was underfunded. However, a plan can be overfunded as well, meaning the fair
value of the assets held in the plan exceeds the actuarially determined present value of
the DBO. This doesn’t create any particular accounting problem, as the amount would
simply be reported as an asset on the sponsoring company’s balance sheet. However,
IAS 19 requires that the balance of an overfunded plan be reported at the lesser of:
• The amount of the surplus (the overfunding in the plan)
• The asset ceiling
The asset ceiling is defined as the present value of “future economic benefits available to
the entity in the form of a reduction in future contributions or a cash refund, either directly
to the entity or indirectly to another plan in deficit” (CPA Canada, 2016, IAS 19.65.c).
The present value would be determined using the same interest rate as was used in the
pension expense calculations. This provision ensures that the net asset reported under
the plan does not exceed the present value of the amount that is reasonably expected to
be recovered from the overfunded plan.

16.5 Other Post-Employment Benefits
In addition to pension plans, employers will often provide other types of post-employment
benefits to their employees. While there are many other benefits that employers may
offer to encourage long service by employees, the most common is additional health
care coverage. As IAS 19 requires other post-employment benefits to be accounted for
in essentially the same manner as pension plans, this can create some measurement
challenges because the use of these benefits is less predictable than a regular monthly
pension payment. Health care costs will be incurred when the retired employee becomes
ill, and the required amounts to be paid are widely variable. However, despite these
measurement challenges, the amounts must still be estimated and accounted for in order
to provide a true and fair representation of the company’s financial position.

16.6 Other Employment Benefits
Employers also offer many incentives and benefits to their employees while they are still
employed. Some benefits, such as vacation time, may be required by law while other ben-

184

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

efits, such as paid sabbaticals, may not be. When determining the accounting treatment
for these types of benefits, it is important to understand whether the benefits vest or not.
When employment benefits vest with service, they should be accounted for in a similar
manner to pension plans (i.e., the amount of the future payment should be estimated and
accrued). In the case of short-term benefits, such as annual vacations, the amount is not
usually discounted. These types of benefits were covered in more detail in Chapter 12:
Current Liabilities. For long-term employment benefits, such as paid sabbaticals, the
treatment is also similar to that of pension plans, except that remeasurement gains and
losses are accounted for in net income, and not in other comprehensive income.
For employment benefits that do not vest, the accounting treatment is simpler. An example
of a benefit that does not vest is a monthly sick leave allowance. An employee may be
allowed a certain number of sick days every month, but these do not accumulate if they
are not used. In this case, an expense is recorded when the benefit is actually used by
the employee, but no accrual is made for any unused amounts. This type of benefit was
covered in more detail in Chapter 12.

16.7 Presentation and Disclosure
The complexities and estimations involved in pension plans have resulted in fairly significant disclosure requirements. Pension plans can create a significant liability to companies, so it is important that financial statement readers have a good understanding of
the timing and risks related to future pension plan payments. Below is a summary of the
presentation and disclosure requirements of IAS 19.
Balance Sheet
The standard doesn’t specify whether the net defined benefit liability or asset should be
disclosed as current or non-current. In the absence of specific guidance, reasonable
judgment would suggest that these balances should usually be disclosed as non-current.
This is because it is normally unlikely that the entire amount of a pension plan obligation
would be settled within the next fiscal year, as the payments will be made for many years
in the future.
IAS 19 does not allow the netting of a defined benefit asset and a defined benefit liability
when the company has more than one pension plan, except in limited circumstances.
This is because the assets of each plan are usually protected by legislation in such a way
that they cannot be used to settle other obligations. Multiple plans may be presented as
a single line item if they are all assets or all liabilities. However, further details will be
required in the note disclosures to identify the risks of each plan.
Comprehensive Income Statement

16.7. Presentation and Disclosure

185

IAS 19 does not specify how the annual pension cost should be reported on the income
statement. Although a company could disclose the various components that make up the
pension expense separately, it is common practice to simply include a single line item
described as pension expense or similar. This amount, however, may be split between
various functions consistent with reporting of other employee expenses. Remeasurement
gains and losses included in other comprehensive income should be identified as such.
Note Disclosures
The three main disclosure categories identified in IAS 19 are:

• Explanations of the characteristics and risks of the plans
• Explanations of amounts in the financial statements
• Descriptions of how the defined benefit plans will affect the amount, timing, and
uncertainty of future cash flow

Although these categories appear fairly simple, IAS provides a significant amount of
guidance on how to meet these disclosure objectives. Some of the requirements include:

• The nature of the benefits payable under the plan
• Details of the regulatory environment under which the plan operates
• Disaggregation of financial statement amounts where risk profiles differ
• Reconciliations of opening and closing balances of plan assets and the DBO
• Disaggregation of plan assets where the risks and investment types differ
• Details of significant actuarial assumptions
• A sensitivity analysis showing the effect of changes in the actuarial assumptions
• Information about the timing of future maturities of the plan obligation

There are many other specific disclosure requirements in IAS 19 designed to help the
reader understand the possible effects of these plans on future cash flow.

16.9. Appendix A: Accounting for Post-Employment Benefits Under ASPE

187

16.9 Appendix A: Accounting for Post-Employment
Benefits Under ASPE
Prior to 2014, there were some significant differences between ASPE and IFRS with
respect to pension plan accounting. The former ASPE standard allowed the use of
a technique referred to as the deferral and amortization approach. This technique
allowed the costs of past service amendments, and other actuarial gains and losses, to
be deferred and recognized in expense over time. This approach was eliminated when
Section 34621 of the ASPE standards was issued. Section 3462 is effective for all yearends commencing on January 1, 2014, or later, and it is this standard that we will examine
in this appendix.
The approach to accounting for pensions under ASPE 3462 is similar to that of IAS
19, but there are some differences in definitions and procedures. For example, one of
the key differences is that ASPE allows for two different methods of valuing the DBO.
The company may choose to use the actuarial valuation that has been prepared for the
purposes of determining the funding levels for the plan, or the company may choose to
use a separately prepared actuarial valuation for accounting purposes. It is possible that
certain actuarial assumptions, and other factors, may differ between these two valuations.
If the company chooses to use a valuation prepared specifically for accounting purposes,
then it must choose between two approaches used for valuation of the DBO. The company may choose to use either the accumulated benefit method or the projected benefit
method. The accumulated benefit method essentially calculates the present value of
future pension payments for vested and non-vested employees using their current salary
levels. Whereas, the projected benefit method performs this calculation using future
expected salaries. Generally, the projected benefit method will result in a larger DBO.
Whichever method the company chooses, it must apply the policy consistently to all of
its pension plans. A detailed discussion of the different types of actuarial valuations is
beyond the scope of this text. They all represent variations of a present value calculation
that will normally be provided by the actuary.
Another key difference between ASPE 3462 and IAS 19 is that any remeasurement gains
or losses due to changes in actuarial assumptions, or differences between the actual
return on plan assets and the calculated return based on the appropriate interest rate,
are charged directly to the pension expense for the year, rather than being captured by
other comprehensive income.
Let’s consider our previous example using the facts presented for Ballard Ltd. in 2016:

The absence of other comprehensive income in the adjustment means that current net
income will be more volatile for companies reporting under ASPE. However, under Section
3462, companies are required to disclose the effects of any re-measurements separately,
so readers will be able to clearly see the effects of these items on net income.
Another difference between Section 3462 and IAS 19 is in the treatment of net defined
benefit assets. While IAS 19 requires the amount be reported at the lesser of the surplus amount or the asset ceiling, Section 3462 instead requires the use of a valuation
allowance. The valuation allowance essentially represents the amount of the surplus that
will not be recoverable through future reductions in contributions or withdrawals. The net
effect of this approach is essentially the same as IAS 19, but Section 3462 provides more
detailed guidance on how to calculate the amounts recoverable from the plan in the future.
Section 3462 also provides a choice of interest to use for discounting purposes. The
first option is the same as IAS 19 (i.e., the rate on high-quality debt instruments), but

Chapter Summary

189

the second option allowed is the imputed interest that would be determined if the plan
were to be settled. This option, however, should only be used in cases where the option
of immediate settlement, such as through the purchase of an annuity contract from an
insurance company, is actually available.
The treatment of defined contribution plans under Section 3462 is essentially the same as
IAS 19, although Section 3462 provides a more detailed description on how to determine
when future payments for current services are to be discounted. Additionally, Section
3462 discusses how to treat unallocated plan surpluses that could arise when a defined
benefit plan is converted to a defined contribution plan. Interest on these surpluses would
be deducted from the pension expense otherwise determined.
Section 3462 requires that an actuarial valuation of the plan be carried out at least every
three years, and more frequently if there have been any significant changes in the plan.
IAS 19 does not specify the frequency of actuarial valuations, but suggests that they
be carried out with sufficient frequency as to ensure there are no material errors in the
reported balance.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe the nature of a pension plan and identify the key
issues in accounting for a pension plan.
A pension plan is an arrangement by which employers offer benefits to employees after
the completion of their employment. Employees earn pension benefits over the course of
their employment with the company. These benefits can take many forms, but pension
plans usually involve post-employment payments made to the retired employee on a
periodic basis. The key accounting issues are: Who pays for the plan? How will the
plan’s activities be measured? How will the plan be reported?

LO 2: Define and contrast defined contribution pension plans and
defined benefit pension plans.
A defined contribution pension plan is one in which the employer has agreed to contribute
a specified amount on behalf of an employee, but has not guaranteed the amount of
retirement income the employee will receive. In contrast, a defined benefit pension plan
does specify the amount of income the employee will receive upon retirement. Under
both types of plans, it is the employers’ responsibility to make sufficient contributions
to the plans as per the agreements made with their employees. The key accounting

190

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

difference between the two plans is that a defined benefit pension plan creates a liability
for the employer to cover any shortfall of funding, based on the present value of future
expected payments, to ensure the agreed upon amount of retirement income is available
to the employee. A defined contribution pension plan, on the other hand, only creates a
liability to the extent that the company is required to make the agreed upon contributions
to the plan. The employer is not responsible for the performance of a defined contribution
pension plan, but is indirectly responsible for the performance of a defined benefit pension
plan.

LO 3: Prepare the accounting entries for a defined contribution
pension plan.
The employer records an expense every year for the amount of contributions they are
required to make. They will also record a liability if the contributions are unpaid at the end
of the year. However, as there is no guarantee of future retirement income, the company
does not record any liability beyond the amount of contributions required.

LO 4: Describe the various estimations required and elements
included in the accounting for defined benefit pension plans, and
evaluate the effects of these estimations on the accounting for these
plans.
The determination of the DBO requires estimation of several amounts. The expected
date of the employee’s retirement and the expected duration of pension payments (i.e.,
the amount of time between the employee’s retirement and death) need to be estimated.
As well, the amount of the expected pension payment will need to be predicted, as this
amount may be based on future salary levels. The interest rate used to discount the
obligation should be based on the yields on high-quality debt instruments, but there may
be subjectivity in determining which instruments to choose. Most accountants don’t have
the required training to make these kinds of estimations, so they will likely have to rely
on the work of an expert called an actuary. Because the estimates can change every
year based on new information and assumptions, it is possible that the accounting for the
pension plan may create some volatility in reported earnings, including comprehensive
income.
LO 4.1: Calculate pension expense for a defined benefit pension plan and prepare
the accounting entries for the plan.
The pension expense includes the cost of current service provided by employees, the
net interest on the scheme, and changes due to past service adjustments and other

Chapter Summary

191

amendments. The net interest represents the difference between interest calculated on
the DBO and the interest expected to be earned on the plan assets. Both calculations use
the same interest rate—the yield available on high-quality debt instruments. The pension
expense should be allocated to the various components of net income in the same fashion
as the underlying compensation costs.
The DBO is increased by the current service cost, the cost of any past service benefits granted during the year, and interest calculated on the balance. The DBO will
be decreased by any pension payments made during the year and may be increased
or decreased by any re-measurements caused by changes in actuarial assumptions.
The pension plan assets will be increased by actual returns earned on the assets and
contributions made by the employer. The pension plan assets will be decreased by any
pension payments made during the year.
Several issues are involved in the determination of the net asset or liability to be reported
on the balance sheet. First, the amount of the DBO is based on future events for which
complex actuarial calculations are required. Second, the fair value of the pension plan
assets must be determined. For many assets, this is quite straightforward, but if the
pension plan holds real estate or other assets not actively traded, expert consultations
may be required. Once the amounts are determined, the net pension liability (asset) can
be determined and reported on the balance sheet, usually as a non-current item. Other
changes in value, such as changes in actuarial assumptions used to determine the DBO
or differences between the expected and actual return on plan assets, are recorded as
part of other comprehensive income.
LO 4.2: Describe the accounting treatment of net defined benefit assets.
A net defined benefit asset represents a situation in which the plan assets exceed the
DBO. This means that the plan is overfunded. The amount of overfunding should be
reported as an asset, but only to the extent that it doesn’t exceed the asset ceiling, that
is, the present value of the future benefits available to the plan sponsor, either through
reduced contributions or cash refunds.

LO 5: Discuss the challenges in accounting for other
post-employment benefits.
Other post-employment benefits, such as supplementary health coverage, are treated in
a similar fashion as pension plans for accounting purposes. However, challenges can
arise in estimating the future payable amounts and the amount of the obligation. Future
payments for health care coverage can be very unpredictable in both the timing and the
amount. A greater degree of estimation risk may exist for these kinds of benefits as
compared to pension plans.

192

Pensions and Other Employment Benefits

LO 6: Describe the accounting treatment for other employment
benefits.
Other kinds of employment benefits may include paid vacations, sabbaticals, or sick
leave. For these kinds of benefits, it is important to understand whether they vest or not.
Benefits that vest, such as paid vacations, must be accrued and recorded by the company.
However, these benefits are not normally discounted, and any remeasurement gains or
losses that occur are recorded directly in net income instead of other comprehensive
income. For benefits that do not vest, an expense is recorded when the benefit is used,
but no amounts are accrued.

LO 7: Identify the presentation and disclosure requirements for
defined benefit pension plans.
Accrued net defined benefit amounts are normally recorded as non-current liabilities or
assets. When the company sponsors multiple pension plans, they are generally not netted
on the balance sheet. Pension expense can be shown as a single item on the income
statement or it can be split into component parts. Remeasurement amounts recorded in
other comprehensive income should be disclosed separately. There are extensive note
disclosure requirements for pension plans to help the readers understand the risks of
these plans and potential effects on future cash flow.

LO 8: Identify differences in the accounting treatment of
post-employment benefits between ASPE and IFRS.
The treatment under ASPE is similar to the treatment under IFRS, but there are some
differences. Under APSE, remeasurement amounts are reported directly in net income,
rather than in other comprehensive income. Also, companies have a choice in the method
used to measure the DBO and in the interest rate chosen to discount the obligation. If
a net defined benefit asset is reported, ASPE requires the use of a valuation allowance.
ASPE provides more detailed guidance on how to calculate some of the amounts required
to determine the DBO, but less detailed guidance on disclosure requirements. They also
require actuarial valuations every three years, whereas IFRS only requirements them with
sufficient frequency.

Leases

Leasing Versus Buying Equipment: Which is the Best Choice?
The short answer to this question is “it depends.” The question of leasing versus
buying has always been a sticking point for business management decisions because
equipment is often a high-priced item and can require the firm to pay out a lot of cash.
The following are some of the advantages and disadvantages of leasing equipment.
Leasing Advantages
• Low up-front costs and predictable payments over the lease term. Leasing
allows for a minimal initial cash payment and regular, predicable payments and
interest rate over the life of the lease, making cash flow management easier.
This is a significant consideration for new companies with a lot of competing
cash flow needs, or existing companies expanding their business market share
or product lines.
• Protects against obsolescence. Non-current assets such as equipment are
the base from which a company generates its revenue and profits. For this
reason, these assets should be monitored and kept as efficient and productive
as possible. That said, many businesses treat owned equipment as a permanent
fixture and often do not plan for major repairs or eventual replacement. As
a result, when that time comes, there may not be enough cash set aside
to address these repair or replace requirements adequately. Old equipment
often gets stretched to the limit and beyond, increasing production downtime
and negatively impacting revenue and profits. Often the additional costs to
operate and repair old and outdated equipment outweighs any interest costs
incurred for leasing new equipment that would maximize efficient production
costs, generating more revenue and profits.
• New technology improves productivity. The lower entry cash requirements
and the option to dispose of the equipment at the end of the lease term enable
businesses to employ the most advanced technology within their industry sector.
This gives them an edge over their competitors in terms of better productivity,
more competitive pricing, and potentially employing fewer people. Leasing also
enables businesses more flexibility so they can change equipment more quickly
in response to changing environments and customer needs.
• Tax benefits. Operating leases are recorded as an operating expense, so they
are tax deductible. They are therefore not reported as a liability on the balance
199

200

Leases

sheet (referred to as off-balance sheet financing). This means that operating
leases will not usually negatively affect the company’s liquidity and solvency
ratios or significantly impact any restrictive covenants from other creditors.
Leasing Disadvantages
• Higher ownership costs. Leased equipment is generally new, which tends to
depreciate the most in the early years.
• No accumulated equity. Depending on the type of lease, businesses will never
have title or ownership, so there is no equity to accumulate.
• Lease payments always exist. If a business is seasonal, there may be
slow cycles throughout the year where the equipment is idle. Under a lease
agreement, cash payments continue, which could put a strain on a business
going through a slow cycle or downturn. Also, with leasing agreements,
negotiations are necessary, and businesses are subsequently tied to the specific
lease term.
• Scheduled maintenance and repair costs. Many leasing agreements include
a structured repair and maintenance schedule that must be followed by the
lessee. With equipment ownership, the business can make its own decisions
about when maintenance is required.

Introduction
This chapter will focus on the basics of leasing agreements. Leases can be classified as either an operating lease, like a simple rental agreement, or a finance/capital
(IFRS/ASPE) lease, where the leased item is classified as an asset with a corresponding
liability (even if the legal title has not transferred to the lessee). The accounting standards
focus on the economic substance rather than on the legal form. Leases will be discussed
in terms of their use in business, their recognition, measurement, reporting and analysis.
Leases will also be discussed and illustrated from both the viewpoint of the company
leasing from another party (lessee), and the company leasing to another party (lessor).

17.1 Leases: Overview
Businesses often need to update their existing equipment or business space, or perhaps
acquire entirely new equipment or accommodation as they expand their operations. The
opening story describes the pros and cons of leasing assets versus buying them. As
demonstrated, the answer isn’t straightforward and requires an analysis of the business
on a case-by-case basis to determine whether buying or leasing is the best option. This
chapter will focus on a business’s decision to lease equipment and the accounting treatment that is required as a result.
Leasing is simply defined as the temporary right to use an asset for a specified period
of time in exchange for cash payments or other consideration. This definition is broad
and includes common transactions, such as leasing an apartment from a landlord or
leasing a car from a dealership. In the case of a private individual, these types of
leases are generally treated as rental agreements and a rental expense. In the case of
businesses entering into leasing agreements, such as renting office space or equipment,
the accounting treatment is more complex. It depends on the economic substance of the
transaction and how closely the transaction meets certain prescribed criteria set out in
the ASPE and IFRS accounting standards. In some cases, an operating lease is used,
which is a simple rental agreement where payments made are recorded to rental expense.
In other cases, it will be classified as a capital lease where the business would report
the leased asset in the balance sheet, along with an associated lease obligation as a
liability. The main focus of this chapter will be the difference between the classification of
a lease as an operating lease or a capital (ASPE)/finance (IFRS) lease and the accounting
treatment that follows.

17.2 Classification Criteria for Capitalization
For all businesses to comply with the accounting standards, lease agreements must be
classified as either an operating lease or as a capital (ASPE)/finance (IFRS) lease. Each
accounting standard has set its own criteria to determine the classification and is based
on who substantively bears the risks and rewards of ownership.
Before getting into the details regarding the accounting treatment under IFRS (IAS 17), be
aware that there is a new IFRS standard, IFRS 16, that will be replacing IAS 17 effective
January 1, 2019, (with early adoption, if companies prefer). If IFRS 16 goes ahead as
planned, the impact will result in all asset-based leases being capitalized with only two
exceptions; low $-value, and short-term leases of 12 months or less. These can continue
to be treated as operating leases. This means that many of the leases currently accounted
for as operating leases, will change to a capitalized lease that will record the leased
asset and the leased obligation (liability). The basis of the new IFRS 16 standard is

17.2. Classification Criteria for Capitalization

203

significantly changing from IAS 17’s classification approach to a contract-based approach
that views asset-based leases as “right-of-use” assets where the lessor gives the lessee
the right to use the leased asset in exchange for periodic payments over the lease term.
These payments represent a contractual obligation to the lessee. For the lessee, this
means recognition of a leased asset and a lease obligation, which will effectively curtail
the much-sought after “off-balance sheet financing” option through an operating lease
with rental payments only. For lessors, the accounting treatment will be the same as
IAS 17. Currently, IFRS 16 is a choice through early adoption, while IAS 17 is currently
the mandatory standard. For this reason, the rest of this chapter will follow the IAS 17
accounting standard currently in place.

Lessee Classification
Below is a recap of the criteria needed for the lessee classification for a capital/finance
lease:
ASPE
The criteria are much more prescriptive
than with IFRS (IAS 17).

IFRS (IAS 17)
More professional judgment is needed
since the criteria below are qualitative
and do not include numeric thresholds.

The ASPE criteria requires the lessee to
classify the lease as a capital lease if any
one or more of the following criteria is
met:
1. There is either a transfer of ownership
or a bargain purchase option (BPO)
included in the lease agreement. If a BPO
exists, it is assumed that the lessee will
exercise the right to purchase the asset at
the BPO price because this price is
significantly lower than the asset’s fair
value at that time.
2. The lease term, which includes any
bargain renewal option, covers most of
the leased asset’s economic life. It is
assumed that the lessee will exercise the
right to extend the agreement at the
bargain renewal price because this price
is significantly lower than market at that
time. The threshold calculation is: Lease
term must be at least 75% of the asset’s
estimated economic or useful life.

Any one or more of the criteria below
supports the classification as a finance
lease:
1. Same as ASPE.

2. The lease term will make up the major
part of the estimated useful life of the
lease asset. If a bargain renewal option
was included in the lease agreement, it is
assumed that the lessee will exercise the
right to extend the agreement at the
bargain renewal price because this price
is significantly lower than market at that
time.

204

Leases

3. The lessor will recover substantially all
of the leased asset’s fair value as well as
realizing a return on the investment. The
lessee is in substance purchasing the
asset. The threshold calculation is the
present value of the sum of:
• the lease payments (excluding any
executory, maintenance, or contingent
costs paid by the lessee that are
included in the lease payment);
• a guaranteed residual value; or
• a bargain purchase option that is equal
to 90% or more of the fair value of the
leased asset.
This sum is referred to as the minimum
lease payment.1 The interest rate used
in the present value calculation is the
lower of the lessor’s implicit rate if known,
or the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate.
4.

5.

3. The lessor will recover substantially all
of the leased asset’s fair value as well as
realizing a return on the investment. The
lessee is, in substance, purchasing the
asset. This is substantiated if the present
value of the minimum lease payment* is
substantially all of the fair value of the
leased asset. The interest rate used for
the present value calculation is the
lessor’s implicit rate, unless it cannot be
reasonably determined, in which case the
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate will
be used instead.

4. The leased assets are so specialized
that they will only benefit the lessee
without major modifications.
5. The lessee reimburses the lessor for
any losses if the lessee cancels the lease.

For points 2 and 3 above, note that even though the leased asset’s title has not legally
transferred to the lessee, the risks and rewards of ownership have been substantially
transferred to the lessee, hence the accounting treatment to capitalize the lease. This
is an example of a case in which the economic substance, rather than the legal form,
dictates the accounting treatment.
Note: For both standards, the leased asset valuation amount cannot exceed its fair value
at that date.

1

The lessee’s minimum lease payments are essentially all the payments that the lessee is required to
make over the lease term, which includes any guaranteed residual value and any BPO or bargain renewal
option, but excludes any executory, maintenance, or contingent costs that are included in the lease payment.
A contingent cost might be additional lease payments required to be paid that are based on subsequent
events, such as if the lessee’s sales exceed a certain threshold amount during the lease term.

17.2. Classification Criteria for Capitalization

205

Lessor Classification
For the lessor classification as a capital lease, ASPE requires any one of the three ASPE
criteria for the lessee above to be met, plus two additional criteria:

1. Collectability of the lease payments is reasonably predictable.
2. There are no important uncertainties about costs that have not yet been incurred by
the lessor.

If the above two additional criteria are not met, it would not be appropriate for the lessor
to remove the leased asset from its accounting records. On the rare occasions where this
is the case, it would require special accounting treatment, which is beyond the scope of
this textbook.
Further analysis is required to determine if the lease is a sales-type lease, indicated by
the existence of a profit, or is a direct-financing lease, where no sales and cost of goods
sold are involved (which is usually the case when lessors are finance companies or banks
and not manufacturers or dealers).
For the lessor classification to be a capital lease, IFRS (IAS 17) indicators include the five
IFRS qualitative criteria above. Professional judgment is applied to these to determine
if classification as a finance lease is appropriate. Usually, if any one of the first three
qualitative criteria above is met, it is likely to be classified as a finance lease. Similar to
ASPE, if the lessor is a dealer or manufacturer the accounting entries will include sales
and cost of goods sold accounts and amounts, whereas for a finance company or bank,
the entries will be recorded to a lease receivable with interest earned on the receivable.
If the lease is deemed to be a capital/finance lease, the lessee records the leased asset
and the corresponding lease obligation as though it was a purchase subject to depreciation with payments and interest on an instalment loan. The lessor derecognizes the leased
asset by removing it from its leased assets inventory and records a receivable amount
equal to the sum of the lease payments, the residual value, or the bargain purchase
option. The lessor must also record the lease as either a sale, if the present value of the
lease is greater than the cost of goods sold (a profit), or as a financing arrangement (no
profit). This will be illustrated shortly.

Special Items
Indirect costs. Indirect costs arise if the lessor is not a manufacturer or dealer. Any initial
direct costs of negotiating and arranging the lease are included in the investment amount

206

Leases

to be recovered when calculating the lease payment. Recall that the lease payment is
determined by the lessor to recover all costs.
Economic life versus lease term. The economic life of an asset is usually longer than the
lease term. Depreciation of a leased asset by the lessee for a capitalized lease is based
on whether the title of the leased asset transfers to the lessee. If the legal title remains
with the lessor, and the leased equipment is returned to the lessor at the end of the lease
term, the depreciation period of the leased asset will be the lease term. If the legal title to
the leased asset transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or there is a bargain
purchase or bargain renewal option, it is assumed that the lessee will exercise this option
since the price of either a BPO or a bargain renewal option is significantly lower than the
market price at that time. For this reason, a leased asset under these circumstances will
be depreciated over its economic or useful life instead of over the lease term. This makes
intuitive sense, given that the lessee intends to continue to use the asset beyond the lease
term.
Interest rates. As previously stated, the lessor’s implicit interest rate is to be used in the
present value calculation since it is usually the more realistic rate for IFRS. Alternatively,
the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used if the lessee does not know the lessor’s
implicit rate. ASPE advocates the lower of either the lessor’s implicit rate (if known) or the
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. This is to ensure that an artificially high interest rate
is not used. Recall from previous chapters regarding long-term debt that the higher the
interest rate, the lower the present value of the debt obligation. In leasing terms, using
an unrealistically high interest rate could reduce the present value of the lease to below
the capitalization threshold criterion (90% for ASPE, and “substantially all” for IFRS (IAS
17)), thus avoiding a capitalization classification with its requirement to report a lease
asset and obligation. Once an interest rate is selected, the accrued interest for the lessee
and interest income for the lessor are calculated using the effective interest method as
discussed in the long-term debt chapter.
Executory costs. Lease payments often include leased asset use costs that the lessor
has paid and wants to recoup from the lessee, such as insurance, maintenance, licenses,
or tax costs. These executory costs are to be excluded when calculating the present
value of the lease and separately recorded as an expense, as they don’t arise from the
acquisition of the leased asset, but rather from its use. For example, if the lease payment
of $14,000 included $2,000 for insurance of the leased asset, the lessee’s journal entry
would be:

Operating Lease. If the criteria identified above for either ASPE or IFRS (IAS 17) are
not met, the lease would be treated as an operating lease and the subsequent entries

classified as an operating lease, the entries are as follows:

Note: No entries are made by the lessee to classify a leased asset or to recognize a lease
obligation. No obligation means that the lessee can use the leased asset exclusively without any impact on its liquidity, coverage, or debt ratios. Classification as an operating lease
in this instance is an example of off-balance sheet financing. The avoidance of reporting
debt can motivate manufacturers and lessee businesses to play with the numbers to stay
under the ASPE capitalization criteria, enabling management to classify the lease as an
operating lease and avoid reporting an additional liability for the lease obligation. This
allows a business to report operations in the best light, even though from an economic
standpoint the results reported to shareholders and creditors do not reflect the economic
reality. Whereas, since IFRS (IAS 17) considers the substance of the transaction rather
than simply using hard thresholds, it may be more difficult under IFRS for management to
manipulate the numbers.

Example 1: Sales-type lease for the lessor
The accounting treatment is best explained using a numeric example. On January 1,
2016, Tweenix Corp. (lessee) entered into an agreement to lease a piece of landscaping
equipment from Morganette Ltd. (lessor). The lease details are below:

Other information:

• Both companies’ year-ends are December 31, and both follow ASPE.
• Collectability of the lease payments is reasonably predictable and there are no
important uncertainties about costs that have not yet been incurred by the lessor.
• The lessee depreciates all equipment on a straight-line basis.

Accounting Treatment – Summary of the Steps
1. Lease terms determined by the lessor include the lease payment amount, the length
of the lease, the interest (discount) rate, the bargain purchase option or bargain
renewal option (if any), and the residual value as either guaranteed or unguaranteed
by the lessee. These terms may be subject to some negotiation between the lessee
and lessor, but the lease payment amount is calculated from the lessor’s point of
view.

For both the lessee and lessor:

2. Once the lease terms are known, analysis and classification of the lease as either
an operating or capital (ASPE)/finance (IFRS ,IAS 17) lease is required.
3. Record initial entry(ies) to recognize and valuate the lease.
4. Record lease payment entry(ies) throughout the reporting periods over the lease
term.

17.3. Accounting Treatment for Capitalized Leases

209

5. Record adjusting entries, if any, at each reporting date over the lease term.
6. Report the results. Typically, it will be the balance sheet for the lessee and the
income statement for the lessor.
7. Record the final entry at the end of the lease term.

Each of the steps above is now considered and journal entry accounts and amounts
determined.

Applying the Steps:
Step 1. Lease terms determined by the lessor include the lease payment amount,
the length of the lease, the interest (discount) rate, the bargain purchase option
or bargain renewal option (if any), and the residual value whether guaranteed or
unguaranteed by the lessee:
In this case, the lessor wants to get a return of 7% on the investment. Other negotiated
details between the lessor and lessee result in a lease term of eight years, no bargain
purchase or bargain renewal options, and the lease will revert back to lessor at the end
of the lease term. The lessee does not guarantee the residual value of the equipment
at the end of the lease term in this case. The equipment originally cost $666,000 and
has a current fair value of $864,000. On this basis, the lessor must now calculate the
lease payment amount that the lessee will pay at the beginning of each year. For this
reason, the payment calculation using present values and a financial calculator will be for
an annuity due (AD). This simply means that, in this example, the lease payment is to
be made at the beginning of each year instead of at the end. The annuity due concept
was discussed in further detail in the chapter on long-term debt under present values and
timelines.
The lessor must also calculate the lease payment amount on a present value basis.
The data that the lessor must use to calculate the lease payment amount is the 7%
expected rate of return (I/Y), the $864,000 current fair value as the present value (PV)
of the equipment, the eight years duration of the arrangement (N), and the $36,000
unguaranteed residual value (FV) that the lessor hopes to receive by reselling the used
equipment in the marketplace at the end of the lease term.
Note that when calculating the lease payment, it does not matter if the residual value is
guaranteed or not guaranteed by the lessee because the residual value represents a cash
flow in, no matter the source. Recall that the lease payment calculation is from the lessor’s
point of view. However, whether the residual value is guaranteed or not by the lessee
does matter for the lessee present value calculation of the minimum lease payments as

210

Leases

shown below in step 2. In the meantime, the present value calculation, using a financial
calculator, for an annuity due is:

PV = (PMT/AD, I/Y, N, FV)
or
PMT/AD = (+/- PV, I/Y, N, FV)
PMT/AD = (+/- 864,000 PV, 7 I/Y, 8 N, 36,000 FV)
PMT/AD = $131,947.0162
or $131,947 due at the beginning of each year (annuity due)

The lease payment will be $131,947 per year for eight years for the lessor to recoup the
asset’s fair value of $864,000, earn a 7% return, and recoup a residual value of $36,000
from the marketplace at the end of eight years. The unguaranteed residual value that the
lessor expects to receive once the leased asset is sold in the marketplace at the end of
the lease term causes the lease payment amount for the lessee to be reduced. Had there
been no residual value, the lessee’s lease payment amount would be the higher amount
of $135,226 (+/- 864,000 PV, 7 I/Y, 8 N, 0 FV).
Valuation of the lessee’s lease obligation, and the corresponding leased asset, is based
on calculating the present value of the estimated net cash flows, same as was done for
other long-term debt in a previous chapter. In the case of leasing, these estimated net
cash flows are referred to as the minimum lease payments from the lessee’s point of
view. This will be included below in step 2. The important thing to remember is that the
valuation of the lessee’s asset and associated obligation must be the lower of the present
value of the minimum lease payments and the fair value of the leased asset at the time of
the lease agreement.
Step 2. Analysis and classification of the lease as an operating or capital lease:
The terms of the lease agreement are now set, and it is time to determine whether the
lease is to be classified as an operating or capital lease by both parties. Since these
companies follow ASPE, this will be the criterion used.
Lessee Analysis
At least one of the four criteria below must be met for the lease to be classified as capital,
otherwise it will be classified as operating. Below, highlighted in red, are the results of the
analysis for this example:

• Does ownership title pass? No, title remains with the lessor.

17.3. Accounting Treatment for Capitalized Leases

211

• Is there a BPO or a bargain renewal option? No
• Is the lease term at least 75% of the asset’s estimated economic or useful life? Yes,
capitalize leased asset.
8 years ÷ 9 years = 89% which is greater than 75%
Note: At this point, as one of the criteria has been met, the capitalization of the lease is
now applicable, but the lessee analysis will continue for illustrative purposes.
• Is the present value of the minimum lease payment (net cash flows) at least 90% of
the fair value of the leased asset? Yes, as calculated below.

The lease cash flows = $131,947 lease payment
+ $0 guaranteed residual value
+ $0 BPO
− $0 executory costs paid by lessee included in
the $131,947 lease payment
Discounted at the lowest of either the lessor’s implicit rate (7%) or the lessee’s incremental
borrowing rate (8%).
Present value calculation:

PV = (PMT/AD, I/Y, N, FV)
PV = (131,947 PMT/AD, 7 I/Y, 8 N, 0 FV*)

*As residual value is not guaranteed by the lessee, it is not included in the lessee’s present value calculation.

Using a financial calculator, the present value of the leased asset is calculated as:

PV = $843,047.5687 or $843,048 rounded
If the fair value of the leased asset is $864,000, the present value of the net cash flows is
97.575% and is, therefore, greater than the threshold criterion of 90%. The leased asset

212

Leases

and the associated lease obligation will be the amount of the present value of the lessee’s
minimum lease payments of $843,048.
Note: Had the present value yielded a higher amount, the maximum valuation for the
lease asset and obligation would be the fair value amount of $864,000.
For the lessee, the analysis reveals that this lease meets two of the criteria for capitalization. Since only one criterion needs to be met, the lessee will classify this lease as a
capital lease.
Lessor Analysis
The criteria above are also used to determine if the lease is to be a capital/finance lease
for the lessor, plus two additional criteria:
• Collectability of the lease payments is reasonably predictable. Yes
• There are no important uncertainties about the un-reimbursable costs yet to be
incurred by the lessor. Yes
The lessor must now determine if the lease is to be treated as a sales-type lease or a
direct-financing lease under ASPE (note that with IFRS (IAS 17), the lease is either a
manufacturer/dealer lease or a finance lease). In this case, the fair value of the lease of
$864,000 exceeds the lessor’s cost of $666,000, meaning that a profit exists that classifies
it as a sales-type lease treatment. If the lessor were not a manufacturer or dealer, such
as if the lessor was a finance company, the lease would be treated as a direct-financing
lease.
To summarize the analyses above, if the lease meets the criteria for capitalization for
the lessee, it will also be classified as a capital lease for the lessor, unless there are
collectability issues or uncertainties about un-reimbursable costs as identified above.
Once the capitalization of the lease classification is determined for both the lessee and
the lessor, further analysis is necessary to determine if the lease is to be treated as either
a sales-type or direct-financing lease (ASPE) for the lessor.
As a capital lease, the lessee records the leased asset and the corresponding lease
obligation based on the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or
the leased asset’s fair value at that time. The payments made to the lessor are recorded
as a reduction in the lease obligation. At year-end, the leased asset is depreciated, and
accrued interest expense of the leased obligation is recorded.
As a sales-type lease, the lessor recorded the lease receivable, the sales revenue, and
the unearned interest income that will be realized over the lease term. The leased
asset is transferred from the leased assets inventory to cost of goods sold. Any lease

17.3. Accounting Treatment for Capitalized Leases

payments received are recorded as a reduction of the lease receivable. At year-end,
the interest earned for the year is reclassified from unearned interest income to earned
interest income.

Step 7. Record the final entry at the end of the lease term:
At the end of the lease term, the leased asset is returned to the lessor. The lessee’s
accounting records will show that the leased asset will now be fully depreciated, and the
lease obligation will have a zero-balance owing. If the residual value of $36,000 is equal
to the fair value at that time, the final entries for the lessee and lessor at the end of the
lease term would be:

Note the differences in the journal entries for the non-guaranteed residual value compared
to the guaranteed residual value highlighted in red.
What if the lessor included a bargain purchase option (BPO) that is clearly less than its
fair value at the end of the lease? In that case, it is assumed that the lessee will exercise
the right to purchase the leased asset at the end of the lease term for the BPO price. The
leased asset will no longer revert back to the lessor and the residual value will apply now
to the lessee and not to the lessor. Since title to the asset will transfer to the lessee, the
asset will be depreciated over its economic life instead of the lease term.
For simplicity, the fair value of $864,000 will remain the same. The lease payment amount
calculated by the lessor will be adjusted to include a BPO of $20,000 in place of the
residual value:
PMT/AD = (+/- 864,000 PV, 7 I/Y, 8 N, 20,000 FV)
= $133,404 due at the beginning of each year (annuity due)
The lease payment must, therefore, be $133,404 per year for eight years so that the lessor
can recoup the asset’s fair value of $864,000, earn a 7% return, and receive a bargain
payment option from the lessee of $20,000 at the end of eight years.
The entries assuming a BPO of $20,000 are shown below. Assume for purposes of
depreciation that the asset will have a residual value of $31,500 at the end of its useful
life.

Example 2: Direct-financing lease for the lessor
On May 31, 2016, Visuel Ltd. (lessee) leases its equipment from First Finance Corporation
(lessor). The lease has the following terms:
Non-cancellable lease term
Lease bargain renewal option or a bargain purchase option
Residual value (guaranteed by lessee)
Annual lease payment due each May 31 (annuity due)
Equipment estimated economic life
Equipment fair value on May 31, 2016
Lessor has set the following implicit rate of return, which is
known to lessee
Lessee incremental borrowing rate

5 years
None – equipment
reverts back to lessor
$19,652
$41,400
6 years
$203,600
5%
6%

Other information:

• Both companies’ year-ends are December 31 and both follow ASPE.
• Collectability of the lease payments is reasonably predictable and there are no
important uncertainties about costs that have not yet been incurred by the lessor.
• The lessee depreciates all equipment on a straight-line basis.

17.3. Accounting Treatment for Capitalized Leases

221

Applying the Steps:
Step 1. Lease terms determined by the lessor include the lease payment amount,
the length of the lease, the interest (discount) rate, the bargain purchase option
or bargain renewal option, if any, and the residual value as either guaranteed or
unguaranteed by the lessee. These terms may be subject to some negotiation
between the lessee and lessor:
In this case, the lease payment of $41,400 is already calculated. All other terms are
known.
Step 2. Analysis and classification of the lease as an operating or capital lease:
The terms of the lease agreement are set, and it is time to determine whether the lease is
to be classified as an operating or capital lease by both parties. Since these companies
follow ASPE, these will be the criteria used.
Lessee Analysis
At least one of the four criteria below must be met for the lease to be classified as a capital
lease, otherwise it will be classified as an operating lease:

• Does ownership title pass? No, title remains with the lessor.
• Is there a BPO or a bargain renewal option? No.
• Is the lease term at least 75% of the asset’s estimated economic or useful life? Yes,
capitalize leased asset.
5 years ÷ 6 years = 83% which is greater than 75%
Note: At this point, since at least one of the above criteria has been met, the capitalization
of the lease is now applicable. However, the lessee analysis will continue for illustrative
purposes.

• Is the present value of the minimum lease payment (net cash flows) at least 90% of
the fair value of the leased asset? Yes, as calculated below.
Present value calculation:
PV = (41,400 PMT/AD, 5 I/Y*, 5 N, 19,652 FV**)
* Recall that the ASPE standards state that the lower of the two interest rates is to be used since
both are known to the lessee. In this case, 5% is the lower of the two interest rates.

222

Leases

** Residual value is guaranteed by the lessee, so it is included in the lessee’s present value calculation.

Using a financial calculator, the present value of the leased asset is calculated as:
PV = $203,600 rounded
If the fair value of the leased asset is $203,600, the present value of the net cash
flows is 100% and is, therefore, greater than the threshold of 90%.

For the lessee, this analysis reveals that the lease meets two of the criteria for capitalization. Since only one criterion needs to be met, this lease can be classified as a capital
lease by the lessee.
Lessor Analysis
The lease will be a capital lease to the lessor provided that:

• Collectability of the lease payments is reasonably predictable. Yes
• There are no important uncertainties about the un-reimbursable costs yet to be
incurred by the lessor. Yes

To determine type of lease, as the cost to the lessor is the same as the fair value (i.e.,
there is no profit), and as First Finance Corporation is not a manufacturer or dealer, the
lease is classified as a direct-financing lease for the lessor.
To summarize, if the lease meets the criteria for capitalization for the lessee, it will also be
classified as a capital transaction for the lessor, since there are no collectability issues or
uncertainties about un-reimbursable costs.
Further analysis determines that this is to be treated as a direct-financing lease under
ASPE (IFRS (IAS 17): finance lease).
As a direct-financing capital lease, the lessor removes the leased asset from the leased
asset account and records the lease as receivable. The difference is recorded to unearned interest income, which will be earned over the lease term. Any lease payments
received are recorded as a reduction of the lease receivable. At year-end, the portion of
the interest earned for the current fiscal year is reclassified from unearned interest income
to earned interest income.
These entries are recorded below.

17.4 Sales and Leaseback Transactions
A sales and leaseback transaction occurs when an asset is sold to the buyer, and is
immediately leased back from the buyer. The seller becomes the lessee, and the buyer
becomes the lessor. This is common in situations where the seller/lessee needs to
generate cash. They can obtain the cash they need through the sale of the asset, but, as
they need to continue using it, they lease it back right away. This represents a bundled
transaction (sale/lease) between two parties. Typically, gains on sale and leaseback
transactions that are classified as a finance lease are to be deferred and amortized. For
a finance lease, the amortization of the deferred gain/loss uses the same basis as the
depreciation policy of the lessee.
For example, on January 1, Langmeyer Ltd. owns an office building, which it sells to Bagel
Ltd. for $20 million, which is the fair value on that date. It is immediately leased back to
Langmeyer Ltd. for a 25-year term, which is equal to the office’s remaining useful life. At
the time of the sale, the asset had a cost of $5 million and accumulated depreciation of
$4 million. The purchaser/lessor wants to obtain an 8% return on the lease, so the lease
payments would be:

226

Leases

PMT/AD = (+/- PV, I/Y, N, FV)
PMT/AD = (+/- 20,000,000 PV, 8 I/Y, 25 N, 0 FV)
PMT/AD = $1,734,792 due at the beginning of each year (annuity due)
Since the lease term is 25 years, which is equal to the remaining useful life of the
asset, it meets the criteria necessary to be classified as a finance lease for the lessee.
Collectability is assured, and there are no important uncertainties for the lessor, making it
a finance lease for the lessor as well. The year-end for both companies is December 31,
and both follow IFRS (IAS 17).
The first entry for this transaction will be for the sale, where the removal of the asset and
its related accumulated depreciation is recorded along with a deferred gain/loss. For the
buyer, it is simply a purchase of an asset for cash. The remaining entries will be for the
lease agreement, as previously illustrated earlier in this chapter. The only change is that,
for the lessee, there will be an additional entry for the amortization of a portion of the
deferred gain.

Recall that the amortization for the deferred gain used the same basis (25 years) as
the depreciation policy of the company. Also, note that the realized gain of $760,000 is
credited to depreciation expense as a reduction to this operating expense.

As leases tend to be long-term commitments, it is important to disclose information about
the leased asset, lease obligation, and leased receivables. Below is a summary of some
of the main IFRS (IAS 17) disclosures. Note that ASPE disclosures are similar but more
simplified.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe leases and their role in accounting and business.
A lease is one method of financing the use of an asset. For example, when businesses
want to update their equipment or expand their operations, they might lease rather than
buy. A lease will provide the company with a temporary right to use an asset, over a
specified period of time, in exchange for some other consideration, usually cash. Leases

230

Leases

can be classified as either an operating lease or capitalized as a capital/finance lease,
depending on whether the transaction meets the ASPE or IFRS (IAS 17) criteria, which
look at the economic substance of a lease rather than its legal form. An operating lease
is recorded to rental expense for the lessee, and recorded to rental income for the lessor.
A capitalized lease is recorded to an asset and a related obligation for the lessee, and to
lease receivable as either a sale or as a financing agreement like an instalment loan.

LO 2: Describe the criteria used for ASPE and IFRS (IAS 17) to
classify a lease as a capital/finance lease.
While ASPE criteria are more prescriptive and contain numerical thresholds, IFRS (IAS
17) criteria are more qualitative and require more professional judgment. For ASPE, three
criteria are required for capitalization classification for the lessee to occur. If any one of
the following are met, classification as a capital lease is required. First, if legal ownership
passes, or substantively passes, through the existence of a bargain purchase option or
bargain renewal option. Second, if the lease term is at least 75% of the asset’s estimated
economic or useful life. Third, if the present value of the minimum lease payments is
equal to 90% or more of the fair value of the asset at that time. In the case of the lessor,
the same three criteria are considered, plus two additional criteria involving collectability
of lease payments and no uncertainties regarding lessor costs. If any one of the three
criteria and both of the additional uncertainty and collectability criteria are met, the lessor
is required to classify the lease as a capital lease. Additional analysis is required to
determine if the capital lease for the lessor is a sales-type lease, where there is a profit,
or a direct-financing lease for banks or finance companies.
In the case of IFRS (IAS 17), the lessee analysis uses the same three criteria as was
stated for ASPE, but without the numeric thresholds. Furthermore, there are two additional indicators, involving specialized equipment and reimbursements of losses to the
lessor, that could sway the classification in favour of a finance lease. If the lessor is a
dealer or manufacturer, the entries will include sales and cost of goods sold, otherwise
the lease will be treated as a financing lease if the lessor is a bank or financing company.
If the lease does not meet the criteria for capitalization, it is treated as an operating lease
with lease payments recorded as rent expense for the lessee and rent revenue for the
lessor.

Chapter Summary

231

LO 3: Prepare the accounting entries of a capitalized lease for both
the lessee and lessor.
The accounting treatment for capitalized leases follows certain steps. These steps dictate
the types and timing of the entries throughout the lease term for both the lessee and
lessor. If the lease is capitalized, the lessee records a leased asset and a related lease
obligation, including lease payments, depreciation, and accrued interest on the debt. The
lessor removes the asset from their inventory and records either a sale or a financing
lease. Additionally, lease payments reduce the amount of the lessor’s lease receivable
and interest is earned over the lease term. The effective interest method is applied to
calculate the interest component of the lease obligation. Special items, such as economic
life versus the lease term, and the lessor’s implicit interest rate versus the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate, can affect some of the lessee and lessor accounting entries. This
chapter presents several examples from the perspectives of the lessee and the lessor,
including unguaranteed and guaranteed residual values, a bargain purchase option, and
a direct-finance lease.

LO 4: Prepare the accounting entries of a capitalized sale and
leaseback transaction.
Another form of financing involves a sale and a leaseback. This is when a seller sells
an asset and immediately leases it back from the buyer. The seller becomes the lessee
and the buyer becomes the lessor. Since this transaction is actually a bundled sale/lease
transaction, care must be taken to ensure that both parties do not try to manipulate the
numbers unrealistically. For this reason, capitalized sale and leaseback transactions typically defer and amortize the gains/losses, usually on the same basis as the depreciation
policy.

LO 5: Explain how leases are disclosed in the financial statements.
As leases are usually long-term commitments, disclosures must be in-depth enough to
provide shareholders and creditors with adequate information to assess liquidity and
solvency. The disclosures for ASPE and IFRS are similar, although IAS 17 also requires
additional disclosures for various classes of leases and reconciliations that assist financial
statement readers to assess the amount of interest cost included in the minimum lease
payments. As is the case with other long-term financial instruments, both the lease
obligation and the lease receivable are separated into current and long-term balances
in the balance sheet/SFP.

232

Leases

LO 6: Explain the similarities and differences between ASPE and
IFRS regarding capitalization criteria, interest rates, and disclosures.
ASPE capitalization criteria contain numeric thresholds, making it much more prescriptive
than IFRS (IAS 17). As IFRS (IAS 17) does not have the numeric thresholds, professional
judgment is needed to determine if capitalization is required. For the lessor, both ASPE
and IFRS have similar accounting treatments for either a lease that includes a profit
element (sales and cost of goods sold), or as a finance lease, with an interest component
only. In some cases, the interest rate used when calculating the present value of the
minimum lease payments can differ between ASPE and IFRS. While the disclosures for
both standards are similar, IFRS does require some additional disclosures to be made.

Shareholders’ Equity

Google This!
On April 2, 2014, Google Inc. paid its shareholders a share dividend, an event that was
later described as the “1,998 for 1,000 stock split.” For every 1,000 shares that were
held prior to the split, an additional 998 shares were issued. This essentially doubled
the number of outstanding shares and caused the share price to fall to approximately
half of its pre-split price, which had been hovering above $1,000 per share. This
technique is called a stock split and is commonly used by companies to lower a share
price when it starts rising to levels that are unaffordable for the average investor.
Although Google’s share price certainly justified a stock split, the unique structure of
this split suggests other motivations as well. Prior to the split, Google Inc. had two
classes of shares: Class A, which carried one vote each and were publicly traded,
and Class B, which carried ten votes each and were not publicly traded (held mostly
by the company’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin). Because of the supervoting rights of their Class B shares, the founders were able to maintain control of
the company. However, as many Class A shares were issued over the years to
acquire new businesses or to reward employee performance, the founders’ share of
the ownership became diluted.
When the split occurred, in 2014, Google took the unusual step of creating a new
class of shares, Class C, to distribute to existing Class A shareholders. However,
the new Class C shares did not carry any voting rights. The Class A shareholders
immediately objected to this arrangement, as they felt that these new shares would not
be as valuable as the existing shares because they lacked voting rights. The company
argued that, because the founders already controlled the majority of the shares, the
voting rights of the Class A shares were of no significant value. In response, the
shareholders launched a class action lawsuit, which was eventually settled when the
company agreed to pay compensation to the existing Class A shareholders if, after
one year, the Class C shares were trading at a discount of more than 1%, as compared
to the Class A shares. On April 3, 2015, the Class A shares were trading at $542.08
per share and the Class C shares were trading at $535.76, a difference of 1.2%.
Apparently, the market did attach some value to minority voting rights. Google agreed
to pay an “adjustment payment” of $522 million to Class A shareholders in May 2015.
As demonstrated in this example, the rights of shareholders can create complicated
legal issues. The right to vote and the right to receive dividends are the two essential
elements that shareholders have in order to protect their investment. Proper and

Introduction
The Conceptual Framework provides a deceptively simple definition for equity: “the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities” (CPA Canada, 2016,
Part I, The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, 4.4 (c)). This definition confirms the most elementary principle in accounting, which is embodied in the accounting
equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This apparent conceptual simplicity is further
confirmed by the fact that IFRS does not actually contain a separate handbook section
devoted to shareholders’ equity. However, despite this lack of structured guidance, we
should not define equity as a simple concept that doesn’t require much attention. On the
contrary, there are a number of ways in which the accounting, presentation, and disclosure
of equity transactions can be quite complex. Although equity is the residual interest

Chapter Organization

241

of the business’s owners, it is not simply a plug figure used to balance the accounting
equation. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the complexities in accounting for equity
transactions and we will look at the presentation and disclosure requirements for what
can be legally complicated instruments.

18.1 What is Equity?
Despite the simple definition initially provided, the Conceptual Framework does expand on
the concept of equity by explaining that funds contributed by shareholders, retained earnings, and other reserves may require separate disclosures. The reasons given for a more
detailed disclosure include the objective of providing information about legal restrictions
on the distribution of equity that may be useful to investors for decision-making purposes,
and the need to disclose the different legal rights that may attach to the various types of
equity interests. The Conceptual Framework also notes that although, by definition, equity
is affected by the measurement of assets and liabilities, the amount of equity reported

242

Shareholders’ Equity

would only coincidentally be equal to the current market value of a company. This is an
important point, as it highlights one of the limitations of financial reporting: that financial
statements by themselves cannot tell an investor what a company is worth.
The components of equity will vary from business to business and will be affected by the
type of legal structure adopted by the business. This chapter will focus on the accounting
used in the most common type of business organization – the corporation. Accounting
and disclosure for other types of entities, such as proprietorships and partnerships, will
be different. However, the same basic principles apply to those types of entities as well.
Let’s now look at the various components of equity, using the classification from the Conceptual Framework : funds contributed by shareholders, retained earnings, and reserves.

18.1.1 Funds Contributed by Shareholders
The funds contributed by shareholders are often the initial capital used to start a business.
These funds are often referred to as contributed capital. In a corporate structure, contributed capital will take the form of shares, which can be classified into several different
types. Shares, themselves, are legal instruments that provide certain rights to the holder
and indicate a residual interest in the corporation’s assets. When a company is created,
its incorporating documents will specify the maximum number of shares that can be
issued. In some cases, this amount, referred to as authorized shares, may be specified
as unlimited, meaning the company can issue as many shares as it wants. From an
accounting perspective, the number of authorized shares is not relevant but the number
of issued shares is. Issued shares are shares that have been issued to shareholders,
usually in exchange for money, services, or other assets. Sometimes, a company may
repurchase its own shares and keep them in treasury, in which case the number of
issued shares will be greater than the number of outstanding shares (those shares held
by parties outside of the company). In some jurisdictions, shares can be issued with a
par value. This is the stated value of the share and will be directly indicated on the share
certificate. Where par value shares exist, the actual issue price may differ from the par
value. Amounts received by the corporation in excess of the par value represent another
form of contributed capital. This amount will be reported separately from the par value
of the shares and is often described as either contributed surplus or share premium.
Note that many jurisdictions do not allow par value shares, meaning the issue price would
simply be reported as the share capital amount. Shares can be stratified into different
classes, based on the different rights and characteristics. We will discuss some of these
different characteristics below.
Common Shares
Common shares, also referred to as ordinary shares, represent the final residual interest in a company’s assets after all other claims, including other equity interests, have

18.1. What is Equity?

243

been satisfied. In some companies, these are the only types of shares issued. These
shares represent the greatest level of risk to an investor should the company fail, as all
other claims against the company’s assets would need to be paid first. On the other
hand, these shares also represent potentially the greatest rewards, as all the profits not
otherwise allocated to debt and equity holders would belong to the common shareholders.
All companies must have at least one class of common shares, although they are not
always described this way. If a company issues more than one class of shares, and the
other classes have additional rights over the common shares, then those classes are not
common shares. Rather, they would be described as preferred shares.
Preferred Shares
Preferred shares, also known as preference shares, have special rights and privileges
that give them priority over the common shares. These special privileges are often
included to make the shares more attractive to investors. As well, the special rights
can allow for complex ownership structures where certain groups or individuals want to
maintain a degree of control. Because the preferred shares have special rights over the
common shares, they are not considered a residual interest. In the event of a business’s
liquidation, the preferred shareholders would rank ahead of the common shareholders in
the priority of payment, but they would still be subordinated to the debt holders.
Preferred shares have many different features that can be combined in multiple configurations to provide many classes of shares for investors to choose from. However, to
gain these special features, preferred shareholders often give up certain rights as well,
most commonly, the right to vote on the company’s management. In many corporate
structures, only the common shareholders have the right to vote for the board of directors, even though there may be several classes of shares. It is also important to note
that the classes of shares may not always be described as common or preferred in the
incorporation documents. The accountant must always be careful to closely examine the
economic substance of the share features, and not just rely on the descriptions used by
the company.
Let’s now look at some of the features of preferred shares.

• Fixed Dividend: Preferred shares often have a fixed dividend amount, usually
expressed as a numerical amount per share or sometimes as a percentage of the
par value of the share. For example, a preferred share could be entitled to a dividend
of 5% of the par value, or $5 per share. These dividends would be equivalent if the
share were issued at, or had a par value of, $100. Although the dividend amount
is stated, this does not guarantee that the preferred shareholder will receive the
dividend in any given year. Dividends must always be declared by the board of
directors, and the directors have the discretion not to pay a dividend. However, when
dividends are declared the holders of the preferred shares must be paid their stated
dividends first before any distributions can be made to the common shareholders.

244

Shareholders’ Equity

• Cumulative Dividend: If the directors do not declare a dividend in a current year,
the holders of cumulative preferred shares would be entitled to payment of the dividend in a future year. For this type of share, undeclared dividends will accumulate at
the stated rate for each year and must all be paid before any dividends can be paid
to the common shareholders. These unpaid dividends do not represent a liability
until the directors declare a dividend. Preferred shares can also specify a noncumulative dividend, which means any undeclared dividends in a given year are
simply lost and are not required to be paid in future years.
• Participating Dividend: When a preferred share is described as participating, it retains the right to receive not only the stated amount of dividends, but also additional
dividends based on certain criteria. A typical participation calculation would involve
first determining the fixed dividend on the preferred shares, and then allocating
a similar proportion to the common shares. Then, additional dividends beyond
these two amounts would be shared between the preferred and common shares
on a pro-rata basis. There are other, more complex, ways in which participation
can be calculated. The specific features of the preferred share would need to be
examined to determine the method of calculation. The participation feature can
make a preferred share more attractive to investors, as it provides the stability of
the fixed dividend, plus the ability to receive further dividends if the company is
successful.
• Redemption: A preferred share may be described as being redeemable. This
means the company has the right to call the shares and repurchase them at a
specified price during a specified time period. When the shares are redeemed, any
dividends in arrears must be paid.
• Retraction: This feature is attractive to shareholders, as it allows them the right to
require the company to repurchase the shares at a set price. Usually, time limits are
set for the retraction period.
• Convertibility: Some preferred shares retain the right to be converted into common
shares. The holder may choose to do this if the company has been successful and
if common dividends exceed the amount that can be earned by the fixed, preferred
dividend. The amount of common shares that can be obtained on conversion will be
specified as a ratio, such as two common shares for each preferred share held.

Any or all of these features can be attached to classes of preferred shares. Many companies will report multiple share classes, each with different features. In some cases,
the features included in a preferred share may suggest that its economic substance
is more akin to debt rather than equity. These types of shares should be classified
as liabilities, and their dividends would be classified as financing costs on the income
statement. Shares with these features are discussed further in Chapter 14: Complex
Financial Instruments.

18.1.2 Retained Earnings
The retained earnings account is a separate category of equity that represents the cumulative amount of profit earned by the company since its inception, less the cumulative
amount of dividends declared. Sometimes, either as a management choice or as a legal
requirement, certain portions of the retained earnings are set aside or appropriated.
Appropriations of retained earnings are created to ensure that dividends are not paid
from these balances, and these appropriations need to be reported separately. When the
retained earnings account falls into a negative (debit) balance, it is usually referred to as
a deficit, or retained losses. Retained earnings are sometimes subject to other types of
accounting adjustments, such as accounting policy changes and error corrections, which
are discussed in other chapters.

18.1.3 Reserves
The term reserves can refer to a number of different accounts. The previously noted
appropriations of retained earnings are normally described as reserves. Another type
of reserve is accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). As discussed in other
chapters, comprehensive income results from recognition of income or expense items that
are not included in the calculation of net income. There are only a few items that fall into
this category, the most common of which are gains resulting from the application of the
revaluation method for property, plant, and equipment, and intangibles; re-measurements
of defined benefit plans; and gains resulting from remeasurement of available-for-sale
financial instruments. These transactions create reserves that must be reported separately on the balance sheet. However, they may not always be described as accumulated
other comprehensive income. For example, the term revaluation surplus is often used
instead. Regardless of the name, the reserves must clearly identify the source of the
surplus, and separate reserves are required for each type of item.

18.2 Issuing Shares
When a company is first incorporated, it will be authorized to issue a certain number of
shares. This authorization does not, in and of itself, create any accounting transaction
that needs to be recorded. However, after the shares are authorized they can be issued,
which creates an accounting transaction. We will look at several examples of different
types of share issuances.
Shares Issued for Cash

246

Shareholders’ Equity

This is the simplest scenario: shares will be issued to the holder in exchange for a cash
payment. For example, if 10,000 common shares are issued at a price of $10 each, the
journal entry would be:

Note: Each class of shares should be recorded in a different account, as the disclosure
of the amounts of different classes of shares is required. Also, when brokerage houses,
agents, lawyers, and other professionals are involved in issuing the shares, any fees or
commissions charged by these parties should be directly deducted from the share capital
amount.
Par Value Shares Issued for Cash
In the example above, the net amount of cash received simply becomes the stated capital
amount of the shares. In some jurisdictions, shares are authorized with a par value,
which is a value that will be directly stated on the share certificate. However, as market
conditions will dictate the actual issue price of the shares, it is possible that an amount
greater than the par value will be received when the shares are issued. The excess
amount over the par value still represents contributed capital, but it must be recorded
separately. If, for example, 5,000 shares with a par value of $2 per share are issued for
$8, the journal entry would be:

The contributed surplus amount will be reported as part of the contributed capital on the
balance sheet. This account is sometimes described as share premium or additional
paid-in capital.
Subscribed Shares
Sometimes a company may offer shares on a subscription basis, allowing the holder to
pay for the shares in a series of payments. The accounting for these types of transactions
will depend on local legislation, the terms of the subscription contract, and corporate
policy. We will look at a few different examples of these types of transactions.
Scenario 1

18.2. Issuing Shares

247

A company offers to issue its shares in blocks of 20 at a price $60 per share. The contract
requires a 25% down payment with the remaining 75% payable in six months, and 100
individuals accept the offer. Local legislation does not allow shares to be issued until they
are fully paid. The following journal entries are required:

The share subscription receivable conceptually does not represent a receivable in the
conventional sense, as it represents a capital and not an income transaction. As such,
the most appropriate treatment would be to show it as a contra-equity account. However,
some argue that because it does represent a future benefit to the company, it should be
reported as an asset. Both presentations can be found in practice. The common shares
subscribed account should be shown as part of the contributed capital section, but it
should be segregated from the issued share capital.
In six months’ time, the following journal entry is required:

Note: If a dividend is declared between the subscription date and the final payment date,
the treatment of that dividend will depend on local legislation. Although it is likely that
the shares will not be eligible for dividends, as they have not yet been issued, some
jurisdictions allow the distribution of a pro-rata dividend based on the amount of cash
received to date. In our example, the subscribers would be eligible for 25% of the regular
dividend amount declared. Similarly, if a shareholders’ meeting is held during this interim
period, the subscribers may be eligible for a pro-rata share of votes at the meeting.
Scenario 2
Let’s assume the same set of facts as Scenario 1, except that 10 of the subscribers
default on their final payments. At the time of the initial subscription, the journal entry
will be identical to the one used in Scenario 1. However, at the time of final payment,
the journal entry will depend on local legislation, the subscription contract, and corporate

subscribers, then the journal entry would look like this:

Shares Issued for Goods or Services
Sometimes a company may issue shares in exchange for assets other than cash, or
in exchange for services provided. These situations may occur when a company is in
the start-up phase of its life cycle and wishes to preserve scarce cash resources. In
these cases, the shares should be recorded at the fair value of the asset acquired or
service received. Note that this treatment is different than the treatment of non-monetary
exchanges of assets, where the fair value of the asset given up is normally used as the
transaction amount. This difference results because fair values of assets or services are
usually more reliable than fair values of shares. In the rare circumstance that the fair
values of the assets or services cannot be determined, the fair value of the shares issued
should then be used. This value is obviously easier to determine for a publicly traded
company. In all cases, non-monetary exchanges for shares will involve the exercise of
good judgment on the part of the accountant.
A company may also issue its shares in exchange for shares of another company. This
type of business combination is an advanced financial accounting concept that is not
covered in this text.

18.3 Reacquiring Shares
Companies will sometimes buy back their own shares, often done to try to stabilize
their share price or improve certain financial ratios, such as earnings per share. A
share may also be repurchased as a way to return excess cash to shareholders without
having to pay a dividend. Additionally, there may also be certain strategic benefits in
repurchasing shares. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: the shares are no
longer outstanding. After repurchase, the shares may continue to be held by the company
as issued shares, which are referred to as treasury shares, or they may be cancelled. If
they are held as treasury shares, they may be resold at a later date to new shareholders.
However, if the shares are cancelled, then they must be completely removed from the
accounting records. Note that some jurisdictions do not allow treasury shares, meaning

250

Shareholders’ Equity

that any repurchased shares must be immediately cancelled. We will examine the reacquisition of shares for both cancellation and non-cancellation situations below.
Shares Repurchased and Cancelled
The IFRS does not provide any specific guidance on how to account for the repurchase
of shares. However, ASPE does provide a set of steps to apply when shares are either
repurchased or cancelled. These procedures contemplate two possible situations:

a. The shares’ acquisition cost is greater than, or equal to, the assigned value.
In this situation, the acquisition cost is allocated in the following sequence:
• First to share capital in an amount equal to the par, stated, or assigned value
• Any excess to contributed surplus, to the extent that the balance of contributed
surplus was created by a previous cancellation of the same class of shares
• Any further excess to contributed surplus in an amount equal to the pro-rata
share of the contributed surplus that arose from transactions, other than those
above, in the same class of shares (for example, a share premium from a
previous issue of par value shares)
• Any remaining excess to retained earnings.
b. The shares acquisition cost is less than, or equal to, the assigned value.
In this situation, the acquisition cost is allocated in the following sequence:
• First to share capital in an amount equal to the par, stated, or assigned value
• Any excess to contributed surplus (CPA Canada, 2016, Accounting, ASPE
3240.11 and 3240.13).
In part (b), the balance is included as an increase to contributed surplus because
it wouldn’t be appropriate to report income from a share capital transaction. Also,
note that where the shares are not par value shares, the assigned value indicated
above is calculated as the weighted average cost of the shares at the transaction
date.

The following illustration demonstrates the above rules:
On January 1, 2016, a company had 100,000, no-par value common shares outstanding
that were issued for total proceeds of $1,060,000. There was no contributed surplus
associated with these shares on that date. On March 1, 2016, the company repurchased
and cancelled 8,000 of these shares at a cost of $8 per share. The journal entry would
be:

a cost of $14 per share. The journal entry would be:

The common shares are again eliminated at their new average cost: ($975,200 ÷ 92,000) =
$10.60. The previous contributed surplus is fully utilized, with an additional excess amount
being charged to retained earnings.
In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, there may be additional legal restrictions that influence the accounting for share repurchases and cancellations. For example,
on a share repurchase a company may be required to reallocate part of the retained
earnings balance to a capital redemption reserve. This is done to provide a level of
protection to the company’s creditors, as the capital redemption reserve is generally not
available for use in subsequent dividend payments.
Shares Repurchased and Not Cancelled
When a company repurchases its own shares, but doesn’t cancel them, the returned
shares are referred to as treasury shares. These shares are essentially held by the
company to be issued at a later date. ASPE indicates a preference for what is known
as the single-transaction method, which considers the repurchase, and subsequent reissuance of the shares, as a single transaction. In this case, treasury shares held at
the balance sheet date that have not yet been re-issued or cancelled are reported as a
deduction from the total shareholders’ equity. They cannot be considered an asset as the
company is merely holding shares of itself. When the treasury shares are first acquired,
the journal entry would simply require a debit to the treasury shares account and a credit
to cash. If the shares are subsequently re-issued, then the treasury shares account will be
credited and cash will be debited. Any difference will be allocated to contributed surplus

252

Shareholders’ Equity

or retained earnings in a process that is essentially the inverse of the cancellation journal
entries shown previously. If the shares are subsequently cancelled, rather than being
reissued, then cancellation procedures outlined previously are followed.

18.4 Dividends
Cash Dividends
For investors, receiving dividends represents one of the essential motivations for holding
shares. Although many established companies may have a policy of paying regular
and predictable dividends, shareholders understand that there is no automatic right to
dividends. The payment of dividends is decided by the board of directors and is based on
several relevant criteria. First, the dividend must be legal. The rules for dividends vary by
jurisdiction, but essentially the company must have sufficient distributable profits to pay
the dividend. Some jurisdictions have complex methods of calculating this amount, but
it can often be approximated using the balance in the retained earnings account. The
purpose of limiting the dividends is to ensure that the company is not left in a position
where it cannot pay its liabilities. Directors need to be aware of the legal requirements
for dividend payments, as the payment of an illegal dividend could result in personal
liability to the director if the company cannot, subsequently, pay its creditors. Second, the
company must have sufficient cash to pay the dividend. Cash flow planning is important to
the management of a business, and although the company may have sufficient retained
earnings to declare a dividend, it may not have the cash readily available. Remember
that the retained earnings balance does not equal cash, as companies will invest in
many different types of assets. Third, the dividend must fit with the company’s strategic
priorities. A company that is able to pay dividends may choose not to in order to preserve
cash for various future uses, such as reinvestment in capital assets, funding strategic
acquisitions, entrance into new markets, funding share buybacks, and committing to
research and development. As well, a company may not want to pay the maximum
dividend it is legally entitled to because it does not want to create unrealistic expectations
among shareholders for future dividends.
Once the directors have decided to declare a dividend, three significant dates need to
be considered. First, the date of declaration is the date the board of directors meets to
approve the dividend payment. This will be formally documented as a directors’ resolution,
and it is on this date that a liability is created, for both legal and accounting purposes.
Second, in the directors’ resolution, the date of record will be specified, which is the date
on which a list of the shareholders who will receive dividends is compiled. Obviously,
between the date of declaration and the date of record, shares will trade at a price based
on the understanding that whoever holds the shares on the date of record is eligible for
the dividend. Note, for many public stock exchanges, an ex-dividend date may also be
relevant. This is a date several days before the date of record, which allows a period

18.4. Dividends

253

of time for share transactions to be processed. Third, sometime after the date of record
is the date of payment. It is on this day that dividend payments are distributed to the
shareholders of record.
Consider the following example. A company with 500,000 outstanding common shares
declares a dividend of $0.75 per share on January 20. The resolution indicates a record
date of January 31 and a payment date of February 15. The following journal entries
would be made on each date:

Note: The dividends can be expressed as a per share amount, or they may be described
as a percentage of the share’s par value. Also, no dividends are paid on treasury shares
as the company cannot pay itself.
Property Dividends
In certain instances, a company may choose to pay a dividend with assets other than
cash. This could include shares of other companies held as investments, property, plant

254

Shareholders’ Equity

and equipment, inventory, or any other asset held. These types of transactions are rare
for three obvious reasons: 1) the asset must be equally divisible among all holders of
a particular class of shares, 2) the fair value of the asset needs to be determined, and
3) the asset must be able to be physically distributed to the shareholders. When the
company can overcome these restrictions, the property dividend will be recorded in a
manner similar to the journal entries previously identified. There will be an additional
step, however, in that the asset must first be revalued to its fair value before the dividend
is distributed. This will usually result in a gain or loss being recorded, which is appropriate
as the asset is being disposed of to settle a liability.
Share Dividends
One way that a company can distribute a dividend to shareholders without depleting its
cash resources is to pay a share (stock) dividend. This dividend distributes additional
shares of the company to the shareholders proportional to their current holdings. For
example, if a company declares a 5% share dividend, a shareholder who currently holds
100 shares would receive an additional five shares. Although there may be some complicated jurisdictional legal requirements regarding share dividends, the general principle is
that they should be recorded at the fair value of the shares issued.
Consider the following example. A company currently has 100,000 shares outstanding
that are trading at $5.25 per share. The company decides to declare a 5% share dividend,
which means an additional 5,000 shares will be issued to existing shareholders (100,000×
5%). Immediately prior to the dividend declaration, the implied value of the company is
$525,000 (100,000 × $5.25). Because a share dividend does not have any effect on
the assets or liabilities of the company, we would expect the total value of the company
to remain the same after the dividend. However, we would expect the market price per
share to drop to $5.00 per share ($525,000 ÷105,000), as the value is now spread among
more shares.
The journal entries to record this transaction, assuming the share price drops to $5 as
expected, would be as follows:

Note: The fair value we use to determine the amount is the post-dividend (sometimes
referred to as ex-dividend) value of $5.00 per share × 5,000 shares = $25,000. Also, if
the company’s year-end were to fall between the declaration date and the payment date,
then the share dividends distributable balance would be reported in the equity section of
the balance sheet, as it does not represent a liability like a cash dividend payable.
Declaring a share dividend causes part of the company’s retained earnings to become
capitalized as contributed capital (common shares). By doing so, the company has
removed this portion of retained earnings from the pool of distributable earnings that can
be later used to pay cash dividends.
Share Splits
Share splits, also known as stock splits, scrip issues, or bonus issues, are similar to share
dividends except they have a different accounting treatment. Generally, the motivation for
a share split is to reduce the market price of the share. For example, if the share price has
risen to a point where it is no longer affordable, this makes it difficult for the company to
sell shares to the public. A share split will be expressed as a proportion, such as a 2-for-1
split. This means that for every share held an additional share will be issued. Thus, after
the 2-for-1 split, the number of outstanding shares will be twice the previous number. This
will normally have the effect of reducing the market price of the share by half, so that the
total market capitalization remains unchanged.
Because there is no change in the economic resources or position of the company, no
journal entry is required to record a share split. However, a memorandum entry should
be made, noting the new number of shares. This will be important in the future for the
purposes of calculating dividend payments and earnings per share amounts.
In some cases, it may be difficult to distinguish between a share split and a large share
dividend. For example, the effects of a 100% share dividend and a 2-for-1 share split
are essentially the same. As IFRS does not provide any specific guidance on this issue,
professional judgment and consideration of the relevant legal framework will be required
in determining how to record large share dividends.
A company may also engage in a reverse share split, sometimes referred to as a share
consolidation. This will reduce the number of outstanding shares by a certain proportion.
This type of transaction is usually motivated by the need to increase the market price of a
share.

256

Shareholders’ Equity

18.4.1 Preferred Share Dividends
As noted previously, a feature of preferred shares is that they often receive preferential
treatment when dividends are declared. We will now look at some examples of how
dividends are calculated when preferred shares are outstanding.
Assume a company has two classes of shares: 1) common shares, of which 100,000
are outstanding with a carrying amount of $480,000, and 2) preferred shares with a fixed
dividend of $2 per share, of which 20,000 are outstanding with a carrying amount of
$320,000. In the current year, the company has declared total dividends of $120,000.
Dividends will be allocated to each class of shares as follows:

a. Preferred shares are non-cumulative and non-participating:

Total

Note: The basic preferred dividend is calculated as before. Then, a like amount is allocated to the common shares. The preferred dividend can be expressed as a percentage:
$40,000 ÷ $320,000 = 12.5%. Therefore, the common shares are also allocated a basic
dividend of (12.5% × $480,000) = $60,000. This leaves a remaining dividend of $20,000,
which is available for participation. The participation is allocated on a pro-rata basis as
follows:
Carrying amounts of each class:
Preferred
Common
Total

$320,000
480,000
$800,000

40%
60%

The participating dividend is therefore:
Preferred
Common

$20,000 × 40%
$20,000 × 60%

=
=

$ 8,000
$12,000

If the preferred shares were cumulative and fully participating, the process followed is the
same as above, except the dividends available for participation must be reduced by any
preferred dividends in arrears, as these must be paid first before any dividends can be
paid to common shareholders.
The pro-rata allocation of the participating dividend, shown above, is one way to determine
the rate of participation. However, if a company’s articles of incorporation specify other
methods of participation for different classes of shares, then these calculations must be
applied instead.

Shareholders’ Equity

Note that a number of contributed capital accounts are included, such as the share capital
and the capital reserves, along with a deduction for treasury shares. Other reserve
accounts with specific purposes, such as fair value reserves (i.e., accumulated other
comprehensive income), are also identified and segregated based on their purpose. The
company also separately identifies an account for retained earnings, using the title Profit
and Loss account. IAS 1: 106 specifies the disclosure requirements of the statement of
changes in equity. Key disclosures include total comprehensive income for the period, a
reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of each component of equity, including
changes due to other comprehensive income and profit or loss, dividends, transactions
with owners, and changes due to retrospective adjustments due to error corrections or
accounting policy changes. As long as the meaning and purpose of the accounts are
clear, companies may use terminology that is not precisely the same as suggested in
the Conceptual Framework. Additionally, companies may choose to provide subtotals for
certain types of account categories, such as contributed capital or reserves. Contributed
capital represents amounts contributed by shareholders, including share capital, share
premiums, and contributed surplus balances related to share transactions.
In addition to the statement of changes in equity, the financial statements of this energy
company contain a further five pages of explanatory notes, which provide more details
of the equity accounts. Some of these details include a breakdown of the features and
rights of different classes of share capital, a reconciliation of the six reserve accounts, and
details of treasury share transactions. IAS 1 specifically requires the following disclosures
either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes:
a. For each class of share capital:
i. The number of shares authorized
ii. The number of shares issued and fully paid, and issued but not fully paid
iii. Par value per share, or that the shares have no par value
iv. A reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding at the beginning and at
the end of the period
v. The rights, preferences, and restrictions attaching to that class including restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of capital
vi. Shares in the entity held by the entity or by its subsidiaries or associates and
vii. Shares reserved for issue under options and contracts for the sale of shares,
including terms and amounts
b. A description of the nature and purpose of each reserve within equity (CPA Canada,
2016, Accounting, IAS 1: 79).
Disclosure must also be made of the amount of dividends declared during the year, both in
total and per share. Paragraphs 134 to 138 of IAS 1 also contain detailed requirements of

18.6. IFRS/ASPE Key Differences

information to be disclosed regarding the company’s objectives, policies, and processes
for managing capital.
The substantial disclosure requirements for equity accounts result from the need to serve
one of the primary user groups of financial statements: the investors. When investing
in a company, one needs a clear understanding of how capital is structured, the various
rights and restrictions of different equity categories, and the impact of dividend payments.
The need for this type of information, combined with the complex legal nature of equity
instruments, creates substantial disclosure requirements that the professional accountant
needs to be aware of when drafting financial statements.

18.6 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
IFRS
No specific guidance for treasury shares.

No specific guidance for re-acquisition of
shares.

Accumulated other comprehensive income is included as a component of equity, usually disclosed as part the balance

as either a single transaction or as two
transactions, although ASPE expresses
a preference for the single-transaction
method.
Guidance provided that shows the order
in which proceeds paid should be applied (share capital, contributed surplus,

Shareholders’ Equity

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe the different forms of equity and identify the key
features that are important for accounting purposes.
Equity represents the residual interest in a business held by the owners, or the difference
between assets and liabilities. Equity can take the form of funds contributed by shareholders (common and preferred shares and contributed surplus), retained earnings, and
other reserves. Preferred shares will have legal features that give them preference when
dividends are distributed, and may have other features that will affect their classification
as a liability or equity. Retained earnings represent the accumulated profits of a business,
less any dividend distributions made. Reserves can take a number of forms, but are often
the result of retained earnings appropriations or the application of several accounting
standards that result in re-measurements that lead to revaluation surpluses.

LO 2: Explain and apply accounting standards for different types of
share issues.
When shares are issued for cash, the par value (or full amount of proceeds if there is no
par value) is credited to common share capital. The balance of proceeds in excess of the
par value is credited to contributed surplus. When shares are issued by subscription, a
receivable is created and an interim share capital account (shares subscribed) is created,
as unpaid shares normally cannot be issued. The interim share account is eliminated
when the final payment is received and shares are actually issued. If a subscriber defaults,
the accounting treatment will depend on legal requirements, the subscription contract, and
corporate policy. When shares are issued in exchange for goods or services, the shares
should be recorded at the fair value of the goods or services received.

LO 3: Explain and apply accounting standards for different
situations that can occur when shares are reacquired.
When shares are reacquired, they may either be cancelled or retained as treasury shares.
When they are cancelled, the proceeds paid should first be allocated to share capital at
the average issue cost, then to contributed surplus that relates to the class of shares, and
finally to retained earnings, if necessary. When shares are retained as treasury shares,
the amount of the proceeds is a debit to a treasury share account until the shares are
either reissued or cancelled. The treasury share account is reported as a contra-equity
amount.

Chapter Summary

263

LO 4: Describe the accounting treatments for different types of
dividends and calculate divided allocations when preferred shares
exist.
Dividends represent distributions of earnings to shareholders and may take several forms.
The most common form is dividends paid in cash. When dividends are declared, a journal
entry is required to establish the liability. No journal entry is required on the date of
record, but a journal entry will be required to record the actual payment of dividends.
Property dividends require the asset being distributed to be revalued to its fair value
immediately prior to the distribution. Share dividends should be reported at the share’s fair
value immediately after the distribution (ex-dividend amount). Share dividends essentially
capitalize part of the company’s retained earnings and remove them from future dividend
distributions. Share splits do not require any journal entries, and are usually motivated by
a desire to lower the company’s share price. When preferred shares are outstanding, the
declared dividends must first be allocated to the preferred shares, based on the stated
rate and the cumulative and participating features that may be present in those shares.

LO 5: Describe the presentation and disclosure requirements for
shareholders’ equity accounts.
IFRS requires presentation of a statement of changes in equity that details the opening
and closing balances of all equity accounts, along with details of changes during the
year. As well, significant disclosures of the legal requirements and features of different
classes of shares are required, along with descriptions of the purposes of the different
reserve accounts. Dividends declared during the year must also be disclosed, along with
a discussion of the company’s capital management activities.

LO 6: Identify differences in the accounting treatment of
shareholders’ equity between IFRS and ASPE.
ASPE provides specific guidance for treasury shares and the re-acquisition of shares,
whereas IFRS does not. Accumulated other comprehensive income is a category of
equity that exists in IFRS but not ASPE. A statement of changes in equity is required by
IFRS, but ASPE usually presents a retained earnings statement and note disclosures.
Capital management disclosures are required under IFRS but not ASPE.

Earnings per Share

Facebook and Twitter: Same Industry, But Two Different Stories
Facebook and Twitter reported very different earnings performance in Q2 of 2015.
Facebook stocks increased by nearly 30% in the previous year while Twitter struggled.
Twitter’s stock had lost more than 7% from 2014 and more than 33% from its high in
April 2015. Since both are social media companies, why such a difference?
Twitter was in transition while it searched for a new CEO, resulting in a company
operating without a leader or a strategic plan. Moreover, plans to make the software
app more user-friendly had been delayed. Some increases in earnings per share
were anticipated by the market, but this was overshadowed by the key performance
metric of growth for this industry, the Average Monthly Active Users (MAUs), which fell
short of analysts’ expectations.
Facebook on the other hand had 4.7 times Twitter’s user base and had been
increasing its earnings per share by giant leaps, making this company the eighth
largest company in America by the market. Growth is expected to continue, even
if at a slower rate typical of companies that reach giant-size proportions. Moreover,
Bank of America has added Facebook to its list of top investment ideas due to the
firm’s improved advertising targeting through Instagram, its video campaigns, and its
growth of new software platforms such as Messenger. Facebook has also leveraged
its investments in ramping up sharing instant news articles and following public figures
campaigns (areas that were once dominated by Twitter). Both developments have
resulted in increased followers and have been very successful.
Time will tell if Twitter can make up for its lost market position.

19.1. Earnings per Share: Overview

273

19.1 Earnings per Share: Overview
Just how important are earnings per share? Before that question can be answered, it
is important to understand what this metric is. Earnings are simply a company’s net
income or net profit. As every company has a different number of shares owned by its
shareholders, comparing only their earnings figures is like comparing apples to oranges.
It does not indicate how much income each company earned for each of its common
shareholders. So, earnings per share (EPS) becomes a per share way of describing net
income, making EPS a good metric for shareholders and potential investors.
Earnings season is the stock market’s equivalent to a school report card. It happens four
times per year in many countries where publicly traded companies report their financial
results. Although it is important to remember that investors look at all financial information,
EPS is the most important number released during an earnings season and it attracts the
most attention and media coverage. Before earnings reports come out, stock market
analysts issue earnings estimates in terms of what they think earnings will be. Research
firms subsequently compile these forecasts into a consensus earnings estimate. When
a company is able to beat this estimate, it is called an earnings surprise, and the stock
market price usually moves higher. Conversely, if a company releases earnings below
these estimates, it is said to disappoint, and the market price for the stock typically moves
lower. It is difficult to guess how a stock will move during an earnings season as it is
based on expectations, which supports the efficient market hypothesis. Shareholders
and potential investors care about EPS because it ultimately drives stock prices.
Sometimes a company with a sky-rocketing stock price might not be making the earnings
to support the rise, but the rising price means that investors are hoping – the expectation
factor – that the company will be profitable in the future. But, there are no guarantees that
the company will fulfill investors’ current expectations.
When a company is making net income and has a positive EPS, it has two options. First,
it can retain its net income to improve its products and develop new ones. Second, it can
either pay a dividend as a return on investment, or offer a share buyback at a higher price.
In the first instance, management reinvests profits in the hope of making more profits. In
the second instance, the investor receives a more immediate return on investment via the
dividend and capital appreciation of the share market price. Typically, smaller companies
attempt to create shareholder value by reinvesting profits, while more mature companies
pay out dividends. Neither method is necessarily better, but both rely on the same idea:
in the long run, earnings provide a return on shareholders’ investments, and EPS is the
metric used to determine the magnitude of this return.
To summarize, earnings means profit, and is often evaluated in terms of earnings per
share. Existing and potential shareholders and analysts use EPS to evaluate a company’s
performance, to predict future earnings, and to estimate the value of a company’s shares.

274

Earnings per Share

In terms of the stock market, EPS is the most important indicator of a company’s financial
health. Earnings reports are released quarterly and are followed very closely by the
stock market, news media, and company shareholders. It is little wonder that EPS has
become such a deeply entrenched metric to evaluate company performance for common
shareholders and potential investors (Investopedia, n.d.).

19.2 Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share: A Review
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is simply:

Basic EPS =

Net income available to common shareholders
Weighted average number of common shares outstanding

Basic EPS quantifies the amount of earnings attributable to each common share issued.
If a company’s capital is composed of common shares and preferred shares or debt that
has no conversion rights, this is referred to as a company with a simple capital structure.
Capital structures that include securities that have conversion rights such as convertible
preferred shares, convertible bonds payable, and stock options are known as companies
with complex capital structures. Complex capital structures for publicly traded companies require another indicator to be calculated and reported, which is called diluted
EPS. Dilution occurs when additional common shares are issued without a proportionate
increase in the level of earnings or resources that generate those earnings. For example,
shares issued for cash will increase both the number of shares and the resources (cash
as an asset) so they are not dilutive. Shares issued to holders of convertible securities
increases the number of shares and not necessarily with a corresponding increase in
company resources. They are, therefore, potentially dilutive. Diluted EPS is often referred
to as a worst-case scenario measurement, where the effect on earnings per share is
measured assuming that all potential additional common shares for convertible securities,
options, and warrants have already been issued since the beginning of the year.
In terms of reporting requirements, ASPE companies are not required to report EPS
statistics, which makes intuitive sense given that these companies are privately owned,
with an often closely held stockholder base. On the other hand, an IFRS company that is
publicly traded is required to disclose basic EPS and diluted EPS on the face of its income
statement. Moreover, if a company reports discontinued operations, EPS disclosures
must also further break down EPS into income from continuing operations, discontinued
operations, and net income. An example of basic and diluted EPS with discontinued
operations is shown below:

* EPS for discontinued operations disclosures is a required disclosure, but it may be included in the notes
to financial statements.

Recall the importance of being able to differentiate between what earnings from ongoing,
or continuing, operations from those that will not continue. This was discussed in the
chapter regarding the statement of net income.
The components of the basic EPS numerator and denominator are discussed next.

19.2.1 Basic Earnings per Share
Numerator: Net Income Available to Common Shareholders
Two things to keep in mind regarding determining the net income numerator amount:
1. Net income is relevant to this calculation but other comprehensive income (OCI)
is not. OCI includes items such as unrealized gains or losses for securities that
management does not intend to actively trade, hence these types of gains and
losses are not deemed to be part of the company’s current period performance.
2. If preferred shares exist, then net income (or loss) available to common shareholders
must be adjusted by the preferred shares dividends. This is because preferred
shares rank in seniority over common shares regarding dividends, therefore, if necessary, a portion of net income has to be set aside to cover these dividends. The
adjustment amount to deduct from net income will differ if the preferred shares are
cumulative or non-cumulative:
• If cumulative, deduct the dividend amount from net income according to the
preferred share’s entitlement, which is the stated dividend rate regardless
of whether they were declared or paid. If dividends are in arrears, only the
current year’s dividend is to be deducted from net income since the EPS figures
reported in previous years already included the dividend for that year.
• If non-cumulative, deduct the dividend amount from net income only if it has
been declared, regardless of their stated dividend rate or if they were paid or
not. Non-cumulative preferred shares are only entitled to a dividend if the board
of directors declares one. The amount of the dividend declared can be based

276

Earnings per Share

on their stated dividend rate or it can be less. There are no dividends in arrears
for non-cumulative preferred shares in cases where the board does not declare
one.

For example, Ogdell Co. has a net income of $350,000 and has two classes of preferred
shares as follows:

• Class A: $3 cumulative preferred shares. Authorized 20,000; issued and outstanding, 10,000 shares.
• Class B: $4 non-cumulative preferred shares. Authorized 30,000; issued and outstanding, 15,000 shares.
• No dividends have been declared or paid in the current year. The income available
to common shareholders would be calculated as follows:
Income Available to Common Shareholders
Net income (loss)
$ 350,000
Less:
Class A: $3, cumulative, preferred shares
(30,000)
(issued 10,000 shares × stated rate of $3)
Class B: $4, non-cumulative, preferred shares
–
(no dividend declared)
Income available to common shareholders
$ 320,000

Dividend entitlement

Dividend declared

Assume now that Ogdell Co. has a net loss of $125,000 and that the Class A preferred
shares have dividends in arrears from the previous year of $15,000. In the current year,
the board of directors declared a total dividend to both classes of preferred shareholders of $50,000. The income available to common shareholders would be calculated as
follows:
Income Available to Common Shareholders
Net income (loss)
($125,000)
Plus:
Class A: $3, cumulative, preferred shares
(30,000)
(issued 10,000 shares × stated rate of $3)
Class B: $4, non-cumulative, preferred shares
(5,000)*
($50,000 − 15,000 arrears − 30,000)
Net income (loss) available to common shareholders ($160,000)

Dividend entitlement

19.2. Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share: A Review

277

* The total dividend of $50,000 declared will first be applied to the Class A preferred shares dividends in
arrears of $15,000 and next to the Class A current year dividends of $30,000, leaving a declared dividend
for the Class B, non-cumulative shares of $5,000.

Denominator: Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding (WACS)
Two types of events can affect the WACS calculation:

1. If common shares have been issued or purchased for consideration, that is, cash in
exchange for assets or other consideration, the average must be weighted by the
number of months these have been outstanding during the current fiscal year.
2. If stock dividends or stock splits (or reverse stock splits) occur, the number of shares
outstanding must be restated on a retroactive basis as though the stock dividend or
split had occurred at the beginning of the year. (These may also be referred to
as share dividends and share splits.) The shares issued before the stock dividend
or split will now be restated on the same basis as shares issued after the stock
dividend or split. If the stock dividend or split occurs after the year-end, but before
the financial statements are issued, the WACS are to be restated for the year just
ended. Additionally, any previous year’s EPS included in the comparative financial statements are also to be restated. The restatement ensures that the EPS is
prepared on a consistent basis over the reporting period to enhance comparability
and minimize potential manipulation of the EPS amounts because of performance
benchmarks or restrictive debt covenants.

To ensure that the WACS are calculated correctly, there are three steps in the preparation
of the WACS schedule:

• Step 1: Record the opening balance of shares outstanding and each subsequent
event, date, description, and number of shares for the current reporting period. An
event is when the outstanding number of shares changes, such as when shares are
issued or repurchased for either cash, as stock dividends, or for stock splits. Complete the total shares outstanding for each row. If shares are issued on December
31, 2015, they are ignored for the purposes of calculating the WACS because they
have not been outstanding during the year.
• Step 2: For stock dividends or stock splits, apply the required retroactive restatement factor(s) from the event date when it initially occurs, and backwards to the
beginning of the fiscal year.
• Step 3: For each event, complete the duration between events under the date
column and complete the corresponding fraction of the year column accordingly.
Multiply the shares outstanding times the retroactive restatement factor(s) times the

278

Earnings per Share

fraction of the year for each event. Sum the amounts to determine the WACS total
amount.
Continuing with our example for Ogdell Co., assume that the company had 130,000
common shares outstanding on January 1, 2015. The following events occurred during
the year:
• On February 1, 2015, an additional 20,000 shares were issued.
• On May 1, 2015, the company repurchased 1,000 shares.
• On July 1, 2015, the company declared and issued a 10% stock dividend.
• On September 1, 2015, the company issued another 15,000 shares.
• On November 1, 2015, the company declared and issued a two-for-one stock split.
Step 1: Record the opening balance of shares outstanding and each subsequent event,
date, description, and number of shares for the current reporting period. An event is
where the outstanding number of shares changes such as when shares are issued or repurchased for either cash, as stock dividends or for stock splits. Complete the total shares
outstanding for each row. If shares are issued on December 31, 2015, they are ignored
for the purposes of calculating the WACS because they have not been outstanding during
the year.

280

Earnings per Share

Co.’s net income was $350,000, and the company had two classes of preferred shares as
follows:
• Class A: $3 cumulative preferred shares, authorized 20,000, issued and outstanding, 10,000 shares.
• Class B: $4 non-cumulative preferred shares, authorized 30,000, issued and outstanding, 15,000 shares.
• No dividends have been declared or paid in the current year. The income available to common shareholders was calculated earlier to be $320,000 ($350,000 −
$30,000 preferred dividends).
The numerator and denominator are now both calculated, so the basic earnings per share
calculation can now be completed as follows:

Basic EPS =

Net income available to common shareholders
Weighted average number of common shares outstanding

Basic EPS =

$320,000
= $0.9556 or $0.96 rounded per share
334,865

If Ogdell Co. also had a discontinued operations loss of $20,000 net of tax, the basic EPS
would be calculated as follows:

19.2.2 Diluted Earnings per Share
As previously stated, any publicly traded company with a complex capital structure is
to also disclose diluted EPS, separated into continuing operations and non-continuing
operations, like basic EPS illustrated above. This indicator assumes that all dilutive
securities are converted to common shares, which give shareholders a worst-case scenario of the lowest possible EPS about company performance. The dilutive calculation
also assumes that, since the conversion to common shares has fully taken place, the
convertible securities themselves will be extinguished and the company will no longer
be obligated to pay interest or dividends on the original security. In other words, the
dilutive calculation will affect both the income available to shareholders (numerator) and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) in the original
equation:

Diluted EPS =

Net income available to common shareholder + adjustments from
dilutive securities that are ranked from most dilutive to least dilutive
Weighted average number of common shares outstanding +
adjustments from dilutive securities that are ranked from most
dilutive to least dilutive

Below are three steps that, if followed carefully, will make the diluted EPS calculation
easier:
Step 1: Identify all potentially dilutive securities. These can be convertible bonds or
convertible preferred shares, both exchangeable into common shares or stock options and
warrants that entitle the holder to buy common shares at a specified price. The conversion
feature details will be itemized in the documentation for each convertible security and
will include information regarding the conversion time frame, the rate of conversion to
common shares, and the specified price to purchase common shares, if applicable.
Step 2: Calculate the individual effect of each potentially dilutive security and rank
them from most to least dilutive. Some of these securities will only affect the number
of shares (denominator) such as stock options, warrants, and contingent commitments
for shares, while others such as convertible bonds and convertible preferred shares will
affect both the income available to common shareholders (numerator) and number of
shares (denominator).
Step 3: Complete a diluted EPS schedule and report the results, starting with
the basic EPS numerator and denominator amounts. Transfer the numerator and

282

Earnings per Share

denominator amounts from the individual effects calculated in Step 2 above for each
convertible security identified as dilutive, in ranked order, and calculate a diluted EPS
subtotal after each. Remove any securities whose subtotal indicates that an increase in
diluted EPS has occurred. Complete the EPS disclosures resulting from the analyses.
Diluted EPS Example
Using the steps outlined above, and continuing with the example for Ogdell Co., the basic
EPS before discontinued operations is:

Income from continuing operations
available to common shareholders

Income

WACS

$320,000

334,865

Basic EPS
$0.9556

Step 1: Identify and calculate the individual effects for all potentially dilutive options, warrants, and other contingent commitments.
Stock options allow the option holder either to buy shares (call options) or sell shares
(put options) for a specified price (exercise price) within a time limit as defined by the
option document. If the options are in the money (i.e., the specified price compared to
the current market price will result in a benefit to the holder), and the holder proceeds
to exercise the options, the company is obligated to sell (write) or to buy (purchase) the
shares as set out in the options agreement. Conversely, if the options are not in the
money, the option holder will not exercise them, and the options will eventually expire.
Therefore, it follows that only options that are in the money will be dilutive as they are the
only ones that will be exercised.
For example, if the option holder purchased call options that entitles her or him to purchase common shares for $30 each, at a time when the current market price for the
shares has risen to $36 each, it is likely that the option holder will exercise the right
to purchase as the shares are in the money. Issuing more shares to the option holder
increases the total number of shares issued (denominator); as such, the options must
be included in the diluted EPS calculations. However, as the effect on net income from
the exercise of options is not easy to estimate, the treasury stock method is chosen
to calculate the dilutive effect of options and warrants, which limits the calculation to the
number of shares denominator value. It also assumes that the company would use the
monies received from the option holders to repurchase common shares from the market
and subsequently retire them. This would lessen the dilutive impact on EPS. Put another
way, shares would be issued to the holders and the resulting proceeds would be used
to repurchase its own shares from the market. Since the exercise price is less than the
current market price, more shares would be issued than could be repurchased from the
market. This difference is the additional number of shares to be included in the diluted
EPS calculation using the treasury stock method.

19.2. Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share: A Review

283

For example, Ogdell Co. has (call) options outstanding that entitle the option holder to
purchase 1,000 common shares for an exercise, or strike, price of $30 per share. The
company has performed well lately, and the average market price per share has risen to
$50.1 Option holders will benefit from purchasing the shares for $30, so these options are
in the money and are dilutive under the treasury stock method. The difference between
the 1,000 shares issued to the option holders and the number of shares that the company
could repurchase with the proceeds, given a market price of $50, is as follows:
Treasury Stock Method
Proceeds received from exercise of options
(1,000 shares × $30 per share = $30,000)

1,000

shares

Proceeds used to purchase common shares from the market
($30,000 ÷ $50 market price per share)

(600)

shares

shares

Incremental shares issued

If Ogdell has (put) options outstanding that entitle the option holder to sell 1,000 common
shares back to the company at an exercise price of $40 per share, when the current
average market price is $35, these would also be considered in the money and dilutive.
In this case, the reverse treasury stock method would be used, which assumes that
the company would issue enough shares for cash in the market at the beginning of the
year to cover their obligation to buy back the put options. As option holders will benefit
from selling the shares at $40 each, the options are considered in the money and dilutive
under the reverse treasury stock method. The proceeds required by the company to meet
their obligations to the option holders would be $40,000 (1,000 × $40). If the current
market price is currently $35 per share, the company would have to ensure that it issued
an additional 1,143 shares ($40,000 ÷ $35) at the beginning of the year in order to have
enough proceeds available to meet their obligation to buy back the 1,000 shares from the
option holders. The difference between the 1,143 shares issued for cash at the beginning
of the year and the subsequent buy-back of 1,000 shares from the options holders, or 143
shares, would be included in the diluted EPS calculation in the same way as is shown for
the (call) options illustrated above.
Contingently issuable shares can also be considered dilutive if they meet the criteria at
any point during the reporting period. For example, if shares are issuable to key executive
when earnings reach a certain level, and this level had already been achieved by the
1

IAS 33.45 (CPA Canada, 2016) states that the average market price is to be used in the following
manner: “For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, an entity shall assume the exercise of
dilutive options and warrants of the entity. The assumed proceeds from these instruments shall be regarded
as having been received from the issue of ordinary shares at the average market price of ordinary shares
during the period. The difference between the number of ordinary shares issued and the number of ordinary
shares that would have been issued at the average market price of ordinary shares during the period shall
be treated as an issue of ordinary shares for no consideration” (CPA Canada, 2016, Accounting, IAS 33.45).

284

Earnings per Share

beginning of the reporting period, the diluted earnings per share calculation would include
these contingent shares in the denominator since the beginning of the reporting period.
If Ogdell Co. had agreed to issue 50 shares to any division manager who was able to
increase their respective divisional earnings by 10% in the current year, and three such
managers did in fact achieve the 10% increase, the diluted EPS calculation would include
150 (50 × 3 managers) additional shares.
The incremental shares for the options and the contingently issuable shares will be included in the diluted EPS schedule as denominator values as shown below:

As seen above, the net additional 693 shares (400 + 143 + 150) have resulted in a diluted
EPS of $0.95, or $0.01 less per share than the basic EPS of $0.96 (rounded). The dilutive
effect of the options and contingently issuable shares makes sense as only the number
of shares has increased with no effect on the income numerator. Mathematically, an
increasing denominator with an unchanged numerator will be the most dilutive and will be
listed first in the diluted EPS calculation, which is illustrated later in Step 3.
Step 2: Calculate the individual effect of each potentially dilutive convertible security and rank them from most to least dilutive.
Convertible debts, such as bonds and cumulative preferred shares that are convertible
into common shares, are potentially dilutive convertible securities. Unlike options, both
securities will affect not only the number of shares but also the net income. For example, if
bonds are converted into common shares, the number of shares will increase (denominator), and the interest expense saved due to the conversion of the debt to common shares
will increase the amount of income available to common shareholders (numerator).

19.2. Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share: A Review

285

If cumulative preferred shares are converted to common shares, the number of shares
will increase (denominator) and the dividends for the preferred shares saved, due to
the conversion to common shares, will increase the income available to the common
shareholders (numerator). Again, the assumption is that these outstanding convertible
securities would have converted to common shares since the beginning of the period,
using the if-converted method. For both types of securities, the income (numerator) and
number of shares (denominator) are affected, but are they dilutive? Two steps are needed
to determine this:

a. First, calculate the individual EPS effect on income (numerator) and number of
shares (denominator) for each type of convertible security. If the individual EPS
effect is less than the basic EPS calculated earlier, it is dilutive. If the individual EPS
effect is more than the basic EPS, it is anti-dilutive and can be excluded from the
subsequent calculations.
b. Second, rank the dilutive securities from most to least dilutive and complete the
diluted EPS calculation as shown in the example below.

For example, Ogdell Co. has the following convertible debt and equity securities:
Bonds payable, 3.2% annually, 20-year amortization, due 2035,
issued at par, each $1,000 bond is convertible into 30 common shares

400,000

Bonds payable, 2.5% annually, 15-year amortization, due 2030,
issued at par, each $1,000 bond is convertible into 23 common shares

300,000

Class A: $3 cumulative, convertible, preferred shares; authorized, 20,000
issued and outstanding, 10,000 shares, each share is convertible
into three common shares

800,000

Ogdell Co.’s income tax rate is 27%. Preferred dividends were not declared in the current
year.
Solution:
Calculate the individual EPS effect on income (numerator) and number of shares (denominator) for each type of convertible security and compare each to the basic EPS amount.
If the individual EPS effect for each security is less than the basic EPS, it is dilutive. If the
individual EPS is more than the basic EPS, it is anti-dilutive and can be excluded from the
subsequent calculations.

For the 3.2% convertible bonds, the calculation above assumes that interest will no longer
be paid if the bond is converted to common shares. The effect of the interest expense
savings on net income would be:

$400,000 × 3.2% per annum × (1 − 0.27) = $9,344 after-tax increase to net income
The increase in common shares if converted would be:

$400,000 ÷ $1,000 × 30 shares = 12,000 additional shares
The individual EPS effect compared to basic EPS would be:
$9,344 ÷ 12,000 shares = $0.7787 compared to basic EPS of $0.9556 and is, therefore,
dilutive. This security will be included in the overall diluted EPS calculation illustrated in
Step 3 below.
The same calculation is done for the 2.5% convertible bonds. The individual EPS effect
is $0.7935, which is less than the basic EPS of $0.9556, and is, therefore, dilutive.
For the convertible preferred shares, the calculation above assumes that the dividends will
no longer be paid if the preferred shares are converted into common shares. The effect

19.2. Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share: A Review

of the dividends saved will increase the net income available to common shareholders
because that portion of net income no longer has to be set aside, as done in the basic
EPS calculation illustrated earlier. Below is the calculation of the individual effects of the
preferred shares using the if-converted method:
10,000 shares × $3 dividends = $30,000 dividend savings, resulting in additional income
available to common shareholders. Note that there is no tax effect on dividends.
The increase in common shares if converted would be:

10,000 × 3 shares = 30,000 additional shares
The individual EPS effect compared to basic EPS would be:
$30,000 ÷ 30,000 shares = $1.00 which is more than the basic EPS of $0.9556 and is,
therefore, anti-dilutive. This security will be excluded from the diluted EPS calculation
illustrated in Step 3 below.
Both convertible bonds are dilutive and are ranked from most to lease dilutive as follows:
3.2% bonds

$0.7787

#2, ranked most dilutive after options and contingent shares

2.5% bonds

$0.7935

#3, ranked next most dilutive after options and contingent
shares

Step 3: Consolidating the results – complete a diluted EPS schedule and report the
results.
Starting with basic EPS, input each of the dilutive securities in ranked order starting
with options, warrants, and contingently issuable securities (which are the most dilutive).
Subtotal the diluted EPS calculation for each type of security to ensure that each continues to be dilutive when included in the overall diluted EPS calculation. Any securities that
are no longer contributing to the dilutive EPS are removed, and the remaining securities
are dilutive. This process is shown in the dilutive EPS schedule below:

Note that the dilutive EPS starts at $0.9536 because of the options and contingently
issuable shares. It subsequently decreases to $0.9476 for the next most dilutive 3.2%
convertible bonds, and finally it decreases once more to $0.9446 for the third-ranked
2.5% convertible bond. This means that each of the securities continues to contribute to
the dilutive EPS and should be kept in the schedule. As previously stated, and important
to remember, if any of the securities cause the diluted EPS subtotal to increase, it must
be removed from the calculation as it is no longer dilutive.
Carrying out these steps in the correct sequence is critical to ensure that the securities
reported as dilutive continue to have a dilutive effect throughout the entire diluted EPS
calculation.
The final diluted EPS amounts are disclosed on the face of the income statement and
rounded to the nearest two decimals:

19.3 Other Issues
Convertible securities and other dilutive instruments are not always outstanding throughout the entire current reporting period. They can also be issued or converted during the
current reporting period. These transactions can affect both basic and diluted EPS. Below
are some different examples of convertible securities and other issues that can have an
impact on the calculations for basic EPS or diluted EPS.
Type of Security and Description
of Transaction
Convertible security or option is issued during the
reporting period.

Convertible security or option is converted to
common shares during the reporting period.

Effect on EPS
Basic EPS: If the security is preferred shares, the
dividend entitlement (cumulative) or dividend
declared (non-cumulative) will be subtracted from
net income.
Diluted EPS: Income and shares effects are
prorated to reflect the duration from the issuance
date of the convertible security to the end of the
reporting period.
Basic EPS: The common shares issued will be
included in the WACS calculation from the date of
conversion to the end of the reporting period.
Diluted EPS: Income and shares effects are
prorated from the date that the security was
converted backwards to the beginning of the
reporting period. The shares issued for the actual
conversion are already included in the basic EPS
calculation.

290

Earnings per Share

Convertible security or option is either redeemed
or its conversion rights expire during the reporting
period.

Convertible security has more than one
conversion point in time.
Convertible security cannot be converted until
some future point in time.
Convertible debt such as bonds issued at a
discount or premium.
Options that are repurchased from option holders
by the company (of its own shares).
A company with a net loss from continuing
operations.

Basic EPS: There is no effect regarding the
redemption or expiration of conversion rights.
Diluted EPS: If dilutive, the income and shares
effects are prorated to reflect the duration from the
beginning of the reporting period to the
redemption or expiry date. For options, the shares
effect would be prorated for any period during the
current reporting period that they were in the
money.
Diluted EPS will be included in the diluted EPS
calculation using the most dilutive alternative.
Diluted EPS will be included in the diluted EPS
calculations, if dilutive.
Diluted EPS will use the effective interest method
to determine the income effect regarding the
income expense saved.
Diluted EPS will be excluded from the diluted EPS
because the company would not purchase the
options if it were not favourable for them to do so.
Diluted EPS will be equal to basic EPS because
the individual income and shares effects for the
diluted calculations will result in a reduction in the
net loss from continuing operations and will,
hence, be anti-dilutive.

$25 per share from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016
$27 per share from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018
Options expire on January 1, 2019
Contingent shares:
The company has an agreement with each of its five divisional managers to
issue 500 Class A common shares on January 1, 2017, if the manager’s
respective division before-tax earnings for 2015 increases by more than 10%
compared to the 2014 year-end reported before-tax earnings. To date,
divisional earnings for three managers have met and surpassed the
10% increase.

Additional information:

1. Earnings (net income) for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $690,000.
Included were discontinued operations of $210,000 loss, net of tax. Income tax
rate was 20%.
2. The average market price for Class A common shares was $21.
3. Dividends were paid on the preferred shares annually and no dividends were in
arrears.
4. On July 1, 2015, a 10% stock dividend was declared and issued to the Class A
common shareholders. At the beginning of the year, the total number of common
shares outstanding was 100,000.
5. On January 1, 2015, ten-year, 8% bonds, were issued at par for $600,000. Each
$1,000 bond is convertible into 50 Class A common shares commencing August
1, 2015. Using the residual value method, the liability component’s present value of
cash flows for interest and principal at a market rate of 9% for non-convertible bonds
was $561,494. The equity component was for the remainder of $38,506.
6. On August 1, 2015, $250,000 of the 8% convertible bonds were converted.

Basic Earnings per Share Calculation:
Step 1: Record the opening balance of shares outstanding and each subsequent event,
date, description, and number of shares for the current reporting. An event is where the
outstanding number of shares changes.
Step 2: For stock dividends or stock splits, apply the required retroactive restatement
factor(s) from the event point where it initially occurs and backwards to the beginning of
the fiscal year.

292

Earnings per Share

Step 3: For each event, complete the duration between events under the date column and
complete the corresponding fraction of the year column accordingly. Multiply the shares
outstanding times the retroactive restatement factor(s) times the fraction of the year for
each event. Sum the amounts to determine the WACS amount.

Note that income from continuing operations of $900,000, as shown above, was not given
in the question data. The amount must be derived by working backwards from the net
income amount of $690,000, after discontinued operations and net of tax, for $210,000. If
the discontinued operations had been stated in before-tax dollars, an additional calculation would be required to determine the net of tax amount, which is the amount deducted
from income from continuing operations to arrive at net income. There were no shares
issued in 2015 due to contingent shares. However, the contingent shares disclosed by
the company may be dilutive, which will be tested in the diluted EPS calculations in the
next section.

The employee stock options have an exercise price of $18 per share, compared to the
average market price of $21 per share. The options are in the money because the
exercise price is less than the average market price and option holders will be motivated
to exercise the options and purchase the common shares. As discussed previously, if the
options were not in the money, they would be excluded from the dilutive calculation.
The executive stock options are in the money at the exercise price of $20 per share, so
these will be included in the diluted EPS calculation as shown above.
Also, a portion of the contingently issuable shares is to be included in the dilutive calculation because three of the managers have already met the 10% increase.
Together, the options and contingently issuable shares are ranked number one, as the
most dilutive securities as a group.
Step 2: Calculate the individual effect of each potentially dilutive convertible security and rank them from most to least dilutive.

Note that the 7% bond is not convertible, so it is not dilutive. Also, a portion of the 8%
convertible bonds was converted on August 1. Note that the basic EPS included the
12,500 converted shares from August 1 to December 31, or for the five months remaining
after conversion. The diluted calculation for the interest saved and the additional shares
calculates the effect from the August 1 conversion date backwards to the beginning of
the year, or for seven months. The remainder of the 8% convertible bonds is calculated
backwards for the entire year, since they have not been converted.
Ranking the securities above from most to least dilutive results in the 8% converted bonds
being ranked number two most dilutive after options and contingently issuable shares.
The preferred shares are not dilutive at an individual EPS amount of $8.00 per share,
compared to the basic EPS of $6.94.
Step 3: Consolidating the results – complete a diluted EPS schedule and report the
results.

The dilutive securities are input into the schedule in ranked order from most to least
dilutive. A subtotal diluted EPS is calculated between each entry to ensure that each
security continues to contribute to the dilutive EPS. If any of the securities caused the
diluted EPS subtotal to increase, it must be removed from the calculation, as it is no
longer dilutive.
The final diluted EPS amounts are to be disclosed on the face of the income statement
and rounded to the nearest two decimals. However, as stated previously, companies
can choose to disclose the EPS for discontinued operations in the notes to the financial
statements. Below is an example of the disclosure on the face of the income statement:

Restatement of EPS
Examples of when EPS is to be retrospectively restated include when a prior period error
is discovered, when there is a change in accounting policy (voluntarily or in response
to a change in accounting standard), when a stock dividend/split is declared, or when a
subsequent event occurs. Subsequent events can occur after the fiscal year, but before
the financial statement have been issued. Examples include an issuance, conversion
or redemption of convertible securities, options or warrants, or a stock dividend or split
declared after the fiscal year but before the financial statements have been issued. Restatements require extensive disclosures, which are discussed in a later chapter.

19.5 Earnings per Share Analysis
Basic EPS is an indicator that uses historic financial data, such as net income, and
an average based on actual shares outstanding from the reporting period just ended.
Over time, EPS trends can help shareholders and potential investors to determine if
performance is on an upward or a downward swing. These trends can assist in forecasting
future performance based on what happened historically.
Diluted EPS is an indicator that is forward-looking. It quantifies the impact that exercising
options, and potentially convertible securities, will have on current earnings available to
common shareholders.
Price-earnings ratio (P/E) is an important measure of company’s performance. It measures how investors evaluate a company’s future performance and is calculated as:

Price-earnings ratio =

Market price per share
Earnings per share

If the market price for ABC Ltd. as at December 31, 2013, and 2014, was $43.29 and
$45.86, respectively. Using the EPS of $2.98 from the company’s financial statements,
the price-earnings ratios, using the market prices as high and low figures, are calculated
as follows:
Low:

$43.29
= 14.5
$2.98

High:

$45.86
= 15.39
$2.98

The P/E ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company to
receive one dollar of that company’s earnings. Therefore, the P/E is sometimes referred
to as the multiple, because it shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar

19.6. IFRS/ASPE Key Differences

297

of earnings. Using the figures from the calculations above, if a company was currently
trading at a multiple (P/E) of between 14.5 and 15.4, the interpretation is that an investor
would be willing to pay between $14 and $15 for $1 of current earnings.
In general, a high P/E ratio suggests that investors are expecting higher earnings growth in
the future compared to companies with a lower P/E. It could also mean that the company
is currently overvalued by the market, which may lead to a market correction of the stock
price in the future. Conversely, a low P/E ratio can indicate that a company may currently
be undervalued.
Like any other ratios or analytical tools, basic and diluted EPS and the price-earnings
ratio are not meaningful unless compared with something else, such as a company’s
historical trend. Also, EPS based on income from continuing operations is a more relevant
performance indicator and forecasting tool than EPS on net income, which may include
discontinued operations.
EPS as a single measure obscures important information about the company’s selection
of accounting policies, estimates, and valuations. As illustrated in the diluted EPS calculation above, the calculations for EPS are complex and can be manipulated like any other
analytical tool. For this reason, EPS should be only one assessment tool of many that
would comprise an informed analysis of a company’s performance and overall health.

Earnings per Share

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe earnings per share (EPS) and their role in accounting
and business.
Earnings per share measure how much income individual companies earn for each of its
common shareholders. EPS is a per share method of describing net income (earnings),
making EPS a good metric for investors. EPS is also a key metric used by stock market
analysts to measure if the reported EPS is higher or lower than the analysts’ forecasted
EPS. This movement affects the market price per share for this stock. Management can
reinvest profits in hopes of making more profits or they can pay a dividend or a share
buy-back to the investors to provide a return on the shareholders’ investment. EPS is the
metric used to determine the magnitude of this return.

LO 2: Describe basic and diluted earnings per share in terms of an
overview.
Basic EPS is a ratio that is calculated as net income available to common shareholders
after preferred shares dividends, if applicable, divided by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. A simple capital structure means that there are no debt
or equity securities convertible into common shares. If there are, the company is said
to have a complex capital structure. Diluted EPS is a worst-case scenario measurement
where the effect on earnings per share is measured assuming that all potential additional
common shares for convertible securities and options have already been issued. Publicly
traded companies must report earnings per share while companies that follow ASPE,
or companies that follow IFRS but are not publicly traded, do not. If the publicly traded
company has a complex capital structure, they must report both basic and diluted EPS on
the face of the income statement. EPS must also be broken down further to report EPS,
discontinued operations, net of tax, if applicable.
LO 2.1: Calculate basic earnings per share.
To calculate basic EPS, net income available to common shareholders after preferred
shares dividends is calculated for the numerator, and a weighted average number of
common shares outstanding is calculated for the denominator. For the numerator, only
net income, and not OCI, is relevant. The preferred shares dividends amount is subtracted from net income to determine the income available to common shareholders. The
cumulative preferred shares dividend amount is based on dividend entitlement while the
non-cumulative preferred shares dividends amount is based on dividend declared in the
current reporting period. For the denominator, the weighted average common shares

Chapter Summary

299

outstanding (WACS) is affected by common shares issued or repurchased as well as
any stock dividends and stock splits, both of which are restated retroactively back to the
beginning of the year. All these are further prorated by the number of months that they
have been outstanding during the year. There are three steps that, if followed, will simplify
this calculation.
LO 2.2: Calculate diluted earnings per share and report the final results.
Diluted EPS starts with the basic EPS numerator, denominator, and ratio. There are four
steps that, if followed, will simplify this calculation. In basic terms, options, warrants,
and contingent shares use the treasury stock method to determine their respective denominator amounts. For convertible securities such as convertible bonds and convertible
preferred shares, the if-converted method is used to determine both the income effect
(numerator) and the shares effect (denominator). All dilutive securities are, at this point,
ranked from most to least dilutive and the diluted EPS is calculated using a subtotal
between each security to ensure that each one continues to contribute a dilutive factor.
Any that do not are removed.
The final results of the basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations, discontinued
operations, and net income are disclosed. Basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations and net income must be disclosed on the face of the income statement while EPS
for discontinued operations can be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

LO 3: Describe the issues that can affect both basic and diluted
earnings per share.
There are several issues with regard to EPS. For example, convertible securities, options,
and warrants can be issued, converted, redeemed, or can expire during the reporting
period. Convertible securities can also have more than one conversion point, or may not
be convertible until sometime in the future. Also, convertible bonds can be issued at a
discount or at a premium, options can be repurchased from shareholders, or a company
may experience a net loss. All these factors may affect basic and diluted EPS.

LO 4: Calculate basic and diluted earnings per share in terms of a
comprehensive illustration.
A comprehensive step-by-step illustration is presented which applies the concepts as
summarized above.

300

Earnings per Share

LO 5: Identify and explain how earnings per share and
price-earnings ratio are used to analyze company performance from
an investor perspective.
Basic EPS uses historical data to be useful and relevant while diluted EPS is more
forward-looking and quantifies the impact that exercising options and potentially convertible securities has on current earnings available to common shareholders. Price-earnings
ratio is a percentage-based measure of company performance and is an indicator of
the share price that an investor can expect to pay to invest in the company. Ratios
must be comparable to something, such as historical trends or industry standards, to
be meaningful. As EPS is expressed as a single ratio figure it can obscure important
information about a company’s selection of accounting policies, estimates, and valuations.
Like any other ratio, EPS can be subject to manipulation and, therefore, should only be
one of a more comprehensive set of ratios and other types of analysis techniques used to
evaluate company performance.

LO 6: Explain the difference between ASPE and IFRS regarding
earnings per share.
ASPE companies and non-publicly traded IFRS companies are not required to report EPS
figures. However, publicly traded companies must report basic EPS and diluted EPS, if
applicable.

Statement of Cash Flows

The Importance of Cash Flow – For Better, For Worse, For Richer, For Poorer. . .
A business is a lot like a marriage. It takes work to make it succeed. One of the keys
to business success is managing and maintaining adequate cash flows. In the field of
financial management, there is an old saying that revenue is vanity, profits are sanity,
but cash is king. In other words, a firm’s revenues and profits may look spectacular,
but this does not guarantee there will be cash in the bank. Without cash, a business
cannot pay its bills and it will ultimately not survive.
Let’s take a look at the distinctions between revenue and profits, and cash, using a
numeric example for a new business:
Income Statement
Revenue*
$1,000,000
Cost of goods sold**
(500,000)
Gross profit
500,000
Operating expenses***
200,000
Net income/net profit
$ 300,000

Cash Flows
Revenue (cash received)
Cost of goods sold (paid in cash)
Net cash
Operating expenses (paid in cash)
Net cash

$ 400,000
(300,000)
100,000
90,000
$ 10,000

* Sales of $400,000 were paid in cash
** Purchases of $300,000 were paid in cash
*** Operating expenses of $90,000 were cash paid

Revenue is reported in the income statement as $1 million which is a sizeable amount,
but only $400,000 was cash paid by customers. (The rest is reported as accounts
receivable.) Gross profit is reported in the income statement as $500,000. This is also
a respectable number, but only $100,000 translates into a positive cash flow, because
some of the inventory purchases were paid in cash. (The rest of the inventory is
reported as accounts payable.) The company must still pay some of its operating
expenses, leaving only $10,000 cash in the bank.
When investors and creditors review the income statement, they will see $1 million in
revenue with gross profits of one-half million or 50%, and a respectable net income of
$300,000 or 30% of revenue. They could conclude that this looks pretty good for the
first year of operations and incorrectly assume that the company now has $300,000
available to spend.
307

308

Statement of Cash Flows

However, lurking deeper in the financial statements is the cash position of the
company–the amount of cash left over from this operating cycle. Sadly, there is only
$10,000 cash in the bank, so the company cannot even pay its remaining accounts
payable in the short term. So, how can management keep track of its cash?
The statement of cash flows is the definitive financial statement to bridge the gaps
between revenues and profits, and cash. Therefore, it is vital to understand the
statement of cash flows.

story about revenue and profits versus cash. As cash is generally viewed by many as
the most critical asset to success, this chapter will focus on how to correctly prepare and
interpret the statement of cash flows.

Statement of Cash Flows

20.1 Financial Reports: Overview
As discussed in previous chapters, shareholders, potential investors, and creditors use
published financial statements to assess a company’s overall financial health. Recall
how the five core financial statements link together into a cohesive network of financial
information. One of these links is the match between the ending cash balance reported
in the statement of cash flows (SCF) and the ending cash balance in the statement of
financial position (IFRS), or balance sheet (ASPE).
For example, below is the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015,
and the statement of financial position (SFP) for Wellbourn Services Ltd. at December 31,
2015.

Note how Wellbourn’s ending cash balance of $135,500, from the statement of cash flows
for the year ended December 31, matches the ending cash balance in the SFP on that
date. This is a critical relationship between these two financial statements. The SFP
provides information about a company’s resources (assets) at a specific point in time, and
whether these resources are financed mainly by debt (current and long-term liabilities) or
equity (shareholders’ equity). The statement of cash flows identifies how the company
utilized its cash inflows and outflows over the reporting period and, ultimately, ends with
its current cash and cash equivalents position at the statement of financial position date.

312

Statement of Cash Flows

As well, since the statement of cash flows is prepared on a cash basis, it excludes noncash accruals like depreciation and interest, making the statement of cash flows harder
to manipulate than the other financial statements.
Since the statement of cash flows separates cash flows into those resulting from ongoing
operating activities versus investing and financing activities, investors and creditors can
quickly see where the main sources of cash originate. If cash inflows are originating
mainly from operating activities, then this provides insight into a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to maintain its operations, pay its debts, and make new investments
without the need for external financing. If cash sources originate more from investing
activities, then this means that the company is likely selling off some of its assets to
cover its obligations. This may be appropriate if these assets are idle and are no longer
generating profit; otherwise it may suggest a downward spiral resulting in plummeting
profits. If cash sources are originating mainly from financing activities, then the company
is likely sourcing more cash from debt or from issuing shares (equity). Higher debt means
that more cash reserves are needed to make the principal and interest payments. Higher
equity means more shares issued and more dividends to be paid out, not to mention the
dilution of existing shareholders investments. Either scenario is cause for concern for both
shareholders and creditors.
Even if the majority of cash inflows are mainly from operating activities, if there is a large
difference between net income and the total cash inflows from operating activities then
that is a warning sign that shareholders and creditors should be digging deeper. This is
because a company’s quality of earnings, and hence its reliability, relates to how closely
reported net income corresponds to net cash flows. For example, if reported net income is
consistently close to, or less than, net cash operating activities, the company’s earnings
are considered to be high quality and, therefore, reliable. Conversely, if reported net
income is significantly more than net cash flows from operating activities, then reported
net income is not matched by a corresponding increase in cash, creating a need to
investigate the cause. After reviewing the statement of cash flows and the balance sheet,
the bottom line is: if debt is high and cash balances are low, the greater the risk of
business failure.
This chapter will explain how to prepare the statement of cash flows using either the direct
or indirect method, and how to interpret the results.

20.2 Statement of Cash Flows: Indirect Method Review
The statement of cash flows using the indirect method has been discussed in most
introductory accounting courses. Since the statement of cash flows can be challenging,
a review of the basic concepts is presented below.

20.2. Statement of Cash Flows: Indirect Method Review

313

The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to provide a means “to assess the enterprise’s capacity to generate cash and cash equivalents, and to enable users to compare
cash flows of different entities” (CPA Canada, 2016, Accounting, Part II, Section 1540.01
and IAS 7.4). This statement is an integral part of the financial statements for three
reasons. First, this statement helps readers to understand where these cash flows in
(out) originated from during the current year. This helps management, shareholders, and
creditors to assess a company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. Second, these
historic cash flows in (out) can be used to predict future company performance. Third, the
statement of cash flows can shed light on a company’s quality of earnings and if there may
be a disconnect between reported earnings and net cash flows from operating activities,
as explained earlier.
Two methods are used to prepare a statement of cash flows, namely the indirect method
and the direct method. The indirect method was discussed in previous accounting courses
and will be reviewed again in this chapter. The direct method introduced in this chapter
may be new for many students. Both methods organize the reported cash flows into three
activities: operating, investing, and financing. As discussed next, the difference between
the two methods occurs only in the first section for operating activities.
The indirect method reports cash flows from operating activities into categories such as:
• Net income/loss is reported.
• A series of adjustments to net income/loss for non-cash items are reported in the
income statement.
• Changes in each non-cash working capital account. The current portion of longterm debt, including lease obligations and dividends payable, are not considered
to be working capital accounts. They are included with their respective account to
which they relate. For example, the current portion of long-term debt or lease is
included with its related long-term liability account. Dividends payable is included
with its related retained earnings account.
The direct method reports cash flows from operating activities into categories based on
the nature of the cash flows, such as:
• cash received for sales
• cash paid for goods and services
• cash paid to or on behalf of employees
• cash received and paid for interest
• cash received and paid for dividends

314

Statement of Cash Flows

• cash paid for income taxes

The statement of cash flows above for Wellbourn Services Ltd. is an example of a statement using the direct method. Note that the operating section line items using the direct
method are based on the nature of the cash flows, whereas the indirect method line items
are based on their connections with the income statement and working capital accounts.
There are some similarities between the two methods. For instance, the net cash flows
from operating activities is the same for both methods, and the investing and financing
activities are identical for both methods as well.
Below is an example of the format using the indirect method. Note the connections to the
other financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

20.2.1 Differences Between IFRS and ASPE
There are differences in some of the reporting items between IFRS and ASPE. For
example, ASPE has mandatory disclosures as follows:

• cash dividends received and interest received or paid if reported in net income –
operating section
• interest or cash dividends debited to retained earnings – financing section
• Cash paid income taxes are often reported separately but it is not a reporting
requirement.

For IFRS, there are policy choices that, once made, should be applied consistently:

• interest received – choice of operating or investing section
• interest paid – choice of operating or financing section
• dividends received – choice of operating or investing section
• dividends paid – choice of operating or financing section
• cash paid income taxes – separately reported

For simplicity, this chapter will use the following norms for both IFRS and ASPE:

• interest received – operating section
• interest paid – operating section
• dividends received – operating section
• dividends paid – financing section
• income taxes paid – separately reported

As illustrated above, when using the indirect method, the sum of the non-cash adjustments to net income and changes to non-cash working capital accounts result in the
total cash flows in (out) from operating activities. The other two activities for investing and
financing follow. Any non-cash transactions occurring in the investing or financing sections
are not reported in a statement of cash flows. Instead, they are disclosed separately

20.2. Statement of Cash Flows: Indirect Method Review

317

in the notes to the financial statements. Examples of non-cash transactions would be
an exchange of property, plant, or equipment for common shares, or the conversion of
convertible bonds payable to common shares and stock dividends. If the transaction is a
mix of cash and non-cash, the cash-related portion of the transaction is reported in the
statement of cash flows with a note in financial statements detailing the non-cash and
cash elements. The final section of the statement reconciles the net change in cash flows
of the three activities, with the opening and closing cash and cash equivalents balances
taken from the balance sheet.

Additional information:

• The trading investment does not meet the criteria to be classified as a cash equivalent (see section 20.8 Specific Items for a discussion on cash equivalents) and no
purchases or sales took place in the current year.
• An examination of the intangible assets sub-ledger revealed that a patent had been
sold in the current year. The intangible assets have an indefinite life.
• No long-term investments were sold during the year.
• No buildings or patents were purchased during the year.
• There were no other additions to the long-term note payable during the year.
• Common shares were sold for cash. No other share transactions occurred during
the year.

Statement of Cash Flows

• Cash dividends were declared and paid.
• The note receivable maturity date is January 31, 2016, and was for a sale.

The statement of cash flows is the most complex statement to prepare. This is because
preparation of the entries requires analysis of multiple accounts. Moreover, the transactions resulting in cash inflows are to be differentiated from the transactions resulting in
cash outflows for each account. Preparing a statement of cash flows is made much easier
if specific sequential steps are followed. Below is a summary of those steps.

• Complete the statement headings.
• Operating activities section – record the net income/(loss).
• Adjust out any non-cash line items reported in the income statement to remove them
from the statement of cash flows. Examples of these are depreciation, amortization,
and most gains or losses such as gains/losses from the sale of assets, gain/loss
from redemption of debt, impairment losses, and fair value changes reported in net
income.
• Record the description and change amount for each non-cash working capital account (current assets and current liabilities) except for the current portion of longterm debt line item since it is not a working capital account. Subtotal the operating
activities section.
• Investment activities section – using T-accounts or other techniques, determine the
change for each non-current (long-term) asset account. Analyze and determine the
reason for the change(s). Record the reason and change amount(s) as cash inflows
or outflows.
• Financing activities section – add back to long-term debt any current portion identified in the SFP/BS for both years, if any. Using T-accounts, or other techniques,
determine the change for each non-current (long-term) liability and equity account.
Analyze and determine the reason for the change(s). Record the reason and change
amount(s) as cash inflows or outflows. One anomaly occurs with pension benefit
liability. This liability is non-current, but it is not a financing activity as its nature is to
benefit employees. For this reason, any change in funding for the pension liability,
even though classified as non-current, is to be reported in operating activities.
• Subtotal the three sections. Record the opening and closing cash, including cash
equivalents, if any. Reconcile the opening balance plus the subtotal from the three
sections to the closing balance to ensure that the accounts balance correctly.
• Complete any required disclosures.

items such as depreciation, depletion, amortization, and gains or losses (such as with the
sale or disposal of assets). In this case, there are two non-cash items to adjust from net
income. Record them as adjustments to net income in the statement of cash flows.
Step 4. Current assets and liabilities:
Calculate and record the change between the opening and closing balances for each noncash working capital account as shown below (with the exception of the current portion
of long-term notes payable, which is netted with its respective long-term notes payable
account) as shown below:

Accounting Equation:
A = L + E MUST ALWAYS BALANCE!
77,000
43,000
(5,000)

Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Cash + (all other) Assets = Liabilities + Equity

(2,000)
(84,510)
3,550 Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
(58,970)
(3,450)
143,000 Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
(8,400)
(5,880)
(200,000) Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
(101,660)

Cash inflows to the company are reported as positive numbers while cash outflows are
reported as negative numbers using brackets. How does one determine if the amount
is a positive or a negative number? A simple tool is to use the accounting equation to
determine whether cash is increasing as a positive number or decreasing as a negative
number. Recall the accounting equation:

Assets = Liabilities + Equity
This must always remain in balance. This equation can be applied when analyzing the
various accounts to record the changes. For example, accounts receivable has increased

324

Statement of Cash Flows

from $165,000 to $249,510 for a total increase of $84,510. Using the accounting equation,
this can be expressed as:

A= L+E
Expanding the equation a bit:
Cash + accounts receivable + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity

If accounts receivable INCREASES by $84,510, then this can be expressed as a black
up-arrow above the account in the equation:

Cash + accounts receivable + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity

Holding everything in the equation constant, except for cash, if accounts receivable INCREASES, then the effect on the cash account must have a corresponding DECREASE
in order to keep the equation balanced:

Cash + accounts receivable + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity

If cash DECREASES, then it is a cash outflow and the number must be negative with
brackets as shown in the statement above.
Conversely, when analyzing liability or equity accounts, the same technique can be used.
For example, an increase in account payable (liability) of $143,000 will affect the equation
as follows:
Cash + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity

Again, holding everything else constant except for cash, if accounts payable INCREASES
as shown by the black up-arrow above, then cash must also INCREASE by a corresponding amount in order to keep the equation in balance.

Cash + all other assets = Liabilities + Equity

20.2. Statement of Cash Flows: Indirect Method Review

325

If cash INCREASES, then it is a cash inflow and the number will be positive with no
brackets as shown in the statement above.
Step 5. Non-current asset changes:
The next section to complete is the investing activities section. The analysis of all of the
non-current assets accounts must also take into account whether there have been any
current year purchases, disposals, or adjustments as part of the analysis. The use of Taccounts for this type of analysis provides a useful visual tool to help understand whether
the changes that occurred in the account are cash inflows or outflows, as shown below.
Cash flows from investing activities
Purchase of HTM investments
Sales proceeds from sale of building
Sales proceeds from sale of patent

Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity

There are four non-current asset accounts: long-term investments, land, buildings, and
intangible assets. The land account had no change, as there were no purchases or sales
of land. Analyzing the investment account results in the following cash flows:

Long-term investment

Additional information in note #3 above stated that there were no sales of long-term investments during
the year, the entry would have been for a purchase:

Cash paid for the investment was therefore $30,750.

Analysis of the buildings account is a bit more complex because of the effects of the
contra account for accumulated depreciation. In this case, the buildings account, and its

326

Statement of Cash Flows

contra account, must be merged together since the SFP/BS reports only the net carrying
amount. Analyzing the buildings account results in the following cash flows:

Building (net of accum. depr.)

43,000
50,000
232,000

current year accum. Depr.

Additional information note # 4 states that no buildings were purchased so the balancing amount of
$50,000 must be for a sale of a building.
Since there was a gain from the sale of buildings, the entry would have been:

Cash proceeds were therefore $55,000.

The sale of the patent is straightforward since there were no other sales, purchases, or
amortization in the current year (as stated in steps 2 and 4).

There are five long-term liability and equity accounts: long-term notes payable, preferred shares, common shares, contributed surplus, and retained earnings. The preferred shares and contributed surplus accounts had no changes to report. Note that just
because an account balance has no change during the year, this does not necessarily
mean that there were no transactions. For example, old shares could be retired and new

20.2. Statement of Cash Flows: Indirect Method Review

327

shares issued for the same face value. These transactions would need to be reported in
the cash flow statement, even though the net change in the account is zero.
Analyzing the long-term notes payable account results in the following cash flows:

Long-term note payable
325,000
19,000
306,000

the sum of both the current and long-term amounts
X = repayment
the sum of both the current and long-term amounts

Cash paid was therefore $19,000.

Note how the current portion of long-term debt has been included in the analysis of the
long-term note payable. The current portion line item is a reporting requirement relating
to the principal amount owing one year after the reporting date. As it is not actually a
working capital account, it is omitted from the operating section and included with its
corresponding long-term liability account in the financing activities. For example, the
opening balance of $325,000 above is the sum of the current portion ($45,000) plus the
long-term portion ($280,000). Similarly, the ending balance of $306,000 is the sum of the
current portion ($60,000) plus the long-term portion ($246,000).
The common shares and retained earnings accounts are straightforward and the analysis
of each is shown below.

Step 7. Subtotal and reconcile:
The three activities total a net increase in cash of $57,500. When added to the opening
cash balance of $250,000, the resulting total of $307,500 is equal to the ending cash
balance for the year ending December 31, 2015. This can be seen in the completed
statement of cash flows following step 8.
Step 8. Required disclosures:
The statement of cash flows using the indirect method must separately disclose the cash
flows for:
• Interest paid

20.2. Statement of Cash Flows: Indirect Method Review

329

• Interest received
• Dividends received (dividends paid are reported in the financing section)
• Cash paid income taxes
• Non-cash transactions that may have occurred in the current year.

If not too lengthy, these items can be disclosed in the notes or at the bottom of the
statement. The cash received for dividend income and interest income was taken directly
from the income statement since no accrual accounts exist on the balance sheet for these
items. Cash paid for interest charges and income taxes are calculated on the basis of
an analysis of their respective liability accounts from the balance sheet and expense
accounts from the income statement.
Below is the completed statement of cash flows using the indirect method with required
disclosures for Watson Ltd., for the year ending December 31, 2015:

20.3. Statement of Cash Flows: Direct Method

331

20.3 Statement of Cash Flows: Direct Method
As mentioned earlier, the only difference when applying the direct method, as opposed
to the indirect method, is in the operating activities section; the investing and financing
sections are prepared exactly the same way. Typical reporting categories in the operating
section for the direct method include:

• Cash received from sales
• Cash paid for goods and services
• Cash paid to, or on behalf of, employees
• Cash received for interest income
• Cash paid for interest
• Cash paid for income taxes
• Cash received for dividends

Recall that the categories above are based on the nature of the cash flows. Whereas with
the indirect method the cash flows are based on the income statement and changes in
each non-cash working capital (current) asset and liability account. Below is a comparison
of the two methods:
Indirect Method

$$
Net cash flows from operating activities

$$

The direct method is straightforward due to the grouping of information by nature. This
also makes interpretation of the statement more intuitive for stakeholders. However, companies record thousands of transactions every year and many of them do not involve cash.
Since the accounting records are kept on an accrual basis, it can be a time-consuming and

332

Statement of Cash Flows

expensive task to separate and collect the cash-only data required for the direct method
categories by nature. Also, providing disclosures about sensitive information, such as
cash receipts from customers and cash payments to suppliers, is not in the best interest
of the company. For these reasons, many companies prefer not to use the direct method.
Instead, the indirect method may be easier to prepare because it collects much of its data
directly from the existing income statement and balance sheet. However, it is less intuitive
as evidenced by the accounts-based categories above.

20.3.1 Preparing a Statement of Cash Flows: Direct Method
As with the indirect method, preparing a statement of cash flows using the direct method
is made much easier if specific steps are followed in sequence. Below is a summary of
those steps to complete the operating section of the statement of cash flows using the
direct method:
Direct Method Steps:
• Complete the headings and categories section of the operating activities. The
example below includes seven categories based on the nature of the revenue and
expenses.
• Create three additional columns: Income Statement (I/S) Accounts, Changes to
Working Capital (WC), and Accounts and Net Cash Flows In (Out).
• Starting with the top of the income statement, record each income statement line
item amount to the most appropriate direct method category in the I/S Accounts
column. These would include sales, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, nonoperating revenue, and various expenses items. Any non-cash items are also recorded,
but only as memo items in the column. Examples of these would be depreciation,
amortization, and most gains or losses. Such as gains or losses from the sale of
assets, gains or losses from the redemption of debt, impairment losses, and from
fair value changes reported in net income. The I/S Accounts column total must be
equal to net income.
• Under the Changes to Working Capital Accounts, record the net change amount
for each non-cash working capital account (current assets and current liabilities)
except for the “current portion of long term debt” line item. As it is not a working
capital account, it is added back to its corresponding long-term liability. Also, record
as an adjustment any additional non-cash items found in net income arising from the
analysis of the non-current asset, liability, and equity accounts. The obvious noncash items were recorded as memo items only in Step 3, but other non-cash items
can be uncovered when analyzing the non-current assets, liabilities, and equity
accounts. When these are discovered, they must be recorded as an adjustment
to net income in this column.

20.3. Statement of Cash Flows: Direct Method

333

• Under the Net Cash Flows In (Out), calculate the net cash flows amount for each
direct method category.
• Calculate the subtotal of the operating activities section and transfer the information
to the statement of cash flows operating activities section.

Using the financial statements from Watson Ltd. presented previously, we will apply the
steps below:

Statement of Cash Flows

Note how items 13 and 17 on the operating activities statement, regarding the trading
investments, cancel each other out. This is because the interest income from the trading
investment was accrued and not actually received in cash.
In this simple example, no adjustments to net income resulting from analysis of noncurrent assets, liabilities, and equity are identified. However, this situation will be illustrated in the comprehensive example later in this chapter.
The change in each working capital account can be a positive or a negative cash flow
(using brackets). To ensure that the cash flow is correctly identified as positive or negative,
apply the principles using the accounting equation explained earlier:
Cash + Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Refer to the earlier section in this chapter for more details regarding this technique.
Step 5 and Step 6. Calculate the net cash flows amount for each category and
calculate the subtotal for the operating activities section (transfer the information
to the statement of cash flows):

The cash received for interest income of zero dollars was included in the direct method example for illustrative purposes only.
This line item would normally be removed when preparing the actual statement of cash flows. Also, additional disclosures
for interest, dividends, and income taxes discussed previously are required when using the indirect method. With the
direct method, these additional disclosures are not required as they are already reported as cash-paid line items within the
statement (as shown in the example above).

20.4. Interpreting the Results

339

a hasty conclusion could be drawn that all is well with Watson Ltd., as their bottom line
is a positive cash flow. However, there is, in fact, trouble ahead for this company. We
know this because the operating activities section, which represents the reason for being
in business, is in a negative cash flow position. In other words, a company is expected to
earn a profit, resulting in positive cash flows reflected in the operating activities section.
However, in this case there is a negative cash flow of $101,660 from operating activities.
Why?
For Watson Ltd., both the accounts receivable and inventory have increased, resulting in
a net decrease in cash of $143,480. An increase in accounts receivable may mean that
sales have occurred but the collections are not keeping pace with the sales on account.
An increase in inventory may be because there have not been enough sales in the current
year to cycle the inventory from current asset, to sales/profit, and, ultimately, to cash.
However, the risk of holding large amounts of inventory is the increased possibility that
the inventory will become obsolete, damaged, and unsellable.
In this example, an additional reason for decreased net cash from operating activities is
due to a decrease in unearned revenue. Recall that unearned revenue is cash received
from customers in advance of the company providing the goods and services. In this
case, the cash would have been reported as a positive cash flow in the operating activities
section in the previous reporting period when the cash was actually received. At that time,
the cash generated from operating activities would have increased by the amount of cash
received for the unearned revenue. The entry upon receipt of the cash would have been:

Unearned revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

PR

Debit

Credit

When the company finally provides the goods and services to the customer, the net
income reported at the top of the operating activities section will reflect the portion of
the unearned revenue that has now been earned. However, the company did not obtain
actual cash for this revenue in this reporting period since the cash was received in the
prior reporting period. Keep in mind that unearned revenue is not normally an obligation
that must be paid in cash to the customer, and getting customers to pay in advance is
always a good cash management strategy. That said, once the goods and services are
provided to the customer, the obligation ceases.
Listed in the investing activities section, there was a sale of a building and a purchase
of a long-term investment in Held to Maturity (HTM) Investments. The sales proceeds
from the building may have been partially invested in the HTM to make a return on the
cash proceeds until it can be used in the future for its intended purpose. However, more
analysis would be required to confirm whether this was the case. The sale of the patent
also generated a positive cash flow. There was no gain on the sale of the patent reported

340

Statement of Cash Flows

in the income statement, so the sales proceeds did not exceed its carrying value at the
time it was sold. Ideally, the patent would not have been sold in a panic, in an effort to raise
immediate additional cash at the expense of future cash flows it could have generated.
Looking at the financing activities section, it is clear that the majority of cash inflows for this
reporting period resulted from the issuance of additional common shares worth $182,200.
This represents an increase in the share capital of more than 25%. Increased shares
will have a negative impact on the earnings per share, and possibly the market price
as well, which may give investors pause. The shareholders were also paid dividends of
$42,590, but this amount only just covers the preferred shareholders dividend of $30,000
(15,000 × $2) plus its share of the participating dividend. This leaves very little dividends
for the common shareholders, a situation likely to cause concern among the common
shareholder investors, made worse by the dilution of their holdings due to the large
issuance of additional shares.
When looking at the opening and closing cash balances for Watson Ltd., they seem like
sizeable amounts. However, we must look at where the cash originated from. In this case,
the $250,000 opening balance was due almost entirely to the $225,000 unearned revenue
received in advance, which is not an ongoing source of capital. The ending cash balance
of $307,500 was due to the issuance of additional share capital of $182,200 (a one-time
transaction), plus an increase in accounts payable of $143,000 that will eventually have
to be repaid. Consider also that during the year, the cash from the unearned revenues
was being consumed and the issuance of the additional capital had not yet occurred. It
would be no surprise, then, if cash at the mid-year point was insufficient to cover even the
current liabilities, hence the increase in accounts payable and, ultimately, the issuance of
additional capital shares.
In summary, Watson Ltd. is currently unable to generate positive cash flows from its
operating activities. The unearned revenue of $225,000 at the start of the year added
some needed cash early on, but this reserve was depleted by the end of the reporting
year. In the meantime, without a significant change in how the company manages its
inventory and receivables, Watson Ltd. may continue to experience a shortage of cash
from its operating activities. To compensate, it may continue to sell off assets, issue
more shares, or incur more long-term debt in order to obtain the needed cash. In any
case, these sources will eventually dry up when investors are no longer willing to invest,
creditors are no longer willing to extend loans, and no assets remain worth selling. Watson
Ltd.’s current negative cash position from operating activities is unsustainable and must
be turned around quickly for the company to remain a going concern.

20.5. Disclosures

341

20.5 Disclosures
Throughout this chapter, various disclosures have been discussed. Below is a summary
of the main required disclosures:

• The change in cash (including cash equivalents) must be explained.
• The components of cash and cash equivalents must be disclosed as well as the
company policy used to determine its composition.
• Cash flows are to be classified as either from operating, investing, or financing
activities.
• Cash flows from operating activities can be reported using the indirect or direct
method.
• Cash flows from interest received or paid, dividends received or paid (IFRS and
ASPE), and income taxes paid (IFRS) are to be reported separately, either within
the statement of cash flows or as a supplemental disclosure.
• Major classes of cash flows in and out within the investing and financing section are
to be separately reported.
• Non-cash transactions are excluded from the statement of cash flows but must be
disclosed as a supplemental disclosure.

20.6 Analysis
Ratio Analysis – Overview
Ratio analysis occurs when relationships between selected financial data (presented in
the numerator and denominator of the formula) provide key information about a company.
Ratios from current year financial statements alone may not be as useful as when they
are compared with benchmark ratios. Examples of benchmark ratios are a company’s
own historical ratio trends, future ratio targets set by management as part of its strategic
plan, industry sector ratios from the sector that the company operates in, or ratios from
competitors, if obtainable.
Care must be taken when interpreting ratios because companies within an industry sector
may use different accounting policies, which affect the comparison of ratios. In the end,
ratios are based on a company’s current and past performance and are merely indicators.

342

Statement of Cash Flows

Further investigation is needed to gather more business intelligence about the reasons
why certain variances in the ratios occur.
Statement of Cash Flows Analysis
Not all companies who report profits are financially stable. This is because profits do
not necessarily translate to cash. Looking at the statement of cash flows for Watson Ltd.
above, we see that it reported a $77,000 net income (profit), but it is currently experiencing
significant negative cash flows from its operating activities.
As previously discussed, one of the most important aspects of the statement of cash flows
is the cash flows generated from the operating activities, as this reflects the business’s
day-to-day operations. If sufficient cash is generated from operating activities, then the
company will not have to increase its debt, issue shares, or sell off useful assets to pay
its bills. However, as we saw the opposite was true for Watson Ltd. as it increased its
short-term debt (accounts payable), sold off a building, and issued 25% more common
shares.
Another critical aspect is the sustainability of positive cash flows from operating activities.
Perhaps Watson Ltd.’s negative cash flow from operating activities will turn itself around
in the next reporting period, as this would be the company’s best hope. Other companies
who experience positive cash flows from operations must also ensure that it is sustainable
and can be repeated consistently in the future.
In summary, it is critical to monitor the trends regarding cash flows over time. Without
benchmarks, such as historical trends or industry standards, ratio analysis is not as
useful. If trends are tracked, ratio analysis can be a powerful tool to evaluate a company’s
cash flows.
Statement of Cash Flows Ratios
Below are some of the cash flows ratios currently used in business.

20.7. Comprehensive Example: Both Methods

343

For Watson Ltd., since the net cash flow from operating activities is a loss of $101,660,
the two ratios above would be unfavourable. For example, the current cash debt coverage
ratio would be a negative 26.4% ($101,660 loss ÷ $384,720) and the cash debt coverage
ratio would be a negative 16.1% ($101,660 loss ÷$630,720). Without the historical trends
for these ratios, it is impossible to say if Watson Ltd. can turn things around or not.
Free Cash Flow (FCF) Analysis
Another way to assess a company’s cash flow liquidity is the free cash flow. Free cash flow
is the cash flow remaining from operating activities after deducting cash spent on capital
expenditures, such as purchasing property, plant and equipment. Some companies also
deduct cash paid dividends. The remaining cash flow represents cash available to the
company to do other things such as expand its operations, pay off long-term debt or
reduce the number of outstanding shares. Below is the calculation using the data from
Watson Ltd.’s statement of cash flows.

Cash flow provided by operating activities $(101,660)

$(144,250)

It is no surprise that Watson Ltd. has no free cash flow and no financial flexibility, since its
operating activities are in a negative position. Watson Ltd. met its current year dividend
cash requirements by selling more common shares to raise additional cash, thus diluting
the shareholders’ investment position. When calculating the free cash flow, the capital
expenditures amount should be limited to those that relate to daily operations that are
intended to sustain ongoing operations, such as PPE expenditures. Meaning, capital
expenditures purchased as investments are usually excluded from the free cash flow
analysis.

20.7 Comprehensive Example: Both Methods
The example below will incorporate some different transactions that were discussed earlier in this course, or the prerequisite courses. These include more complex transactions
such as long-term investments such as Available for Sale investments, long-term liabilities
such as accrued pension liabilities, deferred income taxes payable or bonds issued at a
discount and equity items such as convertible securities, stock options and re-acquisition
and retirement of shares.

Statement of Cash Flows

Additional information:

• Issued additional 7.2%, $500,000, 10-year bonds payable for cash of $452,000.
• Cash dividends were declared and paid.
• An AFS investment (OCI) was sold for $50,000 cash on January 2, 2015. Its original
cost was $47,000 and had a carrying value of $50,000 (fair value) at the time of the
sale. All unrealized gains previously recorded to OCI/AOCI for the sold investment
were reclassified to net income. AFS investments of $76,000 were purchased for
cash.
• There is a stock option plan for senior executives. In 2015, stock options with a book
value of $15,000 were exchanged for common shares, along with $40,000 in cash.
The remaining increase in the stock options account is due to the compensation
expense included in the income statement as salaries and benefits.
• The six percent convertible bond payable was converted into common shares at the
beginning of 2015.
• Land was acquired for cash.
• Machinery, with an original cost of $100,000 and a net book value of $20,000, was
sold at a loss of $15,000. Additional machinery for other activities was acquired in
exchange for common shares.
• Common shares with an average original issue price of $430,000 were retired for
$485,000.
• The accrued pension benefit liability was increased by $20,000, due to an actuarial revaluation, and $10,000, because of the difference between funding and the
pension expense.
• The company’s policy is to report dividends received, interest received, and interest
paid as operating activities, and dividends paid as financing activities.

20.7. Comprehensive Example: Both Methods

20.7.1 Preparing the Statement of Cash Flows: Indirect Method
Indirect Method Steps:

1. Headings
2. Record net income/(loss)
3. Adjust out non-cash items from the income statement
4. Current assets and current liabilities changes
5. Non-current asset accounts changes
6. Non-current liabilities and equity accounts changes
7. Subtotal and reconcile
8. Disclosures

Following the steps listed above, prepare a statement of cash flows using the indirect
method. Details are provided below for each step, followed by the completed statement
of cash flows.
Notes to the Solutions and Details About Calculations:
Step 1. Headings:
Insert headings and subheadings, leaving spaces within each section to record the relevant line items resulting from the subsequent steps.
Step 2. Record net income/(loss):
Net income (and not comprehensive income) is the starting point for a statement of cash
flows with the indirect method. Comprehensive income will become relevant if any of the
AFS investments are actually sold. Recall that upon sale, any unrealized gains or losses
previously recorded to OCI will be realized and moved to retained earnings from AOCI.
Step 3. Adjustments:
When reviewing the income statement, non-cash items for depreciation, loss on sale of
machinery, and realized gain on sale of AFS investments are reported. However, since
this is a more complex example, there could be other hidden non-cash items that will

348

Statement of Cash Flows

become apparent when analyzing the non-current asset, liability, and equity accounts.
Leave some space in this section in case other non-cash items are discovered in the
accounts analysis.
Step 4. Current assets and liabilities:
Continue to use the accounting equation, A = L + E, to determine if the change amount
for each non-cash working capital account is a positive number or a negative number
(requiring a bracket).
Step 5. Non-current asset changes:
Analyze all the non-current asset accounts to determine the reasons for the changes
in the accounts. Additional information taken from the various accounting records has
been provided. Items 3, 6, and 7 pertain to non-current assets so this information will be
incorporated into the step 5 analysis.

a. AFS investment (OCI):

remove realized gain on sale

Additional information in note # 3 states that $50,000 of AFS investments (fair value =
carrying value) was sold for $50,000 cash, so there’s no gain or loss on the actual sale.
However, the original cost was $47,000, so there is an accumulated unrealized gain of $3,000
($50,000 fair value − $47,000 original cost) for the sold investment that was reclassified from
OCI/AOCI to net income. This is confirmed by reviewing the income statement. This non-cash
entry has already been adjusted in operating activities in Step 3, so no further action is required.

Note # 3 also states that there was also a cash paid investment of $76,000.
The T-account requires another debit for $44,000 to balance properly. This must be for fair
value changes and that is confirmed by reviewing the comprehensive income statement. This
non-cash entry is not included in the income statement so no further action is necessary.

Analysis result: enter the cash amounts for the sale ($50,000) and the purchase of
AFS investments ($76,000) highlighted in red in the investing activities section of the
statement of cash flows.
b. Land:

Additional information in note # 6 states that land was purchased for cash.
There is no other information about the land account so the balancing amount of $180,000 must
be the purchase price of the land.

Additional information note # 7 states that there was a loss from the sale of machinery of $15,000
that originally cost $100,000. The carrying value at the time of the sale was $20,000. The cash
amount for the sale would therefore be $5,000 ($20,000 carrying value − $15,000 loss). The
accumulated depreciation for the sold machinery would be $80,000 ($100,000 original cost −
$20,000 carrying cost).

Accumulated depreciation requires another $43,000 credit to balance properly. This must be for
the current year depreciation expense and that is confirmed by reviewing the income statement.
This non-cash entry has already been adjusted in operating activities in Step 3, so no further
action is required.
Note # 7 also stated that additional machinery was purchased in exchange for common shares.
The balancing amount of $300,000 would account for this non-cash transaction which is not
included in the SCF except as a supplemental disclosure required for non-cash items.

Analysis result: enter the cash amount for the sale of machinery ($5,000) highlighted
in red in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.

Step 6. Non-current liabilities and equity changes:
Analyze all the non-current liability and equity accounts to determine the reasons for
the changes in the accounts. Additional information taken from the various accounting
records has been provided. Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9 pertain to non-current liabilities and
equity so this information will be incorporated into the step 6 analysis.

The balancing amount of $1,000 must therefore be for amortization of the discount which will be
included in net income as part of interest expense of $30,000. This $1,000 non-cash amount
should be adjusted from net income in operating activities because it was not done in Step 3.

Analysis result: enter the cash amount for the bond issuance ($452,000) and adjust
the $1,000 amortization expense highlighted in red in the financing activities section
of the statement of cash flows.
f. Deferred income tax payable:

There is no additional information regarding this account. The balancing amount of $12,000
must be for a deferred income tax recovery which is confirmed by a review of the income
statement. This non-cash entry was included in net income but not adjusted in Step 3, so it
should be adjusted in the operating section now.

Analysis result: enter the non-cash amount for the deferred tax recovery ($12,000)
highlighted in red in the operating activities section as an adjustment to net income.

so it will be omitted from the SCF.

?? (greater by $10,000)

The pension expense amount is not known but the funding (cash) amount is known to be greater
than the pension expense by $10,000. Even though this is a non-current liability, it’s purpose
is to benefit employees and not as a source of financing cash flow. For this reason, it is more
appropriate to record this non-current liability reduction as an operating activity instead of a
financing activity.

Analysis result: enter the cash difference amount ($10,000) highlighted in red as an
operating activity item for the reduction in the pension liability.

It is now evident that $27,000 of the compensation expense included in net income in salaries

should therefore be adjusted out of net income in operational activities now.

We will once again use the comprehensive illustration above for Ace Ltd. to demonstrate
the completion of the operating activities section using the direct method. The first example explained below demonstrates how to prepare a direct method statement on its own.
The second example demonstrates a quick technique to convert an already prepared
indirect statement of cash flows into a direct method format.
Direct Method Steps:

1. Headings and categories
2. Three additional columns
3. Record each income statement reporting line amount to its respective
direct method category under the Income Statement Accounts column.
Non-cash items are shown as memo items only.
4. Record the net change amount for each non-cash working capital account.
Also record any adjustment amounts resulting from the analysis of noncurrent accounts from the investing or financing sections (highlighted in
blue below).
5. Calculate the net cash flow amount for each category.
6. Calculate the subtotal for the operating activities section.

Step 6

In this example, steps 1 and 2 are self-explanatory. Steps 3, 4, and 5 are represented
by entries in each of the columns in the schedule above. Note that this example is more
complex as some non-cash costs were embedded with other income statement expenses
initially treated as cash items and left unadjusted. There was also a reduction in the noncurrent pension liability which was more appropriately reported as an operating activity.
These items were discovered when the analysis of the non-current assets (investing
activities), liabilities and equity (financing activities) were completed. As a result, there
are four additional adjusting entries (e, f, g and h) that must be adjusted in Step 4 of the
operating section above (highlighted in blue).

20.8 Specific Items
The comprehensive illustration above included many of the more complex accounting
transactions from the intermediate accounting courses (e.g., investments involving OCI,
bonds issued at a discount, conversion of bonds to shares, deferred income taxes, ex-

20.8. Specific Items

359

ercising stock options, and accrued pension liabilities with funding changes). Below,
however, is a brief discussion of further items to consider:

• Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily
convertible to cash and carry little risk. Treasury bills, and term deposits that mature
within 90 days, are examples of financial instruments that meet these two criteria
and, thus, can be treated as a cash equivalent and added to cash for purposes of a
statement of cash flows. Other instruments, such as publicly traded stocks, do not
meet both criteria. While they may be easily traded, they carry significant risk due
to market price fluctuations. For this reason, they cannot be classified as a cash
equivalent. However, companies can choose whether to include cash equivalents
with cash when preparing a SCF. If they do not include them with cash, then they
are to be treated the same as the other working capital accounts. In which case, the
accounting policy is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are treated as one reporting line item in a
SCF. This means that changes between them are netted and are, therefore, not
itemized. Simply speaking, the cash and cash equivalents accounts are added
together and reported as a single amount for both the opening and closing balance.
• Restricted cash or cash equivalents
These are to be reported separately in the SCF.
• Bank overdrafts
Bank overdrafts are generally included in the opening and closing cash balances,
provided that they are an integral part of the overall cash management for the
company. However, depending on local practice or other conditions, they may be
excluded. Line of credit accounts that are payable on demand are examples of
accounts that would be netted with cash.
• Discontinued operations
The SCF begins with income before discontinued operations. Items from discontinued operations are shown separately in the operating, investing, or financing
activities according to their nature. For companies following IFRS, they can also
disclose cash flow information about discontinued operations in the notes to the
financial statements.
• Impairments of identifiable tangible or intangible assets
Any impairment write-downs reported in net income are adjusted out of net income
in the operating activities as non-cash items. This is also the case with impairment
reversals.
• Investments in associates

360

Statement of Cash Flows

The accounting treatment for investments in associates was discussed in the previous accounting courses. Companies that follow IFRS account for these investments
using the equity method. With ASPE, a policy choice allows either the equity method
or fair value through net income or cost, depending upon the type of investment.
Since the SCF reports cash flows, the cash dividend income received would be
included in the SCF. Any investment income accrued, or unrealized gains or losses
included in net income, must be adjusted out of net income as a non-cash item in
operating activities.
• Comprehensive income
As discussed earlier in the chapter, only net income is relevant with regard to the
SCF. Comprehensive income items are excluded since they are non-cash items. For
example, investments classified as “available for sale,” have fair value adjustments
every reporting period which are recorded to OCI rather than to net income. It is only
when an AFS investment is sold that its respective accumulated unrealized gains are
reclassified from OCI/AOCI to net income. When this occurs, an adjustment to net
income is required in operating activities, since the gain or loss on the sale of the
AFS investment is a non-cash item, the same way that a gain or loss on the sale of
a building or an equipment asset is a non-cash item.
• Liabilities
Netting old and new debt in the SCF is not permitted and each individual debt
instrument is to be individually reported. Amortization of a discount or premium is
a non-cash component of interest expense, and since interest expense is reported
in net income, amortization amounts are adjusted out of net income in operating
activities.
• Leases
The increase in assets and liabilities due to a new finance lease is treated as a noncash transaction and is excluded from the SCF, although supplementary disclosures
are required. Cash payments made or received regarding a lease obligation are
reported as a financing activity for the lessee.
• Complex financial instruments
Upon issuance of a hybrid instrument such as a convertible bond, only one cash
inflow is recorded in the SCF for both the debt and the equity portion of the instrument. For more details regarding hybrid instruments, refer to the earlier complex
financial instruments chapter.
• Stock splits and dividends
As these are non-cash transactions, they are excluded from the SCF, although
supplementary disclosures are required.
• Estimate for uncollectible accounts

20.9. IFRS/ASPE Key Differences

361

In cases where the balance sheet shows accounts receivable as a gross amount
with a separate AFDA contra account, the indirect method will net the two accounts
together and reports this net change as a change in the accounts receivable working
capital account. However, with the direct method, an analysis is done on the AFDA
to determine the current period estimate for uncollectible accounts and adjusts this
amount from sales to cash paid for goods and services. This is done because the
estimate for uncollectible accounts is debited to bad debt expense, which is usually
included as other expenses within the cash paid for goods and services category.

20.9 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
Earlier, we identified differences in the reporting items between ASPE and IFRS. For a
review, please refer to sections 20.2 and 20.5 of this chapter.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe the statement of cash flows (SCF) in accounting and
business.
The SCF reports on how a company obtains and utilizes its cash flows and how it reconciles with the opening and ending cash and cash equivalent balances of the statement
of financial position. It is separated into operating, investing, and financing activities, and
the combination of positive and negative cash flows from within each activity can provide
important information about how a company is managing its cash flows. Large differences
between reporting net income and the net cash flows from operations reduce the quality
of earnings and the reliability of the financial statements, creating the need for further
evaluation into the reasons for the differences.

LO 2: Explain the purpose of the statement of cash flows and the
two methods used.
The statement of cash flows provides the means to assess a business’s capacity to
generate cash and to determine the source of their cash flows. The statement combines
with the SFP/BS to evaluate a company’s liquidity and solvency, which represents its
financial flexibility. This information, based on past events, can be used to predict the
future financial position and cash flows of the company. It can also shed light on a

362

Statement of Cash Flows

company’s quality of earnings and whether there may be a disconnect between report
earnings and net cash flows from operating activities.
The SCF can be prepared using either the indirect or direct method. With the indirect
method, the statement is presented in three distinct sections: operating activities (net
income, current assets and liabilities), investing activities (non-current assets), and financing activities (long-term debt and equity), which follows the basic structure of the
SFP/BS classifications. The changes between the opening and closing balances of the
SFP/BS items are reported in the SCF as either cash inflows or cash outflows. The three
sections net to a single net cash inflow or outflow, when combined with the cash and cash
equivalent opening balance results in the same amount as the ending balance reported
on the SFP/BS. The only difference between the methods is the categorization of cash
flows by nature in operating activities, as occurs with the direct method. The investing
and financing sections are identical for both methods.
There are some reporting differences between IFRS and ASPE regarding interest received and paid, dividends received and paid, and income taxes paid. For simplicity’s
sake, the chapter focuses on reporting interest received and paid, dividends received in
operating activities, and dividends paid in financing activities. Income taxes paid can be
separately reported for ASPE but it is only mandatory for IFRS. Whereas, both accounting
standards require that non-cash transactions be reported in the notes to the financial
statements. Where transactions involve some cash flows, this portion of the transaction
is included in the SCF with supplementary disclosures of the transactions in the notes.
When preparing a statement of cash flows using the indirect method, the operating activities section begins with the net income/loss amount from the income statement. Entries
for non-cash items such as depreciation, depletion, amortization, and gains/losses from
sale/disposal of non-current assets are shown as adjustments to net income in order to
remove the effects of non-cash items. The remainder of the operating activities section
lists each non-cash working capital account change from opening to closing balances
and reports as either cash flow in or out (cash flow out is prefixed by a minus sign). The
investing activities are the change amounts between the opening and closing balances
for any non-current assets such as long-term investments, property, plant, equipment,
and intangible assets. Each line item from the non-current assets section of the SFP/BS
is analyzed to determine if any non-current assets were purchased or sold during the
year, and to report the cash paid or received. These amounts are reported as cash flows
in or out. The financing section uses the same method as the investing for non-current
liabilities and equities, such as any long-term debt, issuance or repurchase of shares for
cash and dividends paid. These amounts are reported as cash flows in or out. Finally, the
three sections are netted to a single amount and added to the cash and cash equivalent
opening balance. The resulting sum should match the ending cash and cash equivalent
balance reported in the SFP/BS, and the required disclosures (as described above) need
to be prepared.

Chapter Summary

363

LO 3: Describe the statement of cash flows using the direct method
and explain the difference in format from the indirect method.
With the direct method, the operating activities section is composed of major categories
of cash flows in and out (determined by nature). Categories can include cash received
from sales, cash paid for goods and services, cash paid to or on behalf of employees, as
well as separate categories for interest received and paid and dividends received.
To prepare a statement of cash flows using the direct method, the operating activities
section begins with the income statement where each line item is assigned to the most
appropriate category as either a positive cash flow in or a negative cash flow out. Noncash items are recorded as a memo item only. Next, each non-cash working capital
account change between its opening and closing balance is then assigned to the most
appropriate category as either a positive or negative cash flow. The net cash flow from
each category, and for operating activities, is calculated. The methods used to prepare
the investing and financing activities are the same as with the indirect method.

LO 4: Describe how the results from the statement of cash flows are
interpreted.
The SCF, using the indirect method, is the most commonly used format in business, and
the most important section within it is the operating activities. This is because it shows
the cash flows in or out that result from the company’s daily operations, which allows us
to determine if the company is solvent. If cash flows in this section are negative, then
management must determine if this is due to a temporary condition or if fundamental
changes are needed to better manage the collections of accounts receivables or levels
of unsold inventory. In any case, if a company is in a negative cash flow position from
operating activities, it will usually either increase its debt through borrowing, increase its
equity by issuing more shares, or sell off some of its assets. If any of these steps are
taken, they will be reported as cash inflows from either the investing or financing sections.
While none of these options are ideal, they can be used for the short-term, but they are
unsustainable in the long-run. Positive cash flows from operating activities must also be
evaluated to determine if they are sustainable and to ensure that they will be consistent
going forward.

LO 5: Describe the required disclosures for the statement of cash
flows.
The main disclosures identified in this chapter included an explanation of the changes
in the opening and closing cash balance (including cash equivalents) as well as the

364

Statement of Cash Flows

components and policy used to determine them. Cash flows in and out are classified as
operating, investing, and financing–using either the indirect or direct method. The major
classes of cash flows in and out are also to be separately reported within each of the three
sections. Cash flows from interest, dividends, and income taxes are separately disclosed
as explained above, while non-cash transactions require supplementary disclosure.

LO 6: Describe the types of analysis techniques used for the
statement of cash flows.
While the statement of cash flows may report a positive net income, this does not guarantee a positive cash flow for that period. Also, determining which activity the positive cash
flows originate from is critical analytical information for the stakeholders. At the end of
the day, operating activities must be able to sustain a positive cash flow for the company
to survive. There are ratios that assess the operating activities cash flow, but trends or
industry standards are also needed in order for the results to be informative. Two of the
common ratios used are the current cash debt coverage ratio and the cash debt coverage
ratio. Free cash flow analysis is another technique used, and it calculates the remaining
cash flow from the operating activities section after deducting cash spent on capital
expenditures, such as purchasing property, plant and equipment. Some companies also
deduct cash paid dividends. The cash flow remaining is available to the company for
strategies such as expansion, repayment of long-term debt, or down-sizing share holdings
to improve the share price, reduce the amount of dividends to pay, and to attract future
investors.

LO 7: Review and understand a comprehensive example of an
indirect and direct statement of cash flows that includes complex
transactions from intermediate accounting courses.
Examples of how to prepare a SCF using the indirect and direct method are explained
previously in the chapter. The examples include complex transactions including investments classified as available for sale, accrued pension liabilities, deferred income taxes,
bonds issued as a discount with amortization, bonds converted to shares, stock options,
and re-acquisition of shares.

LO 8: Discuss specific items that affect the statement of cash flows.
Several issues are identified, and discussed, in this section in terms of their effect on the
SCF. These include what makes up cash equivalents, restricted cash or cash equivalents,

Exercises

bank overdrafts, discontinued operations, impairments of assets, investments in associates, comprehensive income, netting of old and new liabilities, leases, complex financial
instruments, and stock splits and dividends.

LO 9: Summarize the differences between ASPE and IFRS regarding
reporting and disclosure requirements of the statement of cash
flows.
The differences are identified throughout the chapter.

negative. Assume that the company policy is for interest paid or received, and dividends
received, to be listed as operating cash flows, and for dividends paid to be listed as
financing cash flows.

Changes and Errors

Cooking the Books?
In July 2013, retail book giant Barnes & Noble created some headlines in the business
press that were less than welcome. Earlier in the month, the company’s CEO
resigned. By late July, the company released its annual report for the year ended
April 27, 2013, and reported that financial statements for the previous two fiscal years
were to be restated due to material errors resulting from inadequate controls over
the accrual reconciliation process at its distribution centres. The audit report stated
that the company had not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
When the financial statements were released, the company’s share price immediately
dropped by 5% to $17.51.
While the admission of internal control problems is certainly worrying to investors, the
restatements made in the prior years actually improved the reported results. Cost of
sales was reduced by $8.5 million in 2011 and by $6.7 million in 2012, which improved
the reported profit and earnings per share amounts. However, more interesting was
the adjustment to previously reported retained earnings. The company increased
retained earnings by almost $95 million at the start of the 2011 fiscal year and reduced
accounts payable by a similar amount. This had a significant positive effect on the
company’s net equity position. However, despite the adjustments, the company was
still experiencing current losses.
While an improvement in the balance sheet is generally viewed positively, in this
case shareholders and regulators were not impressed. On December 6, 2013, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it would be investigating
Barnes & Noble’s accounting practices, causing an immediate 11% drop in the share
price. Then, on December 19, 2013, a shareholder launched a lawsuit against the
company, claiming that the company had not properly exercised its fiduciary duties to
its shareholders. By the end of December 2013, the share price had dropped by 25%
from the price in July when the financial results were first reported.
Accounting is no different than any other activity that involves human judgment: errors
can occur. And when errors in reported financial results come to light the effects
can be profound. As seen in the example of Barnes & Noble, readers of financial
statements can react negatively to the news of errors in previously reported results.
As such, accountants need to be acutely aware of their responsibility to correct
such errors and of their requirements to fully disclose such information. Changes
in reported financial results, even if positive, can still cause a loss of confidence by
377

378

the readers, and those readers may begin to doubt the integrity of other disclosures.

Introduction
As we have discovered in our previous discussions, accounting and financial reporting
are time-sensitive activities. While the balance sheet represents the financial position
of a company at a single point in time, the income statement and cash flow statements
represent results for a defined period of time, usually one year. In attempting to present
the economic truth of a company within the limitations of time, accountants are required
to make choices, judgments, and estimations. It can be as simple as the choice of
which depreciation method to use or determining the appropriate useful life for a piece
of equipment. It is possible, however, that when accountants apply their judgment to
make choices or estimates their judgment may later prove to be incorrect. Despite the
extensive professional training that accountants receive, they can still make mistakes.
Additionally, the need to produce timely information to fulfill the requirements of financial
statement readers may sometimes result in less reliable information. In this chapter, we
will examine different types of situations that can lead to both the revision of previously
published financial information and to changes in the presentation of financial statements
in the current and future periods.

Key Differences

21.1 IAS 8
IAS 8 addresses the selection of accounting policies, changes in accounting policies,
changes in accounting estimates, and corrections of errors. The standard is designed to
ensure that the financial information is both relevant and reliable, but is also comparable
with previous periods and with other entities. The standard is, thus, consistent with the
objectives of the Conceptual Framework.
The standard indicates that the initial selection of accounting policies should follow the
principles and guidance included in the IFRS, unless there is no IFRS that relates to the
transaction in question. In such a case, management must apply judgment in selecting
accounting policies that are both relevant and reliable. It is interesting that while the
discussion of accounting policy choice in IAS 8 is generally consistent with the basic
principles of the conceptual framework, an additional descriptor “prudent” is included.
This would seem to place an additional level of responsibility on management to choose

380

Changes and Errors

accounting policies that are not misleading. The initial discussion also states that accounting policies should be applied consistently for similar transactions, events, and conditions.
IAS 8 further describes three situations where changes to accounting information may be
required:
• Changes in accounting policies
• Changes in accounting estimates
• Corrections of errors
We will examine each of these individually to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.

21.2 Changes in Accounting Policies
IAS 8 allows accounting policies to be changed in only two situations:
• The policy change is required by an IFRS.
• The new policy results in financial statements that are reliable and more relevant.
In the first case, the IFRS itself will usually provide guidance on how and when to implement the change. Sometimes these transitional procedures are quite complex, but IFRS
generally allows reasonable amounts of time for companies to adapt to the new policies.
As a general rule, the more complex the issues involved in the new policies, the longer the
transition period allowed. For example, IFRS 15, the new revenue recognition standard,
was published in May 2014, but companies are not required to implement it until January
1, 2018. Most new IFRSes allow for early adoption, that is, before the required transition
date, and many companies will be proactive and implement the change early.
The second situation is referred to as a voluntary policy change. For this type of change
the resulting information must still be considered sufficiently reliable and must also be
more relevant. This condition obviously creates a situation where management must
demonstrate logic and sound judgment. It is not generally sufficient to change accounting
policies simply to create an effect in net income without providing any further justification.
Management would need to demonstrate that the new policy better meets the needs of
the financial statement readers in terms of helping them to understand the underlying
economic reality of the company. As well, management would have to demonstrate that

21.2. Changes in Accounting Policies

381

the level of reliability inherent in the information is still sufficient to meet the general
requirement of representational faithfulness. A simple example of this type of change
would be a company’s decision to report certain property, plant, and equipment assets
under the revaluation model rather than the cost model. The company may think that
current value information is more helpful to financial statement readers than historical
cost information. While this justification is quite reasonable, the company would have to
make sure that the information on fair values had sufficient reliability to justify the change
in policy. Note that the new level of reliability does not have to equal that of the old policy,
but must simply be considered sufficient. In our example, while it is unlikely that fair value
information would be as reliable as historical cost information, the new information could
still be considered sufficiently reliable under the requirements of the fair value hierarchy.
Of course, it is not always easy to prove that one type of information is more relevant than
another. Relevance is very subjective, and readers of financial statements will have different ideas of what information they require. As well, the question of relevance is unique
to each business, and different companies may come to different conclusions about the
accounting policy choices that they need to implement. In each case, management and
the accountants advising them will need to use sound judgment and good sense in order
to choose the best accounting policies suited to the circumstances facing the company.

21.2.1 Applying Voluntary Accounting Policy Changes
IAS 8 requires voluntary accounting policy changes to be treated retrospectively, meaning that after the new policy has been applied, the financial statements should appear
as if the policy has always been in effect. The purpose of this approach is to maintain
the comparability of current financial results with previous periods. Readers of financial
statements need to make decisions regarding current results, and one of the criteria they
may use is the change in performance from previous periods. Obviously, if an accounting
policy was changed, and the prior periods were not restated, it would be impossible to
make any meaningful comparisons.
Several steps are involved in retrospective application of policy changes:

1. The cumulative effect of the policy change on previous periods must be determined.
2. A journal entry is made to record the effect of this change. This adjustment will affect
the appropriate category of equity and any other balance sheet amounts at the start
of the current period.
3. Any financial statements that are presented for comparative purposes will also be
restated to reflect the policy change. The opening balance of the relevant equity
account on the earliest financial statement presented will need to be adjusted for

382

Changes and Errors

the cumulative effect at that time. As well, any earnings per share disclosures will
need to be adjusted.
4. Disclosures are made to provide details of the reasons and effects of the policy
change.

These steps can be demonstrated with the following example. Dameron Inc. purchased a
piece of vacant land on January 1, 2015. The company intended to develop the property
into a commercial shopping mall. The original purchase price was $2,000,000 and the
company chose to apply the cost method to the property. However, in 2017, the company
decided to then apply the fair value method as allowed under IAS 40, as management
believed that this method would provide more relevant information to financial statement
readers. No development work had yet been performed on the property, but the company
was able to obtain independent, reliable appraisals of the fair value of the property as
follows:
Appraisal Date
31 December 2015
31 December 2016
31 December 2017

Appraised Value
$1,850,000
$2,100,000
$2,275,000

On the 2015 and 2016 financial statements, the property was originally reported at its
historical cost, which means there was no effect on the reported income in those periods.
The company pays corporate income tax at the rate of 20%. The following information
summarizes the effects of the change (take the income before tax figures as given):

Recall that the effect of applying IAS 40 is that every year, any changes in the fair value
of the investment property will be reported as a gain or loss directly on the income
statement. For example, in 2015 the property’s fair value drops by $150,000 ($2,000,000−
$1,850,000) during the year, so net income is reduced accordingly from $680,000 to
$530,000. In 2016, the fair value increases by $250,000 ($2,100,000 − $1,850,000) so
the income in that year is increased. Note as well that there is an income tax effect to
the change each year. Although changes in fair value of an investment property are not
usually directly taxable, there would still be an effect on the deferred taxes reported by the
company.
In 2017, the company needs to record the effect of the change on opening balances. The
books for 2015 and 2016 are already closed, but the books for 2017 are open. Thus, the
cumulative effect up to the end of 2016 must be adjusted through retained earnings, net of
the relevant tax effect. The fair value of the property on December 31, 2016 is $2,100,000
while the original cost is $2,000,000. A gain of $100,000 must be reflected in the carrying
amount of the investment. The effect on the prior year’s net income would be $80,000
($100,000 gain less the tax effect) and the remaining $20,000 is reported as a deferred
tax liability. The following journal entry will record this effect:

This journal entry corrects the land and deferred tax liability balances to the values that
would have existed had the policy been implemented when the land was first purchased.
As adjustments under IAS 40 flow to the income statement, the correct equity account to
capture the net effect of the adjustment is retained earnings. In 2017, now that the policy
has been implemented, the company will simply report the adjustment to fair value in the
normal fashion as required by IAS 40.
If 2015 and 2016 are both being presented as comparative information in the 2017 finan-

384

Changes and Errors

cial statements, then the revised statements above would be presented with the heading
“restated,” along with note disclosures describing the change (this will be discussed later
in the chapter). However, many companies only present one year as comparative information on current financial statements. If Dameron Inc. uses the former approach, then
the retained earnings portion of the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity would
look like this:
2017
Opening balance, as previously stated
Effect of accounting policy change, net of taxes of $30,000
Opening balance, restated
Net income for the year
Closing balance

$2,125,000

(Restated)
$1,469,000
(120,000)
1,349,000
776,000
$2,125,000

By identifying the effect of the change on opening retained earnings, the financial statements allow readers to compare the results to previously published financial statements.
As well, IFRS requires the presentation of an opening restated balance sheet for the
earliest comparative period. This presentation, along with the explanatory notes, should
help maintain the consistency needed to satisfy the decision needs of those financial
statement readers.

21.2.2 Impracticability
IAS 8 contemplates the possibility that it may be impracticable to apply an accounting
change retrospectively. This may occur when, despite the accountant’s best efforts, the
information needed to determine the effect on prior periods is not available. Additionally,
it is possible that in order to determine the effect assumptions need to be made about
management’s intentions in a prior period. Another possibility is that assumptions about
conditions existing at the previous financial statement date need to be made in order to
determine the effect. However, it is impossible for the accountant to determine if that
information would have been available. When any of these circumstances occur, it is
impossible for the accountant to reliably determine the effect of the policy change on
prior period financial statements. It is important that the accountant not apply hindsight
when determining the practicability of applying an accounting change. Information may
have become available after a previous reporting period, but the accountant shouldn’t use
this information to make estimates for that period or to determine management intent if it
wasn’t available at the time.
Obviously, the accountant will need to apply reasoned judgment to determine if retrospective application is warranted or not. If, after careful consideration of all the facts, the
accountant decides that retrospective application is impracticable, then the accountant

21.3. Changes in Accounting Estimates

385

can only apply the change to the earliest possible period where it is practicable. This
means that the accountant may be able to partially apply the retrospective technique, that
is to some previous years, but not to all. If there is no way to determine the effect of the
change on prior periods, then the change will be applied prospectively, that is in the
current year and in future years only. Additionally, full disclosure must be made for the
reasons for not applying the change retrospectively.

21.3 Changes in Accounting Estimates
As we have seen in previous chapters, many accounting assertions require the use of
estimates. Some more common estimates include the useful life of a piece of equipment,
the percentage of accounts receivable that are expected to be uncollectible, and the
net realizable value of obsolete inventory. The use of estimates is considered to be a
normal part of the accounting process, and it is presumed that the accountant, when
making an estimate, will take into account all the relevant information that is available at
that time. However, new information can become available in later accounting periods
that will cause accountants to reconsider their original estimates. If this information was
not available at the time of the original estimate, it would be inappropriate to go back
and restate prior period financial results. As such, changes in accounting estimates are
treated prospectively, meaning financial results are adjusted to reflect the new information
in the current year and in future periods. No attempt is made to determine the effect on
prior years, and no adjustment to opening balances is necessary.
Consider the following example. Umbach Inc. purchased a machine to be used in its
manufacturing facility on January 1, 2015. The machine cost $120,000 and was expected
to be used for eight years, with no residual value. On January 1, 2017, an engineering
review of the machine’s performance indicated that its useful life is now six years instead
of eight.
The machine would have been originally depreciated at $15,000 ($120,000 ÷ 8 years) per
year. Thus, on January 1, 2017, the carrying amount of the machine would have been
$90,000 ($120,000 − ($15,000 × 2 years)). On January 1, 2017, the remaining useful
life is now four years (6 − 2). The new depreciation amount will therefore be $22,500
($90,000 ÷ 4 years) per year. On December 31, 2017, the following journal entry will be
made:

Credit

Note that we are simply recording the new depreciation amount in the normal fashion

386

Changes and Errors

without making any attempt to restate prior depreciation amounts. This is the essence of
prospective application: simply recalculating the amount based on the new information,
and using this amount for current and future years only.
In some cases, however, it may not be clear if a change is a change in estimate or
a change in policy. For example, changing from straight-line depreciation to declining
balance depreciation may appear to be a change in policy. However, this change might,
in fact, reflect a revision of management’s view of how the pattern of benefits is being
derived from the asset’s use. In this case, the change would be treated as a change in
estimate. If it is not clear whether a change is change in policy or a change in estimate,
IAS 8 suggests that the change should be treated as a change in estimate.

21.4 Correction of Errors
Given the complex nature of some accounting transactions, it is inevitable that errors
in reported amounts will sometimes occur. IAS 8 defines errors as both omissions and
misstatements, and suggests that errors result from the failure to use or misuse of reliable
information that was available and could have reasonably been expected to be obtained
when the financial statements were issued. Thus, management cannot claim that a
misstatement is simply a change in estimate if they did not take reasonable steps to verify
the original amount recorded. IAS 8 also suggests that errors can include mathematical
mistakes, mistakes in application of accounting policies, oversights, misinterpretations of
facts, and fraud. We can see that there is quite a range of potential causes of financial
misstatements. However, regardless of the cause, errors need to be corrected once they
are discovered.
If the error is discovered before the financial statements are issued, then the solution
is simple: correct the error. This is a normal part of the accounting and audit cycle
of a business, and the procedure of correcting errors with year-end adjusting journal
entries is quite common. However, if the error is not discovered until after the financial
statements have been published, then the company faces a much larger problem. If the
error is discovered soon after the financial statements are published, it may be possible
to recall the documents and republish a corrected version. However, it is more likely
that the error will not be discovered until financial statements are being prepared for
a subsequent year. In this case, the error will appear in the amounts presented as
comparative figures, and will likely also have an effect on the current year. In this case,
the error should be corrected through a process of retrospective restatement, similar
to the procedures used for accounting policy changes. Note that a subtle difference in
terminology is used: accounting policy changes are retrospectively applied, while error
corrections result in retrospective restatements. Despite the difference in terms, the basic
principle is the same: a retrospective restatement results in financial statements that
present the comparative and current amounts as if the error had never occurred.

21.4. Correction of Errors

387

Consider the following example. In preparing its 2017 financial statements, management
of Manaugh Ltd. discovered that a delivery truck purchased early in 2015 had been
incorrectly reported as a repair and maintenance expense in that year rather than being
capitalized. The vehicle’s cost was $50,000 and was expected to have a useful life of five
years with no residual value. Assume that depreciation for tax purposes is calculated in
the same way as for accounting purposes, and that the company’s tax rate is 20%. Also
assume that prior year tax returns will be refilled to reflect the correction of the error.
Prior to the discovery of the error, the company reported the following results on its 2017
draft financial statements:

Revenue
Expenses
Income before tax
Income tax
Net income
Opening retained earnings
Closing retained earnings

2017

225,000

In order to correct the error, we need to understand the balances of the relevant accounts
prior to the error correction, and what they should be after the error is corrected. This
analysis will need to be applied to all years affected by the error. Although there is no
prescribed format for evaluating the effects of errors, a tabular analysis, as shown below,
is often useful:

Note that the adjustment corrects the balance sheet accounts, including retained earnings, to the amounts that would have been reported at December 31, 2017, had the error
never occurred. The adjustment to retained earnings represents the net effect on income
of the correction in 2015 and 2016, that is, $32,000 − $8,000. As well, because the books
for 2017 have not yet been closed, we are able to adjust the two expense accounts,
depreciation and income taxes, directly to the income statement. If, however, the books
had already been closed for 2017, then these expense amounts would simply be added
to the retained earnings adjustment.
After correcting the error, the financial statements will be presented as follows:
2017
Revenue
Expenses
Income before tax
Income tax
Net income

$900,000
700,000
200,000
40,000

2016
(Restated)
$ 850,000
635,000
215,000
43,000
$ 172,000

The retained earnings portion of the statement of shareholders’ equity will include the
following information:
2017
Opening balance, as previously stated
Effect of error correction, net of taxes of $8,000
Opening balance, restated
Net income for the year
Closing balance

$1,254,000
160,000
$1,414,000

2016
(Restated)
$1,050,000
32,000
1,082,000
172,000
$1,254,000

The difference between the corrected closing retained earnings balance and the uncorrected balance ($1,414,000 − $1,398,000 = $16,000) can be derived directly from the
journal entry by adding the prior period retained earnings adjustment to the current year
expense adjustments ($24,000 + $2,000 − $10,000 = $16,000). Also note that the balance sheet will present the corrected amounts for the vehicle, accumulated depreciation,

income taxes payable, and retained earnings with the 2016 comparative column labelled
as “restated.”
Analyzing and correcting errors is one of the most important skills an accountant can
possess. This skill requires not only judgment, but also a very solid understanding of
the operation of the accounting cycle, as the sources and effects of the errors may not
always be obvious. Additionally, the accountant needs to be aware of the causes of the
errors, as some parties may prefer that the accountant not detect or correct the error. In
such cases of fraud or inappropriate earnings management, managers may deliberately
try to hide the error or prevent correction of it. In other cases, management may try
to offer explanations that suggest the error is just a change in estimate, not requiring
retrospective restatement. Sometimes these justifications may be motivated by factors
that don’t reflect sound accounting principles. As such, the accountant must be prudent
and exhibit good judgment when examining the causes of errors to ensure the final
disclosures fairly present the economic reality of the situation.

21.5 Presentation and Disclosure
Because changes in accounting policies and errors may fall outside of the normal expectations of financial statement readers, it is not surprising that additional disclosures are
required. When an accounting policy is changed, the following disclosures are required:

• If the change results from the initial application of an IFRS then disclosure must
be made of the title of the new IFRS being applied, the nature of the change, a
description of any transitional provisions, and the potential effect of those transitional
provisions on future periods.
• If the change is a voluntary policy change then disclosure must be made of the
nature of the change and the reasons why the change results in reliable and more
relevant information.
• For both types of change, disclosure must be made of the effects on each financial
statement line item and earnings per share in the current and prior periods, and the
amount of adjustment that relates to periods prior to the earliest period presented.
• If it was impracticable to apply the change retrospectively to all previous periods, an
explanation of the reasons why should be provided along with a description of how
the change was applied.
• If the entity has not yet applied a new IFRS (that is, issued but not yet effective), the
entity should disclose, where possible, an estimate of the future effects of the new
IFRS on financial statements.

390

Changes and Errors

When a change in an accounting estimate is applied, the following disclosures are required:

• The nature and the amount of the change, including the effect on the current period
and the expected effects on future periods, should be disclosed.
• If the effect on future periods cannot be determined, this fact should be disclosed.

It should be noted that, as with all accounting applications, the principle of materiality
applies. As a practical matter, companies may not disclose all changes in estimates if the
effects are not deemed to be material. However, companies are sometimes criticized for
using immaterial estimate changes as a way to engage in creative earnings management.
Obviously, careful consideration needs to be given to the required level of disclosures in
cases like these.
For corrections of accounting errors, the following disclosures are required:

• The nature of the prior period error should be disclosed.
• Disclosure must be made of the effects on each financial statement line item and
earnings per share in the current and prior periods, and the amount of adjustment
that relates to periods prior to the earliest period presented.
• If it was impracticable to retrospectively restate all previous periods, an explanation
of the reasons why should be provided along with a description of how the correction
was applied.

21.6 Examples
Review the December 31, 2013 financial statements of Nestlé Group (taken from the
company’s annual report).
These financial statements provide a number of examples of how accounting changes
are handled. First, in Note 1 on page 80, there is a general discussion of the use
of estimates. The discussion identifies several areas where estimates are required—
provisions, goodwill impairment, employee benefits, allowance for doubtful receivables,
and taxes. The note also states that estimate changes are accounted for in the current
and future periods to which the change affects, which is consistent with the prospective
approach discussed previously in Section 21.3.

21.7. IFRS/ASPE Key Differences

391

On page 117, Note 13.1 on provisions describes the revision of previous estimates by
using the phrase “unused amounts reversed.”
In addition to the estimate changes, the prior year comparatives were both “restated”
and “adjusted.” The restatement related to the application of two new IFRSes: IAS
19 and IFRS 11. The application of these new standards resulted in changes to both
the income statement and the balance sheet of the previous year. A restated balance
sheet on January 1, 2012 was also provided. As well, asset and liability accounts on
the restated balance sheet were further adjusted due to a change in the provisional
amounts of net assets obtained on the acquisition of a subsidiary company, as complete
information was not available at the time of acquisition. This change is treated similarly to
an error correction, and the comparative figures have been retrospectively restated. The
disclosure of these restatements and adjustments can be found in Note 22 on pages 140
through 146 of the financial statements. As well, Note 2.2 on page 92 provides further
details about the adjustments resulting from the acquisition of the subsidiary company.
These examples provide a good illustration of the detail required in the disclosure of
accounting changes. This detail can help the readers make better comparisons with
previous years’ results as well as with other entities, both of which could have an impact
on readers’ decision-making processes.

21.7 IFRS/ASPE Key Differences
IFRS
A voluntary accounting policy change can
only be made if the new policy results in
reliable and more relevant information.

ASPE
A voluntary accounting policy change can
be made if either:
1. The new policy results in reliable
and more relevant information, or
2. It is a change between alternative
methods specifically allowed in
certain GAAP standards
(investments in subsidiaries, jointly
controlled enterprises and
associates, intangible assets,
defined benefit plans, income taxes,
and financial instruments).

Errors should be corrected
retrospectively, unless it is impracticable
to do so.

Errors should always be corrected
retrospectively. There is no recognition of
the concept of impracticability for error
corrections.

392

Changes and Errors

When applying a change retrospectively,
a restated balance sheet at the beginning
of the earliest comparative period must
be presented.
Disclosure of the potential future effects
of accounting standards issued, but not
yet effective, needs to be made.

When applying a change retrospectively,
the effect on the opening balances of the
earliest comparative period should be
identified, but a restated opening balance
sheet is not required.
No disclosures for standards not yet
implemented are required.

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Describe the different types of accounting changes.
There are three types of accounting changes: a change in accounting policy, which
can be either voluntary if the change results in information that is reliable and more
relevant, or required by the application of an IFRS; a change in accounting estimate,
which presumes that the estimate was made with all the relevant information available
at the time; and the correction of an accounting error, which means both omissions and
misstatements and can include mathematical errors, mistakes in application of accounting
policies, oversights, misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.

LO 2: Apply the appropriate method of accounting for an accounting
policy change.
When applying an accounting policy change required by an IFRS, the IFRS will usually
provide detailed transition provisions that outline the procedures. Voluntary accounting
policy changes should be applied retrospectively, where all current and comparative information are restated as if the policy were always in effect. This means that opening
balances will need to be restated, including the relevant equity accounts.

LO 3: Apply the appropriate method of accounting for an accounting
estimate change.
Accounting estimate changes should be treated prospectively. This means that the new
information is applied to the current year and any future years, if applicable. No attempt
is made to restate prior periods, as it is assumed that the previous estimates were made
with sound judgment based on all the information available at the time.

Chapter Summary

393

LO 4: Apply the appropriate method of accounting for an error
correction.
When errors in prior period financial statements are discovered, the errors should be
corrected retrospectively. This means that prior balances should be restated as if the error
had never occurred. This will also require restatement of the relevant equity accounts.

LO 5: Identify the disclosure requirements for different types of
accounting changes.
With retrospective restatement due to policy changes or error corrections, the reasons
for the change must be identified and any transitional provisions disclosed. As well, the
effects on each financial statement line item and earnings per share for current and prior
periods should be identified. Comparative financial statements should be restated, and
an opening balance sheet for the earliest comparative period should be presented. If
retrospective application is impracticable, an explanation is required. The potential future
effects of any IFRSes that are issued but not yet effective must also be disclosed. For
estimate changes, the nature of the change and the effects on current and future periods
should be disclosed. If the effects on future periods cannot be determined, this fact should
be disclosed.

LO 6: Describe the key differences between IFRS and ASPE with
respect to the treatment of accounting changes and error
corrections.
IFRS only allows accounting policy changes if the new policy results in more relevant and
reliable information. ASPE allows policy changes in the same circumstances, and also
allows changes between acceptable alternatives identified for certain GAAP standards.
ASPE requires errors to be corrected retrospectively, while IFRS requires retrospective
restatement unless it is impracticable to do so. For a retrospective change, IFRS requires
a restated balance sheet for the earliest comparative period, while ASPE only requires
identification of the changes in the affected items. IFRS requires disclosure of the potential effects of accounting standards issued, but not yet effective, while ASPE does not
require this disclosure.

EXERCISE 21–2
The financial controller of McEwan Limited, a publishing company, noted the following two
items in a report to the finance director on the preliminary accounts for the year ended
December 31, 2016:
• A copyright for a novel originally purchased for $100,000 in 2013 was being amortized over ten years with an expected residual value of $10,000. However, due to
poor sales and a scandal earlier this year involving the author, it is now expected
that the book will only be commercially viable for another year and the copyright will
have no residual value.
• An insurance premium of $1,500 was paid on November 1, 2015, for a one-year
policy. The payment was recorded as a debit to insurance expense in 2015.
Required:
a. Discuss the appropriate accounting treatment for two changes above.
b. Assuming the books are closed for 2015 and open for 2016, provide the journal
entries required to address the two changes. Ignore income tax effects.

EXERCISE 21–3
The accountant of Swift Inc. was preparing for the audit of its financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2017, and discovered that an automobile was being incorrectly
depreciated. The automobile was purchased on January 1, 2016, for $50,000 and the
estimated residual value after five years was expected to be $5,000. The company uses
the straight-line basis for depreciating vehicles, but the residual value was not considered when determining the depreciation amount. The financial controller informed the
accountant that the company was switching to the double-declining balance method of
depreciation for the current and future years, as it was believed this method would more
accurately portray the consumption of benefits received from the asset’s use.
Required: Prepare the journal entries required on December 31, 2017. Ignore income
tax effects.

EXERCISE 21–4
Aldiss Ltd. currently uses the cost model for reporting its property, plant, and equipment
assets. Management has decided to begin applying the revaluation model in the 2017

fiscal year to the company’s office building, as it is believed that this will provide more
relevant information to the shareholders. Although the company has been using the cost
model, the following reliable valuations of the building were obtained:
31 December 2013
31 December 2015
31 December 2017

$800,000
$825,000
$740,000

The building was purchased on January 1, 2013, for $750,000. Straight-line depreciation
is used and the estimated useful life is 30 years with no residual value.
Required: Prepare the journal entries required on December 31, 2017, to reflect the
accounting policy change. Ignore income tax effects.

EXERCISE 21–5
Simic Distributors has been using the weighted average (WA) costing method to report
its inventory and cost of sales amounts for several years. Early in 2016, management decided that the FIFO costing method would provide more relevant information to the financial statement readers. The following information regarding year-end inventory amounts
has been determined:
Date
31 December 2013
31 December 2014
31 December 2015

Inventory – WA
$500,000
$590,000
$660,000

Inventory – FIFO
$530,000
$650,000
$730,000

Information for inventory amounts prior to the 2013 fiscal year cannot be obtained. The
company’s retained earnings balances prior to the change were $1,100,000 on December
31, 2014, and $1,375,000 on December 31, 2015. The company’s tax rate is 30%.
Required:
a. Prepare the journal entry required in 2016 to reflect the accounting policy change.
Assume the books have been closed for 2015 and for all previous years.
b. Prepare the comparative column of the retained earnings portion of the statement
of shareholders’ equity that will be presented in the 2016 financial statements. The
net income previously reported in 2015 was $275,000.

EXERCISE 21–6
The auditors of Boyle Inc. have just completed the fieldwork of the company’s first audit for
the year ended December 31, 2016. The following potential errors have been identified:
• The balance of the salaries payable account, $52,000 has remained unchanged
from the previous year. The controller indicated that the balance should be $45,000.
• On December 28, 2015, a fire destroyed one of the company’s delivery vehicles. Insurance proceeds of $8,000 were received on January 16, 2016, and were credited
to miscellaneous revenue. The delivery vehicle’s original cost was $40,000, and at
the time of the fire the accumulated depreciation was $26,000. Further depreciation
of $5,000 was recorded in 2016, as the vehicle had not been removed from the
equipment subledger.
• Based on deteriorating economic circumstances, the company decided that the
allowance for doubtful accounts for 2016 should be 2% of the accounts receivable
balance instead of the 1% that had been used in the previous year. The accounts
receivable balances were $1,500,000 in 2016 and $1,750,000 in 2015. No entry has
yet been made for the 2016 bad debts, and the balance in the allowance for doubtful
accounts has remained unchanged from December 31, 2015.
• Due to a number of cut-off errors, the ending inventory balance on December 31,
2015, was overstated by $8,000 and was understated by $12,000 on December 31,
2016.
Required: Prepare the journal entries required to correct the above errors. The books for
2016 are still open, but the books for 2015 have been closed. Ignore income tax effects.

EXERCISE 21–7
Spark Ltd. has just completed preparing its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The assistant controller has brought the following items to the attention
of the controller:
• In 2016, $9,000 of repairs expense was mistakenly charged to the equipment account. Depreciation has already been recorded in 2016 and 2017. The company
uses straight-line depreciation and records half of the normal depreciation charge
in the year of acquisition. The equipment’s estimated useful life is six years with no
residual value.
• No adjustment has yet been made for accrued interest on a loan receivable. Regular
interest payments are made on February 28, May 31, August 31, and November 30,

398

with interest revenue being recorded at the time of the payment. The balance of the
loan receivable is $150,000 and the annual interest rate is 8%. The balance of the
interest receivable account is $1,000, which is unchanged from the previous year.
• On July 1, 2015 a factory building was purchased for $1,000,000. The full amount of
the purchase price was recorded in the building account, but 25% of the cost should
have been allocated to land. The building is being depreciated on a straight-line
basis with an estimated useful life of 50 years and a residual value of $50,000.
• On September 30, 2017, a fully depreciated factory machine was sold to a scrap
metal dealer for $1,500. The original cost of the machine was $52,000. When the
machine was sold, the proceeds were credited to the factory machine account.
Required: Prepare the journal entries required in 2017 to correct the above items. The
books for 2017 are open, but the books for previous years are closed. Ignore income tax
effects.

EXERCISE 21–8
You are the senior in charge of the audit of Rankin Ltd. for the year ended December 31,
2016. In the process of reviewing the audit working papers, you discovered the following:
• In 2015, an automobile purchase was incorrectly charged to the repair expense
account. The cost of the automobile was $35,000, and its expected useful life
was six years with a residual value of $5,000. The company uses double-declining
balance depreciation with a full year of depreciation being charged in the year of
acquisition.
• In 2014, a lawsuit was launched against the company for a product liability issue.
The company’s lawyers initially indicated that the company was likely to lose, and a
provision of $750,000 was established. Late in 2016, the case was approaching a
verdict, and the company’s lawyers now indicated that the company would not lose
the case and would, therefore, not be required to pay a settlement.
• Goods that were sold on credit for $18,000 on December 28, 2016, FOB destination
were recorded as a sale on that date. The customer received the goods on January
4, 2017. The cost of the goods was $11,500.

net incomes were $1,200,000 in 2016 and $1,050,000 in 2015. You have also received
the following information:
• A surplus building was rented to a tenant, starting on July 1, 2015. The lease term
was 24 months and the annual rent was $60,000. The tenant paid the full amount
required under the lease (i.e., $120,000) on July 1, 2015, and this amount was
recorded as rental income.
• The company has never reported unused office supplies as an asset on its balance
sheet. Office supplies have always been immediately expensed when purchased.

$18,000
$13,500
$19,200

• The company started offering a three-year warranty on its products in 2015. The
warranty expense recorded was based only on actual expenditures made in each
year. It was estimated, however, that warranty claims should eventually total 1% of
revenue in each year. Sales and expenditures were as follows:

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis
Overview

Trading Has Been Suspended for SEHK: 0940
On December 4, 2015, a Hong Kong-listed animal drug company, China Animal
Healthcare Ltd. (SEHK: 0940), announced a delay in the release of its financial
statements. The firm alleged that a thief had stolen the truck in which the past
five years of the company’s financial records were being transported. The theft was
alleged to have occurred during middle of a forensic audit, when the truck’s driver,
who was transporting the original financial documents from Qingyuan area to Hebel
province, stopped and left the truck for a lunch break.
The company continues to be embroiled in the forensic accounting investigation,
stalled as a result of the missing financials statements now labelled the “Lost
Documents.” As of March 2016, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange suspended the
company’s shares trading when the firm missed its deadline for filing the 2014 financial
results. The suspension is expected to continue until further notice, while the company
continues its search for the stolen documents.
This situation has created more than a little angst for 20% shareholder Eli Lilly’s
Elanco company, which invested $100 million in the troubled China Animal Healthcare
Ltd. in 2013. These recent events threaten to suspend Elanco’s efforts to expand its
presence in China, giving its competition a potential advantage.
If the issue is not resolved soon, Elanco may be on the hunt for another China-based
partner to give it a stake in one of China’s fastest growing markets for animal health.

Introduction
The previous chapters of this text and the previous course text were focused on the
individual aspects of financial reporting. For example, the previous intermediate financial
accounting text covered how to prepare the basic core financial statements as well as
the more complex aspects of current and long-term assets. In contrast, this text has
discussed the complex issues regarding current and long-term liabilities and equity such
as complex financial instruments, income taxes, pensions, leases, earnings per share,
as well as an in-depth look at accounting changes, error analysis, and the direct method
for preparing the statement of cash flows. This last chapter will focus on pulling together
these individual topics into a cohesive overview of financial statement disclosures and
analyses.

22.1 Disclosures and Analysis: Overview
The underlying purpose of the financial statements is to tell a story about the operations
of a business from its inception to its dissolution. What stories could China Animal
Healthcare’s financials tell had they not been stolen, and how might this event affect
investor and creditor decisions? Given the complexities in today’s marketplace, decisionmaking for creditors and investors can be quite challenging. Financial statements only
have meaning, and therefore appropriate influence, if they are complete and if users
know how to interpret them. Appropriate disclosures and financial statement analysis
are an important part of this evaluative process.
To aid users in understanding financial statements, most medium to large businesses
prepare extensive disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. In addition, monthly
or quarterly interim financial statements are often prepared that provide an early warning
system for management and other select users, such as creditors, who monitor debt and

404

compliance with restrictive covenants. Additionally, if business activities are diversified,
segmented reporting is another financial report that separates business operations into
segments such as geographical operations or various business lines. This allows stakeholders to determine which segments contribute the most to the overall business.
To assist with the task of a thorough financial statement assessment, there are several
analytical techniques available to stakeholders. These include ratio, common size, and
vertical and trend analysis. Actual results reported in the financial statements can be
compared to the business’s own strategic forecast and to industry competitors to see if it
is keeping pace, growing, or shrinking.
Understanding a business, however, is more than just analyzing the core financial statements. Business stakeholders need to consider the quality of management, the overall
industry climate, as well as projected economic developments. This information comes
from many different sources such as the notes to the financial statements and the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) report, which presents information about the
operations, company liquidity, capital resources, economic outlook, and any risks and
uncertainties. Independently prepared reports such as auditor’s reports, analysts’ reports,
economic reports, and news articles are also an important source of information.
The purpose of this chapter is to focus on the bigger picture of a business’s overall current
financial performance through the accurate interpretation of the financial statements and
their disclosures.

22.2 Disclosure Issues
Recall from our previous discussions that the purpose of financial reporting is to provide
financial information that is useful to investors, lenders, and other creditors in making
decisions about providing resources to the company. In this text, we have focused on the
preparation of financial reports to meet the usefulness criteria identified above. However,
it is important to keep in mind a fundamental deficiency of financial reporting: it is backward looking. That is, financial statements report on events that have already occurred.
For investors and creditors, the more relevant consideration is the financial performance
in the future, as this is where profits and returns will be made. While the accounting
profession has always assumed that historical financial statements are useful in making
predictions about the future, users understand that the financial statements are only one
of many sources of information required to make well-informed decisions. In this section,
we will examine some of the other types of information used by investors, as well as some
of the specific disclosures that enhance the financial statements themselves.

22.2. Disclosure Issues

22.2.1 Full Disclosure
The concept of full disclosure is a well-established principle that has been broadly recognized as an essential component of financial reporting models. The principle is derived
directly from the economic concept of the efficient securities market. A semi-strong
efficient securities market is a market in which securities trade at a price that reflects
all the information that is publicly available at the time. Although there have been many
studies over the years that question the true level of efficiency in securities markets, strong
evidence suggests that share prices do respond quickly to new information. Thus, from
the perspective of a financial statement preparer, full and complete information should be
disclosed in order to meet the needs of the readers. This will help engender a sense of
confidence not only in the individual company, but also in the market as a whole, and will
help alleviate the problem of information asymmetry.
One way that accountants contribute to the process of full disclosure is through the
presentation of financial statement notes. The notes include additional explanations and
details that provide further information about the numbers that appear in the financial
statements. This additional information can help readers understand the results more
fully, which can lead to better decisions. The notes also contain a description of significant
accounting policies. These disclosures are very important to help readers understand
how accounting numbers are derived. In making investment decisions, readers may
wish to compare one company’s performance to another’s. Because accounting standards sometimes allow choices between alternative accounting treatments, it is important
that the readers fully understand which policies have been applied. The concept of the
semi-strong efficient market presumes that readers of financial statements can determine
the effects of different accounting policy choices, as long as the details of those policy
choices are disclosed. The principle of full disclosure also presumes that readers of
financial statements have a reasonable knowledge of business methods and accounting
conventions. Thus, the accountant is not required to explain the most basic principles of
accounting in the note disclosures. As businesses have become more complex over time,
note disclosures have become more detailed. The accounting profession is sometimes
criticized for presenting overly complicated note disclosures that even knowledgeable
readers have difficulty understanding. This criticism is a result of one of the trade-offs
that the profession often faces: the need for completeness balanced against the need for
understandability.
Most companies will disclose significant accounting policies in the first or second note
to the financial statements. A retail company, for example, may disclose an accounting
policy note for inventory as follows:
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable
value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price during

406

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

the normal course of business less estimated selling expenses. Cost is determined based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis and includes costs incurred
to bring the inventories to their present location and condition. All inventories
consist of finished goods.
Review the accounting policy notes of Canadian Tire Corporation’s 2015 annual financial
statements1 .
The significant accounting policy note begins on page 66 of the document and continues
for ten pages. Canadian Tire Corporation has fully disclosed all the significant accounting
policies to help readers understand the methods used to generate the amounts that
appear on the financial statements.
Aside from descriptions of accounting policies, the notes to the financial statements
contain further details of balance sheet and income statement amounts. For example, the
property and equipment account on Canadian Tire Corporation’s 2015 balance sheet is
disclosed as a single item. However, Note 16 (page 86 of the document) contains further
details of individual classes of assets and movements within those classes, including
opening balances for each class of property and equipment, additions and disposals
during the year, reclassification to or from the “held for sale” category, depreciation,
impairment, and other changes. This level of disclosure helps readers better understand
the asset composition and capital replacement policies of the property and equipment
account.
Aside from the financial statements themselves, companies provide further disclosures
in the annual report and in other public communications. Canadian Tire Corporation’s
2015 Report to Shareholders (Canadian Tire Corporation, 2016) is 118 pages long,
including the financial statements. Aside from the financial statements, the annual report
includes messages from the Chairman and the President/CEO, listings of the Board of
Directors and Executive Leadership Team, and a section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” (MD&A), on pages 3 to 54. The MD&A is required disclosure
under Canadian securities regulations. Similar disclosures are required or encouraged
in other jurisdictions, although they may bear different names, such as Management
Commentary or Business Review. The purpose of MD&A, and similar disclosures, is
to provide a narrative explanation from management’s perspective of the year’s results
and financial condition, risks, and future plans. The guidelines encourage companies
to provide forward-looking information to help investors understand the impact of current
results on future prospects. MD&A should help investors further understand the financial
statements, discuss information not fully disclosed in the financial statements, discuss
risks and trends that could affect future performance, analyze the variability, quality and
predictive nature of current earnings, provide information about credit ratings, discuss
short- and long-term liquidity, discuss commitments and off balance sheet arrangements,

ion_2015-Annual-Report_ENG.pdf

22.2. Disclosure Issues

407

examine trends, risks and uncertainties, review previous forward-looking information, and
discuss the risks and potential impact of financial instruments.
The objectives of MD&A are clearly aimed at helping investors link past performance
with predictions of future results. Although this type of information is consistent with
investors’ needs, there are some limitations with MD&A disclosures. First, although the
general elements are defined by securities regulations, companies have some discretion
in how they fulfill these requirements. Thus, some companies may provide standardized
disclosures that change little from year to year. Although the disclosures may meet the
minimum requirements, the usefulness of these boilerplate, or generic and non-specific
statements, may be questionable. Second, MD&A disclosures are not directly part of the
financial statements, meaning they are not audited. Auditors are required to review the
annual report for any significant inconsistencies with the published financial statements,
but the lack of any specific assurance on the MD&A may result in investors having less
confidence in the disclosures. Third, the MD&A contains more qualitative information
than the financial statements does. Although this qualitative information is useful in
analyzing past, and predicting future, financial results, it is not as easily verified as the
more quantitative disclosures.
One interesting effect of the qualitative nature of MD&A is that companies may either
deliberately or inadvertently provide signals to the readers. A number of studies have
examined the use of language and the presence of tone in the narrative discussion of the
MD&A. Although the research is not always conclusive, there is evidence to suggest that
the word choice and grammatical structures present in the reports may provide some predictive function. The language choices may reflect something about management’s more
detailed understanding of the business that is not directly disclosed in the information.
Although there are sometimes suggestions of information overload levied against the
accounting profession and securities regulators, the continually expanding volume of
financial and non-financial disclosures does suggest that there is a demand for this information and that readers are finding some value in the disclosures.

22.2.2 Related Party Transactions
One area in particular where full disclosure is important is in the case of related parties.
The accounting issue with related parties is that transactions with these parties may occur
on a non-arms-length basis. Because the transactions may occur in a manner that is
not consistent with normal market conditions, it is important that readers are alerted to
their presence. IAS 24 provides guidance to the appropriate treatment of related party
transactions and balances.
IAS 24 provides a detailed definition of related parties, as follows:

408

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

a. A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if
that person:
i. has control or joint control of the reporting entity;
ii. has significant influence over the reporting entity; or
iii. is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a
parent of the reporting entity.
b. An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies:
i. The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which
means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the
others).
ii. One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or
joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
iii. Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.
iv. One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate
of the third entity.
v. The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of
either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the
reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related
to the reporting entity.
vi. The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).
vii. A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a
member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the
entity).
viii. The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting
entity. (CPA Canada, 2016, Part I, Section IAS 24.9)
The standard further defines close family members as the children, dependents, and
spouse or domestic partner of the person in question. However, the definition leaves
some room for interpretation as it suggests that a close family member is any family
member who is expected to influence, or be influenced by, the person in question.
In cases where complex corporate structures exist, it may be helpful to draw organization
charts or other visual representations to determine who the related parties are. Correct
identification of the related parties is important, as this will determine the disclosures that
are required.
The key feature of IAS 24 is that it requires additional disclosures when related parties
exist. Specifically, all related party relationships must be disclosed, even if there are no

22.2. Disclosure Issues

409

transactions with those parties. When transactions with related parties do occur, the
amount of the transactions and outstanding balances must be disclosed, along with a
description of the terms and conditions of the transaction, any commitments, security,
or guarantees with the related party, the nature of the consideration used to settle the
transactions, and the amount of any provision or expense related to bad debts of the
related party. Additionally, the standard requires disclosure of details of compensation
paid to key management personnel. The disclosure requirements are designed to help
readers understand the potential effects of the related party transactions on the entity’s
results and financial position.
ASPE takes related party disclosures one step further by also requiring different measurement bases for the transaction, depending on the circumstances. In summary, related
party transactions are normally reported at the carrying amount of the item or services
transferred in the accounts of the transferor. This means that the transaction may need to
be remeasured at a different amount than what was agreed upon by the parties. The only
circumstances where the exchange amount (i.e., the amount agreed upon by the related
parties, is used to measure the transaction is if the transaction is:

• a monetary exchange in the normal course of operations
• a non-monetary exchange in the normal course of operations which has commercial
substance2
• an exchange not in the ordinary course of business where there is a substantive
change in ownership, the amount is supported by independent evidence, and the
transaction is monetary or has commercial substance.

These rules are intended to prevent related parties from reporting transactions at amounts
that may not be representative of fair values. By requiring most related party transactions
to be reported at the carrying amount, the standard may prevent gains or losses from
being reported that represent the result of bargaining between arm’s length parties. Only
where the transaction is monetary, has commercial substance, or is the result of a substantial change of ownership interests, can the negotiated price be used.
Other disclosure requirements under ASPE for related parties are similar to those of IFRS,
except ASPE does not specifically require the disclosure of key management compensation.

2

This rule doesn’t apply if the exchange is of assets held for sale in the normal course of operations that
will be sold in the same line of business.

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

22.2.3 Subsequent Events – After the Reporting Period
Financial statements are defined very precisely in terms of time periods. Whereas balance sheets report financial position as at a specific date, income and cash flow statements report results for a period of time ending on a specific date. It would be understandable to think that events occurring after the reporting period are not relevant, as
they do not occur within the precisely defined period covered by the financial statements.
However, remember that investors and other readers often use financial statements to
make predictions about the future. As such, if an event occurs after the reporting date,
but before the financial statements are issued, and if the event could have a material
impact on the future operations of the business, it is reasonable to expect that investors
would want to know about it. For this reason, IAS 10 takes into account the reporting
requirements where material events occur after the reporting period.
IAS 10 specifically defines the relevant reporting period as the time between the reporting
date and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue. Although the
date of authorization will depend on the legal and corporate structure relevant to the
entity, a common scenario is that the financial statements are authorized for issue when
the board of directors approves them for distribution to the shareholders. This may be
several weeks or even months after the reporting date.
The treatment of events after the reporting period will depend on whether they are adjusting or non-adjusting events. While adjusting events are those that provide further
evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date, non-adjusting events are those
that are indicative of conditions that arose after the reporting date. As suggested by the
nomenclature, when adjusting events occur, the accounts should be adjusted to reflect
the effect of those events, while non-adjusting events will not result in any adjustments to
the accounts.
The logic of this treatment is clear. If the event after the reporting date provides further
evidence of a condition that existed at the reporting date, then the amount should be
adjusted to reflect all available information. If the event only provides evidence of a new
condition that arose after the reporting date, then adjustment would not be appropriate,
as the condition didn’t exist at the reporting date.
In many cases, the appropriate treatment will be obvious. For example, if a provision for an
unsettled lawsuit were included in current liabilities on the reporting date, but the lawsuit
was later settled for a different amount before the approval of the financial statements, it
makes sense to adjust the provision to the actual settlement amount. Similarly, if an error
in the accounts is subsequently discovered before the financial statements are approved,
then the error should be corrected.
In some cases the treatment of non-adjusting events is clear. For example, if the company’s warehouse burns to the ground after the reporting period, this is clearly not in-

22.3. Auditor’s Reports

411

dicative of a condition that existed at the reporting date, and no adjustment should be
made.
In other cases, however, the treatment is less clear. For example, if a significant customer
goes bankrupt after the year-end, and no provision had been made for any bad debts,
should the accounts be adjusted? Although the customer’s bankruptcy occurred after the
reporting date, there may have been prior evidence of the customer’s financial difficulties.
One would need to look at account aging, payment patterns, and other evidence that
would have been available at the reporting date to determine if the condition existed. If
the balance of evidence suggests that the customer’s financial troubles already existed
at the reporting date, then an adjustment would be appropriate. In cases like these, the
accountant will need to apply sound judgment in evaluating all the evidence.
Even when an event is determined to be a non-adjusting event, disclosure may still
be appropriate if the event is anticipated to have a material effect on future economic
decisions. In our previous example, the destruction of a company’s warehouse may have
a serious impact on the company’s future ability to deliver products and to earn profits.
Thus, disclosure of the nature of the event, and the estimated financial effect of the event
on future results, should be made.
In rare cases, a company’s financial condition may deteriorate so quickly after the reporting period that it may be impossible for the company to continue operating. Although
events after the reporting period may not necessarily provide evidence of conditions that
existed at the reporting date, the going concern assumption will override the normal procedure. Because financial statements are presumed to be prepared on a going concern
basis, any change in this fundamental assumption would create the need for a complete
change in the basis of accounting. This would obviously have a profound effect on all
aspects of the financial statements.
The guidance in IAS 10 provides another example of how the principle of full disclosure
is employed to help financial statement readers make more informed decisions.

22.3 Auditor’s Reports
So far we have focused on the role that the accountants and management play in providing useful information to investors. Another important component of a company’s financial
statements is the audit opinion. Audit opinions are prepared by firms of independent and
professionally trained auditors whose job is to examine a company’s financial statements
and disclosures, internal control systems, and all other relevant data in order to express
an opinion on the fairness of their financial statements. Audit opinions are required for
any company that wants to trade its shares publicly; in some jurisdictions they may also
be required of private companies.

412

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

The purpose of an audit opinion is to provide assurance to the readers that a company’s
financial disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the appropriate accounting
standards and to ensure that they are not materially misstated. This assurance is important to the operation of capital markets, as investors need to have confidence in the
information that they are using to make decisions.
Although auditing standards are regulated nationally, many jurisdictions have adopted the
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), which are issued by the International Auditing
and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). With over 80 nations globally now using the
ISAs, there are still jurisdictions, such as the United States, which issue their own audit
standards. However, they have recently made attempts to harmonize these standards
with the ISAs.
The end product of the auditor’s work is an audit report that is attached to the financial
statements. This report may appear fairly simple but it is, in fact, the product of many
hours of detailed testing and procedures carried out by audit professionals. An example
of the standard form of the report used in Canada is featured below.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
[Appropriate Addressee, usually the Board of Directors]
Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Sample Company, which comprise
the statement of financial position as at December 31, 20X7, and the statement of
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the
year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.

22.3. Auditor’s Reports

413

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the
auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of
the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control.An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Sample Company as at December 31, 20X7, and its financial performance and
its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
[Auditor’s signature]
[Date of the auditor’s report]
[Auditor’s address]

Note that the final opinion states that these financial statements present fairly the financial
position and financial performance of the company in accordance with IFRS. However, in
some jurisdictions the term “present fairly” is replaced by the statement that the presentation gives a “true and fair view” of the company’s affairs. These phrasings are generally
considered to be equivalent in meaning. Also, in some jurisdictions, the audit report
may provide more details of the auditor’s procedures and further assurances regarding
regulatory or legal issues. However, the basic elements of the report will be the same.
This audit opinion is sometimes referred to as a “clean” opinion, although this term
is somewhat misleading. While the audit opinion is prepared to provide assurance to
investors, it does not guarantee that the financial statements are 100% accurate.
In some cases, auditors may find it necessary to modify their opinion. This occurs when
insufficient audit evidence is available or if material misstatements are included in the
financial statements. If these effects are not considered pervasive, the auditor can then
issue a qualified audit opinion. This type of opinion states that the financial statements
are presented fairly except for the particular accounts for which insufficient evidence or
misstatements are present. Further explanations for the reasons for the qualification will
be required in the audit report.
In cases where the effects of insufficient evidence or misstatements are considered pervasive, the auditor will have to either deny an opinion, in the case of insufficient evidence, or
issue an adverse opinion, in the case of misstatements. Effects are considered pervasive

414

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

if they are not confined to specific elements or accounts in the financial statements, if they
represent a substantial portion of the financial statements, or if they are fundamental to
the users’ understanding of the financial statements. In such cases, the auditor needs to
exercise prudent judgment, as such opinions can prove harmful to a company. As these
types of opinions essentially state that either the auditor cannot provide an opinion, or
that the financial statements are not fairly presented, they will not provide assurance to
investors. However, adverse opinions are rare, as management will try to correct any
material misstatements.
In other situations, the auditor may determine that all the appropriate disclosures have
been made, but that there is a particular disclosure that is critical to the readers’ understanding of the financial statements as a whole. In this case, the auditor may include an
emphasis of matter paragraph which highlights particular disclosures.
In summary, the audit report adds value to the package of full disclosures that companies
provide to financial statement readers to enable them to make better decisions.

22.4 Financial Statement Reporting and Analysis
Financial statement analysis is the process of reviewing and interpreting a company’s core
financial statements to make better business decisions. While it sounds simple, it isn’t.
Many tools have been developed in the financial community to assess a business’s financial performance. In simple terms, the process usually starts with a high-level liquidity,
activity, profitability, and coverage ratio analysis of the core financial statements and of the
various supplementary financial reports such as interim and segmented financial reports.
The analyses of these financial reports can also incorporate other types of ratio analysis
such as common size analysis and trend analysis. These analytical techniques have been
covered in detail in previous chapters of this text and in the previous intermediate financial
accounting text. A summary of the commonly used ratios is presented at the end of this
chapter for review purposes.

22.4.1 Interim Reporting
In basic terms, interim reports cover periods that are less than one year. As previously
stated, interim financial statements are often prepared on a monthly or quarterly basis.
They are increasingly popular as more frequent disclosures are becoming the new norm
in today’s economy. While ASPE does not provide standards regarding interim reporting,
IFRS does provide guidance that IFRS compliant companies are encouraged to follow
and to disclose.

22.4. Financial Statement Reporting and Analysis

415

In many cases, the same headings, subheadings, and subtotals would be employed for
both the interim and the annual financial statements. If segmented financial statements
are employed by a business, reportable segments would also be applied to the interim
financial statements.
IFRS supports the idea that each interim period is to be reported as separate and distinct.
Also, the same policies that are used for annual financial statements are to be used for
interim financial statements as well. This means that deferrals and accruals used in the
interim statements would follow the same principles and tests as those that are used in
the annual financial statements. Simply put, revenues would be recognized and reported
when earned (revenue recognition) and expenses incurred to earn those revenues would
be reported when goods and services were received (matching principle). Accounting
policies such as depreciation, inventory cost formulas, and required disclosures, such as
earnings per share from the annual financial statements, would also be applied equally
for interim statements. IFRS requires the same five core financial statements for interim
reporting as required for the annual reports. Interim reports can be condensed as long
as they include the same headings, subtotals, and comparative columns as in the annual
reports.
Review Suncor Energy Inc.’s 2015 Annual Report3 and financial statements. The quarterly
financial summary for each interim quarter can be found starting on page 120.
The financial data in the current Quarterly Financial Summary is comparative on a quarterly basis with the previous year, 2014, and is highly condensed. Note that the interim
report also breaks down the interim reporting periods into four product line segments,
namely oil sands, exploration and production, refining and marketing, and corporate
(Suncor Energy Inc., n.d.). Segmented reporting will be discussed in the next section.
Interim reporting has several challenges. For example, what happens when there is a
change in accounting principle? If this change were to occur in the second or third quarter,
how would this affect the first quarter interim financial statements? The consensus is
that, even if the change of a specific accounting policy, such as a depreciation method,
is prospective, the annual change should be prorated to each of the interim accounting
periods so as not to over- or understate any specific quarter. This would lessen any
tendency for management to manipulate accounting policies within a specific quarter to
influence bonuses or operational results targets. As such, even though the change in
policy is applied prospectively for the fiscal year, if interim statements are prepared, the
change in policy would be applied proportionally between each quarterly period to smooth
the results over each quarter of that fiscal year.
Further challenges to interim reporting are the cyclical and seasonal swings experienced
by businesses within a fiscal year. While revenue intake can be concentrated over a
limited number of months, expenses may continue to be incurred throughout the year.

416

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

If IFRS guidelines are followed, the principles of revenue recognition and matching will
continue to be applied within each of the interim periods and the same tests used for
annual financial statements would be applied to interim reports. With seasonal swings,
this can result in volatile earnings comparisons between quarters, which can be seen in
the wide fluctuations of Suncor Energy Inc.’s quarterly earnings per share amounts as
shown in the quarterly financial summary report referenced above.
Additionally, difficulties exist regarding certain allocations such as for income taxes and
earnings per share. Under IFRS, each interim period is to be independent of each other
and interim allocations are to be determined by applying all the same tests as those used
for the annual reports.
Note that interim financial reports are unaudited, as evidenced by the “unaudited” notation
under the title of Suncor Energy Inc.’s quarterly financial summary report. While some
stakeholders continue to push for an examination of the interim reports to provide some
assurance, auditors remain reluctant to express an opinion on interim financial statements. As a result, there will always be a trade-off between the need for assurance and
the need to produce the interim report on a timely and cost-effective basis.

22.4.2 Segmented Reporting
Structural analysis is the study of relationships between resources, people, activities,
and products. Segmented, or disaggregated, financial reporting is an example of how
structural analysis can be used for financial analysis purposes. As mentioned in the
opening comments of this chapter, more and more businesses are diversifying their business lines. This creates the need for additional reporting about those business lines—how
each contributes to the overall entity in terms of profits, growth, and risk.
Segmented reporting enhances decision making and analysis as it highlights business
components that have strong financial performances over those that are weak, or even
losing, performers. Management can subsequently make decisions about which components to keep and which components to discontinue as part of their overall business
strategy. Keep in mind, however, that not all business components that experience chronic
losses should be automatically discontinued. There can be strategic reasons for keeping
a losing component. For example, a company may retain a specific marginal, or losing
component, that produces a particular part needed for the entity’s manufacturing process. Keeping this business line guarantees a steady supply of these critical parts, thus
ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted production process with resulting sales and profits.
As different components within a company can have different gross margins, profitability,
and risk, segmented reporting can also assist in forecasting future sales, profits, and
cash flows. With segmented reporting comes a better understanding of the company’s
performance and future prospects, resulting in better decision making overall.

22.4. Financial Statement Reporting and Analysis

417

Although there are many, the two most common segmented activities are by products (or
by business lines) and by geography. Either the physical location of the company’s assets
or the location of its customers can be the geographic basis for segmentation.
For ASPE, there is currently no guidance regarding segmented reporting. As such, privately held corporations tend not to report segmented information. For IFRS companies,
however, a segment must meet several characteristics and quantitative thresholds in
order to be considered a reportable segment for the purposes of the published financial
statements.

Reportable Segments
Reportable segments possess certain characteristics, such as having separate and distinct financial information that is regularly monitored by the senior operations management. These are then tested for materiality and are identified as a reportable segment if
at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. Its reportable revenue, including inter-company sales and transfers, is 10% or greater
than the company’s combined revenue of all the segments.
2. Its reported profits or losses, in absolute amounts, are 10% or greater than the
greater of:
a. the combined reported profits
b. the combined reported losses.
3. Its assets are 10% or greater than the company’s combined assets of all the segments.
Below is some sample data from a fictitious company:

Tests:
1. Its reportable revenue is 10% or greater than company combined revenue of all segments
(10% × 4,200) = $420 threshold
2. Its reported profits/losses (in absolute amounts) are 10% or greater than the greater sum of:
a. the combined reported profits = $137
b. the combined reported losses = $11
Profits are greater, so (10% × $137) = $13.7 threshold in absolute terms (ignoring + and - math
signs)
3. Its assets are 10% or greater than the company’s combined assets of all the segments (10% ×
$895) = $89.5 threshold

Based on the three threshold tests above, Canada, the US, South America, Asia, and the
Middle East all meet at least one or more of the tests.
Once these segments are identified, IFRS recommends that reportable segments comprise 75% or more of a company’s overall combined sales to unrelated customers. They
also recommend that the number of reporting segments be limited to ten in order to
lessen the possibility of information overload. In the example above, the 75% threshold
is $3,150 ($4,200 × 75%) , and all five segments meeting at least one of the three test
criteria above total $3,500 ($500+800+600+900+700). As such, this test has been met.
It is important to note that management can override these tests and report a segment if
they consider the segmented information to be useful to the stakeholders.
There are several issues, however, with segmented reporting. For instance, accounting
processes such as allocation of common costs and elimination of inter-segment sales can
be quite challenging. For this reason, allocation of common costs is not required. As such,
thorough knowledge of the business and of the industry in which the company operates
is essential when utilizing segmented reports, otherwise investors may find segmentation
meaningless or, at worst, they may draw incorrect conclusions about the performance of
the business components. For example, a business line may repeatedly report segment
losses causing shareholders to put pressure on management prematurely to discontinue
that line even if the better long-term strategy is to keep it. Additionally, the company
may be reluctant to publish segmented information because of the risk it poses to them
by way of competitors, suppliers, government agencies, and unions potentially using this
information to their advantage and to the detriment of the company.
Review Suncor Energy Inc.’s 2015 Annual Report4 and financial statements. The information in the notes to the financial statements regarding segmented information can be
found on pages 85 to 87.

In the segmented reports, note that Suncor Energy Inc. provides general information
about each of its reportable segments and policies regarding inter-segment sales and
profit. The segmented financial report is condensed, but provided that senior management regularly reviews them, the line items identified are the minimum required disclosures according to IFRS. The segmented reports must also be reconciled to the core
financial statements for revenues and operating profits/losses. While IFRS also states
that assets and liabilities are to be reconciled, the segmented report only shows a reconciliation of non-current assets to the core statement of financial position. Other IFRS
disclosures identified for segmented reporting include revenues from external customers
as well as Canada versus foreign revenue and capital assets. While this is not an exhaustive list of all IFRS required segmented reporting disclosures, it provides a sense
that these disclosures are extensive.

22.4.3 Proforma Financial Statements
A pro forma financial statement is forward-looking, based on certain assumptions and
projections. A corporation might want to see the effects on net income resulting from
adding or dropping a reportable segment, increasing money spent on a marketing campaign, implementation of certain research or development plans, or from adoption of a
different accounting policy.
The projected financial statements are prepared on the basis of estimates with these
assumptions included, so that management can see the impact these assumptions might
have on profits or net assets. The proforma statements can include any of the core
financial statements and can be for a single year, or multiple years. In other words, it
results in a set of any financial statements that looks into the future, rather than looking at
the past as is the case with conventional financial statements.
If the projected assumptions predict a decrease in net income or net assets, the company
can respond by making operational changes much more proactively, such as increasing sales prices or decreasing expenses, before these projections become reality. The
company can incorporate certain assumptions to see their impacts, such as whether
sales or expenses are predicted to run higher in the first quarter of the year than in the
second. They can determine whether a marketing campaign need an extra boost during
a particular time of the year. In other words, they provide the company with invaluable
information to help management make the best decisions.
Once the impacts of proposed decisions are quantified, pro forma income statements
can be incorporated into the company strategic plan (another futuristic document), and
provide important benchmarks with which to measure performance going forward, or they
can be used as the basis for the work plan or budget documents for the next fiscal year.
Sounds too good to be true? Consider that the development of proforma statements is a

420

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

bit like trying to read the stock market. This is because proforma income statements that
report net income and net assets are based on estimates of unknown future events. Also,
they do not need to follow GAAP and management can manipulate the financial results to
provide a picture to investors that is rosier than reality.
Proforma statements can be a powerful predictive tool for decision-making, but they will
only be as good as the estimates and assumptions put into them, and the intentions
of management, especially if suspected of trying to deceive investors in the pro-forma
modification of GAAP net income or net assets.

22.4.4 Analysis Techniques
Many different types of ratios are used in the analysis of financial statements. For instance, ratios applied to the financial statements include liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, activity ratios, and coverage ratios. While other types of ratios exist, including
vertical/common size analysis and horizontal/trend analysis, they have been covered
in detail in previous chapters of this text and in the previous financial accounting text.
However, a summary of the commonly used ratios, and a brief overview of common size
and horizontal analysis, are presented below for review purposes:

* These two ratios can also be expressed as a single debt-to-equity ratio; Total assets ÷ Total liabilities.
A low debt-to-equity ratio indicates that creditors have less claim on the company’s assets resulting in less
financing risk.
A higher debt-to-equity ratio can mean a higher risk for financial difficulty if the debt and interest cannot be
paid when due.

Common Size Analysis
Common size, or vertical, analysis takes each line item on a financial statement and
expresses it as a percentage of a base amount. The base figure used in a balance sheet
is usually total assets, while for the income statement, it is usually net sales.
Below is an example of common size analysis of an income statement:

0.35%
29.15%

25.35%

These percentages can be compared to the previous years’ data, competitors’ financials,
or industry benchmarks. An example of a typical common size ratio that is compared
in this way is the gross margin percentage. A downside of ratio analysis, however, is
its potential to foster an environment where management chooses accounting policies,
such as inventory costing, to influence a favourable gross profit for personal reasons
such as bonuses or positive performance evaluations. In the example above, the gross
margin decreased from 42% to 40% over a two-year period. While this decline could be
a realistic reflection of operations, it could also be the result of a change in estimates or
of accounting policy to avoid income taxes. For this reason, any change in ratios should
always be investigated further.
Horizontal Analysis
Horizontal, or trend, analysis examines each line item on a financial statement in order to
see how it has changed over time. The line items that are of most interest tend to be the
changes in sales, gross profit, and net income. If the company’s operations are relatively
stable each year, this analysis can prove to be quite useful.
Below is an example of common size analysis of an income statement:

100.00% 100.00% 100.00%
102.00% 98.00% 100.00%

Note that the percentages do not add up vertically as was the case with vertical analysis.
Looking at sales, gross profit, and net income, we notice that all three have all increased,
with gross profit increasing the most. This could be due to a change in the pricing policy
as evidenced by the 5% increase in revenue over two years. However, more investigation
would be necessary to determine if the increase is due to true economic events or if it
was influenced by changes in policies made by management.
In summary, remember that when working with ratios analysis, ratios are only as good as
the data reported in the financial statements. For instance, if quality of earnings is high,
ratio analysis can be useful, otherwise it may do more harm than good. Additionally, it is
important to focus on a few key ratios for each category to avoid the risk of information
overload. Those key ratios can subsequently be investigated and tracked over time. It is
also important to understand that industry benchmarks make no assurances about how
one company compares to its competitors, as the basis for the industry ratio may differ
from the basis used for the company. While ratios provide good indicators for further
investigation, they are not the end-point if an evaluation is to be conducted properly.

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

Chapter Summary
LO 1: Discuss the rationale and methods of full disclosure in
corporate reporting.
The practice of full disclosure is motivated by the need to create information useful to
financial statement readers in helping them make decisions. Full disclosure of relevant
information can improve the efficiency of financial markets by lessening the information
asymmetry problem, thus creating more confidence for financial statement users. Financial information, however, is backward-looking in nature, so disclosures beyond the
financial statements are required. Financial statement notes provide additional details
and explanations of amounts included in the financial statements, as well as descriptions
of significant accounting policies. Complete disclosures of accounting policies are necessary in order to allow readers to make comparisons between companies. Outside the
financial statements, companies will also make other disclosures, including the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section of the annual report. This section provides
a narrative review of the year’s results from the perspective of management, as well as a
discussion of risk factors, future plans, and other qualitative information that may be useful
to readers. A well-written MD&A will help investors link past performance to predictions
of future results.

LO 2: Identify the issues and disclosure requirements for related
parties.
Related parties are either individuals or entities that are presumed to not deal with the
reporting entity at an arm’s length basis. Because related parties are assumed to have
some influence over the reporting entity, there is a possibility that transactions with these
parties may not be conducted under the same terms as with other market participants.
The existence of related parties needs to be disclosed, even if there are no transactions
with those parties during the reporting period. When transactions with related parties
do occur, the amount of the transactions and outstanding balances must be disclosed,
along with a description of the terms and conditions of the transaction, any commitments,
security, or guarantees with the related party, the nature of the consideration used to settle
the transactions, and the amount of any provision or expense related to bad debts of the
related party. Details of compensation paid to key management personnel must also be
disclosed. In certain circumstances, ASPE also requires remeasurement of related party
transactions.

Chapter Summary

427

LO 3: Describe the appropriate accounting and disclosure
requirements for events occurring after the reporting period.
Events that occur after the reporting period, but before the financial statements are authorized for issue, may require additional disclosures. If the event does not provide evidence
of a condition that existed at the reporting date, then note disclosure would generally be
the only required action. If the event does provide evidence of a condition that existed
at the reporting date, then adjustments of the reported amounts are required. However,
in some cases it may not be clear if the condition existed at the reporting date. In rare
circumstances, the subsequent event may result in a reassessment of the going concern
assumption, which would cause a complete revision of the reporting basis of the financial
statements.

LO 4: Describe the purpose of the audit opinion and the contents of
the auditor’s report.
Audit opinions are prepared by independent, professional auditors in order to provide
assurance to the readers of the financial statements that they have been prepared in
accordance with the appropriate accounting standards and that those financial statements
are not materially misstated. This assurance is intended to provide confidence to financial
market participants that the information used to make decisions is relevant and reliable. A
typical clean audit opinion would identify the auditor’s and management’s responsibilities,
the financial statements being audited, and would provide an opinion that the financial
statements are fairly presented. In cases where errors are identified, or audit evidence
is unavailable, the auditor may issue a qualified opinion if the effects are not pervasive.
Where the effects of errors or insufficient evidence are pervasive, the auditor will need to
either deny an opinion or issue an adverse opinion.

LO 5: Explain the various financial statement analysis tools and
techniques.
Techniques used to analyze financial statements include interim reporting, segmented
reporting, and various other analysis techniques. The process usually starts with a
high-level liquidity, activity, profitability, and coverage ratio analyses of the core financial
statements and of the various supplementary financial reports, such as the interim and
segmented financial reports. The analyses of these financial reports can also incorporate
other types of ratio analysis such as common size analysis and trend analysis.

428

Putting It All Together: Disclosures and Analysis Overview

LO 6: Explain the similarities and differences between ASPE and
IFRS regarding disclosures and analysis of financial statements.
Some differences exist between ASPE and IFRS regarding related parties’ disclosures
and subsequent events. However, for interim and segmented reporting, ASPE is silent.

On January 15, 2018, several pieces of plaster fell from the ceiling in the offices of Satterlee LLP, a firm of professional accountants, crushing several pairs of green eye shades.
Luckily, no accountants were injured. The management of the firm hired professional
engineers to examine the problem. The engineers determined that there were, in fact,
more serious problems in the overall structure of the building, and, in particular, the
foundation. The engineers indicated that it appeared the foundation had been sinking
for several years, although the evidence of the cracked ceiling only just appeared. The
engineers indicated that the repair work to the foundation was essential to keep the
building safe for occupation.

On November 12, 2017, the federal government filed a lawsuit against Magus Corp. The
lawsuit contends that one of Magus Corp.’s factories has been dumping unfiltered effluent
into a local river, resulting in contamination that has required the water treatment plant
downstream to commit to additional procedures to keep the water safe for community
residents. The lawsuit not only seeks compensation for the damage done, but also seeks
a remedy that would force the company to install filtration equipment at the factory to
clean the effluent before it reaches the river. The company has not accrued any provision
for this lawsuit on December 31, 2017, as the company’s legal counsel has indicated that
the outcome cannot currently be determined. Management of the company has indicated
that if they are forced to install the filtration equipment, that they will, instead, shut down
the factory as the required equipment would render the entire operation economically
infeasible. The factory in question is one of three factories that the company operates,
producing approximately 40% of the company’s output.

Government pension expense = 1,200 × 5 ÷ 10 = 600
In practice, the calculation of the government pension expense would be more
complicated than this. However, the company would likely omit this part of the
calculation, as it is not material to the accrual.

Note: This journal entry assumes that the three-year warranty period for all machines sold in 2016 has now expired. The balance of the provision must be reduced
to zero once the warranty period ends. If there were still machines with remaining
warranty rights, the balance of the provision would be carried forward to 2019 until
the warranty period expired.
b. 2016 warranty liability = 1,800,000 − 975,000 = $825,000
2017 warranty liability = 825,000 − 345,000 = $480,000
2018 warranty liability = 480,000 − 480,000 = $0
(assuming all warranty periods have expired by the end of 2018)
Note: In 2016, the liability would be separated into current and non-current portions,
based on management’s best estimate of the pattern of future warranty repairs. In
2017, the liability would be reported only as current.

b. The company’s cash decreased from the previous year, but this does not reveal
much. The ratio analysis, however, does reveal some worrying trends in liquidity.
The current ratio has been maintained at almost exactly the same level as the
previous year, but it is only slightly above 1. This may indicate that the company will
have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations when they come due. The quick
ratio further emphasizes this point. The quick ratio declined from the previous year
and is now less than 1. This means the company would not be able to fully pay
its current obligations if they were to become immediately due. This could cause
problems with trade creditors and the company’s bank, which could lead to further
actions taken by those parties that could negatively affect the business.
The collection period for receivables has also slowed by 8 days from the previous
year, which indicates that it is taking longer to collect from customers. This trend will
further exacerbate any cash flow problems the company has in meeting its current
payment obligations. The actual collection period of 66 days may be reasonable,
but the company’s credit terms and general industry conditions would need to be
examined to see if this is in line with what is expected for this type of business.
The payment period for the company’s suppliers shows the most alarming trend.
The company is now taking 140 days to pay its payable, an increase of 20 days over
the previous year. This could indicate serious cash flow problems, and may cause
loss of credit with suppliers which could, ultimately, result in an inability to obtain
a supply of inventory. The standard credit terms offered by suppliers will need to
be examined to put this calculation into context. As well, the supplier list should
be examined to see if there are any related parties involved that are granting more
favourable credit terms than would be normally expected.
Overall, the company appears to have some problems in managing its working capital, which could lead to more serious liquidity problems in the future. The company
seems to be using trade creditors as its main source of short term financing, which
may cause a degrading of the company’s credit and reputation with those suppliers.
However, more information is required to fully understand these trends.

a. Financing is generally obtained through three sources: borrowing the funds, issuing
shares, and using internally generated funds. Using borrowed money to leverage,
where the interest rate from the borrowing is less than the return from generating

452

Solutions To Exercises

the profit, can maximize the returns paid to shareholders, and the related interest
paid is tax deductible. However, borrowed funds must be repaid, which affects the
company’s liquidity and solvency risk. Issuing shares, on the other hand, does
not impact liquidity and solvency risk, but it may result in the dilution of ownership
and associated lower market value and less dividends per share. Using internally
generated funds may be appropriate if the company has excess cash profits and
has determined that this project is the best use for these funds.
b. Based on the information provided, borrowing is the most suitable source of financing for Evergreen Ltd. With a debt to total assets ratio of 56%, Evergreen Ltd. is
underleveraged as compared with competitors operating in the same industry, averaging 60%. As a result, Evergreen Ltd. will likely be able to finance the expansion by
borrowing and still maintain an acceptable level of liquidity and solvency risk lower
than, or equal to, the 60% industry standard benchmark. If Evergreen Ltd. has
significant amounts of property, plant, and equipment, it may be able to obtain the
loan and secure it with its existing tangible assets. However, more information would
be required before making a concrete recommendation.

c. The market interest rate at the time of signing the note would have been 5% because
the note was issued at face value, meaning that the 5% stated rate was the same
as the market rate at that time.
d. The yield is the same as the market or effective rate, which is 5% in this case. Had
the market rate been greater or lower than the face rate, the yield would be equal to
the market rate.

e. The current portion of the long-term debt is the principal portion of the debt that
will be paid within one year of the reporting (balance sheet) date. In this case,
as no principal portions are due until the note’s maturity on January 1, 2019, no
amount will be reported as a current portion of long-term debt as at the December
31, 2016, reporting date. However, when the balance sheet at December 31, 2018,
is prepared, the long-term note payable of $400,000 will be classified as a current
liability because it will be due within one year of the December 31, 2018, reporting
date.

d. When a note or bond is issued, the brokerage fees and any other directly attributable
costs should be included in the fair value and amortized over the life of the debt.
As a result, these types of additional costs will affect both the amount of the bond
discount (or premium) amortized and the interest expense over the term of the bond.
Exceptions to this are where the debt will subsequently be measured at fair value
under the fair value option. In this case, the transaction costs would be expensed
at the time of issuance and not included in the initial fair value measurement. [CPA
Handbook, Accounting, Part II, Section 3856.07 and Part I, IFRS 9].

c. The risk for Tribecca increased in this case, so the fair value of its debt owing
decreased. The offsetting entry to the decrease (debit) to bonds payable is an
unrealized gain. An entry booking a gain seems like an illogical outcome, given that
the company is now worse off than before due to higher risk.

EXERCISE 13–13

a. Under IFRS, this debt is to be reported as a current liability on the December 31,
2016, financial statements because it was not refinanced by the reporting date.
The only exception is if the refinancing was done under an agreement that existed
at December 31, 2016, and the decision about the refinancing was solely up to
management’s discretion.
b. Under ASPE, this debt can be reported as a long-term liability because it has been
refinanced on a long-term basis before the financial statements are completed. In
this case, the entity’s financial statements are not yet finalized, so ASPE would
permit the debt to be included with long-term liabilities.

EXERCISE 13–14
Settlement or modification:
Old debt: $25,000 (amount due):
New annual interest payment: $18,000 × 6% = 1,080
New debt (PV using the old rate): PV (1,080 PMT, 8 I/Y, 3 N, 18,000 FV) = 17,072
The new debt is more than 10% difference of the old debt’s value, so the renegotiation
would be considered a settlement and not a modification in terms. A settlement requires
the old debt to be removed from the records and the present value amount of the note
payable with the new terms be recorded.
The PV of the new note payable at the current market rate would be:
PV (1080 PMT, 7 I/Y, 3 N, 18,000 FV) = 17,527.62
The entries would be:

b. The assessed value for the house of $590,000 is only a tax assessment notice for
purposes of tax levies and payments. Though it is intended to reflect some sort
of value of the house, it may not necessarily be an accurate measure. The more
accurate measure in this case would be the present value of the future cash flows
of the note, using a known, agreed-upon bank rate. The tax assessment amount
of $590,000 can be compared to the present value of $572,015 for consistency and
reasonableness. In this case, the amounts are close.

a. The purchase price of the equipment should be recorded at the present value of the
future cash flows of the instalment note at the imputed interest rate of 7%. This is
the best measure of the fair value of the asset because it represents the present
value of an agreed series of future cash flows at a known market rate. The listing
price represents a tentative amount asked for the equipment and could be above or
below the price that is agreed to between both parties.

c. From the perspective of a creditor, an instalment note payment includes both the
interest and principal, whereas, for an interest-bearing note, the principal amount
is not due until maturity. In other words, the instalment note provides a regular
reduction of the principal balance as part of every payment received, reducing the
creditor’s investment in the debt and freeing up cash to use elsewhere.

EXERCISE 13–17
For Hornblower Corp.:
a. Determine if this is a modification of terms or settlement:
Present value of old debt is $700,000.
Present value of new debt using the historic rate:
PV = (45,500 PMT, 8 I/Y, 2 N, 650,000 FV) = 638,409
This loan is deemed as a modification in terms because the present value of the
future cash flows of the new debt using the old rate of $638,409 does not differ by
an amount greater than 10% of the present value of the old debt of $700,000.
There will be no entry for Hornblower Corp. due to the restructure of the loan. The
old debt remains on the books of Hornblower Corp. at $700,000 and no gain or loss
is recognized. A note disclosure regarding the modification of terms is required.

New terms using old rate of 10%:
PV = (11,700 PMT, 10 I/Y, 2 N, 130,000 FV) = 127,744
The present value of the new terms using the old rate of 10% differs by an amount
larger than 10% of the present value of the old debt of $150,000. As a result,
the renegotiated debt is considered a settlement. The old debt is removed from the
books of Ulting Ltd. with a gain/loss being recognized, and the new debt is recorded.

b. Under ASPE one option is to measure the component that is most easily measurable first (usually the debt component) and apply the residual to the other equity
component. This is the option under IFRS, and the journal entry will, therefore, be
the same:

Another option is to measure the equity component using the zero-equity method.
This means that equity is measured at $0 and the journal entry would be:

c. Allocating the entire issuance to the debt component, and therefore zero to equity,
results in a higher debt to total assets ratio as compared with the residual method.
A lower debt to total assets ratio indicates better debt paying ability and long-run
solvency.

Note: The bonds payable carrying value would no longer include any unamortized premium, so the
face value or par value would be the carrying value at maturity.

c. Due to common shares market price volatility, there is a risk in waiting to convert the
bonds. If the bondholder does not convert when the common share market value
is high, no gain will be realized. Conversely, if the common shares market price
declines too far, the bondholder risks not being able to sell the bonds, rendering the
conversion rights worthless.

b. The market price of the shares of $15 on May 1, 2018, is not used in recording the
exercise of the stock options. From an accounting perspective, the market price is
not relevant. It is, nonetheless, relevant to the employees in making their decision
to exercise their stock options. The market price is mentioned to indicate that the
timing of the exercise is justified, or at least makes sense. Employees exercising a
stock option would have paid $10 and could resell the shares immediately for $15,
for a gain of $5 per share.

a. Opening deferred tax liability balance of $17,500 implies an opening temporary
difference of (17,500 ÷ 25%) = $70,000. If the carrying amount at 31 December
2016 was $320,000, then the tax base must have been (320,000 − 70,000) =
$250,000.

At 31 December 2017, the carrying amount will be (320,000 − 50,000) = $270,000
At 31 December 2017, the tax base will be (250,000 − 58,000) = $192,000

Note: The deferred tax resulting from the rate change is calculated as the opening temporary difference from 2016 multiplied by the rate differential: $15,000 ×
(23% − 20%) = $450. The deferred tax resulting from temporary differences is
calculated as the current year temporary differences multiplied by the current rate:
$36,000 × 23% = $8,280. Deferred tax adjustments resulting from rate changes
must be disclosed separately from deferred tax adjustments resulting from changes

No j/e in 2018 for the benefit of the loss carry forward, as the asset is not recognized.
However, disclosure will be made of the unrecorded carry forward amount (47,000).
No j/e in 2019, as current tax will be 0 and no deferred tax asset will be established.
However, disclosure is required of the current tax expense components:
Current tax expense 21,000 × 18%
Less benefit of loss carried forward

In 2019, management’s estimate of its ability to utilize the tax losses has dropped
to 10%, which means it is no longer probable that the asset can be realized. At this
point, the asset should be derecognized.
In 2020, the balance of the loss ($295,000) can be fully used against current taxable
profit ($345,000). In 2020, the company will record current tax income of $295,000×

Solutions To Exercises

30% = $88,500. This will offset the current tax expense of $345,000 × 30% =
$103,500, leaving a net current tax expense of $15,000. Although there is no
deferred tax adjustment as the asset was previously derecognized, disclosure of
the two different components of current tax expense will be required.

Remeasurement gains are derived by working backwards from the ending balances
of the DBO and plan assets. No interest is calculated as the opening balances were
zero and it is assumed that transactions occur at the end of the period.

The post-employment health benefit expense will be $688,100 for the year. Note
that the interest on the health benefit obligation is calculated after taking the past
service adjustment into account. This is necessary as the past service adjustment
was made on January 1.
b. The company will report a non-current asset of $366,900, subject to any adjustment
required as a result of the asset ceiling test.

No accumulated other comprehensive income is reported. The remeasurement
losses would simply be included in retained earnings through the closing of the
pension expense account at the end of the year.

Chapter 17 Solutions
EXERCISE 17–1

a. Lessee analysis (ASPE):
• Does ownership title pass? No, title remains with the lessor.

500

Solutions To Exercises

• Is there a BPO or a bargain renewal option? Yes
• Is the lease term 75% or more of the asset’s estimated economic or useful life?
No
6 years/10 years = 60%, which does not meet the 75% threshold
• Does the present value of the minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the
leased asset’s fair value? Yes, as calculated below.
Present value of minimum lease payments:
PV = (25,100 PMT/AD, 7 I/Y, 6 N, 3,000 FV) = $130,014 (rounded)
ASPE interest rate used must be the lower of the two rates, since both are
known.
The present value compared to the fair value of $130,000 exceeds the 90%
numeric threshold. Note that the leased asset and obligation cannot exceed
fair value, so $130,000 will be the amount used as the valuation in the journal
entries below.
Any one of the criteria met will result in a classification of a capital lease. In this
case, the lease agreement has met two criteria: a bargain purchase option, and a
present value of the minimum lease payments that exceeds 90% of the fair value of
the asset.
Lessor Analysis (ASPE)
The lease agreement meets the capitalization criteria for the lessee above. Additionally, there are no uncertainties regarding the collectability of the lease payments and
the costs yet to be incurred by the lessor (both must be met). This would, therefore,
be classified as a capital lease for the lessor. The initial amount of net investment
(fair value) of $130,000 exceeds the lessor’s cost of $90,000, making the lease a
sales-type lease to the lessor.
b. Gross investment (lease receivable) for the lessor:
The minimum lease payments regarding this lease are:

* Note: The lease valuation is limited to its fair value of $130,000 instead of the
present value of $130,014. The difference ($14) is insignificant, thus a new interest
rate is not required for the amortization schedule above. Had the present value been
significantly higher than the fair value, a new effective interest rate would be required
and calculated using the following methodology.
I/Y = (+/- 130,000 PV, 25,100 PMT/AD, 6 N, 3,000 FV) = 7.004876% or 7%
As can be seen, the 7% rate for the lessor has not significantly changed, so 7% will
be the rate used in the amortization schedule above.

price at that time, will be exercised by the lessee and the asset will be used beyond the lease term.

Note: The lessor could record six months of interest income in July, and six months
of interest income on December 31 to match the lessee interest entries. However,
the minimum reporting requirement would be to recognize interest income each
reporting date (December 31). If the lessor also had interim reporting every six
months within the fiscal year, interest income would be accrued every six months to
ensure that both the interim and year-end financial statements were complete.
f. For the lessee:
Rather than using quantitative factors, such as the 75% and the 90% hurdles, the
IFRS (IAS 17) criteria use qualitative factors to establish whether the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the lessee, which supports the classification
as a capitalized lease:
• There is reasonable assurance that the lessee will obtain ownership of the
leased property by the end of the lease term. If there is a bargain purchase
option in the lease, it is assumed that the lessee will exercise it and obtain
ownership of the asset (same as with ASPE).
• The lease term is long enough that the lessee will receive substantially all of
the economic benefits that are expected to be derived from using the leased
property over its life (equivalent to the 75% numeric threshold for ASPE).
• The lease allows the lessor to recover substantially all of its investment in the
leased property and to earn a return on the investment. Evidence of this is
provided if the present value of the minimum lease payments is close to the fair
value of the leased asset (equivalent to the 90% numeric threshold for ASPE).

504

Solutions To Exercises

• The leased assets are so specialized that, without major modification, they are
of use only to the lessee (IFRS (IAS 17) only).
If the lease is deemed as a lease subject to capitalization, the accounting treatment
of the lease by the lessee would be the same as ASPE, although it would be referred
to as a finance lease, rather than a capital, direct financing lease.
The treatment of the lease by the lessor would be the same as the lessee above,
using qualitative criteria rather than numeric thresholds used for ASPE. (The criteria
will not include the two-revenue recognition-based tests for uncertainty regarding
collectability of lease payments and estimated un-reimbursable costs for the lessor.)
The lease would be referred to as a finance lease, manufacturer or dealer rather
than a sales-type lease.
g. If the lease agreement included an unguaranteed residual, the leased asset would
be physically returned to the lessor at the end of the lease term. The depreciation
charge would, therefore, be over the lease term and not the asset’s economic life,
which is the case when a bargain purchase is involved. As well, the depreciation
calculation would not include a residual value.

EXERCISE 17–2

a. Lessee analysis (IFRS, IAS 17)
• Does ownership title pass? No, title remains with the lessor.
• Is there a BPO or a bargain renewal option? No
• Is the lease term covering the majority of the asset’s estimated economic or
useful life? Consider that the lease term is eight years and the economic life
is ten years, so this constitutes a major part of the economic life of the asset.
Yes, capitalize leased asset.
• The leased asset is a specialized piece of landscaping machinery, so it will only
benefit the lessee without major modifications. Yes, capitalize leased asset.
• Does the present value of the minimum lease payments allow the lessor to
recover substantially all of the leased asset’s fair value as well as realizing a
return on the investment? Consider that the present value of the minimum
lease payments shown below is nearly equal to the fair value of $270,000, so
it appears that the lessor will be reimbursed for all of the leased investment,
including a return on investment. Yes, capitalize leased asset.
Present value calculation:

Chapter 17 Solutions
Yearly payment
Less: Executory costs
Minimum annual lease payment

505

$46,754
2,000
$44,754

Present value of minimum lease payments:
PV = (44,754 PMT/AD, 9 I/Y, 8 N, 0 FV) = $269,999 (which is virtually 100% of
the fair value of $270,000)
Under IFRS (IAS 17), the lessee will classify this lease as a finance lease since
the lease term covers substantially all of the asset’s useful life, the present value of
the minimum lease payments allows the lessor to recover almost all of the leased
asset’s fair value (as well as realizing a return on the investment), and the machinery
is highly specialized. Three of the criteria considered were met so it is reasonable
to assume that the lessee will capitalize the lease.
The treatment of the lease by the lessor would be the same as the lessee above,
using the qualitative criteria rather than numeric thresholds used for ASPE. Except
the lessor classification criteria will not include the two-revenue recognition-based
tests for uncertainty regarding collectability of lease payments and estimated unreimbursable costs for the lessor. Again, since three criteria were met, it is reasonable to assume that the lease would be classified as a finance lease.
b. IFRS (IAS 17) states that the rate implicit in the lease is to be used wherever it is
reasonably determinable. Using the fair value of $270,000, the implicit rate can be
calculated:
I/Y = (+/- 270,000 PV, 44,754 PMT/AD, 8 N) = 9% (rounded) which is the same rate
as the lessee’s

• Does the ownership title pass? No, title remains with the lessor.
• Is there a BPO or a bargain renewal option? No
• Does the lease term cover the majority of the asset’s estimated economic or useful

• As the leased asset is a specialized piece of landscaping machinery, it will only

• Does the present value of the minimum lease payments allow the lessor to recover
substantially all of the leased asset’s fair value, as well as realizing a return on
the investment? Consider that the present value of the minimum lease payments
is $288,960, compared to the fair value of $300,000, making the minimum lease

payments nearly equal to the fair value at that date. As such, the lessor will recover
substantially all of the leased asset’s fair value, as well as a return of 9% on the
investment. Yes, as calculated below.
Present value calculation:
Yearly payment
Less: Executory costs
Minimum annual lease payment

$50,397

$47,897

Present value of minimum lease payments:
PV = (47,897 PMT/AD, 9 I/Y, 8 N, 0 FV) = 288,960 (which is substantially most of
the fair value of $300,000)
Consider the following criteria: The lease term covers substantially all of the asset’s
useful life, the present value of the minimum lease payments recovers substantially
most of the leased asset’s fair value (as well as realizing a return on the investment),
and the machinery is highly specialized for the lessee. As these three factors have
been met, it is reasonable to assume that the lease will be classified as a finance
lease for the lessee under IFRS (IAS 17).

EXERCISE 17–4
a. This is a finance lease to Oberton Ltd. The IFRS (IAS 17) criteria use qualitative
factors to establish whether the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to
the lessee, and supports classification as a finance lease:
1. There is reasonable assurance that the lessee will obtain ownership of the
leased property by the end of the lease term. If there is a bargain purchase
option in the lease, it is assumed that the lessee will exercise it and obtain
ownership of the asset. No

510

Solutions To Exercises

2. The lease term is long enough that the lessee will receive substantially all of
the economic benefits that are expected to be derived from using the leased
property over its life (as evidenced by a four-year lease compared to a six-year
estimated economic life). Yes, this represents a major part of the economic life
of the asset.
3. The lease allows the lessor to recover substantially all of its investment in the
leased property and to earn a return on the investment. Evidence of this is
provided if the present value of the minimum lease payments is close to the fair
value of the leased asset. Yes
PV = (4,313 PMT/AD excl. executory costs, 8 I/Y, 4 N, 3,500 guaranteed residual) = 18,000
Compared to a fair value of $18,000 = 100% recovery of investment + an 8%
return on investment.
4. The leased assets are so specialized that, without major modification and/or
significant cost to the lessor, they are of use only to the lessee. No
The standard also states that these indicators are not always conclusive. The
decision has to be made on the substance of each specific transaction. If the lessee
determines that the risks and benefits of ownership have not been transferred to it,
the lease is classified as an operating lease. In this case, two factors have been met
so it would be reasonable to classify this lease as a finance lease for the lessee.
For Black Ltd. (the lessor) under IFRS (IAS 17), the lease would receive the same
treatment as for the lessee using the qualitative factors. Black Ltd. reasonably meets
the factors, and is not a manufacturer or dealer, and so this is a finance lease.
b. Calculation of annual rental payment:
PMT = +/- 18,000 PV, 8 I/Y, 4 N, 3,500 FV = $4,313 + $20 executory costs = $4,333
lease payment, including executory costs of $20.
This confirms that the interest rate used to calculate the lease payment was 8% per
annum.

a. Lessor Analysis (ASPE)
The lease is a capital lease for the following reasons: the lease term exceeds 75%
of the asset’s estimated economic life (10 ÷ 12 years = 83%), the collectability
of payments is reasonably assured, and there are no further costs to be incurred.
Furthermore, it is a sales-type lease because Helmac Ltd. will realize a gross profit
of $199,122 ($283,774 − $84,652) in addition to the financing charge of $75,878 to
be amortized over the lease term using the effective interest method.

Note: The unguaranteed residual value is included in the lessor’s gross investment even though the
lessee does not guarantee it. From the lessor’s perspective, it anticipates receiving $25,000 from a
third party at the end of the lease term and it does not matter who they receive it from.
** The residual value is unguaranteed, so its present value must be removed from the sale price to
the lessee.
Present value of the minimum lease payments = (35,000 PMT/AD, 5 I/Y, 10 N, 25,000 FV) = $299,122
Sales price ($299,122 − $15,348) = $283,774 OR remove the $25,000 residual value from the
present value calculation above.
PV = (35,000 PMT/AD, 5 I/Y, 10 N) = $283,774

The sales revenue and cost of goods sold would not need to be reduced by the
present value of the estimated residual value ($15,348) calculated in part (b). The
sales revenue would, therefore, be the amount equalling the present value of the
minimum lease payments.
d. Lease payment PMT/AD = (299,122 PV, 5 I/Y, 12 N, 40,000 FV) = $29,748 (rounded)

EXERCISE 17–6

a. Lessee Analysis (ASPE)
• Does ownership title pass? Yes, legal title passes to the lessee at the end of
the lease term.
• Is there a BPO or a bargain renewal option? N/A, title passes, so BPO is not
relevant.
• Is the lease term 75% or more of the asset’s estimated economic or useful life?
Yes
10 years/10 years = 100% which meets the 75% threshold

Chapter 17 Solutions

515

• Does the present value of the minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the
leased asset’s fair value? Yes, as calculated below.
Present value of minimum lease payments:
PV = (61,507 PMT/A, 7 I/Y, 10 N, 0 FV) = $432,000 (rounded)
The ASPE interest rate used must be the lower of the two, since both are
known.
The present value is equal to the fair value of $432,000, so it exceeds the 90%
numeric threshold.
Any one of the criteria met will result in a classification of a capital lease for
the lessee. In this case, the lease agreement has met three criteria: legal title
passes to the lessee, a lease term that exceeds 75% of the estimated economic
life of the leased asset, and a present value of the minimum lease payments
that exceeds 90% of the fair value of the asset.
Lessor Analysis (ASPE)
The lease agreement meets the capitalization criteria for the lessee above. In
addition, there are no uncertainties regarding the collectability of the lease payments
or the costs yet to be incurred by the lessor (both must be met). This would,
therefore, be classified as a capital lease for the lessor. Additionally, as the lessor
is a financing company this lease would be classified as a direct-financing lease by
the lessor.

Note: The present value calculation in this case will involve the annual payment
(PMT) of an ordinary annuity (paid at the end of each year) for 10 periods at 7%.
The interest rate under ASPE is to be the lower of the two rates, if both are known.
Earlier leasing questions involved the annual payment of an annuity due at the
beginning of each year over the lease term.

Note: The basic preferred dividend is calculated as before. Then, a like amount is
allocated to the common shares. The preferred dividend can be expressed as a
percentage: $150,000 ÷ $5,000,000 = 3% (or $3 ÷ $100). Therefore, the common
shares are also allocated a basic dividend of (3% × $8,000,000) = $240,000. This
leaves a remaining dividend of $510,000, which is available for participation. The
participation is allocated on a pro-rata basis as follows:
Carrying amounts of each class:

EXERCISE 18–9
a. Implied value of the company before the dividend:
5,000,000 shares × $12 = $60,000,000
50% share dividend would issue an additional 5,000,000 ×50% = 2,500,000 shares
The ex-dividend price should be $60,000,000 ÷ 7,500,000 = $8 per share
A 3-for-2 share split results in the same number of shares being issued as above,
making the share price $8.

Chapter 18 Solutions

523

b. For the 50% share dividend, the dividend amount will be calculated as 2,500,000 ×
$8 = $20,000,000
Therefore, after the dividend, the equity section will appear as follows:
Common shares
Retained earnings
Total equity

$32,500,000
22,000,000
$54,500,000

A 3-for-2 share split has no effect on the accounts, as it simply increases the number
of outstanding shares. Therefore, the equity section will appear as follows:
Common shares
Retained earnings
Total equity

$12,500,000
42,000,000
$54,500,000

c. Either action will result in the share price dropping to $8 per share from $12. However, the total reported equity will not change as it’s just a question of how the deck
will be shuffled, so to speak, in the equity section. The decision will depend on both
the legal framework in the company’s jurisdiction and the corporate objectives of the
distribution. There may be legal restrictions and tax implications, with respect to
the share dividend, which would make the share split easier to implement. On the
other hand, if the directors would like to capitalize some of the retained earnings
to potentially reduce future shareholder demands for dividends, then the share
dividend would be the better approach. The directors will also have to consider if the
shareholder response will be different for each scenario. The directors should also
consider if there are any other contracts or agreements, such as loan covenants,
that would be affected by the decision.

Common dividend: (250,000 − 30,000 − 50,000) × 5% × $17 = $144,500
Note: The shares remaining in treasury are excluded from the dividend calculation, as the
company cannot pay itself a dividend. The company’s issued share capital includes the
treasury shares, although they are not outstanding.

Chapter 19 Solutions

Preferred dividend: (75,000 − 25,000) × $1 × 3 years = $150,000
Note: This calculation assumes that the cumulative, unpaid dividend on the retired preferred shares was not paid. Depending on the articles of incorporation and local legislation, the cumulative, unpaid dividend may need to be paid prior to retirement of the
shares. This would result in an additional dividend of $50,000 (25,000 × $1 × 2) paid on
the date of retirement.

a. Basic earnings per share calculation:
Step 1: Record the opening balance of shares outstanding and each subsequent
event, date, description, and number of shares for the current reporting. An event is
where the outstanding number of shares changes.
Step 2: For stock dividends or stock splits, apply the required retroactive restatement factor(s) from the event point when it initially occurs and backwards to the
beginning of the fiscal year.
Step 3: For each event, complete the duration between events under the date
column and complete the corresponding fraction of the year column accordingly.
Multiply the shares outstanding times the retroactive restatement factor(s) times
the fraction of the year for each event. Sum the amounts to determine the WACS
amount.

b. Common shareholders need to know how much of a company’s available income
can be attributed to the shares they own. This helps them assess future dividend
payouts and the value of each share. Earnings per share (EPS) becomes a per
share way of describing net income, making EPS a good metric for shareholders
and investors. When the income statement reports discontinued operations, EPS
should be disclosed for income from continuing operations, discontinued operations,
and net income. These disclosures make it possible for shareholders and potential
investors to know the specific impact of income from continuing operations on earnings per share, as opposed to a single EPS number, that includes income or loss
from non-continuing operations not expected to continue.

Chapter 19 Solutions

529

c. EPS is used in the calculation of the price earnings ratio (market price of shares ÷
EPS), which compares the market price of the company’s shares with income generated on a per-share basis. Market price of the company’s shares will generally
adjust after issuance of a stock dividend or a stock split. For the calculation of price
earnings ratio to remain valid after a stock dividend or stock split, EPS should also
be adjusted in the company’s financial statements to assume that the additional
shares have been outstanding since the beginning of the year in which the stock
dividend or stock split occurred.

EXERCISE 19–2
Step 1: Record the opening balance of shares outstanding and each subsequent event,
date, description, and number of shares for the current reporting. An event is where the
outstanding number of shares changes.
Step 2: For stock dividends or stock splits, apply the required retroactive restatement
factor(s) from the event point it when initially occurs and backwards to the beginning of
the fiscal year.
Step 3: For each event, complete the duration between events under the date column and
complete the corresponding fraction of the year column accordingly. Multiply the shares
outstanding times the retroactive restatement factor(s) times the fraction of the year for
each event. Sum the amounts to determine the WACS amount.

e. The earnings process occurs continuously throughout the fiscal year and the capital
basis can fluctuate during that time. It is, therefore, necessary to adjust the denominator of the EPS ratio to reflect the various lengths of time during the year that the
different amounts of capital from the different number of shares outstanding were
available to generate earnings during the year.

EXERCISE 19–4

a. Basic earnings per share = $385,000 ÷ 700,000 = $0.55
Diluted EPS:
Bonds interest saved $757,232 × 6% × (1 − 0.25) × 6 ÷ 12 = $17,038
Additional shares $800,000 ÷ $1,000 × 100 × 6 ÷ 12 = 40,000 shares
Individual effect 17,038 ÷ 40,000 = $0.43 therefore, dilutive
Diluted EPS = ($385,000 + 17,038) ÷ (700,000 + 40,000) = 0.5433 = $0.54

Basic EPS = ($4,500,000 − 240,000)* ÷ 1,066,667 = $3.99
* (40,000 × $6) = $240,000

Note that the preferred shares are not convertible, so this company has a simple
capital structure and needs only report its basic EPS.
b. The basic EPS will remain the same as the amount calculated in part (a). This is
because the preferred shares are cumulative, so the dividend entitlement amount
would be used to reduce the income available to common shareholders. For this
reason, any dividends in arrears will not be included, since they would have already
been included in the previous years’ respective EPS calculations. To include dividends in arrears for cumulative preferred shares in 2016 would be, in effect, double
counting.

Chapter 19 Solutions

533

c. The basic EPS will be the same amount as calculated in part (a). If the preferred
shares are non-cumulative, only dividends that are declared are deducted from net
income. Since they are paid up to date, they will be the same amount as the dividend
amount used in part (a), making the EPS calculation the same.
d. If the preferred shares are non-cumulative, only dividends declared would be used
in the numerator to reduce net income available to common shareholders. In this
case, no dividends were declared in 2016, so the calculation would be:
Basic EPS = ($4,500,000) ÷ 1,066,667 = $4.22
e. A stock split, which only increases the number of shares outstanding, will result in a
decreased market price per share, making the shares more affordable to potential
investors. If the company’s shares are made more affordable to potential investors,
the shares may become more marketable, causing an increase in the market value
because of the stock split.
f. The weighted average number of shares outstanding provides the correct basis for
EPS to be reported because the number of common shares outstanding throughout
the year can fluctuate due to various in-year capital transactions. When stock
dividends or stock splits occur, a restatement of the weighted average number of
shares to the beginning of the year must be made. This is done to allow valid
comparisons can be made between periods before and after the stock dividend or
stock split.

EXERCISE 19–6
a. This company has a complex capital structure because it has options that can
potentially be converted into common shares. Both basic and diluted EPS are
required to be disclosed, even if the amounts are the same.
b. Basic EPS = $350,000 ÷ 200,000 = $1.75
Diluted EPS = $350,000 ÷ 200,000 + 4,091* = $1.71
* Additional common shares using the treasury method:
Shares purchased
Less shares retired (45,000 × $10) ÷ $11
Net additional shares

Note: A quick way to calculate the net additional common shares due to options

c. Basic EPS = $350,000 ÷ 200,000 = $1.75
Diluted EPS = $1.75
Options are not in the money because the market price is $9, and the exercise price
is $10. Options holders would not be motivated to purchase any common shares
using their options because they can buy them directly from the market at a lower
price.
Required disclosures:
Basic and diluted EPS

$1.75

EXERCISE 19–7
a. There will be no incremental shares in this case as these options are anti-dilutive.
Recall that only an increase in additional shares will be dilutive since the net income
(numerator) will remain unchanged. If call options have an exercise price ($10)
that is lower than the market price ($13), these options will be anti-dilutive, as fewer
shares will need to be issued (at $13) in order to obtain sufficient cash to exercise the
options to purchase the 20,000 shares at $10. The net result would be a reduction
of 4,615 outstanding shares, making these options anti-dilutive as calculated below:
Shares issued at $13 to obtain $200,000
Using proceeds to exercise options at $10 per share

15,385 increase
20,000 reduction

As this results in a net reduction of 4,615 common shares, these options are considered anti-dilutive and would be excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
b.

Shares issued at $13 to obtain $280,000

$280,000
21,538 increase

Using proceeds to exercise options at $14 per share

20,000 reduction

Chapter 19 Solutions

535

There is a net increase of 1,538 common shares, making this dilutive. The diluted
EPS calculation would include the additional 1,538 common shares.
If the exercise price is $12 instead of $14:
Proceeds required to exercise options (20,000 × $12)
Shares issued at $13 to obtain $240,000
Using proceeds to exercise options at $12 per share

$240,000
18,462 increase
20,000 reduction

There is a net decrease of 1,538 common shares, making this anti-dilutive and,
therefore, excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
c. The company would not exercise the option to sell its common shares for $11
because the option price per share of $11 is lower than the market price of $13.
These are, therefore, not dilutive.

EXERCISE 19–8

a. Basic EPS = $400,000 − 10,000* ÷ 60,000 = $6.50
* $50,000 ÷ $100 = 500 shares × $20 = $10,000 dividend annual entitlement

This company has a complex capital structure due to the convertible securities. As
a result, diluted EPS is also required to be calculated and reported.
Individual effects:

b. Discontinued operations gain before tax $20,000
Discontinued operations gain, net of tax ($20,000 − (1 − 0.24)) = $15,200
Net income from continuing operations = $400,000 − $15,200 = $384,800
Basic EPS, continuing operations = $384,800 − 10,000 ÷ 60,000 = $6.25
Both the bonds and preferred shares remain dilutive with the same ranking as in

Solutions To Exercises

Supplemental Disclosures:
1. The purchase of equipment through the issuance of $50,000 of common shares
is a significant non-cash financing transaction that would be disclosed in the
notes to the financial statements.
Cash paid interest

$35,000

2. Note: Had there been cash paid income taxes, this would also be disclosed.
b. Free cash flow:
Net cash from operating activities
Capital expenditures – land
Cash paid dividends
Free cash flow

$ 181,600
(220,000)
(8,000)
$ (46,400)

In the analysis of Carmel’s free cash flow above, we see that it is negative. While
including dividends paid is optional, it would not have made a difference in this
case. What does make a difference, however, is that the capital expenditures are
those needed to sustain the current level of operations. In the case of Carmel
Corp., the land was purchased for investment purposes, and not to meet operational
requirements. With this in mind, the free cash flow would more accurately be:
Net cash from operating activities
Capital purchases
Cash paid dividends
Free cash flow

$181,600
0
(8,000)
$173,600

This makes intuitive sense and it is supported by the results from one of the coverage ratios.
The current cash debt coverage provides information about how well Carmel Corp.
can cover its current liabilities from its net cash flows from operations:
Net cash from operating activities
Average current liabilities
Carmel Corp.’s current cash debt coverage is 1.38 ($181,600÷((87,200+176,000)×
50%)). The company has adequate cash flows to cover its current liabilities as they
come due and so, overall, its financial flexibility looks positive.
In terms of cash flow patterns, we see a positive trend, as Carmel Corp. has managed to more than triple its cash balance in the year, mainly from cash generated
from operating activities. They were able to pay $8,000 in dividends, or a 1.7%
return. And if dividends are paid several times throughout the year, then the return is
more than adequate for investors. Carmel Corp. also sold off its traded investments

Chapter 20 Solutions

545

for a profit, and some idle buildings at a small loss, to obtain sufficient internal
funding for some land that they want to purchase as an investment. They also
managed to lower their accounts payable levels by close to 60%. All of this supports
the assessment that Carmel Corp.’s financial flexibility looks reasonable.
c. The information reported in the statement of cash flows is useful for assessing the
amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. The statement identifies the
specific cash inflows and outflows from operating activities, investing activities, and
financing activities. This gives stakeholders a better understanding of the liquidity
and financial flexibility of the enterprise. Some stakeholders have concerns about
the quality of the earnings because of the variety and subjectivity of the bases that
can be used to record accruals and estimates. As a result, the higher the ratio of
cash provided by operating activities to net income, the more stakeholders can rely
on the earnings reported.

General note: During the year, Egglestone Vibe retired $160,000 in notes payable
by issuing common shares.
Notes to statements:
1. $111,800 − $15,600 + X = $152,100; X = $55,900
2. $27,300 − ($53,000 − $15,600)
3. $150,000 − $111,800
4. $133,900 − 111,800 + X = $84,500
5. Retained earnings account: $370,200 + $24,700 − X = $374,400; Dividend
declared but not paid = $20,500
Dividends payable account: $41,600 +$20,500−$19,500 = $42,600 cash paid
dividends
b. Negative cash flows from operating activities may signal trouble ahead with regard to
Egglestone’s daily operations, including profitability of operations and management
of its current assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable.
All three of these increased the cash outflows over the year. In fact, net cash
provided by investing activities funded the net cash used by both operating and
financing activities. Specifically, proceeds from sale of equipment and land were
used to fund operating and financing activities, which may be cause for concern if
the assets sold were used to generate significant revenue. Shareholders did receive
cash dividends, but investors may wonder if these payments will be sustainable over
the long term. Consider that dividends declared were $20,500, which was quite
high compared to the net income of $24,700. In addition, the dividends payable
account still had a balance payable of $41,600 from prior dividend declarations not
yet paid. This creates increased pressure on the company to find sufficient funds
to catch-up with the cash payments owed to investors. Egglestone may not be able
to sustain payment of cash dividends of this size in the long-term if improvement of
its profitability and management of its receivables, payables, and inventory are not
implemented quickly.

Solutions To Exercises

Supplemental Disclosures:
Cash paid interest and income taxes are already reported as categories in operating
activities when using the direct method. Only the non-cash items require supplementary disclosure (below).
Non-cash:
Machinery for $394,250 ($918,750 − $125,000 − $1,188,000) was purchased in
exchange for $166,000 in common shares and $228,250 in cash.
Solution Notes:
* Bond amortization is a non-cash adjusting entry that affects interest expense in the income statement, therefore net income must be adjusted by $54,750 ($1,089,000 − $1,034,250) bond amounts,
net of discount.
** Deferred tax is a non-cash transaction affecting income tax expense in the income statement,
therefore net income must be adjusted by $42,900 ($69,300 − $26,400).
*** The change in investments held for trading is due to the unrealized loss included in the income
statement. This has already been adjusted in step 3, so no further action is required. Memo item

* Bond amortization is a non-cash adjusting entry that affects interest expense in the income statement and is not included in the adjustments. Net income must, therefore, be adjusted by $54,750
($1,089,000 − $1,034,250) bond amounts, net of discount.
** Deferred tax is a non-cash transaction affecting income tax expense in the income statement and
is not included in the adjustments. Net income must, therefore, be adjusted by $42,900 ($69,300 −
$26,400).
*** The change in investments held for trading asset account is due to the unrealized loss included
in the income statement.

Item
The useful life of a piece of equipment was revised from five years to six years.
An accrued litigation liability was adjusted upwards once the lawsuit was concluded.
An item was missed in the year-end inventory count.
The method used to depreciate a factory machine was changed from straight-line to
declining balance as it was felt this better reflected the pattern of use.
A company adopted the new IFRS for revenue recognition.
The accrued pension liability was adjusted downwards as the company’s actuary
had not included one employee group when estimating the remaining service life.
The allowance for doubtful accounts was adjusted upwards due to current economic
conditions.
The allowance for doubtful accounts was adjusted downwards because the previous
estimate was based on an aged trial balance that classified some outstanding
invoices into the wrong aging categories.
A company changed its inventory cost flow assumption from LIFO to FIFO, as the
newly appointed auditors indicated that LIFO was not allowable under IFRS.
A company began to apply the revaluation model to certain property, plant, and
equipment assets, as it was felt this presentation would be more useful to investors.

EXERCISE 21–2

a. Because the change in the useful life of the copyright is based on the existence
of new information and new conditions, this would be a change in estimate and
should be treated prospectively by adjusting amortization only for current and future
years. The recording of the insurance premium is an accounting error as it should
have originally been recorded as a prepaid expense. As such, this error should
be accounted for retrospectively, correcting the error in the appropriate period and
restating comparative information.
b. Original amortization = (100,000 − 10,000) ÷ 10 years = 9,000 per year
Amortization to 1 January 2016 = 9,000 × 3 years = 27,000
NBV at 1 January 2016 = (100,000 − 27,000) = 73,000
New rate = 73,000 ÷ 2 years = 36,500 per year

Solutions To Exercises

Note: Because the books are still open for 2016, we can correct the error for the
current year as well as for the future year. However, the company would have to
consider when the conditions changed that led to the estimate revision.

The insurance premium should have been reported as a prepaid asset when purchased, and recognized as an expense at $1,500 ÷ 12 = $125 per month. Thus,
for the year ended December 31, 2015, only $125 × 2 = $250 should have been
expensed. The following adjustment is required to correct this error:

Note that this entry simply moves ten months of the insurance expense from 2015
to 2016. There is no need to adjust the prepaid as the insurance was fully utilized by
the end of 2016. However, a comparative balance sheet, if presented, would need
to include the prepaid expense of $1,250.

EXERCISE 21–3
In this case, there is both an accounting error and a change in accounting estimate. The
error should be corrected first, retrospectively, and then the change in estimate can be
applied.
Depreciation as originally calculated: $50,000 ÷ 5 years = $10,000 per year
Depreciation should have been: $50,000 − $5,000 ÷ 5 years = $9,000 per year

The carrying amount is now $50,000 − $10,000 + $1,000 = $41,000
Double declining balance rate = (1 ÷ 4) × 2 = 50%, which is determined by the remaining
useful life of 4 years.
Therefore, 2017 depreciation will be $41,000 × 50% = $20,500

Note: On December 31, 2013, the building is revalued, creating a revaluation surplus
of 75,000 (800,000 − 725,000). The revised depreciation is calculated as 800,000 ÷
29 years = 27,586. This depreciation rate is used for 2014 and 2015. On December 31,
2015, the building is revalued creating a valuation surplus of 80,172 (825,000 − 744,828).
The new depreciation rate to be used for 2016 and 2017 is 825,000 ÷ 27 years = 30,556.
On January 1, 2017, the total depreciation actually recorded is $100,000 (25,000 × 4).
Total depreciation that would have been recorded under the revaluation model is $110,728
(25,000 + 27,586 + 27,586 + 30,556). The additional depreciation of 10,728 (110,728 −
100,000) needs to be adjusted to retained earnings. As well, the two revaluation surplus amounts 155,172 (80,172 + 75,000) need to be reflected in the revaluation surplus
account.
The following journal entry adjusts the opening balances on January 1, 2017:

Note: Remember that when using the revaluation model, previous accumulated depreciation amounts are eliminated when a revaluation occurs. Thus, the accumulated depreciation on December 31, 2016, would be $30,556, so the adjustment needs to be 69,444
(100,000 − 30,556). The building cost adjustment is based on the revised value (825,000)
less the original cost recorded (750,000). This solution also assumes that there is no
reclassification of OCI to retained earnings, as this is an optional treatment.
In 2017, the depreciation would be recorded as follows:

* The account used here will depend on whether the company uses a perpetual or periodic inventory
system. With a periodic system, opening inventory is adjusted. With a perpetual system, cost of
sales would be adjusted.

Note: Only the effect in 2015 needs to be considered. Inventory adjustments are
self-correcting over a two-year period, so only the difference in the 2015 ending
inventory needs to be adjusted.
b. The comparative column (2015) of the retained earnings statement would look like
this:

Opening retained earnings as previously stated

difference on December 31, 2014 (650,000 − 590,000) less tax. The net income for
2015 is calculated as follows:

EXERCISE 22–1
a. Sterling Inc. is owned by a close family member of a director of Kessel Ltd. This
makes Kessel Ltd. and Sterling Inc. related parties. Disclosure is required for the
relationship, any transactions during the period, and the fact that the amount was
written off during the year.
b. Kessel Ltd.’s 35% share ownership of Saunders Ltd. would normally be presumed
to give it significant influence, thus making the parties related. As such, the nature
of the relationship and the transaction itself need to be disclosed. There is, however,
no requirement to state that the transaction was at arm’s length unless this fact can
be verified.
c. Mr. Chiang is a member of the key management personnel of Kessel Ltd., making
them related parties. Therefore, the details of the transaction need to be disclosed
along with the nature of the relationship. As well, the guarantee of the mortgage
should also be disclosed.
d. Even where there is economic dependence, regular supplier-customer relationships
do not indicate related party relationships. Thus, no separate disclosure of this
transaction is required.

EXERCISE 22–2
a. Without any further information about cross shareholdings, the presence of a single
common director between companies does not, in and of itself, indicate a related
party relationship.

b. A single investor has influence, but not control, over the other two companies. This
would not normally indicate a related party relationship between the two associate
companies.
c. Each of the directors is individually related to each of the companies. The presence
of common directors does not, in and of itself, indicate a related party relationship
between the two companies. However, IAS 24 does require an examination of the
substance, and not just the form, of the relationships. If the five directors have
demonstrated a pattern of acting together as a single voting unit, then it can be
argued that as a group, they control the two companies. In this case, the presence
of a common controlling group would indicate that the companies are related.

EXERCISE 22–3

a. January 8, 2018: The appropriation was approved after the year-end and there is no
indication that this action was substantively enacted prior to the approval date. As
such, this was not a condition present at year-end, and no adjustment is required.
However, disclosure should be made, as this event will likely have a material effect
on future operations.
b. January 27, 2018: Although the bonus was approved after year-end, it clearly relates
to the financial results of the year and was committed under employment contracts
that existed at the year-end. The bonus should thus be accrued on December 31.
c. February 3, 2018: The additional taxes should be accrued, as the tax dispute
already existed at the year-end. The change will be treated prospectively, (i.e.,
adjust in 2017 only) unless it can be demonstrated that the previous provision was
made in error.
d. February 21, 2018: This should be adjusted, as the error caused by the fraud existed
at the reporting date. As well, because there is an illegal act involved, there may be
further disclosures required.
e. March 16, 2018: Dividends should not be adjusted, as there is no obligation to
pay them until they are declared. However, disclosure of the declaration should be
made.
f. March 18, 2018: The condition did not exist at the reporting date, so no adjustment
is required. If the loss of the machine will have a material effect on future operations,
then disclosure should be made.

EXERCISE 22–4
Although the damage only appeared after the reporting period, the engineers have indicated that the problem may have been present for several years. This would indicate
the presence of an adjusting event. However, a provision should not be made as there is
no legal obligation to make the repairs at year-end, that is, the building could simply be
abandoned rather than repaired. What should be done, however, is an impairment review
under IAS 36, and any impairment of the asset should be recorded.

EXERCISE 22–5
The auditor needs to consider if there is sufficient evidence available to support a clean
opinion, that is, that the financial statements have not been materially misstated. The correspondence with the legal counsel should be examined carefully in order to determine if
the assertion that the outcome cannot be determined is supportable. Contingent liabilities
are not accrued as provisions if there is only a possible, but not present, obligation that will
only be settled by an uncertain future event, or if a present obligation cannot be reliably
measured. If accrual of the provision is not warranted, disclosure in the notes is still
required. In this case, the effects appear material, so the auditor will need to make sure
that the appropriate note disclosures are made.
The auditor will also need to assess management’s assertion that the plant will be closed
if the legal case is lost as this may have a pervasive effect on future operations. The
auditor may need to question the going concern assumption. Although it may be too
early to make this determination, the compromise of the going concern assumption would
lead to presentation of the financial statements using a different basis of accounting. If
management refused to make this change, then the auditor would need to consider if a
qualified, or adverse, opinion was warranted.
Even if the auditor is satisfied with the disclosures made, the pervasiveness of the matter
may suggest the need for an emphasis of matter paragraph to be included in the audit
report, thus drawing attention to the disclosures.

Solutions To Exercises

The total profits of $52,000 are greater than the total losses of $14,000, therefore ($52,000×
10%) = $5,200
In absolute terms, ignoring the + and – signs, business lines 1, 2, and 4 meet this
threshold.
Assets test:
($478,000 × 10%) = $47,800. Business lines 1 and 4 meet this threshold.
Conclusion:
Based on the tests above, business lines 1, 2, and 4 all meet at least one of the three
tests above.
For the 75% or greater test ($289,000 × 75%) = $216,750
Sum of business lines 1, 2, and 4 (90,000 + 25,000 + 140,000) = $255,000
This test has been met by all of the reportable segments, which are business lines 1,
2, and 4. However, management can override these tests and report a business line
as a reportable segment if they consider the segmented information to be useful to the
stakeholders.

EXERCISE 22–7
Interim reporting has several challenges:

• Changes in accounting principles: If this change were to occur in the second or third
quarter, how should this affect the first quarter interim financial statements? The
general consensus is that, even if the change of a particular accounting policy, such
as a depreciation method, is prospective, the annual change should be prorated to
each of the interim accounting periods so as not to over/under state any specific
quarter. This would lessen any tendency of management to manipulate accounting
policies within a specific quarter to influence bonuses or operational results targets.
Thus, even though the change in policy is applied prospectively for the fiscal year, if
interim statements are prepared, the change in policy would be applied retroactively,
but proportionally, between each quarterly period to smooth the results over each
quarter for that fiscal year.
• Cyclical and seasonal swings experienced by businesses within a fiscal year: Revenue can be concentrated over a limited number of months, while expenses may be

Chapter 22 Solutions

567

incurred monthly. If IFRS guidelines are followed, the principles of revenue recognition and matching (of expenses incurred to earn those revenues) will continue to be
accrued and recorded within each of the interim periods and the same tests used
for annual financial statements would be applied to the interim reports.
• Allocations for income taxes and earnings per share: The treatment requires each
interim period to be independent of each other and for interim allocations to be
determined by applying all the same tests as those used for the annual reports.
• Auditors: While some stakeholders continue to push for an examination of the
interim reports in order to provide assurance, auditors are reluctant to express an
opinion on interim financial statements. As such, there will always be a trade-off
between the need for assurance through an audit opinion and the need to produce
the interim report on a timely basis.

ASPE does not contain any guidance for reporting interim reporting or segmented information. The issues would be the same for companies following either IFRS or ASPE,
except that IFRS requires more disclosures.

The company’s income before taxes declines in 2016 due to higher cost of goods
sold (COGS) as a percentage of net sales, as compared with 2015. Moreover, the
COGS in 2015 decreased by 3% from the previous year followed by a more than
offsetting increase back to greater than the 2014 percentage levels. Was there a
write-off of inventory in 2016 that would cause COGS to sharply increase from the
previous year? More investigation would be needed to determine the reason for
the difference. Selling and administration continues to slowly decrease over the
three-year period as a percentage of sales, suggesting that management may be
taking steps to make operations more efficient. Separating the selling from the
administration expenses would be a worthwhile drill-down into the numbers.
Horizontal (trend) analysis is as follows:

This trend-line analysis highlights the jump in COGS between 2015 and 2016. Note
how sales increased by 19% from 2014 while COGS increased by 23%. This divergent trend between these two accounts should be investigated further. Even though
selling and administration expenses were shown to be dropping as a percentage of
sales, these expenses actually increased over the two years. Further investigation
of the increasing selling and administration costs might be necessary.
As can be seen from analysis of the two schedules above, different areas of operations may become targeted for further investigation depending on which schedule
is examined. An area may not look particularly troublesome until another type of
analyses is considered.
b. Limitations of these types of analyses include:
• Vertical/Common Size Analysis: The downside to this type of analysis is the
need to avoid management bias, or the temptation to use various accounting
policies to favourably change a gross margin for personal reasons such as
bonuses or positive performance evaluations. For example, if a gross margin
decreased from 40% to 35% over a two-year period, the decline could be
a realistic reflection of operations, or it could be the result of a change in
estimates or of accounting policy. For this reason, any change in the ratios
should always be further investigated.
• Horizontal/Trend Analysis: If the company’s operations are relatively stable
each year, this analysis can be useful. However, changes in these ratios could
also be due to a change in pricing policy and not due to actual transactions
and economic events. Again, more investigation is necessary to determine
if the increase is due to true economic events or changes in policy made by
management.
It is important to remember that ratios are only as good as the data presented in the
financial statements. For example, if quality of earnings is high, then ratio analysis
can be useful, otherwise it may do more harm than good. Also, it is important to
focus on a few key ratios for each category to avoid the risk of information overload;
it is those few key ratios that should be investigated and tracked over time. It is
also important to understand that industry benchmarks make no assurances about
how a company compares to its competitors since the basis for the industry ratio
may be different than the basis used for the company. As such, ratios provide good
indicators for further investigation, but they are not the end-point of an evaluation.

EXERCISE 22–9

a. Liquidity Ratio: Measures the enterprise’s short-term ability to pay its maturing
obligation:
Current ratio: 499,500 ÷ 393,200 = 1.27
If a guideline of 2:1 is the norm for this industry, then this company’s ratio is low. This
company can meet its current debts provided that accounts receivable are collectible
and inventory sellable. Too low could be an issue while too high could also be an
issue and indicate an inefficient use of funds.
Quick ratio: 499,500 − 210,500 − 15,900 ÷ 393,200 = 0.69
If a guideline of 1:1 is the norm for this industry, this company’s ratio is low. More
information is needed, such as historical trends or industry standards. Nearly 50%
of the current assets are made up of inventory. Therefore, inventory risks such as
obsolescence, theft, or competitors’ products could affect this company.
b. Activity Ratio: Measures how effectively the enterprise is using its assets. Activity
ratios also measure the liquidity of certain assets such as inventory and receivables
(i.e., how fast the asset’s value is realized by the company).
Receivables turnover: 550,000 ÷ 213,100 = 2.58 times per year or every 365 ÷
2.58 = 141 days
If a guideline of 30 to 60 days is the norm for this industry, receivables are being
collected too slowly and too much cash is being tied up in receivables. Comparison
to industry standards or historical trends would be useful.
Inventory Turnover: 385,000 ÷210,500 = 1.83 times per year or every 365 ÷1.83 =
199 days
An inventory turnover of less than three times per year appears to be very low. Too
low may mean that too much cash is being tied up in inventory or there is too much
obsolete inventory that cannot be sold. Too high can signal that inventory shortages
may be resulting in lost sales. More information about the industry is needed.
Asset Turnover: 550,000 ÷ 1,369,500 = 0.40
This ratio appears low. Too low means that this company uses its assets less
efficiently to generate sales. Industry standards and historical trends would be
useful.

ii. The company’s accounts receivable turnover is unfavourable relative to the

(60 + 80 + 240) ÷ 180 = 2.11 (10 + 70 + 50) ÷ 75 = 1.73
Acid-test ratio (60 + 80) ÷ 180 = 0.78
(10 + 70) ÷ 75 = 1.07

Yeo Company’s current ratio improved significantly from 1.73 in 2014 to 2.11 in 2015.
This means that in 2015, Yeo Company had $2.11 of current assets available to pay each
$1.00 of short-term debt. However, the acid-test is a more rigorous measure of short-term
debt-paying ability because it excludes less liquid current assets such as Yeo Company’s
merchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is excluded because it is not available
to pay short-term debt until it has been sold; there is also the risk that it might not be
sold, due to obsolescence, spoilage, or poor sales. The acid-test for 2014 showed that
there was $1.07 of quick current assets, or liquid current assets, available to pay each
$1.00 of short-term obligations. The acid-test decreased in 2015 indicating that there was
$0.78 of quick current assets available to pay each $1.00 of current liabilities, highlighting
a potential cash flow problem. When there are insufficient current assets available to
pay current liabilities, liquidity, or cash flow, is a concern, hence the relationship between
short-term debt-paying ability and cash flow.

EXERCISE 22–14
Kevnar Corporation has strengthened its balance sheet because its debt ratio decreased
from 2014 to 2015. Strengthening the balance sheet refers to how assets are financed—
through debt or equity. The greater the equity financing, the stronger the balance sheet.
This is because there is risk associated with debt financing (i.e., the risk of being unable
to meet interest and/or principal payments). Therefore, although Kevnar Corporation
has a greater percentage of its assets financed through debt than does Dilly Inc., it has
increased equity financing which indicates a strengthening of the balance sheet because
of the decrease in risk associated with debt financing.

574

Solutions To Exercises

Financing through equity also has its disadvantages. Having more equity-based financing
can mean a dilution of ownership that results from the issuance of more shares to outside
investors. Having more shareholders also means that there will be additional claims to
the equity in the business. Conversely, debt does not dilute the ownership of a business
since a creditor is only entitled to the repayment of the agreed-upon principal plus interest,
so there is no direct claim on future profits of the business. Moreover, if the company is
successful, the existing owners will reap a larger portion of the rewards than they would
have if they had issued more shares to outside investors in order to finance the growth.
Additionally, interest on debt can reduce net income and, hence, reduce income taxes,
making equity financing potentially a more costly source of financing than debt. Because
of the requirement to comply with federal laws and securities legislation, financing through
issuance of shares is usually a more complicated and lengthy process than acquiring
funds from debt sources. This certainly slows the financing process down, but it can also
add to the costs of equity based financing.
