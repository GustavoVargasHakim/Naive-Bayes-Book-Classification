»Preface
When I was growing up, as the oldest of 12 children, my parents did a lot of
business with the “co-op.” In this case, the co-op was Farmers Union Cooperative Oil Association of South St. Paul, which later became River Country Cooperative and remains a thriving business in east central Minnesota.
It was the only business where my parents had credit. My parents had actually purchased common stock in the co-op in the late 1960s, which, as I
discovered later, is unusual since most members are allowed to earn their
way into a farm supply cooperative without having to formally purchase
common stock. Our family had no credit cards and no home equity line of
credit in the 1960s and 1970s. The fact that we lived from one paycheck to
another meant that having credit at the co-op was a blessing, provided the
account was paid off promptly every month, which it was. The co-op was
where we purchased gas and where the car got fixed. Tires, batteries, oil
filters, dog food, and other goods were bought at the co-op. And every year
my family received a patronage refund. The co-op had operations in three
counties and the nearest location was almost 15 miles away.
We banked with a credit union and insurance was done with a
mutual insurance company. My cousin, on whose farm we worked, was
a member of three farm supply cooperatives and his insurance was in a
township mutual insurance company. Childhood photos would invariably have someone in my family wearing a red Cenex (now part of CHS,
Inc.) or green Land O’Lakes ball cap. Both were cooperatives. I worked
at the co-op for four years; my brother later worked there, and ultimately
became General Manager at a farm supply cooperative in WashingAN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

ton state. My Aunt Maureen (known as Peg) was an executive secretary
at what was then the St. Paul Bank for Cooperatives, and would relate
her experiences there over a 30-odd year career. As children, we did not
understand what a cooperative or mutual was. We knew that gas might
be less expensive just down the road and did not require a 15-mile drive to
get there! But it was just the way things were done at our house.
As I attended graduate school at the University of Minnesota and then
Purdue University, and began a career in academia at Kansas State University and now back at the University of Minnesota, I began to work
within a network that involved frequent engagement with cooperative
directors, managers, employees, and other stakeholders, including academics, accountants, attorneys, lenders, and state cooperative council
leaders. I began to better understand the network of agricultural and consumer cooperatives and mutual insurance firms in our economy. None of
my undergraduate classes in the business school discussed cooperatives.
In fact, for one of my classes in which I was required to discuss a company’s annual report, I chose to discuss a firm that happened to be a cooperative. My professor intoned in a professorial voice that “Cooperatives
were a socialistic idea” and promptly gave me a C. Historically, colleges
of agriculture, rather than colleges of business, were home to collegiate
courses on cooperatives.
Cooperatives and mutuals are just a different form of business. Once
you start looking closely, you begin to appreciate the extent to which they
exist throughout the world. Like any business, they exist to make a profit
and make their members—who are customers—better off by providing a
product or service. The differences lie in how income is distributed, how
they are financed, and how they are owned by members. All of these concepts are discussed in this book.
For a number of years, I have been asked to write a textbook on cooperatives and mutuals. I have chosen to write an introductory textbook.
Over the past ten years, we have seen many retirements of faculty who
taught courses on cooperatives and provided many educational programs
to directors and employees. The popularity of such courses has resulted
in new faculty being hired who do not have the deep institutional knowledge that other instructors had developed over a long career. There are
also new courses being taught in colleges and universities where there
was no such course taught previously. Thus, I have chosen to write something for students who are taking their first course in cooperatives. An
extensive set of teaching materials with detailed lessons plans, case studies, and information, accompanies this textbook; these materials should
be useful for instructors and students.

PREFACE
I owe a great deal of gratitude to my parents for exposing my siblings
and I to the cooperative and mutual form of business. My colleagues in
the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA NCERA 210 Multi-State Coordinating Committee of Land Grant University Faculty Focused on Research
on Cooperatives have been a valuable sounding board for me. In particular, Phil Kenkel and Greg McKee have been great sounding boards for this
textbook. I owe a lot of thanks to my long-time friend and colleague from
Kansas State, David Barton, who was involved in the last textbook written
on cooperatives in 1989 and kept a set of materials available for others to
use over the years. And I owe much to my co-instructors who help teach
the law school class on cooperatives and mutuals at the University of Minnesota. Chris Kopka, Tom Pierson, and Dave Swanson have deepened my
knowledge of mutuals and cooperatives.
Most importantly, I am deeply indebted to the thousands of directors, managers, employees, and stakeholders of cooperatives and mutuals who have educated me about their businesses over the past 25 years.
This education has occurred through programs offered by state cooperative councils, cooperative annual meetings, regional workshops such as
the Farmer Cooperatives conference and California Center for Cooperative Development education program, and the activities of the National
Council on Farmer Cooperatives. I have had the opportunity to lecture
or work in more than 100 countries, with much of this work related to
cooperatives or mutuals. The issues are the same no matter where one
goes! The relationships among all of these individuals have helped make
my career very rewarding. My job involves a great deal of public-private
partnerships with these individuals and I am very blessed with this network. I also want to thank to Jerry Ryan and the employees and producers
of Arrabawn Co-op in Nenagh, Ireland, who provided my students and I
an up-close look at Irish cooperatives as part of their study tour. I have
led more than a dozen student agricultural study tours in Latin America,
Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa, and cooperatives were an
important stop for my students.
Cooperative leaders had the foresight to create various endowments
at a number of universities to ensure that faculty teach courses in cooperatives and create new knowledge about cooperatives. In that spirit, the
CHS Foundation and CoBank have graciously helped provide funding in
the development and editing of this book and its materials. I could not
have done this without their help. Finally, I would remiss if I did not thank
Kansas State University and University of Minnesota for allowing me to
teach, research, and conduct extension and outreach programs on cooperatives as part of my career. It has been a great career choice for me.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

»Introduction
The purpose of this textbook is to introduce the ideas of cooperation and
mutualism. Consequently, it is likely to be used in an introductory course
on cooperatives and mutuals as opposed to a graduate seminar course. As
an economist, it stands to reason that much of my discussion is written
through the eyes of economics. After all, a cooperative or mutual will not
survive unless it achieves an economic purpose. Another goal I have with
the book is to make it accessible, affordable, and easy to update.
I began with roughly 320 pages of double-spaced text. As I tried to separate what should be in the teaching manual relative to the text, it gradually dawned on me that, with the many kinds of materials publicly available, I was making the book too unwieldy. No class is the same; some are
taught once a week, some twice, some three times. The number of students differs, as does the classroom itself, with some courses taught in
traditional lecture halls and others in active student learning classrooms.
The real value to the instructor and reader is the teaching materials and
how they are used. Virtually all instructors supplement a textbook with
their own materials and the same will be true with this book as well.
I thus looked at the materials and decided to make the book much
smaller and more focused. Student feedback was overwhelmingly positive! This process resulted in moving much of the original material into
the teaching manual and creating a shorter textbook. A number of my
colleagues have contributed to the lesson plans in the teaching manual
and I want to acknowledge their help and contributions.
The last cooperative textbook, which was edited by David Cobia in
1989 and includes chapters written by various cooperative scholars, made
an outstanding contribution by creating a consistent set of cooperative
terminology. I have tried to follow their practice, with the exception of
one term: investor-oriented firm, or IOF, is a term I understand as an academic, but I believe it is confusing for readers in an introductory class.

I have thus chosen to use the terms cooperatives and non-cooperative
corporations. Finally, mutuals have never been discussed within previous
textbooks on cooperatives and there is no widespread literature on them.
Because there is so much overlap, and because many people who belong
to a cooperative also belong to a mutual insurance firm and likely do not
even realize it, I have chosen to add mutualism as an idea in this textbook.
In keeping with the idea of making the book easily readable, I have
chosen not to use explicit citations like those used in an academic journal
article. Rather, I have compiled endnotes with information on the sources
for particular concepts or ideas. I have tried to acknowledge original
sources wherever possible, and to recognize individuals who helped popularize those concepts and ideas.
The first chapter introduces the idea of a firm and how it is defined and
organized. I then introduce the idea of property rights and governance. For
the vast majority of students, this is the first time they will be exposed to
this concept. Because a cooperative is a firm, it is important that students
are grounded in these concepts. The formation of cooperatives and mutuals is introduced within the context of the firm’s Make or Buy decision.
The second chapter defines cooperatives as participatory organizations
in which members participate in economic and social benefits, ownership,
and control. I introduce the importance of a cooperative using a business
strategy to recognize that members are first and foremost customers, and
lay out the various types of cooperatives. I also introduce some of the reasons why cooperatives have been used so widely in agriculture.
The third chapter lays out cooperative accounting and finance concepts. Students taking a course in cooperatives may have little or no background in accounting, but such knowledge is needed to understand the
ways in which members participate in their cooperative.
The fourth chapter introduces several topics unique to cooperatives and
mutuals, including policies, economic development, pricing strategies, and
current issues in cooperatives. Chapter Five ties these concepts together.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

»Chapter One

Cooperatives and Mutuals are Firms

The purpose of a firm is to decide what to produce, how to produce it, and
how to distribute what is produced. Legal forms of organizations include
for-profit corporations, non-profit organizations, partnerships, and sole
proprietorships. The majority of business organizations in the U.S. are
corporations, and are referred to as C corporations because such organizations tax the corporation differently from the owners of the corporation.
A number of these corporations are publicly traded, which means they
issue stock that can be bought and sold by buyers and sellers in an organized stock exchange. Stock owners include institutional investors such
as mutual funds, pension (private and public) funds, and life insurance
companies. Cooperatives are a special case of corporations.
This chapter describes how a firm is organized. Market economies such
as those found in the U.S. and in many other parts of the world operate
efficiently when firms are organized in the ways discussed in this chapter.
The next chapter describes the organizational characteristics of a cooperative, while the third chapter describes the accounting and financial
characteristics of a cooperative or mutual, with the economic transaction
clearly showing why a cooperative is different from other forms of business. It is important for the reader to understand what a firm is in order to
fully understand the concepts underpinning cooperation and mutualism.

The success of a firm lies in its ability to have clear property rights

A property right is a legally enforced right to select the uses of an economic
good produced by a firm. Private property rights are those assigned to an
individual person, while an alienable property right is one that can be given
or transferred to someone else. For example, the government employs
a police force and legal system to enforce these rights. Ownership of the
property right includes the use of that right and its alienability or ability to
AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
give or transfer that right. These rights are separated such that, for example,
a person can rent an apartment but cannot sell the apartment.
Market economies have the ability to be highly efficient in organizing
economic activity if the property rights are clearly known and assignable
to individuals, and if the contracting costs such as search and information
costs, bargaining and decision costs, and drafting, policing, and enforcement costs are known. Specific knowledge is important in decision-making,
and individuals make more productive decisions when property rights are
known and assignable. Firms exist because there are contracting costs to
using markets, and these costs may be lower when done by firms.
This is easy to understand in a business such as a proprietorship, where
one person makes all decisions and signs all contracts. But it is more complex in a firm such as a cooperative or mutual. A considerable amount of
research suggests that firms are actually a connection of a group of contracts. The firm signs contracts with 1) suppliers to purchase inputs to
create something, 2) employees to help provide services with their labor,
3) lenders, bondholders, preferred stockholders, or others who provide
capital to the firm, 4) buyers who agree to purchase the products or services made by the firms, or 5) any other entity doing some form of business with the firm.
In a cooperative, however, some of these contracts exist with owners
and employees of the firm. In a consumer cooperative, the goods and services provided by the cooperative are consumed by the members, while
in a producer cooperative the cooperative markets products supplied by
the members. Cooperatives are successful if they are able to make something for their members either through purchasing supplies or providing
inputs rather than having members do this in the market as individuals
with no ownership. This Make or Buy decision has been widely studied
within the context of the contractual arrangements that make up a firm.
The concepts of ownership, property rights, and purpose of a firm are key
to understanding the unique nature of a cooperative.

Who owns a firm?

An owner of a firm is someone who has the right to control the firm
and the right to any residual earnings after the firm has contracted its
expenses with its suppliers, employees, lenders, and others with whom
it has a contractual arrangement. These two rights—control and residual
claimant on earnings—are linked together or are obtained jointly in a
corporation and are the fundamental basis of ownership. There are costs,
however, associated with these two rights. For example, one key cost with
regard to the right to residual earnings is the issue of risk and the firm’s

CHAPTER ONE: COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALS ARE FIRMS
strategy choice. More business units in a firm has may lead to greater
diversification, which can reduce risk as long as the correlation between
earnings in each of the business units is negative or close to zero.
For the right to control the firm, there are costs of controlling managers and costs of collective decision-making. Monitoring the actions of
management is difficult when there are many owners, as is often the case
with cooperatives and mutuals. Owners can ensure that outside audits are
conducted and internal controls are in place. In addition, they attempt to
ensure that the board of directors is composed of individuals with the best
knowledge possible to monitor management. As seen in the next chapter,
cooperatives are limited in this regard because their directors must come
from members. The costs of collective decision-making may be high if
owners have differing opinions arising from different needs with regard to
the cooperative’s products and services. The greater these differences, the
greater the costs of collective decision-making.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

Corporate governance

Knowing the governance of a firm is important in understanding how it
functions. In an organization such as a C corporation, decision rights are
allocated between those internal to the firm such as shareholders, boards
of directors, senior managers, and those external to the firm such as outside auditors, regulatory agencies, analysts, and other stakeholders. Organizations are designed to create jobs that address certain tasks which must
be accomplished, and these jobs include varying levels of authority to
decide how to best complete those tasks.
Think about this concept in regard to a convenience store that sells
refined fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel, a limited selection of grocery
products, convenience foods, and similar products. This store has two
cash registers. Consider point A, where there are few tasks to accomplish
and limited authority to make decisions. This job might be a clerk who
is contracted to run the cash register and has limited authority to make
decisions. Point B has more tasks to perform but limited decision-making
authority. An example might be a shift leader who runs the cash register,
is the supervisor for the other clerk, and may do certain jobs within the
store such as stock shelves, but who has limited authority to make other

decisions. Point C involves more tasks and more authority. This would
be the store manager who has supervisory responsibilities for all employees in the store and is responsible for inventory control. Point D involves
many tasks and more authority to make decisions. The store owner or
franchise owner who owns this store and perhaps other stores has the
responsibility to make decisions regarding pricing, but is subject to the
franchise contract with regard to brand selection, services being offered,
and choice of suppliers.
Organizations are complex as they grow in size. Managers with more
and more responsibility thus find that the tradeoff between the authority to make decisions (decision rights) and the required tasks is complex,
because now the manager is responsible for many employees who are
themselves assigned tasks and decision rights. Achieving the right alignment between tasks and decision rights is difficult in larger organizations.
The authority to make decisions can be broken down into a series of
steps. An organization 1) seeks proposals to use resources such as capital,
labor, and structure contracts to assign the resources to the appropriate
user, 2) makes a decision to choose the appropriate proposal, 3) implements the decision, and 4) monitors the performance of the implemented
decision, and rewards accordingly. Steps 1 and 2 are often called decision
management while steps 3 and 4 are called decision control.
The design of a corporation’s governance is crucial, and it is good practice to separate decision management from decision control. Otherwise,
those making the decisions may choose what is best for themselves rather
than for the organization. Many organizations have a board of directors that is responsible for monitoring the performance of the individual
managing the firm, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The board
has decision control, while the CEO has decision management. This separation of decision management from decision control leads to a hierarchical structure, as managers have decision management responsibilities
in their job and decision control responsibilities over others below them
who themselves have decision management responsibilities.
Organizations are evaluated on their governance system through
three different methods: 1) the motivation of value-maximizing decisions,
2) protection of assets from unauthorized use, and 3) financial statements
that comply with legal requirements. Because much of the ownership of
publicly-traded corporations is by institutional investors who own a small
amount of stock in the firm, there is separation of ownership and control.
This is in contrast to a small business, where the manager owns and controls the business and has direct incentives to be very efficient with the use
of assets.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
There are many benefits to organizing a firm as a corporation. Access
to equity capital can occur through sales of stock to investors. The cost
of equity is less because these investors own diversified portfolios, so the
premium paid to them for the risk associated with uncertainty in the corporation’s cash flows is less. The corporation serves as the center of many
contracts and is always one party to these contracts signed with buyers,
suppliers, employees, lenders, and other entities. These contracts specify
the decision rights to each party. The corporate charter, which includes the
articles of incorporation and bylaws, specifies the rights of shareholders.
The top-level authority in a corporation is divided between shareholders, the board of directors, and senior management. The decision authority
of shareholders includes the right to elect directors to a board, ratify the
choice of an independent auditor, and be involved in other issues specified
in the charter or bylaws including mergers, issuance of additional shares
of stock, or changes in legal structure. Before an annual meeting, shareholders are sent information from the corporation that describes various
proposals that require their vote, such as elections of directors to the board.
Management, subject to board approval, makes recommendations to the
shareholders regarding these issues. Shareholders are the residual claimants to the corporation in the event of dissolution. Thus, their voting control is often linked proportionally to their ownership interest.
The primary legal authority for managing a corporation lies with its
board, although it may delegate much of this to professional managers
hired for that purpose. The board has top-level decision control to oversee
the corporation and ratify important decisions. These decisions include
recruiting, interviewing, hiring, evaluating, and compensating the CEO.
Large capital expenditures require board approval. Boards have legal
indemnification from lawsuits provided it can be shown that they were

EXHIBIT 1.2 What are articles of incorporation?
The articles of incorporation lay out the basic framework of the firm and are broader than
its bylaws. In the case of a cooperative, the articles of incorporation describe the type of
organization (non-stock cooperative, stock cooperative, cooperative association, etc.),
purpose of the business, number of shares of common stock and any preferred stock that
might be issued, number of directors and how a member votes on those directors, legal
definition of membership, location of the headquarters (the legal address for the cooperative), and asset disposal upon liquidation. These articles are filed within the state where
the cooperative is incorporated and any amendments to them must be voted on by the
membership and refiled with the state. This can be tedious and expensive in time and
treasure. Thus the most basic information is presented in the articles.

CHAPTER ONE: COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALS ARE FIRMS
acting prudently. Corporate boards generally have 9–12 directors, and
usually include several members of senior management. A committee
structure is used to handle nominating, compensation, audit, and other
issues that are under the purview of the board. The CEO is the senior most
individual in the corporation. The job of the CEO is to focus on the broad
issues affecting the firm and develop, implement, and monitor its strategy.
The CEO delegates decision rights among senior level managers.

Cooperatives are an example of a closely-held firm

Thus far, the discussion has focused on investor-benefit firms whose stock
is traded on exchanges. However, there are other forms of corporations
whose stock is not publicly-traded. Family-owned firms account for a large
number of corporations in the food economy. There are non-family owned

EXHIBIT 1.3 What are bylaws?
Bylaws are the rules or policies that explain how any organization, including a cooperative,
operates. For example, the bylaws of a cooperative define the purpose of the cooperative and its geographical location. The bylaws define who a member is and what rights
are associated with membership. Bylaws specify a member’s responsibilities with the
cooperative and what the role membership plays in setting the policies. The governance
of a cooperative lies within the responsibilities of membership in voting on a board of
directors and the committee structure used by the board and officers. Bylaws also address
disputes that might occur, how a membership may be terminated, how an organization
can change its rules and policies, how a meeting of the membership is to be held, and
what can occur at that meeting. In general, the bylaws and articles reflect cooperative
principles, and the legal statutes in each state reflect these principles. The nature of the
business relationship between the members and the cooperative are typically contained
in the bylaws, which is not the case for non-cooperative corporations. Bylaws contain
information that is most likely to be updated periodically.

EXHIBIT 1.4 What are policies?
A policy is a wise or expedient rule of conduct or management. Policies are created by
boards of directors to help guide the direction of the cooperative. In contrast to articles of incorporation or bylaws whose changes are voted on by the members, policies
are voted on by just the board of directors, chosen by the membership. Policies must
change with conditions to allow and encourage organizations such as cooperatives and
mutuals to effectively fulfill their essential purposes. Policies should reinforce or at least
be compatible with the cooperative definition and principles. Policies often reside in
standard operating procedure documents, such as board of director policy manuals, or
reflect decisions made by boards and contained in the minutes.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
firms that are also privately held but whose shareholders are venture capital
funds or similar entities whose members include management. In addition,
there are many families who control the governance of a company through
different classes of common stock with differing control rights.
In a broad sense, firms can be thought of in three ways. A non-profit
firm is organized to benefit the public. Its governance is volunteer-based
with no ownership by anyone since it rarely has any assets. It is not taxed
on its income, since non-profits are not designed to maximize profits. In
a mutual-benefit firm—the subject of this book—income distribution
is tied to members’ participation through use of the cooperative. Owners generally have one vote per member on governance issues, and the
income from these types of organizations is either taxed once at the cooperative or mutual level or the income distributed to its members is taxed.
Investor benefit firms link income distribution and governance with the
proportion of ownership investment, are taxed on their income, and owners are taxed again on any dividend income.

Summary

Cooperatives are firms with the same structure and property rights as corporations or other types of firms. It is necessary to understand why firms
exist to understand why cooperatives exist and why they are a special case
of a corporation. Because the organizational structure of a cooperative is
different with regards to the two property rights of control and residual
claimant on earnings, it is important to understand these concepts. The

survival of the cooperative depends upon its ability to achieve an economic purpose. Thus, it is crucial to understand how ownership and management of the firm are important aspects of corporate governance. The
next chapter discusses why cooperatives have a formal governance structure just like other organizations, and describe the origins of that structure.

Cooperatives and mutuals are

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines cooperatives as “user-owned
and controlled business from which benefits are derived and distributed equitably on the basis of use.” This definition implies that cooperatives are owned by users who are customers. These users are also members, in general, and because they derive the benefits of membership, they
are also called patrons because the economic benefits derived from the
business done by them as a customer of the cooperative—referred to as
patronage—are distributed proportionately based on that patronage. This
gets complicated! Being a customer implies that you are also a patron
(participate in economic benefits), owner (participate with equity investment), and member (participate in setting policies and governance).
The overall purpose of a cooperative, which is often embedded in its
mission statement, is to meet the needs of the customer using the cooperative. Patronage, ownership, and control are
means to the end. The International Coop- Many cooperative bylaws say that a

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

EXHIBIT 2.1 The mutual company
While many cooperatives are formed from a desire to improve a market failure
situation, improve bargaining power, or create community-ownership, the formation
of a mutual company has its roots in a desire to prevent something bad from happening. In many cases, these companies provide property and casualty insurance and
life insurance.
Mutualism has its roots in meeting a common need for a resource, such as life insurance or property insurance. Early mutual insurance companies were created around the
idea that people living in a common geography who were likely to be friends would all
collectively suffer if one of their homes caught on fire, because the fire would spread
and all would be impacted. A home or business fire could literally wipe out a person’s
wealth. Thus, mutual insurance was a concept whereby all of your neighbors would
contribute insurance premiums to a common pool which would be used in the case of
a fire. The owners were the policyholders. Members desire to keep the costs of insurance premium contributions and fees for management of this pool as low as possible.
Creating a volunteer fire department in which everyone participates is another way of
keeping fees low.
Many of these mutual insurance companies were able to achieve scale in cities
because of population density. In the latter half of the 19th century, when kerosene
lamps were used for light and fireplaces for heat and cooking, fires were a common
problem. In certain areas of the U.S., primarily the Upper Midwest, fire insurance mutual
cooperatives were formed in rural communities, often at the township level. Community-based or township-based insurance recognized that, since there was no safety net,
an individual’s loss from a fire had larger repercussions for the broader community. With
fire insurance, individual consumers have specific needs and, within a group, similar
risk profiles.
As a result, a group of fire insurance companies called “class mutuals” evolved to
address the needs of specific groups of consumers. These organizations— such as a
creamery and cheese factory mutual, or a farmer-based mutual in a township— limited themselves to these groups. This form of organization resulted in expertise in the
specific types of risk, the nature and validity of claims, and risk-prevention techniques,
and they experienced a higher level of group cohesion. This allowed mutuals to flourish;
non-mutual insurance companies had higher insurance premiums because they did
not understand these risks.
Today there is more data to assess these types of risks, and with consolidation many
of these organizations have been incorporated into bigger insurance firms. Life insurance was slightly different. Mutuals flourished because they were able to provide a
product for the entire life of the individual, similar to a savings account, and price it in
a way that an average person could purchase such a policy; non-mutuals, in contrast,
were providing mostly short-term policies. This changed over time. The International
Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation reported more than 200 members from
74 countries in 2015. Examples of well-known mutual insurance firms include Northwestern Mutual (USA), CountryFinancial (USA), State Farm Insurance Company (USA),
and Länsförsäkringar (Sweden).
Globally, the mutual insurance market share was just over 26% in 2015. Many countries
in Western Europe have mutual insurance market shares of over 45%.

CHAPTER TWO: COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALS ARE PARTICIPATORY ORGANIZATIONS

EXHIBIT 2.2 International Cooperative Alliance values and principles of cooperation
The International Cooperative Alliance advocates and promotes the cooperative business
model in almost 100 countries. In 1995, it developed a values and principles statement
for cooperatives. Cooperatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility,
democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity. In the tradition of their founders, cooperative
members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility, and
caring for others. The co-operative principles are guidelines by which cooperatives put
their values into practice.
VOLUNTARY AND OPEN MEMBERSHIP Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open
to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political, or religious discrimination.
DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CONTROL Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making
decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the
membership. In primary co-operatives, members have equal voting rights (one member,
one vote), and co-operatives at other levels are organized in a democratic manner.
MEMBER ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the
common property of the cooperative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if
any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for
any or all of the following purposes: developing their cooperative, possibly by setting up
reserves (part of which at least would be indivisible), benefiting members in proportion
to their transactions with the co-operative, and supporting other activities approved by
the membership.
AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations,
including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that
ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their cooperative autonomy.
EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND INFORMATION Cooperatives provide education and
training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they
can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the
public, particularly young people and opinion leaders, about the nature and benefits
of cooperation.
COOPERATION AMONG COOPERATIVES Cooperatives serve their members most
effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local,
national, regional, and international structures.
CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of
their communities through policies approved by their members.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

EXHIBIT 2.3 The special case of fraternal benefit society
Fraternal benefit societies, a type of mutual insurance company, were founded on
the basis of a “common bond,” a characteristic that members shared —geographic
area, ethnicity, religion, profession, or gender. Among the common bonds of the
fraternals, the strongest were religion, ethnicity, and geography, and these were
the common bonds most understood by members of cooperatives. A fraternal
benefit society is an organization that has the following four characteristics.
First, fraternals must have a lodge system with local chapter organizations that
meet regularly, have elected officers, and bind the members to the organization
through both the financial contributions of the benefit products and time spent
in philanthropic, charitable, or social activities. The lodges also provide “social
outlets for those who [attend] regular meetings of the lodge.” Second, members
of the organization must have a regular opportunity and a defined process to
voice concerns or issues and to elect officers, ensuring that the strategic direction
of the organization is consistent with the wishes of the member-owners. Third,
the organization must pay some form of insurance benefit to its members. That
benefit initially took the form of a lump-sum payment, or “death benefit,” to pay
burial expenses at the time of a member’s death, but it evolved into a more fully
developed life insurance product that was an actuarially based insurance product.
Over time, fraternals started offering health insurance and, in some cases, a portfolio of financial products and services. Fourth, the organization must not operate
on a for-profit basis.
More informally, members of a fraternal are supposed to share a “common bond,”
something that brings members of a group together. Examples of common bonds
include faith (e.g., Lutherans, Catholics), ethnicity (e.g., Croatian Fraternal Union
of America, Association of the Sons of Poland), a particular location (i.e., western
Pennsylvania), women-only associations (i.e., Unity of Bohemian Ladies), professions (e.g., Railwaymen’s Relief Association of America), or any combination of
these categories. The first fraternal dates back to 1868, and the industry experienced explosive growth in the latter half of the 19th century. During this time, fraternals served a variety of purposes, both formal and informal. Formally, they offered
a life insurance product in communities where residents were mostly economically
disadvantaged, and hence provided an early form of social safety net. This safety
net was reinforced by the lodge system, which would frequently take a collection
for a member in need and provide help to organized communities of similar people who looked to help each other. The lodge system created places where recent
immigrants could celebrate their cultural heritages, find out about employment
opportunities, or simply have a place to socialize. As such, lodges contributed to
the development of group identities along the lines of bonding social capital. In
the period around 1900, fraternals provided roughly as much life insurance to
individuals as did commercial providers, with about five million people organized
into approximately 600 fraternal organizations. Thrivent Financial and the Knights
of Columbus are the largest fraternal benefit societies today. Both are faith-based
fraternals, and that bond appears to be the most prevalent in surviving fraternal
benefit societies today.

CHAPTER TWO: COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALS ARE PARTICIPATORY ORGANIZATIONS
united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural
needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.” This definition is wider than the U.S. Department of
Agriculture definition in that it encapsulates social and cultural purposes
for cooperatives. Another way to think about the relationships implied in
this definition is to consider how members participate in the cooperative.
Cooperatives and mutuals are participatory organizations.

Cooperative principles and policies

A principle is described as a governing law of conduct, a general or fundamental truth, or a comprehensive or fundamental law. Many state cooperative incorporation statutes reflect principles. Many laws are based on a
state’s view of appropriate principles. For example, one widely supported
principle is democratic control. In some people’s views and according to
some state laws this means “one member, one vote” with regard to control.
For other people and state laws it means voting by members where voting
power per member may include voting proportional to use of patronage.

EXHIBIT 2.4 Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society
Cooperatives as they are known today trace their roots back to a cooperative formed in
England in 1844. Others had formed prior to this, but were not as influential. The Rochdale
Equitable Pioneers Society was envisioned as a multipurpose consumer cooperative that
sold consumer products to its members. Sugar, flour, oatmeal, butter, and tallow candles
were the first products sold, and market prices were charged to members on a cash basis.
In addition, the society sought to improve the welfare of its members through a mutual
self-help organization that would help improve the lives of its members. This cooperative,
like others formed around that time, limited transactions to those who were members
(and anyone could join regardless of political, religious, or other affiliation), and paid a dividend from the net income (referred to as surplus) generated from the member’s business
(referred to as patronage). This dividend was paid based in proportion to the amount of
patronage business done with that member. Voting on policies that affected members
was done on a democratic (one-member, one-vote) basis. Members were required to contribute to equity capital through an initial investment followed by weekly contributions to
until a minimum threshold was reached. The cooperative started a library to help educate
its members, and women were allowed to join as members. As other cooperatives were
started, they formed a wholesale distribution network to supply these consumer cooperatives and ensure that the food they were purchasing was safe and unadulterated. Food
fraud was a common problem in the mid-19th century before standards and regulations
were passed. All cooperatives today derive their operating principles from these early
principles, which have been modified over time to allow proportional voting and use of
credit for doing business. Their principles have become the foundation for the ICA principles described in Exhibit 2.2.

EXHIBIT 2.5 The cooperative as the competitive yardstick
The cooperative as a competitive yardstick is a well-known analogy for justifying why
cooperatives are often thought of as promoting competition. The main tenets underlying
the cooperative yardstick are:
A. Cooperatives must establish organizations with bottom-up democratic cooperative
philosophy and with an informed and participating membership. This type of structure is difficult to achieve as a business because it involves collective action, but it has
long-run benefits.
B. Cooperatives are an integral segment of existing capitalistic systems, and designed
not to displace other types of businesses but to supplement them as an alternative
form of business.
C. Cooperatives help build the efficiency of total economic systems or value chains
because of their transparency regarding costs.
D. Cooperatives should control a minimum share of the commodity, supply, or service
market segment in order to achieve economies of size and scale.
E. Cooperatives help keep other forms of business competitive by being as
cost-efficient as possible.
F. Cooperatives should preserve individual producer freedom of decision making
because the cooperative is a vertical extension of the farming enterprise.
G. Cooperatives should be organized only if competitive influence is necessary because
the market has failed or because countervailing bargaining power is needed.

EXHIBIT 2.6 What are examples of credit cooperatives?
Credit unions were formed to receive deposits from members, provide lower-fee financial
services such as checking (called share drafts), and provide loans to their members for
homes, vehicles, or other consumer products. Like fraternal benefit societies, credit unions
have a common bond such as geography, employer, religion, or unions membership. The
Farm Credit System was formed to create associations to sell securities and provide operating loans to agricultural producers, and operating and term loans (e.g., land or housing)
to cooperatives owned by farmers or others living in rural areas. The members of these
credit cooperatives are farmer and rural consumers. For the case of associations who lend
to cooperatives, the member may be a cooperative owned by farmers. The National Cooperative Bank lends to cooperatives who are not eligible to borrow from the Farm Credit
System or from rural electric utility banks.

As members, customers who use the cooperative are expected to have
ownership in the cooperative. In economic terms, this means that the
equity of the cooperative is owned by the members. The easiest way to
think about equity investment is direct investment through purchase of
equity shares. As discussed in the next chapter, most members accumulate equity investment through the retention of patronage refunds or per
unit retains in a year, which may be redeemed in the future subject to policies set by the board of directors. This is why customers are often called
equity holders. The equity can only be properly valued upon liquidation,

Participation in control

Customers participate in control by setting policies,
including the governance structure of the cooperative.
These policies are embedded in the bylaws of the organization, which include 1) classes of membership and
their qualifications, 2) the governance system, including
the role and responsibilities of the board of directors and how they are elected, and 3) rules for certain

EXHIBIT 2.7 What is the difference between a stock cooperative
and a nonstock cooperative?
Prior to 1922 when the Capper-Volstead Act was created to formally allow cooperatives
a “right-to-exist,” there were a number of efforts to create legal entities in state statutes
that got around efforts by those who were against the formation of cooperatives. In a
stock cooperative, capital is divided into shares of common stock owned by members,
which is specified in the articles of incorporation. Some stock cooperatives issue preferred
stock and other forms of equity, such as membership certificates, which may or may
not be owned by members. The articles of incorporation do not allow stock transfer to
non-qualifying member-patrons. One share of common stock is often a requirement for
membership with small par value. A nonstock cooperative, called a membership cooperative, uses membership certificates that are given to members upon payment of membership fees. Capital certificates were sometimes created to sell directly to members or issued
as a patronage refund.

hardware stores. They are able to negotiate better prices, purchase much larger volumes of hardware and related products,
and distribute them to their members, who could not obtain
these savings on their own. A number of fast-food restaurant franchise owners have formed purchasing cooperatives,
including United Foodservice Purchasing Cooperative, which is
owned by Yum! Brands franchise operators, and Independent
Purchasing Co-operative, which is owned by Subway franchisees. Independent grocers have formed purchasing cooperatives
such as Associated Wholesale Grocers and Wakefern Foods.

EXHIBIT 2.8 How are directors selected?
The manner in which C corporate directors are chosen is straight-forward. Any natural
person can be selected to the board. The board has created policies whereby directors
are assumed to have some core of knowledge such as accounting or finance, governance,
human resources, or strategy. The board desires a broad diversity of background in core
areas of knowledge plus additional attributes such as diversity including age since many
boards have a policy that directors must retire at age 72, gender, and background. The
use of internal or external board evaluations are used to help the board assess itself. In
addition, two members of management, which include the CEO and another senior leader
often serve on the board. Nominating committees are used to help identify directors with
certain skill sets. Thus, directors are chosen at-large subject to meeting the needs identified by the board. Shareholders in the firm vote for the board based on their proportion of
shares with number of votes linked with their share of equity. Votes are cast for the entire
slate of directors as opposed to each director separately. Director compensation is often
linked with the responsibilities of the directors and size of the firm.
Many cooperatives follow similar practices as those described above. However, cooperatives have one important difference in selecting directors over non-cooperative corporations. Namely, directors are selected from their customers who are members. Some cooperatives use similar tools to identify directors in an effort to identify suitable candidates
for the board. However, because of their unique nature, directors are often chosen based
on geography whereby the cooperative creates districts based on the population of its
members. Thus, nominating committees considers the pool of directors in that geographical district. Board elections in a cooperative ask each member to vote for each director
individually rather than a slate of directors that is presented to the membership. In some
cooperatives with a broader purpose, the board may have informal policies that result in
a director representing a commodity or line of business in the cooperative. A number of
cooperatives with smaller geographic base elect directors at large. Mutuals tend to elect
directors similar to corporations at-large based on qualifications although some regionally-based mutual may use geographic districts.

22

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
cooperatives tend to have a low threshold on membership qualifications.
In many cases, cooperatives use a one member, one vote principle, which
is often called democratic control. Control is typically evidenced by the
ownership of a share of common stock in the case of a stock cooperative,
or by a certificate of membership in the case of membership or non-stock
cooperatives. Cooperatives thus use a voting process to select directors for
the board or make changes in their articles or bylaws; this differs from a
non-cooperative corporation, which is based on investment ownership
(as described in Chapter One).

Principles of cooperation

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines the three principles of cooperation as user-owner, user-control, and user-benefits. Users must own and
finance the cooperative and are responsible for the control of the cooperative, and benefit from their use of the cooperative. Note that these are all
joint decisions, That is, becoming a member of a cooperative to participate
in the benefits also means participation in ownership and control.
Some customers of a cooperative do not participate in these three roles,
but do business with the cooperative as a non-member. The percentage of

EXHIBIT 2.9 Cooperatives and mutuals are not the same as
loyalty programs and buying clubs
Cooperatives and mutuals are not the same as loyalty programs because customers or
users of the loyalty program do not participate in control or ownership. They do receive
economic benefits, but these are not linked with the profitability and, hence, the earnings of the business. Early loyalty programs featured tokens or trading stamps given to
a customer based on a certain volume of sales. These trading stamps were then used to
acquire certain products from the retailer distributing the stamps, and value was linked to
the number of stamps. Firms such as tobacco companies used trading stamps, while consumer packaged goods firms such as General Mills used box tops; other firms began similar programs. By the end of the 20th century, a number of similar programs were in place
including frequent flier programs and points with credit card companies. Rebates also
exist when paying by cash instead of credit card. Other loyalty programs include those at
hotels offering one night free after a certain number of paid nights, or reward programs at
fast food restaurants. The advent of cellular telephones has meant that customized apps
can be used to provide rebates or coupons electronically to members of a loyalty program.
Clubs based on membership with an application fee are used by some retailers such as
Amazon (Prime membership), Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, and CostCo. An annual membership
fee entitles members to shop at the store or use certain services such as free delivery.
Membership in these loyalty programs and clubs is not the same as being a member of a
cooperative because members do not participate in the same way. They receive an economic benefit, but it is not linked with control, ownership, and earnings.

non-member business is quite small in most cooperatives because boards
of directors recognize that these members are free riders in the sense that
they benefit from the cooperative’s presence in the market place but are
not members. Thus, cooperatives tend to use pricing strategies that discourage producers from not being members.

Formation of cooperatives

Firms such as cooperatives are formed through collective action by individuals to solve a common problem. Cooperatives work best when the
solution created by collective action leads to benefits being provided
only to members, and when these benefits are unique. In doing so, the
cooperative is often formed because the costs of the Make or Buy decision
are lowest if the rights of ownership are assigned
to those who use the cooperative as a customer.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
Cooperatives that quickly understand their commonality of purpose
(based on an economic purpose for their members) and position themselves on that purpose are able to create long-lasting value to their members.
Cooperatives are often formed by a desire to improve something. For
example, many farm input supply or marketing cooperatives were formed
by individuals who wanted to see reform in agrarian economy and were
associated with the Populist, Farm Bureau, Farmers Union, Grange, or
Equity movements.
Cooperatives that supply products to consumers, farmers, and businesses are often formed to obtain the economic advantages of purchasing
supplies or providing services in bulk and passing along the volume discounts to their members. In doing so, the members are vertically integrated
“backwards” through the cooperative. For example, farmELECTRIC UTILITY COOPERATIVES

CHAPTER TWO: COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALS ARE PARTICIPATORY ORGANIZATIONS
As discussed earlier, this integration decision is called the “Make-orBuy Decision.” Strictly speaking, members of cooperatives are not vertically integrated through a cooperative because there is no common ownership of the farm or household by the cooperative. Nevertheless, there is
collective ownership of the cooperative and alignment of the cooperative
business model with the consumer or farmer.
Many agricultural marketing cooperatives were formed to help pool
risk from all producers and manage this risk within the cooperative. In
the northern hemisphere, for example, a marketing year generally starts
September 1 or October 1 in one year and is finished 12 months later, on
August 31 or September 30. The crop is harvested in September or October,
and over the course of the year the value of the crop becomes known as
the cooperative discovers its value during the marketing year. Because
many agricultural products are perishable, the price is always lowest at
the beginning of the market year when supplies are greatest and tend to
increase over the marketing year as the supply decreases and more information (e.g., quality) is known about the crop. The cooperative bears the
price and quality risk by purchasing the farmers output at the beginning of
the marketing year, and pays the farmer a competitive price at harvest. The
members finance the capital needed by the cooperative to build storage and
processing assets to add value to the crop throughout the marketing year.
Most farmers cannot manage this price risk on their own and instead
manage it through their membership in a cooperative. In doing so, they
also obtain additional marketing margin, and have increased bargaining
power to countervail the bargaining power held by buyers who could buy
the crop at its lowest price at harvest when supplies are greatest, and to
manage the crop inventory throughout the year to obtain more favorable
prices. As consumers or farmers integrate backwards or forwards, the
cooperative becomes the competitive yardstick in an industry.

Summary

Cooperatives are participatory organizations in that customers participate in ownership, control, and benefits. As such, a cooperative is a closed
marketing channel. Each of these participatory roles carries responsibilities. Membership in a cooperative has implications for benefits and
responsibilities, use of the cooperative, and the transactions undertaken
with it. Thus, cooperatives are uniquely structured to: 1) distribute benefits such as patronage in proportion to use, 2) align their business strategy
on their customers who are selected to the board of directors to control
the cooperative, and 3) make decisions based on the long-term goals of
their members who own the cooperative.

25

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
The cooperative business model exists in many industries around the
world. Cooperatives have unique common bonds that underlie their formation and often have an economic and social purpose. Principles of
cooperation are embedded in state incorporation statutes that underlie the
charter of a cooperative, which includes its articles of incorporation and
bylaws, which are based on historical use. The benefits of participating
with a cooperative and its social purpose are likely the easiest to explain
relative to the benefits of participating in ownership. Thus, constant education is needed with members who are customers. Cooperatives were
formed because there were economic reasons why it was easier to vertically
integrate forward or backwards for all of the cooperative’s members. There
are many reasons why cooperatives form but, in a broad sense, the cooperative is able to obtain volume discounts and pass those discounts back to
members, or to obtain volume premiums and market members’ products
throughout the marketing year to obtain better prices for larger volumes of
similar quality. The concept of a marketing year is crucial in understanding
the operations of agricultural cooperatives.

Income distribution and equity decisions

The first chapter described the features shared by cooperatives and
mutual and non-cooperative corporations, while Chapter Two discussed
features that are unique with regard to how members participate in benefits, control, and ownership. This chapter focuses on participation in
benefits and how cooperatives distribute income, because that is how
most members think about their membership in a cooperative. Cooperatives and mutuals must be competitive like any business and aligned on
customer needs. They must be managed as businesses that can compete
in a capitalistic and highly competitive market economy. Many cooperatives operate simply to allow producers to achieve economies of scale
and increased bargaining power in purchasing inputs and marketing
their commodities. The same can be said about consumer cooperatives
and mutual insurance firms.
Irrespective of its purpose and role, a cooperative should strive to be
as profitable as possible and then distribute those profits to its patrons. A
core principle of the cooperative and mutual business model is service
or operation at cost. This does not imply that the cooperative or mutual
should set prices to eliminate the opportunity for a profit. Instead, a cooperative should implement this principle by being competitive in the market place, making as much profit as possible, and then distributing profits
and residual cash to patron-owners. Profits should be distributed in a way
that maximizes the long-run benefits to members, keeping in mind that
members have heterogeneous interests due to their unique places in their
business and personal life cycles. This distribution of patronage refunds
or per unit retains implements the service at cost principle of cooperatives.
Patron-owners get what is left over through a combination of cash patronage payments (e.g., immediate redemption), cash equity redemption payments, and cash payments of net marketing proceeds. A member’s life cycle

encompasses their use as a customer of the cooperative, which differs as
they age and begin, expand, or contract their business or household.
As mentioned in Chapter Two, cooperatives are participatory organizations. Two of the three ways that members participate include benefits and ownership. The easiest way to understand these concepts is to
observe their impact on the income statement and balance sheet. The
three ways in which members participate in a cooperative comprise an
interrelated set of decisions that influence each member and provide
unique challenges for boards of directors and management to develop a
business strategy that takes into account the impacts on a cooperative’s
balance sheet.

Introduction

Cooperative firms are unique in that they create equity when they pay
patronage refunds in the form of common stock, and they destroy equity
when they redeem previously issued equity for cash. Cooperatives should
actively manage their balance sheet when making decisions on income
distribution and equity redemption. A cooperative must position and
protect the business for short-run and long-run sustainability by adhering
to a balance sheet management philosophy that manages both liquidity
and solvency. Adequate risk capital must be provided by retaining and
managing equity as an element in the overall business strategy. Then the
cooperative should pay out to patron-owners any residual cash as cash
patronage refunds and equity redemptions. As discussed in Chapter One,
owners, as residual claimants, get what is left over in any business.
The evaluation and choice of alternative strategies must be done within
an integrated and comprehensive finance, strategy, and risk management
framework. For cooperatives, this should include both the patron-producer or patron-consumer perspective and the cooperative business perspective. In other words, a cooperative can be viewed as an extension of the
patron’s business, such as a farm or house, or as an independent firm that
attempts to prosper in a market economy. Both perspectives are important.
Most members of agricultural cooperatives are unique in that they
seek to remain farmers in their own geography. That is, a member will
not typically sell their farm and move to a geographic region or country
to begin farming again. With that in mind, a member utilizes a cooperative to receive goods and services at a lower cost than they could by doing
it themselves. Thus, a cooperative should align itself on the needs of its
customers who are its members and owners, and help make them profitable and cost efficient so they can achieve the goal of remaining farmers in

CHAPTER THREE: INCOME DISTRIBUTION EQUITY DECISIONS
that geography. Many remain in multi-generational farming families and
patronize the cooperative over generations.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and the basic structure and rationale of income, cash flow, statement of changes in equity,
and balance sheets look the same for cooperatives as for other business

EXHIBIT 3.1 The case of pooling cooperatives
For many agricultural crops processed as ingredients into other food products or processed
into a consumer product, the value of the crop grown by the producer as a raw material
for these ingredient and consumer products is not known at harvest but becomes known
over the next 12 months as the supply of the crop is processed and before the new harvest
occurs. This 12-month period is known as the marketing year, and in the northern hemisphere typically begins September 1 or October 1 in the current year, which is harvest when
the supply of the crop is greatest, and ends August 31 or September 30 of the next year.
These cooperatives will pay the member an advance payment at harvest corresponding
to some percentage—often enough for the producer to pay the operating loan needed
to plant that crop—of what the cooperative projects the total value of the crop to be
once all the products have been created and sold. This is a delayed pricing situation. The
cooperative commits to purchasing 100 percent of the members’ crop or whatever percentage the producer has committed to the cooperative, as some of these cooperatives
have multi-year written marketing agreements to purchase a certain volume or acreage
of volume from the member. This allows members to pool their risk, provides “a home” for
all of the members’ products, and creates opportunities for greater shared sales revenue and income.
As such, the cooperative may not know what that volume will be because of unique
growing conditions in that year. For example, many marketing cooperatives in California
grow crops such as figs, almonds, peaches, prunes, raisin grapes, oranges, lemons, and
other crops in a localized region. Climatic factors such as lack of rain, too much rain or
frost, or too much heat can cause a decrease in volume. Similarly, certain orchard crops
such as apples and pears, some stone fruits such as apricots and plums, and certain table
olives may exhibit alternate bearing tendencies, with a large volume one year followed
by a small volume the next year. All of these issues affect the value of the crop over the
marketing year. As the value becomes known over the course of the marketing year, the
cooperative provides another payment to producers, generally 4–6 months after harvest,
and a final payment at the end of the year when the total value of the crop is known and
that year’s pool is closed. The cooperative deducts the operating expenses needed to
process the crop.
In this way, the cooperative has essentially little or no net income at the end of its fiscal
year, which is typically on August 31. The board creates equity for asset investments by
deducting or withholding a portion of the value of the crop and assessing each member
a per-unit capital retain based on the members’ volume of business, according to the
process described in the cooperative bylaws.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
entities. However, cooperative principles are embedded in these statements just like in legal statutes. They reflect the nature of transactions
being done with members. It is important to have an understanding of
accounting and finance to fully understand how a member participates in
benefits and ownership. A good way to do this is to understand the impact
of the economic transaction a member does with the cooperative as a customer, and observe its impact on the income statement and balance sheet.

Income statement

The income statement begins with gross receipts which, for a farm supply
or consumer food cooperative or service cooperative, are the sum of all
products or services sold by the cooperative multiplied by their respective prices. In the case of a marketing or pooling cooperative, this is the
sum of all products bought from the members and sold at the competitive
market price. For a processing cooperative, this is the total sales from, for
example, selling corn-ethanol and its co-products or soybean meal and
its co-products. Gross receipts was traditionally used because it denoted
receipt of value of sales done with members. Many cooperatives have
moved to a more traditional language, referring to these as gross revenues
or total sales. Costs of Goods Sold or Costs of Sales are variable costs and
subtracted from these gross receipts.
For a farm supply cooperative these variable expenses include the costs
of buying raw material products such as crop nutrients, seed, and crop
protectants; energy products such as refined
fuels and propane; raw material inputs such

The difference between the gross receipts

Margin or Gross Profit Margin. Virtually

CHAPTER THREE: INCOME DISTRIBUTION EQUITY DECISIONS
all cooperatives develop a pricing strategy based on operating at a fixed
margin per unit because they are “price takers,” so the Gross Margin is
an important measure to understand, and it does not change regardless
of changes in input or output prices, which change the value of total sales.
Operating costs, which are fixed in nature, must be subtracted from this
margin. These costs are typically selling and administrative costs, which
are typically salaried employees(with benefits) whose wages cannot be
attributed directly to the product or technology sold by the cooperative.
These costs also include purchase of new assets such as equipment.
The difference between Gross Margin and Operating Expenses is Operating Income, which includes interest income received by the cooperative,
finance charges from operating loans made to members (Patron Finance
Charges), and any other expenses or revenues received by the cooperative. Cooperatives often do business with other cooperatives and receive
Patronage Refunds as income. The difference between these items and
Operating Income is called Patronage Refunds. Sometimes the phrase
net savings, net margin, net proceeds, or net surplus is used to denote any
income left over after the cooperative has received all of its revenues in that
year and paid all of its costs in that year. The correct terminology, however,
is Patronage Refunds, also called patronage dividends, which are amounts
paid to patrons from the net income of the cooperative on the basis of
quantity or value of business done with these members. These refunds can
be made in cash or retained as equity in the cooperative.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

Balance sheet

A balance sheet summarizes the book value of the assets of a corporation; its liabilities, which are debts that must be repaid; and the member
or owners’ equity or net worth. The accounting identity is that the assets
must equal or be balanced by the sum of liabilities and owners’ equities.
The assets on the cooperative’s balance sheet looks much the same as for a
non-cooperative corporation, but there is one key difference: Investments
in Other Cooperatives reflects any equity a cooperative has in another
cooperative. For example, a cooperative that borrows from a cooperative lender such as CoBank has equity in CoBank. This equity comes
from the patronage refunds retained by CoBank as equity. It is an asset
on the balance sheet for the cooperative and equity on the balance sheet
for CoBank. Patron Refunds Payable is a liability a cooperative must document to account for the cash portion of patronage refunds that are being
paid to members. This term is Dividends Payable in a non-cooperative
corporation.
The members’ equity section of a cooperative’s balance sheet is
the biggest difference in terminology relative to the non-cooperative
corporation. Common Stock or Membership Fees is the value of the membership fee paid by each member. These are fees for a share of purchased
common stock in a stock cooperative or the value of membership certificates in the case of a non-stock cooperative. Allocated Equity, sometimes called Patronage Ledger Credits, Retained Refunds, Capital Retains,
or Revolving Capital, is the value of the patronage refunds retained by
the cooperative equity. The word allocated is used to denote that this is
equity, which has been allocated to the member on the basis

to the dollar value of income derived from business done with members

that was not done on a patronage basis. The board, with input from management, has to decide how to distribute these two types of income, and
has many options from which to choose.
The easiest decision is the distribution of business that is not derived
from patronage done with members. An example of this might be purchases done at a convenience store, such as fuel or in-store purchases. The
cooperative owns the convenience store and members may do business
there on a patronage basis, but it would be expected that nonmembers do
business there as well. This income from nonmembers is not derived from

patronage and is consequently the same as income of a non-cooperative
corporation. Thus, the tax treatment is the same. The cooperative pays
corporate taxes on this income and retains it as equity in the form of
retained earnings in the same way as a non-cooperative corporation. In
this case, the cooperative retains it as Unallocated Equity. A board could
choose to distribute this income to its members as dividends just like a
non-cooperative corporation would do. In that case, the income would be
taxed twice—as corporate income and as individual income. A common
practice by boards of directors is not to allocate this nonmember income
and to retain it as equity.
The board has many choices on how to distribute income derived from
members on a patronage basis. The goal is to implement the service at cost
principle because that is how the member participates in the benefits from
the cooperative. These Patronage Refunds are allocated distributions of net
income to members in proportion to the value or quantity of
their patronage. The distribution process is often referred to

Patronage income distribution choices
and cooperative business units

A board’s choice must take into account the business units of
the cooperative. Consider a cooperative that has one line of
business, which is buying milk from its members and manufacturing it into liquid milk and some butter or cheese
products for consumer consumption. Member are vertically
aligned with the cooperative in one way through milk from
their cows. The cooperative is using one raw material product, milk, to create several types of products. As such, it is reasonable to assume that the cooperative agrees to pool all of
the income derived from the sale of these products into one
patronage pool. All dairy producers share equally, despite
the fact that milk from different members might have different end uses. This is equitable from the members’ perspective
because the overall operation of the plant has similar costs of
processing the raw material product into different end uses.
Each member thus participates equally because of the similar costs of manufacturing the milk into processed products.

CHAPTER THREE: INCOME DISTRIBUTION EQUITY DECISIONS

37

The physical unit of raw material, pounds of milk, is easy to measure, and
the cooperative would link the patronage refund with the quantity of milk
each member sold to the cooperative.
Many cooperatives have just one line of business and it is relatively easy
to treat each member equitably by pooling income from all products into
one patronage pool and, thus, into one level of allocation. Some cooperatives, however, particularly in the farm supply business, have multiple lines
of business including supply of products such as crop nutrients, crop protectants, animal nutrition, refined fuels and related energy products, and
various services associated with agronomy, grain and oilseeds, and energy.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
Each of these products and services has differing costs and net margins,
and there are different risk profiles associated with each product based on
the tools available to the cooperative. In addition, not every member needs
or purchases all of these products and services, and many supply cooperatives also market a members’ feed grains and oilseeds. It thus makes
sense to create multiple patronage pools in order to be equitable with each
member in allocating income from that line of business to the member.
In this example, the physical units are different. Crop nutrients are sold
and measured in tons, crop protectants and refined fuels are measured in
gallons or liters, and grain and oilseeds might be measured in bushels or
tons. Furthermore, services are often bundled with the sale of the product.
A cooperative might have one price for nitrogen fertilizer and application
services and a different price for the purchase of that fertilizer alone. All
of these products likely have different costs and different net margins per
physical unit, and there is likely sharing of variable costs such as labor and
fixed costs such as management. A members’ participation in the benefits
from each product may thus be difficult to determine. Some products may
not have physical units such as a farm equipment tires or credit (in the
case of a financial services cooperative). In such a case, the board would
typically create a patronage pool based on total value rather than physical units, and patronage allocated to the member could be linked with
the members’ proportion of the total value of these types of products. The
board may elect to allocate some of the income derived from members’
patronage into unallocated equity. In doing so, the cooperative must pay
corporate taxes on that income. This choice is not common, but may be
used if the board decides it needs that equity on its balance sheet.
In summary, the board of directors, based on input from management,
makes a decision on the distribution of income. In doing so, it has several choices on handling patronage-sourced and non-patronage sourced
income. Virtually all cooperatives choose to pay corporate taxes on the
non-patronage sourced income and retain it as unallocated equity. On
patronage-sourced income, the board decides how many patronage pools
to operate and how to distribute income from those pools to members.
These choices can be thought of as dividing the income into corporate
taxes, patronage refunds, and retention as unallocated equity. The board
should do what is in the best interest of the member which is to maximize
the after-tax income available as patronage refunds. Operationally, what
boards tend to do is retain the non-patronage sourced income as unallocated equity by paying corporate taxes upon it and distribute the patronage-sourced income as patronage refunds.

CHAPTER THREE: INCOME DISTRIBUTION EQUITY DECISIONS

Choices on tax liability of patronage refunds

When patronage refunds are properly made in accordance with U.S.
Internal Revenue Service tax regulations, they are referred to as qualified
and are deductible for corporate income tax purposes. Thus, cooperatives do not pay corporate taxes which are based on income on qualified
patronage refunds. As described earlier, a non-cooperative corporation is
taxed twice—at both the corporate and individual level—upon distribution of dividends. The majority of boards of directors choose to allocate
patronage-sourced income as a qualified distribution.
A board of directors may choose to allocate the patronage-sourced
income as nonqualified patronage refunds. This is the reverse of distributing patronage refunds as a qualified distribution in that the cooperative pays the corporate income tax on a nonqualified patronage refund.
The member does not pay income tax on this patronage refund until it is
received in cash from the cooperative. Single taxation continues to exist
with nonqualified refunds.
The patronage-sourced income not paid in cash is called a retained
patronage refund, which is the noncash portion of qualified or nonqualified patronage refunds. These patronage refunds are placed on the balance
sheet as allocated equity and members are notified in writing of the value

EXHIBIT 3.6 The rationale for why cooperatives have single taxation of income
The idea that marketing and purchasing cooperatives were not required to pay U.S.
income tax on net income distributed as patronage refunds is based on the concept that
members are extensions of the members’ business through the cooperative, as shown
in the Make or Buy decision. The principle of single-taxation ensures that a cooperative’s net savings are taxed at the cooperative level or the patron level, but not at both.
Non-cooperative corporations have double-taxation, as the net income is taxed at the
corporate level as corporate income and upon distribution to shareholders as corporate
dividends. Business done with nonmembers is treated the same as non-cooperative
businesses and taxed by the cooperative. This taxation of farmer cooperatives, as well as
of other corporations operating on a cooperative basis, is defined in subchapter T of the
Internal Revenue Code. This difference reflects cooperatives’ distinct way of distributing
net margins to their patrons based on use, rather than to investors based on investment.
It was the intent of policymakers to have single taxation because the patronage refunds
or dividends were either rebates to patrons of a part of the price initially paid by them on
purchases made through a cooperative or an additional cost paid by a marketing cooperative to patrons for products sold to the cooperative. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service
Subchapter T applies to “any corporation operating on a cooperative basis” except mutual
savings banks, mutual insurance companies, and cooperatives engaged in furnishing
electric energy or telephone service to rural areas. Cooperatives can exclude from their
taxable income certain distributions of net income or allocations paid patrons.

39

40

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
of these patronage refunds allocated but not paid in cash. Remember that
the accounting identity states that equity is equivalent to the difference
between assets and liabilities. Thus, these retained patronage refunds
represent investments in new assets or reinvestment in existing assets to
maintain them in good condition to provide the products and services
desired by members to satisfy them as customers. Remember also that
total equity is the sum of allocated equity and unallocated equity. Historically, boards of directors have chosen to have as much of their equity
as possible in allocated equity relative to unallocated equity, although in
recent years boards have chosen to increase their unallocated equity.

Equity redemption program choice has implications for the balance sheet

Patronage refunds retained by a board of directors may be redeemed in
the future if the board decides it no longer needs that equity. Allocated
equity is created through retention of patronage refunds, while redemption of retained patronage refunds can be thought of as destroying allocated equity. This has implications for a cooperative’s balance sheet.
There are two situations in which a board must have a policy to handle retained patronage refunds. The first is when a member stops being
a member. Cooperatives universally operate on the philosophy that if a
member stops being a member, any equity that member has in the form
of retained patronage refunds should be redeemed. In general, consumers
are no longer members of a cooperative if they move geographically from
the community or some period of time elapses in which they no longer
patronize the cooperative. Farmers are no longer members of an agricultural cooperative if they retire or exit their farming operation. Obviously,
consumers and farmers are no longer members when they die. The second
situation is a determination of much equity is needed by the cooperative.
If a cooperative continues to create allocated equity each year by retaining
patronage refunds, the cooperative may have excess allocated equity that
may not be needed for asset investment or replacement of existing assets.
Boards of directors have set up various practices to handle these situations. First, a board must determine whether it has the ability to redeem
this allocated equity without disrupting its existing loan covenants or
asset expenditures. If a member dies, the board of directors typically
redeems the allocated equity, which is that member’s retained patronage
refund. This might be done monthly or annually. For a member who is
alive but no longer a member, the board creates a policy to redeem that
equity. A common policy is to redeem a portion of the allocated equity
over a period of time, which could be four or five years in the future.

CHAPTER THREE: INCOME DISTRIBUTION EQUITY DECISIONS
The second situation is where the board considers redeeming retained
patronage refunds for a member who is still an active member. Once the
board makes the determination that it does not need additional equity,
boards must create a policy to handle this situation. The universal practice
is to redeem the allocated equity based on the birth year of the patronage
refund, with the oldest equity being redeemed first. This practice is fair
since there is no dividend being paid on the allocated equity which was
created when the patronage refund was retained. There is no trigger to
redeem the equity, but in practice, many boards of directors try to manage member expectations by redeeming the retained patronage refunds in
a timely manner with a pattern of behavior. For cooperatives that operate
on a pooling basis where the deduction of a per capita retain is analogous
to the retained patronage refund, these deductions may be significant,
and the board seeks to have a rapid redemption period in perhaps five to
ten years. In cooperatives where the retained patronage refund may not
be as high, a redemption period may be longer. For example, a member of
an electrical utility cooperative may have a redemption period of decades,
since the member uses electricity for the span of their lifetime. In general, however, boards of directors try to redeem these retained patronage
refunds as quickly as possible without compromising the balance sheet.

Summary

Two of the three ways members participate in a cooperative or mutual
are through benefits received and physical ownership. The impacts of

EXHIBIT 3.7 Equity redemption by patron birth year in certain farm supply
and grain marketing cooperatives in the United States
For various reasons related to a competitive environment, taxes, the nature of their relationship with wholesale supply cooperatives, and desire to provide a retirement income,
many farm supply and grain marketing cooperatives in the early 1960s chose to redeem
retained patronage refunds at a trigger point, based on the birth year of the member. A
common practice was to redeem allocated equity when a member turned 65 years of age,
because it was assumed that the farmer would retire from farming. This practice helped the
cooperative’s cash flow at first, since few farmers were that old. However, because many
farmers were of similar age, it became a major problem. In addition, young farmers did not
like the idea of having patronage refunds retained for decades until redemption. In multigenerational farming families, the oldest member has an incentive to purchase all of the
products and services in that member’s name to have their equity redeemed faster, which
results in the younger member being-under invested in the cooperative. The majority of
cooperatives practicing this method have transitioned off these programs to a revolving
fund whereby the oldest equity is redeemed first.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
these on an individual member can be seen by observing the impact of
the economic transaction between the member and the cooperative or
mutual. These impacts can be traced through the income statement and
balance sheet, and the decisions of the board of directors who are elected
by the members and management are observable. Boards of directors create policies regarding income distribution and equity generation, which
are embedded in principles contained in legal statutes and accounting
standards. It is important for members to understand these concepts to
fully understand the role of their membership in a cooperative or mutual
and their impact on the decision-making by the board and management.
Members participate in the control of the cooperative by electing directors
who make these decisions on ownership and benefits on their behalf.

Special topics in cooperatives and mutualism

The previous chapters discuss cooperatives as firms, member participation
in cooperatives or mutuals, and how participation is carried out through a
cooperative’s financial statements and board decisions. This chapter introduces a number of current topics in cooperation and mutualism.

Limited exemption from antitrust laws

Many countries with market economies have laws designed to ensure
certain fair business practices are followed. One practice is to prohibit
restraints or attempts to monopolize trade or commerce by businesses.
This includes investigation of mergers that might lead to restraints or possible monopolies of trade or commerce. Price fixing is one practice that is
illegal. Because farmers are individual businesses, the formation of a cooperative to collectively set a price at which the cooperative might sell the
members agricultural products was considered price fixing. Legislation
such as the Capper-Volstead Act in the U.S. was created to enable cooperatives to engage in certain practices—to collectively market and bargain,
set prices, cooperate with other cooperatives, create contracts with buyers
and suppliers, or limit membership. Cooperatives have this exemption
only if they have members who are agricultural producers, cannot engage
in predatory pricing, and cannot attempt to create a vertical supply curve
by engaging in practices to limit the supply of members’ products. These
laws are unique to cooperatives. Baseball has a limited exemption from
antitrust, and other industries have legal protections for manufacturer-imposed dealings or requirements contracts.

Use in agricultural and community development programs

Many international development programs that operate in agriculture
and rural development promote the cooperative structure of business. The
AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM

43

44

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
rationale is that, because of its foundations in principles associated with
democracy and collective decision-making, the structure is appealing to
economic development at a grass roots level. It has been widely used to create food marketing cooperatives in such products as cocoa, coffee, dairy,
and certain types of vegetables, and in many African, Southeast Asian, Oceania, and Latin American countries. Many countries have adopted favorable practices to encourage the development of cooperatives, including
public investments in applied research, technical assistance, and studies on
the economic impact of cooperatives and mutual insurance firms.

Pricing strategies

The cooperative principle of “service at cost” was widely used as an idea of
how cooperatives should operate. While it sounds reasonable, its application as a management strategy has problems if taken literally. Some members interpret it to mean that cooperatives should operate as non-profits,
with zero or close to zero patronage refunds each year. Others see it as a
requirement to follow an average cost or uniform pricing strategy and set
the price the same for all of their members, regardless of size or volume.
When cooperatives are first formed, often times the members are considered homogeneous in that the farms are of similar size or scale and with
a similar social purpose. Neither of these practices, however, will lead to a
cooperative achieving an economic purpose and surviving. In the first case,
there will never be any income to reinvest in the cooperative’s assets. In the
second case, there is a better and more equitable pricing strategy, which is
equal margin pricing, which recognizes that there are differences in providing a product or service and as long as the cooperative charges the same
margin per member, volume discounts or premiums are justifiable.

Why is the number of agricultural cooperatives declining worldwide?

Much has been written about the declining number of cooperatives and
membership in cooperatives, especially in agricultural cooperatives in
the U.S. and Western Europe. However, when compared to the number
of agricultural producers, data suggest that the number of producers has
declined more rapidly than the number of cooperatives. Public data on
cooperatives in the U.S. suggests that by far the most common reason for
the decline in numbers is mergers or unifications between cooperatives,
and this consolidation is expected to continue.

Organizing the governance of cooperatives

Globally, cooperatives have organized themselves in one of three types of
membership structures: centralized, federated, and a combination of cen-

CHAPTER FOUR: CURRENT ISSUES IN COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALISM
tralized and federated. There is no right or wrong structure. A centralized
structure is one in which members are individuals. This model works well
when members are in close geographical proximity to the cooperative,
and has the advantage of communication about the cooperative’s purpose and ability to operate as a true democratic form of governance system. Directors are elected from the membership based on geographical
districts or chosen at large. Some wholesaling cooperatives have centralized their structure entirely by merging some or all individual cooperative
members into one cooperative. In federated cooperatives, each member
is a cooperative. This resembles a republican form of government such as
the U.S. and its 50 states. Directors are chosen from among the members
of the cooperative, can include managers, farmers, or consumers, and
often reflect proportional voting based on business volume.
Some wholesaling type cooperatives have a combination of the two
structures. There is no right or wrong answer, but members should
choose the structure that best fits and communicates the cooperative’s
economic purpose, and consider its impact on the three ways members
participate in the cooperative: 1) governance (which structure provides
the best qualified directors), 2) benefits (which structure creates the
best customer transaction and after-tax cash flow to the members), and
3) ownership (which structure creates the best equity structure that takes
into account the member’s life cycle and ensures that they are invested
proportional to their use in the cooperative).

Hybrid cooperative organizational forms

Some cooperatives have organized themselves into so-called hybrids by
retaining their cooperative governance as much as possible but allowing
outside investors to invest in the cooperative. In the U.S., these blend elements of mutual-benefit companies and investor-benefit firms, especially
limited liability companies. These are rare in the U.S. relative to traditional cooperatives. In all cases, members control the board of directors
with a supermajority and retain the board chairmanship; non-members
are allowed on the board of directors. In certain countries in the European Union, legislation states that members of employee unions or management may be on the board of directors.

The “new generation” cooperative phenomenon in the United States

The so-called “new generation cooperatives” began occurring in the U.S.
in the late 1990s, with producers vertically integrating into processing
cooperatives such as corn-ethanol, durum wheat for pasta, sugar beets
for sugar and co-products, and other commodities. These cooperatives

45

46

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
were referred to as “new-generation” because they differed from previous
types of cooperative formation. The membership was defined and linked
explicitly through contractual marketing agreements with the capacity of
the processing plant. For example, a 50 million gallon corn-ethanol plant
might require 18 million bushels of corn. Thus, the cooperative would sell
18 million delivery rights linked with physical units such as bushels, and
commit members to physically deliver 18 million bushels of corn.
These delivery rights might require a minimum investment such as
10,000 bushels, in which case the membership would be defined as no
more than 1,800 members (18 million bushels divided by 10,000 bushels).
The total cost of the processing plant would be determined through a
business plan and members would be required to invest up to a certain
amount, which might be 70% of the total cost. If this corn-ethanol plant
had a cost of $35 million, then $24.5 million would be required before
the business plan would be implemented. The upfront cost per producer
would be $1.36 per bushel ($24.5 million divided by 18 million bushels)
or a minimum investment of $13,611 ($1.36 multiplied by 10,000 bushels).
Thus, a member would be entitled to a patronage refund obtained from
the processing of corn into ethanol and its co-products.
This patronage refund would be expressed in dollars per bushel and
would be the value obtained above and beyond the market price of corn
received when the cooperative purchased the corn from the member.
A new generation cooperative had a defined membership with defined
responsibilities of each member, including a contractual delivery right
and corresponding share in control through participation in governance.
Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests that more than
200 business plans were written for investments in processing assets,
with less than half actually conducting membership drives for investment and perhaps 75 actually building a processing plant. Sugar beet processing and corn-ethanol plants had government policies, which helped
their formation and economic viability. Several others had great success,
including U.S. Premium Beef and Dakota Growers Pasta, but they demutualized and were acquired by outside investors. Others, such as South
Dakota Soybean Processors and a number of corn-ethanol cooperatives,
converted to different forms of closely held organizations. In 2017, there
are estimated to be less than 30 cooperatives who have maintained their
“new generation” cooperative status.

CHAPTER FOUR: CURRENT ISSUES IN COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALISM

Demutualization: a rare but often studied
event in cooperatives and mutuals

When members of a cooperative or mutual insurance company decide
to sell their cooperative or convert to a publicly-held company, which is
referred to as demutualization, it gets a lot of attention. Historically, this
is a very rare event, with less than 0.01% of the cooperatives tracked over
time by the U.S. Department of Agriculture voting to be acquired by a
non-cooperative corporation or to demutualize. Cooperatives that were
acquired by other firms include Birds Eye Foods, U.S. Premium Beef, and
Dakota Growers Pasta. Examples of demutualization include Diamond
Walnut Growers, California Avocado Cooperative, FCStone, and Goldkist. A number of processing cooperatives formed in the late 1990s and
early 2000s converted from cooperatives to limited liability partnerships
because of tax issues; these are not demutualizations since they are still
held by members. Common reasons why cooperatives may experience
internal conflict among their membership include free ridership, differing
time horizons among members with regard to investments in long-term
assets, differing tolerance for risk among asset investments, issues in control with regards to information between management and members, and
influence costs as the complexity grows in an organization with more lines
of business units. These problems are more likely as a cooperative becomes
larger and more complex. Despite these issues, cooperatives have flourished in the U.S. and worldwide. The fact that most cooperative members
come from multi-generational farming families is likely a reason why there
are so few bankruptcies or demutualizations in U.S. agricultural cooperatives. The very few that have happened can trace the reasons to one or
more of the issues above; many were wholesaling type cooperatives.

The current restructuring of ‘mixed’ or multi-purpose farm supply
and grain / oilseed marketing cooperatives in the United States

Farm supply and grain marketing cooperatives in the U.S. have made billions of dollars in asset investments since 2004. This is the biggest change
in this particular cooperative sector since these cooperatives were first
formed. There are various reasons for this level of investment. Crop volumes have increased in the U.S. as crop yields in corn and soybeans have
increased through improvements in seed varieties and planting technologies (such as narrower rows resulting in increased seed densities per
acre). In addition, cropping patterns have changed as corn and soybean
seed varieties have been developed for geographic regions that historically
could produce only small grains such as wheat and barley. Finally, reductions in the average planting and harvesting times, which have almost been

47

48

AN INTRODUCTION TO COOPERATION AND MUTUALISM
halved due to greater horsepower being used by farmers, have placed a
strain on logistics.

Collective farming movements

Communal ownership of agricultural land exists in different places in the
world. One well-known example is the kibbutzim in Israel, which collectively owned agricultural land and were governed much like a cooperative. Hutterite colonies in North America follow a similar process, with
the exception that women have no role in governance. Communal ownership of land did exist in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union with
the collectives and communes. Members, however, did not participate in
governance, so strategic decisions such as what to plant and what machinery to purchase were not made by the board in a manner associated with
democratic control. Furthermore, the development of these structures
was not voluntary. Other countries with communist or socialist governments experimented with similar type structures during the 20th century.

Economic impact of cooperatives and mutuals

The University of Wisconsin at Madison conducted a multi-year research
project to document the economic impact of cooperatives, including
mutuals, in the U.S. economy. This extensive and well-done research has
resulted in greater understanding of the role cooperatives play in the U.S.
economy. For the year 2013, they report that nearly 30,000 U.S. cooperatives operated at 73,000 places of business throughout the country, with
more than $3 trillion in assets generating over $500 billion in gross revenues. The study reported almost 340 million consumer co-op memberships and another 10 million agricultural cooperative memberships.

The role of faith in cooperative development

Religious neutrality has been a hallmark of cooperative principles regarding membership. Despite that, various faith-based organizations have
played key roles in several countries with the development of cooperatives
and mutuals. For example, the Catholic Worker Movement helped form
manufacturing type worker cooperatives in the greater Mondragón region
in Spain. Similarly, in the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy, the Catholic
Worker Movement helped form a broad collection of consumer cooperatives engaged in various retail businesses. The Knights of Columbus is
based in Catholic parishes and provides a strong set of community-based
volunteer efforts. Thrivent Financial was formerly a fraternal benefit mutual insurance with membership limited to Lutherans. It has since broad-

CHAPTER FOUR: CURRENT ISSUES IN COOPERATIVES AND MUTUALISM
ened its membership to a broader set of Christians and is active in community volunteerism, especially Habitat for Humanity.

Summary

Cooperatives and mutual continue to thrive globally. These forms of collective action are not the solution to every economic or social problem.
Changes in how various forms of collective action utilize these models
is to be expected and, as discussed earlier, cooperatives that move from
strictly a social purpose to an economic purpose tend to succeed over
time. It is important to maintain some social purpose within the collection action to help members understand their membership roles and
responsibilities. Periodically, some academics and practitioners become
concerned that cooperatives and mutuals are outdated or have lost their
way. The measurable evidence is quite clear that this is not the case. Legal
business forms change over time as policy and legislation change often in
response to tax treatment of income. Mutual benefit organizational forms
such as cooperatives and mutuals continue to play an important role in
the global economy.

Summary and conclusions

Cooperatives and mutuals are firms. The choice of organizational form is
based on a number of issues. As discussed in these chapters, these choices
depend on the economic costs of the Make or Buy Decision and the ownership structure desired, which may include consumers, investors, producers, suppliers, and workers. Cooperation and mutualism are based on
the desire to Make something which is owned by consumers, producers,
suppliers, and workers, but not by investors. These owners have chosen
to vertically integrate their business or household through a cooperative
or mutual. Social reasons may underlie why they decide to do so but ultimately, in a market economy, the economic transaction by a customer will
determine the success of the cooperative or mutual.
A number of thought leaders, including Nobel Prize Laureates, have
been recognized for their contributions into understanding this Make or
Buy decision. A cooperative or mutual is collectively owned, in most cases,
by a large group of consumers, producers, suppliers, and workers. A large
ownership structure helps create an equity structure on a balance sheet
that enables the cooperative or mutual to survive business shocks and
cycles. For example, in an agricultural cooperative with highly perishable
perennial crops, the concept of a marketing year is important. Building an
ownership structure that enables the cooperative to simultaneously help
its owners survive each year and add value to their agricultural commodities over the coming marketing year when the full value is not known until
12 months after harvest is crucial. Similarly, a mutual insurance firm must
have an ownership structure that enables it to insure the risk profile of its
members, which may not be fully understood but yet allow it to offer competitive premiums to purchase the insurance.
This decision to Make something must be understood within the
context that ownership structure also includes those who patronize the

cooperative or mutual and share in its economic success based on the volume of business transacted with the cooperative or mutual. These owners participate in the control of the cooperative or mutual through their
election of directors who monitor their ownership and through their
direct participation in certain activities as presented in their articles of
incorporation and bylaws. This control function, which is part of corporate governance, may be accomplished through democratic voting (onemember-one-vote), proportional voting based on business volume, or a
combination of the two.
Members in a cooperative and mutual thus participate in the economic benefits, ownership, and control of the firm. Because of this participation, an important function of cooperatives and mutuals is education of their members. This education includes knowledge on the three
ways of participation and the roles of responsibilities of membership. As
a closed buying or supply channel, cooperatives function best when the
majority of their business is done with members. The financial decisions
of a cooperative are probably hardest for any member to understand due
to economic and social issues.
There is no evidence to suggest that the cooperative or mutual form
of business is no longer a viable business model. Indeed, many examples
of successful cooperatives and mutuals exist globally. Certainly industry
conditions may change, and if a cooperative or mutual does not change
its strategy to reflect changing industry conditions, the economic viability of the business may be called into question. Furthermore, if issues of
property rights are not clarified, members may become dissatisfied with
remaining a member of the cooperative or mutual and may seek to demutualize. Such incidences are rare but widely studied by academics.

GLOSSARY

Glossary

The accounting identity states that Total Assets is equal to the sum of Total Liabilities and Total Equity.
Allocated equity is sometimes called Patronage Ledger Credits, Retained Refunds,
Capital Retains, or Revolving Capital, and is the value of the patronage refunds retained
by the cooperative equity. The word allocated is used to denote that this is equity, which
has been allocated to the member based on patronage.
Articles of incorporation for a cooperative describe the type of organization,
purpose, number of shares of common stock and any preferred stock, number of directors and how a member votes on those directors, legal definition of membership, location of the headquarters (the legal address for the cooperative), and asset disposal upon
liquidation.
Bargaining cooperatives negotiate with processors and other first handlers for a
collective price and terms of trade for their members.
Bylaws are the rules or policies that explain how any organization, including cooperatives, operates. The bylaws of a cooperative define the purpose of the cooperative and its
geographical location, who a member is and what rights are associated with membership, how disputes are addressed, how membership may be terminated, how the organization can change its rules and policies, how a meeting of the membership is to be held,
and what can occur at that meeting.
The cooperative as a competitive yardstick is a well-known analogy for justifying why cooperatives are often thought of as promoting competition because they
allow members to join together to obtain marketing power to negotiate on behalf of
their members.
Cooperation refers to businesses formed for mutual benefit, controlled by users who
are customers, and operated principally to provide benefits to users. The benefits are
provided to users based on participation, not ownership, and include the purchasing or
selling business transactions customers have with the cooperative and the profits earned
by the cooperative on those transactions that are returned to the users.
In a consumer cooperative, the goods and services provided by the cooperative are
consumed by the members.

Electric utility cooperatives were developed in the 1930s to provide electricity. In
the 21st century, many are providing internet capability through satellites or broadband.
Free rider problem exists when the value of membership is diluted because nonmembers can share in benefits without having to be a member.
Health care cooperatives are a lot like mutual insurance firms in that their objective is to pool risk across members and provide health care with lower fees.
A housing cooperative owns the land, facility, and common areas such as indoor
or outdoor recreational equipment and common meeting space. Members buy a share
in the cooperative, which is an ownership interest in a unit within the housing cooperative. There are many types of housing cooperatives. Members pay a monthly fee for
budgeted expenses such as operating costs and capital investments to maintain the cooperative’s assets.
Governance is a system of system of processes by which a company is directed and
controlled. Governance of cooperatives involves balancing the interests of the members
with the goals of the cooperative as a business.
Make-or-buy decision refers to a decision by a producer or consumer to make a
choice of vertically integrating through their membership in the cooperative to produce
a product or simply buying it from the market.
A marketing agency-in-common is a cooperative whose members are other cooperatives who have joined together to jointly market the products of all members.
Marketing year For many agricultural crops that are processed as ingredients into
other food products or processed into a consumer product, the value of the crop grown
by the producer as a raw material for these ingredient and consumer products is not
known at harvest but becomes known over the next 12 months as the supply of the crop
is processed and before the new harvest occurs. This 12-month period is known as the
marketing year and in the northern hemisphere typically begins September 1 or October
1 in the current year, which is harvest when the supply of the crop is greatest, and ends
August 31 or September 30 of the next year.
Mutualism is often linked with mutual insurance firms which are owned by their policyholders, and income is retained to reduce future insurance premiums.
Participation describes how a member uses the cooperative to share in its benefits.
Investor-benefit businesses do not require participation in the business as a customer.
Patronage refund is analogous to net income, but is income from doing business
with members which is linked with a members’ participation in the cooperative. It is the
patronage income derived from the operation of the cooperative on a cooperative basis.
In a producer cooperative the cooperative markets products supplied by members.

A property right is a legally enforced right to select the uses of an economic good
produced by a firm
Unallocated equity, which can be thought of as unallocated, retained earnings, or
Unallocated Reserves or Surplus, is equity not allocated to the member based on their
patronage. For most cooperatives, this is non-patronage income or any other income on
which the cooperative has paid corporate income tax.
A worker cooperative is a business entity that is owned and controlled by the members who are laborers and work in the business.
