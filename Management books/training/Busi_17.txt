Introduction

The business world is often equated to an ecosystem: the environment is comprised of interacting organizations
and individuals much like the biological ecosystem (Moore, 1993). Entrepreneurship is no different, as it can
be thought of as its own ecosystem, with new ventures being created, maturing, needing to adapt, or becoming
extinct. Much like the biological ecosystem, in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, change occurs and gives rise to
opportunity or presents challenges. It is important to consider the various levels of the ecosystem when evaluating
the entrepreneurial environment. For example, the ecosystems can be analyzed at a macro level such as the
terrestrial ecosystem in biology or the national economy in entrepreneurship. Additionally, ecosystems can be
analyzed at more micro levels like the rain forest ecosystem in biology or the firm level in entrepreneurship.

Chapter 1 – Introduction to Entrepreneurship

Whilst there is no universally accepted definition of entrepreneurship, it is fair to say that it is multidimensional. It involves analyzing people and their actions together with the ways in which they interact
with their environments, be these social, economic, or political, and the institutional, policy, and legal
frameworks that help define and legitimize human activities. – Blackburn (2011, p. xiii)
Entrepreneurship involves such a range of activities and levels of analysis that no single definition is
definitive. – Lichtenstein (2011, p. 472)
It is complex, chaotic, and lacks any notion of linearity. As educators, we have the responsibility to
develop our students’ discovery, reasoning, and implementation skills so they may excel in highly uncertain
environments. – Neck and Greene (2011, p. 55)

Overview
This chapter provides you with an overview of entrepreneurship and of the language of entrepreneurship. The
challenges associated with defining entrepreneur and entrepreneurship are explored, as is an overview of how
entrepreneurship can be studied.
The objective is to enable you to apply current concepts in entrepreneurship to the evaluation of entrepreneurs,
their ventures, and the venturing environment. You will develop skills, including the capability to add value in the
new venture sector of the economy. You will acquire and practice evaluation skills useful in consulting, advising,
and making new venture decisions.

Entrepreneurs and Entrepreneurship
Considerations Influencing Definitions of Entrepreneur and Entrepreneurship
It is necessary to be able to determine exactly who entrepreneurs are before we can, among other things, study
them, count them, provide special loans for them, and calculate how and how much they contribute to our
economy.
• Does someone need to start a business from scratch to be called an entrepreneur?
• Can we call someone an entrepreneur if they bought an ongoing business from someone else or took
over the operations of a family business from their parents?
• If someone starts a small business and never needs to hire employees, can they be called an
entrepreneur?
• If someone buys a business but hires professional managers to run it so they don’t have to be involved
in the operations, are they an entrepreneur?
• Is someone an entrepreneur if they buy into a franchise so they can follow a well-established formula
for running the operation?
• Is someone an entrepreneur because of what they do or because of how they think?
• Can someone be an entrepreneur without owning their own business?
• Can a person be an entrepreneur because of the nature of the work that they do within a large
corporation?
It is also necessary to fully understand what we mean by entrepreneurship before we can study the concept.
Gartner (1990) identified 90 attributes that showed up in definitions of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship
provided by entrepreneurs and other experts in the field. The following are a few of these attributes:
• Innovation – Does a person need to be innovative to be considered an entrepreneur? Can an activity be
considered to be entrepreneurial if it is not innovative?

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 4

• Activities – What activities does a person need to do to be considered an entrepreneur?
• Creation of a new business – Does someone need to start a new business to be considered to be an
entrepreneur, or can someone who buys a business, buys into a franchise, or takes over an existing
family business be considered an entrepreneur?
• Starts an innovative venture within an established organization – Can someone who works within an
existing organization that they don’t own be considered an entrepreneur if they start an innovative
venture for their organization?
• Creation of a not-for-profit business – Can a venture be considered to be entrepreneurial if it is a notfor-profit, or should only for-profit businesses be considered entrepreneurial?
After identifying the 90 attributes, Gartner (1990) went back to the entrepreneurs and other experts for help in
clustering the attributes into themes that would help summarize what people concerned with entrepreneurship
thought about the concept. He ended up with the following eight entrepreneurship themes:
1. The Entrepreneur – The entrepreneur theme is the idea that entrepreneurship involves individuals
with unique personality characteristics and abilities (e.g., risk-taking, locus of control, autonomy,
perseverance, commitment, vision, creativity). Almost 50% of the respondents rated these characteristics
as not important to a definition of entrepreneurship (Gartner, 1990, p. 21, 24).
• “The question that needs to be addressed is: Does entrepreneurship involve entrepreneurs
(individuals with unique characteristics)?” (Gartner, 1990, p. 25).
2. Innovation – The innovation theme is characterized as doing something new as an idea, product,
service, market, or technology in a new or established organization. The innovation theme suggests
that innovation is not limited to new ventures, but recognized as something which older and/or larger
organizations may undertake as well (Gartner, 1990, p. 25). Some of the experts Gartner questioned
believed that it was important to include innovation in definitions of entrepreneurship and others did not
think it was as important.
• “Does entrepreneurship involve innovation?” (Gartner, 1990, p. 25).
3. Organization Creation – The organization creation theme describes the behaviors involved in creating
organizations. This theme described acquiring and integrating resource attributes (e.g., Brings resources
to bear, integrates opportunities with resources, mobilizes resources, gathers resources) and attributes
that described creating organizations (new venture development and the creation of a business that adds
value). (Gartner, 1990, p. 25)
• “Does entrepreneurship involve resource acquisition and integration (new venture creation
activities)?” (Gartner, 1990, p. 25)

5 • LEE A. SWANSON

4. Creating Value – This theme articulated the idea that entrepreneurship creates value. The attributes in
this factor indicated that value creation might be represented by transforming a business, creating a new
business growing a business, creating wealth, or destroying the status quo.
• “Does entrepreneurship involve creating value?” (Gartner, 1990, p. 25).
5. Profit or Nonprofit
• “Does entrepreneurship involve profit-making organizations only” (Gartner, 1990, p. 25)?
6. Growth
• Should a focus on growth be a characteristic of entrepreneurship?
7. Uniqueness – This theme suggested that entrepreneurship must involve uniqueness. Uniqueness was
characterized by attributes such as a special way of thinking, a vision of accomplishment, ability to see
situations in terms of unmet needs, and creates a unique combination.
• “Does entrepreneurship involve uniqueness?” (Gartner, 1990, p. 26).
8. The Owner-Manager – Some of the respondents questioned by Gartner (1990) did not believe that small
mom-and-pop types of businesses should be considered to be entrepreneurial. Some respondents felt that
an important element of a definition of entrepreneurship was that a venture be owner-managed.
• To be entrepreneurial, does a venture need to be owner-managed?
Examples of Definitions of Entrepreneur
An entrepreneur can be described as “one who creates a new business in the face of risk and uncertainty for
the purpose of achieving profit and growth by identifying significant opportunities and assembling the necessary
resources to capitalize on them” (Zimmerer & Scarborough, 2008, p. 5).
An entrepreneur is “one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise” (Entrepreneur,
n.d.).
Examples of Definitions of Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship can be defined as a field of business that
seeks to understand how opportunities to create something new (e.g., new products or services,
new markets, new production processes or raw materials, new ways of organizing existing
technologies) arise and are discovered or created by specific persons, who then use various means
to exploit or develop them, thus producing a wide range of effects (Baron, Shane, & Reuber,
2008, p. 4)

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 6

A concise definition of entrepreneurship “is that it is the process of pursuing opportunities without limitation
by resources currently in hand” (Brooks, 2009, p. 3) and “the process of doing something new and something
different for the purpose of creating wealth for the individual and adding value to society” (Kao, 1993, p. 70)

The Evolution of Entrepreneurship Thought
This section includes an overview of how entrepreneurship has evolved to the present day.
The following timeline shows some of the most influential entrepreneurship scholars and the schools of thought
(French, English, American, German, and Austrian) their perspectives helped influence and from which their
ideas evolved. Schools of thought are essentially groups of people who might or might not have personally known
each other, but who shared common beliefs or philosophies.

The Earliest Entrepreneurship
The function, if not the name, of the entrepreneur is probably as old as the institutions of barter and exchange. But
only after economic markets became an intrusive element of society did the concept take on pivotal importance.
Many economists have recognized the pivotal role of the entrepreneur in a market economy. Yet despite his
central importance in economic activity, the entrepreneur has been a shadowy and elusive figure in the history of
economic theory (Hebert & Link, 2009, p. 1).
Historically those who acted similarly to the ways we associate with modern day entrepreneurs – namely those
who strategically assume risks to seek economic (or other) gains – were military leaders, royalty, or merchants.
Military leaders planned their campaigns and battles while assuming significant risks, but by doing so they also
stood to gain economic benefits if their strategies were successful. Merchants, like Marco Polo who sailed out of

7 • LEE A. SWANSON

Venice in the late 1200s to search for a trade route to the Orient, also assumed substantial risks in the hope of
becoming wealthy (Hebert & Link, 2009).
The entrepreneur, who was also called adventurer, projector, and undertaker during the eighteenth century, was
not always viewed in a positive light (Hebert & Link, 2009).
Development of Entrepreneurship as a Concept
Risk and Uncertainty
Richard Cantillon (1680-1734) was born in France and belonged to the French School of thought although he was
an Irish economist. He appears to be the person who introduced the term entrepreneur to the world. “According
to Cantillon, the entrepreneur is a specialist in taking on risk, ‘insuring’ workers by buying their output for resale
before consumers have indicated how much they are willing to pay for it” (Casson & Godley, 2005p. 26). The
workers’ incomes are mostly stable, but the entrepreneur risks a loss if market prices fluctuate.
Cantillon distinguished entrepreneurs from two other classes of economic agents; landowners, who were
financially independent, and hirelings (employees) who did not partake in the decision-making in exchange for
relatively stable incomes through employment contracts. He was the first writer to provide a relatively refined
meaning for the term entrepreneurship. Cantillon described entrepreneurs as individuals who generated profits
through exchanges. In the face of uncertainty, particularly over future prices, they exercise business judgment.
They purchase resources at one price and sell their product at a price that is uncertain, with the difference
representing their profit (Chell, 2008; Hebert & Link, 2009).
Farmers were the most prominent entrepreneurs during Cantillon’s lifetime, and they interacted with
“arbitrageurs” – or middlemen between farmers and the end consumers – who also faced uncertain incomes, and
who were also, therefore, entrepreneurs. These intermediaries facilitated the movement of products from the farms
to the cities where more than half of the farm output was consumed. Cantillon observed that consumers were
willing to pay a higher price per unit to be able to purchase products in the smaller quantities they wanted, which
created the opportunities for the intermediaries to make profits. Profits were the rewards for assuming the risks
arising from uncertain conditions. The markets in which profits were earned were characterized by incomplete
information (Chell, 2008; Hebert & Link, 2009).
Adolph Reidel (1809-1872), form the German School of thought, picked up on Cantillon’s notion of uncertainty
and extended it to theorize that entrepreneurs take on uncertainty so others, namely income earners, do not have
to be subject to the same uncertainty. Entrepreneurs provide a service to risk-averse income earners by assuming
risk on their behalf. In exchange, entrepreneurs are rewarded when they can foresee the impacts of the uncertainty
and sell their products at a price that exceeds their input costs (including the fixed costs of the wages they commit
to paying) (Hebert & Link, 2009).
Frank Knight (1885-1972) founded the Chicago School of Economics and belonged to the American School
of thought. He refined Cantillon’s perspective on entrepreneurs and risk by distinguishing insurable risk as
something that is separate from uncertainty, which is not insurable. Some risks can be insurable because they have

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 8

occurred enough times in the past that the expected loss from such risks can be calculated. Uncertainty, on the
other hand, is not subject to probability calculations. According to Knight, entrepreneurs can’t share the risk of
loss by insuring themselves against uncertain events, so they bear these kinds of risks themselves, and profit is the
reward that entrepreneurs get from assuming uninsurable risks (Casson & Godley, 2005).
Distinction Between Entrepreneur and Manager
Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832), also from the French School, advanced Cantillon’s work, but added that
entrepreneurship was essentially a form of management. Say “put the entrepreneur at the core of the entire process
of production and distribution” (Hebert & Link, 2009, p. 17). Say’s work resulted in something similar to a general
theory of entrepreneurship with three distinct functions; “scientific knowledge of the product; entrepreneurial
industry – the application of knowledge to useful purpose; and productive industry – the manufacture of the item
by manual labour” (Chell, 2008, p. 20).
Frank Knight made several contributions to entrepreneurship theory, but another of note is how he distinguished
an entrepreneur from a manager. He suggested that a manager crosses the line to become an entrepreneur “when
the exercise of his/her judgment is liable to error and s/he assumes the responsibility for its correctness” (Chell,
2008, p. 33). Knight said that entrepreneurs calculate the risks associated with uncertain business situations and
make informed judgments and decisions with the expectation that – if they assessed the situation and made the
correct decisions – they would be rewarded by earning a profit. Those who elect to avoid taking these risks choose
the relative security of being employees (Chell, 2008).
Alfred Marshall (1842-1924), from the English School of thought, was one of the founders of neoclassical
economics. His research involved distinguishing between the terms capitalist, entrepreneur, and manager.
Marshall saw capitalists as individuals who “committed themselves to the capacity and honesty of others, when
he by himself had incurred the risks for having contributed with the capital” (Zaratiegui & Rabade, 2005, p. 775).
An entrepreneur took control of money provided by capitalists in an effort to leverage it to create more money;
but would lose less if something went wrong then would the capitalists. An entrepreneur, however, risked his own
reputation and the other gains he could have made by pursuing a different opportunity.
Let us suppose that two men are carrying on smaller businesses, the one working with his own,
the other chiefly with borrowed capital. There is one set of risks which is common to both; which
may be described as the trade risks of the particular business … But there is another set of risks,
the burden of which has to be borne by the man working with borrowed capital, and not by the
other; and we may call them personal risks (Marshall, 1961, p. 590; Zaratiegui & Rabade, 2005,
p. 776).
Marshall recognized that the reward capitalists received for contributing capital was interest income and the
reward entrepreneurs earned was profits. Managers received a salary and, according to Marshall, fulfilled a
different function than either capitalists or entrepreneurs – although in some cases, particularly in smaller firms,
one person might be both an entrepreneur and a manager. Managers “were more inclined to avoid challenges,
innovations and what Schumpeter called the ‘perennial torment of creative destruction’ in favour of a more
tranquil life” (Zaratiegui & Rabade, 2005, p. 781). The main risks they faced from firm failure were to their

9 • LEE A. SWANSON

reputations or to their employment status. Managers had little incentive to strive to maximize profits (Zaratiegui
& Rabade, 2005).
Amasa Walker (1799-1875) and his son Francis Walker (1840-1897) were from the American School of thought,
and they helped shape an American perspective of entrepreneurship following the Civil War of 1861-1865. These
scholars claimed that entrepreneurs created wealth, and thus played a different role than capitalists. They believed
that entrepreneurs had the power of foresight and leadership qualities that enabled them to organize resources and
inject energy into activities that create wealth (Chell, 2008).
Entrepreneurship versus Entrepreneur
Adam Smith (1723-1790), from the English School of thought, published An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
of the Wealth of Nations in 1776. In a departure from the previous thought into entrepreneurship and economics,
Smith did not dwell on a particular class of individual. He was concerned with studying how all people fit into the
economic system. Smith contended that the economy was driven by self-interest in the marketplace (Chell, 2008).
Also from the English School, David Ricardo (1772-1823) was influenced by Smith, Say, and others. His work
focused on how the capitalist system worked. He explained how manufacturers must invest their capital in
response to the demand for the products they produce. If demand decreases, manufacturers should borrow less
and reduce their workforces. When demand is high, they should do the reverse (Chell, 2008).
Carl Menger (1840-1921), from the Austrian School of thought, ranked goods according to their causal
connections to human satisfaction. Lower order goods include items like bread that directly satisfy a human want
or need like hunger. Higher order goods are those more removed from satisfying a human need. A second order
good is the flour that was used to make the bread. The grain used to make the flour is an even higher order good.
Entrepreneurs coordinate these factors of production to turn higher order goods into lower order goods that more
directly satisfy human wants and needs (Hebert & Link, 2009).
Menger (1950 [1871], p. 160) established that entrepreneurial activity includes: (a) obtaining
information about the economic situation, (b) economic calculation – all the various computations
that must be made if a production process is to be efficient, (c) the act of will by which goods of
higher order are assigned to a particular production process, and (d) supervising the execution of
the production plan so that it may be carried through as economically as possible (Hebert & Link,
2009, p. 43).
Entrepreneurship and Innovation
Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), from the English School of thought, considered entrepreneurs to be innovators.
They “depart from routine, discover new markets, find new sources of supply, improve existing products and
lower the costs of production” (Chell, 2008).
Joseph Schumpeter’s (1883-1950) parents were Austrian, he studied at the University of Vienna, conducted
research at the University of Graz, served as Austria’s Minister of Finance, and was the president of a bank in the

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 10

country. Because of the rise of Hitler in Europe, he went to the United States and conducted research at Harvard
until he retired in 1949. Because of this, he is sometimes associated with the American School of thought on
entrepreneurship (Chell, 2008).
Whereas Menger saw entrepreneurship as occurring because of economic progress, Schumpeter took the opposite
stance. Schumpeter saw economic activity as leading to economic development (Hebert & Link, 2009).
Entrepreneurs play a central role in Schumpeter’s theory of economic development, and economic development
can occur when the factors of production are assembled in new combinations.
Schumpeter (1934) viewed innovation as arising from new combinations of materials and forces. He provided the
following five cases of new combinations.
1. The introduction of a new good – that is one with which consumers are not yet familiar – or of a new
quality of good.
2. The introduction of a new method of production, that is one not yet tested by experience in the branch
of manufacture concerned, which need by no means be founded upon a discovery scientifically new,
and can also exist in a new way of handling a commodity commercially.
3. The opening of a new market, that is a market into which the particular branch of manufacture of the
country in question has not previously entered, whether or not this market has existed before.
4. The conquest of a new source of supply of raw materials or half-manufactured goods, again
irrespective of whether this source already exists or whether it has first to be created.
5. The carrying out of the new organisation of any industry, like the creation of a monopoly position …
or the breaking up of a monopoly position (Schumpeter, 1934, p. 66).
Another concept popularized by Schumpeter – in addition to the notion of new combinations – was creative
destruction. This was meant to indicate that the existing ways of doing things need to be dismantled – to be
destroyed – to enable a transformation through innovation to a new way of doing things. Entrepreneurs use
innovation to disrupt how things are done and to establish a better way of doing those things.

Basic Questions in Entrepreneurship Research
According to Baron (2004a), there are three basic questions of interest in the field of entrepreneurship:
1. Why do some persons but not others choose to become entrepreneurs?
2. Why do some persons but not others recognize opportunities for new products or services that can be
profitably exploited?
3. Why are some entrepreneurs so much more successful than others (Baron, 2004a, p. 221)?
To understand where these foundational research questions came from and what their relevance is today, it is
useful to study what entrepreneurship research has uncovered so far.

11 • LEE A. SWANSON

Entrepreneurial Uniqueness
Efforts to teach entrepreneurship have included descriptions of entrepreneurial uniqueness based on personality,
behavioural, and cognitive traits (Chell, 2008; Duening, 2010).
• Personality characteristics
◦ Three personality characteristics of entrepreneurs that are often cited are:
▪ Need for achievement
▪ Internal locus of control (a belief by an individual that they are in control of their
own destiny)
▪ Risk-taking propensity
• Behavioural traits
• Cognitive skills of successful entrepreneurs
Past studies of personality characteristics and behavioural traits have not been overly successful at identifying
entrepreneurial uniqueness.
As it turned out, years of painstaking research along this line has not borne significant fruit.
It appears that there are simply not any personality characteristics that are either essential
to, or defining of, entrepreneurs that differ systematically from non-entrepreneurs…. Again,
investigators proposed a number of behavioural candidates as emblematic of entrepreneurs.
Unfortunately, this line of research also resulted in a series of dead ends as examples of successful
entrepreneurial behaviours had equal counterparts among samples of non-entrepreneurs. As with
the personality characteristic school of thought before it, the behavioural trait school of thought
became increasingly difficult to support (Duening, 2010, p. 4-5).
This shed doubt on the value of trying to change personality characteristics or implant new entrepreneurial
behaviours through educational programs in an effort to promote entrepreneurship.
New research, however, has resurrected the idea that there might be some value in revisiting personality traits
as a topic of study. Additionally, Duening (2010) and has suggested that an important approach to teaching and
learning about entrepreneurship is to focus on the “cognitive skills that successful entrepreneurs seem uniquely to
possess and deploy” (p. 2). In the next sections we consider the new research on entrepreneurial personality traits
and on entrepreneurial cognitions.

Entrepreneurial Personality Traits
While acknowledging that research had yet to validate the value of considering personality and behaviour traits
as ways to distinguish entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs or unsuccessful ones, Chell (2008) suggested that
researchers turn their attention to new sets of traits including: “the proactive personality, entrepreneurial self-

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 12

efficacy, perseverance and intuitive decision-making style. Other traits that require further work include social
competence and the need for independence” (p. 140).
In more recent years scholars have considered how the Big Five personality traits – extraversion, agreeableness,
conscientiousness, neuroticism (sometimes presented as emotional stability), and openness to experience
(sometimes referred to as intellect) – might be used to better understand entrepreneurs. It appears that the Big
Five traits might be of some use in predicting entrepreneurial success. Research is ongoing in this area, but
in one example, Caliendo, Fossen, and Kritikos (2014) studied whether personality constructs might “influence
entrepreneurial decisions at different points in time” (p. 807), and found that “high values in three factors of
the Big Five approach—openness to experience, extraversion, and emotional stability (the latter only when we
do not control for further personality characteristics)—increase the probability of entry into self-employment”
(p. 807). They also found “that some specific personality characteristics, namely risk tolerance, locus of control,
and trust, have strong partial effects on the entry decision” (p. 807). They also found that people who scored
higher on agreeableness were more likely to exit their businesses, possibly meaning that people with lower
agreeableness scores might prevail longer as entrepreneurs. When it came to specific personality traits, their
conclusions indicated that those with an external locus of control were more likely to stop being self-employed
after they had run their businesses for a while. There are several implications for research like this, including the
potential to better understand why some entrepreneurs behave as they do based upon their personality types and
the chance to improve entrepreneurship education and support services.

Entrepreneurial Cognitions
It is only fairly recently that entrepreneurship scholars have focused on cognitive skills as a primary factor that
differentiates successful entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs and less successful entrepreneurs. This approach
deals with how entrepreneurs think differently than non-entrepreneurs (Duening, 2010; Mitchell et al., 2007).
Entrepreneurial cognitions are the knowledge structures that people use to make assessments,
judgments or decisions involving opportunity evaluation and venture creation and growth. In
other words, research in entrepreneurial cognition is about understanding how entrepreneurs use
simplifying mental models to piece together previously unconnected information that helps them
to identify and invent new products or services, and to assemble the necessary resources to start
and grow businesses (Mitchell, Busenitz, et al., 2002, p. 97).
Mitchell, Smith, et al. (2002) provided the example of how the decision to create a new venture (dependent
variable) was influenced by three sets of cognitions (independent variables). They described these cognitions as
follows:
Arrangements cognitions are the mental maps about the contacts, relationships, resources, and
assets necessary to engage in entrepreneurial activity; willingness cognitions are the mental maps
that support commitment to venturing and receptivity to the idea of starting a venture; ability
cognitions consist of the knowledge structures or scripts (Glaser, 1984) that individuals have to
support the capabilities, skills, norms, and attitudes required to create a venture (Mitchell et al.,

13 • LEE A. SWANSON

2000). These variables draw on the idea that cognitions are structured in the minds of individuals
(Read, 1987), and that these knowledge structures act as “scripts” that are the antecedents of
decision making (Leddo & Abelson, 1986, p. 121; Mitchell, Smith, et al., 2002, p. 10)
Cognitive Perspective to Understanding Entrepreneurship
According to Baron (2004a), by taking a cognitive perspective, we might better understand entrepreneurs and the
role they play in the entrepreneurial process.
The cognitive perspective emphasizes the fact that everything we think, say, or do is influenced
by mental processes—the cognitive mechanisms through which we acquire store, transform, and
use information. It is suggested here that this perspective can be highly useful to the field of
entrepreneurship. Specifically, it can assist the field in answering three basic questions it has long
addressed: (1) Why do some persons but not others choose to become entrepreneurs? (2) Why
do some persons but not others recognize opportunities for new products or services that can be
profitably exploited? And (3) Why are some entrepreneurs so much more successful than others
(Baron, 2004a, p. 221-222)?
Baron (2004a), illustrated how cognitive differences between people might explain why some people end up
pursuing entrepreneurial pursuits and others do not. For example, prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1977)
and other decision-making or behavioural theories might be useful in this regard. Research into cognitive biases
might also help explain why some people become entrepreneurs.
Baron (2004a) also revealed ways in which cognitive concepts like signal detection theory, regulation theory, and
entrepreneurial might help explain why some people are better at entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. He also
illustrated how some cognitive models and theories – like risk perception, counterfactual thinking, processing
style, and susceptibility to cognitive errors – might help explain why some entrepreneurs are more successful than
others.
Cognitive Perspective and the Three Questions
• Why do some and not others choose to become entrepreneurs?
◦ Prospect Theory
◦ Cognitive Biases
• Why are some people better at recognizing entrepreneurial opportunities?
◦ Signal Detection Theory
◦ Regulation Theory
◦ Entrepreneurial Alertness
• Why are some people more successful at entrepreneurship than others?
◦ Risk Perception

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 14

◦ Counterfactual Thinking
◦ Processing Style
◦ Susceptibility to Cognitive Errors

Entrepreneurial Scripts
• Why do some people, or groups of people, achieve high performance economic results while others do
not? Is there a relationship between the attainment of high performance economic results and
transaction cognitions (a type of economic thought pattern)?
◦ “Cognition has emerged as an important theoretical perspective for understanding and
explaining human behavior and action” (Dutta & Thornhill, 2008, p. 309).
◦ Cognitions are all processes by which sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated,
stored, recovered, and used (Neisser, 1976).
◦ Cognitions lead to the acquisition of knowledge, and involve human information processing.
• Knowledge structure/script:
◦ Is a mental model, or information processing short-cut that can give information form and
meaning, and enable subsequent interpretation and action.
◦ The subsequent interpretation and actions can result in expert performance … they can also
result in thinking errors.
• Entrepreneurial scripting exercises are critical to giving learners an explicit understanding of:
◦ the processes that transfer expertise, and
◦ the actual expertise itself.
• The structure of scripts (based upon Mitchell (2000)
◦ Scripts are generally framed as a linear sequence of steps, usually with feedback loops, that
can explain how to achieve a particular task – perhaps like developing a business plan.
◦ Sometimes scripts can be embedded within other scripts. For example, within a general
venturing script that outlines the sequences of activities that can lead to a successful business
launch, there will probably be sub-scripts describing how entrepreneurs can search for ideas,
screen those ideas until one is selected, plan how to launch a sustainable business based upon
that idea and including securing the needed financial resources, setting up the business,
starting it, effectively managing its ongoing operations, and managing the venture such that
that entrepreneur can extract the value that they desire from the enterprise at the times and in
the ways they want it.
◦ The most effective scripts include an indication of the norms that outline performance
standards and indicate how to determine when any step in the sequence has been properly

completed.

General Venturing Script
Generally, entrepreneurship is considered to consist of the following elements, or subscripts (Brooks, 2009;
Mitchell, 2000).
• Searching
• Idea Screening
• Planning and Financing
• Set-Up
• Start-Up
• Ongoing Operations
• Harvest
Searching (also called idea formulation or opportunity recognition)
• This script begins when a person decides they might be a potential entrepreneur (or when an existing
entrepreneur decides they need more ideas in their idea pool).
• This script ends when there are a sufficient number of ideas in the idea pool.
• The scripting process involves a logical flow of steps (including feedback loops, actions which must
occur in sequence, and actions which can be implemented at the same time as other actions) designed
to:
◦ overcome mental blockages to creativity which might hinder this person’s ability to identify
viable ideas;
◦ implement steps to identify a sufficient number of ideas (most likely 5 or more) which the
person is interested in investigating to determine whether they might be viable given general
criteria such as this person’s personal interests and capabilities;
Idea Screening (also called concept development)
• This script begins when the person with the idea pool is no longer focusing on adding new ideas to it;
but is instead taking steps to choose the best idea for them given a full range of specific criteria.
• This script ends when one idea is chosen from among those in the idea pool.
• The scripting process involves a logical flow of steps to assess the current situation and the trends in
the following areas. The right tools must be used for each level of analysis.
◦ Do the current societal-level factors indicate that a particular idea should be considered for

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 16

implementation? Do the trends in these societal-level factors indicate that the idea will be
viable and sustainable into the future?
▪ Evaluate the political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal
climates
◦ Do the current industry/market-level factors indicate an idea is viable? Are the trends in
these factors supportive of the idea?
▪ Evaluate the degree of competitiveness in the industry, the threat of substitutes
emerging, the threat of new entrants to the industry, the degree of bargaining
power of buyers, and the degree of bargaining power of suppliers.
▪ Do a market profile analysis to assess the attractiveness of the position within the
industry that the potential venture will occupy.
◦ Do the current firm-level factors support the pursuit of the idea?
▪ Formulate and evaluate potential strategies to leverage organizational strengths,
overcome/minimize weaknesses, take advantage of opportunities, and overcome/
minimize threats;
▪ Complete financial projections and analyze them to evaluate financial
attractiveness;
▪ Assess the founder fit with the ideas;
▪ Evaluate the core competencies of the organization relative to the idea;
▪ Assess advice solicited from trusted advisers
Planning and Financing (also called resource determination and acquisition)
• This script begins when the idea screening script ends and when the person begins making the plans to
implement the single idea chosen from the idea pool, which is done in concert with securing financing
to implement the venture idea.
• This script ends when sufficient business planning has been done and when adequate financing has
been arranged.
• The scripting process involves a logical flow of steps to develop a business plan and secure adequate
financing to start the business.
Set-Up (also called launch)
• This script begins when the planning and financing script ends and when the person begins
implementing the plans needed to start the business.
• This script ends when the business is ready to start-up.

17 • LEE A. SWANSON

• The scripting process involves a logical flow of steps, including purchasing and installing equipment,
securing the venture location and finishing all the needed renovations, recruiting and hiring any staff
needed for start-up, and the many other steps needed to prepare for start-up.
• Start-Up (also called launch)
• This script begins when the set-up script ends and when the business opens and begins making sales.
• This script ends when the business has moved beyond the point where the entrepreneur must
continually fight for the business’s survival and persistence. It ends when the entrepreneur can instead
shift emphasis toward business growth or maintaining the venture’s stability.
• The scripting process involves a logical flow of steps needed to establish a new venture.
Ongoing Operations (also called venture growth)
• This script begins when the start-up script ends and when the business has established persistence and
is implementing growth (or maintenance) strategies.
• This script ends when the entrepreneur chooses to harvest the value they generated with the venture.
• The scripting process involves a logical flow of steps needed to grow (or maintain) a venture.

Studying Entrepreneurship
The following quotations from two preeminent entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education researchers
indicate the growing interest in studies in this field.
Entrepreneurship has emerged over the last two decades as arguably the most potent economic force the
world has ever experienced. With that expansion has come a similar increase in the field of entrepreneurship
education. The recent growth and development in the curricula and programs devoted to entrepreneurship
and new-venture creation have been remarkable. The number of colleges and universities that offer courses
related to entrepreneurship has grown from a handful in the 1970s to over 1,600 in 2005 (Kuratko, 2005, p.
577).
Interest in entrepreneurship has heightened in recent years, especially in business schools. Much of this
interest is driven by student demand for courses in entrepreneurship, either because of genuine interest in
the subject, or because students see entrepreneurship education as a useful hedge given uncertain corporate
careers (Venkataraman, 1997, p. 119).
Approaches to Studying Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship is a discipline, which means an individual can learn about it, and about how to be an effective
entrepreneur. It is a myth that people are born entrepreneurs and that others cannot learn to become entrepreneurs
(Drucker, 1985). Kuratko (2005) asserted that the belief previously held by some that entrepreneurship cannot

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 18

be taught has been debunked, and the focus has shifted to what topics should be taught and how they should be
covered.
Solomon (2007) summarized some of the research on what should be covered in entrepreneurship courses,
and how it should be taught. While the initial focus was on actions like developing business plans and being
exposed to real entrepreneurs, more recently this approach has been supplemented by an emphasis on technical,
industry, and personal experience. “It requires critical thinking and ethical assessment and is based on the premise
that successful entrepreneurial activities are a function of human, venture and environmental conditions” (p.
172). Another approach “calls for courses to be structured around a series of strategic development challenges
including opportunity identification and feasibility analysis; new venture planning, financing and operating; new
market development and expansion strategies; and institutionalizing innovation” (p. 172). This involves having
students interact with entrepreneurs by interviewing them, having them act as mentors, and learning about their
experiences and approaches through class discussions.
Sources of Information for Studying Entrepreneurship
According to Kuratko (2005), “three major sources of information supply the data related to the entrepreneurial
process or perspective” (p. 579).
1. Publications (both research-based and those written for the general public)
a. Research-based publications:
i. Academic journals like Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, Journal of
Business Venturing, and Journal of Small Business Management
ii. Proceedings of conferences like Proceedings of the Academy of Management and
Proceedings of the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada
b. Publications written for practitioners and the general public
i. Textbooks on entrepreneurship
ii. Books about entrepreneurship
iii. Biographies or autobiographies of entrepreneurs
iv. News periodicals like Canadian Business and Profit
v. Trade periodicals like Entrepreneur and Family Business
vi. Government publications available through sources like the Enterprise
Saskatchewan and Canada-Saskatchewan Business Service Centre (CSBSC)
websites and through various government resource centers
2. Direct observation and interaction with practicing entrepreneurs
a. Data might be collected from entrepreneurs and about entrepreneurs through surveys,
interviews, or other methods applied by researchers.
3. Speeches and presentations by practicing entrepreneurs

Chapter 2 – Opportunity Recognition and Design
Thinking

Entrepreneurs see ways to put resources and information together in new combinations. They not only see
the system as it is, but as it might be. They have a knack for looking at the usual and seeing the unusual, at
the ordinary and seeing the extraordinary. Consequently, they can spot opportunities that turn the
commonplace into the unique and unexpected. – Mitton (1989, p. 12)
In my opinion, all previous advances in the various lines of invention will appear totally insignificant when
compared with those which the present century will witness. I almost wish that I might live my life over
again to see the wonders which are at the threshold. – Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of
Patents, 1898-1901 (who has been incorrectly quoted as having said “Everything that can be invented has
been invented”)
The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created
them. – Albert Einstein
I think there is a world market for maybe five computers. – Thomas Watson, Chairman of IBM, 1943

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter you will be able to
• Discuss opportunity recognition concepts and methods as developed and/or advocated by
leading thinkers like Drucker, Mitchell, Schumpeter, and Vesper
• Describe what design thinking is
• Apply design thinking to develop and assess new venture ideas

21 • LEE A. SWANSON

Overview
This chapter introduces a sample of perspectives and tools designed to help individuals recognize potential
business opportunities. The concept of design thinking is also examined in some detail.
The objective is to help you improve your ability to apply inspiration, ideation, and implementation as part of the
design thinking process.

Opportunity Recognition
The following is a discussion of entrepreneurship theorists and practitioners who have developed the concept of
opportunity recognition. While the tools introduced in the next sections can be applied for a variety of purposes,
they are particularly useful for recognizing new venture opportunities.
Baron
Opportunity recognition is
the active, cognitive process (or processes) through which individuals conclude that they have
identified the potential to create something new that has the potential to generate economic
value and that is not currently being exploited or developed, and is viewed as desirable in the
society in which it occurs (i.e. its development is consistent with existing legal and moral
conditions). (Baron, 2004b, p. 52)
Because opportunity recognition is a cognitive process, according to Baron (2004b), people can learn to be more
effective at recognizing opportunities by changing the way they think about opportunities and how to recognize
them.
Drucker
Systematic innovation involves “monitoring seven sources for innovative opportunity” (Drucker, 1985, p. 35).
The first four are internally focused within the business or industry, in that they may be visible to those involved
in that organization or sector. The last three involve changes outside the business or industry.
• Internally Focused
◦ The unexpected (unexpected success, failure, or outside events)
◦ The incongruity between reality as it actually is and reality as it is assumed to be or as it
ought to be
◦ Innovation based on process need
◦ Changes in industry structure or market structure that catch everyone unawares
• Externally Focused

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 22

◦ Demographics (population changes)
◦ Changes in perception, mood, and meaning
◦ New knowledge, both scientific and nonscientific
Mitchell
One of the components of Mitchell’s (2000) New Venture TemplateTM asks whether the venture being examined
represents a new combination. To determine this, he suggests considering two categories of entrepreneurial
discovery: scientific discovery and circumstance.
• Scientific Discovery
◦ Physical/technological insight
◦ New and valuable way
• Circumstantial Discovery
◦ Specific knowledge of time, place, or circumstance
◦ When and what you know
The second set of variables to consider are the market imperfections that can create profit opportunities: excess
demand and excess supply. This gives rise to the following four types of entrepreneurial discovery.
• Invention I
◦ Uses science to exploit excess demand (a market imperfection)
◦ Becomes an opportunity to discover and apply the laws of nature to satisfy excess demand
◦ Inventions in one industry have ripple effects in others
◦ Example: invention of airplane
• Observation
◦ Circumstances reveal opportunity to exploit excess demand (a market imperfection)
◦ Not necessarily science-oriented
◦ Example: airline industry = need for food service for passengers
• Invention II
◦ Uses science to exploit excess supply (a market imperfection)
◦ Example: Second most abundant element on earth after oxygen = silicon microchips
• Coordination
◦ Circumstances reveals opportunity to exploit excess supply (a market imperfection)
◦ Example: Producer’s capacities to lower prices = Wal-Mart

23 • LEE A. SWANSON

Schumpeter
Schumpeter’s (1934) five kinds of new combinations (see page 13) can occur within each of the four kinds of
entrepreneurial discovery (Mitchell, 2000):
• New or improved good/service
◦ Distinction between true advances and promotional differences
• New method of production
◦ Example: assembly line method to automobile production, robotics, agricultural processing
• Opening of a new market
◦ Global context: Culture, laws, local buyer preferences, business practices, customs,
communication, transportation all set up new distribution channels
◦ Example: Honda created a new market for smaller modestly powered motorbikes
• Conquest of a new source of supply of raw materials
◦ Enhance availability of products by providing at lower cost
◦ Enhance availability by making more available without compromising quality
• Reorganization of an industry
Murphy
Murphy (2011) claimed that there was a single-dimensional logic that oversimplified the approach taken to
understand entrepreneurial discovery. He was bothered by the notion that entrepreneurs either deliberately
searched for entrepreneurial opportunities or they serendipitously discovered them. Murphy’s (2011)
multidimensional model of entrepreneurial discovery suggests that opportunities may be identified (a) through a
purposeful search; (b) because others provide the opportunity to the entrepreneur; (c) through prior knowledge,
entrepreneurial alertness, and means other than a purposeful search; and, (d) through a combination of lucky
happenstance and deliberate searching for opportunities.
Vesper
According to experimentation research, entrepreneurial creativity is not correlated with IQ
(people with high IQs can be unsuccessful in business and those with lower IQs can be successful
as an entrepreneur). Research has also shown that those who practice idea generation techniques
can become more creative. The best ideas sometimes come later in the idea-generation
process—often in the days and weeks following the application of the idea-generating processes
(Vesper, 1996).
Vesper (1996) identified several ways in which entrepreneurs found ideas:
• Prior job

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 24

• Recreation
• Chance event
• Answering discovery questions
Although would-be entrepreneurs usually don’t discover ideas by a deliberate searching strategy
(except when pursuing acquisitions of ongoing firms), it is nevertheless possible to impute to
their discoveries some implicit searching patterns. (Vesper, 1996, p. 60)
Vesper (1996) categorized discovery questions as follows:
• Search questions, which might prompt venture ideas by placing one’s mind into a mode where the
subconscious will work to push ideas into the conscious mind
◦ What is bothering me and what might relieve that bother?
◦ How could this be made or done differently that it is now?
◦ What else might I like to have?
◦ How can I fall the family tradition?
• Questions based on encounters with a potential customer request, someone else’s idea, or another
event
◦ Can I play some role in providing this product or service to a broader market?
◦ Could there be a way to do this better for the customer?
• Questions based on evaluative reactions to ideas
◦ Could I do this job on my own instead of as an employee?
◦ If people elsewhere went for this idea, might they want it here too?
Vesper (1996) also highlighted several mental blocks to departure. He suggested that generating innovative ideas
involved two tasks: to depart from what is usual or customary and to apply an effective way to direct this
departure. The mental blocks in the way of departure include the following:
• Perceptual blocks
◦ difficulty viewing things from different perspectives
◦ seeing only what you expect to see or think what others expect you to see
• Emotional blocks
◦ intolerance of ambiguity
◦ preference for judging rather than seeking ideas
◦ tunnel vision
◦ insufficient patience

25 • LEE A. SWANSON

• Cultural blocks
◦ a belief that reason and logic are superior to feeling, intuition, and other such approaches
◦ thinking that tradition is preferable to change
◦ disdain for fantasy, reflection, idea playfulness, humor
• Imagination blocks
◦ fear of subconscious thinking
◦ inhibition about some areas of imagination
• Environmental blocks
◦ distrust of others who might be able to help
◦ distractions
◦ discouraging responses from other people
• Intellectual blocks
◦ lack of information
◦ incorrect information
◦ weak technical skills in areas such as financial analysis
• Expressive blocks
◦ poor writing skills
◦ inability to construct prototypes
Understanding these mental blocks to departure is a first step in figuring out how to cope with them. Some tactics
for departure include the following (Vesper, 1996):
• Trying different ways of looking at and thinking about venture opportunities
• Trying to continually generate ideas about opportunities and how to exploit them
• Seeking clues from business and personal contacts, trade shows, technology licensing offices, and
other sources
• Not being discouraged by others’ negative views because many successful innovations were first
thought to be impossible to make
• Generating possible solutions to obstacles before stating negative views about them
• Using idea generating tricks like
◦ Brainstorming
◦ Considering multiple consequences of possible future events or changes
◦ Rearranging, reversing, expanding, shrinking, combining, or altering ideas

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 26

◦ Developing scenarios

Design Thinking
Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to
integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success – Tim
Brown, president and CEO (IDEO, 2015, para. 5)

The Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, called the d.school (http://dschool.stanford.edu/),
is an acknowledged leader at promoting design thinking. You can download the Bootcamp Bootleg manual from
the d.school website at https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/the-bootcamp-bootleg. The following description of
design thinking is from the IDEO website:
Design thinking is a deeply human process that taps into abilities we all have but get overlooked
by more conventional problem-solving practices. It relies on our ability to be intuitive, to
recognize patterns, to construct ideas that are emotionally meaningful as well as functional, and to
express ourselves through means beyond words or symbols. Nobody wants to run an organization
on feeling, intuition, and inspiration, but an over-reliance on the rational and the analytical can be
just as risky. Design thinking provides an integrated third way.
The design thinking process is best thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than
a sequence of orderly steps. There are three spaces to keep in mind: inspiration, ideation, and
implementation. Inspiration is the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions.
Ideation is the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas. Implementation is the path
that leads from the project stage into people’s lives (IDEO, 2015, para. 7-8).

Chapter 3 – Evaluating Entrepreneurial
Opportunities

Since idea generation and screening are relatively less costly stages in the new product development
process (in terms of investment in funds, time, personnel, and escalation of commitment), it makes sense to
manage the process in the most efficient and effective manner for the organization. – Rochford (1991, p.
287)
The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The truly dangerous thing is
asking the wrong question. – Peter Drucker
I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts
to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. – Arthur Conan Doyle

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter you will be able to
• Apply analytical skills to assess how the nature of entrepreneurial environment can influence
entrepreneurial outcomes
• Apply the right tools to analyze each of the societal, industry, market, and firm levels to
evaluate entrepreneurial and other business opportunities

Overview
This chapter introduces the idea that there are different types of economies while providing examples of ways to
consider how economies can differ. It also introduces the distinct levels of analyses that must be considered while
stressing the importance of applying the appropriate tools to conduct the analyses at each level.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 28

Types of Economies
When studying entrepreneurship, it is important to understand the foundations upon which the area of study
stands. One way to do this is to consider perspectives on different kinds of economies. In the next sections we
will consider two such perspectives. The first describes the idea of the bazaar, firm, and new economies, and the
second examines the idea of the sharing economy.
Bazaar, Firm, and New Economies
Entrepreneurship has existed as long as individuals have specialized in the production of a good or service to
exchange with other individuals for products they needed, but did not produce themselves. Dana, Etemad, and
Wright (2008) distinguished between bazaar-type economies, firm-type economies, and the new economy.
The Bazaar-Type Economy
The Bazaar-type Economy is a social, cultural and economic system in which the physical
clustering of vendors facilitates the consumer’s comparative information search, by eliminating
displacement time. Business is strongly affected by relationships and networks; relationships and
preferential treatment are integral to business. Consumers are not treated equally. Different people
pay unlike prices. The price paid and the level of service provided is a function of status and
relationships. Products and services are personalised, and this leads to customer loyalty. (Dana et
al., 2008, p. 110-111)
Bazaars have been around for thousands of years and, as Dana et al. (2008) note, have several distinctive features:
• It is a way of life, a cultural and social system.
• Although it is a mode for commercial activity, relationships and alliances are the focus of the activities,
not the financial transactions.
• The lowest price and the best quality are less important to purchasers because they often consider the
vendor as a friend they wish to help and someone who will help them in return.
• Buyers and sellers seek to maintain long-term relationships with each other; there is little or no
concern with maximizing profits.
• Vendors do not consider other vendors to be rivals and there is little interest or advantage in
differentiating the products offered from those sold by others.
• Prices are established through negotiation, with buyers often making the first offer of a price.
Competitive tensions are between buyers and sellers rather than between sellers.
• Once relationships are established (which reduces transaction costs), both buyers and sellers tend to
have high degrees of satisfaction with the transactions.

29 • LEE A. SWANSON

The Firm-Type Economy
The Firm-type Economy is an economic institution in which location is a competitive advantage.
In the shopping mall, for instance, an exclusivity clause protects the vendor, limiting competition.
The consumer’s comparative information search involves displacement time, and an opportunity
cost is involved when seeking perfect information. Business takes place primarily within a set
of impersonally defined institutions. The flow of commerce is a function of strategy based on
optimisation models. The purpose of transactions is to maximise wealth efficiently, and the means
to this is rational and unbiased decision-making that treats buyers as equals. The price paid and
the level of service provided is established by the seller. Products and services are standardised,
and this leads to efficiency that in turn allows competitive pricing. (Dana et al., 2008, p. 111)
In Canada, we are more familiar with the firm-type economy. Dana et al. (2008) highlighted the following
differences between it and the bazaar.
• Firm-consumer transactions are impersonal. The focus is on the interaction between the buyer and the
product rather than between the buyer and seller. Product attributes are considered to be important.
Relationships between buyers and sellers are trivial and secondary as compared to the transaction
itself.
• Firms engage in transactions while attempting to maximize profits through rational decision-making.
• Competition is between sellers who attempt to segment the market based on types of consumers.
• Sellers generally set prices consumers are expected to accept and pay.
• The premise is that firms treat all customers equally.
The New Economy
The New Economy is a cultural and economic system in which the virtual clustering of vendors
facilitates the consumer’s comparative information search, by eliminating displacement time.
The flow of commerce is strongly affected by relationships and networks; relationships and
preferential treatment are integral to business. Consumers are not treated equally. Different people
pay unlike prices. The price paid and the level of service provided is a function of status and
relationships. Products and services are customized. (Dana et al., 2008, p. 111)
Dana et al. (2008) have observed the following norms they claim are currently in place or are developing:
• Firms no longer treat all consumers equally. Some customers receive special promotional offers,
preferential treatment, and other benefits over other customers.
• Differentiation is less evident than it used to be.
• The focus has shifted (back) toward establishing relationships with consumers. Different prices are
charged depending upon the nature of the relationship the firm has with the customer.
• There is now less competition than before with former rivals now cooperating through networks and

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 30

global alliances.
• The internet has become a medium through which transactions occur, reducing searching costs for
consumers and, in some cases, inventory handling and production costs for firms. In some cases,
consumers suggest the starting price in a negotiation process.
• In many ways, this new “reality is shared with the Bazaar-type Economy—a social and cultural
system, a way of life and a general mode of commercial activity such that most of the flow of
commerce is centred on relationships” (Dana et al., 2008, p. 115).
The Sharing Economy – Collaborative Consumption
One trend that has become more prominent of late, perhaps because new information technologies have enabled
new developments in this area, involves individuals and businesses seeking new ways to share underutilized
resources and develop new business models that focus on selling the use of something rather than selling the item
itself. This arises from the desire to generate value from items that are not being used to their full potential by their
owners: “Instead of buying and owning products, consumers are increasingly interested in leasing and sharing
them. Companies can benefit from the trend toward ‘collaborative consumption’ through creative new approaches
to defining and distributing their offerings” (Matzler, Veider, & Kathan, 2015).
For instance, when people have space available in their houses and wish to generate revenue from that unused
or underused area, they can use Airbnb Inc. (https://www.airbnb.com/) to rent rooms. The Airbnb business model
is interesting in that it facilitates the rental of spaces that it does not own. The service essentially created a new
supply of accommodations for travelers in addition to the traditional hotel, motel, and bed and breakfast providers.
Uber (https://uber.com) provides people who have both a vehicle and available time with the opportunity to turn
those resources into revenue by providing rides to people who need them.
Saskatoon CarShare Co-operative (http://saskatooncarshare.com/) purchases cars that its members can book
online at any time. It attracts people who only need vehicles occasionally, like when they have to get groceries or
run other errands:
It’s a win for you because you save money by not having to own a car.
Being a CarShare member helps you save money. A typical car-owner spends an average of $6,400 per
year. That comes out to about $533 per month or $17.64/day to maintain and operate an efficient vehicle
(e.g. Honda Civic). By making simple changes to integrate walking, biking, busing and CarSharing into
your traveling habits you can save some serious cash. That means you can invest your money in other
things, even a down payment for a home!
It is a win for the environment, the city of Saskatoon and your community.
For every CarShare vehicle out there, another five cars are taken off the road. That means fewer vehicles
need to be driven, fuelled and maintained. Besides, less vehicles on the road also means less traffic on our
streets. Now there’s something City Hall can get behind! (Saskatoon CarShare Co-operative, 2015)

31 • LEE A. SWANSON

The transaction costs—in terms of money and time—used to be very high when someone who needed something
had to find a way to connect with someone else who could provide that something, and vice versa. Those
transaction costs have plummeted because of the internet, and entrepreneurs are developing new methods for
making unused or underused resources available to people who want them. This has formed the basis for the
sharing economy.
Matzler et al. (2015) identified six ways that companies could benefit by engaging in the sharing economy:
1. Sell the use of a product rather than ownership of it.
◦ For instance, Nova Rentals, tool and equipment rental company located in Mississauga,
Ontario, rents tool and equipment for construction, landscaping, renovations, and
contractors. Their customers range from large construction companies to small contractors,
service businesses, and homeowners. (NOVA Rentals, 2015).
2. Provide customers with the opportunity to resell products they purchased.
◦ Patagonia is an innovative outdoor apparel company operating under the mission to “build
the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement
solutions to the environmental crisis” (Patagonia, 2015a). Although counter intuitive for
many traditional business owners who strive to sell new or replacement products rather than
promote less consumption, the company runs a program to “make it easy to buy, sell or trade
Patagonia gear” (Patagonia, 2015b, Reuse & Recycle). They explicitly ask their customers to
use the tools that Patagonia makes available to “decrease the environmental impact of their
stuff over time by repairing it, finding ways to reuse it, recycling it when it’s truly ready. By
buying only what they need, customers can reduce their overall consumption in the long run”
(Patagonia, 2015b, para. 10). In the past, Patagonia has even partnered with companies like
eBay to encourage its customers to resell used Patagonia products rather than throw them out
(PR Newswire, 2011).
3. By exploiting unused resources and capacities
◦ Airbnb essentially takes advantage of unused space to generate revenues for homeowners.
An example of exploiting unused capabilities is when homeowners who generate more
energy than they need through solar, wind, and other means can sell the excess back to the
electricity companies.
4. By providing repair and maintenance services.
◦ Companies like Patagonia supply repair services or make it easy for customers to repair their
own apparel so that fewer new products need to be produced and less is thrown away.
5. By using collaborative consumption to target new customers.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 32

◦ Wolf Willow Cohousing organized in “January 2008 to explore the possibility of creating a
cohousing community in Saskatoon” (Smillie, 2015, para. 1). The idea was to attract a group
of like-minded older adults who would collectively develop—with the aid of project
manager, architect, and construction professionals—a unique condominium housing
initiative with self-contained living units and common spaces. In 2012, the 21-unit, fourlevel, environmentally-conscious, energy-efficient cohousing building located in a central
area of Saskatoon opened with unique in-door and outdoor common areas designed
specifically for the residents who were involved with designing the facility.
◦ The Canadian Cohousing Network (Network, 2015) provides a list of “architects,
developers, facilitators, development consultants, marketers, trainers, and others” (para. 1)
who can deliver services for groups wishing to develop cohousing projects.
6. By developing entirely new business models enabled by collaborative consumption
◦ New business models, including those supporting the businesses and business types listed
above, have emerged to take advantage of the current trend toward collaborative
consumption.

Levels of Analyses
When evaluating entrepreneurial opportunities—sometimes called idea screening—an effective process
involves assessing the various venture ideas being considered by applying different levels and types of analyses.
Entrepreneurs starting ventures and running existing businesses should also regularly analyze their operating
environments at the societal, industry, market, and firm-levels. The right tools, though, must be applied at each
level of analysis (see Figure 5). It is critical to complete an Essential Initial Research at all four levels (societal,
industry, market, and firm). The initial scan should be high-level, designed to assist in making key decisions (i.e.
determining if there is a viable market opportunity for the venture). Secondary scans should be continuously
conducted to support each part of the business plan (i.e. operations, marketing, finance). However, information
should only be included if it is research-based, relevant, and value-adding. The results from such research (i.e.
the Bank of Canada indicates that interest rates will be increasing in the next two years) should support business
strategies within the plan (i.e. debt financing may be less favourable than equity financing). Often, obtaining
support data (i.e. construction quotes) is not immediate, so plant a flag and move forward. Useful resources may
include information from Statistics Canada, Bank of Canada, IBIS World Report, etc.
Societal Level
At a societal level, it is important to understand each of the political, economic, social, technological,
environmental, and legal (PESTEL) factors—and, more specifically, the trends affecting those factors—that will
have an impact on a venture based on a particular idea. Some venture ideas might be screened-out and others
might be worth pursuing at a particular time because of the trends occurring with those PESTEL factors. Avoid

33 • LEE A. SWANSON

the use of technical jargon that may distract readers (i.e. rivalry among firms) and use simpler language (i.e.
competitive environment).
Industry Level
Apply Porter’s (1985) Five Forces Model, or a similar tool designed to assess industry-level factors. This analysis
will focus more specifically on the sector of the economy in which you intend to operate. Again, the right analysis
tool must be used for the assessment to be effective and avoid technical jargon (i.e. threat of new entrants) and
use simpler wording (i.e. difficulty of entering the market) or flip to an analysis of the threat (i.e. strategies to
establish and maintain market share).
Market Level
At the market level, use a tool to generate information about the part of the industry in which your business will
compete. This tool might be in the form of a set of questions designed to uncover information that you need to
know to help develop plans to improve the success of your proposed venture.
Firm Level
At a firm level, both the internal organizational trends and the external market profile trends should both be
analyzed. There are several tools for conducting an internal organizational analysis, and normally you should
normally apply several of them.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 34

Analyzing the Trends at Each Level

Figure 2 – Different Levels of Analysis (Illustration by Lee A. Swanson)

Analyze Societal-Level Trends
• Use an appropriate tool like the PESTEL model to assess both the current situation and the likely
changes as they may affect you.
◦ Political factors – federal & provincial & municipal government policy, nature of political

35 • LEE A. SWANSON

decisions, potential political changes, infrastructure plans, etc.
◦ Economic factors – interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates, tax rates, GDP growth,
health of the economy, etc.
◦ Social factors –population characteristics like age distribution and education levels, changes
in demand for types of products and services, etc.
◦ Technological factors – new processes, new products, infrastructure, etc.
◦ Environmental factors – effects of climate/weather, water availability, smog and pollution
issues, etc.
◦ Legal factors – labour laws, minimum wage rates, liability issues, etc.
• Assess the impact these trends have upon the venture:
◦ Do the trends uncover opportunities and threats?
◦ Can opportunities be capitalized on?
◦ Can problems be mitigated?
◦ Can the venture be sustained?
Analyze Industry-Level Trends
• Use an appropriate tool like the Five Forces Model (Porter, 1985) to analyze the industry in which you
expect to operate.
◦ Horizontal relationships – threat of substitutes, rivalry among existing competitors, threat of
new entrants
◦ Vertical Relationships – bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers
Analyze Market-Level Trends
• Use an appropriate method like a market profile analysis to assess the position within the industry in
which you expect to operate.
◦ Determine the answers to questions like the following:
▪ How attractive is the market?
▪ In what way are competitors expected to respond if you enter the market?
▪ What is the current size of the market and how large is it expected to be?
▪ What are the current and projected growth rates?
▪ At what stage of the development cycle is the market?
▪ What level of profits can be expected in the market?

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 36

▪ What proportion of the market can be captured? What will be the cost to capture
this proportion and what is the cost to capture the proportion required for business
sustainability?
Prior to a new business start-up, the customers that the new business wishes to attract either already purchase the
product or service from a competitor to the new business—or they do not yet purchase the product or service at
all. A new venture’s customers, therefore, must come from one of two sources: they must a) be attracted away
from existing (direct) competitors or b) be convinced to make different choices about where they spend their
money so they purchase the new venture’s product or service instead of spending their money in other ways (with
indirect competitors). An entrepreneur must decide from which source they will attract their customers, and how
they will do so. They must understand the competitive environment.
According to Porter (1996), strategy is about doing different things than competitors or doing similar things but
in different ways. To develop an effective strategy, an entrepreneur must understand the competition.
To understanding the competitive environment, entrepreneurs must do the following:
• determine who their current direct and indirect competitors are and who the future competitors will be
• understand the similarities and differences in quality, price, competitive advantages, and other factors
their proposed business and the existing competitors
• establish whether they can offer different products or services—or the same products or services in
different ways—to attract enough customers to meet their goals
• anticipate how the competitors will react in response to the new venture’s entry into the market
Analyze Firm-level Trends (organizational analysis)
There are several tools available for firm-level analysis, and usually several of them should be applied because
they serve different purposes.
• Use an appropriate tool like a SWOT Analysis/TOWS Matrix to formulate and evaluate potential
strategies to leverage organizational strengths, overcome/minimize weaknesses, take advantage of
opportunities, and overcome/minimize threats. You will also need to do a financial analysis and take
into account the founder fit and the competencies a venture should possess.
◦ SWOT analysis – identify organizational strengths and weaknesses and external
opportunities and threats
◦ TOWS matrix – develop strategies to:
▪ leverage strengths to take advantage of opportunities
▪ leverage strengths to overcome threats
▪ mitigate weaknesses by taking advantage of opportunities

37 • LEE A. SWANSON

▪ mitigate weaknesses while minimizing the potential threats or the potential
outcomes from threats
For analyzing a firm’s strategy, apply a VRIO Framework analysis.
• While conceptualizing the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, Barney (1997) and Barney and
Hesterly (2006) identified the following four considerations regarding resources and their ability to
help a firm gain a competitive advantage. Together, the following four questions make up the VRIO
Framework, which can help assess a firm’s capacity, determine what competencies a venture should
have, and determine whether competences are valuable, rare, inimitable, and exploitable.
◦ Value – Is a particular resource (financial, physical, technological, organizational, human,
reputational, innovative) valuable to a firm because it helps it take advantage of
opportunities or eliminate threats?
◦ Rarity – Is a particular resource rare in that it is controlled by or available to relatively few
others?
◦ Imitability – Is a particular resource difficult to imitate so that those who have it can retain
cost advantages over those who might try to obtain or duplicate it?
◦ Organization – Are the resources available to a firm useful to it because it is organized and
ready to exploit them?
Assess the financial attractiveness of the venture:
• Analyze similar firms in industry.
◦ Comparative ratio and financial analysis (see Vesper, 1996, p. 145-148) can help determine
industry norm returns, turnover ratios, working capital, operating efficiency, and other
measures of firm success.
• Project market share.
◦ Analyze the key industry players’ relative market share, and make judgments about how the
proposed venture would fare within the industry.
◦ Use information from market profile analysis and key industry player analysis.
• Analyze Expected Margins.
◦ Involves projecting expected margins from venture
◦ Useful information might come from financial analysis, market profile analysis, and NAICS
(North American Industry Classification System) codes (six digit codes used to identify an
industry—first five digits are standardized in Canada, the United States, and Mexico—is
gradually replacing the four digit SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) codes)
• Analyze break-even point.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 38

◦ Involves using information from margin analysis to determine break even volume and breakeven sales in dollars
◦ Is there sufficient volume to sustain the venture?
• Analyze Pro forma.
◦ Forecasting income and assets required to generate profits
• Analyze Sensitivity.
◦ What will be the likely impact if some assumed variable values change?
• Project Return on Investments (ROI).
◦ Projecting the ROI from undertaking the venture
◦ What is the opportunity cost of undertaking the venture?
Founder fit is an important consideration for entrepreneurs screening venture opportunities. While there are
plenty of examples of entrepreneurs successfully starting all types of businesses, “technical capability can be an
important if not all-important factor in pursuing ventures success” (Vesper, 1996, p. 149). Factors such as the
experience, training, credentials, reputation, and social capital an entrepreneur has can play an important role
in their success or failure in starting a new venture. Even when an entrepreneur can recruit expert help through
business partners or employees, they may also need to possess technical skills required in that particular kind of
business.
A common and useful way to help screen venture options is to seek input from experts, peers, mentors, business
associates, and perhaps other stakeholders like potential customers and direct family members.

Chapter 4 – Business Models

A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model. – Blank
and Dorf (2012, p. xvii)
Today countless innovative business models are emerging. Entirely new industries are forming as old
ones crumble. Upstarts are challenging the old guard, some of whom are struggling feverishly to reinvent
themselves.
How do you image your organization’s business model might look two, five, or ten years from now? Will you
be among the dominant players? Will you face competitors brandishing formidable new business models? –
Osterwalder, Pigneur, and Clark (2010, p. 4)

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter you will be able to
• Describe what a business model is
• Analyse existing and proposed businesses to determine what business models they are applying
and what business models they plan to apply
• Develop and analyze alternative business models for new entrepreneurial ventures

Overview
In this chapter, the concept of the business model is introduced. One concept of the business model in particular,
the Business Model Canvas, is explored as a way to conceptualize and categorize elements of a business model.

What are Business Models?
Magretta (2002) described business models as “stories that explain how enterprises work” (p. 87) and
Osterwalder, et al. (2010) said that they describe “the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 40

captures value” (p. 14). Chatterjee (2013) said that “A business is about selling what you make for a profit. A
business model is a configuration (activity systems) of what the business does (activities) and what it invests in
(resources) based on the logic that drives the profits for a specific business” (p. 97).

The Business Model Canvas
The Business Model Canvas tool is based on the premise that a start-up is something quite different than an
ongoing venture. A start-up should not be viewed as a smaller version of a company because starting-up a
company requires very different skills than operating one does. A start-up that is still a start-up after some
time—maybe after a couple of years for some kinds of start-ups—is actually a failed enterprise since it hasn’t
converted into an ongoing venture (Osterwalder et al., 2010).
The business model canvas is made up of nine parts that, together, end up describing the business model.

◦ How are we integrating them with customer routines?
◦ Channel phases:
▪ Awareness – How do we raise awareness about our company’s products and
services?
▪ Evaluation – How do we help customers evaluate our organization’s value
proposition?
▪ Purchase – How do we allow customers to purchase specific products and
services?
▪ Delivery – How do we deliver a value proposition to customers?
▪ After sales – How do we provide post-purchase customer support?
• Revenue streams
◦ For what value are our customers really willing to pay?
◦ For what do they currently pay?
◦ How are they currently paying?
◦ How would they prefer to pay?
◦ How much does each revenue stream contribute to overall revenues?
◦ Types: asset sale; usage fee; subscription fees; lending/renting/leasing; licensing; brokerage
fees; advertising
◦ Fixed pricing: list price; product feature dependent; customer segment dependent; volume

43 • LEE A. SWANSON

dependent
◦ Dynamic pricing: negotiation (bargaining); yield management; real-time-market
• Cost structure
◦ What are the most important costs inherent in our business model?
◦ Which key resources are most expensive?
◦ Which key activities are most expensive?
◦ Is your business more: cost driven (leanest cost structure, low price value proposition,
maximum automation, extensive outsourcing); value driven (focused on value creation,
premium value proposition).
◦ Sample characteristics: fixed costs (salaries, rents, utilities); variable costs; economies of
scale; economies of scope
The idea is to keep adding descriptions or plans to the nine components to create the initial business model and
then to actually do the start-up activities and replace the initial assumptions in each of the nine parts with newer
and better information or plans to let the business model evolve. This model is partly based on the idea that the
owner should be the one interacting with potential customers so he or she fully understands what these potential
customers want. These interactions should not only be done by hired sales people, at least until the business model
has evolved into one that works, which can only happen when the venture owner is completely engaged with the
potential customers and the other business operations (Osterwalder et al., 2010).
A business plan shouldn’t be created until the above has been done because you need to know what your business
model is before you can really create a business plan (Osterwalder et al., 2010). This seems to imply that the
Business Model Canvas is best suited to technology-based and other types of companies that can be basically
started and operated in some way that can later be converted into an ongoing venture. By starting operations and
making adjustments as you go, you are actually doing a form of market research that can be compiled into a full
business plan when one is needed.
According to Osterwalder, et al. (2010), the things we typically teach people in business school are geared
to helping people survive in larger, ongoing businesses. What is taught—including organizational structures,
reporting lines, managing sales teams, advertising, and similar topics—is not designed to help students understand
how a start-up works and how to deal with the volatile nature of new ventures. The Business Model Canvas idea
is meant to help us understand start-ups.
The Business Model Canvas tool is intended to be applied when business operations can be started on a small
scale and adjustments can continually be made until the evolving business model ends up working in real life.
This is in contrast to the more traditional approach of pre-planning everything and then going through the setup and start-up processes and ending up with a business venture that opens for business one day without having
proven at all that the business model it is founded upon will even work. These traditional start-ups sometimes
flounder along as the owners find that their plans are not quite working out and they try to make adjustments on
the fly. It can be difficult to make adjustments at this time because the processes are already set up. For example,

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 44

sales teams might be in the field trying to make sales and blaming the product developers for the difficulty they
are having, and the product developers might be blaming the sales teams for not being able to sell the product
properly. The real issue might be that the company simply isn’t meeting customers’ needs and they don’t have any
good mechanism for detecting and understanding and fixing this problem.
Lean Start-up
Consistent with the Business Model Canvas approach, Ries (2011) advanced the idea of the lean start-up. His
definition of a startup is “a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions
of extreme uncertainty” (p. 27), and the lean start-up approach involves releasing a minimal viable product
to customers with the expectation that this early prototype will change and evolve frequently and quickly in
response to customer feedback. This is meant to be a relatively easy and inexpensive way to develop a product or
service by relying on customer feedback to guide the pivots in new directions that will ultimately—and relatively
quickly—lead to a product or service that will have the appeal required for business success. It is only then that
the actual business can truly emerge.
Ries’s (2011) five lean start-up principles start with the idea that entrepreneurs are everywhere and that anyone
working in an environment where they seek to create new products or services “under conditions of extreme
uncertainty” (27) can use the lean start-up approach. Second, a start-up is more than the product or service; it
is an institution that must be managed in a new way that promotes growth through innovation. Third, startups
are about learning “how to build a sustainable business” (p. 8-9) by validating product or service design through
frequent prototyping that allows entrepreneurs to test the concepts. Forth, startups must follow this process or
feedback loop: create products and services; measure how the market reacts to them; and learn from that reaction
to determine whether to pivot or to persevere with an outcome the market accepts. Finally, Ries (2011) suggested
that entrepreneurial outcomes and innovation initiatives need to be measured through innovative accounting.

Growth Wheel
According to its website, GrowthWheel® (http://www.growthwheel.com/) is a decision-making tool for start-up
and growth companies to help business advisers and entrepreneurs focus, set agendas, make decisions, and take
action (GrowthWheel, 2015). It is effectively a more complex and detailed tool than the Business Model Canvas
for describing a business model. A web search will yield a variety of tools, like the Business Model Canvas and
the GrowthWheel®, that can be used to describe business models.

Franchises as Business Models
Franchises are basically business models developed by others (franchisors) that have been proven to work in
multiple contexts and that are sold to entrepreneurs (franchisees) who will implement the business model in
contexts that the franchisor believes will result in a successful enterprise. Franchises apply various business
models. Some are turnkey franchises, like McDonald’s, where the entire business structure is set up from the
design of the stores to the supply system, and the franchisor sets up virtually everything for the new franchisee.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 46

Other franchise models, like that defining Tap ‘N’ Pay Canada (http://www.tapnpay.ca/)—a business that provides
debit and credit card machines and point of sale equipment—advertise relatively low fees charged to franchisees
and quick set-ups in as little as two weeks (http://www.betheboss.ca/franchises/tap-n-pay).

Chapter 5 – Business Planning

Business planning is an important precursor to action in new ventures. By helping firm founders to make
decisions, to balance resource supply and demand, and to turn abstract goals into concrete operational steps,
business planning reduces the likelihood of venture disbanding and accelerates product development and
venture organizing activity. – Delmar and Shane (2003, p. 1165)
We always plan too much and always think too little. We resent a call to thinking and hate unfamiliar
argument that does not tally with what we already believe or would like to believe. – Joseph Schumpeter
Trying to predict the future is like trying to drive down a country road at night with no lights while looking
out the back window. – Peter Drucker

Overview
This chapter describes the purposes of business planning, the general concepts related to business planning, and
guidelines and a format for a comprehensive business plan.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 48

Business Planning Purposes
Business plans are developed for both internal and external purposes. Internally, entrepreneurs develop business
plans to help put the pieces of their business together. The most common external purpose for a business plan is
to raise capital.
Internal Purposes
• The business plan is the road map for the development of the business because it
◦ defines the vision for the company
◦ establishes the company’s strategy
◦ describes how the strategy will be implemented
◦ provides a framework for analysis of key issues
◦ provides a plan for the development of the business
◦ is a measurement and control tool
◦ helps the entrepreneur to be realistic and to put theories to the test
External Purposes
The business plan is often the main method of describing a company to external audiences such as potential
sources for financing and key personnel being recruited. It should assist outside parties to understand the current
status of the company, its opportunities, and its needs for resources such as capital and personnel. It also provides
the most complete source of information for valuation of the business.

Business Planning Principles
Business Plan Communication Principles
As Hindle and Mainprize (2006) note, business plan writers must strive to communicate their expectations about
the nature of an uncertain future. However, the liabilities of newness make communicating the expected future of
new ventures difficult (more so than for existing businesses). They outline five communications principles:
• Expectations
◦ Translation of your vision of the venture and how it will perform into a format compatible
with the expectations of the readers
◦ Communicate that
▪ you have identified and understood the key success factors and risks
▪ the projected market is large and you expect good market penetration

49 • LEE A. SWANSON

▪ you have a strategy for commercialization, profitability, and market domination
▪ you can establish and protect a proprietary and competitive position
• Milestones
◦ Anchoring key events in the plan with specific financial and quantitative values
◦ Communicate that
▪ your major plan objectives are in the form of financial targets
▪ you have addressed the dual need for planning and flexibility
▪ you understand the hazards of neglecting linkages between certain events
▪ you understand the importance of quantitative values (rather than just
chronological dates)
• Opportunities
◦ Nothing lasts forever—things can change to impact the opportunity: tastes, preferences,
technological innovation, competitive landscape
◦ Communicate these four aspects to distinguish the business concept, distinctive
competencies, and sustainable advantages:
▪ the new combination upon which venture is built
▪ magnitude of the opportunity or market size
▪ market growth trends
▪ venture’s value from the market (% of market share proposed or market share
value in dollars)
• Context
◦ Four key aspects describing context within which new venture is intended to function
(internal and external environment)
◦ Communicate
▪ how the context will help or hinder the proposal
▪ how the context may change & affect the business & the range of flexibility or
response that is built into the venture
▪ what management can or will do in the event the context turns unfavourable
▪ what management can do to affect the context in a positive way
• Business Model
◦ Brief and clear statement of how an idea actually becomes a business that creates value
◦ Communicate

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 50

▪ Who pays, how much, and how often?
▪ The activities the company must perform to produce its product, deliver it to its
customers and earn revenue
▪ And be able to defend assertions that the venture is attractive and sustainable and
has a competitive edge
Business Plan Credibility Principles
Business plan writers must strive to project credibility (Hindle & Mainprize, 2006), so there must be a match
between what the entrepreneurship team (resource seekers) needs and what the investors (resource providers)
expect based on their criteria. A take it or leave it approach (i.e. financial forecasts set in concrete) by the
entrepreneurship team has a high likelihood of failure in terms of securing resources. Hindle and Mainprize (2006)
outline five principles to help entrepreneurs project credibility:
• Team
◦ Without the right team, nothing else matters.
◦ Communicate
▪ What do they know?
▪ Who do they know?
▪ How well are they known?
• Elaboration
◦ Break down individual tasks into their sub-parts so each step maximizes the upside and
minimizes the downside:
▪ sub-strategies
▪ ad-hoc programs
▪ specific tactical action plans
• Scenario Integration
◦ Claiming an insuperable lead or a proprietary market position is naïve.
◦ Venture building is like chess:
▪ Anticipate several moves in advance
▪ View the future as a movie vs. snapshot
• Financial Link
◦ Key assumptions related to market size, penetration rates, and timing issues of market
context outlined in the business plan should link directly to the financial statements.
◦ Income and cash flow statements must be preceded by operational statements setting forth

51 • LEE A. SWANSON

the primary planning assumptions about market sizes, sales, productivity, and basis for the
revenue estimate.
• The Deal
◦ If the main purpose is to enact a harvest, then the business plan must create a value-adding
deal structure to attract investors.
◦ Common things: viability, profit potential, downside risk, likely life-cycle time, potential
areas for dispute or improvement

General Business Plan Guidelines
Many businesses must have a business plan to achieve their goals. The following are some basic guidelines for
business plan development.
• A standard format helps the reader understand that the entrepreneur has thought everything through,
and that the returns justify the risk.
• Binding the document ensures that readers can easily go through it without it falling apart.
• Be 100% certain that
◦ everything is completely integrated: the written part must say exactly the same thing as the
financial part
◦ all financial statements are completely linked and valid (make sure all balance sheets validly
balance)
◦ the document is well formatted (layout makes document easy to read and
comprehend—including all diagrams, charts, statements, and other additions)
◦ everything is correct (there are NO spelling, grammar, sentence structure, referencing, or
calculation errors)
◦ the document easy to read and comprehend because it is organized well with no unnecessary
repetition
▪ It is usually unnecessary—and even damaging—to state the same thing more than
once. To avoid unnecessarily duplicating information, you should combine
sections and reduce or eliminate duplication as much as possible.
◦ all the necessary information is included to enable readers to understand everything in your
document
◦ the terms you use in your plan are clear
▪ For example, if your plan says something like “there is a shortage of 100,000 units
with competitors currently producing 25,000. We can help fill this huge gap in
demand with our capacity to produce 5,000 units,” a reader is left completely

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 52

confused. Does this mean there is a total shortage of 100,000 units, but competitors
are filling this gap by producing 25,000 per year (in which case there will only be
a shortage for four years)? Or, is there an annual shortage of 100,000 units with
only 25,000 being produced each year, in which case the total shortage is very high
and is growing each year? You must always provide the complete perspective by
indicating the appropriate time frame, currency, size, or another measurement.
◦ if you use a percentage figure, you indicate to what it refers, otherwise the figure is
completely useless to a reader.
◦ if your plan includes an international element, which currencies the costs, revenues, prices,
or other values are quoted in
▪ This can be solved by indicating up-front in the document the currency in which
all values will be quoted. Another option is to indicate each time which currency is
being used, and sometimes you might want to indicate the value in more than one
currency. Of course, you will need to assess the exchange rate risk to which you
will be exposed and describe this in your document.
• credibility is both established and maintained
◦ If a statement is included that presents something as a fact when this fact is not generally
known, always indicate the source. Unsupported statements damage credibility
◦ Be specific. A business plan is simply not of value if it uses vague references to high
demand, carefully set prices, and other weak phrasing. It must show hard numbers (properly
referenced, of course), actual prices, and real data acquired through proper research. This is
the only way to ensure your plan is considered credible.

Developing a High Power Business Plan
The business plan development process described next has been extensively tested with entrepreneurship students
and has proven to provide the guidance entrepreneurs need to develop a business plan appropriate for their needs;
a high power business plan.
The Stages of Development
There are six stages involved with developing a high power business plan. These stages can be compared to a
process for hosting a dinner for a few friends. A host hoping to make a good impression with their anticipated
guests might analyze the situation at multiple levels to collect data on new alternatives for healthy ingredients,
what ingredients have the best prices and are most readily available at certain times of year, the new trends in
party appetizers, what food allergies the expected guests might have, possible party themes to consider, and so
on. This analysis is the Essential Initial Research stage.

53 • LEE A. SWANSON

In the Business Model stage, the host might construct a menu of items to include with the meal along with a list
of decorations to order, music to play, and costume themes to suggest to the guests. The mix of these kinds of
elements chosen by the host will play a role in the success of the party.
The Initial Business Plan Draft stage is where the host rolls up his or her sleeves and begins to assemble make
some of the food items, put up some of the decorations, send invitations, and generally get everything started for
the party.
During this stage, the host will begin to realize that some plans are not feasible and that changes are needed. The
required changes might be substantial, like the need to postpone the entire party and ultimately start over in a few
months, or less drastic, like the need to change the menu when an invited guest indicates that they can’t eat food
containing gluten. These changes are incorporated into the plan to make it realistic and feasible in the Making the
Business Plan Realistic stage.
Making A Plan to Appeal to Stakeholders stage involves further changes to the party plan to make it more
appealing to both the invited guests and to make it a fun experience for the host. For example, the host might learn
that some of the single guests would like to bring dates and others might need to be able to bring their children to
be able to attend. The host might be able to accommodate those desires or needs in ways that will also make the
party more fun for them—maybe by accepting some guests’ offers to bring food or games, or maybe even hiring
a babysitter to entertain and look after the children.
The final stage—Finishing the Business Plan—involves the host putting all of the final touches in place for the
party in preparation for the arrival of the guests.

Essential Initial Research
A business plan writer should analyze the environment in which they anticipate operating at each of the societal,
industry, market, and firm levels of analysis (see pages 51–60). This stage of planning, the essential initial
research, is a necessary first step to better understand the trends that will affect their business and the decisions
they must make to lay the groundwork for, and to improve their potential for success.
In some cases, much of the essential initial research should be included in the developing business plan as its own
separate section to help build the case for readers that there is a market need for the business being considered and
that it stands a good chance of being successful.
In other cases, a business plan will be stronger when the components of the essential initial research are distributed
throughout the business plan as a way to provide support for the plans and strategies outlined in the business plan.
For example, the industry or market part of the essential initial research might outline the pricing strategies used
by identified competitors and might be best placed in the pricing strategy part of the business plan to support the
decision made to employ a particular pricing strategy.
Business Model
Inherent in any business plan is a description of the business model chosen by the entrepreneur as the one that
they feel will best ensure success. Based upon their essential initial research of the setting in which they anticipate
starting their business (their analysis from stage one) an entrepreneur should determine how each element of
their business model—including their revenue streams, cost structure, customer segments, value propositions, key
activities, key partners, and so on—might fit together to improve the potential success of their business venture
(see Chapter 4 – Business Models).
For some types of ventures, at this stage an entrepreneur might launch a lean start-up (see page 68) and grow their
business by continually pivoting, or constantly adjusting their business model in response to the real-time signals
they get from the markets’ reactions to their business operations. In many cases, however, an entrepreneur will
require a business plan. In those cases, their initial business model will provide the basis for that plan.
Of course, throughout this and all of the rounds in this process, the entrepreneur should seek to continually gather
information and adjust the plans in response to the new knowledge they gather. As shown in Figure 8 by its
enclosure in the progressive research box, the business plan developer might need conduct further research before
finishing the business model and moving on to the initial business plan draft.
Initial Business Plan Draft
The Business Plan Draft stage involves taking the knowledge and ideas developed during the first two stages and
organizing them into a business plan format. An approach preferred by many is to create a full draft of the business
plan with all of the sections, including the front part with the business description, vision, mission, values, value
proposition statement, preliminary set of goals, and possibly even a table of contents and lists of tables and figures
all set up using the software features enabling their automatic generation. Writing all of the operations, human
resources, marketing, and financial plans as part of the first draft ensures that all of these parts can be appropriately

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 56

and necessarily integrated. The business plan will tell the story of a planned business startup in two ways by using
primarily words along with some charts and graphs in the operations, human resources, and marketing plans and
in a second way through the financial plan. Both ways must tell the same story.
The feedback loop shown in Figure 8 demonstrates that the business developer may need to review the business
model. Additionally, as shown by its enclosure in the progressive research box, the business plan developer might
need conduct further research before finishing the Initial Business Plan Draft stage and moving on to the Making
Business Plan Realisticstage.
Making Business Plan Realistic
The first draft of a business plan will almost never be realistic. As the entrepreneur writes the plan, it will
necessarily change as new information is gathered. Another factor that usually renders the first draft unrealistic
is the difficulty in making certain that the written part—in the front part of the plan along with the operations,
human resources, and marketing plans—tells the exact same story as the financial part does. This stage of work
involves making the necessary adjustments to the plan to make it as realistic as possible.
The Making Business Plan Realistic stage has two possible feedback loops. The first goes back to the Initial
Business Plan Draft stage in case the initial business plan needs to be significantly changed before it is possible to
adjust it so that it is realistic. The second feedback loop circles back to the Business Model stage if the business
developer need to rethink the business model. As shown in Figure 8 by its enclosure in the progressive research
box, the business plan developer might need conduct further research before finishing the Making Business Plan
Realistic stage and moving on to the Making Plan Appeal to Stakeholders stage.
Making Plan Appeal to Stakeholders and Desirable to the Entrepreneur
A business plan can be realistic without appealing to potential investors and other external stakeholders, like
employees, suppliers, and needed business partners. It might also be realistic (and possibly appealing to
stakeholders) without being desirable to the entrepreneur. During this stage the entrepreneur will keep the business
plan realistic as they adjust plans to appeal to potential investors and to themselves.
If, for example, investors will be required to finance the business start, some adjustments might need to be
relatively extensive to appeal to potential investors’ needs for an exit strategy from the business, to accommodate
the rate of return they expect from their investments, and to convince them that the entrepreneur can accomplish
all that is promised in the plan. In this case, and in others, the entrepreneur will also need to get what they want out
of the business to make it worthwhile for them to start and run it. So, this stage of adjustments to the developing
business plan might be fairly extensive, and they must be informed by a superior knowledge of what targeted
investors need from a business proposal before they will invest. They also need to be informed by a clear set of
goals that will make the venture worthwhile for the entrepreneur to pursue.
The caution with this stage is to balance the need to make realistic plans with the desire to meet the entrepreneur’s
goals while avoiding becoming discouraged enough to drop the idea of pursuing the business idea. If an
entrepreneur is convinced that the proposed venture will satisfy a valid market need, there is often a way to

57 • LEE A. SWANSON

assemble the financing required to start and operate the business while also meeting the entrepreneur’s most
important goals. To do so, however, might require significant changes to the business model.
One of the feedback loops shown in Figure 8 indicates that the business plan writer might need to adjust the draft
business plan while ensuring that it is still realistic before it can be made appealing to the targeted stakeholders
and desirable to the entrepreneur. The second feedback loop indicates that it might be necessary to go all the way
back to the Business Model stage to re-establish the framework and plans needed to develop a realistic, appealing,
and desirable business plan. Additionally, this stage’s enclosure in the progressive research box suggests that the
business plan developer might need conduct further research.
Finishing the Business Plan
The final stage involves putting all of the important finishing touches on the business plan so that it will present
well to potential investors and others. This involves making sure that the math and links between the written and
financial parts are accurate. It also involves ensuring that all the needed corrections are made to the spelling,
grammar, and formatting. The final set of goals should be written to appeal to the target readers and to reflect what
the business plan says. An executive summary should be written and included as a final step.

General Business Plan Format
Title page
Include nice, catchy, professional, appropriate graphics to make it appealing for targeted readers
Executive summary
• Can be longer than normal executive summaries, up to three pages
• Write after remainder of plan is complete

their first impressions of the business idea and decide whether they wish to read the rest of the plan
Table of Contents
List of Tables
Each table, figure, and appendix included in the plan must be referenced within the text of the plan so the
relevance of each of these elements is clear.

• Corporation
• Cooperative
As part of your business set-up, you need to determine what kinds of control systems you should have in place,
establish necessary relationships with suppliers and prior to your start-up, and generally deal with a list of issues
like the following. Many of your decisions related to the following should be described somewhere in your
business plan:

supports the cash flow and income statements shown later
Key Personnel
• May include brief biographies of the key organizational people
Marketing Plan
• What primary and secondary research have you done?
◦ You must show evidence of having done proper research, both primary and secondary. If you
make a statement of fact, you must back it up with properly referenced supporting evidence.
If you indicate a claim is based on your own assumptions, you must back this up with a
description as to how you came to the conclusion.
• Somewhere in your plan have you done an effective analysis of the economic environment relevant to
your business?

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 66

◦ It is a given that you must provide some assessment of the economic situation as it relates to
your business. For example, you might conclude that the current economic crisis will reduce
the potential to export your product and it may make it more difficult to acquire credit with
which to operate your business. Of course, conclusions such as these should be matched with
your assessment as to how your business will make the necessary adjustments to ensure it
will thrive despite these challenges, or how it will take advantage of any opportunities your
assessment uncovers.
• Somewhere in your plan have you done an effective assessment of the industry within which your
venture will operate?
◦ You must provide an assessment of the industry coupled with descriptions of how your
venture will prosper in those circumstances. A common approach used to assess the industry
is to apply Porter’s (1985) Five Forces Model.
▪ If you apply the Five Forces Model, do so in the way in which it was meant to be
used to avoid significantly reducing its usefulness while also harming the viability
of your industry analysis. This model is meant to be used to consider the entire
industry—not a subcomponent of it (and it usually cannot be used to analyze a
single organization).
◦ Your competitor analysis might fit within your assessment of the industry or it might be best
as a section within your marketing plan. Usually a fairly detailed description of your
competitors is required, including an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. In some
cases, your business may have direct and indirect competitors to consider. Be certain to
maintain credibility by demonstrating that you fully understand the competitive
environment.
◦ Assessments of the economic conditions and the state of the industry appear incomplete
without accompanying appraisals outlining the strategies the organization can/should employ
to take advantage of these economic and industry situations. So, depending upon how you
have organized your work, it is usually important to couple your appraisal of the economic
and industry conditions with accompanying strategies for your venture. This shows the
reader that you not only understand the operating environment, but that you have figured out
how best to operate your business within that situation.
• Have you done an effective analysis of your venture? (See the Organizational Analysis section below.)
Market Analysis
• Usually contains customer profiles, constructed through primary and secondary research, for each
market targeted
• Contains detailed information on the major product benefits you will deliver to the markets targeted
• Describes the methodology used and the relevant results from the primary market research done

67 • LEE A. SWANSON

• If there was little primary research completed, justifies why it is acceptable to have done little of this
kind of research and/or indicate what will be done and by when
• Includes a complete description of the secondary research conducted and the conclusions reached
• Describes potential customers
◦ Define your target market in terms of identifiable entities sharing common characteristics.
For example, it is not meaningful to indicate you are targeting Canadian universities. It is,
however, useful to define your target market as Canadian university students between the
ages of 18 and 25, or as information technology managers at Canadian universities, or as
student leaders at Canadian universities. Your targeted customer should generally be able to
make or significantly influence the buying decision.
◦ You must usually define your target market prior to describing your marketing mix,
including your proposed product line. Sometimes the product descriptions in business plans
seem to be at odds with the described target market characteristics. Ensure your defined
target market aligns completely with your marketing mix (including product/service
description, distribution channels, promotional methods, and pricing). For example, if the
target market is defined as Canadian university students between the ages of 18 and 25, the
product component of the marketing mix should clearly be something that appeals to this
target market.
◦ Carefully choose how you will target potential customers. Should you target them based on
their demographic characteristics, psychographic characteristics, or geographic location?
• Identifies how your targeted customers make their buying decisions
◦ You will need to access research to answer this question. Based on what you discover, you
will need to figure out the optimum mix of pricing, distribution, promotions, and product
decisions to best appeal to how your targeted customers make their buying decisions.
Competition
• Fully describes the nature of your competitors
◦ However, this information might fit instead under the market analysis section.
• Describes all your direct competitors
• Describes all your indirect competitors
• If you can, includes a competitor positioning map to show where your product will be positioned
relative to competitors’ products

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 68

Figure 6 – Competitor Positioning Map (Illustration by Lee A. Swanson)

• Identifies your competitive advantage
◦ What distinguishes your business from that of your competitors in a way that will ensure
your sales forecasts will be met?
◦ What is your venture’s value proposition?
▪ You must clearly communicate the answers to these questions in your business
plan to attract the needed support for your business. One caution is that it may
sound appealing to claim you will provide a superior service to the existing
competitors, but the only meaningful judge of your success in this regard will be
customers. Although it is possible some of your competitors might be complacent
in their current way of doing things, it is very unlikely that all your competitors
provide an inferior service to that which you will be able to provide.
Marketing Strategy
• Covers all aspects of the marketing mix including the promotional decisions you have made, product
decisions, distribution decisions related to how you will deliver your product to the markets targeted,
and pricing decisions

69 • LEE A. SWANSON

• Outlines how you plan to influence your targeted customers to buy from you (what is the optimum
marketing mix, and why is this one better than the alternatives)
Organizational Analysis
• Leads in to your marketing strategy or is positioned elsewhere depending upon how your business plan
is best structured
• Often applies a SWOT Analysis
◦ If doing so, always ensure this analysis results in more than a simple list of internal strengths
and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats. A SWOT analysis should always
prove to the reader that there are organizational strategies in place to address each of the
weaknesses and threats identified and to leverage each of the strengths and opportunities
identified.
• An effective way to ensure an effective outcome to your SWOT Analysis is to apply a TOWS Matrix
approach to develop strategies to take advantage of the identified strengths and opportunities while
mitigating the weaknesses and threats. A TOWS Matrix evaluates each of the identified threats along
with each of the weaknesses and then each of the strengths. It does the same with each of the identified
opportunities. In this way strategies are developed by considering pairs of factors
• The TOWS Matrix is a framework with which to help you organize your thoughts into strategies. Most
often you would not label a section of your business plan as a TOWS Matrix. This would not normally
add value for the reader. Instead, you should describe the resultant strategies—perhaps while
indicating how they were derived from your assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats. For example, you could indicate that certain strategies were developed by considering how
internal strengths could be employed toward mitigating external threats faced by the business.
Product Strategy
• Identifies your product/service and why this particular product/service will appeal to your targeted
customers more than the alternatives
◦ If your product or service is standardized, you will need to compete on the basis of
something else – like a more appealing price, having a superior location, better branding, or
improved service. If you can differentiate your product or service you might be able to
compete on the basis of better quality, more features, appealing style, or something else.
When describing your product, you should demonstrate that you understand this.
Pricing Strategy
• Outlines your pricing strategies and explains what makes these strategies better than the alternatives
◦ If you intend to accept payment by credit card (which is probably a necessity for most
companies), you should be aware of the fee you are charged as a percentage of the value of

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 70

each transaction. If you don’t account for this you risk overstating your actual revenues by
perhaps one percent or more.
• Identifies your sales forecasts and explains why are these realistic
◦ Sales forecasts must be done on at least a monthly basis if you are using a projected cash
flow statement. These must be accompanied by explanations designed to establish their
credibility for readers of your business plan. Remember that many readers will initially
assume that your planned time frames are too long, your revenues are overstated, and you
have underestimated your expenses. Well crafted explanations for all of these numbers will
help establish credibility.
Distribution Strategy
• Describes your distribution strategies and explains what makes these strategies better than the
alternatives
◦ If you plan to use e-commerce, you should include all the costs associated with maintaining
a website and accepting payments over the Internet.
Promotions Strategy
• Answers the following key questions:
◦ As a new entrant into the market, must you attract your customers away from your
competitors they currently buy from or will you be creating new customers for your product
or service (i.e. not attracting customers away from your competitors)?
▪ If you are attracting customers away from competitors, how will these rivals
respond to the threat you pose to them?
▪ If you intend to create new customers, how will you convince them to reallocate
their dollars toward your product or service (and away from other things they want
to purchase)?
▪ In what ways will you communicate with your targeted customers? When will you
communicate with them? What specific messages do you plan to convey to them?
How much will this promotions plan cost?
• Outlines the anticipated responses that competitors will have to your entrance into the market,
especially if your success depends upon these businesses losing customers to you
◦ If your entry into the market will not be a threat to direct competitors, it is likely you must
convince potential customers to spend their money with you rather than on what they had
previously earmarked those dollars toward. In your business plan you must demonstrate an
awareness of these issues.
• Maps out your promotional expenditures according to the method used and time frame

71 • LEE A. SWANSON

◦ Consider listing the promotional methods in rows on a spreadsheet with the columns
representing weeks or months over probably about 18 months from the time of your first
promotional expenditure. This can end up being a schedule that feeds the costs into your
projected cash flow statement and from there into your projected income statements.
◦ If you phone or visit newspapers, radio stations, or television stations seeking advertising
costs, you must go only after you have figured out details like on which days you would like
to advertise, at what times on those days, whether you want your print advertisements in
color, and what size of print advertisements you want.
◦ Carefully consider which promotional methods you will use. While using a medium like
television may initially sound appealing, it is very expensive unless your ad runs during the
non-prime times. If you think this type of medium might work for you, do a serious costbenefit analysis to be sure.
◦ Some promotional plans are developed around newspaper ads, promotional pamphlets,
printing business cards, and other more obvious mediums of promotion. Be certain to,
include the costs of advertising in telephone directories, sponsoring a little league soccer
team, producing personalized pens and other promotional client give-always, donating items
to charity auctions, printing and mailing client Christmas cards, and doing the many things
businesses find they do on-the-fly. Many businesses find it to be useful to join the local
chamber of commerce and relevant trade organizations with which to network. Some find
that setting a booth up at a trade fair helps launch their business.
◦ If you are concerned you might have missed some of these promotional expenses, or if you
want to have a buffer in place in case you feel some of these opportunities are worthwhile
when they arise, you should add some discretionary money to your promotional budget. A
problem some companies get into is planning out their promotions in advance only to
reallocate some of their newspaper advertisement money, for example, toward some of these
other surprise purposes resulting in less newspaper advertising than had been intended.
Financial Plan
• Outlines financial projections
◦ It is nearly certain you will need to make monthly cash flow projections from business
inception to possibly three years out. Your projections will show the months in which the
activities shown on your fixed capital and working capital schedules will occur. This is
nearly the only way to clearly estimate your working capital needs and, specifically,
important things like the times when you will need to draw on or can pay down your
operating loans and the months when you will need to take out longer-term loans with which
to purchase your fixed assets. Without a tool like this you will be severely handicapped when
talking with bankers about your expected needs. They will want to know how large of a line
of credit you will need and when you anticipate needing to borrow longer-term money. It is

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 72

development

Overview
Securing needed financing is one of the most important functions related to starting a business. It is important,
then, to understand what sources of financing exist at various stages of venture development. It is also important
to determine what kinds of financing provide the most value for the entrepreneur and the new venture. Debt and
equity financing decisions must be considered in relation to the cost of the financing and the amount of control
that the owner is willing to sacrifice to get the needed resources.

Financing
Starting Capital
Entrepreneurs almost always require starting capital to move their ideas forward to the point where they can start
their ventures. Determining the amount of money that is actually needed is tricky because that requirement can
change as plans evolve. Other challenges include actually securing the amount desired and getting it when it is
needed. If an entrepreneur is unable to secure the required amount or cannot get the funding when needed, they
must develop new plans.
Once a venture begins to make cash sales or it starts to receive the money earned through credit sales, it can use
those resources to fund some of its activities. Until then, it must get the money it needs through other sources.
Bootstrap financing is when entrepreneurs use their ingenuity to make their existing resources, including money
and time, stretch as far as possible—usually out of necessity until they can transform their venture into one that
outside investors will find appealing enough to invest in.
Personal Money
Entrepreneurs will almost always have to invest their own personal money into their start-up before others
will give them any financial help. Sometimes entrepreneurs form businesses as partnerships or as multi-owner
corporations with other individual entrepreneurs who also contribute their own personal funds to the venture.
Love Money
Love money refers to money provided by friends and family who want to support an entrepreneur, often when they
have no other ready source of funding after using as much of their own personal money as possible to support
their start-up.
Grants and Start-up Prize Money
In some cases, grants that do not need to be repaid might be provided by government or other agencies to support
new venture start-ups. Sometimes entrepreneurs can enter business planning or similar competitions in which they
might win money and other benefits, like free office or retail space, or free legal or accounting services for a set
period of time.
Debt Financing
From an entrepreneur’s perspective, the cost of debt financing is the interest that they pay for the use of the money
that they borrow. From an investor’s perspective, their reward, or return on debt financing, is the interest that they
gain in addition to the return of the money that they lent to an entrepreneur or other borrower.
To provide some protection for the investor (lender) to enable them to accept an interest rate that is also acceptable
for the entrepreneur (borrower), the borrower must often pledge collateral so that if they do not pay back the loan

75 • LEE A. SWANSON

along with interest as arranged, the lender has a way to get all or some of the money they are owed. If a borrower
defaults on a loan, the lender can become the owner of the property pledged as collateral. A key objective for an
entrepreneur seeking debt financing is to provide sufficient collateral to get the loan, but not pledge so much that
they put essential property at risk.
When entrepreneurs borrow money, they must pay it back subject to the terms of the loan. The loan terms include
the specific interest rate that will be charged and the time period within which the loan needs to be repaid. Several
other terms or features of the loan that can be negotiated between lender and borrowers. One such feature is
whether the loan can be converted to equity at a particular point in time and according to certain criteria and
subject to specific terms.
Sometimes debt financing can be in the form of trade credit, where a supplier provides product to a business but
does not require payment for a specific length of time, or perhaps even until the business has sold the product to a
customer. Another form of debt financing is customer advances. This might involve a customer paying in advance
for a product or service so that the businesses has those funds available to use to pay its suppliers.
Advantages of Debt Financing
One advantage of debt financing is that the entrepreneur is not sacrificing ownership and some control of their
venture when they take out a loan.
Another advantage of debt financing is the certainty of the payments the borrower needs to make during the term
of the loan. If the borrower takes out a loan for $20,000 over a five-year term at a fixed interest rate of 6.2% with a
monthly payment schedule designed to pay off the entire loan by the end of its five-year term, they know that each
month they must pay $389 and that over the five years they will have paid back the entire $20,000 loan amount
plus a total of $3,340 in interest. With this certainty, the business can accurately budget its payback amount for
this loan over the five years.
Yet another advantage of debt financing is that it allows companies to trade on equity. Trading on equity enhances
the rate of return on common shareholders’ equity by using debt to financing asset purchases or to take other
measures that are expected to cost less than the earnings generated by the action taken. For example, if a company
borrows $20,000 at 6.2% interest and uses that money to purchase a machine it will use to increase its return on
equity by 20%, then it is trading on equity. In this case, the company is financially better off than it would have
been if it had not taken out the loan. Of course, the inherent risk involved with this strategy is lowered when
income streams are relatively stable.
Disadvantages of Debt Financing
A disadvantage of borrowing money is the need to report to those from whom you borrowed the money.
This might be particularly true when lenders, often bankers, have interests or incentives—mainly getting their
money back plus at all of the interest owed to them during the loan term through regular monthly blended loan
payments—that might not fully align with the interests and incentives of the borrower, which might include being
able to pay the money back when they are best able to do so without also impacting other parts of their business,

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 76

like the need to pay their employees or their facility lease payment at the end of a month when an expected
customer payment did not arrive as planned.
Another disadvantage of borrowing is that the business’s ownership of the property it pledged as collateral for
the loan is placed at risk. For many new ventures, a loan is only possible to acquire if the owner provides their
personal guarantee that the money will be paid back as determined in the loan agreement, thus putting personal
property at risk.
Equity financing
From an entrepreneur’s perspective, the cost of equity financing is the loss of some control over their venture
as they must now share ownership of the business. From an investor’s perspective, their reward in exchange
for purchasing an ownership interest in the business is the potential to share in the business’s anticipated future
success by possibly receiving dividends (a portion of the profit that is distributed to owners) and by possibly being
able to sell their ownership interest to another investor for more than the amount they purchased that ownership
interest for originally.
The protection for the investor, who might be a shareholder if the ownership interest is represented in the form
of shares in the business, is in the influence they can exert in the company’s decision-making processes. This
influence is normally proportionate to their share of the ownership in the overall business. Equity investors
normally seek to earn a competitive return on their investment that is in line with the level of risk they assume by
investing in the business. The riskier the investment, the higher the return the investor expects.
Public Offering
Stock investors might invest in a public offering where the company’s shares are made available to the
public—and by which the company becomes a public company. An initial public offering (IPO) is where a
company’s stock (its shares) are sold to institutional investors who then resell them to the public, usually through
a securities exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).
When an IPO occurs, a company goes through a legal process to sell shares in its company for the purpose of
raising capital. This is called going public. An important part of going public is setting the initial price for the
shares being offered for sale (the offering price). The amount that the company will raise is the price they sell
the new stock at multiplied by the number of shares they sell less any fees and other expenses incurred to make
the sale. If they set the initial selling price of the shares too high, they might not sell all of the shares and the
company won’t raise as much capital as anticipated. If they happen to sell all of the overvalued shares, the share
price will fall once it begins trading on the exchange. Setting the offering price too high indicates that the company
and its agents helping it with its IPO, called underwriters, have valued the company higher than investors in the
marketplace value it. If the company sets the offering price too low, it will raise the amount of money planned,
but will find out too late that it could have raised much more capital by setting the offering price higher. In this
case, the company and its underwriters have undervalued the company and the initial investors will make all of
the gains that the company could have when they sell the shares on the exchange almost immediately after they
purchased them for more money than they purchased them for.

77 • LEE A. SWANSON

Private Offering
Stock investors might also invest in a private offering (or private placement) where the shares are sold to a few
investors rather than to the general public through an exchange. Institutional private placements involve selling
the shares to institutional investors like insurance companies. Private offerings cost less and are subject to less
stringent regulation than public offerings, mainly because it is expected that private investors will be more diligent
on their own and require less regulatory protection than do public investors.
Venture Capital
Venture capital is raised when investors pool their money. The venture capital fund is then used to very carefully
invest in existing but usually young companies that are expected to experience high growth. The venture capital
company does not expect to invest for long and it expects to generate a large return. For example, it might expect
to invest in an opportunity for a period of up to five years and then get out of the investment with five times the
money it originally invested. Of course, only some investment opportunities will generate the returns hoped for
and others will return far less than expected.
Venture capitalists might exert some ownership control by influencing some business decisions in cases where
they believe that by doing so they can protect their investment or cause the investment to produce greater returns,
but they generally prefer to invest in companies that are going to be well-run and will not require them to be
involved in decisions. Venture capitalists might also provide some assistance, such as business advice, to the
companies in which they invest.
A venture round refers to a phase of financing that institutional investors like venture capitalists provide to
entrepreneurs. The first phase (sometimes following a seed round in which entrepreneurs themselves provide
the start-up capital and then an angel round where angel investors invest in the company) is called Series A.
Subsequent venture rounds are called Series B, Series C, and so on.
Angel Investors
Angel investors are wealthy individuals who on their own, or often along with other angel investors in a
network—like the Saskatchewan Capital Network—invest in new ventures in exchange for an ownership interest
in the business. Sometimes angels invest in companies in exchange for convertible debt, an investment that starts
off as a loan, usually in the form of a bond, that they can exercise an option to convert to an equity interest in
the company at a particular point in time for a pre-determined number of shares. Angel investors are generally
less restricted in what kinds of investments they will consider as opposed to venture capitalists, who are using
other people’s pooled money. Like venture capitalists, however, they normally undertake a rigorous due diligence
process to determine whether to invest in the opportunities they are considering.
Equity Crowd Funding
Equity crowd funding is a relatively new way for entrepreneurs to raise capital. It involves using online methods
to promote equity interests in ventures to potential investors.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 78

Due Diligence
Investors follow due diligence processes to assess the risk and potential return associated with the investments
they are considering. As such, entrepreneurs should maintain a due diligence file or binder that they can quickly
draw upon when a desirable potential investor expresses an interest in their venture.
A due diligence file or binder will include copies of many of the legal papers and other important documents
that a venture has accumulated that tell the story of the enterprise. These documents will include those related
to incorporation, securities it has issued or is in the process of issuing, loans, important contracts, intellectual
property documents, tax information, financial statements, and other important documentation.
Advantages of Equity Financing
One important benefit to equity financing is that it does not normally require a regular payback from cash flow.
Unlike with debt financing, equity investments do not usually give rise to a regular encumbrance that can increase
the difficulty a young company might have in meeting its regular monthly expenses.
Second, when a firm uses equity financing, it does not need to pledge collateral, which means that the company’s
assets are not placed at risk.
A potential advantage with equity financing is that, depending upon the form of financing and who the investors
are, a firm might gain valued advisers. In addition, investors who exercise their ownership rights to have a say in
the operations of the company, or who otherwise provide advise and mentorship to entrepreneurs starting ventures,
are usually highly motivated to help the company succeed. Investors expect to benefit only when the companies
they invest in succeed, meaning that their financing incentives are aligned with those of the entrepreneur and other
owners.
Disadvantages of Equity Financing
Equity financing is often more difficult to raise than debt financing. Second, when they share ownership in
exchange for investment into their business, entrepreneurs give up a portion of the value that they create. If things
do not go as planned, entrepreneurs can lose control of their companies to their investors.

Sources of Financing for Different Phases of Development
Different financing sources are used at different phases of business development. The appropriate and available
financing sources depend upon the risks and opportunities available to both the entrepreneur and to the investors.
Idea Development Phase
• Personal sources (savings and other income)
• Extended personal sources (family, friends, employees, partners)
• Angel investors (possibly)

79 • LEE A. SWANSON

◦ also called informal investors
◦ wealthy individuals interested in investing their own money in early-stage companies as
convertible debt holders or equity investors
◦ convertible debt (convertible bond, convertible note, convertible debenture) allows the
bondholder to convert their debt into an equity interest at an agreed-upon price
◦ can be a win-win arrangement
▪ If the company is successful, investor has opportunity to participate as equity
investor, but if company is only marginally successful, they get their money back
with interest.
▪ If entrepreneurs have difficulty borrowing money, they can add the convertible
feature as a sweetener.
• Strategic partners
◦ might include potential customers or potential suppliers who want to have access to a
business like the one proposed (and therefore might fund part of its development)—i.e. a
building owner (supplier) might help a business develop which will be a tenant
◦ might include complementary businesses who feel helping the new business get started
might help their own businesses—i.e. a hotel investing in a spa next door to their facility
Start-Up Phase
• Angel investors
• Strategic partners
• Customers (possibly)
◦ They might place orders for services or products and pay for them up-front, thereby
providing financing for the new business.
◦ They might want your business to succeed so it can support their business. For example, a
general contractor (future customer) might help a new plumber get started if there is now a
shortage of plumbers affecting the building industry.
• Venture Capitalists (possibly)
◦ These organizations acquire pools of money to invest, so they differ from angel investors in
that those making the decisions are not investing their own money; this means they usually
consider investment options which have shown some success already (which isn’t usually
the case in the start-up phase).
• Asset-Based lenders
◦ lend money secured by the assets of the borrower – i.e. plant and equipment

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 80

◦ sometimes this can be done quite creatively – i.e. secure a loan with assets that will turn into
money … like through accounts receivable or inventories, etc.
• Equipment Leasing Companies
• Suppliers
Early Operations
• Venture Capitalists (possibly)
• Asset-Based Lenders
• Equipment Leasing Companies
• Suppliers
• Small Business Investment Companies
◦ U.S. term – developed to bridge the gap between when small businesses need money and the
time later on when venture capitalists might provide financing to small businesses
◦ SBICs are privately owned companies in the United States that are licensed by the Small
Business Administration (U.S. Government) to supply equity capital, long-term loans, and
management assistance to qualifying small businesses
◦ Canadian equivalent = Community Futures Corporations
• Trade Credit
◦ The supplier provides product now on terms so the retailer does not need to pay the supplier
for perhaps 30 or 60 or 90 days
◦ The retailer can then sell the product and collecting the money from the customer before the
retailer needs to pay supplier for it the product.
• Factoring
◦ when a business sells its accounts receivable (its invoices) to a third party (called a factor) at
a discount in exchange for immediate money
◦ differs from bank loan in three ways
▪ The factor is interested in the value of the receivables; a bank is interested in the
firm’s creditworthiness.
▪ Factoring is not a loan; it is the purchase of a financial asset (the receivables).
▪ A bank loan involves two parties (lender and borrower); factoring involves three
(the business, the factor, and those who owe the money).

81 • LEE A. SWANSON

Growth Phase
• Venture Capitalists
• Asset-Based Lenders
• Equipment Leasing Companies
• Suppliers
• Small Business Investment Companies
• Trade Credit
• Factoring
• Mezzanine Lenders
◦ used to fill the financing gap between relatively expensive equity financing and less
expensive forms of financing like secured loans
◦ structured either as an unsecured or subordinated debt instrument or as preferred stock
◦ represents a claim on assets which is senior only to that of the common shares
◦ mezzanine debt holders require a higher return than is the case with holders of secured debt
(maybe close to 20% or more – because the risk is higher)
◦ usually issued as private placements (i.e. fewer legal requirements than with public
placements)
◦ can be used by smaller companies
◦ mezzanine lenders might have right to convert the debt instrument to an equity instrument
◦ mezzanine lenders work with companies to ensure the high return they require doesn’t
cripple the company, so they might take an equity interest or might defer loan payments until
the end of loan term or until the company is sold
Exit or Harvest Phase
• Mezzanine Lenders
• Public Debt
• Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)
◦ issuing common stock or shares to the public
◦ used by companies seeking capital to expand (or by privately-owned companies wanting to
become publicly traded)
◦ a major challenge is to figure out how to value the shares offered so underwriting firms are
often used to help deal with this challenge

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 82

▪ if the price is set too high maybe all the shares will not be sold (and the desired
amount of money will not be raised)
▪ if the price is set too low the company might lose out on money it could have had
(if all the shares sold had of been sold at a higher price)
◦ money from initial sale of shares goes to the company, but after that the shares are traded
between shareholders (the company doesn’t get any of this money)
◦ the money never has to be repaid, but the owners of the shares have a right to any distributed
profits (dividends declared) and to residual dissolution proceeds (what is left over after the
debt holders and everyone else is paid off if the company assets are sold)
• Acquisition, Leveraged Buy-Outs (LBO), Management Buy-Outs (MBO)
◦ LBOs are when the controlling interest in the company is purchased using mainly borrowed
money (the assets of the company being purchased are often used as the loan collateral).
◦ MBOs are often a form of LBOs where the purchasers are the current managers of the
company.

Chapter 7 – Business Set-Up, Start-Up, and Growth

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did
do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore.
Dream. Discover. – Mark Twain
This defines entrepreneur and entrepreneurship—the entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to
it, and exploits it as an opportunity. – Peter Drucker

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter you will be able to
• Explain the considerations entrepreneurs face during the set-up phase of their business
development
• Explain the considerations entrepreneurs face during the start-up phase of their business
development
• Explain the considerations entrepreneurs face during the growth phase of their business
development

Overview
This chapter introduces entrepreneurship topics related to the business set-up phase, start-up phase, and growth
phase. These phases are relevant for most start-ups other than those that follow the lean start-up approach in which
the elements of the phases described in this chapter are blended together in a process that involves releasing and
continually revising product or service prototypes in response to customer feedback.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 84

Set-Up
The goal of the venture set-up phase is to implement the plans needed to start the business prior to its actual startup. This might include developing and testing the products or services the entrepreneur anticipates selling. It also
includes planning around protecting any intellectual property that the venture might have and determine how to
gain competitive advantages over its rivals.
Protecting Intellectual Property
Intellectual property refers to the ideas, goods, and services that can be legally protected by copyrights, patents,
trade secrets, and trademarks.
Copyright
Copyrights provide protection to original software created by someone. They also protect music, literature, and
dramatic and other artistic works for the life of the author of the work plus another 50 years (there are some
modifications to this rule for some works). Copyright arises when someone creates a work whether or not
they register the copyright. It is also not required in Canada to indicate that a work is copyrighted, although
works—like this book—might include the © symbol to remind people that they are copyrighted (even if they are
not registered). A copyright can be registered in Canada for a nominal fee—around $50—but most works that are
created are not registered.
The Canadian Intellectual Property Office provides a searchable Copyrights Database (http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/
opic-cipo/cpyrghts/dsplySrch.do?lang=eng) of the copyrights that have been registered.
The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (2015a) website lists the following categories of copyright protection:
Copyright applies to all original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works provided the conditions set
out in the Copyright Act have been met. Each of these general categories covers a wide range of creations,
including:
• literary works such as books, pamphlets, computer programs and other works consisting of text
• dramatic works such as motion picture films, plays, screenplays and scripts
• musical works such as compositions with or without words
• artistic works such as paintings, drawings, maps, photographs, sculptures and plans
Copyright also applies to other subject-matter consisting of:
• performers’ performances, meaning any of the following:
• a performance of an artistic, dramatic or musical work, whether or not the work was previously
recorded and whether or not the work’s term of copyright protection has expired
• a recitation or reading of a literary work, whether or not the work’s term of copyright protection

85 • LEE A. SWANSON

has expired
• an improvisation of a dramatic, musical or literary work, whether or not the improvised work is
based on a pre-existing work
• sound recordings, meaning recordings consisting of sounds, whether or not a performance of a
work, but excluding any soundtrack of a cinematographic work where it accompanies the
cinematographic work
• communication signals, meaning radio waves transmitted through space without any artificial
guide, for reception by the public (Canadian Intellectual Property Office, 2015a)
Patents
Patents provide protection for 20 years (from date of filing patent application) to inventors by giving them
recourse if others make, use, or sell their invention without permission: “Patents apply to newly developed
technology as well as to improvements on products or processes. Patents provide a time-limited, legally protected,
exclusive right to make, use and sell an invention. In this way, patents serve as a reward for ingenuity” (Canadian
Intellectual Property Office, 2015d).
Patents must be filed in order to provide patent protection to new inventions. It can be time-consuming and
expensive to file patents. The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (2015d) says the following about them:
Patents can have a great deal of value. You can sell them, license them or use them as assets to attract
funding from investors.
In exchange for these benefits, you must provide a full description of the invention when you file a
patent. This helps enrich technical knowledge worldwide. Details of patent applications filed in Canada
are disclosed to the public after an 18-month period of confidentiality.
To be eligible for patent protection, your invention must be:
• new—first in the world
• useful—functional and operative
• inventive—showing ingenuity and not obvious to someone of average skill who works in the field
of your invention
The invention can be:
• a product (e.g., door lock)
• a composition (e.g., chemical composition used in lubricants for door locks)
• a machine (e.g., for making door locks)
• a process (e.g., a method for making door locks)

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 86

• an improvement on any of these (Canadian Intellectual Property Office, 2015d)
You can search the Canadian Patents Database from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office website. If you use
this search engine, notice the level of detail included with each patent entry.
Trademarks
When registered, trademark protection lasts for 15 years and can be often be renewed for another term. The
Canadian Intellectual Property Office (2015c) website lists the three kinds of trademarks:
• An ordinary mark is made up of words, sounds, designs or a combination of these used to distinguish
the goods or services of one person or organization from those of others. For example, suppose you
started a courier business that you chose to call Giddy-up. You could register these words as a
trademark (if you met all the legal requirements) for the service that you offer.
• A certification mark can be licensed to many people or companies for the purpose of showing that
certain goods or services meet a defined standard. For example, the Woolmark design, owned by
Woolmark Americas Ltd., is used on clothing and other goods.
• A distinguishing guise is about the shape of goods or their containers, or a way of wrapping or
packaging goods that shows they have been made by a specific individual or firm. For example, if you
manufactured butterfly-shaped candy you could register the butterfly shape as a distinguishing guise.
(Canadian Intellectual Property Office, 2015c)
Industrial Designs
Original industrial designs can be registered for up to 10 years. They “are about how things look. More technically
speaking, they are the visual features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament, or any combination of these
features, applied to a finished article. For example, the shape of a table or the shape and decoration of a spoon
may be industrial designs” (Canadian Intellectual Property Office, 2015b).
Product/Process/Trade Secrets
Product/process/trade secrets come into play when patents are not filed, but instead innovations are kept secret.
For example, the formula for Coca-Cola and the recipe for the KFC herbs and spices are not registered anywhere,
but instead are kept secret by their owners. This protection lasts for as long as the secret is kept.
Competitive Performance
While entrepreneurs must always strive to establish competitive performance advantages, it is particularly
important when the potential protection afforded by patents, copyrights, trade secrets, or trademarks is weak. In
these cases the best protection is to out-compete rivals with production, pricing, distribution, selling, and other
strategies.

87 • LEE A. SWANSON

Other Set-Up Considerations
Among the other set-up activities for new ventures are the following:
• Attract purchase orders or otherwise line up initial sales
• Set up organizational and legal structure
◦ Sole Proprietorship
◦ Partnership
◦ Limited Partnership
◦ Corporation
◦ Cooperative
• Set up control systems
• Set up relationships with suppliers and others
• Set up everything else in preparation for start-up
◦ Choose name
◦ Check zoning, equipment prices, suppliers, etc.
◦ Choose location
◦ Arrange lease terms, leasehold improvements, signage, pay deposits, etc.
◦ Get business license, permits, etc.
◦ Set up banking arrangements
◦ Set up legal and accounting systems (or professionals)
◦ Order equipment, locks and keys, furniture, etc.
◦ Recruit employees, set up payroll system, benefit programs, etc.
◦ Decide on graphics, logos, promotional methods, etc.
◦ Order business cards, letterhead, etc.
◦ Set up supplier agreements
◦ Buy inventory, insurance, etc.
◦ Revise business plan

Start-Up
The goal of the venture start-up phase is to implement the plans needed to sustain the venture from the time
when it begins making sales until when the business has moved beyond the point where the entrepreneur must

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 88

continually fight for the business’s survival and persistence. It ends when the entrepreneur can instead shift
emphasis toward business growth or maintaining the venture’s stability.
A major consideration during the start-up phase is making the needed sales to establish an adequate cash flow.
Another important consideration is ensuring that the venture is adaptable enough to productively respond to when
things do not proceed as planned. Part of this involves implementing appropriate leadership and management
strategies.

Growth
The goal during the growth phase is to grow or maintain the venture until the time when the entrepreneur chooses
to harvest the value they generated by starting and running the venture. To do this entrepreneurs must continually
monitor their operating environment at all levels: at the societal level using analysis tools like a PESTEL analysis;
at the industry level using a tool like Porter’s Five Forces Model; at the market level using tools like market
profile analyses; and at the firm level using tools like a SWOT Analysis/TOWS Matrix, VRIO, financial analysis
methods, and stakeholder analyses. They must also continually strive to be innovative to generate new ideas and
to maintain their competitive advantages.

However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results. – Winston Churchill
Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it’s about deliberately choosing to be different. – Michael Porter

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter you will be able to
• Describe the considerations associated with a variety of strategic approaches to
entrepreneurship

Overview
There are many strategic considerations for entrepreneurs, including a few big strategic issues like determining
their exit strategies, planning for succession, and embracing ideas like sustainable entrepreneurship.

Exit Strategies
When entrepreneurs decide to exit their business, they follow one or more of the following exit strategies,
sometimes called harvest methods. As any chosen exit strategy will have major implications for the decisions
an entrepreneur makes regarding almost all other aspects of their business, it is important to determine the exit
strategy early.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 90

Private Sale
A private sale involves selling a business to another individual or group. They can be done quite informally,
although it is prudent to seek legal, financial, and sales help to ensure the sale goes smoothly. Selling an ongoing
business can be a fairly complex process that requires expertise that only experienced professionals, like a
business broker, have. One challenge in selling any business is to determine its valuation.
Depending upon when an entrepreneur plans to sell their business, the exit strategy may mean that the business
owner will want to take actions designed to increase the value of the enterprise prior to the sale. It might also
impact the forms of financing the entrepreneur is willing to pursue. For example, an entrepreneur might want
to borrow money to purchase machinery needed to expand the business and increase its value. This might be
more appealing than raising the desired capital by selling ownership interests in the company because, if the
entrepreneur is sharing ownership, they won’t get as much of the sale proceeds when the company is sold.
Public sale
During a public sale, the business is sold to anyone in the general public who can and wants to purchase an
ownership interest in the company.
An initial public offering (IPO) transforms a private company into a public one when shares of stock in the
company are created through a legal process and are sold to members of the general public through a securities
exchange. IPOs are used to raise needed capital for a company. They can also be used to transfer the value that an
entrepreneur has built up in a company into cash for the entrepreneur in exchange for ownership interests for the
investors. In other words, an IPO can be used to sell all or part of a company. Using an IPO to transform a private
company into a public company can also be done for other reasons, like to gain increased exposure.
An IPO process is time-consuming and expensive because of the legal requirements to produce and disclose all
of the required information so that the public can make informed choices when they consider buying the shares.
Working with an underwriter through an investment banking company is essential to try to set the best share price.
If the initial share price is set too high, not all of the shares will be sold and the company won’t raise as much
capital as it had planned. If the initial share price is set too low, the company will end up giving value away. This
happens when the purchasers of the shares buy them at the low initial price and then immediately sell them in the
market at the higher price the market is willing to pay. That profit made by the initial purchaser of the shares could
have instead been realized by the company had the initial share price been set at the right level.
Like with a private sale strategy, a strategy to sell all or part of a business publicly might lead an entrepreneur to
pursue other strategies to increase the value of the firm in the eyes of potential buyers. As public sales usually
apply to companies that are larger in size, it might be possible to for owners to sell part of their company prior
to when they want to sell all of it while retaining control—provided they keep at least 51% of the shares for
themselves.

Hold
A hold situation might involve setting up systems so that the venture can operate without the day-to-day
involvement of the entrepreneur. This often means that the owner must hire and train the right people to operate
the business in their absence.
Unlike a private or public sale where the owner might sell the entire company in exchange for cash, a hold
situation often means that the owner retains some or all of the ownership interest and continues to receive their
share of the distributed profits along with complete or partial say in how the company runs. Sometimes hold
situations are most appropriate for family businesses that intend to stay family businesses when new generations
of family members take over the business operations.
Combination Sale and Hold
Sometimes it is prudent and advantageous for a business owner to sell some of the business and hold some of it.
This might form part of a succession planning strategy.

Succession Planning
A good succession plan will help make the transfer of a business go smoothly, and allow the entrepreneur to
maintain good relationships with employees and business partners. Succession planning helps
• Protect the legacy of your business
• Maintain a service to your community
• Build value for your business
• Provide financial security for your family and your stakeholders
• Deal with unexpected events (illness, accident or death)
• Prepare for the future (Canada Business Network, 2013)
Business owners should begin their succession planning as soon as they are able because the process takes time
and the decisions made now can affect the opportunities for achieving succession and exit strategy goals later. The
process for succession planning should include the following considerations (Canada Business Network, 2013):
• The owner should establish their goals for the business up to and post-retirement, including whether
they wants to retain an ownership interest in the company after stepping aside from the day-to-day
operations of the business.
• Decision-making processes should be established, especially for when or if the current owner decides
to pass the business on to a successor.
• Any potential successors should be trained in the business operations.
• The owner should prepare a good estate plan so that all income tax and financial factors and

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 92

implications are considered.
• The owner should have a contingency plan in place in case the original plans do not turn out as
intended.
• The owner should plan how to transfer the business, should valuate it, and should determine their exit
strategy.

Sustainable Entrepreneurship
The relatively recent focus by businesses on their corporate social responsibility initiatives began as a defensive
reaction to societal pressures to become better corporate citizens, but has evolved to become a more proactive
approach by managers. This evolution has given rise to the sustainable entrepreneurship management concept
(Weidinger, Fischler, & Schmidpeter, 2014):
The term “Sustainable Entrepreneurship” recently emerged in the business world to describe this
latest very entrepreneurial and business-driven view on business and society. Current definitions
for Sustainable Entrepreneurship focus on new solutions or sustainable innovations that aim at
the mass market and provide value to society. Entrepreneurs or individuals or companies that are
sustainability-driven within their core business and contribute towards a sustainable development
can be called sustainable entrepreneurs, according to Schaltegger and Wagner (2011). Others
argue that sustainable entrepreneurship stands for a unique concept of sustainable business
strategies that focuses on increasing social as well as business value – shared value (Porter and
Kramer 2011) – at the same time (Weidinger et al., 2014, p. 1).

Chapter 9 – Innovation and Entrepreneurship

While the idea of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship has evolved to include the attributes of innovation,
opportunity discovery (or construction) and value creation, my sense of the basic gist of the term continues to
focus on this facet of human behavior: initiative taking. The process of entrepreneurship invariably involves
an individual or individuals investing effort into something they had not previously done before. – Fayolle
(2007, p. ix)

Overview
This chapter introduces the building blocks for both innovation and successful entrepreneurship while describing
how innovation and entrepreneurship are interrelated concepts. It continues with a discussion about
competencies—and specifically core competencies—as necessary building blocks for both innovation and
successful entrepreneurship. The elements of innovation are also discussed.

Innovation and Entrepreneurship
The concepts of innovation and entrepreneurship are undeniably interrelated:
Innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as
an opportunity for a different business or a different service. It is capable of being presented

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 94

as a discipline, capable of being learned, capable of being practiced. Entrepreneurs need to
search purposefully for the sources of innovation, the changes and their symptoms that indicate
opportunities for successful innovation. And they need to know and to apply the principles of
successful innovation (Drucker, 1985, p. 19).
Drucker (1985) argued that innovation should be viewed as an economic or social phenomenon rather than
a technological term. Innovation is not about making new inventions, but rather about recognizing how to
take advantage of opportunities and changes: “Systematic innovation therefore consists in the purposeful and
organized search for changes, and in the systematic analysis of the opportunities such changes might offer for
economic or social innovation” (p. 35). This is consistent with Schumpeter’s (1934) view that innovation arises
from new combinations of materials and forces.
To better understand the interrelationship between innovation and entrepreneurship, we will consider some of the
building blocks for both innovation and successful entrepreneurship.
Competencies and Core Competence
Competencies are the necessary ingredients for entrepreneurial competence:
Individual competencies are the combination of learnable behaviors that encompass attitudes (wanting
to do), skills (how to do), knowledge (what to do), practical experiences (proven learning), and natural
talents of a person in order to effectively accomplish an explicit goal within a specific context.
Collective competencies are the synergistic combination of the individual competencies of team members
within organizations. There is a continuum that exists from low-functioning teams to high-functioning
teams. High-functioning teams, although very rare, are those that apply collective competencies the most
effectively (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 10).
Core competencies are those that are collectively held and that include “the learnable behaviors the entire
organization must practice in order to achieve competence in relation to the organization’s purpose and its
competitive environment. A core competency encompasses the knowledge, skills, and technology that create
unique customer value” (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 11):
Organizations need to identify what core competencies they need to cultivate in their precious human
resources in order to meet a competence level that rises above the competition. The three tests to identify
a core competence are:
1. First, a core competence provides potential access to a wide variety of markets.
2. Second a core competence should make a significant contribution to the perceived benefit of the end
product.
3. Finally a core competence should be difficult for competitors to imitate (Matthews & Brueggemann,
2015, p. 12).

95 • LEE A. SWANSON

Entrepreneurs must assess their and their organization’s individual competencies to better understand how to fill
competency gaps and build collective and core competencies.
Elements of Innovation
Matthews and Brueggemann (2015) identified the following 12 elements of innovation. They argued that
innovation is best understood by first examining each of the following elements.
Innovation Degrees
Incremental innovations are small-scale improvements on what is already being done, often with the intention
to improve efficiencies to reduce costs, or improve products or services offered: “Both Six Sigma and Lean
are well-regarded managerial quality improvement programs that explicitly target the removal of many types
of organizational waste and variability…. An incremental innovation can be used to differentiate products for
marketing purposes” (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 34).
Evolutionary innovations involve doing new things for existing customers and markets, and also doing things that
extend product offerings to new customers and new markets (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015).
Revolutionary innovations are when businesses pursue new products, businesses, customers, and markets. The
impacts from these types of innovations can be much higher than from either incremental or evolutionary
innovations (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015).
Innovation Types
There are many types of innovations. “Organizing innovation into types makes it is easier to understand how
you can use multiple types of innovation simultaneously. The fundamental innovation types include products,
customer experiences, solutions, systems, processes, and business and managerial models” (Matthews &
Brueggemann, 2015, p. 37). Matthews and Brueggemann (2015) combined the innovation degrees with the
innovation types to develop The Innovation Matrix.
Innovation Direction
Innovation direction is a concept that encompasses forward and reverse innovation. Innovation
direction is a notion that is based on the source and target of the innovation. A forward innovation
would have its source in country X and the target in country X. A reverse innovation would have
its source in country Y and later targeted to a different country such as country X. Country X or
Y could be a developed or developing country (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 40).
Innovation Risk
The entrepreneurial ecosystem described earlier in this book indicated that individuals, firms, and organizations
are interconnected in ways that impact each other. According to Matthews and Brueggemann (2015), coinnovation risk occurs when multiple actors in the ecosystem attempt to innovate, which leads to the possibility

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 96

that a new innovation developed by one company is ready at a different time than a dependent second innovation
developed by another firm. For example, it can be disastrous for a computer hardware company to release a new
product that is dependent upon new software if the company developing that software does not make it available
on time.
Adoption chain risk also occurs when multiple firms in the value chain are simultaneously developing new
products and services. If one firm, for example, releases a product that must be serviced by a different company
before that other company is prepared to offer that service, the product release can fail (Matthews &
Brueggemann, 2015).
Innovation Principles and Tenets
Both non-profit and for-profit organizations are governed by principles that dictate how they operate. Non-profits
often strive to alleviate social problems while for-profits attempt to satisfy the desires of their shareholders.
An increasing number of organizations are adopting alternative measures of performance that include not only
economic outcomes, but also social and environmentally responsible results: a triple bottom line (Kneiding &
Tracey, 2009). This can—and should—lead to organizations redefining themselves as pursuing the creation of
shared value rather than just profits (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015; Porter & Kramer, 2011):
Companies must take the lead in bringing business and society back together. The recognition
is there among sophisticated business and thought leaders, and promising elements of a new
model are emerging. Yet we still lack an overall framework for guiding these efforts, and most
companies remain stuck in a “social responsibility” mindset in which societal issues are at the
periphery, not the core.
The solution lies in the principle of shared value, which involves creating economic value in
a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges. Businesses
must reconnect company success with social progress. Shared value is not social responsibility,
philanthropy, or even sustainability, but a new way to achieve economic success. It is not on the
margin of what companies do but at the center. We believe that it can give rise to the next major
transformation of business thinking. …
The purpose of the corporation must be redefined as creating shared value, not just profit per se.
This will drive the next wave of innovation and productivity growth in the global economy. It will
also reshape capitalism and its relationship to society. Perhaps most important of all, learning how
to create shared value is our best chance to legitimize business again (Porter & Kramer, 2011, p.
4).
Innovation Thresholds
Organizations should strive to achieve their innovation threshold:

97 • LEE A. SWANSON

An innovation threshold is a marker that each business sector needs to achieve in order to be
competitive. To thrive, an organization cannot under-innovate, while over-innovation would be
wasteful and ineffectual. Innovation thresholds range from low to high, and are different for each
business sector. Once an organization achieves the innovation threshold, additional innovation
may not matter (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 52).
After achieving their innovation threshold such that more innovation might not generate enough extra value
to make the effort worthwhile, organizations must rely on other innovation competencies. For example, some
industries like insurance and airlines have a relatively low product innovation threshold, so after reaching it they
must rely on other forms of innovation and entrepreneurship competencies “such as creativity, culture, strategy,
leadership, and technology” (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 53) to further advance their goals. Higher
technology fields normally have higher product innovation thresholds and can gain much by striving for more
product innovations.
Innovation Criteria
Matthews and Bruggemann (2015) argue that a design should be judged based on its desirability, feasibility, and
viability: “An innovative design needs to be desirable, feasible, and aligned with a sustainable business model”
(Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 53).
Innovation Processes
Another element of innovation is the set of planned innovation processes that are required to make innovation
happen. These processes must balance the need to provide customers with what they want with what is
technologically feasible and financially viable. One example of an innovation process is design thinking.
Innovation Diffusion
Lundblad (2003) defined diffusion of innovation as “the adoption and implementation of new ideas, processes,
products, or services” as she studied the diffusion of innovation “within and across organizations” (p. 51). This
concept is particularly important because many sectors of the economy strive for organizational improvement, but
“innovations often are not diffused within and across organizations to achieve improvement” (p. 51). To illustrate
her point, she described how research in the healthcare sector has led to the development of new advancements
in clinical practice and process improvements, yet—despite the relatively low cost to implement many of these
process innovations—it often takes many years before these improvements are adopted into practice, if they ever
are. This means that often there is a gap between when an innovation is developed and when it is implemented in
practice.
The Theory of the Diffusion of Innovation can help us understand what we must do in terms of implementing steps
and processes for innovations to be diffused into the areas of practice where they are needed. There are four main
elements of the theory.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 98

The first element of the theory is the innovation itself, whether that be an idea, a product, a process, or something
else that is new to the potential adopters. The theory says that there are several characteristics of the innovation
that affect its rate of adoption, including its complexity and its compatibility with whatever it will be connected
within some manner (Lundblad, 2003).
The second element is communication, specifically the processes used by people to share the information needed
to develop a common understanding. The rate of adoption will depend upon the sources of communication, even
more so than the technical information contained in the messages (Lundblad, 2003).
Time is the third element of the theory. According to Rogers (2003), who developed the Theory of the Diffusion of
Innovation, three considerations are related to the time element. The first is the innovation-decision process that
describes the gap in time between when a potential early adopter learns about an innovation and either adopts it or
doesn’t. There are several stages that the potential adopter goes through during this time frame. Second, Rogers
(2003) classified potential adopters as “innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards”
(Lundblad, 2003, p. 54) based upon how early they were likely to adopt an innovation. Finally, the rate of adoption
describes how quickly the innovation is adopted. As Lundblad (2003) noted,
Innovation adoption tends to follow an S-shaped curve, meaning that only a few individuals
initially adopt the innovation; but as time moves on and more and more individuals adopt, the rate
increases. Eventually, though, the adoption rate levels off and begins to decline. (p. 54)
The final element of the theory is social system. Rogers (2003) said that diffusion of innovation occurs within a
social system, which might be somewhat limited, like the members of an organization, or widespread, like all of
the consumers in a country. Some members within a social system, such as “opinion leaders, change agents, and
champions” (Lundblad, 2003, p. 55), influence others.
Innovation Pacing
Innovation pacing refers to the speed with which an organization delivers innovations, and how that impacts its
ability to compete: “Pacing is influenced by your innovation capability and the ability of your customers to adopt
those innovations” (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 60).
Innovation Value
Red ocean strategies focus on competing with other players for market share within industries that currently
exist. This type of thinking can be a constraint if it restricts organizations’ abilities to adapt to change and to
figure out ways to pursue blue ocean strategies, namely entirely new markets, business models, industries, and
other opportunities that others have not yet been conceptualized or pursued. Blue ocean strategies are not about
competing with others; they are about rendering competitors irrelevant because they are not playing in the same
field as your organization, and, more importantly, they are not matching the value that you create for customers in
the new market that you opened up: “Value without innovation is an improvement that may not be sufficient for
organic growth. Innovation without value does not provide the utility that customers would be willing to purchase.

99 • LEE A. SWANSON

Innovation needs to be aligned with value comprised of utility, price, and cost” (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015,
p. 62).
Disruptive Innovation
The last element is disruptive innovation:
Disruptive innovations are different than incremental, evolutionary, and revolutionary innovation
degrees. A disruptive innovation is not a revolutionary innovation that makes other innovations,
such as products and services, better. Rather, a disruptive innovation transforms any type of
innovation that historically was expensive and complicated into an innovation that is affordable,
simple, and available to broader markets (Matthews & Brueggemann, 2015, p. 63).

Chapter 10 – The Entrepreneurial Environment

Entrepreneurs adopt the ways of the adept and adapt to a changing environment. Actually, entrepreneurs are
more entrepreneurs, because they are forever entering into new territory. – Jarod Kintz
Entrepreneurship rests on a theory of economy and society. The theory sees change as normal and indeed
as healthy. And it sees the major task in society—and especially in the economy—as doing something
different rather than doing better what is already being done. That is basically what Say, two hundred years
ago, meant when he coined the term entrepreneur. It was intended as a manifesto and as a declaration of
dissent: the entrepreneur upsets and disorganizes. As Joseph Schumpeter formulated it, his task is “creative
destruction. – Peter Drucker

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter you will be able to
• Explain what an entrepreneurial ecosystem is as a form of complex adaptive system while
explaining its relevance to the study of entrepreneurship
• Describe various entrepreneurship concepts, such as intrapreneurship and social
entrepreneurship, while explaining their relevance to the study of entrepreneurship

Overview
In this chapter several entrepreneurship topics are introduced, including: entrepreneurial ecosystems,
intrapreneurship, social entrepreneurship, Indigenous entrepreneurship, community-based entrepreneurship, and
family business. This overview of just a few of the branches of entrepreneurship thought and research is
intended to provide the reader with an idea of the breadth of this field of study. There are many other categories
of entrepreneurship, from women entrepreneurs to technology entrepreneurs, which provide interesting and
important study topics.

101 • LEE A. SWANSON

The Entrepreneurial Environment
Entrepreneurial Ecosystems
An entrepreneurial ecosystem might be viewed as a complex adaptive system that can be compared to a natural
ecosystem, like a forest. This complexity theory perspective can help us better understand the nature of an
entrepreneurial ecosystem.
A forest is a complex adaptive system made up of many, many different elements, including the plants and animals
that live in it or otherwise influence how it works. Those many different elements behave autonomously from
each other in most ways; but as they do what is necessary to ensure their own survival—and as they attempt to
thrive—the end result of their collective behaviours is a forest that exists in a somewhat stable state of being.
The forest is in a somewhat stable state because it is ever evolving and changing to some degree as variables
change. Changing variables include new insect species that move in and out, new plants that try to establish roots
there, and similar changes that regularly happen to cause some change, but that don’t necessarily change the
fundamental nature of the forest.
Sometimes, however, a parameter change occurs when something more substantial happens, like a forest fire.
When a fire burns down the plants and chases many of the animals away, the forest fundamentally changes to a
very different state (the change from the first state to a new and very different one is called bifurcation).
An entrepreneurial ecosystem is similar in that the nature of entrepreneurship—thriving or not—across a
geographic region remains in a somewhat stable state of being even though it is made up of a complex network
of independent elements that continually adapt to the organizational environments in which they operate; it is a
complex adaptive system. The variable changes, including new leaders that replace the old ones, new rules and
regulations, and entrepreneurial support systems that come and go do not necessarily change the fundamental
nature of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (although the residents of the region might actually want substantial
change leading to a more vibrant economic situation). A parameter change, however, might cause a bifurcation
that leaves the system in a very different state—maybe one where entrepreneurship thrives and prosperity prevails
much more than it did before. The introduction of a major new project that, in turn, spawns new spin-off
businesses and gives the region a needed economic boost, and maybe even leaves it with a new entrepreneurial
culture, is an example of a parameter change.
In a more formal sense, an entrepreneurial ecosystem can be described as
a set of interconnected entrepreneurial actors (both potential and existing), entrepreneurial
organisations (e.g. firms, venture capitalists, business angels, banks), institutions (universities,
public sector agencies, financial bodies) and entrepreneurial processes (e.g. the business birth
rate, numbers of high growth firms, levels of ‘blockbuster entrepreneurship’, number of serial
entrepreneurs, degree of sell-out mentality within firms and levels of entrepreneurial ambition)
which formally and informally coalesce to connect, mediate and govern the performance within
the local entrepreneurial environment (Mason & Brown, 2014, p. 5).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 102

Definitions of entrepreneurial ecosystems can include the suppliers, customers and others that any particular
firm in that ecosystem directly interacts with as well as other individuals, firms, and organizations that the firm
might not directly interact with, but that play a role in shaping the ecosystem. While framing it as an innovation
ecosystem rather than an entrepreneurial ecosystem, Matthews and Brueggemann (2015) described an internal
ecosystem as a company’s activities that are independent of other companies and an external ecosystem that
includes all of the other actors that the company is dependent upon in some way.
While some researchers have studied how entrepreneurial ecosystems can generate geographic clusters of
technology-based ventures, like in Silicon Valley (Cohen, 2006) or how these ecosystems can facilitate growth
in entrepreneurship in cities and similarly defined regions (Neck, Meyer, Cohen, & Corbett, 2004), Mason and
Brown (2014) suggest that even traditional industries can “provide the platform to create dynamic, high-valueadded entrepreneurial ecosystems” (p. 19).

Types of Entrepreneurship
Intrapreneurship
According to Martiarena (2013) “the recognition of intrapreneurial activities has widened the notion of
entrepreneurship by incorporating entrepreneurial activities undertaken within established organisations to the
usual view of entrepreneurship as new independent business creation.” (p. 27). Intrapreneurship, then, is a form
of entrepreneurship that occurs within existing organizations, but intrapreneurs are generally considered to be
“significantly more risk-averse than entrepreneurs, earn lower incomes, perceive less business opportunities in the
short term and do not consider that they have enough skills to succeed in setting up a business” (Martiarena, 2013,
p. 33).
Merriam-Webster (n.d.) defines an intrepreneur as “a corporate executive who develops new enterprises within
the corporation” (Intrapreneur, n.d.); however some might consider some employees who are not corporate
executives to also be intrapreneurs if they demonstrate entrepreneurial behaviour within the company they work
for.
Social Entrepreneurship
Social entrepreneurship involves employing the principles of entrepreneurship to create organizations that address
social issues.
Martin and Osberg (2007) defined a social entrepreneur as an individual who
targets an unfortunate but stable equilibrium that causes the neglect, marginalization, or suffering
of a segment of humanity; who brings to bear on this situation his or her inspiration, direct action,
creativity, courage, and fortitude; and who aims for and ultimately affects the establishment of a
new stable equilibrium that secures permanent benefit for the targeted group and society at large.
(p. 39)

103 • LEE A. SWANSON

Martin and Osberg’s (2007) definition encompasses for-profit and not-for-profit organizations created by these
entrepreneurs and also some government initiatives, but it excludes entities that exist solely to provide social
services and groups formed to engage in social activism.
An idealized definition of social entrepreneurship developed by Dees (2001) is informative in that it supports
Martin and Osberg’s (2007) definition while complementing it with a set of criteria against which organizations
can be assessed to determine whether they are socially entrepreneurial.
Social entrepreneurs play the role of change agents in the social sector, by
• adopting a mission to create and sustain social value (not just private value)
• recognizing and relentlessly pursuing new opportunities to serve that mission
• engaging in a process of continuous innovation, adaptation, and learning
• acting boldly without being limited by resources currently in hand
• exhibiting heightened accountability to the constituencies served and for the outcomes created (Dees,
2001, p. 4)
Social entrepreneurs “use their skills not only to create profitable business ventures, but also to achieve social
and environmental goals for the common good” (Zimmerer & Scarborough, 2008, p. 25). They are “people who
start businesses so that they can create innovative solutions to society’s most vexing problems, see themselves as
change agents for society” (Scarborough, Wilson, & Zimmer, 2009, p. 745).
Social entrepreneurship
• addresses social problems or needs that are unmet by private markets or governments
• is motivated primarily by social benefit
• generally works with—not against—market forces (Brooks, 2009, p. 4)
A social entrepreneur might
• start a new product or service
• expand an existing product or service
• expand an existing activity for a new group of people
• expand an existing activity to a new geographic area
• merge with an existing business (Brooks, 2009, p. 8)
What social entrepreneurship is not: it is not anti-business:
• Many social entrepreneurs came from the commercial business world.
• Sometimes commercial and nonprofit missions align for mutual benefit.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 104

• The difference between it and commercial entrepreneurship is not greed.
• There is no evidence commercial entrepreneurs are especially greedy—they are more likely to be goalobsessed than money-obsessed.
• Social entrepreneurs are also commercial entrepreneurs.
• Social entrepreneurs do not only run non-profits.
• Social entrepreneurship can occur in any sector and with any legal status. (Brooks, 2009, pp. 16-17)
The social entrepreneurship zone:

Aboriginal (Indigenous) Entrepreneurship
Swanson and Zhang (2014) described a range of perspectives on what Indigenous entrepreneurship means and
what implications it holds for social and economic development for Indigenous people.
Indigenous entrepreneurship might simply be entrepreneurship carried out by Indigenous people (Peredo &
Anderson, 2006), but it can also refer to the common situation where Indigenous entrepreneurs—sometimes
through community-based enterprises—start businesses that are largely intended to preserve and promote their
culture and values (Anderson, Dana, & Dana, 2006; Christie & Honig, 2006; Swanson & Zhang, 2011). Dana and
Anderson (2007) expanded upon that notion when they described Indigenous entrepreneurship as follows:

105 • LEE A. SWANSON

There is rich heterogeneity among Indigenous peoples, and some of their cultural values are often
incompatible with the basic assumptions of mainstream theories. Indigenous entrepreneurship
often has non-economic explanatory variables. Some Indigenous communities’ economies
display elements of egalitarianism, sharing and communal activity. Indigenous entrepreneurship
is usually environmentally sustainable; this often allows Indigenous people to rely on immediate
available resources and, consequently, work in Indigenous communities is often irregular. Social
organization among Indigenous peoples is often based on kinship ties, not necessarily created in
response to market needs. (p. 601)
Lindsay (2005) described Indigenous entrepreneurship as something even more complex:
Significant cultural pressures are placed on Indigenous entrepreneurs. These pressures will
manifest themselves in new venture creation and development behavior that involve the
community at a range of levels that contribute toward self-determination while incorporating
heritage, and where cultural values are an inextricable part of the very fabric of these ventures.
Thus, the Indigenous “team” involved in new venture creation and development may involve
not only the entrepreneur and the business’ entrepreneurial team but also the entrepreneur’s
family, extended family, and/or the community. Thus, in Indigenous businesses, there are more
stakeholders involved than with non-Indigenous businesses. For this reason, Indigenous
businesses can be regarded as more complex than non-Indigenous businesses and this complexity
needs to be reflected in defining entrepreneurship from an Indigenous perspective. (p. 2)
Community-Based Enterprises and Community-Based Entrepreneurship
Peredo and Chrisman (2006) described community-based enterprises (CBEs) as emerging from “a process in
which the community acts entrepreneurially to create and operate a new enterprise embedded in its existing
social structure” (p. 310). CBEs emerge when a community works collaboratively to “create or identify a market
opportunity and organize themselves in order to respond to it” (p. 315). These ventures “are managed and
governed to pursue the economic and social goals of a community in a manner that is meant to yield sustainable
individual and group benefits over the short and long term” (p. 310). CBEs are positioned in a sector of the
economy that is not dominated by a profit motive, often because there is little profit to be made, or by government.
As illustrated in the next paragraphs, they also serve what we can refer to as the social commons.
Modern societies are comprised of three distinct, but overlapping sectors (Mook, Quarter, & Richmond, 2007;
Quarter, Mook, & Armstrong, 2009; Quarter, Mook, & Ryan, 2010). Businesses operating in the private sector
primarily strive to generate profits for their owners by providing goods and services in response to market
demands. “While this sector provides jobs, innovation, and overall wealth, it is not suited to addressing most
social problems because there is usually no profit to be made by doing so” (Swanson & Zhang, 2012, p. 177). The
public sector redistributes the money it collects in taxes to provide public goods and to serve needs not met by
the private sector. “While this sector provides defence, public safety, education and a range of other public needs
and social services, it has limited capacity to recognize and solve all social needs” (Swanson & Zhang, 2012,
p. 177). The remaining sector—referred to by a variety of names including the third sector, the citizens’ sector,

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 106

the voluntary sector, the non-profit sector, and more recently by Mintzberg, the plural sector (Mintzberg, 2013;
Mintzberg & Azevedo, 2012)—is comprised of organizations that deliver goods and services the other sectors do
not provide and are either owned by their members (with limited or no potential for individuals or small groups
to gain a controlling interest in the organization) or not owned by any individuals, governments, businesses, other
organizations, or any particular entity at all.
Bollier (2002) used the term the commons to distinguish the collaborative community-based concern for particular
kinds of resources from the management interests in resources assumed by the markets and governments. He
pointed out that “people have interests apart from those of government and markets” (p. 12). One of his categories
of the commons is the social commons, which involves “pursuing a shared mission as a social or civic organism”
(p. 12). The social commons is comprised of community members who contribute energy and resources as they
work together to create value.
Scholars have studied CBEs’ role in promoting socio-economic development in developing countries (Manyara &
Jones, 2007; Torri, 2010) and some have conceptualized Indigenous entrepreneurship as based on a communitybased orientation (Kerins & Jordan, 2010; Peredo & Anderson, 2006; Peredo, Anderson, Galbraith, Honig, &
Dana, 2004). Social enterprises are sometimes considered to be a form of CBE (Leadbeater, 1997); however,
Somerville and McElwee (2011) interpreted Peredo and Chrisman’s (2006) work to mean that a CBE is “a
special kind of community enterprise where the community itself is the enterprise and is also the entrepreneur.
Consequently, a CBE is an enterprise whose social base (the social structure of the community) lies in the CBE
itself” (Somerville & McElwee, 2011, p. 320). This interpretation might distinguish CBEs from some types of
social enterprises.
Some scholars refer to CBEs as being owned by the community while others indicate they can be owned by
individuals or groups of people on behalf of the communities they serve. Lehman and Lento (1992) referred to
“owners and managers” (p. 70) of CBEs when they argued that the value generated by these types of enterprises
often benefit neighbouring residents and businesses more so than the direct owners.
While CBEs in the form of cooperatives have proven to be both prominent and resilient in many parts of
the world (Birchall & Hammond Ketilson, 2009), there are also other forms of community-based or mutually
owned enterprises as described by Woodin, Crook, and Carpentier (2010). They identified five general models of
community-based or mutual ownership while explaining that new models continue to develop.
CBEs involved with housing developments, energy production initiatives, financial services, retail and wholesale
trade, health care and social services, education, and other types of activities is relatively well documented
(Woodin et al., 2010). There are also examples of symphony orchestras (Boyle, 2003) and other arts organizations
that are community-based, sometimes through direct community ownership. Examples of community-owned
sports franchises in Canada include the Saskatchewan Roughriders (Saskatchewan Roughrider Football Club Inc.,
2012), Edmonton Eskimos (Edmonton Eskimos, 2011), and Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Winnipeg Blue Bombers,
2012) of the Canadian Football League. The Green Bay Packers, a professional American football team in the
United States is also community-owned (Green Bay Packers, 2012). In the association football (soccer) world,

107 • LEE A. SWANSON

the Victoria Highlanders’ F. C. (Dheensaw, 2011) and F. C. Barcelona (Schoenfeld, 2000) are examples of
community-owned teams.
The Role of Community-Based Enterprises
According to Gates (1999), the free enterprise system that has dominated the economic landscape of many
developed countries since the end of the Cold War has often proven to be insensitive to the needs of communities.
“The result is to endanger sustainability across five overlapping domains: fiscal, constitutional, civil, social
and environmental” (p. 437). He suggested that the policy environment should be adjusted to encourage more
connection between people and the results from the investments they make. With a revised capitalist goal to
improve societal well-being rather than the current imperative to maximize financial returns with little or no
regard for the associated public outcomes, the current and growing divide between our richest and poorest should
narrow and we should end up with a more sustainable economic system.
Gates (1999) suggested that one approach to establishing a closer connection between people and the effects from
their investments is to re-engineer capitalism in a way that encourages a shift in ownership types toward more
members of society directly and collectively owning elements of the organizations that affect their lives through
the social, environmental, and other impacts they have. CBEs appear to be one form of organization that can fulfill
part of the role advocated by Gates (1999).
Community context plays an important role in how entrepreneurial processes evolve and in their resulting
outcomes. According to Hindle (2010), to understand the community context requires an “examination of the
nature and interrelationship of three generic institutional components of any community: physical resources,
human resources and property rights, and three generic human factors: human resources, social networks and
the ability to span boundaries” (p. 599). When communities face social and economic challenges, some are able
to mobilize physical and human resources, particularly when these communities “are rich in social capital and
are able to learn from collective experiences” (Ring, Peredo, & Chrisman, 2010, p. 5). Communities within this
context are often equipped to identify opportunities and capitalize on them. This can give rise to CBEs that can
contribute to capacity building in their communities (Peredo & Chrisman, 2006).
Community Capacity Building through Community-Based Enterprises
Similar to entrepreneurial capacity in that it refers to evaluating and capitalizing upon the potential to create
value (Hindle, 2007), community capacity “is the interaction of human capital, organizational resources, and
social capital existing within a given community that can be leveraged to solve collective problems and improve
or maintain the well-being of a given community” (Chaskin, 2001, p. 295). Borch et al. (2008) indicated that
CBEs play a community-capacity-building role when they mobilize physical, financial, organizational and human
resources. Their role in organizing “voluntary efforts and other non-market resources” (p. 120) is also of particular
importance in this regard.
Economists have generally suggested that for-profit, privately held organizations occupy different market
segments than publicly funded and community-based organizations. For-profit entities normally seek markets that
are easiest to access and profit from, but their activities in these markets do not necessarily generate social return

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION TOOLKIT • 108

beyond that provided by increased employment and the services that are funded by the taxes they pay. On the other
hand, publicly funded and community-based organizations generally serve a different market segment focused on
generating some sort of social return (Abzug & Webb, 1999).
For-profit entities are usually subject to significant influence from the suppliers of the capital used to support the
organization’s operations. Sometimes these supply-side stakeholders have little interest in the service or product
delivered provided that it generates an adequate financial return for them. CBEs and not-for-profit organizations
primarily answer to demand-side stakeholders who might use the products or services these organizations deliver
or who will benefit from their provision. This can mean that CBEs play an important role in building community
capacity when their demand-side stakeholders turn to them when “for-profit organizations fail to provide products
and services that stakeholders trust; and where they provide insufficient quantity or quality, and government
provision fails to compensate for this market failure” (Abzug & Webb, 1999, p. 421).
One major difference between for-profit and CBEs and not-for-profit organizations is in the distribution of the
accounting profit. Unlike for-profits, CBEs and non-profits generally do not distribute profits to equity holders
and they enjoy some competitive advantages, including tax exemptions and the ability to receive private donations
(Sloan, 2000). Transparency in reporting financial returns is especially important in community-held entities.
These entities must report to a vast group of stakeholders who evaluate the organization’s success based on social
return as well as financial efficiency (De Alwis, 2012).
CBEs can also represent an extension of the private sector that plays an important role in supporting them (Abzug
& Webb, 1999). In the case of the Lloydminster Bobcats, the private sector supported the team by providing
volunteers, advertising dollars, financial resources, and management and board expertise because it believed the
team made the community more attractive. The team provided a form of entertainment that could help attract
private sector employees to the community and retain them after they arrived.
Family Businesses
Chua, Chrisman, and Steier (2003) reported that “family-owned firms account for a large percentage of the
economic activities in the United States and Canada. Estimates run from 40 to 60 percent of the U.S. gross
national product (Neubauer & Lank, 1998), in addition to employment for up to six million Canadians (Deloitte
& Touche, 1999). Their influence is likely even larger elsewhere” (p. 331). Besides the significant component
of Canadian and other economies that are made up of family-owned businesses, these entities might be distinct
from other forms of entrepreneurship in several ways. While more research is required to better understand the
distinctions, family businesses might be characterized by the unique influences family members have on how their
firms operate and by the distinctive challenges they face that make them behave and perform differently than other
categories of businesses (Chua et al., 2003).
One of the unique and most important challenges faced by family businesses is managing succession so that
leadership can be transferred to future generations to preserve family ownership while maintaining family
harmony. This is particularly important as the survival rate of family businesses decline as new generations take
over (Davis & Harveston, 1998).

The Language of Entrepreneurship
Glossary

Effectuation (and effectual reasoning)
Sarasvathy (2001) distinguished between effectuation and causation when examining how entrepreneurs
approached entrepreneurial challenges. He found that the uncertainty surrounding entrepreneurship–particularly
with respect to challenges involving undefined end goals, like how starting a business might turn our relative to
what was originally envisioned–led to what he called effectual reasoning.

Entirepreneur
Bolton and Thompson (2015) coined a new term, entirepreneurs, in response to what they described as today’s
new normal characterized by turbulence and uncertainty in the world. In this environment they claim that success
is not easily achieved by an entrepreneur starting a business, then passing it on to a manager to run who eventually
may need to give way to a strategic leader to ensure the venture’s continuing success (or perhaps to save it from
failing). Entirepreneurs embody the attributes of all of those categories of individuals.
Entirepreneurs successfully combine the attributes we conventionally associate with entrepreneurs, leaders and
managers. They make an all-round contribution. Significantly, they appreciate the needs of different
circumstances and challenges and flexibly adjust their style and approach. Sometimes they behave in a way we
would conventionally describe as entrepreneurial; on other occasions they exhibit conventional leadership; at
other times they are ‘managerial’ (Bolton & Thompson, 2015, p. 24).

Innovation
Innovation is “the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or process, a
new marketing method, or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external
relations” (Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, 2005).

Internal Locus of Control
The term internal locus of control refers to a belief by an individual that they are in control of their own destiny.

Self-Efficacy
Self-efficacy refers to a belief by an individual in their personal capability to be an effective entrepreneur. Selfefficacy is different than self-confidence because self-efficacy is generally based upon past successes that lead to a
heightened belief in abilities whereas an individual might be self-confident even without that confidence resulting
from a history of successes.
