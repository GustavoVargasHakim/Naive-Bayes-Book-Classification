INTRODUCTION

Efficacious educational technology supports, enables, and
facilitates students as they are become full participants in the
computer and network-rich communication landscape of
society. Differences between how IT is provided and managed
in other organizations compared to educational organizations
can pose challenges for school leaders and the IT professional
they hire from other industries. It is through the collaborative
efforts of educators, information technology professionals,
and school leaders that educational technology becomes
efficacious.

In 1993, Seymour Papert imagined two time-traveling
professionals from 100 years earlier; he speculated the physician
would be flummoxed by the activity and the technology in the 20th
century medical clinic, but the teacher would find the activity and
the technology in a 20th century classroom very familiar. Papert
based his speculations on the degree to which medical practitioners
had adopted and adapted to technological innovations compared to
educational practitioners. In the decades since, we who work in
educational technology have made some progress in creating
schools that would flummox the teacher in Papert’s tale, but the
work is far from complete.
The technicians among us have deployed computers that
connect to servers, switches, routers, and other network devices so
the Internet is available from nearly every corner of nearly every
classroom in nearly every one of our schools. We use sophisticated

Efficacious Educational Technology

software to manage those networks; our networks store and protect
all varieties of data about of students, our curriculum, and our
operations. Further, our networks provide robust and reliable access
to vast information and global interaction through devices that our
schools own and that students, faculty, and staff own and bring to
school. That information technology (IT) infrastructure has not,
however, transformed teaching and learning in a manner that has
been promised by so many advocates. The observation that much
teaching and learning remains as it was prior to the arrival of digital
tools continues to be made by scholars who study teaching and
learning (Luckin, Bligh, Manches, Ainsworth, Crook, & Noss,
2012; OECD, 2015; Tondeur, van Braak, Ertmer, & OttenbreitLeftwich, 2017).
The laggardly rate at which technology has changed what
happens in classrooms may not be surprising, however. Larry
Cuban, a well-known scholar from Stanford University, studied the
effects of electronic media (radio, television, and movies) on
education earlier in the 20th century and found them to be
inconsequential. He noted, “Claims predicting extraordinary
changes in teacher practice and students’ learning, mixed with
promotional tactics, dominated the literature in the initial wave of
enthusiasm for each new technology” (Cuban, 1986, p. 4), but
observation proved these tools were no better than teachers using
other information technology at conveying information. Something
appears different, however, about the computers and digital
networks we have today compared to earlier media. For the most
part, earlier electronic media did not become as widely used for
official purposes in the way that digital technology has become the
default for legal and governmental communication. Nor did it
become so widely adopted for interaction, nor did it become widely
used for people to create information in the way that digital
technologies have. Previous generations of American citizens
listened to the radio for entertainment as they completed paper
copies of their income tax returns which were mailed to the Internal
Revenue Service. Now, we listen to streaming media and carry on
conversations over text messaging as we complete and file our tax
returns via the Internet. In those areas where IT infrastructure has
been installed it has come to dominate all aspects of economic,
political, social, and cultural life.
The leaders of almost every school face the same
challenging situation: They must create schools that reflect the
2

Efficacious Educational Technology

dominant role of digital IT in society and they must prepare students
for that world; but the changing landscape of teaching, inadequate
technical expertise, and limited resources are genuine barriers to this
work. What we know, how we know it, and what we know about
learning is advancing at a rate that fast outpaces teachers’ capacity
to respond to it. Operating and maintaining the IT systems in schools
requires expertise that is far beyond that of the “tech-savvy”
teachers who managed the first IT systems installed in schools. IT
professionals who are “imported” into education from other
businesses and industries often find the practices, assumptions, and
expectations that served them well in other settings do not transfer
into education. Teachers and students are different from other
workers, and the IT (including the hardware, the software
configurations, and the personnel) they rely on for their work must
accommodate those differences. IT is also a capital-intensive aspect
of operating schools. Devices and network upgrades can consume
years’ worth of technology budgets in a short time, and the total cost
of ownership of devices places on-going demands on budgets.
Further, technology introduces new and rapidly evolving regulatory
and policy issues into school management.
The situation regarding IT management in many schools is
well-captured by the hypothetical (and sarcastic) Putt’s Law.
According to Archibald Putt, “Technology is dominated by two
types of people: those who understand what they do not manage and
those who manage what they do not understand” (Putt, 2006, p. 7).
Further, Putt articulated a corollary, “Every technical hierarchy, in
time, develops a competence inversion” (p. 7). While these words
are intended to be humorously cynical observations, they do
describe the current state of IT management in schools:
• Technology professionals configure IT systems for students
and teachers, but they are unfamiliar with emerging
technology-rich pedagogy. In Putt’s terms, IT professionals
are managing devices for purposes they do not understand.
• Educators complain about the IT systems in schools, but
they don’t understand the complexity of managing IT
systems, the potential conflicts and threats to the operation
of enterprise IT, and general chaos that can result when
enterprise networks are not tightly controlled. In Putt’s
terms, educators seek to manage IT they do not understand.
3

Efficacious Educational Technology

• School leaders make budget and personnel decisions that
impose unrealistic limits on IT professionals and they
advocate for practices beyond the capacity of the available
IT or are contrary to the professional tendencies of the
teachers.
The schools in which students participate in the digital
world are places in which IT infrastructure is available and
functioning; the existence of this infrastructure is absolutely
dependent on skilled IT professionals to operate and maintain it.
These schools are also absolutely dependent upon skilled educators
who plan and facilitate learning experiences in which all students
access, manipulate, analyze, create, and disseminate information
using the IT. To improve efficacy in these schools, teachers’
critiques of the of the IT they use as well as their requests for new
features must be accommodated by IT professionals because
educators best understand how the IT effects students. Further, these
are schools are absolutely dependent upon school administrators
understand the demands of maintaining IT in an operational state as
well as the emerging needs of teachers. Together; educators, IT
professionals, and school administrators must collaborate for
efficacious technology management in schools.

Efficacious IT Management
Within any organization, leaders define a small number of
strategic goals; these indicate the conditions they seek to make true
and the success of the organization is determined by the degree to
which these goals are accomplished. When an organization achieves
its strategic goals, we recognize the leaders and members have been
efficacious. Throughout this book, I refer to “efficacious IT
managers” which is a group comprising teachers, IT professionals,
and school leaders whose decisions and actions lead to the strategic
goals being realized
Each community defines its own strategic goals, but I fully
expect every reader of this book is associated with (or hopes to
become associated with) a school in which leaders have articulated
a strategic goal such as “Students will fully participate in the
communication life of our society which is dominated by digital
information technologies.” (My choice of words models John
4

Efficacious Educational Technology

Dewey, who is credited with saying “Education is not preparation
for life; education is life itself.” Therefore, the strategic goal is
written to participate in the information life of society, not simply
to prepare students for it.)
This book was written to support school professionals
(educators, technicians, and leaders) as they become efficacious IT
managers. It concerns both the decisions they make and the actions
they take to ensure the information technology infrastructure
installed in schools is useful to teachers as they work with learners
as they become citizens in the emerging digital world. This book is
intended to help IT professionals understand the world of education
and for educators to understand the world of IT.
Because strategic goals are generally too broad to guide
meaningful action, planners define logistic goals. In situations
where the logistic goals are aligned with the strategic goal, there will
exist a positive association between achieving the logistic goals and
achieving the strategic goal. With regards to information technology
in schools, logistic goals must ensure decisions are made and actions
taken to create technology that is appropriate, proper, and
reasonable (see figure 1).
• Teachers (whose who spend their days working directly
with students) steer decision-making processes so that IT
systems are appropriately configured to be useful for the
curriculum they teach, the pedagogical methods they
employ, and the developmental circumstances of their
students.
• IT professionals implement decisions so that IT systems are
properly configured; this ensures the IT is operational, it
functions as expected, and it is secure.
• School administrators govern decision making to ensure IT
systems are reasonably configured and supported to meet
the needs of learners and to reflect local priorities and limits.
Reasonableness is a relative term and it is defined locally;
budgets, existing policy and procedure, and similar factors
affect what is deemed reasonable.

5

Efficacious Educational Technology

A situation I encountered when writing an early draft of this
book serves to illustrate how proper, appropriate, and reasonable

Figure 1. Dimensions of efficacious IT management
configurations of IT can influence teaching and learning. I was
asked to help resolve some “network problems” in a school. Math
teachers had complained that students could not access the online
grade book from the computers provided under the recently begun
one-to-one initiative. It turned out the network administrator had
configured the permissions and switching so that students were
unable to access the online grade book while at school. He reasoned,
“We need to prevent students from trying to ‘hack’ their grades.”
The principal responded, “That seems an insignificant threat, and it
prevents students from tracking their grades when they are here at
school. It is essential they be able to see their grades while in class
with their teachers present” and he directed the network
administrator to reconfigure the network. In this case, the network
administrator properly configured the network (he had successfully
prevented students from accessing the server), but the configuration
was inappropriate (it prevented access to information necessary for
teaching and learning), and it was deemed unreasonable (thus the

6

Efficacious Educational Technology

school administrator who had authority insisted the configuration be
changed).

The Barriers to Efficacy
If information technology is to facilitate realization of the
strategic goal of allowing students to fully participate in the digital
world, then it must be appropriately used, properly configured, and
reasonably supported. Deficiencies in any of these aspects of
technology management threaten the overall efficacy of the IT
managers. To ensure those with expertise in all three aspects of IT
management are involved in planning, decision-making, designing
and implementing interventions, most schools convene technology
planning committees. These groups have made schools that are
physical places rich with screens and connections to online spaces.
Even in those schools served by well-functioning committees,
technology management may not be as efficacious as it could be; it
can be inefficient, ineffective in some areas, and incomplete for
some populations of students. I have come to conclude the root
cause of much inefficacy is lack of shared understanding among the
disparate professionals involved in IT management.
Fundamentally, educators and IT professionals understand
technology different ways. Even steps that seem to be necessary for
reliable and secure computers can be differently perceived and
understood by different groups. Consider complex passwords; IT
professionals perceive them to be a simple method for keeping the
network secure (which they do), but teachers can find them to be an
impediment to quick access, especially for those students with
emerging keyboarding skills. Consider, as well, the example of
operating systems. Installing operating system updates in a timely
manner as an essential step of keeping systems secure, thus reliably
available. Teachers, however, who find their lesson delayed as they
wait for computers to finish installing updates before they can begin
will see them as interfering with the reliability of the machines (of
course updates are becoming less disruptive as school have adopted
Internet-only notebooks). The school administrator who is an
enthusiastic user of his or her tablet for personal and professional
and work may not understand the difficulty of managing those
devices in multi-user environments; this leads IT professionals to
push back against his or her suggestion tablets be purchased for
students.
7

Efficacious Educational Technology

Negotiating what is appropriate, proper, and reasonable is
difficult when the participants in the management decisions
approach the problem from different perspectives, have different
concepts of the same terms, and interpret the same circumstances
differently. Efficacious IT management is also made more difficult
because of the disparate approaches to problems solved by the three
groups who must collaborate for efficacious IT management.
Designing IT systems is a typical tame problem (Rittel &
Weber, 1973); it is well-understood and systems are designed using
known procedures. IT professionals can clearly describe the
networks they seek to build and maintain, and the procedures for
building and troubleshooting computer networks can be transferred
reliably from one design project to another. Further, IT systems can
be tested and redesigned before they are deployed to users.
Teaching, on the other hand, is a wicked problem; it is not clearly
understood, there are multiple and interconnected factors that affect
how its effectiveness is judged, and those factors are incompletely
known. Further, different individuals will judge the same outcomes
differently. Successful teaching depends on learning (which is both
a physiological and a psychological process as well as social one),
and many educators recognize the best teaching does not always
influence learning in the intended manner. School leadership is
largely a political process, so the way it proceeds and the measures
of success are entirely dependent on perceptions, power, and
priorities.
Because of these fundamental differences in their work,
technology professionals, teachers, and school administrators can
find their IT management is affected by the silo effect. For most of
their work hours, these professionals work in separate locations and
they apply different knowledge and skills to the problems and
accomplish the tasks specific to their area of expertise. While
educators, IT professionals, and school leaders all assume
responsibility for effectively and efficiently realizing their logistic
goals, the nature of those goals and their connection to the strategic
goal must be understood collectively if IT management is to be
efficacious.

Becoming Efficacious
The isolating silo effect is also necessary for efficacious IT
management. Few individuals are capable of (or interested in)
8

Efficacious Educational Technology

solving the problems encountered by those in the other groups, so
multiple individuals comprise efficacious technology planning
teams. The IT we install is vastly more complex than the first
computers that arrived in schools; without highly skilled
technicians, our digital networks will fail. Teaching is far more
complex than it was previously; we have more to teach, more
cognitive tools that must be accommodated, and we teach brains that
are profoundly affected by the IT which defines their world both in
and out of our classrooms. The skills and knowledge and habits of
mind necessary to negotiate this dynamic milieu of technology and
ideas does not exist in any one person. Efficacious IT management,
we can conclude, requires collaboration.
For teachers, IT professionals, and school leaders to make
decisions and take actions that build effective digital learning
environments, they must build a common language and
understanding of the nature of the problems and how acceptable
solutions will be recognized. When school IT managers share
understanding of what needs to be done, what everyone can expect
to see when it is done, and how they should approach the work, they
will be more successful in achieving strategic goals.
Through this book, I seek to support those who are
interested in generating common language, understanding, and
actions so that communities realize the goal of creating and
sustaining schools that are places and spaces for digital learning. I
define the context in which educational technology is used, the
dimensions of educational technology, and the processes that can
facilitate this collaboration. My work is grounded in assumptions
about the users of IT in educational institutions and it recognizes the
role of theory in IT management.

My Assumptions About Users of School IT
The education and experience that prepares IT professionals
to properly configure IT infrastructure in schools is unlike the
professional preparation of educators. To earn teaching credentials,
educators must complete undergraduate and graduate programs at
accredited institutions of higher education, pass tests, and meet other
requirements specified by the regulatory agencies that grant
teaching licenses.
The government oversight that marks educator licensing is
not required for those who work with IT systems in schools. IT
9

Efficacious Educational Technology

professionals become qualified to enter the field in two ways. First,
they earn degrees from colleges and universities. Second, they pass
exams created by professional organizations and companies that
build and sell hardware and software. Interestingly, these two are
not coincident. Consider an individual who earns an undergraduate
degree in information systems. The graduate will have taken courses
in network management, network security, databases, and other
aspects of IT systems. Those courses are likely to be vendorindependent, so students learn the theory and practice of IT
management common to all information systems. Cisco, the
manufacturer of networking devices, certifies individuals who pass
the exams they publish can properly configure the devices they sell,
but make no claims about their other skills. The information systems
graduates may be unable to pass a Cisco exam, but the degree
program was not intended to prepare students for those tests.
Because the contents of the tests are very specific, one may be able
to pass a Cisco exam without holding a degree. Both individuals,
however, may be qualified to properly configure IT systems in
schools, but neither the undergraduate degree nor the Cisco exams
address the needs of users in educational organizations.
IT professionals who arrive in schools are likely, also, to
have experience working in fields other than education. While the
steps needed to properly configure IT networks are the same
regardless of the nature of the users, the appropriate configuration
does depend on the nature of the users. The differences between
users in schools and users in business are relevant to the design of
IT systems, and IT professionals may find the configurations that
were proper and appropriate in business are proper but inappropriate
in schools, thus they must reevaluate what they believe to be the best
practices for managing and configuring IT. The differences between
users in business and industry and those in educational organizations
(especially K-12 schools) are based on both the skill levels of the
users and the nature of teaching and learning as information tasks.
These differences are summarized in table 1.
Some users of school IT do resemble users in other
businesses and organizations; for example, in the business office of
any school, there are professionals who manage finances. Those
individuals need access to accounting software, so they can process
invoices and pay bills just as finance professionals in all
organizations. Those individuals will know the task they are
assigned and will have been trained in how to do it. They will do
10

Efficacious Educational Technology

that job daily (with regular and predictable variation such as
completing and distributing tax forms) and indefinitely. The
computer room in an elementary school served by that business
office will be used by students who are early in the process of
learning to read as well as teachers who are working on graduate
courses, so the users of the computer room have much more varied
need.
Teachers are likely to vary their curriculum and instruction
based on the needs of particular students and groups, and those may
not be known until they meet the students and work with them for
several weeks. Perhaps the most important characteristic of school
users is the compulsory nature of being a student. Whereas
11

Efficacious Educational Technology

underperforming business users can separate from the situation, the
professionals responsible for school IT have a legal and moral
obligation to provide appropriate IT environments and experiences
for all students.

The Role of Theory
In the vernacular, “theory” is associated with ideas that are
incomplete or not necessarily true. Among educators, and other
pragmatic professionals such as technologists, theory is often
associated with unrealistic or idealistic thinking that has little
connection to their work. Those interpretations of theory are
unfortunate, however, as theory can inform and focus decisions
made by all who participate in school IT management. It is reasoned
that making decisions and taking actions without addressing theory
leads to inefficient and ineffective decisions and actions.
Grounding decisions and actions in theory allows decision
makers to take advantage of three affordances that make it
particularly useful for efficacious IT management in schools. First,
every theory clearly identifies those factors that are relevant and that
deserve managers’ attention as they design interventions. Even
when professionals are working within their field of expertise, they
often overlook important factors, they dedicate resources to
irrelevant factors, or they accept assumptions that have been
disproven by research. Theory supports the design of interventions
that focus on what matters and only what matters.
Second, theory allows IT managers to predict the changes
that will be observed once decisions are implemented. Coincidently,
theory suggests methods for collecting data that will confirm or
refute those predictions. Although instruments designed to collect
research data may not be appropriate for evaluating interventions in
schools, theory has been elucidated with instruments and methods
that can be can be adapted by IT managers as they seek to evaluate
management decisions and actions in schools.
Third, theory affords explanations. The reason researchers
do their work is to identify and support cause-and-effect
relationships. While it is exceedingly difficult to establish causeand-effect without experimenting (and true randomized doubleblind experiments are unusual in education for a range of factors
including ethical considerations), theory can facilitate our
understanding why IT projects in schools failed or succeeded. If our
12

Efficacious Educational Technology

predictions are accurate, then we explain them in terms of theory. If
our predictions fail, then we use theory to understand what happened
and why. In both cases, theory results in deeper understanding of
our unique situations and the decisions we make and actions we
take.
Several theories and frameworks relevant to IT
management in schools are presented in this book. Educational
technology is a field in which some work can be conducted from an
atheoretical stance. The technician repairing computers has little
concern for theory, but teachers’ actions are informed by theory
(even if it is not articulated). Theory, nevertheless, plays an
important role in how managers undertake their work and in
providing a structure within which technicians, teachers, and all
others who contribute to the technology-rich school function.
Without theory, IT managers are likely to abandon interventions
before they have matured to the point where expected improvements
are widely observed as they are distracted by emerging fads that
promise unreasonable outcomes.
There are two theories have been widely applied to
problems in educational technology and these can be used to explain
and predict many situations and the results of many interventions in
the field. When there appears to be no other theory to inform
decisions and evidence, technology acceptance model and cognitive
load theory can provide insight for IT managers.

Technology Acceptance
Technology acceptance model was first elucidated to
understand the observation “that performance gains are often
obstructed by users' unwillingness to accept and use available
systems” (Davis, 1989 p. 319), and it has been used to study
decisions to use (or avoid) technology in many settings. Variations
of technology acceptance model have been used to develop and
refine both IT systems (hardware and software) and organizational
practices that rely on IT systems. It is used to predict and explain
both how individuals interact with IT as well as patterns of IT use
within groups, and it is used to change perceptions of technology
and patterns of technology use.
In 2003, Venkatesh, Morris, Davis and Davis modified the
TAM into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology
(UTAUT); in this work, the scholars combined eight different
theories that predict the decision to use technology into one model.
13

Efficacious Educational Technology

According to UTAUT, four factors are positively associated with
the use of technology: performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
social influences, and facilitating conditions (see figure 2).
• Performance expectancy is a measure of the extent to which
an individual believes technology will affect his or her job
performance in a positive manner. It is rooted in efficiency,
relative advantage, and outcome expectations. Interventions
that lead to increased efficiency or improved outcomes will
be more used.

Figure 2. Factors directly associated with technology use (adapted
from Venkatesh, Morris, Davis and Davis 2003)
• Effort expectancy is a measure of the individual’s
perceptions of how easy it is to use the technology; users
intend to use systems they perceive to be easy-to-use.
• Social influences are related to the individual’s perceptions
of how others perceive the technology and its use;
technology used by others who opinion is valued will be
more used.
• Facilitating conditions include structures that provide
responsive and effective technical support, adequate
replacement plans, access to necessary training, and other
supports. More and more highly functioning systems that
maintain and provide technology in organizations are
associated with increased use of it.
14

Efficacious Educational Technology

It is notable that these factors are associated with ones’
intention to use a technology are based on each individual’s
perceptions. In a school, different populations and even different
individuals within a population may perceive the same technology
differently, and those differences will affect individuals’ intentions
to use the technology. Efficacious IT managers will use UTAUT as
a theory to explain observed uses of technology and predict
interventions that will change those patterns. Changes can be made
to affect those factors, and failures to observe the expected changes
can be evaluated for either effectiveness or perceptions of the
changes.

Cognitive Load Theory
While technology acceptance is a theory that can explain
and predict the decision to use a technology, cognitive load theory
(Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011) (CLT) predicts and explains
technology use once it has been adopted. CLT is based on the
assumption that using information (and the information
technologies used to communicate it) requires attention, perception,
thought, and memory, thus it is a cognitive activity. Further, human
cognition is a zero-sum quantity; each individual has a limited
quantity of cognition available at any moment, and that cognition
used for one purpose is not available for another purpose.
Theorists identify three types of cognitive load that
characterize an information task:
• Intrinsic cognitive load is that which is necessary to
understand the task and to use the information necessary to
accomplish the task. Changing the task changes the intrinsic
cognitive load, and steps taken to reduce it results in a
different task.
• Germane cognitive load is that which is available for the
learner to think about, strategize about, and come to deeper
understanding of the ideas and information in the task.
Learning occurs only when germane cognitive load is
available and the amount available limits what can be
learned.

15

Efficacious Educational Technology

• Extraneous cognitive load is that which is wasted by the
learners managing bad design or poor organization of
information or information technology tools. Using
unfamiliar tools can also increase extraneous cognitive
load.
When designing the information tasks and the information
technology platforms that are used for teaching and learning,
efficacious IT managers seek to minimize extraneous cognitive load
and maximize germane cognitive load. It is reasoned that changing
the intrinsic cognitive load is accomplished only by changing the
task; therefore, reducing the extraneous cognitive load is the only
method of increasing the cognitive load for germane purposes.
Consider the example of graphing calculators. Using this
technology, one can minimize the extraneous cognitive load of
drawing the graph of a sophisticated function, so more cognition can
be dedicated to understanding the mathematics. When first
encountering a graphing calculator (or when encountering an
unfamiliar model), determining how to use the device increases
extraneous cognitive load of graphing. This explains the practice of
introducing such technology with simple and familiar examples.
Once the technology and its operation along with the manner in
which it displays information becomes familiar, the extraneous
cognitive load of using it decreases, so the advantage of using it for
sophisticated mathematics is realized.
As with all theory, CLT predicts and explains what may be
observed in technology-mediated teaching. Devices may be unused
and procedures may be avoided because they introduce excessive
extraneous cognitive load. It also helps IT managers understand the
changing perceptions of and uses of technologies; as technology
solutions become more familiar (through training and familiarity)
they should become more widely used.

The Organization of My Solution
When writing the book, I sought to answer three questions
about educational technology. “Why do we need to plan for
efficacious IT in schools?” In “Chapter 1: Information Technology,
Society, and Schools,” I answer this by describing the active
influences of computer and related technologies on humans and our
organizations, including schools. My purpose for beginning with
16

Efficacious Educational Technology

this chapter is to establish the context within which strategic goals
must be defined and realized and to establish the complex nature of
technology in schools and the nature of change within human
organizations.
In the next five chapter, I describe the dimension of
educational technology. These comprise those aspects of
educational technology that IT managers must address. The chapters
include: “Chapter 2: Technology-Rich Teaching and Learning,”
“Chapter 3: Access to Sufficient Computing Devices,” “Chapter 4:
IT Networks,” “Chapter 5: Web Services,” and “Chapter 6:
Technology Support Systems.” In these chapters, I answer the
question “What systems must school and technology leaders
create?” The focus of these chapters is largely on information
technology infrastructure and the ancillary systems necessary to
ensure logistic goals are defined to address relevant purposes. While
some IT professionals will find this information insufficient to
provide configuration advice, they will find it helpful to understand
the level of expertise they can reasonably expect school leaders to
demonstrate. Further, it deconstructs the many potential activities of
IT managers so they focus on the essential tasks.
The final two chapters address the question “How should
school and technology leaders approach planning and decisionmaking?” Progressive discourse, which is a model that allows for
(and necessitates) shared understanding and valid evidence, is
described in “Chapter 7: Discourse, Design and Data;” and some
trends and generalization that inform all leadership and management
decisions are considered in “Chapter 8: Understanding Change.”

17

CHAPTER 1: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, SOCIETY, AND SCHOOLS

Information technology exerts strong and active influences on the
humans who experience it. In this chapter, I explore those effects
and describe how they define aspects of economic, political, and
cultural life as well as the schools that reflect those realities.

What we think, how we think, and what types of thinking
we value depend largely on the nature of the information technology
we experience. The effects of information technology on human
cognition are so deep that many are unaware of the degree to which
it affects us, or even that it affects us at all. Scholars refer to such
deeply embedded aspects of civilizations as paradigm mediums.
Brad Mehlenbacher (2010), a scholar at North Carolina State
University, observed, “Once these developments are in place, it
becomes exceedingly difficult to disentangle them from predictions
about the future” (p. 7), and he continues, they “form the very core
of our systems for understanding, conceptualizing and promulgating
knowledge” (p.7). For individuals whose experience is immersed in
these paradigm mediums, they determine what is expected of other
people and what will comprise the environment they perceive to be
natural.
Humans tend to become aware of the effects of paradigm
mediums only during those periods when they change in significant
ways or when they are replaced. The current generation of educators
is working at the historical moment when digital information
consumed on screens is replacing print information consumed on
paper, and we are observing changes cognition and education
similar to those observed throughout history when paradigm
mediums changed. The strategic goals that focus efficacious IT
management in schools will be grounded in emerging paradigm
mediums and intended to allow students to participate in a world
that is dominated by digital information. In this chapter, I explore

Efficacious Educational Technology

the nature of the influences of information technology on society
and its schools. Understanding the nature and extent of these
influences will prepare school IT managers to articulate strategic
and logistic goals that accurately reflect the technology-rich nature
of society.
The role of microcomputers in curriculum and instruction
has been debated since they first arrived in schools; some educators
advocate for quick adoption of every new tool while others advocate
for avoiding digital technology altogether. Disparate perceptions of
emerging information technologies among educators is not a new
phenomenon. In his 2011 book The Information: A History, A
Theory, A Flood, James Gleick noted that Plato criticized those who
sought to teach writing when he observed, “You have invented an
elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils
the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom” (p 30). The wisdom of
Plato did not require writing. Gleick goes on to quote Thomas
Hobbes, the 17th century philosopher, who commented on
preliterate cultures (those that lack writing), “There was no method:
that is to say, no planting of knowledge by itself, apart from weeds
and common plants of error and conjecture” (p. 49). For Hobbes, no
writing meant no wisdom. In the time between Plato and Hobbes,
writing expanded throughout society, it disrupted patterns of
information use, and redefined what it meant to be “educated.” Plato
perceived writing as a degradation of human skills, so he rejected
the emerging information technology and recommended that others
reject it as well. In this, Plato lost. We can predict similar loss for
those who advocate we avoid the technologies emerging today.
We are in the midst of a disruption similar to that caused by
writing, and literacy skills that have been useful for generations are
no longer sufficient. My grandfather graduated from the University
of Vermont in 1939 and I have some of his textbooks on my
bookshelves along with the textbooks I used while an undergraduate
student at the same institution 49 years later. The content of the
textbooks (we both studied biology) is vastly different, but the
literacy skills useful for his books were equally useful for mine
(including our shared habit of writing in our textbooks). While
alternatives to print media have always played a minority role in
curriculum, digital media are increasingly the mode of content, and
are coming to dominate in some content areas. In a 2014 report on
National Public Radio (Kestenbaum, 2014), the growing trend of
publishers replacing printed textbooks with digital versions was
19

Efficacious Educational Technology

detailed. Publishers are motivated by the single use nature of digital
texts; each student who enrolls in a course must purchase access to
digital textbooks whereas students can recycle printed textbooks
until the professor adopts a new one.
The emergence of computers and other digital devices, the
information accessed through them, and the capacity to rapidly
manipulate information using them is challenging deeply held
beliefs about cognition and learning. It is no longer tenable to argue
that technology is marginal to the curriculum, nor is it tenable to use
computers and associated technologies as an add-on to the
curriculum to be used for enrichment purposes. It is only through
using digital technologies to access, manipulate, create, and
disseminate information that students fully participate in 21st
century society. Because this shift from print to digital information
is still incomplete and the technologies are still emerging, strategic
goals for schools will be actively renegotiated to reflect changing
technologies and associated societal expectations into the future.

Information Technology and Society
There can be little question that characteristics of our brains
differentiate humans from other creatures. Increasingly, cognitive
scientists recognize our brains are designed for the social
interactions that have allowed humans to cooperate, and this
cooperation has enabled our species to avoid extinction. Cognitive
and developmental psychologist Michael Tomassello (2014)
described the importance of social interaction for human nature
when he observed, “Humans biologically inherit their basic
capacities for constructing uniquely human cognitive
representations, forms of inference, and self-monitoring, out of their
collaborative and communicative interactions with other social
beings. Absent a social environment, these capacities would wither
away from disuse….” (p. 147). As much as we are a social species,
humans are a technology-using species. It is through technology that
humans have extended their capacity to manipulate and control the
environment. These effects had led scientists to define the
Anthropocene as the era in which humans are changing the world
on a geologic time scale (Waters, Zalasiewicz, Summerhayes,
Barnosky, Gałuszka, & Wolfe, 2016). When using information
technology in the 21st century, humans are both social and
technology-using at once. Through our IT, we interact with people
20

Efficacious Educational Technology

across the globe just as quickly and easily as we can interact with
individuals at the next room. In the next section, I present
information technology as a factor in society that exerts strong and
active influences on individual humans, the organizations we create,
and the cultures that emerge.

The Non-Neutrality of Technology
Human bodies are well-adapted to communicate with other
humans, but that communication is limited. Successful human
communication requires the individuals be close enough to hear or
see each other, they share a language, and the message be
sufficiently noise-free that it can pass between the individuals. If the
spoken message is perceived, then it can enter the recipient’s
memory, resulting in two copies; one in the sender’s brain and one
in the recipient’s brain. We know through experience and
experiment those memories are faulty and fading, which makes
communication incomplete and inconsistent.
Humans have created many technologies to mediate
communication. Our capacity to use sophisticated language allows
humans to encode complex ideas in words, and we have invented
many technologies to encode those words in memory systems that
are more reliable than the human brain. Prior to writing, these
technologies included the repetitive patterns in epic poems,
communal call and response songs and tales, and quipas, which
were knotted strings used by people living in the Andes Mountains
in South America (Wright, 2007). In Western societies, we mark the
beginning of print as the dominant information technology from
Gutenberg and his press in the middle of the 15th century, but
printing presses were in use in Europe and Asia centuries earlier.
The electronic digital computers found on students’ desks (and in
their pockets) are the latest in a long series of devices invented to
encode, store, and transport information in a manner more resilient
and far-reaching than the human brain and body.
Walter Ong studied the effects of information technologies
on societies, and was one of the first to detail the social influences
of information technology. Ong (1982) observed “Writing, print,
and computers are all ways of technologizing the word. Once the
word is technologized, there is no way to criticize what has been
done without the aid of the highest technology possible” p. 80); once
new technologies emerged, they are used to identify the deficiencies
21

Efficacious Educational Technology

of the previous information technology and judge it adversely
compared to the new technology. The conflicts that were noted
when comparing Plato’s and Hobbes’ perceptions of writing as well
as the conflicts we see in classroom as teachers struggle to adapt to
new technologies are examples of those Ong predicts will be
observed when one technology replaces another. He attributed these
conflicts to the social and cognitive effects of the new technologies.
If the new technology caused no changes, Ong reasoned, there
would be no conflict. “Neutral” is the term used to describe things
and actions that do not change the state of a system. Because there
are changes in human cognition and communication that are
associated with information technology, scholars and practitioners
refer to the “non-neutrality of technology” to capture the active
effects of technology on human interactions.
Not all scholars have recognized the non-neutrality of
information technologies, however. For much of the 20th century,
the discoveries necessary to design and develop computer and
information technologies were made by a group of researchers who
perceived technology as a pipeline for accessing information. For
these information theorists, the experience of using information was
the same regardless of the technology used to deliver it. In his
seminal 1945 article “As We May Think,” Vannavar Bush,
suggested computers were going to improve the efficiency of
communication, and he even predicted the invention of the memex
(a device that would operate much as the Internet does), but he did
not predict any changes in how humans learn with the arrival of
digital computers.
More recently, scholars have continued to develop the
concept of non-neutrality of technology and they have added to
Ong’s (1982) observations. The phenomenon can be observed at
three levels. The structure and function of individuals’ brains are
affected by the information technology they experience, especially
though their adolescent years. The characteristics of humans’ social
organizations are affected by information technology; and a
society’s norms are influenced by the nature of the information
technology available.

Effects on People
Brains and the sense organs sending signals into the brains
are used by humans to perceive the world and to react and respond
to it. Neuroscience researchers are elucidating the nature and details
22

Efficacious Educational Technology

of neural changes when we learn, as well as the details of how
memories are recalled. Neuroscience is basic research, so the
discoveries are not immediately useful or relevant to educators
(Antonenko, van Gog, & Paas, 2014), but discoveries are clearly
contributing to educators’ understanding of how the environment
and its information technology influence developing brains.
Neuroscience has confirmed that the brain is somewhat
modular, so different parts of the brain are active when it is
processing different types of information (Antonenko, Paas,
Grabner, & van Gog, 2010). Since the 1990’s, studies have
confirmed the dual coding theory (Clark & Paivio, 1991); this theory
posits information presented as text and information presented as
images is processed in different parts of the brain. There is further
evidence that information presented in video format is processed in
a third area of the brain (Gerě, & Jaušcvec, 1999). There is evidence
that five hours of exposure to information on screens can change the
areas in the brain that are used to process information (Small &
Vorgan, 2008).
In addition to affecting brain structure and function, the
information technology to which one is exposed affects his or her
behavior. Those born since about 1990—those who entered school
about when the World Wide Web arrived in schools—have been
labeled the iGeneration (Rosen, 2010), and those generations have
been widely studied by many research groups (Dijk, 2012;
Montgomery, 2007; Palfrey & Gasser, 2016; Tapscott, 2009). While
each research group attributes slightly different characteristics of
these generations to the influences of digital information, there are
several observations upon which they seem to concur:
• Individuals in these generations have a proclivity to use
digital technology and they consume vast amounts of
media.
• These individuals tend to create content and share details of
their lives online.
• They are heavy users of social media and they use it to
establish and control relationships.
While young people have always consumed large amounts
of media (especially recorded music and television), the tendencies
23

Efficacious Educational Technology

to create digital content and share it over social media along with
the availability of vast amounts of digital content from other
providers is a new aspect of media associated with digital
technologies (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010). The sharing
perceived to be excessive (and disconcerting) by older generations,
but natural by the iGenerations, is conflict that can reasonably be
interpreted as another example of that which Ong (1982) attributed
to the non-neutrality of technology.
It is also clear that individuals in the iGenerations are
actively learning when online, and interests and friendships
motivate this learning. Indeed, Ito and her colleagues (2010)
suggested that youth are developing greater expertise in learning in
the digital landscape than adults. For perhaps the first time in human
history, there is an information technology skill inversion, as
individuals in the younger generations appear to be more skilled
than the older generations in using the dominant information
technology. This leads Ito (2010) to conclude, “Given the centrality
of youth-defined agendas in [interest and friendship-driven
learning], the challenge is to build roles for productive adult
participation that respect youth expertise, autonomy, and initiative”
(pp. 340-1).
Ample research supports the conclusion that brains change
depending on the information technology, and research also
suggests that humans adapt their behavior to the nature of the
information they encounter. Mark Deuze (2006), a media and
journalism researcher, concluded digital media demands that we
participate in the creation of media as we consume it, that we
remediate digital information as we become responsible for
navigating and assessing the vast information landscape, and that
we discover and invent new and unintended uses of information and
technologies through bricolage. In these ways, we live in a media
landscape that is much more participatory than the print-dominated
landscape of previous generations. We see, as well, that information
technology affects both the nature of human brains and the nature
of human behaviors.
In her 2017 book, iGen, psychologist Jean Twenge
attributed the extreme access to digital devices and social networks
to a number of trends observed in younger people who were born
after 1995. This generation appears to be delaying driving, romantic
relationships, and other adult activities compared to previous
generations; many report they never attended a party without adults
24

Efficacious Educational Technology

present by the time they graduated from high school. Twenge also
attributes greater levels of depression and other concerning mental
health trends in this generation to their use of digital devices. She
concludes, “The devices they hold in their hands have both extended
their childhoods and isolated them from true human interaction” (p.
312).

Effects on Organizations
Humans, we know, are social creatures; the organizations
and associations they form are an important part of life in the 21st
century. Students leave school to join organizations and businesses
after they graduate, and the success of schools is determined by the
degree to which graduates are able to function in those
organizations. In the same way that individuals in digital landscapes
are more active creators and consumers of information than
individuals in print landscapes, organizations are becoming more
flexible and dynamic in both the internal organizational structures
and management practices as well as the nature of interactions with
clients and customers.
Olumuyiwa Asaolu (2006), a scholar in industrial and
information engineering, applied the label “Fordist (Old)” to
organizations that are structured in a manner that reflects industrial
technologies. These organizations tend to consume energy to
produce standardized products using standardized methods, and
they tend to rely on individuals with specialized skills who are
managed through hierarchical systems. Asaolu concludes Fordist
(Old) organizations are being replaced with those he labels “ICT
(New)” which reflect modern information technology. These
organizations use information to create customized services through
flexible and innovative products. These organizations leverage
broad skills held by employees whose work is managed through
horizontal structures.
Among the factors contributing to the replacement of
Fordist (Old) organizations with ICT (New) organizations is the
rapid evolution of IT and the global communication that it supports
(Miller, 2011). This creates new problems and new opportunities for
organizations, and those that adopt ICT (New) characteristics appear
to be abler than Fordist (Old) to adapt to those opportunities that
require innovative solutions. The assets and social norms that
support innovation are self-creating and self-supporting and they
develop organically within ICT (NEW) organizations. Fordist (Old)
25

Efficacious Educational Technology

organizations tend to be highly controlled by the management, but
innovative thinking can be neither imposed nor mandated nor can it
be standardized, thus Fordist organizations at a disadvantage in
situation where flexibility, innovation, and other ICT (New)
approaches are necessary.
Manuel Castels, a sociologist who has held positions in both
North America and Europe has studied the wide-ranging effects of
computer networks on society, especially on economic
organizations. Commenting on the role of digital information and
computer networks in the rejuvenation of many businesses and
industries late in the 20th century, Castells (1996) noted,
“Technological innovation and organizational change, focusing on
flexibility and adaptability, were absolutely critical in ensuring the
speed and efficiency of restructuring” (p. 19). Castels goes on to
argue that human cognitive power to process abstract symbols,
which is much enhanced by the digital electronic computers, is the
basis for our capacity as a species to survive. Further, he posits that
while technology is largely shaped by social influences, “the
availability of new communication networks and information
systems prepared the ground for” (p. 53) new organizations and
social structures.

Effects on Society
The effects of information technology on human life
extends to society-wide characteristics as well. In preliterate
cultures, communication is communal and loud (at least audible).
For Plato to teach his students, they needed to be together and to
speak and listen. Writing and print allowed communication to be
solitary (writers and readers need not be together in time and space)
and silent (with practice, reading can be done inside one’s head and
writing is largely silent except for our writing tools and our attempts
to break writers’ block by talking to ourselves). The manner in
which social norms and values are remembered and interpreted in
preliterate cultures is dynamic (updated through communal
storytelling), and decisions in preliterate cultures are likely to
depend on the specific circumstances of a situation rather than on
reference to an abstract concept.
Once writing arrives in a society, ideas can be stored in a
more permanent manner than they can be in preliterate cultures;
abstract ideas enter the culture which allows for money, law and
evidence, sacred books and monotheist religions to emerge. Further,
26

Efficacious Educational Technology

those who have greater skill reading and writing tend to have greater
political and economic power than those with lesser skills, and
children are excluded from much of the information life in a literate
society until they become readers and writers. The marginalization
of individuals and groups based on lack of communications skill is
largely absent from preliterate societies.
In the 20th century, electronic media entered the popular
culture in the form of radio, movies, and television. These media
again changed the nature of information creation and consumption
in society where they were available. Compared to print media,
radio and television tended to be consumed in isolation but at the
same time (we watched alone, but everyone consumed the broadcast
at the same time); this pattern is changing as digital video becomes
more popular. While many legal documents are printed, electronic
media has come to dominate almost every aspect of economic,
political, and social life.
Perhaps the greatest change in information use in societies
with digital electronic media compared to earlier electronic media
is the degree to which individuals can participate in the global
media. With the arrival of the World Wide Web, then web 2.0
technologies that afford users the ability to easily publish content
(including multimedia content) to world-wide audiences, the nature
of users’ interaction with information became more participatory.
This access to publishing has contributed to the evolution of many
traditional institutions, including journalism. The British
Broadcasting Company (BBC), for example, has been active in both
encouraging responsible reporting by amateur journalists, and it has
developed formal processes for including information from amateur
journalists in its reports (Belair-Gagnon, 2016).
Palfrey and Gasser (2016) used the term semiotic
democracy to describe the effects of participatory content creation
on society. They observed, “any citizen with the skills, time, and
access to digital technologies to do so may reinterpret and reshape
the stories of the day” (p. 233). Of course, this can threaten social
and governmental institutions, and they observed that in times of
social and political instability, governments can and do take the step
of restricting or preventing citizens from accessing and participating
in the technologies that make the semiotic democracy possible.
Yochai Benkler (2016), a professor at Yale Law School, observed
access to computers and information technology extends throughout
society and he claimed, “the change brought about by the networked
27

Efficacious Educational Technology

information environment is deep. It is structural. It goes to the very
foundations of how liberal markets and liberal democracies have
coevolved for almost two centuries” (p. 1).
Schools for Networked Societies
School as we understand it is not a new invention; for
generations, adults have created and sustained them for a wide range
of purposes. High schools both provide access to sophisticated and
specialized curriculum and keep large numbers of able-bodied
individuals out of the work force. Organizational structures and
management practices are also articulated to meet a wide range of
purposes. Summer breaks allow children to return to agrarian work
when it is most needed (even in the 21st century when family farms
are largely disappeared from the landscape). In these ways, and
many others, we see how schools reflect the societies and cultures
that support them. In some instances, the structures and practices
remain after the need for them has disappeared. The slow rate of
change in schooling is yet another example of the conflict that
characterize the time when technologies replace technologies.
For convenience, we can mark the 21st century as the
historical moment digital information and information technologies
replaced print and ICT (New) organizations replaced Fordist (Old)
organizations. Certainly, this is an artificial and blurred boundary,
but for our purposes it is illustrative. We can reasonably expect this
boundary also marked by a transition in schools; presumably 21st
century schools replaced 20th century schools as different skills and
knowledge are needed to engage with new information technologies
and to participate and succeed in new organizations.
The change to education for ICT(New) organizations and
society is not complete. Indeed, as the third decade of the 21st
century approaches, there are two clearly different and competing
approaches to education we observe. One seeks to preserve and
continue education for print and Fordist (Old) organizations and the
other seeks to more clearly reflect ICT (New) organizations and to
educate for new literacies (Limbu, 2017). Just as writing replaced
orality over Plato’s protests, we can predict 21st century skills and
schools to replace 20th century schools, the nature of schools as the
transition continues and after it completes focus this section.

28

Efficacious Educational Technology

Nominal change in school
In the 21st century, several major political efforts have
sought to influence educational policy at a broad level; No Child
Left Behind (NCLB) (2002) and the Common Core State Standards
(CCSS) (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices,
Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010) are two that attained
national influence in the United States. Advocates for each indicated
the effort would revise curriculum, instruction, and assessment for
the 21st century. The publishers of tests used as part of CCSS claim
they are valid (McCall, 2016), but those claims appear unverified by
scholarly research. Further, claims by advocates that constructs and
measures used in these efforts are valid and reliable are also
unverified by scholarly research. Both NCLB and CCSS appear to
be grounded in three assumptions about teaching and learning that
dominated in the 20th century but that appear to be unsupported by
and even contradicted by the discoveries of learning sciences in
recent decades:
• The curriculum (what students should learn) is well-known
and accurately reflects the skills and knowledge students
need. The reality is that what represents knowledge changes
rapidly, and it is impossible to predict exactly which skills
or knowledge students is actually necessary for students.
• Educators know with certainty and clarity how to transfer
the curriculum into students’ minds. Cognitive science is
elucidating the details of how humans learn and the
environmental factors relevant to learning in ways
unavailable to earlier generations of teachers.
• Tests are an accurate and reliable measure of what students
have learned. Useful assessments and evaluations of
learning will be predictive; performance on those tasks will
indicate the student’s ability to use the information and
skills in other settings. Most tests lack this predictive ability.
Sawyer (2008) referred to education grounded in known
curriculum and tests as the Standard Model of teaching and
observed it had been widely adopted by the societies with
industrialized economies in the 20th century. Ronald Gallimore and
Roland Tharp (1992) educational psychologists who studied
29

Efficacious Educational Technology

conditions in classrooms that influence learning, referred to this type
of teaching as a recitation script and observed, “the predominant
experience of American school children. Sitting silently, students
read assigned texts, complete 'ditto' sheets, and take tests. On those
rare occasions when they are encouraged to speak, teachers control
the topics and participation” (p. 175)
The Standard Model has been increasingly challenged by
the observation that innovation economies were replacing industrial
economies and the Standard Model is recognized as no longer gave
students the opportunities to develop necessary skills. Helen Adabzi
(2016), a scholar from the University of Texas at Arlington,
observed, “many documents state that the traditional education has
failed, and it is time for a new paradigm [that] “teach[es] a
combination of basic, new and ‘soft’ skills [to] emphasize critical
thinking, communication, and leadership” (p. 256). The Standard
Model was also challenged by the observation that other models
were more closely aligned with discoveries regarding learning
emerging from the cognitive sciences. Deeper learning (Bransford,
Brown, and Cocking, 2000) has emerged as a model that recognizes
the social and emotional aspects of learning as well as the
importance of activity and engagement, including reflection, in
learning. Despite the finding that the Standard Model does not result
in students developing the skills and knowledge they need for postindustrial economies, Sawyer (2008) noted,
Many of today’s schools are not teaching the
deep knowledge that underlies innovative
activity. But it is not just a matter of asking
teachers to teach different curriculum, because
the structural configurations of the Standard
Model make it very hard to create learning
environments that result in deeper learning (pp.
48-9.)
It is reasonable to conclude the Standard Model of
education is based on assumptions about human learning that have
been overturned and it is less effective pedagogy for developing
necessary skills than others. Despite this, it seems the Standard
Model has been reinforced by the policy determined by NCLB and
CCSS.

30

Efficacious Educational Technology

For many observers (including the taxpayers who fund
public schools, the politicians who seek to control schools, the
parents who send their children to schools, and even many who
work in schools) what constitutes “school” is grounded in their
experience with the Standard Model. Their concepts are clear and
unquestioned and perceived to be objective and shared by all, so
proposals that would produce different experiences for students are
often shunned. This factor contributes to “institutional inertia,” and
schooling continuing as it has despite evidence it must change.
Also slowing the replacement of the Standard Model is the
fact that schools have become highly politicized institutions. In
2006, futurists Alvin Toffler and Heidi Toffler captured the relative
speed of change throughout society with this scale: businesses
appear to be adopting new information technologies and adapting to
them at 100 miles per hour, with other organizations (such as
professional organizations and non-governmental organizations)
moving almost as quickly; families in the United States are moving
at 60 miles per hour. Schools and other bureaucracies are moving at
a mere 25 miles per hour. Political parties and legislative processes
are moving even slower, at three miles per hour in the Tofflers’
estimate. If we accept this scale, then it is reasonable to assume that
schools would be adopting and adapting to new technologies faster
than they are if it were not for the slowing caused by political actions
(such as No Child Left Behind legislation and the Common Core
State Standards initiative) undertaken to “fix schools.”
The inconsistencies between the schools we need for
innovation economies and the instruction provided under the
Standard Model is yet another example of the conflict that Walter
Ong (1982) described when technologies are replaced and that have
become familiar in this chapter. Publicly funded and compulsory
education for all is widely perceived to be the foundation of
economic growth and effective governance in democracies. In the
United States, education has become a government service
influenced by increasingly centralized authorities as the population
grew and become more urbanized and mobile (McCluskey, 2007).
Especially since 1983 and the publication of A Nation at Risk (The
National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983), education
has become an issue in national elections at a level that was not
observed previously. This has placed education firmly among the
institutions that innovate at the slowest rate.

31

Efficacious Educational Technology

Alternatives to the Standard Model
Many educational scholars and practitioners have
recognized the inadequacy of the Standard Model in recent decades
and they have proposed alternative models of education. The
(incomplete) list of alternatives includes authentic learning
(Herrington, Reeves, & Oliver, 2015), natural learning (Caine &
Caine, 2011), project-based learning (Krajcik & Shin, 2014),
problem-based learning (Lu, Bridges, & Hmelo-Silver, 2014),
complex learning (Kirschner, Jeroen, & van Merrienboer, 2008),
learner-centered instruction (Stefaniak, 2015), situated learning
(Lave & Wenger, 1991), and cognitive apprenticeships (Dennen &
Burner, 2008). While advocates for these different methods vary in
the specifics of how they would implement schooling, there are
several assumptions about teaching, learning, and testing that they
share and that differentiate these approaches from the Standard
Model of schooling:
• The curriculum is assumed to be more dynamic and vastly
greater than can be articulated in standards and “covered”
by lectures and similar instruction, so these methods tend to
include an increased role for activities in which students
learn how to learn. It is reasoned that students who gain
experience learning with independence are better prepared
for rapidly changing and unpredictable knowledge and
situations that characterize New (ICT) organizations and
digital cultures.
• Because the curriculum will vary and because their
curriculum will, in part, be self-defined, teachers cannot
accurately predict students’ paths through the curriculum.
Further, new discoveries are likely to invalidate some of the
extant curriculum before it can be completed. For these
reasons, what students learn may vary.
• In these models, learning is understood to be a social activity
as much as it is a cognitive activity. Meaningful social
engagement between students and teachers and other
experts and among students are purposefully designed into
the learning activities.

32

Efficacious Educational Technology

• How learning is demonstrated varies. In these models,
learning is best demonstrated through performance on
authentic projects and performances, while schools based in
the Standard Model tend to rely on test scores as the primary
measure of learning.
• Finally, metacognition—knowing how and what one
knows—is a goal of learning in the alternatives to the
Standard Model.
The boundaries between schooling when the Standard
Model dominated and 21st century schools are not as clear as I have
presented. Activities, lessons, courses, and curriculum frameworks
that promote 21st century skills have been available for decades
(Dede, 2010). Student-based learning, constructivist methods, and
other alternatives to the Standard Model of teaching have been
described and promoted by scholars and practitioners, but those
methods have largely been marginalized and have not been the focus
of the wide-scale efforts to define educational policy. It is
anticipated that 21st century pedagogies will replace the Standard
Model, and the Standard Model will become the marginalized
pedagogy.
Daniel Pink (2006) can be credited with popularizing the
term “necessary, but not sufficient” to describe the linear skills that
are well-developed through the Standard Model. Scholars have
continued to elucidate many trends, especially economic trends, that
necessitate the curriculum be revised to both provide linear skills,
but also prepare students to be flexible and innovative. The nature
of the workers needed in institutions that reflect the ICT (New)
organization, illustrate these changes. Johannessen (2008)
concluded,
the workforce will shift away from employees
who have traditional, practical training
backgrounds and towards an ever-increasing
number of employees who have had a higher
education and are theoretically well equipped.
Such workers will be capable of working in a
problem definition and problem-oriented
manner and possess skills for both analysis and
synthesis (p. 407).
33

Efficacious Educational Technology

Richard Suskind and Daniel Suskind (2015), scholars and
policy analysts from the United Kingdom, observed workers “will
need to learn to communicate differently, to gain mastery of the data
in their disciplines, to establish working relationships with their
machines, and to diversify” (p. 114). The factors contributing to the
changing nature of educational outcomes include globalism and
technology-driven automation, as well as the availability of
increasingly sophisticated information technology. Levy and
Murname (2004) cited evidence that there are four trends that are
changing that nature the tasks that will be necessary for workers:
(see figure 1.1):
• Complex communication, which requires one to interpret
sophisticated information and articulate clear explanations,
is becoming one of the most important skills for workers.
• Expert thinking, which requires one create solutions to
unique and unfamiliar problems, is becoming increasingly
important (but less than complex communication).

Figure 1.1. Expected trends in 21st century work (Adapted from Levy and
Murname, 2004)

• Routine manual labor is decreasing in importance as
robots and other tools automate the easy-to-repeat physical
tasks common in the industrial economy.
• Routine cognitive work is decreasing even more in
importance as algorithms perform simple analyses and
34

restatement of information, and draw conclusions based on
quantitative data.
While most see clear connections between the skills Levy
and Murname identify and the curriculum common in the Standard
Model, there is also increasing need to diversify the skills that
students develop during their school careers; these emerging skills
are motivated by factors other than economic as well. In his 2010
book Wisdom, Stephen Hall who is an award-winning writer about
science and society, posed the question, “How do we make complex,
complicated decisions and life choices, and what makes some of
these choices so clearly wise that we all intuitively recognize them
as a moment, however brief, of human wisdom?” (p. 6). Hall
recounted the story of a scholar who has become a leader in the field
of wisdom studies, and who concluded,
that wisdom represented a state of mind beyond
standard metrics of intelligence, and this
revelation forced him to see inherent failures in
the educational system, and the philosophy of
educational testing, and the degree to which too
narrow measures like IQ tests fail miserably to
predict lifetime satisfaction (p. 245).
Hall concluded wisdom is grounded in eight characteristics
which are generally ignored in the Standard Model, but that are
more important than traditional measures of knowledge when
solving complex problems: emotional regulation, knowing what’s
important, moral reasoning, compassion, humility, altruism,
patience, dealing with uncertainty.
While advocates for the Common Core State Standards and
other standards argue that curriculum is known and measurable via
a test, the scholars whose work is summarized in this section do not
appear to agree. They appear to concur, rather, with Douglas
Thomas and John Seely Brown who concluded full participation in
the digital society necessitates individuals have the capacity for
lifelong learning as workers and citizens will be adapting to new
technologies and new information in perpetuity. They propose
schooling be focused by, “a new culture of learning the point [of
which] is to embrace what we don’t know, come up with better

35

Efficacious Educational Technology

questions about it, and continue asking those questions in order to
learn more about it” (Thomas and Brown, 2011, p. 38).
Clearly, schools must adopt curriculum and instruction to
reflect the needs of citizens in the digital society, and there have
been localized efforts to make these changes. The rate at which
schools are changing appears to be far behind the speed at which
other organizations are changing, but schools are adapting faster
than the political organizations that govern schools. The design of
the learning environments necessitated by a world in which
traditional skills and knowledge are still important, but that are no
longer sufficient has important implications for IT managers as both
of these models of teaching are dependent on IT that is appropriately
and properly configured.

Implications for IT Management
It was concluded in the previous section that the Standard
Model is being replaced, however, it is anticipated that both the
Standard Model and its alternatives will organize teaching and
learning into the future. It follows that IT managers will be
responsible to ensure that the systems they create and sustain have
the capacity and functionality to support both types of teaching and
learning.
The Standard Model of education is dominated by
instructionism in which an expert (the teacher) defines the content
to be studied, the manner and order in which it is going to be
experienced, and finally determines the extent to which each student
has learned it. While some associate instructionism with the leaners
being passive recipients of information, Burton, Moore, and
Magliaro (2004) suggested instruction can provide a structure for
approaching a complex body of knowledge and also for maintaining
knowledge. Reif (2008) identified several factors that make
instruction effective including articulating very clear goals; the
inclusion of explicit and implicit guidance, support, and feedback
that can be individualized; and providing timely and appropriate
feedback.
Instruction is amenable to deconstruction into several
components: goals, a predictable path through known content, and
clear determination of outcomes, along with appropriate feedback.
These are all clearly definable and knowable before the instruction
begins, thus instruction amenable to technology-based delivery.
36

Efficacious Educational Technology

Reif (2008) concluded, “Computers are well suited for instructional
purposes because they provide a dynamic medium that can not only
convey information in visual and auditory forms, but can also
flexibly interact with users so as to respond to their actions” (p. 428).
Instructionism has been used to create a variety of digital
educational materials. This list includes arcade-style games
designed to teach mathematics skills, spelling words, typing skills,
and similar lessons; intelligent tutoring systems for individualized
lessons (e.g. test preparation systems); and simulations, which are
designed to make the instructional activity more context-rich than
arcade-style games typically are. Bowers (1988) criticized these
designs as “students encounter a one-dimensional world of objective
data” (p. 34), and he concluded the prejudices and biases of the
programmers exert strong and perhaps unintentional effects on the
lessons learned. When they are aware of these limitations and take
steps to minimize their influence on the materials, instructional
designers can create very effective instructional materials (for
appropriate purposes) by the judicious application of technologies.
Efficacious IT managers will build systems that can be used
to deliver instruction by ensuring:
• Students can access appropriate instructional materials
including both locally installed programs and web-based
media;
• Teachers have resources for creating instructional materials;
• Instructional materials are accessible to those students who
have disabilities;
• Teachers have access to easy-to-use systems for managing
instructional resources they create and that they find. This
can include both local copies of files and online
repositories.
One of the reports that emerged from the comprehensive John D.
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation’s Digital Media project
was The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age (Davidson
& Goldberg, 2009). In that book, 10 characteristics of learning in
the digital age are proposed (see table 1.1). The authors observed,
“Digital technologies increasingly enable and encourage social
37

Efficacious Educational Technology

networking and interactive, collaborative engagements, including
those implicating and impacting learning” (Davidson & Goldberg,
2009, p. 24). They further confirm a commitment to developing
alternatives to the Standard Model of education noting learners will
become more participatory in virtual environments “where they
share ideas, comment on one another’s projects, and plan, design,
implement, advance, or simply discuss their practices, goals or ideas
together” (p. 12). As the pillars are more completely implemented
in a community, the implications for teaching and learning as well
as professional learning become more pressing.

38

Efficacious Educational Technology

In the milieu of researchers’ and practitioners’ perceptions
of the trends emerging in digital education, there is evidence to
support Gros’ (2016) observation, “The ubiquity of technology calls
for a shift away from low-level use of technology, such as drilling,
practice and looking up information. Rather, smart education
encourages ‘high-level’ uses of technology, utilising it as a ‘mind
tool’ or ‘intellectual partner’ for creativity, collaboration, and
multimedia productivity” (p. 6). Such systems are built for
interoperability and seamless connection of devices (to facilitate use
of multiple devices), allow for adaptable configuration for users’
preferences, and engage teachers and learners in natural engagement
(Zhu, Hu, & Riezebos , 2016).
To address the pillars of digital learning, efficacious IT
managers in schools will revise how the range of IT infrastructure,
practices, and policies are instantiated. The tools must accommodate
interaction and creation of information as much as it accommodates
access to and consumption of information. The teaching and
learning that students experience will likewise be flexible and
interactive in a manner it was not when the Standard Model
dominated. The design of these learning environments necessitates
insightful and attentive school leaders as well.

Conclusion
Given the conflict that accompanies the arrival of new
information technologies, it is reasonable to expect scholars and
practitioners to have struggled to define the appropriate role for the
devices in teaching and learning in today’s schools. Some have
adopted a stance similar to that Plato adopted towards writing; they
have avoided it entirely. Others are quick to adopt every new
innovation. Between those extremes we find the more reasoned
observers and practitioners who advocate for purposeful and
thoughtful approaches to using information technology in
classrooms. Todd Oppenheimer (2003) who generally argues for
avoiding technology in his book The Flickering Mind observed
computers “can be effective when they are used only as needed,
when students are at the right age or them, and when they are kept
in their place” (p. 394). David Jonassen, a scholar who studied
educational technology for decades and was recognized as a leader
in the field, differentiated active learning in which technology is
39

Efficacious Educational Technology

used to “engage learners, in representing, manipulating, and
reflecting on what they know,” from passive learning in which
students used technology for “reproducing what someone tells
them” (2000, p. 10).
We know schools are designed for the purpose of enabling
and encouraging young people to fully engage with information
technology so they can participate in the economic, political, and
cultural life of society. The curriculum comprises those skills and
that knowledge that is necessary for this goal. It is expected the
complexity of society’s IT will be reflected in the strategic goals
articulated by school leaders and the curriculum and instruction
designed to achieve those goals. For the digital generations, the
process of revising curriculum and instruction is further complicated
by the changing nature of information technology in the society.
Plato, we saw previously, argued against the incorporation of
reading and writing into schools.
One’s perception of changing information technology
depends on the direction from which one perceives the change.
Older generations grew up using the information technology that is
being replaced tend to perceive the arrival of IT and the transition in
schooling associated with the IT in a negative manner. For them,
using new information technology is degrading human cognition
and students are not being taught the skills and knowledge that they
value and that were necessary for their generation. Younger
generations perceive the emerging information technology as
natural to their future, and they tend to adopt the technologies and
become comfortable with emerging information and technologies.
The challenge for efficacious IT managers is to negotiate the many
factors that affect the transition.

40

CHAPTER 2: TECHNOLOGY-RICH TEACHING & LEARNING

The transition from the Standard Model of education to the
alternatives that are emerging to replace it is an incomplete
and unpredictable activity. IT managers (along with the
teachers they support) who have a framework for
understanding the role of technology in the many activities
that comprise teaching and learning will design more effective
systems than those who do not. In this chapter, technology-rich
teaching and learning is deconstructed so it can be understood
by IT managers.

Because new information technologies (including
hardware, software, and information sources, along with new uses
of each) emerge very quickly compared to the periodicity of schools
(new technologies appear several times during a typical school
year), teachers must adopt and adapt to them constantly. When
deciding which technologies to use, teachers are more likely to use
technologies that:
• Are easier to use than existing technologies;
• Are more effective than existing technologies;
• Complement existing technologies.
While it may appear easy to select technology that meets
these characteristics, those decisions are complicated by the
diversity of the devices that emerge as well as the effects the
technologies have on students and teachers and culture. In this

Efficacious Educational Technology

chapter, a framework with which educators can understand the role
of new technologies in their work is described. In addition,
strategies for supporting educators’ understanding of technologies
in their classrooms are described.

Logistic Goal
A comprehensive IT management plan will articulate a
logistic goal related to supporting teachers as they become
competent users of IT and teachers with IT. In addition to capturing
a central role for information technology in the curriculum, this
logistic goal will include all students and will include diverse
technology experiences. For example, “Every student will gain
experience using technology to access, consume, and create
information and to interact with others in all classes.”

Context for the Logistic Goal
The need to articulate a logistic goal supporting technologyrich teaching and learning for all students, and in all areas, arises
from the non-neutrality of IT. The information technology common
in a society determines what it means to be “literate” in the society,
so all teachers have the responsibility to expose students to
technology-rich information and interaction in their field. Teachers
who ignore IT today are no different from teachers who ignored text
in previous generations. We know from the arguments in Chapter 1
that information technology affects individual humans, the
organizations humans create, and the culture in which humans live.
These effects extend into classrooms as well. To accomplish the
logistic goal of using technology in classroms, school IT managers
support a) on-going training to use IT, b) learning about emerging
information technologies, and c) design opportunities to ensure ITrich teaching and learning is embedded in all curriculum areas.
Soon after desktop computers arrived in schools, the Apple
Classrooms of Tomorrow project studied the interactions of students
and teachers in classrooms. One of the findings from that work, and
a finding that has been demonstrated ever since, is that putting new
information technology in classrooms does not mean it will be used
for effective teaching and learning (Sandholtz, Ringstaff, & Dwyer,
1997; Schofield, 1995). In the decades since computers arrived,
there has been on-going study of the factors that influence teachers’
use of technology. It is clear from this research that teachers’ beliefs
42

Efficacious Educational Technology

about technology and teaching, the nature of the technology and its
support, other’s use of technology, and the availability of curriculum
and materials that make of use technology are all important factors
affecting the decision to use computers in a classroom (for example
(Buabeng-Andoh, 2012; Kim & Reeves, 2007; Mumtaz, 2000;
Somekh, 2008; Zhao & Frank, 2003). Even as researchers
understood the factors associated with technology use by teachers
and the affordance of IT associated with alternative methods, the
Standard Model of instruction dominated and technology continued
to be a marginal part of students’ experience.
For the most recent generation of teachers, the difficulties
of finding a role for technology in the classroom and then fully
implementing it has been complicated by three factors. First, the rate
at which computers and information technology change has been
rapid and accelerating. New technologies emerge and gain widespread acceptance in very short time spans compared to
technologies throughout the 20th century. For educators, whose
technology-rich teaching tends to be cyclic with a one-year period,
the obsolescence of technologies that happens on a time scale of
months can be disconcerting and disruptive.
Second, the current generation of educators are working at
a time when cognitive and learning sciences are challenging much
of what they experienced as “good” education when they were
students or what they were taught in their teacher education
programs. We are understanding the complexities of human brains
and the important role that emotions and social interaction play in
human learning, so educators can no longer simply be dispensers of
information. Creating effective learning environments is more
complicated than it was previously regardless of the role of
technology.
Third, education has become politicized at a scale that it was
not in earlier generations. In the United States, education law and
policy is created at all levels of government, and these laws can
sometimes be contrary to other laws and they often are contrary to
what cognitive and learning science tells us is natural for humans.
In educational technology, the United States government has written
technology plans in which educational and political leaders
articulated new and more sophisticated expectations for teachers
and school IT managers:
• Getting America’s Students Ready for the 21st Century:
Meeting the Technology Challenge (1996)—The first
43

Efficacious Educational Technology

technology plan focused on ensuring teachers had
computers and software and were trained in how to use
them; this plan largely addressed the need to obtain
computing devices and ensure teachers could operate them.
• e-Learning: Putting a World-Class Education at the
Fingertips of All Children. The National Educational
Technology Plan. (2000)—This plan continued the focus on
hardware, software, and also extended infrastructure to
include networks and extended the focus teachers’ learning
to the transformation of instructional activities to make use
of technology.
• Toward A New Golden Age in American Education—How
the Internet, the Law and Today’s Students Are
Revolutionizing Expectations (2004)—This plan changed
the focus from technology planning to different types of
technology-rich learning, namely online learning.
• Transforming American Education: Learning Powered by
Technology. (2010)—This technology plan again refocused
technology planning on assessment and measuring student
outcomes.
• Future Ready Learning: Reimagining the Role of
Technology in Education. National Education Technology
Plan (2016)—This plan is comprehensive and includes
goals related to infrastructure, teaching and learning,
professional development, innovation and assessment.
• Reimagining the Role of Technology in Education (2017)—
In this plan that Department of Education of the United
States intends to begin more frequent and less
comprehensive updates.
In the decades-long history of advice for IT managers from
the national education leaders, we can see changes in what they were
expected to do locally. While it is reasonable for all organizational
leaders, especially leaders of public institutions, to adjust their goals
and their planning efforts to reflect new knowledge and developing
practice, the changes in direction coming from external and
politically powerful influences can produce unintended
44

Efficacious Educational Technology

consequences for local communities. What was “best practice”
while one plan was in place is abandoned when a new plan is
released. Planners are rarely able to follow through with steps to
address one set of goals before the next necessitates they turn their
attention to other goals. The result is that educational technology
planners have rarely been able to complete their plans and fully
understand the implications of their work before the focus changed.
Educators are also a non-neutral part of schools; their
beliefs, values, and experiences all affect the actions they take. For
those who have become deeply engaged with a set of practices and
who have invested much cognitive effort in understanding the
rationale behind those practices, the decision to abandon them can
be distressing. This problem is exacerbated when the decisionmakers show little empathy for the knowledge of the teachers and
the affective connection they have for their work.
To accommodate these many changing factors influencing
IT managers and the environments for which they design systems
and to introduce some consistency into the planning for technologyrich teaching and learning, IT managers can use theory to organize
their efforts. When work is organized by sound theory, changes in
the focus of technology planning can appear less drastic to members
of the organization than when new goals cause new priorities. This
is particularly effective when they seek to define improvement in
ways that can be affected by known factors and that can be observed
with known methods.

Deconstructing Technology-Rich Teaching
Teacher education has traditionally been informed by a
framework comprising the content dimension (what is to be taught
or the curriculum) and the pedagogy dimension (how it is taught or
instruction). Shulman (1987) suggested teachers’ content
knowledge and pedagogical knowledge cannot be developed in
isolation, so he proposed “pedagogical content knowledge” (PCK)
to describe the capacity of a teacher to organize, explain, and
communicate ideas so that students understand the content. The
adage commonly applied to education, “you never really understand
it until you teach it,” captures the interconnected nature of content
and pedagogy; educators better understand content through teaching
it and they better understand pedagogy by applying it to teaching
problems in their classrooms.
45

Efficacious Educational Technology

In extending Shulman’s concept of PCK, Mishra and
Koehler (2006) observed technology had emerged as a distinct type
of knowledge. In adding technological knowledge (TK) to
Shulman’s model, Mishra and Koehler recognized computer
technology is qualitatively different from pencils and paper and the
other long-established print technologies, so it enters the model as a
separate type of knowledge. It is reasoned that as digital information
technology becomes more familiar, its existence as a separate type
of knowledge will decrease. Technological pedagogical content
knowledge (TPCK) (see figure 2.1) has become a very useful
framework for understanding teaching and learning in the
technology-rich school. While TPCK does comprise distinct and
isolatable types of knowledge, it is presented as a model that
“emphasizes the connections, interactions, affordances, and
constraints between and among content, pedagogy, and
technology,” and “emphasizes the interplay of these three bodies of
knowledge.” (Mishra & Kohler, 2006, p. 125).

Figure 2.1. TPCK model (adapted from Mishra & Koehler, 2006)

46

Efficacious Educational Technology

As a framework useful to inform IT management decisions
in school, TPCK identifies seven types of knowledge that can be
improved with educators’ increased awareness of new technologies
and with their increased knowledge of teaching methods that make
use of technology. The state of TPCK within a school community
can evaluated from an individual’s perspective and also from the
perspective of the entire faculty. Social influences are known to be
an important determinate in technology acceptance (Venktah & et
al. 2003), so each individual’s TPCK is affected by the group’s
TPCK, and the TPCK of influential individuals are particularly
important in affecting the group’s TPCK.
TPCK is proposed as a dynamic framework and Mishra and
Kohler (2006) anticipated it would change over time. Shulman
(1987) did not differentiate books, pencils, paper, and other
information technologies into a separate type of knowledge when
PCK was first elucidated; he reasoned those were transparent
technologies and a stable part of teaching and learning for
generations, thus no specific knowledge was necessary to use
technology. Given the continued rapid development and diffusion
of information and computer technology hardware, software, and
network platforms, technological knowledge is anticipated to be an
important part of TPCK into the foreseeable future. Further, the
nature of the classroom determines how TPCK is defined and
instantiated. Mishra and Koehler (2006) observed, “there is no
single technological solution that applies to every teacher, every
course, or every view of teaching” (p. 1029).
Using TPCK, IT managers can identify and support all
aspects of technology in teaching and learning. The model also
allows IT managers to identify and clarify the connections between
the various types of knowledge. In addition, TPCK facilitates
understanding of who must be involved with decisions and who
must lead and participate in training, curriculum development, and
other professional development activities.

Technological Knowledge
When desktop computers first arrived in schools, leaders
found it necessary to provide training and support in the basic
operation of the devices. At that time, teachers were unlikely to have
access to computers at home and it was unlikely they had been
exposed to them during their professional preparation. (In the mid1980’s, I was in the minority of my peers enrolled in the teacher
47

Efficacious Educational Technology

education program at out state university who enrolled in the
optional “Computers in the Classroom” course offered to
undergraduate students; most of my colleagues earned their teaching
credentials without any formal experiences with computers.)
Simply turning computers on and loading software was the focus of
the first computer training for teachers. Software tools such as word
processors and spreadsheets were also new, so training sessions
introduced educators to the steps of creating, editing, and managing
files as well. This reality is also reflected in the goal articulated in
the first National Education Technology Plan for the United States
which was written in 1996. At the time, educational policy makers
sought to address the Technology Literacy Challenge which
President Clinton had defined as connecting every classroom to the
Internet and ensuring teachers could use it.
In the decades since computers arrived, they have become
common household tools and their use is deeply embedded in the
higher education courses that are needed to be qualified for almost
any position in education. In those same decades, very complex
software and network services have been adopted by schools to
manage information and provide interaction for educational and
business purposes. The result is that educators’ technological
knowledge includes that which they must develop and maintain on
their own and that which must be developed by IT managers. Part
of the screening process for candidates for licensed educators and
unlicensed assistants who work directly with students must ensure
each who fills one of those positions is capable of operating a
computer and common software for professional purposes.
Educational professionals arrive at their positions with these skills
and maintain them with minimal training throughout their careers.
Powering a computer on, logging on to networks, and creating and
managing files using locally installed software and cloud-based
productivity suites are all tasks educators must be able to
accomplish with efficiency, confidence, and independence. In
addition, they should be capable of searching and finding credible
information on the Internet; this includes multimedia information as
well as electronic versions of printed materials. Further, educators
should model responsible and ethical use of technology systems and
digital media. Finally, educators should be able to adapt to new
versions of software and similar upgrades quickly and with little
direct instruction.
There are some tools educators should not be expected to
use without direct instruction and IT managers must plan for these
48

Efficacious Educational Technology

needs when newly hired educators are “on-boarded” and to support
educators during major transitions. The IT systems that require
direct instruction include:
• Procedures and credentials for logging on to all systems that
are needed by the professional, including local area
network, email, and all web services used to manage
employment, data, and instruction;
• Instructions for managing rosters and grades through the
student information system; these systems are notorious for
being “not user friendly,” which can be attributed to the
differences between the vocabulary and structures used by
designers and programmers and the language and methods
used by educators;
• Instructions for posting to the educators’ page(s) on the
school web site, the learning management system, social
media sites, and other systems for sharing information with
both internal and external audiences they are expected to
use.
Implicit in this as well is the expectation that educators will
be introduced to local policies and procedures relative to acceptable
use, procedures to report malfunctioning IT systems, scheduling
shared resources, accessing printers, and similar details related to
individuals’ use of the specific IT systems installed in the school.
On-boarding procedures for new staff must address these aspects of
using IT, and changes in how these systems are configured
necessitates training for all faculty and staff to ensure efficient and
effective use of the new tools.

Content Knowledge
Content knowledge may appear to be the most clearly
understood and defined type of knowledge. We all expect, for
example, chemistry teachers to understand the concepts, idea, and
procedures of chemistry; and this content is found in chemistry
textbooks. By successfully completing advanced undergraduate
courses in a content area, teacher candidates demonstrate sufficient
content knowledge so they understand what they are supposed to

49

Efficacious Educational Technology

teach, including relevant details such as how to recognize when
chemistry is being done in an unsafe manner.
The content that future teachers study in their undergraduate
courses is developed by those with advanced degrees in the field.
Their expertise is assured by the universities granting their degrees,
their research, participation in professional organizations, and
service to the universities where they are employed. The reality of
content knowledge for many educators is becoming more
complicated in the digital world, however. Two factors appear to be
exerting particularly strong effects on content knowledge as it is
experienced in schools.
First, digital technology makes sophisticated information
far more accessible than it was in the print-dominated world. For
many generations, access to information written by and for
professional chemists (for example) depended on access to a
research library where the copies of the journals were stored and the
professionals who taught at that university could help individuals
access and understand that information. Since computer networks
have become widely available, access to professional literature
(which is now digital) has expanded to every location with an
Internet connection and a subscription to a database of periodicals
is located.
Second, digital information tools are used by individuals,
including those with dubious credibility, to distribute information
widely. Further, information has become politicized to a greater
degree than it was for previous generations, and marginalized and
fringe ideas and interpretations of evidence are becoming widely
reported and defended.
Together, these factors both afford new opportunities for
students and teachers and cause difficulties for those people. Both
the affordances and difficulties have implication for efficacious IT
managers. These are also the foundation for the pillars of digital
learning (Davidson & Goldberg, 2009) (see Table 1.1).
In 1644, John Milton composed a pamphlet in which he
argues for freedom of expression; areopagitica has been adopted as
a term to describe the capacity for individual to compose and
distribute any ideas they see fit. Digital tools, especially those called
Web 2.0 tools have been interpreted as the realization of
areopagetica and students can use these tools to extend and expand
the audience of their works. They no longer create solely for their
teachers, but they can create for global audiences. This changes the
nature of writing and creating for students.
50

Efficacious Educational Technology

Areopagetica has been adopted by other creators as well, so
the vast content available to educators and students includes
accurate information from credible sources, fiction packaged as fact,
as well as myths, misinterpretations, sarcasm presented as fact.
These many variations fill the space between accurate and credible
information and purse falsehood. This disparate information led
Mark Dueze (2006), a scholar of media and journalism, to conclude
the digital media landscape is filled with content creators who
“juxtapose, challenge, or even subvert the mainstream” (p. 68) for a
variety of reasons.
In a 2016 report on science communication, the National
Academies noted a study in which 40% of Americans reported they
get science news from Facebook. This contributed to the Committee
on the Science of Science and Science Communication (2016) to
observe,
there are more actors in the media landscape who
may, either intentionally or unintentionally,
provide inaccurate science information. While
today’s science media landscape is likely larger
than the declining mass media/newspaperdelivery system of the past, it does not offer clear
mechanisms for filtering out false, sensational,
and misleading information. More than ever
before, citizens are left to their own devices as
they struggle to determine whom to trust and
what to believe about science-related
controversies (p. 4-2).
In the months after the 2016 elections in the United States,
the term “fake news” gained in popularity to describe the
phenomenon of unverified information in the media. For K-12
educators, navigating and helping students to navigate this emerging
information landscape determines the reality of content knowledge.
An increasing number of organizations are influencing the
contents of recommended curriculum and resources, and this is
further complicating content knowledge (CK) for educators. In
recent decades, educators’ professional organizations have begun
publishing curriculum standards (for example National Council of
Teachers of English & International Reading Association, 1996;
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000; NGSS Lead
States, 2013). In the 2010, the National Governors Association,
51

Efficacious Educational Technology

initiated the Common Core State Standards, which is an effort to
create a national curriculum in the United States. Ostensibly these
organizations seek to improve education, but the political nature of
governorships makes this a dubious claim; further, educators
professional organizations may be motivated to maintain and
expand membership rather than affect education.
Textbook publishers also exert strong influences on what is
taught. In some jurisdictions, a small number of textbooks are
adopted for use by large number of students, publishers approach
these areas as mass markets and adopt the strategy of providing the
least objectionable content (Johnson, 2006) which allows publishers
to sell to the widest audiences with the least potential for offending
or alienating large subpopulations so that their media is avoided.
The open educational resource (OER) movement is another
factor that is affecting content knowledge in the 21st century school.
OER’s are alternatives to textbooks that are published under
copyright licenses that allow others to copy, edit, and redistribute
the materials without the need to pay the original author or to seek
further permission. Typically, an open education resource originates
when an expert (often one who teaches undergraduate courses in a
field), polishes and details the resources prepared for his or her
students, and uploads them to the Internet under the Creative
Commons license. An educator who finds the resources and wants
to adopt them will download the file, edit it to meet his or her
students’ needs, and the focus of the course being taught. The
materials derived from an OER source are then made available to
the students, and to complete the transaction, the derivative resource
is contributed back to the open education community.
Educators and efficacious IT managers are left with the task
of providing appropriate access to the vast information sources that
are available so they can maintain and update their content
knowledge. They provide access to full-text databases for library
patrons, they help teachers learn about and design learning activities
that give students experience navigating the vast information
landscape, and they support educators who participate in OER
communities all the while seeking to minimize access to information
of dubious credibility.

Pedagogical Knowledge
Of the three individual types of knowledge that contribute
to TPCK, pedagogical knowledge is perhaps the most complicated
52

Efficacious Educational Technology

as it is the one with the broadest definition. Relevant technological
knowledge is largely defined by the systems available in the school;
content knowledge is largely defined by experts who teach the
teachers and by textbook and OER publishers. Technological
knowledge and content knowledge are clearly bounded and
consensus can generally be reached about what constitutes the
domain and how it can be improved. Pedagogical knowledge, on the
other hand, is defined differently by different scholars and vastly
different actions can be called pedagogy. Further, the appropriate
pedagogy depends on the goals of the activity as well as the nature
of the students and the nature of the curriculum. Pedagogical
knowledge is a less clearly understood than other types of
knowledge and consensus regarding improvement cannot be easily
reached.
How pedagogical knowledge is instantiated in the
classroom is largely dependent on decisions made by the teacher.
Much of the professional discourse on pedagogy, including research
and both pre-service and in-service teacher education, differentiates
two types of pedagogy. The Standard Model captures one approach
to teaching that continues to be supported by various stakeholders.
Chris Dede (2010), a scholar from Harvard University, reviewed the
many curriculum frameworks that had been produced in the 21st
century, and he concluded they demonstrated that educators and
education leaders were “systematically examin[ing] all the tacit
beliefs and assumptions about schooling that are legacies from the
20th century and the industrial age” (p. 73).
In recent decades, a number of pedagogical models have
been presented that call for students to play a more active role in
defining curriculum building knowledge, and communicating what
they have learned than it typically allowed in instructional
pedagogies. While advocates for these many methods differ in the
specific details of classroom activity, these methods share the
common elements of a curriculum based in complex problems,
ample opportunities for social interaction (between teachers and
students and among students), students are found articulating their
new knowledge, and attending to metacognitive understanding.
Advocates for these methods ground their pedagogy in cognitive
psychology (rather than behaviorist psychology) and build their
rationale around theorists such as Jean Piaget, John Dewey, and Lev
Vygotsky.
Instructionism, which is largely used in the Standard Model,
is teacher-centered pedagogy, and it has been established that it can
53

Efficacious Educational Technology

be applied with efficacy to the small portion of content that consists
of well-known concepts and ideas as well as procedures that can be
clearly described. When teachers use instruction, they plan the
logical path through the content and they decide when students
(either individually or collectively move along). Teachers also
measure success by students’ retention of the information and
procedures. These methods are grounded in the assumption that
learners respond to rewards and punishments; it is reasoned that by
rewarding answers and actions that are aligned with expectations (or
by punishing those that are not), teachers can promote learning.
Pedagogical knowledge extends beyond understanding the
nature of teaching strategies and skill at using those strategies to
plan and execute lessons. Educators can approach their work from
different perspectives and this affects both what they plan for
students and how they present lessons. Douglas Thomas and John
Seely Brown differentiate education that teaches about content from
education that teaches within the content. When students learn about
a subject, they are external to the content and teaching focuses on
transferring declarative knowledge and procedures to the learners.
Thomas and Brown (2011) suggested this can be mechanistic with
“learning treated as a series of steps to be mastered….” (p. 25).
When students learn from within the subject, they adopt the methods
and approaches of those who work to investigate problems in the
field and they produce products similar to those created by workers
in the field. This leads to learners developing both explicit
knowledge and tacit knowledge, and Thomas and Brown (2011)
observed, “the point is to embrace what we don’t know, and
continue asking those questions in order to learn more and more….”
(p. 38).
Research focusing on learning in informal situations
(Lemke, Lecusay, Cole, & Michalchik, 2015) is extending
pedagogical knowledge to recognize the role of the learners in the
process. Rogoff (1990) described guided participation as a method
of informal learning that started with highly-scaffolded modeling
and demonstration by mentors early in the experience, but learners
assume increasing responsibility for planning, undertaking, and
judging the learning products as they develop greater expertise.
Caine and Caine (2011) proposed guided experience as a pedagogy
that captures the nature of learning that occurs in natural
environments, which follows the perception/ action cycle. The
perception/ action cycle posits learning is the continuous process of
recognizing a situation, interpreting it according to what it is already
54

Efficacious Educational Technology

known, acting, and then adjusting further perceptions according to
feedback after acting. Guided experiences are based on three
elements:
• Relaxed alertness which find the learners motivated and
prepared to learn in a stress-free, but high-expectation,
environment.
• A complex experience which finds the learners acting in the
same manner as experts rather than learning about what
experts know.
• Active processing experience which finds the learners
thinking about and making sense of their experiences.
Digital media is also presented as more amenable to guided
experience than print. Caine and Caine (2011) even suggest that
“technology often plays havoc” with pedagogy designed to transmit
knowledge as it “includes student decision making, applying
creative solutions to complex and real-life problems, and
negotiating with peers and experts” (p. 20). Because more channels
of communication, including body language and other movements,
are possible with video but nit with text, the nature of the learning
that can occur is different when using video media.
Mizuko Ito and her colleagues at the Digital Media and
Learning Research Hub seem to have expanded the definition of
natural learning as they studied connected learning in young people
who comprise the digital generations. That research group observed
learning that occurs outside of school tends to be “socially
embedded, interest-driven, and organized toward educational,
economic, or political opportunity” (Ito, et. al, 2013, p. 6). The
students who arrive in today’s classrooms are active and
independent learners because of their experiences in the digital
world, thus their experiences influence which pedagogies are
effective with these populations. Such differences have been
recognized by educational scholars for decades, and they led
Bereiter (2002) to conclude, “everyday cognition makes more sense
if we abandon the idea of a mind operating on stored mental content
and replace it with the idea of a mind continually and automatically
responding to the world” (pp. 196-7).
As students become more active in creating and
communicating new knowledge, basic skills and knowledge can
55

Efficacious Educational Technology

become relevant, so students become motivated to learn the content
that is teachable through instruction. As they adopt student-centered
methods, many educators are finding a renewed need to include
instruction-based methods in their classrooms. This need is less
predictable than in instruction and tends to hold the attention of
individuals or small groups of students; computer technology and
digital media are meeting those needs. Consider the science student
who is investigating trajectories of projectiles; she will find it
necessary to work with quadratic equations. Using technology, the
teacher can direct the student to a lesson reviewing the methods of
solving quadratic equations. There is evidence such lessons that
include worked examples in which the steps are explicated can be
very effective strategies of instruction (Shen & Tsai, 2009). These
video lessons can be made available in a learning management
system so that students can access them whenever they are needed
and can be repeated whenever they are necessary.
It does appear reasonable to conclude that efficacious IT
managers will be supporting educators as they create more diverse
and flexible learning environments than was necessary for previous
generations of learners. The nature of the experiences central to the
curriculum will determine the nature of the IT systems that are built
and supported. A single approach to using technology in classrooms,
or a single type of technology activity will not suffice for learners to
participate in the emerging information landscape.

Pedagogical Technological Knowledge
The most efficacious development of pedagogical
technological knowledge arises from those situations in which
technologists (who obtain and configure test systems) scale up and
deploy into production those systems that have been examined by
and tested by teachers who identified pedagogical uses. Many of the
information technology tools available in schools were developed
for audiences and purposes other than education. It is only by
investigating emerging technologies and adapting them for teaching
that educators gain pedagogical technological knowledge. Those
systems that appear to have the greatest pedagogical application
with the least consumption of technical resources and the least
extraneous cognitive load are those that deserve greatest attention
and priority.
Consider social media as an example. Originally developed
so that individuals could publish on the Internet (and still widely
56

Efficacious Educational Technology

used for that purpose), many educators have found educationally
relevant tasks that can be accomplished through social media, and
these can be applied to pedagogical problems in many classrooms.
The teacher who finds an excellent solution to a problem in her
classroom (perhaps the biology teacher whose students have built
an excellent model of a cell) can take a picture of the solution, and
post it to a Twitter account. By embedding the feed in her online
classroom, the solutions can become part of the resources for all
students to use. This exemplifies the adoption of easy-to-use and
effective technologies predicted by technology acceptance
(Venkatesh et al., 2003).
Other examples of technologies with unexplored
pedagogical applications include haptic and full-body motion
interfaces (Malinverni & Pares, 2014) which allow for alternatives
to keyboard and mouse inputs and for outputs other than printed
documents or screen displays. Video games that track motions of
bodies have been incorporated into some physical education courses
and this is an example pedagogical technological knowledge
affecting students’ experiences. Virtual reality, in which technology
provides three-dimensional content is another field of developing
pedagogical technological knowledge (Ricordel, Wang, Da Silva, &
Le Callet, 2017). As these technologies become more fully
developed and less expensive, it is anticipated they will become
more widely adopted for educational purposes.

Pedagogical Content Knowledge
Just as each content area has its own combination of
concepts, ideas, and procedures, each has its own collection of
activities that are well-suited to helping students learn that content.
In many content areas, the methods used to teach are the lessons the
teachers intend to teach. In science classes, for example, laboratory
activities in which students plan and set up an apparatus so they can
collect data, which they analyze are engaged in methods that teach
both the content (the activities are designed to demonstrate
important phenomena) and the methods (the activities give
experience setting up experiments and analyzing data). Writing
courses, also, find the boundaries between pedagogy and content
blurred, as the coaching and advice students receive (and give) are
intended to improve their writing as they gain experience writing.
Pedagogical content knowledge is an important aspect of
on-going teacher education. It has been established that the
57

Efficacious Educational Technology

cognitive and learning sciences are continuing to discover important
aspects of pedagogy that were previously unknown and these lead
teachers to adopt new methods or adapt their existing practices, so
pedagogical knowledge is changing. It has also been established that
content is rapidly advancing, so content knowledge is changing
rapidly. As a result, the pedagogy used to teach content during a
teachers’ preparation is likely to be challenged by new discoveries
in the learning and cognitive sciences. The responsibility of
supporting teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge falls largely to
education professionals and leaders such as department leaders and
curriculum leaders, efficacious IT managers will accommodate new
demands and needs that are produced as educators continuously
redesign and recreate their methods to reflect new discoveries.

Technological Content Knowledge
Technology is affecting how discoveries are made, and even
what discoveries can be made, as well as how new knowledge is
constructed in many fields. Consider mathematics-rich fields;
spreadsheets, statistical software, and graphing calculators have
reduced the cognitive demands of manipulating data for recent
generations of workers (and students) in those fields. Further,
citation management tools and online databases containing the fulltext of periodicals has redefined the work of researching in many
fields. During a teachers’ professional preparation, he or she will
gain experience using the tools employed practitioners in his or her
field. In a classroom, many of the same tools will be available and
many familiar tools will be replaced by new ones, so teachers must
continue to develop and refine their technological content
knowledge as it emerges over their careers.
Much technological content knowledge is developed in
small and specialized groups, and it is developed to meet very
specific goals. A group of math teachers, for example, may develop
technological content knowledge around options for graphing
functions on mobile devices. As handheld computers have become
ubiquitous, students are likely to use many different graphing apps
to solve problems. A group of math teachers may plan professional
development time to sit with a collection of the problems they
typically give to their students, and solve them using the many
different devices and applications so they become familiar with the
steps for graphing with different software and hardware options.
After developing this technological content knowledge, they will be
58

Efficacious Educational Technology

better prepared to both assess and evaluate the choices and support
students who may be using different devices. As a result of
improved technological content knowledge, tools that are easier to
use and more effective are likely to be installed by IT managers and
teachers are likely to be more efficacious in helping students use all
tools to learn they content they teach.

Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge
Mishara and Kohler’s (2006) TPCK model differentiates
seven different types of knowledge that are relevant to technologyrich teaching and learning. These are useful in deconstructing
classrooms into aspects that can be developed and improved in
isolation, but efficacious IT managers are cognizant of the fact that
these types of knowledge influence each other. A complete
framework for understanding teaching requires consideration of and
reflection upon all aspects of TPCK; the tools we use (technology),
how we use it (pedagogy), and what we teach with it (content)
combine to create new and opportunities and challenges in the
classrooms.
Efficacious IT managers also recognize that new
understandings in one type of knowledge will create permanent and
irreversible changes in the others, and that once changes in
technology are made, the effects on the others will be permanent and
irreversible. Consider IT managers who deploy a learning
management system (LMS) so that high school teachers can take
advantage of online testing features, resource sharing, and online
discussion tools to support face-to-face instruction. Teachers who
use that LMS are likely to adopt new approaches to teaching and
assessment that are specific for the LMS, but they may find those
expand their effectiveness or improve their efficiency so they
become a permanent part of his or her practice.
Mathematics teachers can point students to web sites where
students can vary the coefficients, exponents, and other constants of
functions and the changes are immediately graphed. When I share
such sites with students, it is common for one or more to observe,
“It is like we were playing with the graphs.” Such a site would affect
the content knowledge introduced in the course, as it allows more
sophisticated functions to be introduced more rapidly than they are
without the technology. These sites also affect pedagogical
knowledge of teachers as it introduces play into a topic that is not
typically amenable to play and exploration.
59

Efficacious Educational Technology

It is also likely that those changes which teachers determine
to be effective will be immediately adopted, they will exert peerbased social pressure on others to adopt it, and school leaders will
exert leader-based pressure all teachers to adopt it. TPCK also
provides a framework for ensuring a technological solution is
extended and expanded only in those setting where they are
appropriate, and inappropriate technology solutions are avoided.
While the playful nature of interactive graphing sites can be useful
for students who are developing a sense of the nature of graphs and
the different effects of each term on the appearance of the graph, but
play is unlikely for be effective when teaching students how to
interpret graphs.
Efficacious IT managers will recognize the different
pedagogical purposes of different technologies. Those who
recommend a single tool for every pedagogical problem (or who
interpret every pedagogical problem as solvable with a particular
technology) are likely to be making decisions and recommendations
for purposes other than teaching and learning. Deploying a single
technology in every setting is an approach to technology planning
that is not supported by leaders who understand TPACK.

Supporting Educators
We know that previous learning is an important factor in
determining how new knowledge is perceived and what actions are
taken in response to new knowledge, so it is reasonable to conclude
that educators’ TPCK begins developing long before they even
begin their professional preparation and it extends throughout their
careers. Efficacious IT managers have a role in ensuring all
educators have opportunities to continue to learn about all types of
knowledge that affect their decisions and actions related to
technology and teaching. This on-going professional learning is
necessary for educators to reconcile their existing practice and
beliefs about teaching and learning and technology with new tools
and discoveries.
While these learning activities sometimes fall within a
single type of knowledge, the goal of all professional learning for
educators should ultimately be undertaken to improve all aspects of
educators’ TPCK. Because TPCK comprises very different types of
knowledge and skill, developing each necessitates different
approaches to professional learning. Efficacious IT managers
understand the differences between and support educators through
60

Efficacious Educational Technology

training, learning, and design activities when each is appropriate.
Further, they provide teachers with autonomy in making decisions
regarding their professional learning when it is appropriate.

Training, Learning, and Design
Three types of learning experiences (training, learning, and
design) are necessary to provide complete support of teachers’
development of TPCK. Training, learning, and design are all
professional development activities, but each is designed for
different purposes and the type of activity depends of the nature of
the desired outcomes.
Training is typically applied to those situations in which
learners (trainees) must be able to perform procedures or actions
after the activity is complete. When new hardware and software is
introduced to classrooms, it is appropriate to train educators in how
to use it. It is designed to overcome extraneous cognitive load and
increase perceived ease of use. Training is typically organized using
instructionist models. In face-to-face training, an expert will lead
participants though procedures from the very basic steps through
increasingly complex uses of the technology. Trainees follow
directions and cues given by the expert, who assumes trainees have
no experience in the tools he or she is to demonstrate (see figure
2.2). In training situations, teachers interact with technology, and
the interaction is mediated through an expert
There are three outcomes of training in professional
development settings for teachers. First, experts seek to make
teachers aware of the capacity of the new system. For example,
when deploying a new learning management system, training will
focus on new or changed functions in the LMS. This is particularly
important when new capacity is similar to existing capacity, such as
differentiating threaded discussions boards from blogs and journals
as tools for interaction in an LMS.
Second, training supports teachers’ understanding of how to
configure different tools. Although the details of how to set each
option in not reasonable in training, it does focus on opening the
configuration tools and being aware of where different options are
found.

61

Efficacious Educational Technology

Figure 2.2. Training: teachers interact with technology, mediated
through an expert
Third, training incorporates strategies for ensuring teachers
can use the systems with independence after the training ends and
this includes resources for further training. Most experienced
trainers understand teachers are a diverse group, so multiple
methods of developing independence are appropriate for training. It
is not unusual for teachers who ask for step-by-step instructions to
spend excessive time in training taking their own notes, so many
trainers prepare only general procedures and encourage teachers to
record the specific steps in language they understand. The
opportunity for independent practice while experts are available for
guidance and advice is another strategy. Yet another is providing
tutorials, annotated screen shots, and video recordings.
Training is often focused on answering questions that begin
with “How do I…?” and these are answered with specific steps or
procedures. Because training is used to support teachers’ knowledge
of steps or procedures, IT managers can define the outcomes that
will determine the success of the training. When participants have
demonstrated a predefined level of capacity to use the technology,
then the training can be deemed complete and successful.

62

Efficacious Educational Technology

Professional development focused on learning provides
teachers with support as they understand the role of a particular
technology in their teaching and instruction. As teachers learn about
technology, they identify curriculum goals that are important and
explore how technology tools can increase the efficiency of
learning, how technology can provide more effective learning
experiences, or how the technology can support a new curriculum
goal (these often arise from new technological content knowledge).
While students are rarely considered when planning and delivering
training, teachers do consider how the technology will affect
students’ experiences when they are learning about technology (see
figure 2.3).

Figure 2.3. Learning; teachers considering technology in light of
students with the expert playing a support role.
When learning, teachers tend to ask the question “Can I…?”
and it is answered with an idea about how technology can be
adopted and adapted to accomplish a curricular goal. Compared to
training, learning about technology is unpredictable; experts can
accurately predict the end products of training, but they cannot
accurately predict what teachers will learn about technology.
Compared to training, the changes in learners are much more
63

Efficacious Educational Technology

dependent on the context in which the new knowledge will be used,
the beliefs and values of the learners, and the purposes of the
learning. Once educators become comfortable they can use a
particular technology, they have proven the system can be operated
and that it can serve a useful or expected function with reasonable
effort, they begin to brainstorm the potential uses of the technology
in the classroom, which is an important process in learning.
Learning is also an activity that can continue with no end.
This is especially true when the purpose of the learning is to improve
performance. Learners may end the process according to a
predefined rule or through the decision to stop, but the rule is
artificially set and does not represent an objective end point. In IT
management, the artificial end of learning happens when the
decision is made that “We understand what we want to do, now it is
time to take action.”
Once teachers are sufficiently familiar with a piece of
technology, learning becomes a design process in which their work
becomes more relevant and focused on refining materials and plans.
In design work, teachers build solutions for the problems and they
produce innovations as new methods for teaching and learning are
created and integrated into classrooms. Design typically becomes an
iterative process as teachers create a solution, then refine it as they
observe how it works in the classroom (see figure 2.4).

Figure 2.4. Design: teachers create IT experiences for students
Eric von Hippel (2005), a scholar who studies technological
innovations, suggested lead users, those individuals who tend to
develop new applications of technology are most productive and
contribute the greatest innovation when they are provided with a
toolkit that affords:

64

Efficacious Educational Technology

• The ability to complete the entire trial and error processThis is particularly important for innovations in education
as designs cannot be tested unless they are used with
learners in the intended situation. While pilot studies can
help refine educational designs, redesigns must be informed
by feedback from classrooms. Frequently, new educational
technology designs are tested with other teachers before
being deployed with students.
• Design within the available solutions space- Solution
spaces are bounded by the controllable aspects of the local
IT systems and budgets. Designs, for example, that require
teachers to use expensive extensions to be added to the LMS
will fall outside the solution space.
• User-friendly tools- When elucidating the technology
acceptance model, Davis (1989) established the role of ease
of use in the intention to use technology. This extends to
toolkits for designing innovations; teachers are more likely
to use tools they find easy-to-use as it is associated with
more efficient work.
• Modular libraries- Modules are components that can be
designed once and then reused for similar projects. A toolkit
that provides this capacity will also lead to greater
innovations in technology-rich teaching and learning.
Mathematics teachers who use a toolkit with a graphing
module can focus their efforts on using the module rather
than recreating it for each course.
Whereas training is led by individuals with expertise and
familiarity with the technology, learning and design tends to be led
by experts in teaching. Etienne Wenger, Nancy White, and John D.
Smith (2009), three scholars well-known for their work to
understand communities of practice, have described a particular
type of technology leader that emerges in many organizations; they
call these individuals technology stewards. According to Wenger,
White, and Smith; technology stewards are individuals who develop
expertise adapting technology to achieve the strategic goals of the
organization. In education, we expect technology stewards to be
educators who develop greater than usual expertise using
technology and the ability to share their expertise with others.
65

Efficacious Educational Technology

Because they understand the needs and the expectations of
the members of the organization, technology stewards are given
greater authority in technology decisions, and play an active role in
evaluating tools and changes that are under consideration. In the
often-used progression of technology projects, technology stewards
are involved in determining the proof-of-concept which establishes
a technology solution is possible; their advice usually determines
which technology projects enter the proof-of-concept stage of
planning. They are also involved in alpha testing (which finds a
small group of experts determining if the systems provide necessary
functionality) and supporting beta testing (which finds the first end
users trying the system and providing feedback), and they serve as
a liaison between educators who test systems and the technology
professionals who will redesign systems to reflect what is learned
during tests. When a system moves into production, technology
stewards are active in training users, and helping them learn to use
the systems, and design activities using technology. In many cases
technology integration specialists will fill this role, but the focus of
technology stewards’ efforts is as much towards technologist and
the decision they make and systems they build as it is on the decision
teachers make.

Autonomy and its Limits in Professional Learning
Educators appear to have an incomplete and inconsistence
awareness of autonomy as a factor that affects learning. Blumenfeld,
Kempler, and Krajik (2006) define autonomy to include the
“perception of a sense of agency, which occurs when students have
the opportunity for choices and for playing a significant role in
directing their own activity” (p. 477). Autonomy is implicit in many
of the pedagogical strategies that are replacing the Standard Model
and that are associated with 21st century skills. It is reasoned that
learners who have autonomy are more motivated to study and more
engaged with the curriculum than those who have little autonomy.
Autonomous individuals approach situations with:
• The ability to recognize a problem, which is typically a gap
between the current state and the desired state;
• Knowledge of how to resolve the problem or close that gap;
• The capacity to solve the problem or close the gap;
66

Efficacious Educational Technology

• The authority to implement their solution.
Despite the value of autonomy in creating classroom that promote
deeper learning, there is evidence teachers are allowed to exert little
autonomy over instructional practices (Range, Pijanowski, Duncan,
Scherz, & Hvidston, 2014).
A limit to autonomy in IT management in schools is that the
four aspects of autonomy are controlled by different individuals.
Problems or gaps related to teaching and learning must be identified
by teachers; knowledge of how to resolve problems must emerge
from teachers and technology experts as they design and test IT
systems. The capacity to scale test systems into production systems
that can be managed with the available resources must be done by
IT professionals, and authority to decided which solutions to
implement is assigned to school leaders. Efficacious IT
management has been constructed as a collaborative endeavor, thus
it will lead to greater autonomy, even if it is filtered through others
involved with ensures actions are appropriate, proper, and
reasonable.
Compared to users of IT in other organizations, teachers do
appear to require greater autonomy in technology decisions (Hu,
Clark, & Ma, 2003; Teo, 2011), as educators generally are more
independent users of IT and use a greater variety of applications and
data sources than information workers in other fields, and they are
more likely than users in other organizations to test new applications
and data sources for usefulness. Autonomous educators who explore
and discover effective uses of IT in their classrooms, must have
procedures through which their new learning can be translated into
IT systems that are available and supported by the IT management
team.
Autonomy is a complex variable that affects decisionmaking and professional activity in a variety of ways. As will be
explained in Chapter 8: Understanding Change, autonomy is
necessary for change to occur, but individuals who exert autonomy
may also reject the vision, direction, or structure of leaders who seek
to affect change.

67

CHAPTER 3: ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT COMPUTING DEVICES

Technology-rich teaching and learning occurs only in those
schools in which IT that has the capacity to perform the task
is available and functioning. In recent years, the nature of
devices available to the education market has changed, so IT
managers deciding what to purchase and how to disperse it in
the school. face more and more complicated options than they
did previously. The factors that affect these decisions are
explored in this chapter.

Computers are systems in the true sense of the word. For
several decades, “computer” meant a box that rested on a desk; users
controlled software that was installed on a disk inside that box and
they created information by means of a keyboard and a mouse that
were plugged into the box. The user saw output on a video monitor
and sent output to a printer; those peripherals were also attached to
the box. A surprisingly small computer chip was inside the box and
microscopic circuits on that chips is where information was
processed. That processor, along with random access memory
(RAM), disk drives that stored information, and all of the input and
output peripherals were all attached to a circuit board (called the
motherboard). The peripherals are largely what give computer
systems their capacity to facilitate teaching and learning. They have
expanded in recent years and now include printers, 3D printers,
network cards, video cards, sound cards, and all other input and
output devices (of course with the increasing use of networks many
input and output devices have been replaced with files transferred to
and from other computers via networks). The various hardware and

Efficacious Educational Technology

software components installed on a computer affect what can be
done with the system and each component affects the operation of
the others. Together they create a system; the whole is greater than
the sum of the parts.

Logistic Goal
Technology-rich teaching and learning requires students
use computing devices, so school IT managers will define a logistic
goal such as “Students and teachers will have sufficient access to
computing devices that are sufficient for the curriculum and learning
activities.” (The redundancy of the word “sufficient” in this logistic
goal is recognized. It will be demonstrated that sufficiency can take
many meanings and many factors affect what constitutes sufficient
IT.)

Content of the Logistic Goal
In schools, sufficiency depends on the capacity of the
systems to manage and process the information necessary to
complete the task assigned to the learner, the number of devices
available, and the capacity of the teacher to implement the plans
they have designed. Improving any one of those factors can increase
sufficiency; because schools rarely have inexhaustible resources, IT
managers often find they must negotiate sufficiency.

Capacity of Devices
Teaching and learning requires students access and
consume information, analyze and manipulate it, and create and
disseminate it. Some educationally relevant information tasks, such
as consuming text-based web sites (e.g. Wikipedia) and composing
text (e.g. writing research papers) require little computing capacity.
The rate of data creation is a small, so the necessary processing
power is minimal, and the output is simple enough that a lowresolution display, and minimal network connection allows the
work to be completed with no impediments caused by the
technology. Other information tasks central to the curriculum, such
as consuming or creating video require much greater computing
capacity as the amount of data necessary to encode video is far

69

Efficacious Educational Technology

greater than transferred for text. A device that is sufficient for a textbased activity may be insufficient for a video-based activity.
The capacity of a computer determines the nature of the
information tasks that can be accomplished with it. Systems with
greater capacity can process more data in a shorter time so users can
use more sophisticated data sources and create more sophisticated
data products using systems. When one attempts to use a computer
with insufficient capacity, the computer is likely to “freeze” as it
becomes unresponsive and many software features stop working.
When a computer freezes repeatedly during a task, it lacks the
capacity to perform the task.
Capacity is determined by several factors. In general, these
factors determine the rate at which a system can access, process, and
display information. Devices must be evaluated relative to a
particular need, and IT managers will determine the capacity of the
systems by evaluating:
• The speed at which the computer can process informationProcessing speed is measured in giga-hertz (GHz); a
processor operating at a speed of 3 GHz can perform
3,000,000,000 operations in one second. For the first
generation of IT managers in schools, the processing speed
of the computers was important as it determined the
performance of the machines. For most of the 21st century,
IT managers have been more concerned with the number of
processors installed in parallel on the systems they
purchase. The increasing processing capacity of computers
has been referred to as Moore’s Law, and it has continued
unabated for more than 50 years.
• The amount of random access memory (RAM) available to
the processor- RAM has always been important in
determining the capacity of a computer. It is relatively
cheap and easy to increase, so RAM upgrades are a common
method of increasing the capacity of computers. For some
devices and for some purposes, however, increasing the
RAM will have little effect on the perceived performance of
the system. For example, if a student is using a computer
that has 4 GB RAM installed to access G Suite and its
performance is adequate, then doubling the RAM to 8 GB
is unlikely to provide any better performance.
70

• The efficiency of the operating system- The OS manages
memory and other system resources, and the rate at which
it performs these tasks affects users’ perception of the
computer’s performance. Over time, updates and changes
to the operating system can decrease its efficiency and
computer systems on which excessive applications or
extensions to the operating system or web browsers can also
interfere with operating system efficiency.
• The sophistication of the applications- Applications are the
software used to manage and create information; many
appicatons are sold in different versions. For example,
schools can install and support various levels of video
editing software. IT users can select from simple video
editing software (sometimes packaged with the operating
system) up to the same software used by professional video
editors. Professional level software provides very
sophisticated functions, but it requires hardware be
upgraded frequently and it requires time and effort to use at
its fullest capacity.
• The data rate at which the system can send and receive
information on networks- This factor is increasingly a
determinate of sufficiency. For many users, the capacity of
computing devices is less about information processing and
more about interaction enabling. Access to networks also
expands the information capacity of our devices.; we update
our software through the network and we move photographs
from our devices onto network storage systems to free
memory for more images (for example).
These variable aspects of computing systems that determine
its capacity cannot be considered in isolation, as each contributes to
the others. Consider the smartphones that many of teachers and
students carry into school in their pockets. These are the latest in a
series of “pocket-sized” technologies that have been evolving for
decades and these have evolved together with networks. The
processing speed and memory in pocket-sized devices exceeds that
available in desktop computers manufactured only a few years ago,
they connect to networks that make multimedia content available,
71

Efficacious Educational Technology

and they allow users to create and share multimedia content with
little effort. These devices have evolved through a combination of
manufacturer push and consumer pull; as devices made more tasks
possible, the demand for the products increased and motivated
manufacturers to further improve and expand the devices they sold.
Perhaps the best example of this effect is the co-evolution of the
displays and the network capacity to access video. Better networks
afforded users capacity to receives video and improved displays
make the viewing experience acceptable which increased the
demand for networks capable of delivering video to users of mobile
devices.
The reality of evaluating device capacity is even more
complex than presented, as even more factors affect the capacity of
some devices and the all of these factors continue to evolve. The
battery technology necessary to power the devices in our pockets is
one example. Improvements in batteries means they can to power
devices longer than previous generations of batteries and they
recharge more quickly. Network security is another. Engineers are
developing more sophisticated methods of securing the networks we
use and the data we store on them. Like other technologies, these
methods are being refined through market pull and industry push but
also through reaction to threats posed by the devices themselves and
by misuse of the devices. The Internet of things (IoT) is the label
given to the growing range of consumer devices that are connected
to the Internet, and the IoT represents a vastly extended collection
of source of input for computing systems, and it is possible because
of increasing capacity of processors, expanding wireless networks,
and decreasing size of circuits that has contributed to the mobility
of technology.
Despite the evolution of a greater diversity of computing
devices, which is likely to continue into the foreseeable future,
schools are likely to be places where the original model of
computing will continue to dominate technology-rich activity.
Learning will find students accessing information, composing text,
and creating media using general computing devices managed by
the school and running software supported by the school. The fleets
of devices managed by school IT professionals will be more diverse
than the fleets managed by previous generations of IT managers.
They will obtain, configure and install, manage and support
computers with full operating systems, devices with mobile
operating systems, and Internet-only notebooks.
72

Efficacious Educational Technology

Systems with Full Operating Systems.
Of the devices marketed to schools, those with the greatest
computing capacity will arrive with full operating system installed
on the hard drive. Full operating systems include Windows, the
Macintosh OS, and Linux (and open source operating system that
can be used for free) which are installed on desktop and laptop
computers. Of the devices on the market at any moment, these will
have the most processing power (with both the fastest and the most
parallel processors), the greatest RAM, and support the most
sophisticated applications.
Full operating systems are available in multiple versions,
and publishers will maintain the versions for several years;
eventually operating systems reach the end of life when the
publisher no longer releases security updates. In addition to the
versions of the operating systems installed on user devices, there are
versions of these operating systems available for servers as well as
for mobile devices. Full operating systems are designed to connect
to servers and, together, the OS on the users’ device and the network
OS provide the most flexibility and most control of the software
environment for IT professionals. They can be configured to use
network resources, allow for multiple user profiles, and support
network-based management. Obviously, the price of a unit will vary
depending on the specifications, but IT managers who are asked
about the cost of obtaining new machines that arrive with a full
operating system are likely to estimate $1000 per unit.
These devices tend to have the greatest longevity of all of
the computing devices available in schools. It is not unusual to find
desktop computers still operating and providing educationally
relevant functionality more than five years after they were first
purchased and installed. Laptop models tend to last less than five
years, as they get damaged through rough use compared to desktop
models. Decreasing performance of batteries and other components
also limit the functional lifespan of laptop computers as well. Over
the life of a computer with a full operating system, users will find it
is characterized by decreasing performance as operating system and
application updates require more system resources. IT managers
accommodate for this by decreasing the number of applications
installed, so it can continue to be used for tasks requiring the least
capacity.
The rationale for purchasing systems with full operating
systems is typically grounded in the sophistication of the software
73

Efficacious Educational Technology

that can be used on these devices. Students using a computer with a
full operating system can use the same software that is used by
professionals, so they can create sophisticated products. Further,
they can use sophisticated output devices and peripherals. That
software and those peripherals both add to the cost of the systems,
but in many cases, that cost is necessary to provide the computing
capacity necessary to meet the goals of the courses in which students
are enrolled.
Consider, for example, a high school in which theatre
students write and produce one-act plays. Teachers may be
interested in having students record the performance on multiple
cameras, then use those recordings to create a single video version
of the performance that incorporates different views. Editing and
rendering such a video requires sophisticated video editing software
that can be used only on a computer with a full operating system. In
addition, the size of the files that must be managed to produce and
render such a project require the processing power and the amounts
of memory that are available only on a relatively expensive
computer system with a full operating system installed.

Mobile Operating System.
The two mobile operating systems that dominate the
consumer and education markets are Apple’s iOS (which is installed
on iPads and iPhones) and Google’s Android (which is installed on
a range of tablets and phones). Microsoft makes a version of
Windows available for mobile devices and the open source
community also makes version of Linux available, but these are
much as less-widely used than iOS and Android. Mobile operating
systems do allow users to adjust the settings and configurations, but
these devices feature a single user profile on the device, so the
changes that are made affect everyone who uses the device; this fact
limits the usefulness of mobile devices in some schools. It is not
unusual or IT professionals to find school leaders become strong
advocates for purchasing mobile devices once they realize the ease
of use that characterizes mobile devices. Those school leaders are
not always fully aware of the difficulty of managing devices
intended for single users in a school where devices are used by many
different users for many different purposes.
Among the populations that have found the greatest success
using tablet computers that use mobile operating systems are those
educators who work with special education students. A number of
74

Efficacious Educational Technology

factors, including the mobility of the devices, the individualization
that is possible with the apps installed on the devices, the
multimedia nature of the devices, and the haptic control are all
features that have been identified as useful for this particular
population of students.
Devices with mobile operating systems tend to be more
affordable than those with full operating systems. Depending on the
size of the screen and the quality of display and size of the memory,
the same IT manager who estimated $1000 per unit for desktops or
laptops would probably estimate $400 per unit that uses a mobile
operating system, but he or she would be hesitant to make a final
estimate before the option for managing the devices was specified.
For example, some IT managers who purchase iPads decide to
purchase a desktop computer and reserve it for the purpose of
managing the devices through a third-party system.
A further concern for deploying devices with mobile
operating systems is the capacity of the wireless network. Mobile
devices are designed to function the best when they are connected
to the Internet. While users can take pictures, record video, create
documents, and otherwise be productive on a mobile device with no
network connection, there are limited options for adding software,
sharing files, and otherwise using the devices when they are not
connected to the Internet.

Internet-only Operating Systems
The newest type of device to enter the educational market
is the Internet-only notebook. When these devices were first
marketed, they had no functionality without the Internet, but later
generations have added some offline functionality. Still, however,
these devices are most useful in schools when they are connected to
the Internet.
The dominant device used in school that uses an Internetonly operating system is the Chromebook which is available from
many manufacturers and in several configurations, but that all use
the Google Chrome OS. With this device, one logs on to the device
and the Internet simultaneously using a Google account. The only
applications installed on the notebook is Google Chrome, which is
the popular web browser. Productivity software (such as the word
processor, spreadsheet, and presentation software) is provided
through the user’s G Suite account; all other productivity tools that
are used on the Chromebook must be available via a web service.
75

Efficacious Educational Technology

There are limited options for using peripherals on a Chromebook,
and printing is managed through Google’s Cloud Printing service.
This service requires an administrator of the school’s Google
Domain to configure a computer to be the print server, and it accepts
and processes print jobs from any user assigned to the cloud printer.
Managing a fleet of Chromebooks in a school finds an IT
professional logging on to the online administrative dashboard
provided by Google and selecting for the options available from
Google or from third-party publishers; Google has a history of
providing both G Suite and Chromebook management tools at no
cost to schools, but many third-party services require a paid
subscription. In addition to being limited by the options provided by
Google and its partners, the decision to purchase Internet-only
devices for students and teachers makes a functioning wireless
network absolutely necessary in a school.
Of the three types of devices marketed to school IT
managers, Internet-only notebooks are the most affordable. The IT
manager making a rough estimate of the cost would likely give $300
as a price per unit. That estimate would depend, of course, on the
capacity of the wireless network in the school where to devices were
to be deployed. The actually cost of deployed functional Internetonly devices may depend on upgrading network capacity.

Availability of Devices
While an undergraduate student studying science education,
I judged a science fair at a middle school located near the university
where I studied. In my journal, I noted, “Students had printed graphs
of their results and taped them on their displays.” I also recorded my
conversation with the teacher, “she said they drew their graphs on
paper, and then when she had approved them, they went to make
them on the computer and printed them out.” I also had a sketch of
one of the science classrooms which showed the location of the two
desktop computers on the counter in the back of the room. In the
same journal, I recorded a visit to another school a year later; during
that trip, I joined a teacher with her students in the computer room.
I observed, “students work in pairs on their Oregon Trail trip, taking
notes on their trip;” the students then used those notes to compose a
narrative of their voyage. My record of the conversation with the
teacher detailed, “the Westward Expansion social studies unit is

76

Efficacious Educational Technology

three weeks long and the students work on this during our time in
the computer room.”
In those two cases from the mid-1980’s, we see computers
being relatively marginalized and specialized part of the curriculum.
In both cases, there was a very specific purpose of using computers,
and the teachers played an active role in scheduling and controlling
access to the machines. In the graphing example the teacher appears
to have deliberately slowed the process of digitizing the graphs by
insisting they be approved on a paper copy before the students
accessed the computer. In the Oregon Trail example, the role of the
computers in the curriculum was different as all students were using
computers at the same time, and I noted in my journal, “the teacher
encouraged students to work quickly as this was the last day in the
lab.”
Those cases also illustrate one of the first major transitions
in how computers were made available to students in schools. When
they first arrived, desktop computers were installed one or two at a
time in the classrooms of teachers who wanted them. Once installed,
they were used in ways the teachers directed, and students used the
computers while classmates were engaged in non-computer
activities. This model is illustrated in the graphing example. As
computers arrived in larger numbers, and the demand for instruction
about computers increased, large numbers of computers were
installed in special classrooms (usually rooms that had been retrofit
with additional electrical receptacles). Once computer rooms were
installed, the model of technology-based teaching changed.
Teachers would “take their classes to the computer room,” and all
students would use computers at the same time (usually for the same
purpose), and no student used them until the class returned to the
computer room during their next scheduled session.
Around the turn of the century, it was reasoned that students
needed experience using computers in their classrooms where their
other learning materials were located and to demonstrate the
computers were useful for all learning not simply for specialized
activities. “Technology integration” became the preferred model of
technology-rich teaching. Technology integration was possible
because of the coincident maturing of mobile computers and
wireless Ethernet, so the computers that were moved into
classrooms could be connected to the network. Of course, one
cannot ascertain which of these was the motivating factor, but

77

Efficacious Educational Technology

technology integration, mobile computers, and wireless Ethernet all
arrived in schools at about the same time.
In the 21st century, it is common for IT managers to provide
computers to teachers and students in three ways. Computer rooms,
both (in-place and mobile), one-to-one initiatives, and bring your
own device initiatives. Each has implications for IT management
and for technology-rich teaching and learning.

Computer Rooms and Other Common Resources
While computer rooms have largely fallen out of favor, they
continue to be maintained in many schools. As more diverse
computing devices have entered the educational market and
Internet-only notebooks became more popular, computer rooms
have become more important for providing capacity for specialized
purposes that require sophisticated software that must be installed
on devices with full operating systems installed and that meet other
hardware requirements.
For example, high school students working on the school
newspaper may use their smartphones to capture images and draft
stories using G Suite which is accessed via Chromebooks. When the
students prepare the newspaper to print, however, they will use
desktop publishing software that is installed on workstations in a
computer room. That software allows for far greater control over the
layout of the printed newspaper (and the production of electronic
editions) than is possible to devices with less capacity that are used
for early drafts of articles. Both are necessary for producing the final
product.
While some computer rooms are filled with newer desktop
computers with the greatest capacity of the various machines
deployed in the school, other computer rooms are filled with the
oldest machines. In schools, IT managers tend to extend the life of
devices as long as possible to ensure long-term value from the
purchase, so older computers are nursed along with little software
installed and provide minimal, but still useful, functionality.
Teachers whose students need to find information on the Internet or
who need to create word processor documents, presentations, or
spreadsheets may find a five-year-old desktop computer with only
an office suite installed to be perfectly sufficient. Some faculty even
prefer to use such systems with their students as they provide fewer
distractions to students than systems with more tools installed.
78

Efficacious Educational Technology

One strategy that has become popular (among some IT
professionals in schools) for leaving computers in service when the
operating system is no longer supported is to install Linux on the
computers. Linux is an open source operating system, so it can be
installed without paying licensing fees, and it tends to be updated by
the community indefinitely, and it (generally) requires less
processing capacity than commercially available operating systems,
so it can stay in service longer and on older machines. A teacher
who creates a valuable lesson using a particular Linux application
will find it continues to be available, in an unchanged form for as
long as the computers are functional. A teacher who creates a similar
lesson using a web-based application or a commercial operating
system may find the site removed or the application becomes
incompatible with the operating system before he finds a more
suitable replacement.
Even in one-to-one environments, there are situations in
which teacher must share computing resources. This can include
computers with full operating systems, specialty printers, high
resolution projectors and similar devices. Such devices that cannot
be provided in indefinite numbers must be shared among teachers.
The need to share and access to those resources and schedule time
and activities so that everyone has similar access is a part of
managing the technology-rich classroom. Sufficiency decisions
must be made with the respect to the other demands of financial and
support resources, and one support system that must be maintained
by the IT professionals is a public system for viewing schedules and
reserving time to use shared devices. It is reasonable to insist such
schedules be available and that teachers use them.

One-to-one Initiatives
The state of Maine, in the northeastern United States, is
widely recognized as the first large jurisdictions to implement a oneto-one initiative when the state purchased Macintosh laptops for
each seventh-grade student starting in 2002. The rationale behind
one-to-one initiatives is that it ensures all students will have access
to a computer at all times and in all places in the school. One-to-one
initiatives have become more widespread as Internet-only devices
(which we have seen are a fraction of the cost of laptop computers)
have become more popular. Beginning a one-to-one initiative does
introduce several complications into IT management.
79

Efficacious Educational Technology

Some IT managers deploy on-site one-to-one initiatives,
which means each student is assigned a device, but it stays at school.
While this does minimize the risk to damage of devices while they
are being transported and loss of devices (or power supplies) when
they are off campus, it does restrict the technology-rich activities to
the school building.
A reasonable case can be made that on-site one-to-one
initiatives put disadvantaged populations at a further disadvantage.
If the one-to-one device is the only computer to which the student
has access, and if access to the device is needed for off-campus
learning, then restricting a students’ use can limit his or her
opportunity for an education. One-to-one initiatives that deploy
Internet-only devices can also be criticized because of the demand
it puts on families to purchase Internet access and to install a
wireless network at home, so the school’s device can be used (to its
full capacity) there. Further, if individual students do not have
devices (because it is not charged, or it is broken, or has been taken
away for violating the acceptable use policy), then the student’s
ability to engage with the curriculum may be diminished.
When deploying devices one-to-one, IT managers also take
care in writing and communicating a clear acceptable use policy.
This is especially important with devices that are taken home, and
are going to be used on networks and in settings that are not
protected and managed in the same way that a school network is.
IT managers also must plan steps to improve technology
support so one-to-one devices are repaired quickly. These steps
include seemingly simple, but often overlooked, steps such as
providing power strips so laptops can be used even if they are not
charged, and purchasing extra devices so spares can be deployed
while malfunctioning devices are repaired. Many schools that
deploy one-to-one initiatives will configure the devices so that files
saved on the local disk drive are automatically synchronized with a
cloud storage system (such as G Suite) which minimizes loss of data
when computers fail. All of these support steps can increase the total
cost of owning devices in ways that are not predicted when the
initiative begins.

Bring Your Own Device
While a one-to-one initiative is designed to ensure that all
students have consistent access to a computing device that is
provided by the school, bring your own device (BYOD) initiatives
80

Efficacious Educational Technology

are those designed to deploy a one-to-one initiative in which
students and their families purchase and own the devices they bring
to school and use to interact with the curriculum. These efforts are
grounded in the observation that students arrive in school with
smartphones and laptops, and there is even evidence suggesting
parents are willing to provide devices for their children to use in
school (Grunwald Associates LLC, 2013). Deploying a BYOD
initiative does have important implications for both teachers and for
IT managers.
First, because the device is not owned by the school, IT
managers can exert minimal control over what software is installed.
Consider the mathematics teacher teaching in a BYOD
environment. She may encourage students to use their devices to
graph functions. While she may have a preferred tool, students may
arrive to class with a variety of graphing tools installed on their
devices, so she may face the challenge of supporting students as they
use many different tools. Further, students may be less able to help
each other if they are using different tools. Of course, some perceive
this to be an advantage of a BYOD initiative, as students are likely
to be exposed to many different tools for (in this case) graphing
functions, so they are becoming more adaptive users of technology
than if they are taught on a single device. This situation can also
motivate professional development such as that described in
“Chapter 2: Technology-Rich Teaching and Learning.”
Second is the problem of providing software. A teacher who
has prepared a template for an assignment using Microsoft Word,
for example, may find that students who do not have that program
installed on their devices may be unable to work with the template.
Either the teacher must make the resources available in a manner
that can be opened by every device, or Word must be provided to
every student and on every device. While the common use of cloudbased productivity suites (see “Chapter 5: Web Services”) is
minimizing the instances of the problem, it remains and can be
problematic, especially if learning activities include tasks that
require the advanced features of applications.
Third, the school has little control over how the device is
configured, so BYOD can increase the need for malware protection
and other steps to ensure the security of the network and the school’s
data. In many BYOD environments, procedures are in place for
ensuring devices that connect to the school’s network meet
minimum security standards, and network administrators in these
81

Efficacious Educational Technology

schools are prepared to prevent devices known to be malicious from
connecting to the network.
Finally, the expectation of support can be problematic in
BYOD situations. Technicians employed by the school cannot be
expected to provide troubleshooting and repair services for the
diverse collection of devices used in a BYOD school. Further the
school must assume liability for damage done when their employees
provide service. The result is that BYOD initiatives may find
students without devices as they await repairs by other technicians,
and they may find their devices quarantined from the school
network if it is found to be the source of malware. These can all limit
students’ access to devices that may be necessary for their
education.

The Reality
In the preceding sections, several models of dispersing
computing devices in school have been presented. It is unusual to
find schools in which a single method is used. Especially as Internetonly devices have been purchased, computer rooms are maintained
for projects necessitating greater capacity, and many educators use
mobile devices for professional purposes (and encourage their
students to use mobile devices for educational purposes). Consider
Riverside School, a hypothetical small rural school enrolling
students in grades 7-12. Riverside has a one-to-one program for
students in grades 9-12; each high school student is given a laptop
with the Windows operating system installed and full productivity
suites, along with a host of other tools that are used in specific
content areas. About 15% of the students decide to provide their
own device (usually a Macintosh laptop) rather than using the
computer supplied by the school. The IT managers have purchased
“take home rights” for some software titles, so students can install
licenses purchased by the school on their own computers while they
continue to be enrolled, and students are pointed to open source
software to install for some classroom activities. In addition, there
are carts with laptops shared amongst the classrooms in each wing
of the school; those laptops are used primarily by students in the
middle school grades who are not yet included in the one-to-one
initiative.
Further, there are two computer rooms in the school. One is
located in the library and it is filled with older machines nearing the
end of their life. These desktop models are used for accessing
82

Efficacious Educational Technology

Internet, including G Suite, the school’s cloud-based productivity
tool. Some teachers prefer to use that space rather than laptops in
their classrooms as the library affords more space. The other
computer room is filled with 16 newer and more powerful desktop
computers than those available in the library. That space is used
primarily for desktop publishing, digital photography and video
projects, and other specialized courses and projects. This leaves
teachers with options. They can choose the system that meets their
need, and the needs of all users can be met with minimal disruption.

Capacity of Teachers
To this point in the book, teachers’ technological
pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) (Mishra & Kohler, 2006)
been proposed as a theoretical framework that affects teachers’
understanding of technology and its role in the classroom. It is
reasoned that teachers who have access to sufficient devices and
who have developed sufficient TPCK will use technology for
teaching and learning. This is not always, the case, however.
Baldwin and Ford (1988) suggested the transfer of lessons learned
in training to action depends on a) the training design, b) characters
of the individuals, c) and the work environment. Among the most
important aspects of work environment that determine the degree to
which training and new learning leads to changes in professional
action is the availability of mentors and the availability of resources.
Efficacious IT managers will employ professionals who serve as
mentors to teachers and also support systems whereby curriculum
and instruction resources can be stored and shared.

Technology Integration Specialists
For decades, those responsible for organizing and
presenting in-service professional development for educators have
used a variety of models for providing learning experiences for
teachers, and these have been designed to support all aspects of
TPCK and to accommodate the needs of individual learners. These
activities tended to reflect training in other professional
organizations (especially for technological knowledge) and
graduate courses (especially for pedagogical and content
knowledge), so the professional learning occurred largely outside of
the classroom and in the absence of students. In recent decades,
professionals who are given various titles but who function as
83

Efficacious Educational Technology

technology integration specialists have emerged as a specialty
within the teaching workforce. These individuals are typically
licensed educators who have received additional training (often
earning advanced degrees) in educational technology. These
individuals play active roles in as technology stewards (Wenger,
Smith, & White, 2009) who advocate for technology solutions
aligned with teachers needs and they also fill the role of lead user
(von Hippel, 2005) who create innovative uses of technology in the
classroom and disperse those innovations.
Mentors with greater than usual expertise have been found
to be a characteristic of communities and organizations in which
innovations are accepted and diffused. Eric von Hippel (2005), a
scholar who studies innovation in diverse organizations and fields,
notes lead users “are ahead of the majority of users in their
populations with respect to an important market trend, and they
expect to gain relatively high benefits from a solution to the needs
hey have encountered there” (p. 4).
Technology integration specialists who serve the role of
mentor participate in planning and delivering training, promote
learning about the role of technology in learning, and support design
efforts. In addition, these professionals play an active role in
modeling and coaching mentees. Technology integration specialists
are often found in classrooms (or computer rooms) when teachers
are using technology for teaching and learning. In this role, he or
she supports both the teacher and students in their activities. In some
instances, these specialists will even teach classes (or co-teach), so
the teacher can find a comfortable entry point into using technology.
In idealized circumstances, technology integration
specialists spend most of their time supporting colleagues as they
become competent and confident so they develop as independent
users of and teachers with technology. Three common obstacles do
interfere with the work. First, especially in smaller schools, a
technology integration specialist may have fill this role on a parttime basis and have other teaching responsibilities. This can
introduce scheduling conflicts that can limit opportunities to work
with some other teachers. Second, the personal characteristics of
some teachers may lead him or her to become dependent on the
support of the technology integration specialists. Self-efficacy has
been widely studied and appears to affect the intention to use
technology and the transfer of that into practice (Abbitt, 2011;
Yerdelen-Damar, Boz, & Aydın-Günbatar, 2017), and there is
84

Efficacious Educational Technology

tendency among those with low perceived self-efficacy to rely on
support to meet minimal technology expectations for their
classrooms.
Third, because technology integration specialists are among
the most visible technology professionals in the school, they are
often the first contact for initial troubleshooting help. While this
often leads to quick repairs and can lead to opportunities for both
students and teachers to receive lessons in troubleshooting, this
work does direct technology integration specialists away from their
primary responsibility of mentoring teachers.
A final mentoring role for technology integration specialists
is to support IT professionals as they develop experience creating
systems to meet the unfamiliar needs of educational populations.
They advocate for teachers’ and students’ needs when IT
professionals are designing and configuring IT systems, and they
interpret educational users’ experience so the IT professionals
understand unmet needs and systems that are perceived to be too
difficult to use or ineffective.

Curriculum Repositories
Teachers’ capacity to use technology in classrooms is also
improved by the easy availability of technology-based activities and
lessons that are aligned with their curriculum needs. Dexter,
Morgan, Jones, Meyer (2016) observed that accessible resources
(those that could be incorporated into classrooms with minimal
adaptation) were associated with greater use of technologies. This
led those scholars to conclude, “leaders must provide unfettered
access to technologies beyond personal computers… and provide
learning experience in the pedagogical strategies that support
integration those technologies into teachers’ instruction” p. 1208).
Curriculum repositories (Ackerman, 2017) are systems that
facilitate sharing of resources and strategies among the
professionals working a local community.
A curriculum repository is an online space, typically a
course created in the learning management system provided by the
school, where educators can engage with each other to find and
create resources to support all types of TPCK. Training that is part
of on-boarding new teachers is necessary so they are prepared to use
those systems; by posting the materials used during those training
sessions to the curriculum repository, IT managers can make the
repository a valuable resource for educators when they first arrive.
85

Efficacious Educational Technology

Curriculum repositories are often modeled after existing
open education resource (OER) communities. Several communities
of OER developers have created web sites where visitors can search
for and find documents, media, simulations, and other resources
created by members. These sites are available to general users of the
Internet, and membership is lightly restricted, so these tend to be
vast and rich repositories that many users find them overwhelming.
Curriculum repositories are modeled after OER sites as users can
upload and curate and share resources, but the collections are more
limited and participation is restricted to teachers (and others) in local
communities, so the resources tend to me more closely aligned with
specific curriculum expectations and the they tend to be created by
individuals with similar technology available.

Negotiating Capacity
This chapter focuses on the need for efficacious IT
managers to provide access to sufficient devices so that teaching and
learning needs can be met. Sufficiency is a complex concept
grounded in:
• The number of devices that are available (too few impedes
sufficiency);
• The nature of the devices (to little capacity impedes
sufficiency);
• The manner in which the devices as available (more
inflexible options limits sufficiency);
• The preparation of teachers and the support they receive
(teachers who lack the competence or confidence to use
technology impede sufficiency).
Each of these factors can be limited (for example by budgets
or other resources), so the sufficiency of devices is often negotiated,
and IT managers seek to improve access to minimize the adverse
effects of these negotiations on teaching and learning.

86

Price versus Capacity
When making purchase decisions, IT professionals must
negotiate cost and capacity. In general, devices that have greater
capacity are more expensive; this can be seen in comparing the cost
and capacity of devices with full operating systems (most expensive
and greatest capacity) with Internet-only devices (least expensive
and least capacity). There is an inverse relationship between cost
and capacity and the number of devices that can be obtained per unit
of a budget. Using $1000 as the estimated price per unit of devices
with full operating systems and $400 as the estimated process per
unit of Internet-only notebooks, IT managers would budget $25,000
for a classroom full of computers, but only $10,000 for the same
number of Internet-only devices.
While the lesser cost of the Internet-only devices may
motivate IT managers to opt to purchase those devices, they are
going to provide limited capacity on each device. The result is that
IT manager must reconcile financial considerations with
educational considerations. To avoid limiting educational options
through their technology decisions while also minimizing the cost
of purchasing devices with greater capacity than is necessary, IT
managers can diversity the fleet of devices they manger. They can
purchase a large number of inexpensive devices with minimal
capacity, and small number of devices with greater capacity. This
strategy makes the most devices available for the least demanding
(but most frequent) information tasks (such as using word
processors) while also making some devices available for the most
demanding (but least frequent) information tasks.
Further, those devices will affect decisions about the
network, and may result in changes to how technology personnel do
their work. In all cases, it is the instructional users who must decide
the sufficiency of access. School and technology leaders who reject
decisions that emerge from instructional users must take
responsibility and be transparent. If the devices are “too expensive,”
then the school leaders must articulate that and defend the decision.
If devices are “too complicated” to install and maintain with the
current level of knowledge or staffing, then that rationale must be
made clear, and school leaders must support IT professionals so they
can manage the systems teachers need.
There are no heuristics that can be used to determine what
is appropriate levels of and types of technology useful for students,
and in many cases, a diverse fleet of devices affords the greatest
87

Efficacious Educational Technology

pedagogical uses, but requires the greatest expertise for managing
it. As a student proceeds through her day in a typical high school,
she may encounter a variety of information tasks that each require a
different type of device.

Capacity versus Information Task
Another common negotiation is between the available
capacity and the nature of the information task in the curriculum. In
situations in which the complexity of the information task is beyond
the capacity of the devices, teachers may reconcile the complexity
of the tasks with the capacity of the devices. Consider video editing,
which is a task that can be completed on a range of levels. While
Internet-only devices may be sufficient to access and a web-based
video editing system, those systems provide far less video editing
capacity than a full video editing application. (These limits include
the length of the video that can be produced, the options for editing
it, and the resolution of the final product.) Especially as students
gain experience and seek to create longer and more complicated
video products, the browser-based products will be insufficient.
Teachers must decide when their students and their goals
have extended beyond the simple tools and full applications are
necessary. This negotiation is informed by the nature of the students,
the goals of the video project, and the availability of the full devices
(which might be shared among many teachers).
IT managers must recognize that the information tasks
teachers anticipate including in their lessons are likely to become
increasingly complex over time. As teachers’ and students’ skill
increases, they will expect to include greater capacity more
frequently. A solution that provides low levels of complexity, but
that can be accomplished with minimal capacity may prove
insufficient as skill increases. Efficacious IT managers will respond
to changing levels of expertise in teachers and they will also attempt
to be proactive by anticipating need and encouraging teachers to
participate in IT planning.

Educational Usefulness versus Device Management
In the previous sections, an oversimplified version of
technology decision-making has been presented. Cost (a very
important consideration for reasonable decisions) and computing
capacity (also important in consideration for ensuring sufficient
88

Efficacious Educational Technology

computing is available) have been identified as the factors relevant
to purchase decisions. While cost and capacity may be the dominant
factors when deciding how to provide sufficient access, other
characteristics of the devices will have implications for which
devices are purchased and how they are deployed.
Boot speed, which determines then length of time it takes
for a user to power a device on and have it ready for use, is an
important factor in many educational situations. A slow boot speed
can lead to students being distracted from the learning task or
frustrated that he or she is falling behind others. A device with a full
operating system is likely to have the slowest boot speed; especially
older models of desktops and laptop computers that store the
operating system on a mechanical hard drive which is slower to start
than one that stores the operating system on a solid state hard drive.
In most schools, devices that run a full operating system also
connect to a server to authenticate users and to load permissions and
other services. All of these factors can extend boot time to the point
where it impedes some educational uses of the devices.
Further delaying boot time in some configurations of full
operating systems is the need to install updates. If computers have
been unused for an extended time (for example during a school
break), then the first users may find the devices will not function
until updates are installed. In some cases, a computer can be
unusable for tens of minutes while updates are installed. To
minimize the disruptions due to slow boot time, IT managers can
purchase devices with solid state hard drives or they can purchase
devices with mobile or Internet-only operating systems.
For several decades, enterprise networking has provided
centralized control of user accounts. In the typical enterprise
network configuration, users authenticate against a single directory,
and the user is assigned to groups depending on his or her role in the
organization. Access to network resources (such as file storage,
printers, and applications installed on servers are all controlled by
rules managed by the network operating system that manages those
permissions on the device with full operating systems. Many of
those permissions were set to control access to devices and to
prevent unauthorized access to network resources. The arrival of
mobile devices and Internet-only devices challenges the methods of
network management and security that are well-established; these
new devices cause IT system administrators to change their
practices.
89

Efficacious Educational Technology

As teachers develop greater technological pedagogical
knowledge (TPK) of the devices they have available, it is reasonable
to expect they will discover and refine more sophisticated uses of
the devices they use and that they will seek capacity beyond that
provided by existing technology. For these reasons, efficacious IT
managers avoid single-device fleets. Although these can provide
easier management and consistent capacity, they can result in
schools maintaining unused capacity and can limit access to devices
or to devices with sufficient capacity. The pedagogical implications
of sections may be unpredictable to IT professionals and the
management implications may be unpredictable to educators.

CHAPTER 4: IT NETWORKS

Especially as Internet-only devices have gained in popularity,
a robust and reliable IT network has become essential
infrastructure in schools. These networks connect students and
teachers to data, information, and interaction within the local
community and across the Internet. Whereas educators once
deferred to IT professionals in the design and deployment of
IT networks, they can no longer avoid knowledge of and input
into how these systems, which are vital to teaching and
learning, function.

Computers were originally designed to accept input
(especially mathematical information), manipulate it according to
rules programmed into the device, then create output (typically on
paper, video monitors, or magnetic tapes). Once the capacity for
computers to send output to other computers emerged, the first
networks were created. As the number of computer systems
increased (and the amount of digital data increased), there was
increased value in connecting them so that information could be
shared between them and users could operate the machines from
remote locations.
Despite being used by academic researchers and the
military for decades, networked computers did not become widely
used in the consumer and education markets until the mid-1990’s
when hypertext transfer protocol (the origin of the http:// that begins
web addresses) was added to the Internet protocols. The World

Efficacious Educational Technology

Wide Web (built using hypertext markup language or html) was
developed which opened the Internet to vast numbers of users, and
both the hardware and software for connecting desktop and laptop
computers to the Internet became a standard part of almost every
computer system.
Since the turn of the century, computing and networking
have become almost synonymous. Many devices are of limited
usefulness without a connection to a network, personal data and files
are stored on web servers, and applications are increasingly
accessed via web browsers. For the first generation of school IT
managers, much attention was placed on obtaining computers for
students to use, and only after they had large fleets of devices did
they turn attention to developing robust local area networks for
instructional purposes. Increasingly, local area network (LAN)
resources are being replaced with services provided via web
browsers (which are described in “Chapter 5: Web Services”), and
access to those depends on reliable and robust networks. All of these
changes, and the deep dependence on networks for teachers and
students to access educational materials, make an information
technology network an essential part of school infrastructure.

Logistic Goal
Efficacious IT managers will articulate a logistic goal such
as “The school will create and maintain a robust and reliable
network (including a wireless network) for students, faculty, and
staff to access the LAN and Internet.”

Context for the Logistic Goal
The adjectives “robust” and “reliable” are used to describe
IT networks. Robust describes the capacity of the network to
provide a connection that delivers the network information that each
requested in a timely manner. A robust network will allow many
users in a classroom to connect with little delay, and there will be
little latency observed in the network traffic. (Latency is the term
used by IT professionals to describe slow connections which cause
performance of web services to suffer.) Reliability refers to the
amount of time the network is available, accepting new connections,
and sending and receiving authorized data packets. In general, a
network that is not robust will fail when a large number of users
92

Efficacious Educational Technology

connect, while one that is unreliable will fail intermittently
regardless of how many users are connected.
For most computer users in schools, “the network is down”
(because it is not reliable or not robust) is an unacceptable situation,
so IT professionals seek to improve the capacity of the network to
provide and maintain connections and manage network traffic.
While IT professionals understand the work of building and
managing reliable networks, collaborative IT management depends
on educators who understand the nature of the network as well as
school leaders who understand enterprise networks so they do not
place unreasonable demands on the IT professionals. The intended
audience of this chapter is the school leaders and teachers who are
involved with efficacious IT management, but who are unfamiliar
with the many aspects of enterprise networks. The purpose of this
chapter is to provide an overview of the hardware, software, and
practices of managing networks; all of these can be upgraded to
improve the performance of school networks. For IT professionals,
this chapter represents the information they should expect the
educators who are involved in IT management to understand. It is
upon this level understanding that educators can begin to grasp the
nature and challenges of IT management.

Networking Starts Here
Opening the door and peering into the wiring closet where
network devices are installed can be an intimidating experience.
These rooms tend to be filled with white noise (generated by fans
moving air which is cooled by air conditioners that operate day and
night during all seasons) and racks of switches with large tangles of
cables connected to ports with blinking green (or at least you hope
green) lights indicating healthy connections. Other devices found in
those rooms have far fewer ports and cables, but they are the most
important devices as one (the unified threat management appliance)
protects the network and its data from malware (viruses) and other
threats (including hackers who attempt to hijack your data for
ransom or use your network to their own purposes) and another (the
gateway) connects all of the devices on your network to the Internet.
It is possible to “break” the network by disconnecting the
wrong cable or turning off the wrong device in the wiring closet. To
keep the network safe, the prudent IT professional will secure the

93

Efficacious Educational Technology

closest and the devices it contains, but the prudent school
administrator will understand how to gain access if necessary.
Who has access to the IT network can be a contentious topic
in school IT management. IT professionals know how to configure
it and they (very reasonably) want to minimize unskilled and
unauthorized individuals from accessing it. School leaders can
generally be considered unskilled in regard to IT network
administration, so it is reasonable to limit their ability to access
certain features of the network configuration. At the same time,
school administrators are the individuals who are ultimately
responsible for what happens in schools and who might need to take
steps to prevent previously authorized individuals from accessing
the network. In most situations, IT professionals and school
administrators are professional and ethical (even when they
disagree), but IT networks (and the data contained on them) are too
valuable to be controlled by too few individuals.
As computers and networks have become vital for school
management and teaching and learning, it is no longer appropriate
for school leaders and teachers to avoid understanding the many
services that keep the IT networks in their schools functioning for
students and teachers. Everyone involved with IT management in
schools must be able to differentiate local area networks from the
Internet (to understand the total costs, management options and
limitations, technology support); and also differentiate consumer,
business, and enterprise networks (and the complexities of the
management tasks that arise from large scale networks).

Local Area Networks
Local area networks (LAN) entered most educators’
experience in the mid-1990’s when the first servers to be regularly
accessed by teachers and students arrived in schools. Early uses of
LAN’s in schools included connecting multiple computers to a
shared a printer and sharing files using a folder (or directory) on a
server which multiple users could access. As educators began to
understand the advantages of networks, the LAN’s in buildings
became connected in more sophisticated ways. In many school
districts, different campuses were connected to a single LAN so
teaching resources developed in one school could be used in
another, computers in different buildings could be accessed from a
single location, and business operations could be consistently and
efficiently managed from all sites.
94

Efficacious Educational Technology

In textbooks that introduce computer networks, readers
often find descriptions of metropolitan area networks which are
networks that extend across cities. Few network administrators use
that term, and school IT managers are likely to hear IT professionals
refer to the LAN which connects users access across many
campuses. In rural areas, LAN’s can connect schools separated by
many miles.
As Internet technologies matured and became more
sophisticated, they have been used for many purposes that were once
fulfilled with servers located on local area, but LAN’s continue to
be an essential aspect of school infrastructure. The easiest way to
differentiate the LAN from the Internet is to answer the question
“Who has physical access to and control over the devices?” Those
that an individual can physically touch in a school building are part
of its LAN, otherwise it is likely an Internet resources. Of course,
actually touching a server requires access to the locked wiring closet
where they are secured; select IT professionals and school leaders
should be the few who have keys to those doors. Network users also
access many LAN and Internet services via web browsers another
application, so the experience of using network resources often is
the same for LAN and internet resources for the user.
As the boundaries between the Internet and LAN services
have blurred, it has become more difficult to predict which services
are provided by LAN resources and which are provided by Internet
resources. Consider the example of library card catalogs. The long
drawers filled with index cards documenting a library’s collection
were replaced with databases decades ago. (I used the drawers until
I earned my undergraduate degree in 1988. When I returned to the
same library two years later when enrolled in a graduate course at
the university, the cabinets had all been replaced with computer
terminals.) Because the databases containing library catalogs are
large and they are accessed frequently, the first digital card catalogs
tended to be installed on LAN servers. Requests to view records
were sent through circuits to a server located quite close to the client
computer from which a library patron requested the record.
Technicians and LAN administrators configured and managed the
hardware and software that made the card catalog available to
library patrons by going to the library and unlocking the closet
where the computers were running.
As we will see in the next chapter, card catalogs are now
web-based services and schools pay a fee to store their card catalogs
95

Efficacious Educational Technology

on the Internet. Librarians continue to maintain the database storing
their collection, but the computers on which the information is
stored are maintained by technicians at other sites (sometimes sites
far removed from the school). This change has been possible, inpart, because the network connections between the library and
Internet are sufficiently robust and reliable that patrons get library
information as quickly over the Internet as they did over the LAN
previously.

Fundamental Concepts of Networking
Fundamentally, computer networks are simple systems. To
build a network, one provides a pathway to move data from one
node to another (through electrical signals transmitted over wires or
radio signals that travel through the air), gives every node a unique
address (so the network “knows” where to deliver packets), and then
keeps track of it all (so the network “knows” where to direct each
packet of information so it arrives at the correct address).
A consumer network can be set up for less than $100 and
has sufficient capacity to provide robust and reliable connections for
(perhaps) 10 devices using it at any moment. To create a consumer
network environment, one visits an electronics store or office supply
store (or web site) and purchases a device that functions as the
gateway between the computers and the Internet and routes traffic
from the small network to the Internet; the same device assigns
addresses to each node, and sends packets to each node within the
small network. The nature of the cable that connects the gateways
to the circuits outside the building depends on the service purchased
from an Internet service provider (ISP); sometimes it is a coaxial
cable, sometimes an Ethernet cable, and rarely a telephone cable.
Typically, one configures the following on a consumer network as
well:
• Wireless access, so that mobile devices can connect to the
network;
• Filtering to prevent access to certain sites or to set other
rules to limit what can be accessed, when it can be accessed,
and on which computers can access the network;
• Firewall to deny unwanted incoming traffic access to the
network.
96

Efficacious Educational Technology

The ease with which one can set up a consumer network can
lead technology-savvy consumers (including teachers and school
leaders who may be involved with IT management in schools) to
misunderstand the task of managing the networks necessary to
provide robust and reliable network connections to the hundreds of
networked computers and devices in schools. Those require IT
professionals to install and manage business or enterprise networks.
Consumer devices are designed to be “plug-and-play” systems, so
many of the essential functions are preconfigured into the devices
as defaults settings and these will work with the defaults settings
that are set on consumer devices. As long as nothing is changed, and
the number of devices is fewer than about 10, a consumer network
will be reliable and robust.
Business class networks are built using network devices
with circuits that provide robust and reliable connections to several
tens of users. In all but the smallest schools, enterprise networks are
necessary to provide sufficient performance. Enterprise networks
are very sophisticated and the devices necessary to provide adequate
performance on an enterprise network are far more expensive than
consumer or business grade devices. Consider, for example,
switches; these devices provide additional ports, so devices can
share a single connection to the network. On a home network, one
might use a switch to allow three desktop computers in a home
office to access the Internet through a single cable. On an enterprise
network, the system administrator might use a managed switch to
connect two new computer rooms full of desktops to the network.
The switch (with five ports) for home would cost less than $50, but
the enterprise switch (with 48 ports) would cost around $5000.
Notice the difference in relative price; consumer ports cost about
$10 per port. Enterprise ports cost more than $100 per port!

Networking Concepts and Processes
Ethernet is the dominant type of network installed in
schools; it uses cables (consisting of eight strands of copper wires
and shielding to prevent electromagnetic fields from interfering with
the signal) that connect to ports in computers, switches, and other
devices with plastic clips that close circuits throughout the network.
Regardless of the size of the network, data rate, addressing, and

97

Efficacious Educational Technology

routing are characteristics that determine how its robustness and
reliability.

Data Rate or Bandwidth
Data rate refers to the amount of information that can be
transferred over a network in a given time; the term bandwidth is
also used to describe data rate. Ever since networks were installed
in schools, IT managers have sought to provide broadband access to
schools, this term refers to connections to circuits providing the
greatest available data rate.
Broadband the term used to describe “large amounts of
bandwidth,” but it is a relative term. In 2015, the Federal
Communication Commission in the United States of America
increased the minimum data rate for connections to be considered
broadband to 25 megabits per second (Mbps). In a commonly-cited
summary of Internet speeds, Akamai (2017) reported the average
connection speed in the United States was 18.7 Mbps. While that is
several times faster than the global average (7.2 Mbps), it is much
slower than those countries with the fastest average broadband
connections. These measurements of data rate are difficult to place
in a meaningful context, but the simple observation “the more
bandwidth the better the performance of the network” is correct. IT
professionals in school enter into contracts with a local Internet
service provider (perhaps a telephone company, perhaps a cable
television provider) to access a connection to the Internet with a
specified bandwidth. The bandwidth provided by the ISP depends
on the nature of their circuits and the price the school budgets to pay
for the service.
The bandwidth available to users in at a location is limited
by the bandwidth of the connection to outside circuits, and
bandwidth is a zero-sum quantity. A system administrator might
complain, “when those students start streaming music, they are
using up all of our bandwidth.” The students are using the finite
capacity of the network to transfer information to listen to music,
thus it is unavailable for other uses.
All network devices (including the network adapters
installed in computers) have a data rating, which reflects that
maximum amount of information that can pass through device per
unit of time. The first Ethernet networks installed in schools
typically used 10Base-T devices which had a maximum data rate of
10 Mbps (megabits per second). It is difficult to understand exactly
98

Efficacious Educational Technology

what that means, but it is important to know those devices were
replaced with 100Base-T devices around the turn of the century, and
those have largely been replaced with devices rated at 1 Gbps
(gigabits per second), and many IT professionals have “future
proofed” their networks by upgrading LAN devices to data ratings
of 10 Gbps. These new network devices can move data 1000 times
more data in a given time than the networks first installed in schools.
While an IT manager who has installed 10 Gbps devices can rest
assured that the network is likely to be robust and reliable, they
know they will replace these devices with devices with greater
capacity in the coming years.
The total data rate of a network connection is determined by
the device in the network that has the least data rate. Consider a
school in which all of the devices were upgraded to provide 1 Gbps
data rate, except for the switch that serves the computers in one wing
of the school where a 100 Mbps switch remained. In that wing, the
greatest possible data rate would be 100 Mbps. Further, if one of the
teachers in that wing is using an older computer in which the
network interface card (which connects a computer to the network)
was rated at 10 Mbps, then that teacher’s maximum data rate would
be limited by that card. For users in the wing connected through the
100 Mbps switch, an especially that teacher connecting through a 10
Mbps network interface card, the more reliable and robust 1 Gbps
network would not be enjoyed.
Factors other than the data rate rating of devices contribute
to the actual performance of the devices as well. Many network
devices (such as switches) include a small computer and software
that helps with sending packets of information to the correct address
and other functions. Just like all computers, if those are asked to
perform too many functions, they stop working; those frozen
processors can reduce data rate to almost zero. The effects of an
overloaded gateway can be particularly troublesome as all network
traffic flows through it to the Internet. I was once asked to help
troubleshoot a network with curious symptoms. Early in the day and
late in the day, the network performed adequately for the few adults
who were in the building and using the network. Once students
arrived and began sending and receiving traffic over the network, it
slowed to a crawl and the data rate was about 1% of what was
provided by the ISP. The technology coordinator was convinced the
problem was due to increased traffic due to computer that was
infected with malware, but there was no evidence of a specific
99

Efficacious Educational Technology

computer generating excessive traffic when the symptoms were
demonstrated and LAN traffic was unaffected. As it turned out, the
network had been configured so that a single switch was responsible
for managing much of the network traffic; the result was the switch
was unable to handle the traffic and, despite it being rated a 1 Gbps,
its effective data rate was a small fraction of maximum. Once
network management was shared among several devices,
performance returned to normal.
If the maximum bandwidth available from the local ISP is
inadequate for the demands of a schools, then the IT professionals
must purchase additional lines and divide the network traffic
between them; this arrangement provides more robust and reliable
availability during those times when network demand is greatest as
there is extra bandwidth to handle to extra demands. In recent years,
many schools have converted to voice over Internet protocol (VOIP)
telephone services. Because of the importance for robust and
reliable telephone service to schools, IT professionals will work
with the vendors who provide the system to ensure it is served by
adequate bandwidth (most often with a connection to the Internet
that is separate from the data network). Changes such as these
typically require expertise beyond that of the LAN administrator
employed by the school, so they hire network engineers to ensure
the reconfigured network provides necessary operation during the
switch over.
The data rate needed by an organization is heavily affected
by the nature of the data being transferred. A text document contains
relatively little information, so sending a word processing document
over a network consumes little bandwidth; video, on the other hand,
contains great amounts of information, thus consumes much
bandwidth to transfer. The network demands of a classroom full of
students reading Wikipedia pages will be far less than a classroom
full of students watching YouTube videos. This explains why many
technology coordinators and network administrators will limit
access to “broadband hogs” like YouTube by decreasing the
bandwidth available to and from the site. They can configure routing
and switching to minimize the bandwidth that is available to
transmit packets from those sites.
Measuring data rate or connection speed is a very easy task,
and it is one of the first steps in troubleshooting a network that is not
performing as expected. There are a number of web sites that can be
used to perform a speed test for a connection. This is accomplished
100

Efficacious Educational Technology

by the sending files of known size to and from your computer. Time
stamps on the packets are used to determine the actual bandwidth of
the connection from the user to the site.
Another step in troubleshooting unreliable, and non-robust
networks is for an IT system administrator to use packet analyzing
software to observe the network traffic in detail. In the vernacular,
this is called “network sniffing.” Using this software provides one
with many details of which nodes are using bandwidth and for which
purposes. Computers found to be generating excessive or
questionable traffic by analyzing the packets originating from it and
passing to it can help IT administrators identify malfunctioning or
malware-infected computers. Consider, for example, some Internet
games transmit traffic using a specific hypertext transfer protocol
port. System administrators can configure the network to not use
those ports, thus preventing access to the Internet gaming site from
the school network.

Addressing
Each device on a computer network must have a unique
address. This is unsurprising as networks operate when information
is sent from one node to another, and without a unique address, it
would be impossible for packets of information to make it to the
correct location. There are two types of addresses (one that never
changes and one that varies each time a computer connects to a
network), and understanding networking requires knowledge of
each.
Every hardware device that connects to a network has a
media access control (MAC) address, which is sometimes called the
physical address of the device, which is programmed into the
hardware when it is manufactured. This address never changes, and
it is useful for identifying with precision a computer or device on a
network; networks sniffers, of example, will be able to identify the
MAC address for every device sending or receiving packets.
Software on a single network device (perhaps a server or
router or gateway or unified threat management appliance) has
dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) operating, and it
assigns Internet protocol (IP) addresses to devices attached to the
network. The IP address is a temporary address; each time a device
connects to a new network it is given an IP address for that session.
On its next connection to the network, the device may be assigned
the same address or it may be assigned a different one. The DHCP
101

Efficacious Educational Technology

server is configured to have a pool of addresses that can be assigned,
when the pool is exhausted, no more devices can be connected.
Into the second decade of the 21st century, Internet
addresses were assigned following the rules known as IPv4 (Internet
protocol version four), so every Internet node was assigned a quaddot address which consists of four numbers separated by dots, for
example 192.168.1.100. Each IPv4 address consisted of 32 bits, so
the Internet consisted of up to 232 (almost 4.3 billion) nodes.
Because that number of address was going to be exhausted (which
would have stopped the growth of the Internet), computer systems
have been configured to use IPv6 (Internet protocol version six),
which uses 128 bits to identify an IP address. This expands the
number of possible Internet nodes to 2128 (3.4 x 1038); an example of
an IP address written in IVv6:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Almost every network is configured to allow information to be
addressed to nodes using either version of the protocol, and IPv4 is
still used to configure LAN’s.
Internet protocol addresses in either IPv4 or IPv6 are strings
of digits, or digits and letters, so they are difficult for humans to
remember. So that World Wide Web sites can be accessed via names
that are meaningful to humans, domains name servers (DNS) are
connected to networks and these convert the universal resource
locator (URL) such as http://www.google.com of a web site into its
IP address. Occasionally a computer will malfunction in a curious
manner; it will appear as if it is connected and some network
operations will continue to function, but users cannot open web sites
unless one knows the IP. In this case, the technician is likely to say,
“It is not resolving addresses,” and he or she will track down and
resolve DNS problems on the machine.
Gateways which are the devices through which all of the
computers on a school LAN connect to the Internet have at least two
network adapters. The external adapter is assigned the gateway’s IP
address on the Internet which is set by the ISP. All traffic requested
from the Internet by a computer on the LAN will be sent to that
external IP address. The traffic then passes to the circuits that
comprise the LAN and the internal adapter of the gateway is set with
a static IP address. Software on the gateway differentiates packets
of information requested by a LAN IP from those incoming packets
that originated from elsewhere and have not been requested. IT
102

Efficacious Educational Technology

security professionals spend much time ensuring incoming data that
is not authorized is not allowed to pass into the LAN.
Each network has 255 addresses (in reality, subnets are used
to increase the number of addresses, but let’s keep it simple in this
example). Following the model of an IPv4 quad dot address, one can
assign 192.168.0.1 through 192.168.0.255 (the first three sets of
digits are always the same on a subnet). These 255 addresses
comprise the pool of addresses that can are assigned and managed
by the single DHCP server on the network. A system administrator
uses up to three options when configuring the DHCP server; two are
used on almost every school network, and the third is used less
frequently.
First, devices that are always connected to the LAN and
always powered on (such as switches, wireless access points, threat
management appliances, and printers) are given static IP addresses.
This type of IP address is configured in the network settings on the
device, and then it is removed from the pool of addresses assigned
by the DHCP server. Often, the LAN administrator removes a series
of IP addresses from those that can be assigned dynamically, then
assigns those to devices necessitating static IP addresses. Devices
are assigned static IP addresses when they are likely to receive
frequent connections from throughout the network, so both humans
and computers benefit from increased performance by always using
the same address. In effect, a static IP address establishes a
permanent IP address so the IP address and MAC address are both
unchanging (until the IP address is changed on the devices by an IT
administrator).
Second, devices that are connected intermittently (including
desktop and laptop computers, Internet-only notebooks, and mobile
devices) are assigned a new address each time it connects by the
DHCP server; this is called a dynamic IP address as it frequently
changes. The system administrator will typically specify the IP
addresses that can be assigned, and once that pool is exhausted, no
mode device can connect to the network until the system
administrator configures another subnet on the LAN.
A third option, which is less commonly used is to have the
DHCP server assign an IP address that is reserved for the device
each time it is connected to the network; of course, this method is
not really dynamic, but it differs from a static IP address as it is
assigned by the DHCP server, and not configured on the device
itself. Reserved IP addresses are removed from the pool of
103

Efficacious Educational Technology

dynamically assigned addresses as well. This method is most often
used when configuring a static IP addresses requires unfamiliar
steps. Some technical schools, for example, connect simulated
electrical panels and other industrial interfaces to their networks for
training purposes. The computers on the panels cannot be accessed
using a familiar graphic user interface, so configuring the static IP
address is done by the server rather than configured into the device.

Figure 4.1 Three options for assigning IP addresses

Routing
For networks to function, packets of information must make
it to the correct destination. This depends on accurate addressing
and also on effective routing. As the name suggests, a routing is the
network function in which packets are sent via a route to their
destination. Routing occurs between the LAN and the Internet and
this is accomplished through a device called a router (or more likely
this function is assigned to routing software on a network appliance
that serves multiple roles).
Within the LAN, information packets are routed by devices
called switches. The unmanaged consumer switch that one can
purchase at the office supply store for $50; it works with the default
configuration (which cannot be changed) for the small number of
devices it connects. The switches on enterprise networks are have
sophisticated software that allows them to manage packets sent to
and from many more nodes and rules for how packets are sent and
received can be configured. This software is one of the reasons
enterprise switches cost about ten times the cost of consumer
switches per port.

Wireless Networks
The term “wireless” can be applied to two types of IT
networks that are commonly accessed by students and teachers.
Individuals who carry smartphones and some tablet computers into
school buildings connect those devices to the network of cellular
phone towers. Those connections depend on the owner having an
active account with a provider and the network signal extending
throughout the school. Those devices are connected directly to the
Internet, and traffic sent to and from those devices does not pass
through the school’s devices and LAN resources are (generally)
unavailable from those networks. These wireless networks are
beyond the control of school IT managers.
“Wireless” also describes wireless Ethernet (commonly
called wifi) which is the technology used to connect mobile devices
(and desktop devices to the LAN with wireless adapters) to the
Ethernet network in schools through radio signal rather than
Ethernet cables. The phones and tablets students and teachers
connect to the cell phone network can also be connected to the wifi
in a school. When using those connections (which is typically
preferred), the traffic does pass through networks owned by the
school. Installing a wifi network requires devices called access
points be installed and configured.
Usually access points are connected to the Ethernet network
via a cable and given a static IP address, then attached to the ceiling
where their health is indicated by LED lights. Inside each access
point, there is an antenna that transmits and receives radio waves.
To connect to the wireless signal, a computer or mobile device must
have a wireless adapter installed and configured; this provides an
antenna similar to that installed in the access point.
Access points are configured to broadcast a service set
identifier (SSID). Typically, these are given names that are
descriptive and a security code is assigned to the SSID. Modern
operating systems will notify users that SSID’s (or “wireless
networks”) are available, and the user can select the SSID to which
she or he wants to connect. If necessary, the user will be prompted
to provide the security code, and those settings can be saved so the
device connects automatically when the SSID is available. System
administrators can set SSID’s so they do not broadcast to users. If a
system administrator wants to create an SSID that only technicians

105

Efficacious Educational Technology

use, then it can be hidden and only technicians know the name of
the SSID and the security code used to connect it.
An access point can be configured to offer SSID’s to
devices within its range (typically a few tens of meters depending
on building materials and power rating), and the SSID’s can provide
different capacity. A common configuration is to make three SSID’s
available on a school network. An “administration” SSID is hidden
from users, and is used to connect the devices of system
administrators, school administrators, and others who need the most
secure connections. A second “teaching and learning” network is
used to connect mobile devices owned by the school most of the
bandwidth is dedicated to this SSID, and it allows users to
authenticate using the servers, and LAN devices (printers, etc.) are
all available when connected to this SSID. A third SSID is available
for “guests” to connect their own personal mobile devices.
Typically, this SSID has limited bandwidth and is does not provide
access to LAN resources.
Two coincident factors motivated school IT professional to
transition from installing wired Ethernet networks in schools to
installing wireless Ethernet networks in schools. First, mobile
devices became increasingly used; smartphones, tablet, and
Internet-only notebooks are not manufactured with Ethernet ports,
so the only option is to connect these through an SSID. Second,
advances in the design of wireless devices provided sufficient
bandwidth that wireless connections performed as well as wired
connections, but the installation costs are a fraction of installing
wired networks. The result is that plans for new networks are likely
to call for sufficient access points to cover the entire footprint of the
school with strong wireless Ethernet signals, and these provide
sufficient data rate to provide robust connections.
One of the challenges in establishing a wifi network in a
school (or any other building) is ensuring each space is served by a
single access point. If there are equally strong singles from two
different access points in a classroom (for example), wireless
adapters on computers in that room will connect to one, then drop
the connection to connect to the other. This process can be repeated
continuously and frequently (drops and reconnects that occur every
minute are not unusual). During each connection cycle, the network
is unusable, so the network will be very unreliable in that classroom.

Network Management
All aspects of enterprise networking require quite specific
expertise. Schools employ network professionals to maintain and
manage the networks installed and they also retain outside network
professionals including engineers and technicians to design and
install network upgrades (both hardware and software) and
extensions (for example adding wireless capacity).

Planning and Installation
An information technology network is much like other
technologies as the expertise needed to design and build it is much
more specialized and expensive to than the expertise needed to
manage and operate it once it exists. Consider how an IT system in
a school is similar to an automobile. Planning and building each
requires engineers and designers who have detailed expertise and
expensive tools, but they are not needed after the automobile exists.
Technicians who keep them operational have lesser (but still
considerable) skill and tools. Users can take some minimal steps to
keep both operational.
When designing new networks or major upgrades, most
technology managers in schools will contract the services of
network engineers. Typically, these professionals work for
companies that also sell, install, and service the devices included in
the engineer’s plans; so, installations and upgrades tend to find
schools entering into extended contractual relationships for service
and repair work on the infrastructure. While these services are very
expensive, after school leaders consider the cost of the devices and
the potential liabilities of insecure networks, they recognize the
value in this expense.
Network installation and upgrade projects are laborintensive and may cause interruptions in network availability and
usually necessitate technicians work throughout the building. To
minimize the disruptions caused to teaching and learning, network
projects can be scheduled during the times when the school is
largely empty of students. The vendors whose engineers plan the
installations and upgrades will also have large numbers of
technicians available, so projects that require many hours of labor
can be accomplished in small lengths of time through many workers.
Engineers design and technicians build IT networks.
System administrators operate and manage the networks once they
107

Efficacious Educational Technology

are installed. Serious problems are brought to the attention of the
engineers who have more complete knowledge of the system to
identify a solution, but most functionality can be sustained by
individuals who have been properly trained and how have adequate
resources.
A key aspect of planning and installing a network is
mapping and documenting the network. IT networks are very
interesting systems. From the inside (when connected to the network
on a computer that has network sniffing software installed and
running), the network addresses of devices can be located with
precision and very quickly, but the physical location cannot be
easily determined. From the outside (when looking at the physical
device), there is no way to know with certainty its network address
or the purpose it serves. A good network map will identify both the
network address and physical location of devices (the devices will
also be labeled with appropriate information). Most network devices
(switches, routers, security appliances, access points, printers, and
most other devices which are given static IP addresses) include a
web server installed on a small computer in the device. By pointing
a web browser to the devices’ IP address, system administrators can
log on to a web page located on the device to monitor its operation,
change its configuration, update its software, and otherwise mange
its operation. This interface can be used to supplement a network
map, but it does not replace network documentation.
Network planning, including mapping, is an important part
of managing IT resources is schools, but it is often not given the
attention that it needs. IT professionals are typically overworked, so
they spend much time addressing technology problems that are very
pressing; the work of documenting the network can be left undone.
While this is seemingly a necessary approach to resolving
technology problems in schools, it can lead to greater difficulties
later. When outside agencies need to access the network (perhaps
because the system administrator is unavailable) or when the school
seeks to document network resources and budget for network
replacement, a network map can save many hours of work that is
billed at a far greater rate than is earned by an IT professional
employed by the school.

Managing Users, Resources, and Data
Once IT infrastructure has been installed, IT professionals
hired by the school adjust the configurations of devices installed by
108

Efficacious Educational Technology

the engineers and technicians so the network is secure, robust and
reliable. They configure settings to authenticate users; give them
access to servers, printers, and other devices; and adjust addressing
and security functions as devices are added to and removed from the
network. Often these are established before the network is installed
(network planning is a vital part of upgrade and replacement
projects and finds school IT professional and network engineers
meeting for many hours to devise and refine the planned
installation).
Accounts are granted permissions according to the users’
role in the school and the resources each is authorized to use. The
accepted network management practice is to provide individuals
who are responsible for managing the school network with two
types of accounts; they log on with standard user accounts when
simply using the network, but then they log on with an administrator
account when they need to change network settings.
In schools, most standard users accounts are assigned to
groups such as “school administrators,” “teachers,” and “students.”
Student groups are further grouped into organizational units such as
“high school students” or “middle school students.” With users
being assigned to well-planned organizations units, network
administrators can quickly and easily deploy changes by applying
them to organizational units.
One commonly used practice for managing user accounts
on the network is to avoid recording users’ passwords. If it becomes
necessary for a network administrator to log on as a specific user or
to restrict a user from the network, then a system administrator can
change the user’s password. The user regains control over the
account by using a one-time only password from the system
administrator, and reset her or his password when first logging on to
the system. This step is taken to preserve the user’s privacy and to
properly account for all the activity using the account. When my
password has been changed by the administrator then I am locked
out of my account and I cannot be held responsible for changes done
under my account. Once I regain control of it, then I am responsible
for it.
In addition to managing user’s access to the LAN through
user accounts, IT administrators can control devices that are
connected to the network by adjusting the network configuration.
For example, they can send operating system updates to desktop
computers, install and update applications, install printers, and set
109

Efficacious Educational Technology

other configurations from one location. Just as user accounts are
placed in organizational units to facilitate management of
individuals’ account who have similar needs, computers can be
assigned to organizational units, so (for example) all of the
computers in a particular computer room can be adjusted by
applying changes to the OU to which the computers belong.
One often-used feature of operating systems connected to
network that is used to manage devices is remote access. When this
is enabled, an individual who knows the IP address (or host name)
of a device can use client software to log on to a computer or server
from a different location on the network. This feature allows, for
example, technicians at one LAN location (perhaps even in a
different building) to take control of a user’s computer to
troubleshoot problems or observe symptoms. In rural schools that
are separated by many miles, but that are connected via a single
LAN, this can be very useful as an IT professional can take control
of a computer without the need to travel to the site. This increases
the efficiency of technicians and minimizes travel expenses.
A well-designed network built with devices of high quality
that are properly configured will typically be reliable and robust
with little input from IT managers. Of course, networks are systems,
so they degrade over time. IT managers in schools spend time and
other resources to slow the rate at which networks degrade. One
important job in keeping systems operational and secure is updating
software, including operating system software, applications, and
drivers (which is the software that allows computers to
communicate with peripherals such as printers). Sometimes these
updates introduce conflicts to the system, so those must be identified
and resolved as well.
Occasionally, and despite the best work of IT professions,
devices fail in sudden and very noticeable ways; this type of sudden
degradation is rarer than the on-going degradation that can make
introduce gradual degradation of performance and ultimately
failure, but they do happen. System administrators will troubleshoot
malfunctioning systems and repair or replace devices that have
failed. A well-documented network map will facilitate the work of
configuring replacement, so IT managers can restore a robust and
reliable network quickly.
Managing the resources and protecting the data on a
network also includes ensuring a disaster recovery plan is
articulated, familiar to multiple technology and school leaders, and
110

Efficacious Educational Technology

properly followed when (not if, but when) a disaster strikes. A
fundamental aspect of disaster recovery is ensuring data and systems
are backed-up to servers that are off-site. Many school IT manager
contract with services that specialize in backing up the information
in organization’s LAN’s on redundant servers.
Managing network resources also includes investigating
proposed changes and upgrades to the system to ensure existing
functions are preserved and that new systems are compatible with
existing systems. Incompatibilities most often become apparent
when operating systems reach the end of life, so they must be
replaced. Small schools and early adopters of particular
technologies are populations that encounter problematic
incompatibilities as well. Small schools tend to purchase student
information systems, accounting software, and similar data
management applications from publishers whose products are less
expensive than others, but that are less likely to be updated. The
effect is that these users are locked-in to less than optimal systems
by the expense of converting records to new systems.

Network Security
Perhaps the most important function of a school IT
administrator is ensuring the network is secure. There are many
potential threats to the IT infrastructure installed in a school and the
data stored on it, thus network security is multidimensional and
necessitates the participation of all members of the IT planning
teams. In general, network security is designed to ensure only those
who are authorized access systems and data (confidentiality), that
the systems and data are accurate and unaltered (integrity), and that
those who need access can get it (availability). These three aspects
of security are somewhat contradictory; confidentiality and integrity
can be ensured by limiting availability, but unfettered availability
poses threats to confidentiality and integrity.
Confidentiality is especially important for school IT
professionals. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) was enacted to ensure sensitive information about
students and families are kept confidential. Much of the data about
students and families that are stored on school-owned or schoolcontrolled IT systems are covered by FERPA protections; school
and technology leaders may be found liable for failing to take
reasonable care in protecting this data.
111

Efficacious Educational Technology

When designing network security measures, IT planners
and managers take steps to prevent threats from damaging the
system or its data. For example, they limit the individuals who have
access to administrator accounts on computers and network devices
to those who are trained and authorized, they deploy unified threat
management devices which scan network traffic for malware, and
they block access to sites know to distribute malware. They also
prevent unauthorized incoming network traffic from gaining access
to the network.
Securing networks can be a particularly challenging
endeavor in those schools where devices owned by students and
teachers, and other guests in the school, are allowed to connect their
own devices to the network. This is necessary in those schools that
have deployed a bring your own device (BYOD) initiative, but there
are other situations in which devices not controlled by the school are
added to the network. Typically, IT managers provide a “guest
SSID” that provides very limited service and others’ devices
connect to that wireless service.
Network operating systems, and software added to networkconnected devices, can monitor and log network traffic and other
unusual events; reviewing the logs generated by this software is a
regular task for IT professionals in schools. If threats are detected,
the IT managers will take steps to remediate damage. This may
include, for example, removing a virus infected computer from the
network, increasing the settings of threat detection, or restoring data
from back-up copies.
It is even possible for IT managers to prevent particular
devices from accessing the network. If a student brings a personal
laptop to school, for example, and it is known to contain viruses and
other threats to the network, then IT managers can use network
sniffer software to identify it, then add it to a “black list” on the
DHCP server, so whenever that device is prevented from obtaining
and IP address, thus switches can neither send no receive data over
the network to that computer. (Take a look again at this final
paragraph. If you are a teacher or a school administrator who
understands what it means, then this chapter has accomplished my
goal for you.)

112

CHAPTER 5: WEB SERVICES

Whereas they once purchased servers that they installed and
maintained servers in the schools where they worked, IT
managers now purchase computing capacity and storage
space on servers owned and operated by others. In this way,
computing is similar to electricity generation. Just as we buy
electricity that is produced at central locations, we purchase
and use computing capacity on servers in a central location.
We use the web to access those resources and our web
browsers allow us to use those resources and create and
manage the information needed for teaching and learning.

The Internet is a collection of computer networks that
extends across the globe and even into space as packets of
information are transmitted across continents and oceans via
satellites. Originally, users of the Internet selected from several
protocols or methods of transferring information (for example file
transfer protocol or simple mail transfer protocol) or using a
computer remotely (for example telnet). The World Wide Web is
built upon hypertext transfer protocol, which was added to the
collection of Internet protocols early in the 1990’s; compared to the
other protocols http is a late addition.
In the decades since its inception, the World Wide Web has
matured in several ways, and improvements have resulted from both
advances in hardware and software of all the computer systems from
client through transmission to server and back to client. The
computers feature more RAM, more and faster processors, and
network adapters with greater bandwidth ratings. The software on
the servers that host files and the web browsers on the clients used

Efficacious Educational Technology

to access files have also become more efficient and capable of
displaying more dynamic and more sophisticated data as well. In
addition, the capacity of the circuits over which information packets
are transmitted has increased; fiber optic cables are becoming
increasingly common and these provide vastly more bandwidth than
the plain old telephone circuits used to move data in earlier decades.
The capacity to move vast amounts of information across
the globe means efficacious IT managers can use the web to perform
many data storage and processing functions that once required local
systems. It also means that educators can use web-based tools for
many teaching and learning activities that once required local
systems. In this chapter I explain the web services that are
improving teaching and learning.

Logistic Goal
Efficacious IT managers will articulate a logistic goal such
as “Web services will support teaching and learning and the systems
will be selected and managed to be easy-to-use and effective.” The
services that are provided depend on local factors including budgets
(some of the web services described in this chapter can be very
expensive), the existing network capacity (web services that cannot
be reached are worthless), and the needs and expectations of the
communities and populations served by the school.

Context for the Goal: The Evolving World Wide Web
At its most basic level, the World Wide Web is a collection
of servers; these computers are always powered on and connected
to the network. Files on a web server are contained in a directory
that is configured to allow outside users to read the contents, and the
file is read when a visitor uses a web browser on his to load the file
at a particular web address. When visiting a web page, a visitor
requests the file be transferred to his or her computer and the web
browser uses the directions in that program to display the file on his
or her computer. While the basic organization of the World Wide
Web has been unchanged since its invention, the languages used to
write web pages have matured in the same way the other software
and hardware that are the foundations for the web matured.

114

Efficacious Educational Technology

The first generation of web pages (sometimes called Web
1.0 by those looking back) were simple files. The programs typically
displayed only text and low-resolution images. The text was
formatted and the location of the images on the pages were
determined by tags added in hypertext markup language.
Hyperlinks, which connected web pages to other web pages, were
also written into the program. Updating a web page included
downloading the html file to a local computer, opening the local
copy in a text editing program to change the contents of the page
including links and formatting tags. The edited files and additional
images were then uploaded to the web server and placed in the
directory that was replicated in the URL for the page. To see the
changes made to edited files, one would open the address, then use
the refresh function in the web browser to reload the program; the
new page is transferred from the server to the local computer and
built in his or her web browser.
Creating content on Web 1.0 was modeled after the print
and electronic broadcasting media models that preceded it. Creating
and disseminating web content required sufficient capital and
expertise to obtain and manage servers and create and format
content, so it tended to be controlled by relatively large and wealthy
organizations and highly skilled individuals. Early advocates for the
World Wide Web in education envisioned an “infinite library” were
students and teachers could find vast information written and
produced and curated by professional writers, artists, and editors.
What has emerged, of course, is something far different.
By the turn of the century, Web 2.0 tools had emerged and
were gaining popularity. These allowed users with more limited
expertise and fewer resources to create content and publish to the
web. Whereas the first generation of creators of content for the web
were largely programmers, the Web 2.0 creators needed only to be
able to use a word processor.
When comparing Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, three differences are
important. First, Web 2.0 allows users or visitors to sites to create
content. Whereas the first web pages contained information created
by the owner, Web 2.0 sites rely on the users of the site to create the
content. This content ranges from simple comments that are added
to pages created by others to entire pages designed by the user.
Creating content on these sites usually requires one have an account
on the site and to comply with the terms of service, but those are
easy to meet.
115

Efficacious Educational Technology

Second, the programs used to create pages on Web 2.0 are
much more complex and the programs utilize information stored in
databases in a way that Web 1.0 did not. These databases both
manage user accounts, so owners of servers can control those who
create content on their sites, and the databases are used to manage
the files and resources needed to create dynamic and media-rich web
sites. For example, with databases a retailer can create a page that
displays different products in different colors depending on search
results or selections made by the visitor. Web pages created with
content stored in databases are often called “mash-ups,” and media
(especially including video and other interactive elements) can be
created on one site and embedded in many pages and sites around
the web.
Third, web pages are created so that mouse clicks and other
input from users can be used to both create content that is stored in
databases and to call programs that are executed on the server or in
the web browser. These aspects of Web 2.0 make the contents and
the functions of Web 2.0 sites much more dynamic than Web 1.0
sites. Using all of the features on Web 2.0 requires one use a web
browser, and that web browser must be updated. Older versions of
web browsers cannot be used to create and view much Web 2.0
content.
There are several different web browsers (including
Microsoft’s Edge which is replacing Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Google Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and others), and these exist in many
versions. The details of how web browsers interact with databases
and display data depends on both the exact version of the web
browser, the version of the operating system installed on the client
computer, as well as which extensions that have been installed on
the client. Screen resolutions, installed fonts, and media players are
all locally managed options that affect web page appearance and
function as well. The result is that web pages are not consistently
displayed across all systems and the viewing experience can be very
different for different users. This is further complicated by the
emergence of mobile computing devices and versions of web
browsers for those devices. To accommodate these many variations,
most web authors are adopting html 5, a programming language that
produces web content that is more consistently displayed on
different systems than previous versions. Web authors are also
constantly and frequently checking their work on multiple systems
as part of their development work.

For many people, the World Wide Web is being replaced by
social media sites as the dominant method of accessing online
information. Social media comprises a large collection of sites in
which the owner of the site provides no content (other than system
announcements and advertisements), and the content is primarily
viewable by those who are connected in some manner to the
individual who posted it. When one visits Facebook, for example,
one sees the content produced by her or his friends or advertisements
that are based on one’s viewing or clicking history. Social media has
become the dominant online experience. Greenhow, Sonnevend and
Agur (2016) observed,
Social media are transforming sectors outside of
education by changing patterns in personal,
commercial, and cultural interaction. These
changes offer a window into the future of
education, with new means of knowledge
production and reception, and new roles for
teachers and learners (p. 1).
Some observers have begun to use the term Web 3.0 to
differentiate the more participatory web that has emerged as the web
matured, but it is unclear how web 3.0 is different from 2.0. What is
clear, however, is that many computer applications and functions
that were once performed by applications installed on the hard drive
of a computer that was sitting on a desk or on a lap are now available
as web services. IT professionals choose the best service model to
provide these web services; and those decisions are determined by
the purpose, the level of expertise they have, and the need to scale
the services. For simple file storage, they can choose an
infrastructure as service (IaaS) model. If they need to design online
applications (that create and use databases, for example), they
choose a platform as service (PaaS) model. They can also use
software as service (SaaS) which finds them accessing software
created on others’ platforms. Of course, single services can provide
multiple models. G Suite, for example, provide a productivity suite
(SaaS model), but also unlimited storage (IaaS model) for
educational users.
When using a web service, one points a web browser to a
site, logs on, and then has applications running in his or her browser.
Web services have replaced productivity applications, media
117

Efficacious Educational Technology

creation tools, and data management tools that were once installed
on computer hard drives. While web-based productivity tools tend
to have fewer features than the applications install on a computer
with a full operating system, they do provide sufficient services for
many purposes and the information one creates using a web service
can be used to create dynamic web pages for other purposes.
School IT managers provide and maintain multiple web
platforms including those for:
• Internal clients to use for teaching and learning (including
cloud-based productivity suites and virtual learning
environments);
• Internal clients to use for business and information
management (including student information systems and
document management);
• External audiences to use for interactivity (especially email;
but also chat, video chat, and messaging);
• Disseminating information to external audiences (including
web sites and social media).
Web services include both those created specifically for
educational purposes and audiences (such as student information
systems) and also those intended for general audiences (for example
social media which I include as web services) that have adapted for
educational purposes. Because school IT managers are providing
web services for potentially sensitive audiences (children) and that
contain potentially sensitive information (about students and other
people), they take precautions to ensure the privacy and security of
their users and the data for which they are responsible.

Managing Accounts
The information one is able to see, the content one is able
to create, and the interactions one is allowed when using any web
service depends on the permissions that are assigned to the user.
When a web service is first configured, super administrator accounts
are created, and individuals who log on with those credentials exert
complete control over how the services are to be configured for all
118

Efficacious Educational Technology

of the users within the organization and also make some changes
that can affect the operation of the software for all users in the
organization. Typically, the super administrator will create other
administrator accounts to manage the regular operation of the web
service and will use the super administrator account only when
changing the configuration of the services.
Many school IT managers find it necessary to support web
services from multiple publishers (for example different vendors are
likely to provide email, productivity suites, learning management
system, student information system, electronic portfolio system,
library catalog, and full-text databases for library patrons). Logging
on to each system can require a different set of credentials, and users
who follow the recommended security practice of having different
passwords for each site, are likely to find they forget passwords, so
it is necessary to reset passwords frequently.
To minimize the barrier presented by multiple credentials,
IT managers can select web services that allow for single-sign on
(SSO). A common SSO strategy is to use Google’s application
program interface (API) to connect web-services to the G Suite
domain managed by the school. This allows keys to be shared
between web services, so that the credentials on G Suite are used to
log on to other systems. In addition to minimizing the number of
credentials that users must remember, this scheme provides for
centralized management of credentials as changes made to the G
Suite profile are reflected in all connected SSO systems.
Regardless of the methods used to manage accounts on
different web services, one challenge facing school IT managers is
that significant parts of their populations are under 13 years of age.
Laws in the United States prevent organizations that provide web
services from keeping personal information about young users
without explicit permission from the youngster’s parent or guardian.
For this reason, school IT managers take extraordinary care in
vetting the web services that will be used by students and they take
extraordinary care in configuring account settings to minimize
potential threats to students’ information.

Systems for Internal Clients use for Teaching and Learning
Internal clients are those users who belong to the
organization and who are subject to the policies and procedures of
the organization. In schools, this includes teachers, staff, and
119

Efficacious Educational Technology

students, but also in some situations parents and outside consultants
who have the need to access information about the students. School
IT managers do provide and support web services that facilitate
efficient instruction as well as those that provide for interaction and
collaboration for internal clients.

Web Services for Instruction
It has been established that some concepts and skills can be
broken down into steps and procedures that are clearly and explicitly
presented and practiced, and performance can be clearly measured.
Because of these characteristics, they can easily be translated into
computer programs. Further, the databases used to store Web 2.0
data can be used to record a wide range of information about
students’ progress through instructional materials that are on the
web.
Designing effective instructional materials can be very
expensive as it is time-intensive and requires content expertise,
design expertise, and programming expertise; but deploying digital
instructional materials is done via the web at minimal marginal cost.
Once the materials exist, the cost of having additional users access
it are small; IT professionals would say, “they scale well.” For these
economic reasons, instructional web services used in a school are
often provided by organizations external to the school. In the most
frequently used model, school leaders subscribe to a service that
entitles them to create and manage accounts for students and
teachers. Teachers then select the content that will be available to
their students, and the content is accessed as part of the school day
and also at times outside the school day. A variety of statistics
regarding students’ use of the system and performance are displayed
on a dashboard. In most of these systems; the content, the path and
pacing, and the performance are all controlled by algorithms and
information programmed into the system.
Instructional web services are available for many content
areas, but vendors tend to produce materials for mathematics,
computer programming, test preparation, and similar well-known
and easy-to-measure content areas. Both commercial entities as well
as non-profit organizations create such content. Khan Academy is a
non-profit organization that is well-known for the instructional
materials it has made available and the tools that can be used to track
learners’ performance. While many have considered the role of such
content in both K-12 education as well as higher education, the role
120

Efficacious Educational Technology

of these organizations in a system of accredited educational
institutions has yet to be resolved education (Gebril, 2016; Zengin,
2017). For school IT managers, providing and managing web
services for instructional purposes is largely focused on working
with teachers to vet the systems they identify as meeting their needs,
and that conform to the acceptable technology use policy of the
school. They configure the systems for easy access and monitor
access to ensure it conforms to the terms of service of the producer.
IT professionals then ensure there is sufficient data rate (bandwidth)
and the LAN is configured to provide robust access and that web
browsers are updated to ensure instructional web services are fully
functional.

Cloud Productivity
Productivity suites are collections of computer applications
that are used for creating documents and information; a productivity
suite will include a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation
software, and other applications depending on the tools that have
been developed by the publisher and the version of the suite that is
being used. For most of the history of desktop computing,
Microsoft’s Office (with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint among other
applications) has been the most popular productivity suite and it is
widely used in both schools and businesses. Using Microsoft Office
requires one to purchase a license and install the software on a hard
drive of the computer upon which one intended to use it. Unless the
suite had been installed on the computer that you were using, it was
unavailable to you.
Creating word processing documents, presentations, and
spreadsheets has been a fundamental purpose of using computers for
generations of students and teachers, and these types of files
continue to be one of the functions essential to computer users in
schools. While Microsoft Office continues to be very widely used,
productivity suites that are available as web services and that find
users creating word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and other
documents in a web browser are gaining a large share of the
educational users. Google’s G Suite, formally called Google
Application for Education (GAFE), is the most dominant cloudcomputing platform; Microsoft’s OneDrive and Zoho are other
examples, but G Suite is by far the most dominant in the educational
market. (Questions about the degree to which Google has monetized
public schools and the data about interactions in school are
121

Efficacious Educational Technology

recognized, but have been excluded from consideration here.) All
cloud productivity suites operate under similar models. Once they
log on, users will see the tools for creating and managing files, files
they have created earlier, and even files that have been created by
others and have been shared with them in their web browser.
Compared to managing local computing resources, there are
several advantages of providing cloud-based productivity. For the
students and teachers, cloud-based productivity suites make files
and software available on any computer where there is an Internet
connection and an up-to-date web browser. Prior to this web service,
files were stored locally on computer hard drives or other read only
devices (disks of various materials or small circuits of flash memory
that plugged into USB ports). While those media were very portable,
they were also localized, and without access to the media, there was
no access to one’s files; forgetting a USB drive meant spending the
day without access to one’s files. With cloud productivity, files can
be accessed from any device with an Internet connection.
Incompatibility between home computers and school
computers is another problem that has been resolved with cloudbased productivity suites. In the past, it was not unusual for files that
were created on computers at home to be unreadable on computers
at school and for files creates at school to be unreadable at home.
This was the result of different software and versions of software
being installed on the different computers. These problems were
avoidable by using universal file formats such as rich text format for
word processing files, but this step was often forgotten or ignored.
Now that web-based productivity is available to school users, this
problem has largely disappeared, at least for productivity files. Files
can be read and edited with any computer that is connected to the
web and that has an updated web browser installed. This
interoperability is perhaps the most useful advantage of adopting
cloud-based productivity tools in schools.
Because the files created on cloud-based productivity suites
are stored on the web, each file has a unique web address and each
file is associated with the account that was used to created it. Owners
of these files can share them with other users’ accounts. Using this
feature, students can collaborate on files and they can share files
with teachers so they can edit them, comment on them, or simply
view them. For example, a science teacher can share an outline for
a project with students so they can view it, and they can click to
make their own copy and then the members of a group can be given
122

Efficacious Educational Technology

permission to edit the group’s copy of the outline. These files can
also be embedded in other places on the web (used as mash-ups), so
others can view students work as well. The teacher can then
comment on the final version to give feedback.
In addition to advantages of cloud productivity suites for
end users, it provides advantage for IT managers. Security,
upgrades, backups, and other management tasks fall to the providers
of the system. One effect of accepting others’ management
decisions is that the providers of the system can push changes to
users, and those can be implemented without the input or consent of
the users (this is not true of all changes, and most changes are
announced months in the future, but features that teachers use only
occasionally may be changed before teachers can respond).
Consider, for example, a teacher who prepared to teach students to
write research papers using specific tools in Google Apps for
Education. If the managers and engineers of GAFE decided to
deprecate or remove one of those tools when upgrading to G Suite,
then it will be unavailable to the teacher and her students who now
use G Suite; they have no choice but to adapt to the changes made
by Google.
For a variety of economic reasons, many providers of cloud
productivity suites do make them available at little or no cost to
educational populations. As productivity suites do provide
educationally relevant (and important) functionality, and because
proprietary productivity suites can be very expensive, many schools
realize significant cost savings when they adopt cloud productivity.

Virtual Classrooms
Content management systems (CMS) are web content
creation and publishing platforms that incorporate many Web 2.0
tools into a single site; users with accounts on the CMS can add,
edit, and manage information and media on those parts of the site
they have permission to edit. Some content management systems
have been designed specifically for managing content and
interaction for educational purposes, and these are typically referred
to as learning management systems (LMS). Open source LMS
platforms have matured to the point where they are easily and
inexpensively available and can be installed by school IT managers
with modest skills and modest budgets. These tools can be used to
support many aspects of teaching and learning in schools
(Ackerman, in press).
123

Efficacious Educational Technology

By providing and supporting an LMS, IT managers in
schools enable teachers to offer online sections of courses and they
enable blended or hybrid courses in which online activities
supplement face-to-face lessons. With an LMS installed, teachers
can engage students with a wide range of digital tools from one site.
A full service LMS will provide:
• File sharing, so teachers can make templates, word
processing files, PDF copies of articles, presentation files,
and other files available to students who can access the
materials independently;
• Html editors, which support embedded media, so teachers
and other course creators can build content pages that
incorporate both the content they compose and media from
other sources;
• Tests and quizzes that include items (such a multiple-choice
questions) that can be graded by the system and those that
must be graded by the instructor;
• Assignment drop boxes, so students can submit digital files
that are time stamped and grading rubrics, mark-up tools,
and other options for providing students with feedback;
• Gradebooks that display both assignments and tests that are
part of the LMS as well as columns for off-line work;
• Discussion boards, blogs, journals, wikis and chat rooms
that facilitate both asynchronous and synchronous
interaction and collaboration.
While these functions are all available on separate
platforms, IT managers in schools who implement learning
management systems cite several reasons they support the LMS
rather than separate participatory web services as the most
efficacious method of providing these services. First, IT managers
are responsible for supporting the technology that is used for
teaching and learning. If teachers are allowed to select the
participatory sites they use with students, then IT managers must
either learn multiple platforms or they must provide less than
124

Efficacious Educational Technology

adequate support. It is unreasonable to expect technology support
professionals to support many and disparate systems, and it is
unreasonable to expect students to become facile users of different
systems that provide the same functionality. By using a single
collection of digital tools, teachers reduce the cognitive load
(Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011) that students experience if they
must learn to use multiple systems for the same purpose.
Second, using an LMS allows teachers to share grading
rubrics, assignments, and other resources across all of the courses
taught in a school through templates. Consider a school that offers
many sections of a social studies course. Using the capacity to create
a course template in an LMS, IT managers can efficiently deploy all
of the resources needed by students who enroll in a social studies
course. The syllabus, resources, readings, links, assignments, and
other features common to all sections of the course can be deployed
immediately in the template, then teachers can customize their sites
on the LMS for the sections they teach. Further, templates can be
used to create courses to allow for more consistent appearance of
the site and for consistent tools which can decrease the extraneous
cognitive load of using the site and interacting with course materials.
Third, by using the one LMS provided by the school,
teachers have more access to support (in using the site) and in
troubleshooting and custom configurations than they do when using
disparate and separate Web 2.0 tools for teaching and learning. The
convenience extends to students as well as they can access materials
for all course through a single site and the navigation strategies used
in one class will be effective in all other classes.
Fourth, by using an LMS, IT managers and teachers allow
data flow between the school’s student information system and the
LMS. While this frequently requires additional configuration
(including programming help from the providers of the systems
which is similar to the level of support needed when installing
network upgrades), it can allow for automated enrollment
management and transfer of grade information. Administrators of
an LMS also have access to users’ accounts, so they can both
manage and troubleshoot accounts and assess and resolve problems.
A student who forgets his or her password to a participatory web
site may spend many minutes resetting it through email, but the
same process on an LMS managed by the school can be completed
in far less time. Managing user accounts on an LMS can also be
eased by connecting other Web 2.0 accounts to the LMS. For
125

Efficacious Educational Technology

example, using Google applications programing interface (API) and
extensions to the LMS, IT professionals can configure an LMS so
that G Suite accounts are used to log on.
A final reason IT managers prefer teachers use the LMS
they support rather than web sites available to the general population
is that participatory web sites are unlikely to allow sufficient control
over users’ accounts to satisfy local technology policies and
procedures, and the terms of use may violate school policy. Using a
participatory web site requires one accept the publisher’s terms of
service (TOS), and those terms may expose students’ information to
unknown or unforeseen parties. In some cases, teachers use of the
participatory web may actually violate the TOS, especially if they
are directing students to use the “freemium” version of commercial
sites.
Freemium sites allow limited use of sites, generally for
personal purposes, and users of the free version see advertisements
embedded in the pages they use. Those advertisements may include
products inappropriate for students, and requiring students to view
advertisements as part of their school work may violate teachers’
ethics and school policy.
Once IT managers decide to provide an LMS they have
several decisions to make. First, they must decide on the LMS
platform to obtain. There are several options, including those from
proprietary publishers as well as those developed and supported by
open source communities. The functions available are largely the
same on each, and how they function depends on the exact version
that is installed as well as the features that are enabled and the thirdparty extensions that are installed.
Second, IT managers must decide a server on which the
LMS will be installed. Typically, they select to a) purchase space on
a server provided by a company that specializes in hosting the LMS,
b) install the LMS on a LAN server, or c) install the LMS on a web
hosting service. Each choice has advantages and disadvantages
including cost, responsibility for backing-up files and configuring
access, and the flexibility of configurations. In general, IT managers
can purchase complete LMS management functions and server
management, but the cost can be unreasonable for many schools.
Managing an LMS and the server on which it is hosted can become
a full-time job, however, so those costs can become unreasonable.
For IT managers, providing and managing an LMS requires

126

Efficacious Educational Technology

negotiation to ensure it is an efficacious part of the educational
technology in the school.
In many organizations and businesses, employees and
members use portals that resemble an LMS for many purposes.
Employees maintain institutional profiles (which allow them to be
paid) and they access work schedules, and receive both
organizational training and professional training through online
portals. Higher education is increasingly adopting online and hybrid
courses, as well. Because portals and online learning are ubiquitous
outside of school, many K-12 educators believe experience with an
LMS is an essential aspect of middle and high school curriculum to
prepare students for the digital landscape of work and school after
graduation.

Electronic Portfolios
Whereas the effects of instruction are generally understood
to be determined by measuring learners’ ability to answer questions
in a testing situation after the instruction has concluded, the
outcomes of authentic learning (Herrington, Reeves, Oliver, 2014)
are generally understood to be demonstrated in products and
performances. Artifacts of those products and performances (along
with learners’ reflection in the importance and meaning of the
artifacts) are collected in portfolios. A range of web services can be
adopted and adapted for creating electronic portfolios.
As with all web services, IT managers collaborate with
educators to make decisions about the web services to be supported
for students to make electronic portfolios. Among the important
decisions that determine which technologies meet the need are the
nature of the artifacts that will document the work (for example
audio and video files necessitate different capacity than simply
images), the physical and virtual location of the files the be included,
and the intended audience for the portfolios. The nature of the
students is a further consideration; the needs of high school students
preparing their first professional portfolios are far more
sophisticated from the needs of elementary students documenting
their first project-based learning activities.
In some instances, IT managers will recommend using
existing web services as a platform for electronic portfolios; the web
site tool in G Suite is a popular choice. Others choose tools that are
specifically designed for creating and managing electronic
portfolios; Mahara (n.d.) is an example of an open source package
127

Efficacious Educational Technology

that is used to create web-based electronic portfolios. For those
students who are graduating and who are adults, IT managers
sometimes recommend social networking sites as the appropriate
platform for electronic portfolios as students can maintain them
once they leave the school and there are already active networks of
professionals on those sites that students can join.
Regardless of the web service used for electronic portfolios,
they serve several purposes in schools. Eyon, Gambino, and Török
(2014) compared the performance of students enrolled in courses
that included electronic portfolio with students in courses that did
not use that tool. They found evidence that creating an electronic
portfolio was positively associated other indicators of student
success in college including pass rates of courses, grade point
average, and retention rate. They concluded these effects are
grounded in the greater levels of reflection and metacognition that
are necessary for a portfolio-based program than for one without
that experience. Further, they conclude electronic portfolios become
a valuable source of information to educators and school leaders as
they make decisions regarding programmatic and curriculum
changes and improvements.

Web Services for Libraries
As the World Wide Web has matured, many tools have been
adopted by and adapted for library services. As the web has become
the “place” where patrons access digital research and reference
materials, librarians have both embraced digital tools to expand and
extended their reach, so—despite the temptation to rely on Google
for all of our information needs—libraries continue to play an
essential role in schools.
In the 21st century, card catalogues in school libraries first
became digital with web interfaces that pointed to databases stored
on servers connected to the LAN and located in the school. Today,
the databases containing catalog of collections (that can’t really be
called card catalogs since the cards have bene gone for decades)
have been uploaded to the web, and patrons point web browsers to
pages where can browse, search, and check the availability of
collections.
The nature of the periodicals available to library patrons has
changed because of web services as well. School librarians purchase
subscriptions that allow patrons to access full-text databases of
periodicals. The list of titles that are available depends on the
128

Efficacious Educational Technology

subscription purchased by the librarian, and the subscription may
also have some other limits, but in general, library patrons can
access effectively infinite collections of peer-reviewed,
professional, and popular periodicals from any computer in the
world.
Perhaps the most useful tool available to those who use fulltext databases, at least from the researcher’s point of view, is the
automated bibliographic tools. Once a valuable resource has been
identified and read (for those of us over a certain age this reading is
from a paper copy were have printed and that contains our own
hand-written notes), a click of a mouse button can display the full
reference in the researcher’s choice of several popular style guides.
Compiling a reference list requires one to copy (or export) the
citation generated by a web service, paste (or import) it into a word
processor, then check the format is correct. All aspects of library
management and library-based research have been transformed by
web services, so librarians are among the most active collaborators
with IT managers in schools.

Internal Clients: Information and Business
Schools are information-rich places; teaching and learning
necessitates individuals and groups have access to, manipulate, and
create information, but running the organization also necessitates
administrative and human resource information needs be met. While
many of these functions fall outside the focus of this book on
teaching and learning, there are several web services that are
ancillary to teaching and learning, but that have important
implications for teachers.

Student Information Systems
There are a wide range of records kept about students in
schools. The list includes demographics (to confirm residency and
accurate knowledge of legal guardianship), health records,
disciplinary and attendance records, and academic records. These
records must be accurate as they are reported to governmental
agencies and other schools and organizations, and they may be used
as evidence in legal actions. While some student records are still
maintained as paper records, most new student records are
maintained on student information systems (SIS) that are provided
as web service.
129

Efficacious Educational Technology

Compared to traditional paper-only student information
systems, one of the greatest advantages of web-based SIS is the
ability of IT managers to query the data contained in the SIS to
answer questions and generate reports regarding students’
performance or other aspects of students’ experiences at school.
This has resulted in the emergence of the data analyst as a
specialized role within the collection of IT professionals employed
in schools. These individuals manage the data in the SIS and write
programs to create necessary reports, so the information about
schools is more available to leaders and governing bodies than it
was when student records were paper.
A web-based SIS can also make information more available
to parents and guardians than paper records. When fully configured
and deployed, a web-based SIS will allow authorized individuals to
create accounts that are given access to view students’ information,
including grades in individual courses. The online gradebook can be
a technology that leads to controversy in communities. While it can
be a source of information about performance, many teachers see
this as an inappropriate intrusion into the learning community they
create within their classrooms.
In schools where both an SIS and an LMS are used, teachers
and IT managers typically face a decision about which gradebook to
use—either the one in the LMS or the one that is part of the SIS.
While parent or observer accounts can be created in LMS’s to allow
others to see a user’s grade, this capacity usually requires additional
configuration of the LMS beyond the base installation. Student
information systems marketed to K-12 schools have parent or
observer accounts as part of the core installation. In some cases, the
LMS and the SIS can be connected so that grades entered in the
LMS can populate the SIS. A particular concern when configuring
the SIS is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
which protects students’ privacy. When configuring a SIS that is a
web service, school IT managers must take steps to ensure that
systems are protected from internal and external threat that would
expose that data to unauthorized audiences.

Document and Business Management
Schools are social organizations, thus places in which
policies and procedures requires information be shared so that tasks
can be assigned and resources managed in an equitable and efficient
manner. Teachers and others are involved in recommending budget
130

Efficacious Educational Technology

and other decisions, they request purchase be made, and events be
scheduled. All of these depend on web-based services that are
reliably available and that provide the necessary information in an
effective and easy-to-use manner. While these tools fall outside of
the collection of tools that directly affect teaching and learning,
educators who can manage these aspects of their professional work
have more time for their most important work.
Two information management tools for internal audiences
that are not specific to teaching and learning, but that have important
implications for the technology-using experiences of teachers and
their students are the system for scheduling shared resources as well
as the system for requesting technology support. Both of those are
detailed in “Chapter 6: Technology Support Services.”

External Audiences for Interaction
The “I” in IT ostensibly refers to “information,” so IT
professionals have expertise in operating and managing information
technologies. The roots of the Internet as a venue for interaction
among dispersed researchers is well-known. This history, along
with the emerging dominance of social media and other messaging
tools, suggest the “I” in IT could easily refer to interaction, so IT
professional have expertise in operating and managing interaction
technology. While “interaction technology” is a term that few would
find meaningful, IT managers do recognize that the systems they
create and operate are widely used so that faculty, students, and staff
can communicate with others within the school and with individuals
outside the school. These tools are used by those within the school
to initiate contact as well as for outsiders to initiate contact with
school employees.
The first tool for technology-mediated interaction to gain
widespread use among educators was electronic mail (email); and
the number of messages (along with attachments) sent between
accounts is astounding. Most messages that arrive at one’s inbox in
a given day are SPAM (unwanted email). The work of separating
the important messages from the noise of the SPAM has led many
technology-savvy individuals to adopt other methods of interaction
for important messages. Most colleagues know the best way to
contact me in a way that will get a quick response is to send me a
text message, others know to contact me via FaceBook Messenger,
and still others via Twitter or LinkedIn. Despite the decreasing
131

Efficacious Educational Technology

importance of email for professional communication, it is expected
that email will continue to be an essential method of interaction for
both internal and external communication.
An email inbox points to a location on the Internet; and like
all locations on networks, it is unique. Information is sent to this
location, then read (or ignored) by the person who has been given
permission to see the messages (and send similar messages to other
inboxes). Digital records, including those central to web services,
are stored in databases, and a requirement of every database is that
each record contain a unique identifier. Because they are all
different, email addresses serve as unique identifiers in the
databases of users for participatory web sites. Also, email address
can be used to manage identities, so passwords for participatory web
sites can be reset through an email account. For these reasons, email
will continue to be a vital, but less important, method for
technology-mediated interaction within school populations. In
addition, email accounts are likely to be assigned to individual
regardless of the degree to which they are used to send and receive
messages.
Because email has not been completely replaced as a tool
for digital communication, and because many adults choose to
separate their professional and personal communication (in some
cases they seek to separate multiple professional and personal
identities) school IT managers provide email accounts to teachers,
staff, and some students. They also tend to articulate expectations
regarding how responsive teachers will be to messages received via
email. Many parents, vendors, community members, and others
expect educators to have access to email accounts and they expect
to be able to communicate with educators through email. There are
other implications of making email accounts available to members
of their communities that school IT managers must recognize and
plan to address.
First, school IT managers must decide how to make email
accounts available to the public. While it may seem reasonable to
publicize email addresses of faculty and staff who are public
employees, there are software bots that troll the web searching for
that “@” and “.” within a word that characterize email addresses.
Once these bots find email addresses, they become the target of
SPAM and other threats. While this may seem innocuous, the
additional messages can place excessive demand on both IT
infrastructure and on professionals’ time as they seek to manage
132

Efficacious Educational Technology

these messages. Minimizing these demands is particularly important
once one recognizes that SPAM is a significant point of entry for
viruses and other malware into an organization’s LAN.
Second, school populations include those who are under 13
years of age, and their personal information is protected under
Children’s Internet Protection Act and the Children’s Online
Protection Act each identify actions IT manager and school leaders
in the United States must take to protect this information. Regardless
of the laws in any jurisdiction, most school IT managers feel a
professional responsibility to protect all students from threats
through email. At the same time, educators have a responsibility to
give students who are young adults experience using email and
managing interaction. Further, some students may have no access to
an email account outside of school, and this is an important tool for
the transition to post-secondary education or to work.
Third, electronic communications can become evidence in
legal proceedings; as a result, school IT managers are expected to
archive email and other electronic communications. The length of
time such records are maintained depends on the local policy and
procedures, but five years is generally regarded as the length of time
email and other electronic communications are archived. Such
records are kept for the protection of both the sender of messages as
well as the recipient of messages. Some school leaders are taking
steps to ensure those who contact individuals through school email
addresses or other electronic means understand the messages are
archived and may be used in legal proceedings.
While email will continue to be a part of school IT used to
facilitate interaction within internal audience and between internal
and external audiences, the asynchronous nature of these messages
interferes with some communication. Chat and video chat are
methods of synchronous communication in which information is
shared over the web either between individuals or small groups.
These tools complement email, and they have common uses in
education. Chat is widely used in technology support and sales by
vendors. IT technicians who are trying to resolve problems or who
are communicating with manufacturers’ IT support are likely to be
logged on to chat rooms and interacting via typed messages with
company representatives. Video chat is a real-time full video link
between locations. This is a bandwidth-rich form of interaction, so
it tends to be used for very specific activities in which full video is
useful.
133

For many reasons, school IT managers have historically
sought to minimize access to chat and video chat. As a result, it was
common to find those protocols to be blocked on firewalls and
unified threat management appliances protecting school networks in
the past. School IT managers can improve interaction with external
populations and make these tools available to students and teachers
by accommodating requests for chat and video chat in those
circumstances in which it is appropriate. They should also be
prepared to facilitate both the end capacity and the network
resources to use these tools to be robust and reliable in schools.

Disseminating Information
The World Wide Web was originally designed to make it
easy for users to access information. For the first decades of the
history of the World Wide Web, it was only marginally used by
public institutions (including schools) to disseminate information.
As the web has matured, it has become available to much larger
portions of the population and it is accessed through more types of
devices, so there is growing expectation that schools and educators
will have an active web presence. Educators make information
available on the web so that it can be accessed using diverse devices.
As a result, IT managers are supporting educators who disseminate
digital information through a variety of platforms. This information
includes both policy and procedure announcements and other
seemingly mundane (but very important) information such as the
school lunch menu and details of students’ performances.
In addition to being space for members of the community to
learn about their activities, a school web site is often the first place
members of the general public go to find out about a school
community. Many candidates for job openings will visit school web
sites to learn about the school and get a sense of values and beliefs
of the community, and these become to focus of candidates’
questions to interview committees. Real estate agents visit school
web sites to find information for their clients as well. In secondary
schools, guidance departments share details regarding college
selection and application for students and their families on the web.
Mobile devices, especially smartphones, are becoming the
dominant tool for accessing the World Wide Web for many users.
Mobile devices differ from computers and laptops in two important
ways. First, the web browsers installed on mobile devices have less
capacity than the web browsers on computers with full operating
134

Efficacious Educational Technology

systems. Second, the screens on mobile devices are smaller than the
screens on desktop computers and laptops. These can affect the way
information is displayed on these devices. A growing expectation is
that a school web site will be “mobile-friendly,” so school IT
managers are adopting strategies to build, test, and maintain these
sites. In many cases, the CMS used to create the site can be
configured to vary how information is displayed when visitors use
a mobile web browser.
Increasingly, schools are supplementing their web presence
with a social media presence. Social media are the tools on the
participatory web that make it extremely easy to publish
information, and that information is pushed to specific audiences as
well as being available for the general Internet user. Concerns over
bullying, distraction, and other problematic uses led many school IT
managers to block access to social media sites on school networks.
This is proving less effective in minimizing use of social media
during school hours that it was previously as students and teachers
access social media sites by connecting over the mobile wireless
networks and their cell phones, thus by-passing the school network.
Managing an active social media presence does require a
web information be posted to multiple platforms. Of course, there
are differences in the nature of the information posted on the various
social media platforms. By using the embed feature or by creating
widgets, social media masters for schools can ensure media posted
on social media platform are available in other online spaces as well.
Many social media sites allow users’ content to be embedded in html
pages, and those pages are updated as social media content is
created. Some of the social media with educational applications are
described below:
• Facebook- This social media platform that boasts billions of
users. (Of course, it is easy to count numbers of accounts on
Facebook, but is not possible to reliably know how many
people are users of Facebook.) Users of Facebook post
messages (in text, audio, and video) to their space (the name
given to the wall or timeline has changed over Facebook’s
history); posts are available for “friends” to see and friends
may reply or repost or they may tag other users so they see
it. One can even stream live video for friends to view. One’s
profile can be made public or private and groups can be
created so that all members use Facebook to communicate.
135

Efficacious Educational Technology

• Twitter- This microblogging platforms was originally based
around 140-chatercter text posts which were seen by
followers. Twitter posts can now include more characters
and media; hashtags are also used to contribute to wider
discussions and to help curate conversations and posts. Two
popular uses of Twitter in schools are to update followers
on sporting events and to embed Twitter feeds in web pages
so that announcements are both sent to followers and posted
to the web immediately. Both of these are examples of “live
Tweeting” in which information is posted to the social
media to make it immediately available to others.
• Instagram- This social media platform is designed to allow
users to post pictures. It was acquired by Facebook in 2017,
and continues to be widely used.
• Periscope- This is a social media site that is used to live
stream video’ followers can see what the user’s camera is
pointed at in real-time (or with a delay of a few seconds). A
Periscope feed can also be embedded in a web site, so live
streaming can be viewed by any visitors to a web site.
• YouTube- This well-known video site is a social media site
that has been part of Google since 2006. Users can upload
video (that can be public, unlisted, or private), they can
subscribe to others’ channels, and they can post comments
that appear on the page where a video is displayed.
• Pinterest- When using this social media site, users “pin”
stories, sites, images, video, and web sites in order to build
collections of related content. This model emerged from the
original practice of bookmarking which found users saving
the addresses of useful and interesting sites in his or her web
browsers. Pinterest is the latest platform for social
bookmarking which finds users sharing their bookmarks
over the web.
• LinkedIn- This social media site is similar to Facebook, but
it tends to be used for professional purposes. While I post
pictures of my visits to baseball stadiums and similar events
136

Efficacious Educational Technology

on my Facebook page for my tens of friends and family to
see, I post short essays and similar items to my LinkedIn
profile for my much larger network of professional
associates to read.
As the label of the sites makes clear, social media is
designed to facilitate interaction, so comments and reactions from
other users is a part of life on social networks. Users have little
control over the comments others make on their content, and there
is little recourse if comments are uncomplimentary, inflammatory,
or false. School IT managers can take steps to minimize exposure to
unsavory comments. For example, by publishing to Facebook, but
not accepting friends, school IT managers can reduce the potential
for (but not eliminate) unsavory comments. Further, school leaders
can take be active users of social media and model professional
interaction and responding in a public manner.

CHAPTER 6: TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SYSTEMS

Sufficient devices, reliable and robust networks, and effective
web services all depend on a system being in place and
functioning to ensure the hardware and software is
maintained, updated, and repaired so it works for teachers and
learners. Efficacious IT managers ensure systems are in place
to keep IT infrastructure in good repair.

Computers break; they break frequently. Operational
computers, laptops, notebooks, and tablets (that connect to reliable
and robust networks through which access to effective web services)
exist only where there exist systems in place to quickly repair
malfunctioning devices (and networks and services). Effective and
efficient systems of technology support are multi-dimensional. IT
infrastructure must be selected and designed to facilitate effective
planning and repair, procedures for communicating when systems
need to be repaired as well as communicating that repairs are done
must be in place, and the proper personnel must be retained to affect
the repairs and those personnel have the necessary training and
budgets sufficient to meet their needs.

Logistic Goal
School IT managers will define a logistic goal that is similar
to “Malfunctioning IT systems are repaired quickly.” Implicit in this
goal is that malfunctioning devices or networks do not interfere with
teachers’ ability to plan for technology-rich lessons or with students’
ability to experience those lessons. Also, implicit in this goal is that

Efficacious Educational Technology

these systems are supported by the financial resources to supply the
people doing this work.

Context for the Logistic Goal
Computers and the information stored on them have
become mission-critical (excuse the business jargon) to schools.
Without these devices, neither teachers nor students can accomplish
what they must to achieve strategic goals, nor can administrative
staff ensure the smooth operation of the organization. Whereas “the
network going down” or “the computers being updated” represented
a minor disruption to previous generations of educators, either of
these situations can cause a major disruption today. Just as planning
for purchases and installation of devices can no longer be entrusted
to IT professionals alone, the design and implementation of support
systems ensuring appropriate, proper, and reasonable IT must be a
collaborative effort among all school IT managers.

Effective IT Systems
One of the often-overlooked aspects of technology support
systems is ensuring that systems are effectively repaired. Effective
repairs will result in the system better meeting the needs of teachers
and students and the systems being more responsive to their needs.
It has been established that IT users in schools are different from the
IT users in other organizations, so IT professionals who rely on the
clear planning that leads to the effective design of single-purpose
systems for business users will find they are less effective for school
users. Just like all aspects of managing school IT, selecting the
correct systems and designing them for school users is a
collaborative endeavor.
In schools where technology support systems are organized
into a planning cycle (see figure 6.1) in which technicians affect
changes and upgrades to reflect those identified as necessary by
teachers, repairs and upgrades appear to be more effective than
schools that lack such organization (Ackerman, 2017). In general,
IT managers react to situations to increase their efficiency, but they
are proactive to ensure changes to systems are more effective.
For technology support to be improved by following this
planning cycle, technicians and IT professional must be given
responsibility for building solutions in a manner that is secure and
139

Efficacious Educational Technology

compatible with existing technology, and teachers must use the
systems in the way the technicians designed them, but decisions
regarding the sufficiency of the solutions depend on teachers’
perceptions of the solutions, especially when interpreted in light of
technology acceptance.

Figure 6.1 Technology planning cycle (adapted from Ackerman,
2017)
The planning cycle provides efficacious IT managers with
a procedure to follow to ensure support decisions and actions are
fully implemented before they are deemed a success or a failure.
When the planning cycle is combined with the unified theory of
acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (Venktesh et al., 2003),
and feedback is given in terms of effort expectancy and performance
expectancy, then systems and the repairs made to them are more
likely to be judged effective by users.

Communication and Technology Support
Technology support is a process in school that bridges two
very clearly bounded groups of people; teachers, students, and other
users of IT comprise one group and the IT professionals who affect
repairs of IT comprise the other. This book is grounded in the
assumption that individuals in these groups understand technology
differently; implicit in this assumption is that they will use different
language when communicating about IT and that the same language
may have different meanings for the groups and for individuals. For
140

Efficacious Educational Technology

these reasons, efficacious IT managers take steps to ensure clear
communication between these groups. In the jargon of business
management, communication between different groups is called
horizontal to capture the movement of information across the
different groups (in school IT management these groups include
teachers, IT professionals, and school leaders).
Effective communication for technology support is enabled
by two web services, one to schedule shared resources and another
to manage requests for assistance. Effective communication also
depends on transparent and clear procedures when support ends,
including when repairs have been affected and when individuals
leave a school.

Scheduling Shared Resources
The collection of computer resources available in a school
will include those that are too expensive or too infrequently used to
justify purchasing them in large numbers. Compared to Internetonly notebooks that can be purchased for relatively low per unit cost
and can be used for productivity purposes in many settings,
computer rooms along with specialized devices such as large format
color printers, 3-D printers, and high-resolution projectors are
example of computing resources needed, but in smaller numbers, in
schools. Because the devices are in fewer numbers, they must be
shared, so efficacious IT managers provide a method whereby
teachers can schedule the resources for their students to use.
Effective tools make the schedules public, so they can be
viewed in the Internet without logging on or passing through other
barriers. (The most effective schedules will be mobile-compatible,
so the harried teacher who is finalizing plans for the day can say to
a student, “hey, go check the schedule to see if we can print our
posters in the computer lab today,” and the student will be able to
access and view the schedule on his or her phone.)
Once a student confirms the resource has not been
scheduled by another, the teacher can log on to the system to add a
reservation, but not edit others’ reservations. Further, each account
can have specific permissions so that he or she can reserve only the
resources appropriate for the user. For example, only those who
have received training in using the 3-D printer are allowed to
schedule time on it, or only those teachers whose course necessitate
special software can reserve certain computer rooms.
141

Efficacious Educational Technology

One of the difficulties that is commonly encountered with
using scheduling tools in schools is the unusual time increments that
characterize the daily schedules in many schools. While many
scheduling tools are designed for businesses that are likely to break
days into 15-minute increments, schools break days in various
chunks, and it is not unusual for different days to be divided into
different chunks. Further, some schools have multiple bell
schedules, for example students in grades 7 and 8 may follow the
“middle school schedule” but the students in 9-12 follow the “high
school schedule” in schools enrolling students in grades 7-12. IT
managers can increase the use of scheduling tool by making them
easy to use, including allowing users to select time blocks on the
schedule that correspond to the daily schedule blocks used in the
school. All of these can complicate the problem of sharing common
computing resources, but none generally are a barrier to sufficient
access.

Reporting, Ticketing, and Triage
The web service for managing repair requests that is webbased are often called “ticketing systems,” because one submits a
“help ticket” that summarizes a problem; the ticket is assigned to
someone with the skill and network credentials to fix the problem,
and notes regarding steps that are taken are added to the ticket. Once
the problem is resolved, the ticket is marked “closed,” and the
technicians moves on to new assignments.
The value of a fully functioning ticketing system is that it
facilitates communications regarding several aspects of managing a
large fleet of computer devices:
• Users can report malfunctioning devices with little effort, so
the system facilitates communication from users to IT staff.
Most IT managers place a link to “create a ticket” in
multiple places that computer users frequently visit (the
school web page, the LMS, and other portals). In addition,
IT managers create an email address, so users can send an
email to create a help ticket. Ideally, the ticketing system is
part of the collection of tools that use a single sign-on
scheme, so the individual who submits the ticket is
identified automatically and submitting a ticket does not
require on to log on to a different system.
142

Efficacious Educational Technology

• The technicians can triage malfunctioning devices and
decide the best use of their limited resources. While the
individual who submits the ticket can usually assign a
priority to the repair, the technicians can override those
settings, and repairs that will affect a greater number of
users or that restore critical systems can be given higher
priority.
• A history of each device is maintained. Devices that are
troublesome despite repeated repairs are known. Likewise,
technicians can track similar problems throughout the fleet.
This is particularly helpful when a design or hardware (or
software) problem affects the same model; steps taken to
resolve a problem on one unit are likely to resolve the same
problem on other units. In this point and the previous point,
there are examples of how the system facilitated
communication within the IT staff.
• Ticketing systems also provide a database on which the
inventory can be kept up-to-date. This helps IT
professionals understand their fleet and it helps leaders
understand the need to plan and budget for replacement
devices.
• The total number of repairs performed by technicians and
the time they spend on them can be recorded in the ticketing
system. This information is used to assess the efficiency and
effectiveness of the systems, so that support can be
improved by refining systems and by supporting those who
support IT users. In this point and the previous point, there
are examples of how the system facilitated communication
between IT staff and school administrators.

Avoiding Cold Closure
To avoid wasting instructional time preparing to use
technology that may or may not be functioning, teachers are likely
to avoid those devices that are malfunctioning (or even rumored to
be malfunctioning) until they are assured they have been repaired.
When a help ticket has been fixed, the technician closes it, then
moves on to other duties. While most ticketing systems notify the
143

Efficacious Educational Technology

individual who initiated the case that it has been closed, this can be
called a cold closure and it is opposed by a direct closure.
A direct closure occurs when the technician speaks with the
individual who reported it and confirms the issue has been resolved.
In the ideal situation, direct closure is done in-person, but a
telephone call or voice mail are better than cold closure. A teacher
who hears, “let me know if it does not work,” will have the
confidence to begin using the repaired systems.
Avoiding cold closure helps technicians reduce the
occurrence of a troubling situation. If the person reporting the
problem either inaccurately describes it or describes a situation with
incorrect terminology, then the technician can arrive at the computer
and not see what the person who submitted the ticket thought she or
he reported. Not seeing the anticipated symptoms, the technician
closes the ticket and moves on to other work. The individual who
reported the malfunction may return to the machine to discover it
still malfunctions because the technician affected no repair or the
technicians fixed different symptoms.
While direct closure does reduce technicians’ efficiency, it
can increase the effectiveness of repairs and it leads to more accurate
repairs being made (which ultimately increases efficiency). Closing
this loop of the repair process can be automated by ticketing
systems, but many recipients of those messages find them to be
confusing rather than informative. Consider the configuration of
communication that is set up in many ticketing systems. When the
message is entered into the database, a message is generated to tell
the individual who reported it “your message has been receive,” and
the individual who reported it may find additional messages
generated as the repair proceeds. While keeping individuals up-todate is important, many educators who receive these many messages
claim, “they just fill my inbox with unnecessary information.” The
excessive messages from the ticketing system can be especially
problematic for individuals who use the ticketing system frequently.
Because most IT managers insist problems be reported through the
ticketing system as it provides important information regarding the
fleet of these devices he or she manages, they must take steps to
make them easy-to-use and effective.

On-Boarding and Exiting
The term “on-boarding” is used to describe the process of
ensuring new employees understand policies and procedures related
144

Efficacious Educational Technology

to the organization. In recent decades, organizations have added IT
training to the on-boarding procedures. The details of the school IT
systems that must be the focus on on-boarding training have been
described previously, and comprehensive on-boarding training
decreases the need to support later.
Equally important are the steps taken when an individual
leaves a school. Separation can be for a variety of reasons, and
efficacious IT managers are prepared to transfer information as is
appropriate for those circumstances. In some cases, there are reasons
that separation must be immediate; in those cases, school
administrators are likely to direct an IT professional to immediately
prevent the separated individual from accessing systems, usually by
changing the individual’s password. Amicable and planned
separation is much more common and school IT managers seek to
implement exit procedures that ensure individuals can access
information they created while associated with the school.
Education is a creative endeavor; students and teachers both
create intellectual property as they work. In general, students who
are minors own the intellectual property they create (keep that in
mind the next time you copy a student’s paper to show colleagues).
For teachers, the ownership of the intellectual property they create
is more complicated. The works teachers create while being paid is
“work for hire,” thus those are owned by their employer. Works they
create while not being paid (during school breaks for example) are
not, and in other situations determination of who own teachers’
intellectual property can become very complicated. In most cases of
amicable separation, school leaders are content to avoid the conflict
over ownership of work created for hire by allowing educators to
retain a copy of all works he or she created. Educators are content
to avoid conflict by avoiding selling of works they created for a
specific teaching position without significantly revising the
materials, so they represent new works.
To accommodate educators and students who seek to retain
the works they created while employed at a school, school IT
managers can communicate to teachers recommended methods for
archiving and transferring them to their own devices or accounts.
With the widespread availability of cloud-based storage, many
technicians recommend copying contents of cloud-based folders or
LAN folders to cloud storage using accounts owned by the educator
or student who is leaving.

145

Efficacious Educational Technology

The situation can be more complicated when the educator
who is leaving has had a role in supervising and evaluating other
professionals or when the information containing works created by
the educator may pose a threat to one’s privacy or violate FERPA
regulations. Consider the principal who negotiates with the school
board to keep the laptop she or he has been using as part of a
retirement or resignation agreement; IT managers have a
responsibility to ensure that records of teacher observations and
evaluations, copies of letters sent to parents, and other sensitive
information is removed from the computer before ownership is
transferred to the separated principal.

Strategies to Increase Efficiency
For much of the history of computers in schools, the
“timeliness” of repairs was ill-defined and repair deadlines were not
critical. When computers were only one or two per classroom and
they were only marginally used in the curriculum, a computer being
inoperable for a few days or even weeks posed little disruption to
students’ work. This was largely due to the fact that computers were
simply replacing other technologies; for example, the middle school
students I visited as an undergraduate replaced graph paper and
pencils with computers to create graphs for their science fair
projects. Most of the information those students created and
consumed information was on paper, students could be engaged
even when “the computers are down.” As computer rooms arrived,
dysfunctional computers posed a greater obstacle to learning, but
only if the number of students exceeded the number of operational
workstations and as long as needed files were not on malfunctioning
computers.
As electronic digital information and interaction has come
to dominate, and computers have become vital to how information
is accessed, analyzed, and created in diverse classrooms; it has
become essential that malfunctioning computers be repaired in a
timely manner, with timely being defined in hours or days rather
than weeks. Especially in schools were one-to-one initiates are
underway, teachers plan their lessons based on the assumption that
students will have access to devices, so repairs need to be addressed
quickly to minimize the disruption to learning that arise from broken
computers. Responsive technology support systems, as a result, are

146

Efficacious Educational Technology

designed to increase the efficiency of technicians so that the time
between reporting it and it being resolved is minimal.
IT professionals adopt several strategies to increase their
efficiency. Interesting almost all malfunctioning IT can be traced to
software; files become corrupt, new devices or new hardware
introduce conflicts, and other temporary faults are introduced with
updates. Almost all of these software problems can be avoided or
resolved with a few strategies. Imaging allows technicians to reset
the software on entire systems, freezing prevents changes to the
software in systems, and remote access systems allow technicians to
log on to computers that are connected to networks from remote
locations and then affect software repairs.

Imaging
In the vocabulary of IT technicians, imaging refers to the
process of creating a file that contains the copy of a computer hard
drive, then sending that to the hard drives of other computers. This
strategy is particularly useful in situations where there are a large
number of the same model installed in one place.
Imaging occurs in three steps. First, a single computer is
configured exactly as it (and the others) needs to be. The operating
system and applications are updated, network settings established,
printers configured, and old data files are removed and unused
applications uninstalled, and any other maintenance tasks completed
prior to creating the image.
Second, the computer is restarted using software that
bypasses the operating system on the hard drive. This may be done
with software installed on a USB disk or that is stored at a network
location. Typically, this includes a minimal operating system, so
keyboards, network adapters, displays and similar tools function as
the software to create and receive the image file is loaded into the
random access memory. Third, the software imaging software is
used to either create an image or receive an image (overwrite the
current hard drive with the contents of a stored image).
There are several complicating factors in creating and using
images including:
• Images are model-specific. If a school distributes five
different models of laptops to teachers, then the IT staff
must manage five images, and they must be sure to deploy
the correct image to each model. More recent imaging
147

Efficacious Educational Technology

software is minimizing the need to manage different images
for each model, but the IT managers must still be clear about
exactly which software titles (including drivers and
extensions and configurations) need to be installed on each
model.
• It is essential that systems used to make images be
thoroughly tested before its images is made and deployed.
An error in setting up network printers on the computer used
to make the image, for example, can make a whole fleet of
computers unable to print if its image is deployed.
Technicians must confirm all settings are correct to avoid
the need to repeat the process.
• Some reconfiguration of recipient computers may be
necessary. Several factors such as the types of software
licenses that are on the hard drive used to create the image
and the specifies of how devices are named on the network
and the methods used to create user profiles determine how
much unit-specific configuration is necessary after it
receives an image.
• Imaging does irreversibly erase the contents of a hard drive,
so data that has not been backup-up is lost. For this reason,
technicians ask, “Do you need the data on this computer?”
more than once before reimaging a computer.
Typically, a technician will reimage a computer when it is
observed to have unusual and difficult-to-troubleshoot symptoms;
technicians are frequently heard to say, “Well, that is weird,”
immediately before deciding to reimage a computer. If a technician
suspects a computer has been infected by a virus or other malware,
then he or she is likely to reimage it as well. The great advantage of
this strategy from the technician’s point of view is that the system
will be set back to a “known good” configuration with a well-known
and standard practice. Further, in the hours that it takes for an image
to overwrite the hard drive on a malfunctioning computer, the
technician can attend to other repair, because the process completes
without further input from the technicians once it is started. Imaging
takes a few minutes to initiate, and several minutes to reconfigure

148

Efficacious Educational Technology

unit-specific settings, but when the image is being received, the
technician can attend to other work.
In addition to repairing malfunctioning computers, imaging
is used for large upgrade and maintenance projects on fleets of
computers. A common addition to the “to do” list of technicians
over the summer is to “image the computer room” (which may be
either desktop or laptop models). This finds a technician creating an
image then sending it to all of the computers in the room. This does
necessitate large amounts of data being transferred, so it can
interfere with network performance when it is underway (which
explains the need to do it over the summer). In all uses of imaging,
it is a method of resolving software problems with great efficiency.

Freezing
While imaging is a reaction to software changes that have
adversely affect the performance of a system, freezing is a strategy
that prevents software problems from occurring. A technician
installs the application that provides the freezing function and then
configures the system exactly as he or she wants it to function. Just
like imaging, all updates and applications are installed and the
network configuration along with network printers and other
peripherals are installed, configured, and tested. Once the
configuration is confirmed, the technician calls the freezing
software (which is running in the background, unseen by the user)
and enters a password which provides access to the controls that can
be used to change the state of the computer to “frozen” and restarts
the computer. Until it is “unfrozen” by a user who provides the
password, then each time the computer is restarted, it returns to the
state when it was frozen.
As software to freeze computers has been used, additional
features have been added. For example, the directories in which
operating systems updates are installed can be left “unfrozen” so
that necessary updates are not deleted when the computer is
restarted. Also, some user directories can be unfrozen, so that
documents created by users can be saved to a frozen computer.
While it does prevent many software-induced problems, there are
several reasons that IT managers may avoid using this solution:
• Commercial software to freeze computers can be very
expensive;
149

Efficacious Educational Technology

• Unless the version of the software allows for unfrozen
directories, it necessitates files be stored on systems other
than the local frozen hard drive;
• Unless properly configured, it can remove critical system
updates or data;
•As hard drives have approached and exceeded terabytes of
storage, the freezing process can lead to noticeable delays
in start-up which interfere with the perceived performance
of computers in many school settings.

Maintaining Extra Inventory
Especially in those schools in which there is an active oneto-one initiative, some IT managers will purchase extra computers
so that dysfunctional computers can be immediately replaced for
students. In some school IT shops where there is extra inventory
maintained, a student who finds his or her computer malfunctioning
for either software or hardware reasons will find a technician who
removes the hard drive (containing the operating system,
applications, network settings, and the students’ data) and installs it
in another unit that is identical to the first. This allows the students
to return to learning as normal and the technician to troubleshoot the
broken devices or return it for repair by the manufacturer after
updating the inventory and ticketing system so those records are
accurate.

On-Site and Remote Service
The efficiency of IT repairs can be improved by both
increasing the access to repairs on-site and increasing the capacity
for technicians to affect repairs remotely. While this may appear to
so obvious to be superfluous, the strategies and implications for IT
managers are quite different.
Assigning trained IT technicians to work in specific school
buildings and ensuring the technicians are well-known to students
and teachers and having them work in accessible and well-equipped
shops does result in repairs being more efficient, but hiring and
retaining employees tends to be a very expensive option in schools
(and all other organizations). The question is often asked by school
leaders, “How many technicians do we need given the size of our
150

Efficacious Educational Technology

fleet?” Many variables (including the age of the machines, the
operating system and other applications installed, the nature of the
network, the robustness of the design, and the type of use to which
the machines are subjected) affect the number of repairs needed in
a given time and the complexity of those repairs. Because of these
many variables, there is no reliable heuristic for calculating the
number of IT technicians that are needed for a fleet. If the load of
repairs overwhelms the available technicians on a regular basis, then
steps must be taken to improve their capacity to affect repairs; this
can be by providing the technicians with more training or better
work conditions, or hiring additional technicians to chare the work.
Placing a technician in every school to be the primary
source of IT support at that site does improve efficiency of repairs
but coincidently it increases dependence on that technician, thus
efficiency can actually decrease. When teachers and others depend
on the technician, they are unlikely to develop their own
troubleshooting skills, so rather than resolving a problem with a few
minutes of troubleshooting, productivity (or at least technology-rich
productivity) stops while the technician is summoned then arrives
to affect the same steps that are within the capacity of other adults.
Not only does a technician-dependent teacher demonstrate poor
capacity to learn and to problem-solve, but he or she can delay
opportunities for learning while waiting for technicians to become
available. Further, this can take technicians away from jobs that
require their expertise, so both repairs are delayed. For these
reasons, when on-site technicians are place in schools, there must be
clear rules about what constitutes an IT emergency, and clear
expectations of troubleshooting steps and procedures teachers are
trained to take and are expected to take prior to seeking assistance.
Technicians also increase efficiency by using remote access
tools log on to desktop and laptops computers form any place on the
network. Using remote access, they can install and update software,
change configurations, troubleshoot, and otherwise manage those
workstations over the network. Access to remote access tools is
closely managed by IT managers as it can be used for nefarious
purposes as well as legitimate troubleshooting and repair. These
tools often use protocols and ports that can be exploited by malware,
and using these tools can expose the computer systems and the data
stored on them to the threat of unauthorized access.

Technology Roles to Fulfill
Information technology professionals comprise a diverse
group of professionals and the skills necessary for one specialty
within the field are not necessarily transferable to others. Hiring
professionals that fulfill the needed role in a school with the
appropriate skills necessitates school leaders understand the
specialties within IT professions. It is also important for school
leaders to accurately and clearly define expectations and that IT
professionals can clearly match job descriptions with his or her
skills. Accurately describing and filling positions also avoids the
waste of paying for skills that are unused or for needing to provide
unbudgeted consultants to fill gaps in the knowledge or skill of hired
individuals.
Regardless of the positions funded in budgets and the
staffing decisions made by school leaders, all of the roles described
in this section must be filled by individuals if a technology support
system is to be comprehensive and complete. The titles given to the
positions that fill these roles vary and the nature of the individual
retained to fill the roles are determined by local circumstances, but
strategies utilizing full-time employees, part-time employees, shortterm employees, and consultants have been effective, and of course,
a single individual can play multiple roles. It is rare, however, to
find one individual who can fulfill each role with expertise.

Chief Information Officer
It is only recently that educational organizations have
adopted the practice of using “c-level” title for those in management
positions. Chief financial officers (CFO) manage the business
operations of schools and chief academic officers (CAO) are
responsible for all aspects of teaching and learning within schools;
individuals in these roles report to the chief executive officer (CEO)
who typically hold the position of superintendent of schools. Added
to the c-level of management in organizations including schools is
the chief information officer (CIO) who manages all aspects of the
information technology systems within the organization.
Of course, no c-level executive managers work and lead
within a vacuum, so—at the highest level—decisions are made to
satisfy the needs and limitations of the entire organization, but the
c-level manager is then responsible to carry out the implementations
those decisions within his or her area of leadership. The role of the
152

Efficacious Educational Technology

CIO in schools is to advise the other top-level leaders on the nature
of the existing technology, the steps necessary to maintain it, and
the potential changes that will improve it. Of the many decisions
made by the CIO, perhaps none is more important that those
involved with installing and upgrading information networks. The
individual who fills this role in a school has a level of responsibility
similar to those of the other c-level managers and will be qualified
by having a comparable level of experience and credentials
(including having earned advanced degrees). The CIO will be
compensated at a similar level as well.
For much of the history of computers in schools, a single
individual was allowed to decide what technology to buy and how
to install it. The rationale behind this practice was that those
individuals held quite specialized expertise and educators were
willing to defer to those with greater expertise. In many cases, that
method of decision-making led to technology that was ineffective
and even led to conflict as technology decisions were made for
technology reasons. As CIO’s have been integrated into technology
decision-making in schools, there has been a shift towards making
technology decisions for teaching and learning reasons. The specific
role of the CIO is to advocate for technology that both meets the
need of member of the organization and that is reliable and robust.
He or she will advocate for rational decisions regarding
infrastructure planning, personnel decisions, and support, at the
same time he or she ensures technology decisions do not hamper
teaching and learning or other organizational goals.
In some colleges and universities, the IT decisions related
to teaching and learning are made by the CAO and the CIO builds
and maintains the systems deemed necessary by the academic
leaders. That model has yet to become wide-spread (especially in K12 education), but it is anticipated it will become more common.

System Administrators
Once computer networks are installed and configured
(usually in consultation with external engineers and technicians),
system administrators employed by the school ensure they remain
operational and functional. These professionals listen for network
problems by both attending to reports of malfunctions from users
and by monitoring system logs, and they both resolve problems that
are identified and they take steps to ensure continued health of the
network.
153

Efficacious Educational Technology

Among the specific responsibilities of IT system
administrators is ensuring users and devices can access network
resources, configuring software to backup files and checking those
files are being created as expected, upgrading the operating system
and driver software on the servers, and otherwise maintaining
network hardware and software. They also play an important role in
planning for and deploying software and hardware upgrades, and
this individual pays particular attention to potential conflicts that
may be introduce when networks are changed. In general, if changes
are made to a device that manages local area network traffic or that
stores data accessed from across the LAN, it is the system
administrator who performs the task. This individual will also work
closely with technicians to ensure that use devices are properly
configured to access the LAN and Internet.
Most system administrators have completed an
undergraduate degree in information systems, and they are also
likely to hold credentials awarded by IT vendors and professional
organizations. In many cases these credentials require effort and
understanding that is comparable to graduate certificates and
graduate degrees in their field. As a result of their level of training
and expertise, system administrators should be compensated at a
rate similar to teachers, but their salary should reflect the year-round
nature of their work.

Technicians
Technicians are the individuals who have one of the most
important roles in IT system operations in schools as they are the
face of the IT department to most members of the organization. A
technician is likely to spend his or her day troubleshooting and
repairing end users’ devices such as PC’s, laptops, printers, and
other peripherals. Because these professionals spend they time
interacting with teachers and students, it is essential they have
excellent customer service skills and are comfortable interacting
with teachers when they are in stressful situations (due to
malfunctioning computers) and with frustrated students. On those
staffs with multiple technicians, the group can be very
interdependent; they collaborate on solving problems and give each
other tips. By documenting the repairs they make (ideally in the
ticketing system), technicians contribute to the emerging knowledge
of the IT systems and they are identifying those that are becoming
so dysfunctional as to need replacement. A further role of
154

Efficacious Educational Technology

technicians is to identify network problems that need to be resolved
by the network administrator.
The CIO plays an active role in ensuring the technicians
who are working in the school receives the professional courtesies
and the on-going support they deserve. Many technicians arrive in
these positions with an associate degree or similar levels of training
that prepare them to understand the systems that will repair, but in
many cases, they do not have experience with the specific devices
or the specific practices in use in a school, they must receive training
as part of their jobs to stay current and to provide on-going support.

Data Specialists
A relatively new specialist to join the IT staff is the data
specialist. The need for this specialist arises from both the skills
necessary to manage the databases in which demographic, health,
behavioral, academic, and other information that is housed
regarding students and the increasing demand for data-driven
practices. Schools store vast amounts of data in sophisticated
databases; while inputting the data is a minor aspect of the work and
it requires limited expertise, the expertise necessary to prepare and
run queries of the database so that questions regarding correlations
and performance can be answered requires much greater expertise.
Often this work includes creating scripts that produce reports that
are used to support decisions made by school administrators and
teachers.
These professionals represent one the first ventures into the
field of educational data analytics by schools. In this field, educators
seek to apply the methods of data science to predict student needs
and performances. It should be noted that these methods have
proven informative for some aspects of learning (Macfadyen, 2017),
but findings suggest they are not useful in predicting deeper learning
(Makani, Durier-Copp, Kiceniuk, & Blandford, 2016).

Customer Service Skills
Regardless of the role or she fills, all IT professionals who
work in schools should be expected to demonstrate excellent
customer service skills. “Customer service” is not a term commonly
associated with education professionals, but they are skills needed
for those who are providing technology support. Exactly what is
meant by customer service also depends, but—in general—users
155

Efficacious Educational Technology

and managers recognize those who can identify problems and can
resolve them quickly and with a pleasant disposition as having good
customer service skills.
Individuals identified as demonstrating good customer
serviced skills typically have excellent knowledge of the systems or
products they are supporting. In addition, they have the capacity to
resolve problems in creative and flexible manners, especially when
the standard methods prove ineffective. Together, these elements of
customer service represent professional knowledge that can be
applied efficiently and effectively.
In addition, those with good customer service skills have
patient and empathetic personalities. This nature allows them to
listen carefully so that they clearly and accurately understand the
problem being presented and they recognize its importance. They
also avoid the temptation to blame the use for problems with the
computer. At the same time, a technician with good customer
service skills will see problem solving and troubleshooting as an
opportunity to teach the user strategies for avoiding similar problem
and resolving them with independence if they arise.
Regardless of the role an IT professional plays in a school,
good customer service skills are important. Improving these will
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of IT support systems.

156

CHAPTER 7: DISCOURSE, DESIGN, DATA

IT planning is a necessarily collaborative endeavor in schools.
Because it requires those with disparate skills and approaches
to collaborate, efficacious IT managers adopt methods they
will use to make decisions and they use data upon which they
agree. Especially as they begin collaborative planning, school
IT managers can benefit from framing their work as discourse
that leads to and is informed by design which makes use of
research-like data.

Schools are organizations in which leaders are constantly
seeking to improve performance. Improvement and performance are
difficult concepts to define and quantify, but (like many inexact
concepts) we can recognize it when we see it. Improving school IT
requires managers to decide what improvements they seek to make,
what evidence will indicate success, and how to make them.
Improvements can be made by deploying new interventions,
refining how existing interventions are instantiated, ceasing those
that are ineffective or inefficient, and consolidating others. The
strategies used to make these decisions can influence the support the
decisions receive in the community and the ultimate success or
failure of the decisions from the perspective of the many
stakeholders.
For school IT managers, planning is made more
complicated than it is for leaders of other organizations because
schools are filled with diverse populations. The result of these
complications is that problems can be differently defined and

Efficacious Educational Technology

framed by different participants. They can also propose, design, and
deploy much different solutions; further they assess the same
solution very differently. What represents a successful solution to a
technology solution to one participant (or one group of participants)
can pose a severe barrier to technology by others. To minimize the
threats to efficacy, and to promote more effective and efficient
decision-making and problem solving, school IT managers can
adopt formal processes for the collaborative planning. Following
agreed upon methods to define problems, clarify intended
improvements, and gather and analyze data help the disparate
groups involved in efficacious IT management to make sound
decisions.

Data versus Evidence
“Data” has been widely, but imprecisely, used in education
for most of the 21st century. Data-driven educators make decisions
based on information they have gathered about their students’
performance. Ostensibly, this is done in an attempt to adopt the
position of a researcher and to ground decisions in objective
research, thus give more support for their decisions. Upon closer
inspection, however, there is little resemblance between data
collection, the data, and the analysis methods used by researchers
and those used by most “data-driven educators.”
Data-driven educators tend to use data that is conveniently
available; this data is almost always scores on a standardized or
standards-based tests. These tests include both large scale and high
stakes tests and also those administered by teachers in the classroom
for diagnostic purposes. The validity and reliability of these tests is
rarely questioned; educators who claim to be data-driven accept that
the tests accurately measure what the publishers claim. Data-driven
educators also tend to seek interesting and telling trends in the data,
but rarely do they seek to answer specific questions using their data.
Further, they rarely use theory to interpret results; it is assumed that
instruction determined the scores and that changes to instruction
affected all trends they observe.
Researchers, on the other hand, define the questions they
seek to answer and the data methods they will use prior to gathering
data; they gather only the data they need, and all data is interpreted
in light of theory. Researchers challenge themselves and their peers
to justify all assumptions and to demonstrate the validity and
158

Efficacious Educational Technology

reliability of instruments that generate data and they challenge
themselves and peers to demonstrate the quality of their data and
conclusions; for researchers, conclusions based on invalid or badly
(or unethically) collected data must be discarded by credible
researchers and managers.
By adopting a stance towards data that more closely
resembles research than data-driven decision-making, IT managers
tend to base their decisions in data that is more valid and reliable
than is commonly used in education. Their decisions are also more
likely to be grounded in theory that helps explain the observations.
Other benefits of adopting a research-like stance towards data and
evidence include:
• More efficient processes as planners use theory to focus
efforts on relevant factors and only relevant factors;
• More effective decisions, because multiple reliable and
valid data are used;
• More effective interventions, because they focus on locally
important factors and there is a clear rationale for actions;
• Assessments and evaluations of interventions are more
accurate and more informative for further efforts because
evidence is clear and clearly understood.
Research is generally differentiated into two types. Pure
research is designed to generate and test theory, which contains
ideas about how phenomena work and allows researchers to predict
and explain what they observe. Applied research is undertaken to
develop useful technologies that leverage the discoveries of pure
research; applied research is often called technology development.
Scholars who engage in pure research identify and provide evidence
for cause and effect relationships; this is typically done through
tightly controlled experiments and quantitative data. Scholars and
practitioners who engage in applied research or technology
development seek to produce efficient and effective tools (see figure
7.1).

159

Efficacious Educational Technology

Figure 7.1. Continuum of pure and applied research
In 1997, Donald Stokes suggested designing a project to be
one type of research does not prevent one from doing the other type,
so the dichotomy of pure and applied research is misleading.
According to Stokes, many researchers seek to create new
knowledge and to solve human problems simultaneously; he
suggested replacing the continuum of pure to applied research with
a matrix in which one axis is labeled “Do researchers seek new
understanding?” and the other is labeled “Do researchers seek to use
their discoveries?” By dividing each axis into “yes” and “no”
sections, four types of research emerge (see figure 7.2).

Figure 7.2. Matrix of research activities
160

Efficacious Educational Technology

Pure and applied research as they were originally conceived
do remain on this new matrix. The cognitive scientists who study
brain structure and function with little concern for converting their
discoveries into interventions are pure researchers whose work may
ultimately affect education, but designing interventions is not their
primary purpose. The activity of computer programmers who are
developing and refining educational games falls into the technology
development quadrant. In general, they seek to build systems that
are efficient, and they build their systems to leverage the discoveries
of cognitive scientists, but their work does not contribute to new
understanding.
Stokes’ matrix introduces a category of research in which
there is neither intent to make new discoveries nor intent to apply
any discoveries. While it may seem a null set, there are interesting
and fulfilling hobbies such as bird watching that fall into this
quadrant. Similar activities are those in which discoveries and
applications of knowledge is for personal fulfillment and
entertainment. Stokes’ matrix also introduces a category of activity
in which the researcher intends to both make new discoveries and
apply the discoveries; he labeled this “use-inspired research” and
referred to it as Pasteur’s quadrant. You may recall Louis Pasteur
was a 19th century French biologist and he “wanted to understand
and to control the microbiological processes he discovered” (Stokes,
1997 p. 79). Pasteur’s approach was to both explain the natural
science of these diseases and to define interventions that would
prevent them. In the same way, IT managers seek to build
efficacious systems in their schools and to understand what makes
them so.
At the center of use-inspired research is an intervention
which is designed to solve a problem. In school IT management,
interventions will include many and diverse systems of hardware,
software, and procedures and methods to use that hardware and
software. Because it is focus of research, interventions can be
understood in terms of theory. Theory explains what is observed,
and theory predicts what will be observed when systems are
changed. Because it is the focus of technology development,
interventions are revised so that desired changes are observed. Useinspired researchers also seek to observe performance in multiple
ways. A single measure is not sufficient for the efficacious IT
manager whose planning and decision-making is grounded in useinspired research.
161

Efficacious Educational Technology

Education and research form a complex situation.
Education is a field of active and diverse research; pure research,
technology development, action research, and evaluation research
all contribute to emerging collection of research. Further, a course
in education research is part of almost every graduate program in
the field, so many education professionals believe they have a
sophisticated capacity to use and even generate research. Despite
this, Carr-Chellman and Savoy (2004) observed that inattention to
evidence and data in education led to “many innovations being less
than acceptable or usable and rarely effectively implemented,” but
they concluded, “frustration with the lack of relevant useful results
have led to more collaborative efforts to design, develop,
implement, and benefit from research, processes, and products” (p.
701). Given this observation, it is reasonable to conclude that useinspired research will improve the collaborative efforts so school IT
systems are properly, appropriately, and reasonably designed.

Educational Design Research as a Source of Data
Scholars and practitioners in many fields have developed
use-inspired research methods specific to the problems they solve
and the interventions they design. Educational design research
(McKenny & Reeves, 2012). McKenny & Reeves (2014) captured
the dual nature of educational design as a method for designing
interventions and a method for generating theory, as they noted it is
motivated by “the quest for ‘what works’ such that it is underpinned
by a concern for how, when, and why is evident….” (p. 23). They
further describe educational design research as a process that is:
• Theoretically oriented as it is both grounded in current and
accepted knowledge and it seeks to contribute new
knowledge;
• Interventionist as it is undertaken to improve products and
processes for teaching and learning in classrooms;
• Collaborative as the process incorporates expert input from
stakeholders who approach the problem from multiple
perspectives;

162

Efficacious Educational Technology

• Naturalistic as it both recognizes and explores the
complexity of educational processes and it is conducted
within the setting where it is practiced (this is opposed to
the pure researcher’s attempt to isolate and control factors,
thus simplifying the setting);
• Iterative as each phase is complete only after several cycles
of inquiry and discourse.
Projects in educational design research typically comprise
three phases (see figure 7.3), and each phase addresses the problem
as it is instantiated in the local school and it is either grounded in or
contributes to the research or professional literature. For school IT
managers, the analysis/ exploration phase of educational design
research is focused on understanding the existing problem, how it
can be improved, and what will be observed when it is improved.
These discussions typically engage the members of the technology
planning committee who are the leaders among the IT managers.
Design/ construction finds school IT managers designing and
redesigning interventions; this phase is most effective when it is
grounded in the planning cycle described in Chapter 6. Reflection/
evaluation finds them determining if the solution was successful and
also articulating generalizations that can inform the participants’
further work and that can be shared with the greater community of
school IT managers.

Figure 7.3. Phases of educational design research (adapted from
Ackerman, in press)

Defining Improvement
Efficacious IT management depends on all participants
maintaining a shared understanding of the problem and the intended
improvements; it also depends on discourse so that the participants
communicate their perspectives so the systems are properly
configured, appropriate for students and teachers, and reasonable
given the norms and limits of the school. This can only be
163

Efficacious Educational Technology

accomplished through effective communication, which is
threatened by the differences that mark the groups.
Carl Bereiter (2002), an educational psychologist, described
discourse as a form of professional conversation through which
psychologists can “converse, criticize one another’s ideas, suggest
questions for further research, and—not least—argue constructively
about their differences” (p. 86). This description appears to present
discourse as a type of interaction similar to the discussion and debate
that characterizes political dialogue and decision making. Bereiter
specifies, however, discourse is grounded in data and evidence, so
it is a tool for scientific inquiry rather than for political discussions.
Bereiter extends the application of discourse to planning for
education, and specifically he suggests progressive discourse as a
method whereby planners can define continuous improvement,
implement interventions, and assess the effectiveness of those
interventions. In general, progressive discourse is the work of
expanding fact to improve conceptual artifacts; this work
necessitates a nonsectarian approach to data and decisions.
Planning is the process by which spoken ideas and written
language is converted in to actions. Conceptual artifacts are those
actions that can be observed in social systems and that are described
in the language used to express plans. Progressive discourse
depends on planners sharing an understanding of both the language
used to capture plans and the actions that will be observed when
those plans are realized. Scardamelia and Bereiter (2006) observed
progressive discourse depends on participants’ “commitment to
seek common understanding rather than merely agreement” (p.
102). If IT managers agree on the language they use to define
strategic and logistic goals, but not on what they will observe when
the logistic goal is achieved, then they do not share a conceptual
artifact. Their plans and interventions are likely to be inefficient and
ineffective.
In education, we can observe many situations in which
different conceptual artifacts are instantiated. There is, for example,
a growing interest in using games as a method of motivating
students and giving context for deeper understanding. Ke (2016)
observed, “A learning game is supposed to provide structured and
immersive problem-solving experiences that enable development of
both knowledge and a ‘way of knowing’ to be transferred to
situation outside of the original context of gaming or learning” (p.
221). Contained within that conceptual artifact of “learning games”
164

Efficacious Educational Technology

is cognitive activity that causes learners to interact with information
and that leads to understanding sufficiently sophisticated that it can
be used flexibly. Such games have been found to contribute to
effective and motivating learning environments (Wouters & van
Oostendorp, 2017).
Ke’s conceptual artifact of learning games contrasted with
the observation I made while visiting a school and watching students
who were completing a computerized test preparation program.
After students had correctly answered a certain number of questions,
the program launched an arcade-style game that had no connection
to the content. It appeared the games were intended to motivate the
students and provide a reward for giving correct answers. The
principal identified this practice as an example of how his teachers
were “integrating educational games into their lessons.” The
students had discovered the arcade games appeared after a certain
number of correct answers and they were “gaming” the system by
randomly answering questions by randomly submitting answers in
a strategy that led to the games appearing more quickly than if they
tried to answer the questions. While the value of determining how
to get to the games without answering the questions can be debated,
it did not require students to engage with the content. We can
reasonably conclude the principal and Ke did not share a conceptual
artifact regarding games.
If the principal and Ke were on a technology planning
committee together, then we can assume they might both agree that
“learning games can be valuable,” but their understandings of the
experiences that represent learning games would be different. They
would agree on language, but not actions, so they would not share a
conceptual artifact. The planning committee with Ke and the
principal would find it necessary to continue to discuss learning
games and resolve their differences so that decisions about what
comprise “learning games” were common to the pair.
As progressive discourse proceeds, the participants build
greater knowledge from outside sources (new research and new
discoveries) and from inside sources (experiences with their own
system and community). This knowledge can cause managers to
reconsider the definition and realization of a conceptual artifact.
When redefining conceptual artifacts, IT managers may be tempted
to accept a broader definition, but new and more nuanced conceptual
artifacts are generally improvements over the current ones. In this
case, the committee may choose to improve the conceptual artifact
165

Efficacious Educational Technology

by differentiating “learning games” from “games for reward” and
proceeding with two conceptual artifacts rather than using one
definition that is too broadly applied. Improvement of conceptual
artifacts occurs when:
• Planners develop a more sophisticated understanding of
what they intend in the conceptual artifacts;
• Conceptual artifacts are replaced with more precise ones;
• Managers communicate the conceptual artifacts so more
individuals representing more stakeholders share the
conceptual artifact;
• IT managers take steps so the conceptual artifacts are
implemented with increased efficiency;
• Conceptual artifacts are implemented with greater
effectiveness by increasing alignment between conceptual
artifact and practice, removing those practices that are the
least aligned, or using conceptual artifacts to frame activity
in situations where they are not currently used.
Progressive discourse is especially useful during the
analysis/ exploration of a problem. It is during this phase of
educational design research (McKenny & Reeves, 2012) that IT
managers improve their understanding of the problem and the
conceptual artifacts that represent solutions. This is a research
activity, thus it cannot be undertaken to support a political
conclusion, to accommodate economic circumstances, or to confirm
a decision been made prior to beginning. Ignoring facts because they
appear to violate one’s political, religious, economic, or pedagogical
sensibilities or because they are contrary to those espoused by
another who is more powerful is also inconsistent with the process.
Equally inconsistent is selecting evidence so it conforms to
preferred conclusions; educational design research and progressive
discourse builds knowledge upon incomplete, but improving,
evidence that is reasonably and logically analyzed in a manner that
researchers approach evidence rather than through political
preferences. These may be reasons to accept decisions, but decision-

166

Efficacious Educational Technology

makers have a responsibility to be transparent and to identify the
actual reason for making the decision.
Schools, of course, are political organizations and different
stakeholders will perceive the value of conceptual artifacts their
improvements differently. First, individuals’ understanding of the
artifacts and acceptance of the values embodied in the conceptual
artifacts varies. Because of this, one individual (or groups of
individuals) may perceive a change to be an improvement while
others perceive the same change to be a degradation; this is
unavoidable as it arises from the wicked (Rittel & Weber, 1973)
nature of school planning. Second, some participants in the
progressive discourse are likely to have a more sophisticated
understanding of the conceptual artifacts than others, so they may
find it necessary to explain their understanding and build others’
understanding of the conceptual artifacts. Further, those with less
sophisticated understanding may find their ideas challenged by
unfamiliar conceptual artifacts. Third, understanding of and value
placed on the conceptual artifacts becomes more precarious when
including stakeholders who are most removed from the operation of
the organization.
Consider again the example of learning games; it illustrates
the implications for various stakeholders when a conceptual artifact
improves. If the planning committee decided the arcade-style games
in the test preparation violate the accepted conceptual artifact of
learning games, the committee may recommend banning arcadestyle games in the school. A teacher who uses such games to
improve students’ speed at recalling math facts may find this
“improvement” weakens her instruction. That math teacher may
argue for a more precise understanding of arcade-style games, so
those she uses are recognized as different from those in the testpreparation program.
If discussions about the role of games in the classroom
spilled into the public (which they often do in today’s social mediarich landscape), then the continued use of learning games, regardless
of their instructional value, might be challenged by those whose
oppose game playing in any form by students, especially those
stakeholders who do not see students engaged with games in
classrooms. This could change political pressures making
progressive discourse more difficult.

167

Efficacious Educational Technology

Designing Interventions
IT managers seek to improve conceptual artifacts through
designing interventions. Decisions about which conceptual artifacts
to improve and how to improve them are made as IT managers
explore/ analyze the local situation. Interventions are designed
through iterative processes informed by the technology planning
cycle shown in figure 6.1.
There are deep connections and similarities between design
and research. Both activities progress through problem setting
(understanding the context and nature of the problem), problem
framing (to understand possible solutions) and problem solving
(taking actions to reach logistic goals). Both design and research
find participants understanding phenomena, which affects decisions
and actions that are evaluated for improvement of idea or
interventions. “Design itself is a process of trying and evaluating
multiple ideas. It may build from ideas, or develop concepts and
philosophies along the way. In addition, designers, throughout the
course of their work, revisit their values and design decisions”
(Hokenson, 2012, p. 72). This view of design supports the iterative
nature of design/ construction of educational design research. Initial
designs are planned and constructed in response to new discoveries
made by IT managers; these discoveries can come from the
literature or from deeper understanding of the local instances. In
terms of progressive discourse, redesign/ reconstruction decisions
are made as conceptual artifacts are improved.
One of the challenges that has been recognized in school IT
planning is the fact that the expertise necessary to properly and
appropriately configure technology is usually not found in the same
person. As one who has worked in both the world of educators and
the world of information technology professionals, I can confirm
that we do not want educators to be responsible for managing IT
infrastructure and we do not want IT professionals making decisions
about what happens in classrooms. A recurring theme in this book
has been the collaborative work that results in efficacious IT
management. In design/ construction this collaboration is most
important.
School leaders have the authority to mediate decisions
about whose recommendations are given priority at any moment.
The attentive school leader will be able to ascertain where in the
iterative planning cycle any design/ construction activity is and will
resolve disputes accordingly. If teachers are complaining about how
168

Efficacious Educational Technology

difficult a system is to use, then the school leader will determine if
the proper use has been explained to the teachers and will determine
if the complaining teachers are using the technology as it has been
designed. If teachers are not using the system as it has been
designed, then the school leader will direct teachers to follow
instructions. If they are using the system as designed, but it is still
inefficient or ineffective, then the school leader will direct the IT
professionals to change the configuration of the system to more
closely satisfy the teachers. When there is uncertainty about which
configuration to direct, school leaders should accommodate teachers
and students whenever it is reasonable, as the experiences of
students are most critical to the purpose of the school.

Understanding Interventions
School and technology leaders who model their
management after educational design research will engage in a
process by which they make sense of the interventions that were
implemented and the evidence they gathered. This process is
intended to accomplish two goals. First, the IT managers seek to
evaluate the degree to which the interventions contributed to the
school achieving its strategic and logistic goals. Second, IT
managers assess their interventions, the evidence they gathered, and
the nature of their designs and products; through this inquiry, they
articulate generalizations that can be applied to other planning
problems. Based on the view of educational design and progressive
discourse that has been presented in this chapter, it is more accurate
to suggest IT managers evaluate the degree to which strategic and
logistic goals are improved than to suggest IT managers evaluate the
achievement of goals. Many school IT managers are motivated to
analyze/ explore, then design/ construct interventions, to resolve a
situation that is perceived to be a problem, so they will continue
design/ construction iterations until the interventions are deemed
satisfactory, and the problem solved. Even those interventions that
are quickly deemed to have solved the problem should be the focus
of evaluation/ assessment so the factors that led to the improvements
can be articulated and used to inform other decisions and shared
with other IT managers.
Compared to those who rely simply on data measured on a
single instrument, IT planners who engage in educational design
research use more sophisticated evidence to frame their work and
this allows them to support more sophisticated generalizations.
169

Efficacious Educational Technology

They can explain their rationale for the initial design decisions that
were made as well as the design decisions made during each
iteration; they can explain their conclusions and evaluate their
evidence. They also tend to have deeper understanding of how the
interventions were instantiated in the local community than other
planners, so they can clarify the factors that were relevant for local
circumstances and they are more prepared to evaluate the
appropriateness of the conceptual artifacts, the cost of
improvements, as well as to identify unintended consequences of the
interventions. All of this contributes to decisions to maintain or
change priorities for continued efforts to improve aspects of
technology-rich teaching and learning.
Because their design decisions are grounded in theory and
the data they collect are interpreted in light of that theory, IT
managers use the theory as a framework to understand what effect
their interventions and why those effects occurred. If predictions
were not observed, then the situation can be more closely interpreted
to either identify problems with the prediction, the evidence
collected, or the design and construction of the intervention. It is
also possible to identify unforeseen factors that affected a particular
intervention, but this can only be done when theory is used to
interpret the observations.
Generalizations that appear to be supported by observations
can also be reported to the greater community, typically in
presentations at conferences or in articles published in periodicals.
This reporting of findings increases one’s professional knowledge
of important practices and it also exposes the work to criticisms and
reviews that improve the capacity of the IT manager to continue and
that help all participants refine and clarify their knowledge.
The degree to which IT managers’ evaluation of
interventions in the local community are valid and reliable and the
degree to which their generalizations are accepted by the greater
professional community is determined by the quality of the evidence
they present. Evidence is based in fact. In the vernacular, fact
typically means information that is true and accurate. Implicit, also,
is the assumption that the fact is objectively defined so every
observer will agree on the both reality of the fact and the meaning
of the fact. For researchers, facts are grounded in assumptions and
established through observation, and observation can refute an idea
that was long-thought to be a true fact. For IT managers using
educational design research to frame decisions, they seek to
170

Efficacious Educational Technology

recognize assumptions and make decisions based on multiple
observations.
Consider the example of a school in which school leaders
become aware of evidence that hybrid learning is positively
associated with students’ course grades (for example Scida & Saury,
2006). They may direct IT managers to install and configure a
learning management system (LMS) so teachers can supplement
their face-to-face instruction with online activities. Recognizing
there is ambiguous evidence of the effectiveness of hybrid and elearning tools and platforms on learning (Desplaces, Blair, &
Salvaggio, 2015), the IT managers who deployed the LMS may be
interested in answering the question, “Did use of the LMS affect
students’ learning?” Data-driven IT managers might simply
compare the grades of students in sections that used the LMS to
grades of students in sections that did not use the LMS. Those
planners are assuming grades in courses really do reflect changes in
what a student knows and can do (rather than reflecting teachers’
biases for example).
The first step in answering the question would be to
ascertain if there was a difference in the grades between the students
who used the LMS and those who do not. In adopting a researchlike stance towards the data, the IT managers would look for
statistically significant differences between the grades of students in
sections that used the LMS and those that did not. They may choose
a specific course to study to minimize the number of variables that
affect their observations. The efficacious IT manager would
recognize these differences could be accounted for by many
variables in addition to the use of the LMS and effects of the LMS
might not appear in this initial comparison. Completely
understanding the effects of the LMS of students’ learning of
Algebra 1 (for example) necessitates further evidence and data; the
most reliable and valid evidence includes data from at least three
data sources. When studying the LMS, IT managers might answer
three questions about the LMS and their students (see figure 7.4).
One relevant measurement might be to compare the
performance of different cohorts of students’ performance on a
common test, such as a final exam given to all Algebra 1 students.
Finding statistically significant differences between the scores of
students who enrolled in a section in which the LMS was used
compared those who enrolled in a section that did not use the LMS

171

Efficacious Educational Technology

Figure 7.4 Multiple sources of data
might indicate an effect of the LMS rather than an unrecognized
effect. To minimize bias in such data collection, steps should be
taken to ensure all of the exams were accurately scored and the
statistical tests should be performed by those who do not know
which group used the LMS (the treatment) and which did not (the
control). This is an example of a quasi-experimental design, as the
students in this case are unlikely to have been randomly assigned to
the sections.
A second observation might be to ascertain if greater use of
the LMS is associated with higher scores within sections that used
the LMS. The IT managers would have the ability to analyze access
logs kept on the LMS that records when individual users log on to
the system, and these patterns could be compared to individual
students’ grades to determine if there is a correlation between use of
the LMS and grades. While a positive correlation between access
and grades does not necessarily indicate causation, such positive
evidence can corroborate other observations.
A third source of evidence to understand the effects of the
LMS on student grades might be to interview students to ascertain
their experience using the LMS; the qualitative data collected in this
way will help explain differences observed (or not observed) in
other data. Together, these three sources of evidence given greater
insight into the effects of the LMS on students’ learning than simply
comparing grades.

172

Efficacious Educational Technology

Rationale for the Effort
Compared to other planning methods and other methods of
gathering data and evidence, educational design research may be
perceived as necessitating greater time and other resources. There
are several advantages of this method, however, that justify its use.
First, IT managers adopt researchers’ objectivity and
consistency and this reduces the conflict that can arise from the
disparate views of the various stakeholders who are interpreting
actions and outcomes from different perspectives. That objectivity
and consistency also helps conserve the conceptual artifacts that IT
planners seek to improve.
Second, students, teachers, and school administrators live
and work in a dynamic and evolving environment in which
outcomes have multiple causes and an action may have multiple
effects. By collecting evidence from multiple sources, IT managers
are more likely to understand the interventions as they were
experienced by the community. Also, interventions that are
developed through iterative processes are more likely to reflect
theory. Theory tends to change more slowly than the methods that
gain popularity only to be replaced when the next fad gains
popularity. Theory-based evidence tends provide a more stable and
sustained foundation for interventions that improve how conceptual
artifacts are instantiated.
Third, education and technology are domains in which
individuals can have seemingly sophisticated experiences, but these
methods tend to minimize the threats posed by novices believing
they are experts. Many educators have purchased a wireless router,
to set up a home network. This can lead them to assume they have
expertise in enterprise networking. Technologists are also prone to
believe that the years they spent in school give them expert
knowledge of teaching and learning. The clear language and diverse
perspectives introduced to IT management adopting research
methods preserves the complexity of each field while facilitating
common understanding.
Fourth, by evaluating and reflecting on the design process
as well as the quality of the interventions, IT managers make sense
of the interventions they created and can account for their
observations. Those conclusions improve their own ability to design
similar interventions, contribute to growing institutional knowledge
of how the interventions are instantiated in the community, and can
173

Efficacious Educational Technology

support generalizations that can be used by other researchers and by
other managers.

174

CHAPTER 8: UNDERSTANDING CHANGE

The arc of the book has taken us from reasons technology
must play a new and unfamiliar role in education through the
components of a technology-rich school to the methods
whereby IT managers envision, design and deploy, and
improve IT systems in schools. Implicit in all of this work is
change; IT managers seek to change the tools students and
teachers use, the purposes for which they use them, and the
manner in which they are managed. In this final chapter, I
present ideas about change, and how leaders can manage
and promote change within schools.

The literature surrounding organizational change often uses
the terms “change” and “innovation” interchangeably. When
organizations deploy innovations, the leaders and members adopt
new tools, follow new procedures, and are driven to meet new
purposes. Scholars and practitioners in the field also recognize
change can affect different levels within the organization. Change
can be address limited parts of the organizational or the entire
system, and it can address small changes or wide-spread changes.
The strategies used to implement change depend on the nature of the
change leaders seek to make. There are several types of change that
leaders recognize:
• Procedural change seeks to improve the efficiency of the
methods whereby a logistic goal is improved. These are
often undertaken in isolation as the inputs into the
subsystem responsible for the logistic goal and the outputs
from it are unchanged.
• Systemic change seeks to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of many procedures at one time. Rather that
addressing procedural change as isolated activities,
systemic change considers the complex of procedures and

Efficacious Educational Technology

especially the interactions between procedures as the
important units of change.
• Transitional change is recognized as that change which is
designed to accomplish new goals. Whereas the same
strategic and logistic goals can motivate and drive
procedural and systemic changes, transitional change find
the procedures and systems changed so that new strategic
goals are achieved.
One of the challenges facing leaders who seek to implement
changes, especially those that are transitional, is their disruptive
nature. Successful organizations have defined structures and
procedures and developed culture to meet specific purposes with
efficiency and effectiveness. When the purpose of the organization
changes, or the previous purposes become obsolete, there is conflict
between the previous norms and those needed for the future. Clayton
Christensen (1997) observed disruptive changes are those in which
qualitatively different goals are defined for the organization, and
disruptive change requires structures that are contrary to those that
have been effective, and those that have the greatest effects on the
structural, human resource, political, and symbolic frames of the
organization.
The nature of the change in organizations that efficacious
IT managers deem necessary will depend in large part on the
existing circumstances and leaders’ and members’ interpretation of
those circumstances. It is anticipated that much of the change
suggested in this book will be transitional, especially that in which
the Standard Model of educations in overturned. Educators, like all
professionals, comprise individuals who are comfortable with
change and those who are not comfortable with change. Resisting
efforts to change the Standard Model of education and a marginal
role for technology are going to be increasingly untenable position
for educators. The decisions IT managers make will continue to be
a force directing this change.
In their 2010 book Change, Chip Heath and Dan Heath,
scholars and business leader who study change, attributed resistance
to change to three factors. These are observed regardless of the type
of change. First, until new practices become habit, people must exert
self-control to adopt them; this self-control is necessary to continue
using the new practices and avoid reverting to the previous
176

Efficacious Educational Technology

practices. Self-control requires effort, so it is in limited supply.
When self-control is exhausted, people return to previous practices.
Second, the greatest motivation for change arises when
individuals find an emotional connection to the purpose. The Heaths
suggest change arises inside an organization when members become
aware of a situation and there is a collective realization that existing
practices are contrary to the organization’s goals and fixing the
problems will result in important changes in the operation or
outcomes of the organization.
Third, change can be difficult when the purpose is unclear.
They suggest, “what looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity”
(Heath & Heath, 2010, p. 17). For Heath and Heath, the path to
change is grounded in clarifying the purpose, providing motivation,
and creating pathways where by motivation is sustained and action
becomes habit and the purpose is achieved.
For IT managers in schools who seek to implement change,
Heath and Heath’s propose a model of purpose, clarity, and pathway
can be complicated by the nature of education and the nature of
motivation. For most of the 20th century, leaders assumed
individuals within organizations were motivated by pay and other
rewards (increasing these were though to increase compliance with
new practices) and they were motivated to avoid punishments.
While educators are likely to comply with the changes in practice
they are directed to make, they are unlikely to internalize the needs
and they will revert to previous practices when possible.
In his 2009 book Drive, Daniel Pink provided evidence that
individuals are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose, so
change that is sustained must be based in actions that leverage these
aspects of individuals’ work. For Pink, autonomy is largely
grounded in self-direction; those who perceive they are able to exert
control over how they accomplish their goals are more intrinsically
motivated than those who have less control. Mastery is the ability of
individuals to improve their abilities in a meaningful way and for a
meaningful purpose.
Autonomy is a complicated factor in many organizations
and professions, including education. While autonomy is a factor
that motivates individuals to engage with and adopt innovations,
there is evidence that teachers may exert limited autonomy with
regards to regarding instructional practices (Range, Pijanowski,
Duncan, Scherz, & Hvidston, 2014). Blumenfeld, Kempler, and
Krajcik (2006) suggested autonomy is grounded in authority to
177

Efficacious Educational Technology

make decisions and the competence to identify and affect a solution.
In many cases, teachers lack the authority to be autonomous and the
technology that is the focus of the innovation is unfamiliar and
outside their perceived are of expertise.
Further, many teachers have deep personal and emotional
commitment to their own education and the practices that marked
their entry into the profession and their own teaching. Their
understanding of purpose is grounded in these experiences, so
teachers who have autonomy may reject the vision and purpose and
pathways to change even if they are clearly and reasonably
explained. Most math teachers, for example, became math teachers
because they found meaning and value in their own math education;
they will resist attempts to change the experience of teaching and
learning math. The result is a paradox on autonomy; efficacious IT
managers need to increase autonomy for teachers to adopt
innovative technology and technology-rich pedagogy, but teachers
are not used to having autonomy and those who do have it may reject
the innovation and seek to subvert it.
(While writing this book, I had a conversation with the
manager of a manufacturing facility who indicated workers were no
longer allowed to perform their own calculations when configuring
machines on the factory floor. Several mistakes had been made, and
the company had lost tens of thousands of dollars to resolve each
one, so the top-level managers decided that calculations were to be
done by engineers using calculators or other simulations of the
machines and they tell the operators how to adjust the machines.
Math teachers are horrified to hear this story, but the more insightful
and forward-thinking take it as motivation to reconsider what they
teach and how they teach it. Those are in the minority of teachers
who hear this story.)
Whitworth and Benson (2016) suggested three responses by
individuals when they perceive a difference between the purposes
of the organization and structures of that are deployed. They may
accommodate the change and adopt the changes and adapt what they
do to reflect the changes. They may relax the definitions (thus
creating broader conceptual artifacts) and implement innovations
that are nominally different, but that only partially change what they
do. Individuals may also subvert change by opposing them or
reverting to previously used tools and procedures.
It appears the task of leading change in education is
challenging. A leader can expect to encounter disparate and
178

Efficacious Educational Technology

contradictory perceptions of the purpose of school which will lead
to disparate and contradictory motivation to engage in the activities
necessary to change. Directing educators to adopt new practices or
adapt to new practices may result in compliance, but that is contrary
to the agency and autonomy the has been shown to result in change
in activity.
Educational leaders, including efficacious IT managers,
who seek to affect change, can ground their efforts in existing theory
related to innovation and change. Leaders who understand
organization frames and the nature of innovations and how they are
adopted in organizations or communities are more likely to generate
changes in practice that are sustained in the schools they lead.

Organizational Frames
Schools, of course, are social organizations; they comprise
multiple and diverse individuals who, ostensibly, are working to
achieve the same strategic goals through the same logistic goals. The
term “ostensibly” is appropriate when describing organizations as
they tend to be filled with individuals who different perspectives on
the purpose and the work of the organization. Bolman and Deal
(2008) are explicit about the difficulty of managing organizations,
The world of most managers and administrators
is a world of messes: complexity, ambiguity,
value dilemmas, political pressures, and multiple
consistencies. For managers whose images blind
them to important parts of the chaotic reality, it is
a world of frustration and failure (p. 41).
Bolman and Deal propose four organizational frames to
help managers deconstruct what is happening in their organizations
and then predict and explain the degree to which innovations or
changes are accepted and sustained as well as the reasons they are
accepted or rejected. Barriers to innovation, they claim, tend to arise
within one of these frames and how a manager responds depends on
which of these frames may be problematic. The nature of leadership
that is necessary to promote acceptable and sustained innovation and
change depends in large part on the frame within which the leader
seeks to exert influence. By addressing potential problems, building
capacity to address them, and increasing awareness of the problems
179

Efficacious Educational Technology

and solutions within each frame, organizational leaders have a
greater chance of being efficacious leaders than those who ignore
these frames.

Structural Frame
Organizations exist to accomplish goals; the book is
grounded in the assumption that schools exist to ensure students
participate in the communication and information landscape that
dominates their society so they have experience to continue that
participation when they leave the school. (Remember I am a
follower of John Dewey, so I believe “education is not preparation
for life; education is life itself.”)
Within the structural framework leaders seek to implement
new structures with innovations; implicit in an innovation is the
perception by members of the organization that structures are
different from those that characterized their work previously.
Innovations may increase efficiency, often after a period of
decreased efficiency as the innovation becomes habit. Other
innovations are designed to improve performance by more closely
aligning the outcomes with the desired outcomes. In some instances,
improved performance means accomplishing goals and engaging in
activities that were not previously recognized as goals of the
organization.
Strategic goals are achieved by achieving logistic goals.
Logistic goals, and the strategic goals they support, are achieved
through the tools, methods, and procedures that comprise the
structural frame including:
• methods for dividing labor (efficacious educational
technology depends on different expertise to decide what is
appropriate, proper and reasonable);
• controlling activities within groups assigned a responsibility
and coordinating between different groups to connect the
divisions of labor;
• establishing hierarchy (different individuals should be
allowed to override the others when designing educational
technology).

180

Efficacious Educational Technology

Especially in large and diverse organizations in which the
logistic goals are only achieved by individuals who have greater
expertise than others in the organizations, the division of labor and
responsibility is more marked than it is in other organizations.
Efficacious IT management is clearly an example of such a
situation, so it is helpful for leaders to further deconstruct the
structural frame in to components following Mintzberg’s (1979)
typology:
• Operating core which includes those individuals and
structures that directly lead to the strategic goal; teachers
are the primary personnel in the structural frame in schools
and the materials they use are the primary resources in the
operating core of schools.
• Administrative component which includes those personnel
whose role is to manage the operating core and structures
they use. In schools, principals and other instructional
leaders along with (for example) the system they use to
evaluate teachers are among to structures that comprise this
component.
• Techncostructures includes those components of the
structural frame that ensure the system is efficient and
effective. In educational technology, this would include the
technicians and network administrators along with CIO’s
who maintain the IT infrastructure.
• Support systems include those components of the structures
designed to facilitate others’ work. The assistant who
processes purchase orders for computer hardware is an
example of the support systems that comprise the structural
frame for educational technology.
Improvements of the structural frame within each component
lead to greater efficiency of its operation and the greater alignment
with the its effectiveness in achieving those logistic goals that fall
under the leadership and control of those with that expertise. In
general, when innovations affect the operation of one single
component, those leaders and members have greater autonomy in
making decisions and deploying innovations.
181

Efficacious Educational Technology

When decisions and innovations affect more than one
component, coordination becomes more important to ensure the
innovation is effective from multiple perspectives. Coordination
depends in large part on effective horizontal communication.
Efficacious IT management in schools depends on the participation
of leaders from disparate groups, and they have a role in ensuring
members of their organizations understand the rationale for the
decision, and members have a responsibility for facilitating
horizontal communication of structures within their domain to
others.
Consider IT managers who are implementing a new
ticketing system to report and track malfunctioning devices. The IT
professionals must ensure teachers and school leaders understand
the importance of using it (a message that must come from all
leaders in the school) and they must ensure the system is easy to use
and known to all. It is only in this way that the techncostructure of
the ticketing system can help the IT professionals support the
operating core of the organization. Consider, also, the configuration
of the student information system. How performance is recorded
and scores and grades are calculated depends on the SIS being
configured so that it reflects the grading policy of the school. This
requires coordination between those with different types of
expertise and different responsibilities to ensure the intended
outcome is realized.
Within the structural frame, procedural changes are
common as those within a division of labor attempt to improve their
efficiency and effectiveness. These changes are most likely to be
accepted and adopted when there is clear alignment between the
changes, the logistic goal, and the strategic goals of the organization.
For many leaders, this becomes an exercise in backwards design
(see figure 8.1). This finds managers defining the logistic goals in
collaboration with disparate leaders. In a manner aligned with
progressive discourse (Bereiter, 2002), they define both the
language of the goal and the observations that will confirm the goal
has been met. Within the component of the structural frame, experts
will design and improve structures to increase efficiency and
effectiveness.

182

Efficacious Educational Technology

Figure 8.1 Backwards design
Teachers and other school professionals recognize that
leaders who are newly hired in schools or central offices often seek
to change practices for reasons unrelated to the efficient and
effective operation of the structural frame. Consider the school
principal who seeks to implement new procedures that have been
effective in other schools where she was the principal. While
making the changes may improve performance from her perspective
or they may make the structure more familiar to her, they may be
resisted by teachers and they may result in less effective school
operation than the existing procedures.
For technology-rich organizations, understanding change
within the structural frame necessitates leaders and members
differentiate that change needed to keep current and that change
needed for procedural or transformative changes. Technology
evolves. To ensure the information ones creates is compatible with
that created by others and to ensure IT systems are compatible, they
are updated and upgraded. Some of these changes may necessitate
procedures and tools be updated simply to maintain the current level
of functionality. While these may lead to more efficient use of IT
resources, they generally are not perceived to be improvements in
the structural frame by leaders or members of organizations.

Human Resource Frame
All actions taken by leaders, and especially those in which
they attempt to innovate, have implications for the people who work
within the organization. Organizations that are most successful at
implementing procedural and transitional changes have employees
183

Efficacious Educational Technology

and members who are fully engaged with the work. They both
implement existing procedures as designed and they identify and
they communicate methods whereby procedures can be improved;
they approach transitional change in the same manner. They connect
the purpose to the innovation and improve the pathways between
the innovations and the new purpose. The human resource frame
addresses those aspects of the organization that affect members’
motivation to participate in the changes.
Generations of managers have assumed that individuals
would work for pay (or other rewards) or to avoid punishments.
While those do work to a limited degree, scholars are beginning to
understand the importance of other aspects of work and personality
that more accurately predict and explain participation and
engagement in change efforts. Efficacious IT managers (and other
leaders) now understand the importance of promoting innovations
by motivating members and developing human resources in a more
complete manner. Bolman and Deal (2008) identified several
strategies for fully developing the human resource frame; some of
these can be done with the existing human resources while others
necessitate changes in staffing.
Management can affect human resources by changing their
expectations of members and changing how and why management
interacts with members. Examples of these strategies include
redesigning structures to align with goals they value and to seek and
accept members’ feedback in refining structures to improve
efficiency. Decisions and actions that members perceive to be the
managers supporting their development as competent and
contributing members of the organization can improve the human
resources frame of organizations. These strategies do include some
of the traditional factors thought to motivate, such as promoting
from within the organization and increasing salaries. In most
educational institutions, many compensation structures are
established by negotiated contracts with unions, and many
advancement opportunities require additional licenses. Further,
teachers who assume leadership roles often find they have less time
for their regular duties, so they are less motivated by these strategies
than members of other organizations.
Managers can also improve the performance of the human
resources frame by articulating a clear vision around supporting
employees as valued contributors to the organization. In some cases,
the human resources frame can only be improved by changing the
184

Efficacious Educational Technology

individuals who work in the organization. This is especially true
when disruptive changes are underway, and the organization cannot
continue with those who reject the new purpose of the organization
or those who do not have the knowledge, skill, or propensity to
adopt and adapt to essential innovations. This is described as
adopting a philosophy towards human resources, but in many ways
the vision of human resources frame has symbolic implications.
This vision also informs hiring decisions, and managers improved
the human resources frame by hiring individuals with the personal
qualities that are amenable to adopting and accepting change and
innovation. One important aspect of hiring IT professionals is also
ensuring there is a match between the technology skills of the
individual and the expectations of the job.
Argyris and Schön (1996) suggested leaders who adopt a
stance towards communication that combines advocacy and inquiry
are perceived as effective in implementing change while respecting
important aspects of human resources. Through advocacy, leaders
attempt to implement change and they are either assertive or passive.
Through inquiry, leaders seek to understand others’ perspectives on
situations. In this model, the leaders who are most effective seek to
be integrative, both understanding and assertive; they implement
change while accommodating others to the extent possible.
When adopting an integrative stance, leaders do find a role
for both the formal and informal participation of the members of the
organization in decision-making. This requires leaders to provide
sufficient structure that the process does not become a “turf-war” or
that irrelevant factors affect decisions. It also requires the leader
provide a sufficiently clear goal. When defining goals and
processes, however, leaders can become imposing which threatens
the participation that is necessary to improve the human resource
frame of organizational innovation.

Political Frame
All human organizations are political; they comprise
individuals and groups who are largely motivated by self-interest as
they advocate the organization support a particular set of decisions
and actions. Self-interest is grounded in the different values and
beliefs held by individuals as well as different interpretations of
information which are affected by those beliefs and values. Political
advocacy is necessary as organizations have limited resources, so
there are debates and negotiations that influence decision-making
185

Efficacious Educational Technology

about which problems will be solved and which aspects of the
structural frame will be improved. This is the situation from which
the political frame of organizations innovation arises.
Implicit in the political frame is power and partisanship.
Some individuals and the groups to which they belong have greater
influence and authority to make decisions than others and partisans
are those with lesser power who support the recommendation of
others. These, of course, are dynamic characteristics within
organizations; individuals or groups can gain or lose power
depending on changes in how partisans align their support and other
factors including changes in governance. Differences in political
power are also consistent with many decision-making processes
especially in IT, which finds those who use the systems (and who
must find them efficient and effective) and those with expertise in
building the systems are different.
Power does arise from various sources including the
position one holds; in schools, the superintendent typically has the
greatest authority and reports to the publically elected officials who
govern the school. Efficacious IT managers will likely find it
necessary to defer to the superintendent as the arbiter of political
disputes. These leaders also tend to derive power from the ability to
control which decisions are made, how the problems are framed, and
what solutions are deemed acceptable. In addition to the
superintendent, other school leaders derive political power from
their offices, but power derived form position tends to be the most
tenuous.
Expertise and the capacity to solve the problems faced by
the organization (and that are deemed important and unsolved by
leaders) is another source of power. Increasingly expertise is
determined by the nature and extent of one’s professional network
as it is a source of strategies and approaches to problems that one
has yet to encounter. Reputation is largely grounded in one’s
expertise and the extent to which others are aware of one’s expertise;
this awareness is also extended through a wide network.
All leaders and members, including those who hold political
power through their office, can extend and expand their political
power by negotiating coalitions. An individual who holds expertise
that is needed by others gains power and can enter into partisan
relationships with others, thus those who are politically less
powerful can gain power by forming their relationships. Astute
political leaders will attempt to form partisanship alliances with
186

Efficacious Educational Technology

individuals whose sources of power complete those of the leader.
Because of the benefits one can gain, the ability to negotiate these
partisan relationships is a source of political power that can be
improved.
Leaders who seek to promote organizational innovation
improve capacity within the political frame by encouraging large
coalitions of individuals and group who both support and participate
in implementing the changes beyond compliance. Referring to those
within organizations who are less powerful due to position, Bolman
and Deal (2008) observed, “They accept direction better when they
perceive the people in authority to be credible, competent, and
sensible” (p. 219). Leaders who have engaged members are more
likely to receive accurate and complete feedback from members
who are more autonomous.
Political conflict can be a barrier to innovation and even
destructive to many aspects of organizations, especially the human
resources frame. Efficacious leaders, including IT managers in
schools, will recognize the political frame of decision-making, and
they will negotiate to leverage collaboration among the stakeholders
so that leaders access more complete expertise and those with
valuable expertise gain political power. Effective political leaders
also develop their own expertise so they are in a better position to
evaluate their own expertise and to understand the recommendations
of others.

Symbolic Frame
Actions, events, and situations can all have meaning for
individuals. In organizations, these meanings determine in large part
the emotional and intellectual connections members make to the
organization and its purposes and goals. These contribute in an
important way to the motivation of members to participate in
innovative change. Leaders can develop the symbolic frame to
affect how members connect to and identify with the organization,
and the extent to which they value and contribute to improving
efficiency and efficiency, as well as the collations to which they
belong.
The symbolic frame is grounded in the themes that people
use to organize ambiguous and unclear situations. Culture and its
components such as faith, myths, values, and rituals, all contribute
to how the symbolic frame is instantiated. Efficacious leaders who
seek to affect the symbolic frame will often craft myths and stories
187

Efficacious Educational Technology

to describe their organizations or their vision for what the
organization will become. In many cases these begin as myths, and
the organization in fact does not reflect the myth. Over time, as
innovations in the structural, human resource, and political frames
become aligned with the symbolic vison of the leaders, the vision
becomes realized.
A common criticism of leaders who focus on the symbolic
frame is that they are “all talk, but no action,” as the symbolic frame
is often communicated in grand-sounding, but nebulous, terms. The
translation of symbolic language into a clear vision and path is
accomplished by defining individuals and the actions of individuals
who represent the symbol. This embodiment of the symbols can
both demonstrate to members that the vision contained in the
symbol is possible and the members can identify with the actions.
This allows members to identify a connection to the goals of the
innovation which Heath and Heath (2010) observe provides the
motivation for change.

Innovations
Everett Rogers’ seminal work the Diffusion of Innovations
(2003) first appeared in 1962, and he produced multiple versions
and editions in the following decades. Throughout the history of the
work Rogers sought to understand how innovations (new ways of
action or new tools) are communicated (through various channels)
over time to the members of a social system. Rogers found the
similarities in the characteristics of adopters and in the factors
describing the diffusion in a wide range of organizations, industries,
and cultures. Scholars continue to use diffusion of innovation as a
model for framing data collection and interpreting results. His
observations and theory provides several useful frameworks for
efficacious IT managers in schools.

The Nature of Innovations
According to Rogers, the rate at which an innovation is
adopted by a group is affected by four factors. First, the users must
become aware of the innovation and perceive the ideas, tools, or
practices as different from those currently in use. In the world
dominated by rapid advances in information and other technology,
it is easy to assume innovations must be based on things that did not
exist previously. Rogers confirms anything that is unfamiliar can be
188

Efficacious Educational Technology

an innovation. How an innovation is perceived is determined by its
relative advantage, compatibility with existing practices,
complexity, and demonstrability. In general, innovations that
diffuse are those that help one improve performance in a meaningful
and efficient way, that are easy to use, and that users can try on a
limited basis and the results can be shared with others.
Many educators are familiar with seeming cyclic nature of
educational reforms and pedagogies advocates claim are innovative.
This can lead cynical curmudgeonly teachers—a group which
occasionally includes the author when faced with leaders whose
credibility, competent, and sensibility is dubious—to remind others
“we used to do this years ago.”
Second, diffusion of innovation requires communication,
and that communication can occur through various types of
channels. Mass media, a channel marked by a single person or group
communicating the same message to a large audience, and it can be
an effective method for introducing innovations to a community.
Increasingly, social media and professional learning networks that
are maintained and cultivated with digital tools are replacing mass
media as a method of communicating innovations. This is one
reason those with greater networks have greater political power in
organizations that seek to be innovative. The diffusion of innovation
typically involves interpersonal communication between dyads or
small groups within the social system.
Third, innovations occur within a social system or
community comprising members who seek to accomplish a
particular goal. Some innovations are designed to accomplish
essential aspects of the social system; these can be implemented by
authoritarian fit. Others are designed to affect optional aspects of the
social system, and these are adopted largely though social
influences. Within the social system, there will be leaders whose
opinions and perceptions matter to others and there are various types
of decisions that are made. Venktash et al. (2003) noted social
influences are a factor directly associated with the decision to use
technology, thus individuals perceived to be influential are of
particular important when leaders seek to diffuse technological
innovations. Social systems, we know, comprise structural, human
resource, political, and symbolic frames, and how an innovation
affects each frame contributes to rate it diffuses and the extent to
which it diffuses.

189

Efficacious Educational Technology

Fourth, the diffusion of innovations is characterized by
time. The rate at which individuals within the social system adopt
an innovation defines four groups that are considered in the next
section. The time necessary for an individual to adopt an innovation
depends on the delays between learning of an innovation until the
decision is made to adopt it and then to actually implement it. In
some situations, individuals may be locked-in to other methods
because of investments in time, money, or other resources; or for
political or symbolic reasons.
Rogers and others have observed that some innovations are
discontinued after they enter a social system. Reasons for
discontinuation vary, but replacement by another innovation is
common; innovation researchers recognize that an innovative tool,
practice, or idea will become traditional practices, which is later
replaced by a different innovation. (In education, these innovations
often return after a generation of disuse. My grandfather and I used
to talk about innovative new science teaching methods that I was
using. We found many similarities between those he adopted during
his career in the classroom and those I was adopting. We both were
active in our professions and had spent summers attending
workshops to learn “the innovative new teaching methods.”)
Users may discontinue using an innovation when they
become disenchanted with it, especially when they do not produce
the outcomes promised by advocates. Cuban (1986) noted this was
a reason teachers discontinued to use radio, television, and movies
as they emerged in the 20th century. Disenchantment can also rise
when innovations prove to be unsafe or when other unforeseen and
unintended consequences threaten the effectiveness of the
innovation.

Stages of Adoption
Once an innovation enters a community, and begins to
diffuse, its adoption occurs as the populations accepts it, and this
can be explained in a very predictable way. A small number of
individuals are responsible for introducing the innovation and those
that prove more efficacious, effective, and efficient tend to diffuse
through organizations through five different stages. The
characteristics of those who adopt an innovation at each stage have
also been documented by Roger and others. Two types of lines are
used to describe and quantify the diffusion of an innovation, a bell
curve illustrates the number of individuals who are in each of five
190

Efficacious Educational Technology

stages of adoption and an s-curve is used to illustrate the part of the
population that has adopted the innovation (see figure 8.2).

Figure 8.2: Stages of innovation illustrated.
Innovators comprise the first 2.5% of the population of the
social system to begin using a new tool or practice or to accept an
idea. Individuals in this group tend to be widely connected to others
outside the social system or community, thus have greater exposure
to new ideas and tools; in the digital world, innovators may be
widely dispersed and use digital tools and social networks to
maintain their networks. In addition, these individuals tend to have
resources that can be dedicated to experimentation with innovations
and the individuals are open to taking the risks associated with
adopting ineffective or inefficient innovations that do not gain
acceptance. This group is illustrated on the far left of figure 8.2.
Early adopters are the next 13.5% of the population to adopt
an innovation. Whereas innovators tend to be highly connected
outside of an organization or population (thus they are the conduits
for an innovation to enter it), early adopters are more highly
connected and respected within the organization or population.
Innovators seek to identify those who are likely to be early adopters,
as those innovations accepted by this group are likely to diffuse
more quickly because these individuals exert significant social
pressure on others. In addition to vetting the changes introduced by
innovators, early adopters become change agents as they become a
191

Efficacious Educational Technology

model for others to follow and they demonstrate the applicability of
an innovation.
Members of the early majority are the first adopters that are
considered followers as they are the first to follow the example of
the early adopters. Rogers quotes Alexander Pope who wrote in
1711, “Be not the first by whom the new is tried, nor the last to lay
the old aside” to describe this type of user. All adopters proceed
from awareness of the innovation through knowledge of the
innovation to the decision to adopt it. The early majority tends to
take longer than earlier adopters to become aware of an innovation,
but once they have knowledge of it from credible early adopters,
they tend to make the decision to adopt the innovation.
The second half of the users to adopt an innovation is
divided into two groups. For statistical reasons, the late majority
comprises 34% of the users and the final 16% of the adopters are the
late adopters. Once the majority of the population is using an
innovation, the late majority adopters yield to increasing
expectations that the innovation be used. They also cite practical
reasons, including economic factors and decreasing access to
traditional tools, when making the decision to adopt an innovation.
In many cases, these users adopt an innovation only after the
remaining uncertainties over the effectiveness and acceptance of an
innovation are removed.
Rogers and others have used the term laggards to describe
the later adopters. This group tends to retain the traditional tools,
practices, and ideas until all other options have been removed.
While this group tends to be relatively closed, tending to
communicate with others in the group who are later adopters also,
the reasons for the later adoption of innovation be this group derive
from any factors. Rogers does recognize the tendency in many
organizations to blame the individuals who are the last to adopt an
innovation, but he criticizes that approach as important factors
related to the organization can be understood by studying the
rationale given by later adopters for their delay.
Leaders who seek to sustain innovations within their
organizations should analyze later adopters and their rationale for
not adopting earlier as this can indicate system-wide problems with
structure, communication, or implementation that should be
resolved. Bolman and Deans’ (2008) structural, human, resources,
political and symbolic frames can provide a framework for
understand these adoption decisions. In some cases, it is the
192

Efficacious Educational Technology

characteristics of the individuals which led to laggardly adoptions,
but in many cases, there are other factors (especially those beyond
the control of the later adopters) that affected their knowledge,
decisions, or ability to implement an innovation. Understanding
these will both help sustain innovations and allow the leaders to
more quickly diffuse other innovations.

Innovations within Organization
The diffusion of innovations has been studied in both formal
and informal populations. Among the examples that Rogers used
often in his books were farmers. Innovations in farming practice
tend to diffuse through social systems of farmers who grow similar
crops in similar environments, and adoption rates are affected by
many both market factors and production factors as well as the
degree to which one is locked in. A farmer who has recently
purchased a machine that is aligned with a traditional practice is
unlikely to discard it for an innovative practice until the new
machine has generated sufficient income. Likewise, a school that
had purchased a new student information system and has migrated
data to it and trained users in using it are unlikely to abandon it for
an innovative new system until very compelling reasons are
obvious.
Organizations are characterized by specific purposes and it
achieves its purpose through specific role that are assigned to
members, organizational and authoritarian structures, and both
formal and informal rules and practices. As described in the
previous section, organizations can be deconstructed into four
frames which affect how they accomplish their goals and how it
responds to change.
Rogers defined organizational innovativeness in terms of
the speed at which an innovation diffuses through an organization.
The faster the adoption rate, the more innovative the organization.
He also found eight factors that affect organizations innovativeness;
six are positively associated and two are inversely associated.
Given that autonomy is known to be a factor continuing to
member’s motivation and participation to adopt innovation, it is
unsurprising to learn Rogers finds centralize management and high
levels of formalized processes to be negatively associated with the
adoption of innovations within organizations. In addition to being
an obstacle to the entry of innovations into an organization,
centralized management and formalized processes slow adoption as
193

Efficacious Educational Technology

the single entities responsible for approving changes become a
bottleneck where the diffusion of innovations slow.
It is perhaps not surprising that leaders’ attitudes towards
change is positively associated with organizations innovation.
Those leaders who are more accepting of innovations are more
likely to both seek out innovations, become an active advocate for
them, and make decisions and delegate authority in a manner that
that contributes to the more rapid diffusion of innovations within the
organization. Further, members of the organization who have a
positive attitude towards change will find fewer reasons to avoid
innovations, thus they quickly adopt them which increases
organizational innovativeness. Hiring such individuals (and
providing mentors to those who are not) becomes a human resources
strategy that can increase the diffusion of innovations.
Interconnectedness and openness are variations on the same
characteristic; each determines the availability and use of channels
of communication. Organizations with connections to the outside
are open and those with deep interpersonal connections within the
organization are interconnected. Both of these contribute to the
communication that is essential to the diffusion of innovations as
they are more likely to enter an open organization and diffuse
through an interconnected one.
Slack is a measure of the resources within an organization
that are not committed to other purposes. Financial, personnel, and
other resources that can be used to support innovation, thus
increasing the capacity for diffusion of innovations and the
development of expertise.
Complexity is in interesting factor. Organizations
comprising individuals with greater expertise and knowledge in
their area tend to be more complex, and innovations tend to enter
those organizations through those individuals. In general, greater
complexity is associated with greater organizational innovation.
Size is also an interesting factor associated with organizations
innovativeness. Larger and more complex organizations tend to
have greater formalized procedures and centralized structures which
decrease innovation. Despite this, Rogers found larger organizations
to be more innovative, others (for example Laforet, 2016) have
found small organizations to be more innovative.
Even in those organizations in which the characteristics
positively associated with the diffusion of innovations are observed,
leaders tend to follow a consistent procedure when selecting those
194

Efficacious Educational Technology

innovations to pursue and implementing innovations, and five
processes characterize this work:
• Agenda-setting;
• Matching;
• Restructuring;
• Clarifying;
• Routinizing.
As listed, these represent the chronological order in which
innovations diffusion through organizational practice, but in the
most innovative organizations, these processes tend to be blurred
and the progression is not always linear.
Agenda-setting is the process of identifying a problem
within and organization and determining that it is going to receive
the attention of leaders and a solution will be designed and
implemented. Because organizations have a purpose which is
embodied in the strategic goal, the problems that are solved through
innovation are directly related to the degree to which the purpose of
met (or not met). Problems typically emerge from the organization’s
purpose and may be defined so the organization gains competitive
advantage, addresses an unmet need among clients, or otherwise
expands its reach or improves its performance. Implicit in the
agenda setting is that some aspect of the organization will be
changed. In most organizations, agenda-setting occurs within the
political frame, and only those situations recognized by the most
powerful leaders receive the attention or members or the financial
resources of the organization.
Matching is undertaken to ensure the innovation meets the
needs of the organization. In some cases, new ideas or new tools are
produced by manufacturers or publishers and incorporating those
into the organization becomes a priority, despite the fact the need
did not exist before the innovation was produced by others. Mobile
phones are the quintessential example; until they were invented and
became used by a critical mass of individuals, the devices did not
focus innovation. Now, mobile devices have led to many
innovations in products, processes, and services. Innovators, the
first 2.5 % of a population to adopt it, play an important role in
finding and introducing innovations to organizations and finding
those that may match problems identified in agenda setting.

195

Efficacious Educational Technology

Restructuring is the process whereby the innovation is
customized to fit the needs and the existing structures (and human
resources, politics, and symbolism) of the organization. In some
instances, this requires modifying the innovation so the tool,
practice, or idea more closely aligns with the existing organization;
and in other instances, it requires the organization adapt to reflect
the capacity of the innovation. Through either approach,
restructuring assures a match between the innovation and the
operation of the organization.
No matter how careful and attentive the restructuring
process is, there will be gaps the in the implementation of the
innovation. Anticipated improvements will not be realized and
unexpected consequences will emerge, so leaders will support the
clarification of innovation, and this also includes both adapting the
organization to the innovation and adapting the innovation to the
organization.
Once innovations are tuned to the needs and structures of
the organization, they become a part of the routine. Once completely
routinized, innovations are no longer innovations and they become
the traditional practice and tools that are replaced by new
innovations.

CONCLUSION

We are working at a moment in history when education is
changing. For more than one generation into the 21st century, adults
have been trying to figure out how to create schools that reflect the
changing society and culture. For those generations, adults have
spoken of the need to create “21st century schools.” (I have a former
colleague who would recoil every time she heard that phrase. “It’s
too late,” she would say, “its going be over before we stop talking
about building schools for it.”) These adults have been grounding
all of their recommendations in old and outdated assumptions about
teaching and learning and technology. Compounding the problems
that arise from this is the rate at which everything changes—what
we teach, how we teach, and the tools we have for teaching change
far more rapidly than they did for previous generations.
What has become clear to me in the time since I began my
career in the field, and even since I started drafting this book, is the
schools we need now, and that we will continue to need long after I
have retired are will be places where great expertise comes together
to create a place that cannot be created by any one individual. Our
future schools depend on:
Information technology that is always functioning and
available to all students and teachers.
Teaching and learning that is diverse and responsive to the
needs to teachers and learners and that prepares all for the
unpredictable future.
Decisions made that ensure these schools exist and that all
families can send their children to one of these schools.
