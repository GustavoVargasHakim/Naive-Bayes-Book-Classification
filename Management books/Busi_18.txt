Introduction

This textbook and its accompanying spreadsheet templates were designed with and for students wanting a
practical and easy-to-follow guide for developing a business plan. It follows a unique format that both explains
what to do and demonstrates how to do it.

Chapter 1 – Developing a Business Plan

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Describe the purposes for business planning
• Describe common business planning principles
• Explain common business plan development guidelines and tools
• List and explain the elements of the business plan development process
• Explain the purposes of each element of the business plan development process
• Explain how applying the business plan development process can aid in developing a business
plan that will meet entrepreneurs’ goals

Overview
This chapter describes the purposes, principles, and the general concepts and tools for business planning, and the
process for developing a business plan.

Purposes for Developing Business Plans
Business plans are developed for both internal and external purposes. Internally, entrepreneurs develop business
plans to help put the pieces of their business together. Externally, the most common purpose is to raise capital.
Internal Purposes
As the road map for a business’s development, the business plan
• Defines the vision for the company
• Establishes the company’s strategy

3 • LEE A. SWANSON

• Describes how the strategy will be implemented
• Provides a framework for analysis of key issues
• Provides a plan for the development of the business
• Helps the entrepreneur develop and measure critical success factors
• Helps the entrepreneur to be realistic and test theories
External Purposes
The business plan provides the most complete source of information for valuation of the business. Thus, it is
often the main method of describing a company to external audiences such as potential sources for financing and
key personnel being recruited. It should assist outside parties to understand the current status of the company, its
opportunities, and its needs for resources such as capital and personnel.

Business Plan Development Principles
Hindle and Mainprize (2006) suggested that business plan writers must strive to effectively communicate
their expectations about the nature of an uncertain future and to project credibility. The liabilities of newness
make communicating the expected future of new ventures much more difficult than for existing businesses.
Consequently, business plan writers should adhere to five specific communication principles.
First, business plans must be written to meet the expectations of targeted readers in terms of what they need to
know to support the proposed business. They should also lay out the milestones that investors or other targeted
readers need to know. Finally, writers must clearly outline the opportunity, the context within the proposed venture
will operate (internal and external environment), and the business model (Hindle & Mainprize, 2006).
There are also five business plan credibility principles that writers should consider. Business plan writers should
build and establish their credibility by highlighting important and relevant information about the venture team.
Writers need to elaborate on the plans they outline in their document so that targeted readers have the information
they need to assess the plan’s credibility. To build and establish credibility, they must integrate scenarios to show
that the entrepreneur has made realistic assumptions and has effectively anticipated what the future holds for
their proposed venture. Writers need to provide comprehensive and realistic financial links between all relevant
components of the plan. Finally, they must outline the deal, or the value that targeted readers should expect to
derive from their involvement with the venture (Hindle & Mainprize, 2006).

General Guidelines for Developing Business Plans
Many businesses must have a business plan to achieve their goals. Using a standard format helps the reader
understand that the you have thought everything through, and that the returns justify the risk. The following are
some basic guidelines for business plan development.

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 4

As You Write Your Business Plan
1. If appropriate, include nice, catchy, professional graphics on your title page to make it appealing to targeted
readers, but don’t go overboard.
2. Bind your document so readers can go through it easily without it falling apart. You might use a three-ring
binder, coil binding, or a similar method. Make sure the binding method you use does not obscure the information
next to where it is bound.
3. Make certain all of your pages are ordered and numbered correctly.
4. The usual business plan convention is to number all major sections and subsections within your plan using the
format as follows:
1. First main heading
1.1 First subheading under the first main heading
1.1.1. First sub-subheading under the first subheading
2. Second main heading
2.1 First subheading under the second main heading
Use the styles and references features in Word to automatically number and format your section titles and to
generate your table of contents. Be sure that the last thing you do before printing your document is update your
automatic numbering and automatically generated tables. If you fail to do this, your numbering may be incorrect.
5. Prior to submitting your plan, be 100% certain each of the following requirements are met:
• Everything must be completely integrated. The written part must say exactly the same thing as the
financial part.
• All financial statements must be completely linked and valid. Make sure all of your balance sheets
balance.
• Everything must be correct. There should be NO spelling, grammar, sentence structure, referencing, or
calculation errors.
• Your document must be well organized and formatted. The layout you choose should make the
document easy to read and comprehend. All of your diagrams, charts, statements, and other additions
should be easy to find and be located in the parts of the plan best suited to them.
• In some cases it can strengthen your business plan to show some information in both text and table or
figure formats. You should avoid unnecessary repetition, however, as it is usually unnecessary—and
even damaging—to state the same thing more than once.
• You should include all the information necessary for readers to understand everything in your

5 • LEE A. SWANSON

document.
• The terms you use in your plan should be clear and consistent. For example, the following statement in
a business plan would leave a reader completely confused:
“There is a shortage of 100,000 units with competitors currently producing 25,000. We can help fill
this huge gap in demand with our capacity to produce 5,000 units.”
This statement might mean there is a total shortage of 100,000 units, but competitors are filling this
gap by producing 25,000 per year; in which case there will only be a shortage for four years. However,
it could mean that the annual shortage is 100,000 units and only 25,000 are produced each year, in
which case the total shortage is very high and is growing each year.
• You must always provide the complete perspective by indicating the appropriate time frame, currency,
size, or other measurement.
• If you use a percentage figure, you must indicate to what it refers—otherwise the number is
meaningless to a reader.
• If your plan includes an international element, you must indicate in which currency or currencies the
costs, revenues, prices, or other values are quoted. This can be solved by indicating up-front in the
document in which currency all values will be quoted. Another option is to indicate each time which
currency is being used, and sometimes you might want to indicate the value in more than one currency.
Of course, you will need to assess the exchange rate risk to which you will be exposed and describe
this in your document.
6. Ensure credibility is both established and maintained (Hindle & Mainprize, 2006).
• If a statement presents something as a fact when this fact is not generally known, always indicate the
source. Unsupported statements damage credibility.
• Be specific. A business plan is simply not of value if it uses vague references to high demand,
carefully set prices, and other weak phrasing. It must show hard numbers (properly referenced, of
course), actual prices, and real data acquired through proper research. This is the only way to ensure
your plan is considered credible.
• Your strategies must be integrated. For example, your pricing strategy must complement and mesh
perfectly with your product/service strategy, distribution strategy, and promotions strategy. For
example, you probably shouldn’t promote your product as a premium product if you plan to charge
lower-than-market prices for it.
7. Before finalizing your business plan, re-read each section to evaluate whether it will appeal to your targeted
readers.

Business Plan Development Tools
Credibility and Communication
According to Hindle and Mainprize (2006), strong business plans effectively communicate the necessary
information to the targeted readers while also establishing the credibility of the plan and the entrepreneur. The
Credibility and Communication Meter icon is used throughout this book to highlight where and how business plan
writers can improve the quality of the information and enhance their and their plan’s credibility.

Credibility and Communication Meter

Use the following tools to improve the information in and credibility of your plans:
The Ratchet Effect
A ratchet is a tool that most of us are familiar with. It is useful because it helps its user accomplish something with
each effort expended while guarding against losing past advancements.
With each word, sentence, paragraph, heading, chart, figure, and table you include in your final business plan, the
ratchet should move ahead a notch because you achieve two important things.
First, only needed and relevant information is included.
Second, your additions build credibility in a relevant way.
Apply the ratchet effect by making sure that each and every sentence and paragraph conveys needed and relevant
information that adds to your and your plan’s credibility. Use the following principles:
Rarely—and only if it truly needs to be said again—repeat something that you have already said in your plan.

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 8

Avoid using killer phrases, like “there is no competition for our product” or “our product will sell itself, so we
will not need to advertise it.” Any savvy reader will understand that these kinds of statements are naive and
demonstrate a lack of understanding about how the market and other real-life factors actually work.
Avoid contradicting yourself. Make sure that what is said in the written part of your plan completely syncs with
what is said in the other parts of your plan. Likewise, ensure that what you include in the financial parts of your
plan is completely in sync with what is said the written part.
The Magic Formula
Apply the following magic formula throughout your write your plan.
(a)… consideration X affects my business because …
(b)… consideration X is subject to this trend into the future …
(c)… which means that we have decided to do this … (or) will implement this strategy … in response to how the
expected trends for consideration X will affect my business
Here is an example of how you can use the magic formula to develop part of the pricing strategy in the marketing
plan part of your business plan:
We expect that our expenses to run our business will rise with the rate of inflation, which means that we must plan
to increase the prices on our products to establish and maintain our profitability. The Bank of Canada (201x) has
projected that the general inflation rate in <the city in which my business will operate> will be 3.0% in 201x, 3.5%
in 201y, and 4.0% in 201z. In our projected financial statements, therefore, we have inflated both our expenses
and our prices by those rates in those years.
Context and Framing
You must provide the right context when you describe situations, strategies, and other components of your plan.
Business plan readers should never be left to guess why you indicate in a business plan that you will do something.
Proper context is needed to help you frame the information you present.
When you frame the stories you tell correctly, the ratchet effect will happen and your plan will be stronger. One
example of effective framing is when you, as the writer of the plan and the entrepreneur, clearly indicate how your
education, expertise, relevant experiences, and network of contacts will make up for any lack of direct experience
you have in running this particular kind of business. An example of ineffective framing is when you indicate that
you lack experience with this type of business, or when you fail to specify how and why your levels of experience
will affect the business’s development.
Prioritizing Problems
Don’t get hung up on something that doesn’t need an immediate solution. Instead, flag it for future consideration

9 • LEE A. SWANSON

and move on. When you return to re-address the issue, it might no longer be a problem or you might have by then
figured out a solution.

Process for Developing Business Plans
The business plan development process described next has been extensively tested with entrepreneurship students
and has proven to provide the guidance entrepreneurs need to develop a business plan appropriate for their needs:
a high power business plan.
Developing a high power business plan has six stages, which can be compared to a process for hosting a dinner for
a few friends. A host hoping to make a good impression with their anticipated guests might analyze the situation
at multiple levels to collect data on new alternatives for healthy ingredients, what ingredients have the best prices
and are most readily available at certain times of year, the new trends in party appetizers, what food allergies the
expected guests might have, possible party themes, and so on. This analysis is the Essential Initial Research stage.
In the Business Model stage, the host might construct a menu of items to include with the meal along with a list
of decorations to order, music to play, and costume themes to suggest to the guests. The mix of these kinds of
elements chosen by the host will aid in the success of the party.
The Initial Business Plan Draft stage is where the host rolls up their sleeves and begins to make some of the food
items, puts up some of the decorations, and generally gets everything started for the party.
During this stage, the host will begin to realize that some plans are not feasible and that changes are needed. The
required changes might be substantial, like the need to postpone the entire party and ultimately start over in a
few months, and others might be less drastic, like the need to change the menu when an invited guest indicates
that they can’t eat food containing gluten. These changes are incorporated into the plan during the Making the
Business Plan Realistic stage to make it realistic and feasible.
The Making the Plan Appeal to Stakeholders and Desirable to the Entrepreneur stage involves further changes to
the party plan to make it more appealing to both the invited guests and to make it a fun experience for the host.
For example, the host might learn that some of the single guests would like to bring dates and others might need
to be able to bring their children to be able to attend. The host might be able to accommodate those desires or
needs in ways that will also make the party more fun for them—maybe by accepting some guests’ offers to bring
food or games, or maybe hiring a babysitter to entertain and look after the children.
The final stage—Finishing the Business Plan—involves the host putting all of the final touches in place for the
party in preparation for the arrival of the guests.

Essential Initial Research
A business plan writer should analyze the environment in which they anticipate operating at each of the levels
of analysis: Societal, Industry, Market, and Firm. This stage of planning is called the Essential Initial Research
stage, and it is a necessary first step to better understand the trends that will affect their business and the decisions
they must make to lay the groundwork for, which will improve their potential for success.
In some cases, much of this research should be included in the developing business plan as its own separate
section to help show readers that there is a market need for the business being considered and that it stands a good
chance of being successful.
In other cases, a business plan will be stronger when the components of the research are distributed throughout
the business plan to provide support for the outlined plans and strategies outlined. For example, the industryor market-level research might outline the pricing strategies used by identified competitors, which might be best
placed in the Pricing Strategy part of the business plan to support the decision made to employ a particular pricing
strategy.
Business Model
Inherent in any business plan is a description of the Business Model chosen by the entrepreneur as the one that they
feel will best ensure success. Based upon their analysis from the Essential Initial Research stage, an entrepreneur
should determine how each element of their business model—including their revenue streams, cost structure,
customer segments, value propositions, key activities, key partners, and so on—might fit together to improve the
potential success of their business venture (see Chapter 3 – Business Models).
For some types of ventures, at this stage an entrepreneur might launch a lean start-up (see the “Lean Start-up”
section in Chapter 2 – Essential Initial Research) and grow their business by continually pivoting, or constantly
adjusting their business model in response to the real-time signals they get from the markets’ reactions to their
business operations. In many cases, however, an entrepreneur will require a business plan. In those cases, their
initial business model will provide the basis for that plan.
Of course, throughout this and all of the stages in this process, the entrepreneur should seek to continually
gather information and adjust the plans in response to the new knowledge they gather. As shown in Figure 1
by its enclosure in the Progressive Research box, the business plan developer might need to conduct further
research before finishing the business model and moving on to the initial business plan draft.
Initial Business Plan Draft
The Initial Business Plan Draft stage involves taking the knowledge and ideas developed during the first two
stages and organizing them into a business plan format. Many entrepreneurs prefer to create a full draft of the
business plan with all of the sections, including the front part with the business description, vision, mission,
values, value proposition statement, preliminary set of goals, and possibly even a table of contents and lists of
tables and figures all set up using the software features enabling their automatic generation. Writing all of the
operations, human resources, marketing, and financial plans as part of the first draft ensures that all of these parts

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 12

can be appropriately and necessarily integrated. The business plan will tell the story of a planned business startup
in two ways: 1) by using primarily words along with some charts and graphs in the operations, human resources,
and marketing plans and 2) through the financial plan. Both must tell the same story.
The feedback loop shown in Figure 1 demonstrates that the business developer may need to review the business
model. Additionally, as shown by its enclosure in the Progressive Research box, the business plan developer
might need to conduct further research before finishing the Initial Business Plan Draft stage and moving on to
the Making Business Plan Realistic stage.
Making Business Plan Realistic
The first draft of a business plan will almost never be realistic. As the entrepreneur writes the plan, it will
necessarily change as new information is gathered. Another factor that usually renders the first draft unrealistic
is the difficulty in making certain that the written part—in the front part of the plan along with the operations,
human resources, and marketing plans—tells the exact same story as the financial part does. This stage of work
involves making the necessary adjustments to the plan to make it as realistic as possible.
The Making Business Plan Realistic stage has two possible feedback loops. The first means going back to the
Initial Business Plan Draft stage if the initial business plan needs to be significantly changed before it is possible
to adjust it so that it is realistic. The second feedback loop circles back to the Business Model stage if the business
developer needs to rethink the business model. As shown in Figure 1 by its enclosure in the Progressive Research
box, the business plan developer might need to conduct further research before finishing the Making Business
Plan Realistic stage and moving on to the Making Plan Appeal to Stakeholders stage.
Making Plan Appeal to Stakeholders and Desirable to the Entrepreneur
A business plan can be realistic without appealing to potential investors and other external stakeholders, like
employees, suppliers, and needed business partners. It might also be realistic (and possibly appealing to
stakeholders) without being desirable to the entrepreneur. During this stage, the entrepreneur will keep the
business plan realistic as they adjust plans to appeal to potential investors, stakeholders, and themselves.
If, for example, investors will be required to finance the business’s start, some adjustments might need to be
relatively extensive to appeal to potential investors’ needs for an exit strategy from the business, to accommodate
the rate of return they expect from their investments, and to convince them that the entrepreneur can accomplish
all that is promised in the plan. In this case, and in others, the entrepreneur will also need to get what they want out
of the business to make it worthwhile for them to start and run it. So, this stage of adjustments to the developing
business plan might be fairly extensive, and they must be informed by a superior knowledge of what targeted
investors need from a business proposal before they will invest. They also need to be informed by a clear set of
goals that will make the venture worthwhile for the entrepreneur to pursue.
The caution with this stage is to balance the need to make realistic plans with the desire to meet the entrepreneur’s
goals while avoiding becoming discouraged enough to drop the idea of pursuing the business idea. If an
entrepreneur is convinced that the proposed venture will satisfy a valid market need, there is often a way to

13 • LEE A. SWANSON

assemble the financing required to start and operate the business while also meeting the entrepreneur’s most
important goals. To do so, however, might require significant changes to the business model.
One of the feedback loops shown in Figure 1 indicates that the business plan writer might need to adjust the draft
business plan while ensuring that it is still realistic before it can be made appealing to the targeted stakeholders
and desirable to the entrepreneur. The second feedback loop indicates that it might be necessary to go all the way
back to the Business Model stage to re-establish the framework and plans needed to develop a realistic, appealing,
and desirable business plan. Additionally, this stage’s enclosure in the Progressive Research box suggests that the
business plan developer might need to conduct further research.
Finishing the Business Plan
The final stage involves putting the important finishing touches on the business plan so that it will present well to
potential investors and others. This involves making sure that the math and links between the written and financial
parts are accurate. It involves ensuring that all the needed corrections are made to the spelling, grammar, and
formatting. The final set of goals should be written to appeal to the target readers and to reflect what the business
plan says. An executive summary should be written and included as a final step.

Chapter Summary
This chapter described the internal and external purposes for business planning. It also explained how business
plans must effectively communicate while establishing and building credibility for both the entrepreneur and the
venture. The general guidelines for business planning were covered as were some important business planning
tools. The chapter concluded with descriptions of the stages of the business development process for effective
business planning.

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Apply analytical skills to assess how the nature of the entrepreneurial environment can
influence entrepreneurial outcomes
• Apply the right tools to do impactful analyses at each of the societal, industry, market, and firm
levels to evaluate entrepreneurial and other business opportunities

Overview
This chapter introduces the distinct levels of analyses that must be considered while stressing the importance of
applying the appropriate tools to conduct the analyses at each level.

15 • LEE A. SWANSON

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 16

Support Information
It is important to conduct the essential initial research. All information and items in the plan should be backed
with facts from valid primary or secondary sources. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs can make valid claims
based on experience and expertise. As such, their background and experiences should be delineated to support the
claims made in their business plan.

Evidence-based claims make the business plan stronger.

Levels of Analyses
When evaluating entrepreneurial opportunities—sometimes called idea screening—an effective process involves
assessing the various venture ideas being considered by applying different levels and types of analyses.
Entrepreneurs starting ventures and running existing businesses should also regularly analyze their operating
environments at the societal, industry, market, and firm levels. The right tools, though, must be applied at
each level of analysis (see Figure 3). It is critical to complete the essential initial research at all four levels
(societal, industry, market, and firm). The initial scan should be high-level, designed to assist in making key
decisions (i.e. determining if there is a viable market opportunity for the venture). Secondary scans should
be continuously conducted to support each part of the business plan (i.e. operations, marketing, and finance).
However, information should only be included if it is research-based, relevant, and adds value to the business
plan. The results from such research (i.e. the Bank of Canada indicates that interest rates will be increasing in
the next two years) should support business strategies within the plan (i.e. debt financing may be less favourable
than equity financing). Often, obtaining support data (i.e. construction quotes) is not immediate, so plant a flag
and move forward. Valid useful resources may include information from Statistics Canada, Bank of Canada, IBIS
World Report, etc.
Societal Level
At a societal level, it is important to understand each of the political, economic, social, technological,
environmental, and legal (PESTEL) factors—and, more specifically, the trends affecting those factors—that will
affect a venture based on a particular idea. Some venture ideas might be screened out and others might be worth
pursuing at a particular time because of the trends occurring with those PESTEL factors. When including this
research in your business plan, avoid using technical jargon or informal language that may distract readers (i.e.
rivalry among firms) and use simpler language (i.e. competitive environment).
Industry Level
Analysis of the industry level will focus on the sector of the economy in which you intend to operate. Because the
right analysis tool must be used for the assessment to be effective, apply Porter’s (1985) Five Forces Model, or
a similar tool, to assess industry-level factors. Again, avoid technical jargon (i.e. threat of new entrants) and use

17 • LEE A. SWANSON

simpler wording (i.e. difficulty of entering the market) or flip to an analysis of the threat (i.e. strategies to establish
and maintain market share).
Market Level
At the market level, you need to use a tool to generate information about the part of the industry in which your
business will compete. This tool might be a set of questions designed to uncover information that you need to
know to help develop plans to improve your proposed venture’s success.
Firm Level
At a firm level, both the internal organizational trends and the external market profile trends should be analyzed.
There are several tools for conducting an internal organizational analysis, and you should normally apply many of
them.

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 18

Analyzing the Trends at Each Level

Figure 3 – Different Levels of Analysis (Illustration by Lee A. Swanson)

Analyze Societal-Level Trends
Use an appropriate tool like the PESTEL Model to assess both the current situation and the likely changes that
may affect your venture in the future:
• Political factors – federal & provincial & municipal government policy, nature of political decisions,

19 • LEE A. SWANSON

potential political changes, infrastructure plans, etc.
• Economic factors – interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates, tax rates, GDP growth, health of the
economy, etc.
• Social factors – population characteristics like age distribution and education levels, changes in
demand for types of products and services, etc.
• Technological factors – new processes, new products, infrastructure, etc.
• Environmental factors – effects of climate / weather, water availability, smog and pollution issues, etc.
• Legal factors – labour laws, minimum wage rates, liability issues, etc.
After assessing these factors, analyze the impact these trends have upon the venture:
• Do the trends uncover opportunities and threats?
• Can opportunities be capitalized on?
• Can problems be mitigated?
• Can the venture be sustained?
Analyze Industry-Level Trends
Use an appropriate tool like the Five Forces Model (Porter, 1985) to analyze the industry in which you expect to
operate:
• Horizontal relationships – threat of substitutes, rivalry among existing competitors, threat of new
entrants, etc.
• Vertical Relationships – bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, etc.
Analyze Market-Level Trends
Use an appropriate method like a market profile analysis to assess the position within the industry in which you
expect to operate. To do so, determine the answers to questions like the following:
• How attractive is the market?
• In what way are competitors expected to respond if you enter the market?
• What is the current size of the market and how large is it expected to become?
• What are the current and projected growth rates?
• At what stage of the development cycle is the market?
• What level of profits can be expected in the market?
• What proportion of the market can be captured? What will be the cost to capture this proportion and
what is the cost to capture the proportion required for business sustainability?

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 20

Prior to a new business start-up, the customers that the new business wishes to attract either already purchase the
product or service from a competitor to the new business—or do not yet purchase the product or service at all.
A new venture’s customers, therefore, must come from one of two sources. They must be attracted away from
existing (direct) competitors or be convinced to make different choices about where they spend their money so
they purchase the new venture’s product or service instead of spending their money in other ways (with indirect
competitors). This means an entrepreneur must decide from which source they will attract their customers, and
how they will do so. They must understand the competitive environment.
According to Porter (1996), strategy is about doing different things than competitors or doing similar things but
in different ways. In order to develop an effective strategy, an entrepreneur must understand the competition.
To understanding the competitive environment, entrepreneurs must do the following:
• Determine who their current direct and indirect competitors are and who the future competitors may be
• Understand the similarities and differences in quality, price, competitive advantages, and other factors
that exist between their proposed business and the existing competitors
• Establish whether they can offer different products or services—or the same products or services in
different ways—to attract enough customers to meet their goals
• Anticipate how the competitors will react in response to the new venture’s entry into the market
Analyze Firm-Level Trends (organizational analysis)
There are several tools available for firm-level analysis, and usually several of them should be applied because
they serve different purposes.
Tools like a SWOT Analysis or TOWS Matrix can formulate and evaluate potential strategies to leverage
organizational strengths, overcome/minimize weaknesses, take advantage of opportunities, and overcome/
minimize threats. You will also need to do a financial analysis and consider the founder fit and the competencies
a venture should possess.
• SWOT Analysis – identify organizational strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and
threats
• TOWS Matrix – develop strategies to
◦ Leverage strengths to take advantage of opportunities
◦ Leverage strengths to overcome threats
◦ Mitigate weaknesses by taking advantage of opportunities
◦ Mitigate weaknesses while minimizing the potential threats or the potential outcomes from
threats
To analyze a firm’s strategy, apply a VRIO Framework analysis, as Barney (1997) and Barney and Hesterly

21 • LEE A. SWANSON

(2006) outline. While conceptualizing the resource-based view (RBV) of a firm, they identified the following four
considerations regarding resources and their ability to help a firm gain a competitive advantage. Together, the
following four questions make up the VRIO Framework, which can assess a firm’s capacity and determine what
competencies a venture should have. To use this tool, you need to determine whether competencies are valuable,
rare, inimitable, and organized in a way that they can be exploited:
• Value – Is a particular resource (financial, physical, technological, organizational, human, reputational,
innovative) valuable to a firm because it helps it take advantage of opportunities or eliminate threats?
• Rarity – Is a particular resource rare in that it is controlled by or available to relatively few others?
• Imitability – Is a particular resource difficult to imitate so that those who have it can retain cost
advantages over those who might try to obtain or duplicate it?
• Organization – Are the resources available to a firm useful to it because it is organized and ready to
exploit them?
To assess the financial attractiveness of the venture, analyze
• Similar firms in industry
◦ Comparative ratio and financial analysis (Vesper, 1996, p. 145-148) can help determine
industry norm returns, turnover ratios, working capital, operating efficiency, and other
measures of firm success.
• Projected market share
◦ Analyzes the key industry players’ relative market share, and make judgments about how the
proposed venture would fare within the industry.
◦ Uses information from market profile analysis and key industry player analysis.
• Margin analysis
◦ Involves projecting expected margins from venture
◦ Useful information might come from financial analysis, market profile analysis, and NAICS
(North American Industry Classification System) codes (six digit codes used to identify an
industry—first five digits are standardized in Canada, the United States, and Mexico—is
gradually replacing the four digit SIC [Standard Industrial Classification] codes)
• Break-even analysis
◦ Involves using information from margin analysis to determine break-even volume and break
even sales in dollars
◦ Is there sufficient volume to sustain the venture?
• Pro forma analysis
◦ Forecasts income and assets required to generate profits

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 22

• Sensitivity analysis
◦ What will be the likely impact if some assumed variable values change?
• Return on investment (ROI) projections
◦ Projects the ROI from undertaking the venture
◦ What is the opportunity cost of undertaking the venture?
Founder fit is an important consideration for entrepreneurs screening venture opportunities. While there are
plenty of examples of entrepreneurs successfully starting all types of businesses, “technical capability can be an
important if not all-important factor in pursuing ventures success” (Vesper, 1996, p. 149). Factors such as the
experience, training, credentials, reputation, and social capital an entrepreneur has can play an important role
in their success or failure in starting a new venture. Even when an entrepreneur can recruit expert help through
business partners or employees, it might be important that he or she also possess technical skills required in that
particular kind of business.
• A common and useful way to help screen venture options is to seek input from experts, peers, mentors,
business associates, and perhaps other stakeholders like potential customers and direct family
members.
Completing a TOWS Matrix develops strategies from the SWOT Analysis and strengthens your business plan.
Reference your technical skill, as this is a major factor in your venture’s success.

Lean Start-up
Ries (2011) defines a lean start-up as “a human institution designed to create a new product or service under
conditions of extreme uncertainty” (p. 27). The lean-start-up approach involves releasing a minimal viable product
to customers with the expectation that this early prototype will change and evolve frequently and quickly in
response to customer feedback. This is meant to be a relatively easy and inexpensive way to develop a product or
service by relying on customer feedback to guide the pivots in new directions that will ultimately—and relatively
quickly—lead to a product or service with the appeal required for business success. It is only then that the actual
business will truly emerge. As such, entrepreneurs that apply the lean-start-up approach—because their business
idea allows for it—actually forgo developing a business plan, at least until they might need one later to get
financing, because introducing a minimum viable product helps “entrepreneurs start the process of learning as
quickly as possible” (Ries, 2011, p. 93). This is followed by ever improving versions of their products or services.
However, all entrepreneurs must directly consult with their potential target purchasers and end users to assess
if and how the market might respond to their proposed venture. The Essential Initial Research and Progressive
Research stages should include purposeful and meaningful interactions between the entrepreneur and the target
purchasers and end users.
Ries’s (2011) five lean-start-up principles start with the idea that entrepreneurs are everywhere and that anyone

23 • LEE A. SWANSON

working in an environment where they seek to create new products or services “under conditions of extreme
uncertainty” (p. 27) can use the lean-start-up approach. Second, a start-up is more than the product or service: it
is an institution that must be managed in a new way that promotes growth through innovation. Third, start-ups
are about learning “how to build a sustainable business” (p. 8-9) by validating product or service design through
frequent prototyping that allows entrepreneurs to test the concepts. Forth, start-ups must follow this process or
feedback loop: create products and services; measure how the market reacts to them; and learn from that to
determine whether to pivot or to persevere with an outcome the market accepts. Finally, Ries (2011) suggested
that entrepreneurial outcomes and innovation initiatives need to be measured through innovative accounting.

Chapter Summary
By applying the right tools to analyze the operating environment at each of the societal, industry, market, and
firm levels, entrepreneurs screen venture ideas, plan new venture development, and potentially detect factors that
might affect their business operations. The lean start-up is an alternative that can be used to circumvent the usual

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 24

planning steps in favour of continuous innovation. See Figure 4 for other resources on business models and lean
start-ups.

Chapter 3 – Business Models

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Describe what a business model is
• Analyze existing and proposed businesses to determine what business models they are applying
and what business models they plan to apply
• Develop and analyze alternative business models for new entrepreneurial ventures

Overview
In this chapter the concept of the business model is introduced. One concept of the business model in particular,
the Business Model Canvas, is explored as a way to conceptualize and categorize elements of a business model.

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 26

Figure 5 – Business Model (Illustration by Lee A. Swanson)

27 • LEE A. SWANSON

What are Business Models?
Magretta (2002) described business models as “stories that explain how enterprises work” (p. 87) and
Osterwalder, Pigneur, and Clark (2010) noted that they reveal “the rationale of how an organization creates,
delivers, and captures value” (p. 14). Chatterjee (2013) said that “A business is about selling what you make for
a profit. A business model is a configuration (activity systems) of what the business does (activities) and what it
invests in (resources) based on the logic that drives the profits for a specific business” (p. 97).
Osterwalder et al. (2010) said that a start-up is something quite different than an ongoing venture. A start-up
should not be viewed as a smaller version of a company because it requires very different skills to start up a
company than it does to operate one. A start-up that is still a start-up after some time has passed—maybe after
a couple of years for some kinds of start-ups—is actually a failed enterprise since it hasn’t converted into an
ongoing venture. Entrepreneurs who develop a business model for their ventures that deliver value to the targeted
customers and to the entrepreneur stand a better chance of converting their start-up into an ongoing venture.

The Business Model Canvas
The business model canvas is made up of nine parts that, together, describe the business model (see Figure 6).

were

taken,

with

permission,

from

• Key partners
◦ Who are our key partners?
◦ Who are our key suppliers?
◦ Which key resources are we acquiring from partners?
◦ Which key activities do partners perform?
◦ Motivations for partnerships: optimization and economy; reduction of risk and uncertainty;
acquisition of particular resources and activities
• Key activities
◦ What key activities do our value propositions require?
◦ Our distribution channels?
◦ Customer relationships?
◦ Revenue streams?
◦ Categories: production; problem solving; platform/network
• Key resources
◦ What key resources do our value propositions require?
◦ Our distribution channels?
◦ Customer relationships?
◦ Revenue streams?
◦ Types of resources: physical; intellectual (brand patents, copyrights, data); human; financial
• Value propositions
◦ What value do we deliver to the customer?
◦ Which one of our customer’s problems are we helping to solve?
◦ What bundles of products and services are we offering to each customer segment?
◦ Which customer needs are we satisfying?
◦ Characteristics: newness; performance; customization; “getting the job done”; design; brand/
status; price; cost reduction; risk reduction; accessibility; convenience/usability
• Customer relationships

29 • LEE A. SWANSON

◦ What type of relationship does each of our customer segments expect us to establish and
maintain with them?
◦ Which ones have we established?
◦ How are they integrated with the rest of our business model?
◦ How costly are they?
◦ Examples: personal assistance; dedicated personal assistance; self-service; automated
services; communities; co-creation
• Customer segments
◦ For whom are we creating value?
◦ Who are our most important customers?
◦ Mass market; niche market; segmented; diversified; multi-sided platform
• Channels
◦ Through which channels do our customer segments want to be reached?
◦ How are we reaching them now?
◦ How are our channels integrated?
◦ Which ones work best?
◦ Which ones are most cost-efficient?
◦ How are we integrating them with customer routines?
◦ Channel phases:
▪ awareness – How do we raise awareness about our company’s products and
services?
▪ evaluation – How do we help customers evaluate our organization’s value
proposition?
▪ purchase – How do we allow customers to purchase specific products and
services?
▪ delivery – How do we deliver a value proposition to customers?
▪ after sales – How do we provide post-purchase customer support?
• Revenue streams
◦ For what value are our customers really willing to pay?
◦ For what do they currently pay?
◦ How are they currently paying?
◦ How would they prefer to pay?

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 30

◦ How much does each revenue stream contribute to overall revenues?
◦ Types: asset sale; usage fee; subscription fees; lending/renting/leasing; licensing; brokerage
fees; advertising
◦ Fixed pricing: list price; product feature dependent; customer segment dependent; volume
dependent
◦ Dynamic pricing: negotiation (bargaining); yield management; real-time-market
• Cost structure
◦ What are the most important costs inherent in our business model?
◦ Which key resources are most expensive?
◦ Which key activities are most expensive?
◦ Is our business more cost driven (leanest cost structure, low price value proposition,
maximum automation, extensive outsourcing) or value driven (focused on value creation,
premium value proposition)?
◦ Sample characteristics: fixed costs (salaries, rents, utilities); variable costs; economies of
scale; economies of scope
The idea is to keep adding descriptions or plans to the nine components to create the initial business model and
then to actually do the start-up activities and replace the initial assumptions in each of the nine parts with newer
and better information or plans and let the business model evolve. This model is partly based on the idea that
the owner should be the one interacting with potential customers so they fully understands what these potential
customers want. These interactions should not only be done by hired sales people, at least until the business model
has evolved into one that works, because this evolution can only happen when the venture owner is completely
engaged with the potential customers and the other business operations (Osterwalder et al., 2010).
A business plan shouldn’t be created until the above has been done because you need to know what your business
model is before you can really create a business plan (Osterwalder et al., 2010). Thus, the Business Model Canvas
is best suited to technology-based and other types of companies that can be started and operated in some way and
later converted into an ongoing venture. By starting operations and making adjustments as you go along, you are
actually doing a form of market research that can be compiled into a full business plan when one is needed.
According to Osterwalder et al. (2010), the things we typically teach people in business school are geared
to helping people survive in larger, ongoing businesses. What is taught—including organizational structures,
reporting lines, managing sales teams, advertising, and similar topics—is not designed to help students understand
how a start-up works and how to deal with the volatile nature of new ventures. The Business Model Canvas tool
is meant to help us understand start-ups better.
The Business Model Canvas tool is intended to be applied when business operations can be started on a small
scale and adjustments can be made continually until the evolving business model works in real life. This contrasts
the more traditional approach of pre-planning everything, going through the set-up and start-up processes, and

31 • LEE A. SWANSON

ending up with a business venture that opens for business one day without having proven at all that the business
model it is founded upon will even work. These traditional start-ups sometimes flounder along as the owners find
that their plans are not quite working out and they try to make adjustments on the fly. It can be difficult to adjust,
though, because the processes are already set up. For example, sales teams might be in the field trying to make
sales and blaming the product developers for the difficulty they are having, and the product developers might be
blaming the sales teams for not being able to sell the product properly. The real issue might be that the company
simply isn’t meeting customers’ needs and they don’t have any good mechanism for detecting, understanding, and
fixing this problem.

Chapter Summary
This chapter described business models and presented the Business Model Canvas as a tool that entrepreneurs can
use to develop and define their own business models.

Chapter 4 – Initial Business Plan Draft

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Develop a comprehensive business plan draft

Overview
This chapter describes an approach to writing your draft business plan. It also outlines the elements of a
comprehensive business plan that can be used as a template for starting your business plan.

33 • LEE A. SWANSON

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 34

Effective Business Plans
Effective business plans
• Provide statements that are backed by evidence or data
• Include context and references with every table, figure, or illustration
• Include relevant, clear, concise tables and financial information, and exclude unnecessary material
• Present timelines for distinct purposes
• Use clear sections customized to the particular business or its environment rather than generic sections
Evidence-based claims strengthen your business plan.
Providing context for tables and figures is critical.

Writing the Draft Business Plan
Although there are various ways to approach the task of writing a draft business plan, one effective approach is to
do the following:
• Use the following sections of this chapter to prepare an outline for your business plan. You should use
the headings feature in Word so that you can later automatically generate a table of contents
◦ This will provide you with a template for the information needed for your plan.
• Insert the relevant parts of the written work produced during essential initial research into your new
business plan template. You can do this in one of two ways:
◦ You can copy and paste the results of your essential initial research into the sections of your
business plan template where you believe that they can be used to support or justify the
strategies and other decisions you will later describe in those sections. Of course, you can
later move those parts of your environmental scan as needed as you develop your plan. In
general, this strategy results in a stronger business plan.
◦ Or you can insert the results from your societal-level and industry-level analyses in an
Operating Environment section as listed in the outline below. As described below, the
market-level analysis will probably always fit best within the Marketing Plan and the firmlevel analysis might fit across all of the plans within the business plan.
▪ Completing this step will give you the satisfaction of seeing some of your work so
far taking shape in the form of a business plan.
▪ Also, inserting the results from your environmental scan into the relevant sections
of your plan should later provide you with the stimulus and support you will need
to develop solid, realistic, evidence-based strategies and decisions for those

35 • LEE A. SWANSON

sections.
• Incorporate your business model into your new business plan template. As there is no section in a
business plan in which you specifically describe your business model, you will need to incorporate
your business model elements into appropriate sections of your plan.
• Fill in as much relevant information as you can under as many of the headings on your business plan
template as possible.
◦ You will normally include both information that you got from particular sources and
information based on an assumption you made (and that you might intend to replace later
with more accurate information from valid sources).
Follow these practices as you develop your plan:
• Every time that you insert something into your business plan template that you got from a supplier’s
catalogue, clearly indicate from where you got that information. For example, if you list the office
equipment and furniture that you need along with their exact costs as taken from suppliers’ catalogue,
clearly indicate from which catalogue(s) you got the information. Similarly, if you spoke to an industry
expert who recommended that you manufacture your product in a particular way, clearly indicate who
you spoke to and what their credentials are, if you got the person’s permission to do so.
◦ When you do this, you help establish your credibility as a business plan writer, and your
business plan’s credibility. It also might save you time later when you discover that you need
to add a similar item along with its cost to your list.
◦ Note: Do not reinvent the wheel by “inventing” your own method to reference your sources
and do not use multiple methods. Use one (and only one) proper and well-established
referencing method, like APA. This will improve the degree of professionalism of your plan.
• Every time that you insert something into your plan that did not come from a source, a best practice is
to highlight that part of your plan, possibly by using a distinct font color. The objective will be to
ultimately replace all of those assumptions with source-backed information. When you do so, change
the font to its regular color so you can quickly and easily see what still needs to be sourced.
◦ Note: if you are an expert source on something—maybe you are a construction expert that
business plan readers will trust to do estimates on building costs—you should establish your
credentials and clearly indicate when some of the information in your plan is based on your
own expert knowledge.
◦ When you flag your assumptions in this way, you can quickly and easily see what
information needs to be replaced with sourced information before you finalize your business
plan.
• Use the appropriate schedule in the spreadsheet templates to record estimated sales revenue for each
month. You must base these sales projections on well-reasoned criteria and set them up in your
spreadsheets using formulas so that if you need to change a criterion later, you can change a number in

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 36

one cell or a limited number of cells rather than having to change all of them.
◦ Projecting realistic sales can be difficult, but setting up a method for doing so early gives
business plan writers a significant start toward completing their business plan. A welldeveloped sales model that takes advantage of the powers of electronic spreadsheets gives
business plan writers the opportunity to relatively quickly and easily make necessary
changes to their assumptions and overall estimates when needed.
• Use the spreadsheet templates by filling in all of the numbers you have in the various schedules. As
you are doing in the written part of your plan, use a distinct font to flag numbers that are based on
assumptions. When you have actual numbers, be certain that it is clear to a reader what sources you
used to get those numbers.
◦ When you use the schedules provided on the spreadsheet templates, and any others that you
add, you will be well on your way to developing the financial component of your business
plan.

Providing references strengthens the credibility of claims and makes the business plan stronger.

General Business Plan Format
Letter of Transmittal
A letter of transmittal is similar to the cover letter of a resume. The letter of transmittal should be tailored to the
reader, clearly identifying the customized ask of the potential investor or lender. It should be short and succinct,
delineating the ask (i.e. funding, specialized recruiting, purchasing a product or service, obtaining advice, etc.)
within a few paragraphs. It should not summarize the business plan, as that is the job of the executive summary.
Title Page
• Includes nice, catchy, professional, appropriate graphics to make it appealing for targeted readers
Executive Summary
• Can be longer than normal executive summaries—up to three pages
• Written after remainder of plan is complete
• Includes information relevant to targeted readers as this is the place where they are most likely to form
their first impressions of the business idea and decide whether they wish to read the rest of the plan

37 • LEE A. SWANSON

Table of Contents
List of Tables
• References every table, figure, and appendix within the text of the plan so the relevance of each of
these elements is clear.
List of Figures
Introduction
• Indicates the purpose for the plan
• Appeals to targeted readers
Business Idea
• May include description of history behind the idea and the evolution of the business concept if relevant
Value Proposition
• Explains how your business idea solves a problem for your expected customers or otherwise should
make them want to purchase your product or service instead of a competitor’s
Vision
• Outlines what you intend for the venture to be
• Inspires all members of the organization
• Helps stakeholders aspire to achieve greater things through the venture because of the general direction
provided through the vision statement
After articulating a good vision, the business plan writer should consider what achieving the vision looks like.
Many business plan writers write their vision and leave it at that. The problem with this approach is that they
often then do not take the necessary steps to illustrate how the strategies they outline in their plan will move them
toward achieving their vision. If they make this mistake, their strategies might indicate that they are fulfilling their
current mission, but are not taking steps to move beyond that.

Vision statements should be clear with context throughout the business plan. For example, if the goal is to be
the premier business operating in that industry in Saskatchewan, does that mean you have one location and are
considered the best at what you do it even though you only have a small corner of the market, or does it mean that
you have many locations across the province and enjoy a large market share?

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 38

Vision statements should be clear with context throughout the business plan.

Mission
• Should be very brief—a few sentences or a short paragraph
• Indicates what your organization does and why it exists—may describe the business strategy and
philosophy
Values
• Consists of five to ten short statements indicating the important values that will guide everything the
business will do
• Outlines the personal commitments members of the organization must make, and what they should
consider to be important
• Defines how people behave and interact with each other
• Should be reflected in all of the decisions outlined in the business plan, from hiring to promotions to
location choices
• Helps the reader understand the type of culture and operating environment this business intends to
develop
Major Goals
• Describes the major organizational goals
• Ensures each goal is
◦ Specific, Measurable, Action oriented, Realistic, and Timely [SMART]
◦ Realistic, Understandable, Measureable, Believable, and Achievable [RUMBA]
• Aligns with everything in plan
• Written, or re-written as the second last thing you do before finalizing your business plan by
proofreading, polishing, and printing it (writing the Executive Summary is the final thing you should
write)

SMART and RUMBA goals strengthen the business plan.

39 • LEE A. SWANSON

Operating Environment
Trend Analysis
• Usually includes an analysis of how the current and expected trends in the political, economic, social,
technological, environmental, and legal (PESTEL) factors will impact the development of this business
◦ However, consider whether this is the right place for this analysis: it may be better
positioned, for example, in the Financial Plan section to provide context to the analysis of
the critical success factors, or in the Marketing Plan to help the reader understand the basis
for the sales projections.
Industry Analysis
• Includes an analysis of the industry in which this business will operate
• Typically applies the Five Forces Model (Porter, 1985)
◦ As above, consider whether this is the right place for this analysis: it may be better placed,
for example, in the Marketing Plan to enhance the competitor analysis, or in the Financial
plan to provide context to the industry standard ratios in the Investment Analysis section.
Of course, your trend analysis will also include a market-level analysis (using a set of questions, like those listed
in Chapter 2) and a firm-level analysis (using tools like a SWOT Analysis / TOWS Matrix, various forms of
financial analyses, a founder fit analysis, and so on), but those analyses are usually best placed in other sections of
your plan to support the strategies and decisions you present there. The market-level analysis will inevitably fit in
the Marketing Plan section, but the firm-level analysis might be spread across some or all of the Operating Plan,
Human Resources Plan, Marketing Plan, and Financial Plan sections.
Operations Plan
• Answers the following key questions :
◦ What constraints are you operating under that will restrict your capacity to produce and sell
your product?
▪ Given these constraints, what is your operating capacity (in terms of production,
sales, etc.)?
◦ What is the work flow plan for your operation?
◦ What work will your company do and what work will you outsource?
Operations Timeline
• Answers the following questions:
◦ When will you make the preparations, such as registering the business name and purchasing

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 40

equipment, to start the venture?
◦ When will you begin operations and make your first sales?
◦ When will other milestone events occur such as moving operations to a larger facility,
offering a new product line, hiring new key employees, and beginning to sell products
internationally?
◦ Sometimes it is useful to include a graphical timeline showing when these milestone events
have occurred and are expected to occur.

Completing the operation plans further adds to the overall business plan.

Business Structure and other Set-up Elements
• Indicates the legal structure your venture will take:
◦ Sole Proprietorship
◦ Partnership
◦ Limited Partnership
◦ Corporation
◦ Cooperative
Note: Your financial statements, risk management strategy, and other elements of your plan are affected by the
type of legal structure you choose for your business. For example, all partnerships should have a clear agreement
outlining the duties, expectations, and compensation of all partners as well as the process of dissolution.
Spreadsheet templates are formatted for corporations and will need to be formatted for other forms of businesses.
• Describes your decisions related to the following:
◦ Naming
◦ Zoning, equipment prices, suppliers, etc.
◦ Location
◦ Leasing terms, leasehold improvements, signage, pay deposits, etc.
◦ Getting business license, permits, etc.
◦ Setting up banking arrangements
◦ Setting up legal and accounting systems (or professionals)
◦ Ordering equipment, locks and keys, furniture, etc.
◦ Recruiting employees, setting up the payroll system and benefit programs, etc.

41 • LEE A. SWANSON

◦ Training employees
◦ Testing the products/services that will be offered
◦ Testing the systems for supply, sales, delivery, and other functions
◦ Creating graphics, logos, promotional methods, etc.
◦ Ordering business cards, letter head, etc.
◦ Setting up supplier agreements and outlining why those sellers are preferred
◦ Buying inventory, insurance, etc.
◦ Revising business plan
◦ And many more things, including, when possible, attracting purchased orders in advance of
start-up through personal selling (by the owner, a paid sales force, independent
representatives, or by selling through brokers wholesalers, catalogue houses, retailers), a
promotional campaign, or other means
Note: As part of your business set-up, you need to determine what kinds of control systems you should have in
place, establish necessary relationships with suppliers prior to your start-up, and generally deal with a list of issues
like those mentioned above.
Start-up
• Answers the following questions:
◦ What is required to start-up your business including the purchases and activities that must
occur before you make your first sale?
◦ When identifying capital requirements for start-up, a distinction should be made between
fixed capital requirements and working capital requirements.
Fixed Capital Requirements
• Answers the following question:
◦ What fixed assets, including equipment and machinery, must be purchased so your venture
can conduct its business?
• May include a start-up budget showing the machinery, equipment, furnishings, renovations, and other
capital expenditures required prior to operations commencing
◦ May also show the financing required, often in the form of longer-term loans
Working Capital Requirements
• Answers the following question:

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 42

◦ What money is needed to operate the business (separately from the money needed to
purchase fixed assets) including the money needed to purchase inventory and pay initial
expenses?
• May include a start-up budget showing the cash required to purchase starting inventories, recruit
employees, conduct market research, acquire licenses, hire lawyers, and other operating expenditures
required prior to starting operations
◦ May also show the financing required. Working capital is usually financed with operating
loans, trade credit, credit card debt, or other forms of shorter-term loans
Risk Management Strategies
• Includes descriptions of the organization’s risk exposure
◦ Enterprise – liability exposure for things like when someone accuses your employees or
products you sell of injuring them
◦ Financial – securing loans when needed and otherwise having the right amount of money
when you need it
◦ Operational – securing needed inventories, recruiting needed employees in tight labour
markets, operating when customers you counted on not purchasing product as you had
anticipated, managing theft, arson, and natural disasters like fires and floods, etc.
• Always includes descriptions of the planned strategies for managing each of the risks identified.
Identifies potential risk exposures, their consequences, risk potential, and mitigation strategies (Figure
8).
◦ Avoid – choose to avoid doing something, outsource, etc.
◦ Reduce – through training, assuming specific operational strategies, etc.
◦ Transfer – insure against, outsource, etc.
◦ Assume – self-insure, accept, etc.

Figure 8 – Risk Management Strategies (Illustration by Lee A. Swanson)

Completing a risk management plan further adds to the overall business plan.

43 • LEE A. SWANSON

Operating Processes
• Answers the following key questions:
◦ What operating processes will you apply?
◦ Depending upon the type of business, describes things like
▪ Retail and wholesale operations

◦ What are your facility plans?
◦ Where will your facility be located?
▪ Expressed as a set physical location
▪ Expressed as a set of requirements and characteristics
◦ How large will your facility be and why must it be this size?
◦ How much will it cost to buy or lease your facility?

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 44

◦ What utility, parking, and other costs must you pay for this facility?
◦ What expansion plans must be factored into the facility requirements?
◦ What transportation and storage issues must be addressed by facility decisions?
◦ What zoning and other legal issues must you deal with?
◦ What will be the layout for your facility and how will this best accommodate customer and
employee requirements?
Organizational Structure
• May include information on Advisory Boards or Board of Directors from which the company will seek
advice or guidance or direction
• May include an organizational chart
• Can be a nice lead-in to the Human Resources Plan

◦ How do you describe your desired corporate culture?
◦ What are the key positions within your organization?
◦ How many employees will you have?
◦ What characteristics define your desired employees?
◦ What is your recruitment strategy? What processes will you apply to hire the employees you
require?

◦ Have you shown and described an organizational chart?
Recruitment and Retention Strategies
• Includes how many employees are required at what times

45 • LEE A. SWANSON

• Estimates time required to recruit needed employees
• Estimates all recruitment costs including:
◦ Employment advertisements
◦ Contracts with employment agency or search firms
◦ Travel and accommodations for potential employees to come for interviews
◦ Travel and accommodations for interviewers
◦ Facility, food, lost time, and other interviewing costs
◦ Relocation allowances for those hired including flights, moving companies, housing
allowances, spousal employment assistance, etc.
• May include a schedule showing the costs of initial recruitment that then flows into your start-up
expense schedules
Leadership and Management Strategies
• Outlines your leadership philosophy
• Explains why it is the most appropriate leadership approach for this venture
Training

◦ What training is required because of existing rules and regulations?
◦ How will you ensure your employees are as capable as required?
◦ In which of the following areas will you provide training for your employees?
▪ Health and safety (legislation, WHMIS, first aid, defibulators, etc.)
▪ Initial workplace orientation
▪ Management
▪ Financial systems
▪ Sales
▪ Contracts

▪ Other
Performance Appraisals
• Identifies how you will manage your performance appraisal systems

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 46

Health and Safety
• Notes any legal requirements (and also legal requirements for other issues that may be included in
other parts of the plan)
• Identifies accreditation you might pursue, such as ISO 9000, and if so, evaluates the costs, benefits,
and time frame
• Outlines training for employees, such as WHMIS training or machinery handling training
Compensation
• Always justifies your planned employee compensation methods and amounts
• Always includes all components of the compensation (CPP, EI, holiday pay, etc.)
• Identifies how you will ensure both internal and external equity in your pay systems
• Describes any incentive-based pay or profit sharing systems planned
• May include a schedule that shows the financial implications of your compensation strategy and
supports the cash flow and income statements shown later
Key Personnel
• May include brief biographies of the key organizational people

Completing the human resources plan further adds credibility to the overall business plan.

Marketing Plan
• Identifies the primary and secondary research you have done
◦ You must show evidence of having done proper research, both primary and secondary. If you
make a statement of fact, you must back it up with properly referenced supporting evidence.
If you indicate a claim is based on your own assumptions, you must back this up with a
description as to how you came to the conclusion.
• Shows an effective analysis of the economic environment relevant to your business
◦ It is a given that you must provide some assessment of the economic situation as it relates to
your business. For example, you might conclude that the current economic crisis will reduce
the potential to export your product and it may make it more difficult to acquire credit with
which to operate your business. Of course, conclusions such as these should be matched with
your assessment as to how your business will make the necessary adjustments to ensure it
will thrive despite these challenges, or how it will take advantage of any opportunities your

47 • LEE A. SWANSON

assessment uncovers.
• Shows an effective assessment of the industry within which your venture will operate
◦ You must provide an assessment of the industry coupled with descriptions of how your
venture will prosper in those circumstances. A common approach used to assess the industry
is to apply Porter’s (1985) Five Forces Model.
▪ If you apply the Five Forces Model, do so in the way in which it was meant to be
used to avoid significantly reducing its usefulness while also harming the viability
of your industry analysis. This model is meant to be used to consider the entire
industry, not a subcomponent of it (and it usually cannot be used to analyze a
single organization).
◦ Your competitor analysis might fit within your assessment of the industry, or it might be best
as a section within your marketing plan. Usually a fairly detailed description of your
competitors is required, including an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. In some
cases, your business may have direct and indirect competitors to consider. Maintain
credibility by demonstrating that you fully understand the competitive environment.
◦ Assessments of the economic conditions and the state of the industry appear incomplete
without accompanying appraisals outlining the strategies the organization can/should employ
to take advantage of these economic and industry situations. So, depending upon how you
have organized your work, it is usually important to couple your appraisal of the economic
and industry conditions with accompanying strategies for your venture. This shows the
reader that you not only understand the operating environment, but that you have figured out
how best to operate your business within that situation.
• Outlines an effective analysis of your venture (see the Organizational Analysis section below)
Primary and secondary data further add to the strength of the business plan.
Completing the marketing plan further adds to the overall business plan.

Market Analysis
• Usually contains customer profiles, constructed through primary and secondary research, for each
market targeted
• Contains detailed information on the major product benefits you will deliver to the markets targeted
• Describes the methodology used and the relevant results from the primary market research completed
• If there was little primary research completed, justifies why it is acceptable to have done little of this
kind of research and/or indicate what will be done and by when
• Includes a complete description of the secondary research conducted and the conclusions reached

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 48

• Describes the potential customers
◦ Define your target market in terms of identifiable entities sharing common characteristics.
For example, it is not meaningful to indicate you are targeting Canadian universities. It is,
however, useful to define your target market as Canadian university students between the
ages of 18 and 25, or as information technology managers at Canadian universities, or as
student leaders at Canadian universities. Your targeted customer should generally be able to
make or significantly influence the buying decision.
◦ You must usually define your target market prior to describing your marketing mix,
including your proposed product line. Sometimes the product descriptions in business plans
seem to be at odds with the described target market characteristics. Ensure your defined
target market aligns completely with your marketing mix (including product/service
description, distribution channels, promotional methods, and pricing). For example, if the
target market is defined as Canadian university students between the ages of 18 and 25, the
product component of the marketing mix should clearly be something that appeals to this
target market.
◦ Carefully choose how you will target potential customers. Should you target them based on
their demographic characteristics, psychographic characteristics, or geographic location?
• Identify how your targeted customers make their buying decisions
◦ You will need to access research to answer this question. Based on what you discover, you
will need to figure out the optimum mix of pricing, distribution, promotions, and product
decisions to best appeal to how your targeted customers make their buying decisions.
Competition
• Fully describes the nature of your competitors
◦ However, this information might fit instead under the market analysis section.
• Describes all your direct competitors
• Describes all your indirect competitors
• If you can, includes a competitor positioning map to show where your product will be positioned
relative to competitors’ products
◦ If you include a competitor positioning map, insure that the x-axis and y-axis are
meaningful. Often, competitor maps include quality and price as axes. Unless you can
clearly articulate the distinction between high quality and low quality, it may be more
valuable to have more meaningful axes or describe your value proposition relative to your
competitors in the absence of a positioning map.

49 • LEE A. SWANSON

Figure 9 – Competitor Positioning Map (Illustration by Lee A. Swanson)

• Identifies your competitive advantage, your venture`s value proposition, and what distinguishes your
business from that of your competitors in a way that will ensure your sales forecasts will be met
◦ You must clearly communicate the answers to these questions in your business plan in order
to attract the needed support for your business. One caution is that it may sound appealing to
claim you will provide a superior service to the existing competitors, but the only
meaningful judge of your success in this regard will be customers. Although it is possible
some of your competitors might be complacent in their current way of doing things, it is very
unlikely that all your competitors provide an inferior service to that which you will be able to
provide.

Demonstrating a competitive advantage makes the business plan stronger. A competitor positioning map provides
context as to where your venture fits in the competitive landscape.

Marketing Strategy
• Covers all aspects of the marketing mix: your promotional decisions, product decisions, distribution
decisions, and pricing decisions

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 50

• Outlines how you plan to influence your targeted customers to buy from you (your optimum marketing
mix, and why is this one better than the alternatives)
Organizational Analysis
• Leads in to your marketing strategy or is positioned elsewhere depending upon how your business plan
is best structured
• Often applies a SWOT Analysis to analyze the organization
◦ If doing so, ALWAYS ensure this analysis results in more than a simple list of internal
strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats. A SWOT analysis should
always prove to the reader that there are organizational strategies in place to address each of
the weaknesses and threats identified and to leverage each of the strengths and opportunities
identified.
◦ An effective way to ensure an effective outcome to your SWOT Analysis is to apply a
TOWS Matrix approach to develop strategies to take advantage of the identified strengths
and opportunities while mitigating the weaknesses and threats. A TOWS Matrix evaluates
each of the identified threats along with each of the weaknesses and then each of the
strengths. It does the same with each of the identified opportunities. In this way strategies are
developed by considering pairs of factors.
◦ The TOWS Matrix is a framework with which to help you organize your thoughts into
strategies. Most often you would not label a section of your business plan as a TOWS Matrix
because this would not add value for the reader. Instead, you should describe the resultant
strategies—perhaps while indicating how they were derived from your assessment of the
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. For example, you could indicate that
certain strategies were developed by considering how internal strengths could be employed
toward mitigating external threats faced by the business.
Product Strategy
• Identifies your product/service and why this particular product/service will appeal to your targeted
customers more than the alternatives
◦ If your product or service is standardized, you will need to compete on the basis of
something else—like a more appealing price, having a superior location, better branding, or
improved service. If you can differentiate your product or service, you might be able to
compete on the basis of better quality, more features, appealing style, or something else.
When describing your product, you should demonstrate that you understand this.
Pricing Strategy
• Outlines your pricing strategies and explains what makes these strategies better than the alternatives

51 • LEE A. SWANSON

◦ If you intend to accept payment by credit card (which is probably a necessity for most
companies), you should be aware of the fee you are charged as a percentage of the value of
each transaction. If you don’t account for this you risk overstating your actual revenues by
perhaps one percent or more.
• Identifies your sales forecasts and explains why these are realistic
◦ Sales forecasts must be done on at least a monthly basis if you are using a projected cash
flow statement. These must be accompanied by explanations designed to establish their
credibility for readers of your business plan. Remember that many readers will initially
assume your planned time frames are too long, your revenues are overstated, and you have
underestimated your expenses. Well crafted explanations for all of these numbers will help
establish credibility.
Distribution Strategy
• Explains your distribution strategies and what makes these strategies better than the alternatives
◦ If you plan to use e-commerce, you should include all the costs associated with maintaining
a website and accepting payments over the Internet.
Promotions Strategy
• Answers the following key questions:
◦ As a new entrant into the market, must you attract your customers away from your
competitors they currently buy from or will you be creating new customers for your product
or service (i.e. not attracting customers away from your competitors)?
◦ If you are attracting customers away from competitors, how will these rivals respond to the
threat you pose to them?
◦ If you intend to create new customers, how will you convince them to reallocate their dollars
toward your product or service (and away from other things they want to purchase)?
◦ In what ways will you communicate with your targeted customers? When will you
communicate with them? What specific messages do you plan to convey to them? How
much will this promotions plan cost?
• Outlines the anticipated responses competitors will have to your entrance into the market, especially if
your success depends upon these businesses losing customers to you
◦ If your entry into the market will not be a threat to direct competitors, it is likely you must
convince potential customers to spend their money with you rather than on what they had
previously earmarked those dollars toward. In your business plan you must demonstrate an
awareness of these issues.
• Often maps out your promotional expenditures according to method used and time frame

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 52

◦ Consider listing the promotional methods in rows on a spreadsheet with the columns
representing weeks or months over probably about 18 months from the time of your first
promotional expenditure. This can end up being a schedule that feeds the costs into your
projected cash flow statement and from there into your projected income statements.
◦ If you phone or visit newspapers, radio stations, or television stations seeking advertising
costs, you must go only after you have figured out details like on which days you would like
to advertise, at what times on those days, whether you want your print advertisements in
color, and what size of print advertisements you want.
◦ Carefully consider which promotional methods you will use. While using a medium like
television may initially sound appealing, it is very expensive unless your ad runs during the
non-prime times. If you think this type of medium might work for you, do a serious costbenefit analysis to be sure.
◦ Some promotional plans are developed around newspaper ads, promotional pamphlets,
printing business cards, and other more obvious mediums of promotion. Be certain to,
include the costs of advertising in telephone directories, sponsoring a little league soccer
team, producing personalized pens and other promotional client give-always, donating items
to charity auctions, printing and mailing client Christmas cards, and doing the many things
businesses find they do on-the-fly. Many businesses find it to be useful to join the local
chamber of commerce and relevant trade organizations with which to network. Some find
that setting a booth up at a trade fair helps launch their business.
◦ If you are concerned you might have missed some of these promotional expenses, or if you
want to have a buffer in place in case you feel some of these opportunities are worthwhile
when they arise, you should add some discretionary money to your promotional budget. A
problem some companies get into is planning out their promotions in advance only to
reallocate some of their newspaper advertisement money, for example, toward some of these
other surprise purposes resulting in less newspaper advertising than had been intended.
Financial Plan
• Contains financial statements
• Also includes
◦ Various funding options and exit strategies for potential investors
◦ Business valuation (be cautious not to over value your business)
◦ Break-even analysis
Business Valuation
There are a multitude of sophisticated business valuation methodologies. A rule of thumb for business valuations

53 • LEE A. SWANSON

is a multiple of its earnings. For example, if the chosen multiple is five and the business’ earnings before taxes
are $55M, the business’ valuation would be approximately $275M.
Break-Even Analysis
Break-Even Point = FC/(P-VC)
• FC = Fixed Costs
• P = Unit Price
• VC = Variable Cost
Example: If the business’ total fixed costs are $1,000,000.00, it costs $5.00 to produce the widget, and the business
sells the widget for $7.00, the break-even point is 500,000 widgets.
• You will most certainly need to make monthly cash flow projections from business inception to
possibly three years out. Your projections will show the months in which the activities shown on your
fixed capital and working capital schedules will occur. This is nearly the only way to clearly estimate
your working capital needs and, specifically, important things like the times when you will need to
draw on or can pay down your operating loans and the months when you will need to take out longerterm loans with which to purchase your fixed assets. Without a tool like this you will be severely
handicapped when talking with bankers about your expected needs. They will want to know how large
of a line of credit you will need and when you anticipate needing to borrow longer-term money. It is
only through doing cash flow projections that you will be able to answer these questions. This
information is also needed to determine things like the changes to your required loan payments and
when you can take owner draws or pay dividends.
• Your projected cash flows are also used to develop your projected income statements and balance
sheets.

Chapter Summary
This chapter described the basic elements of a comprehensive business plan.

Chapter 5 – Making the Business Plan Realistic

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Develop the second draft of the business plan by applying revision methods to improve the
realism of the first draft

Overview
A first draft of a business plan will inevitably be unrealistic for a host of reasons. It is likely to include
contradictions between sections of the written part. The financial and written parts will most likely not align, even
though they must tell the same story, but in different terms. The sales projections might be unrealistic. The cash
flow projections will probably be far from accurate. In general, work will be required to convert the first draft of
the business plan into a realistic second draft.

59 • LEE A. SWANSON

Figure 10 – Making the Business Plan Realistic (Illustration by Lee A. Swanson)

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 60

How to Make the Plan Realistic
Replace Assumptions with Factual and Expert Information
A first step is to replace the assumptions you included in your business plan and flagged with the distinct colored
font (review the Writing the Draft Business Plan section) with information you got from a valid source. Of course,
to establish your and your business plan’s credibility, always include the references to the sources you used.
Review and Revise Sales Projections
Business plan writers should critically review and revise their sales projections while using the strategies below
to improve the realism of the projected financial statements.
When reviewing, and possibly revising sales projections, business plan writers should consider both the sales
projection model they used and the assumptions they fed into the model to generate the monthly sales figures.
Additionally, it is important to compare the resulting projected sales with industry norms and any available
comparative data with similar companies.
Adjust Strategies to Make Projected Financial Statements Realistic
If you used the financial spreadsheet templates as they are meant to be used, you will not have typed a single
number into your projected cash flow statements, your projected income statement, and your projected balance
sheet. You should have entered all of your numbers into a set of schedules that, in turn, automatically transfer the
relevant numbers to the projected statements through formulas.
The cash flow statement estimates all of the money flowing in and out of the venture in each month. The cash
inflows include cash collected from cash sales during the month and accounts receivable collections resulting
from sales made in previous months. They also include proceeds from any assets you sell, loan proceeds, and
other cash investments made into your business.
The cash outflows occur whenever something is purchased, an expense is paid (including loan payments and
taxes), and cash is invested somewhere such that it is no longer available to be used to pay current obligations.
The cash available at the end of each month is the previous month’s cash balance plus all cash inflows minus
all cash outflows (the exception might be the first month when the initial investments—and, possibly, initial
sales—are made, and possibly some expenses are incurred or purchases made). When you complete your first
business plan draft, you will inevitably have unrealistic cash balances at the end of some, if not all months.
You can never have a negative cash balance at the end of a month. If you are projecting negative balances, your
planned venture cannot survive unless you do things like implement strategies to increase projected sales, seek
new investments in your business, and reduce planned operating expenses.
Likewise, an overly high end-of-month cash balance is a signal of possible poor cash management strategies or
overly optimistic sales forecasting. Another consideration if your month ending cash balances are high is whether

61 • LEE A. SWANSON

you have applied realistic assumptions. After all, it is very rare to stumble upon a business opportunity that
generates high amounts of excess cash. If such an opportunity existed, other entrepreneurs would have or will be
poised to enter the market and reduce the appeal of the perceived opportunity.
To eliminate negative cash balances and to manage cash so you don’t have negative or overly positive end-ofmonth cash balances,
1. Determine what range of end-of-month cash balances is realistic for your type of business. For
example, you might decide that, for your type of business, they should always be between $8,000 and
$12,000.
2. Work forward from the first month that the ending balance falls out of that range. To do that, decide
how to best manage your cash. You have several options, including the following (but be certain to
make your changes in the schedules rather than on the projected statements in your financial
spreadsheet templates):
◦ If you are short of cash, you might be able to increase cash inflows. For example, you could
implement strategies (and, of course, include these in the written part of your plan) to
increased projected sales at close to current planned prices, maintain projected sales levels
while increasing prices, attract new investors to inject some cash in the business, use cash
reserves to increase available cash, or to sell an asset that is no longer needed. Of course, you
must be aware of the possible consequences from taking those actions. For example,
increasing prices will lead to lower sales, and if the amount of the price increase is more than
counterbalanced by the drop in sales, you might actually reduce the amount of cash you
generate.
◦ As just noted, new investors can inject cash into the business. For this stage of business plan
development, it is often best to focus on making the business plan realistic without worrying
too much about where to secure the investments you need to start your business beyond the
funding you are reasonably certain that you can get through personal money and from
friends, family, and other ready sources (see the section on Starting Capital). Use this stage
of development to help you determine the amount of money that you will need to secure
from other sources, but adjust your plans and strategies to ensure that the amount of
additional financing that you will need is realistic. It is in the next stage of business
development that you will more seriously consider from what sources you can get the
financing that you determined that you needed while in this stage of development.
◦ If you are short of cash, you might be able to decrease cash outflows by implementing costreduction strategies or reducing or deferring purchases. Again, all of these actions have
consequences you must be aware of. For example, if you reduce your advertising expenses,
you might suffer a large enough decline in sales to worsen your cash shortfall situation.
◦ If your projections show high cash balances in some projected high-sales months, some of
that cash can be transferred to a cash reserve, used to pay down loans, used to purchase

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 62

needed assets or to acquire resources to benefit the business, used to prepay expenses, and
paid to investors as dividends.
◦ If projections show cash balances that are higher than is realistic, you should review your
sales projections and your projected expenses and make any necessary adjustments to make
them more realistic.
If your projected financial spreadsheet templates are set up effectively, your schedules should feed your numbers
into your projected cash flow statement. From there, your projected cash flow statements should automatically
populate your projected income statement and balance sheet.
Test the Realism of Projected Statements Using Financial Analysis Methods
The first steps to improving overall realism is to make your projected cash flow statement more realistic by (1)
replacing as many assumed numbers in your schedules as possible with actual numbers; (2) improving the realism
of your planned strategies and sales and other projections, and (3) adjusting your strategies and plans such that all
month-end cash balances are within a target range. After that, you need to apply financial analysis methods, like
ratio analysis, on the numbers in all of your financial statements to assess the realism of your numbers against
industry standards and similar companies for which financial statements are available. That analysis should lead
to further strategy adjustments to improve the realism of the planned financial positions for your venture during
its first five years of business.
Synchronize the Written and Financial Parts of the Plan
Finally, you will need to rewrite parts of your operations, human resources, and marketing plans—and possibly the
written introduction to your financial plan—to reflect all of the changes you made and to ensure that the written
part of your business plan tells exactly the same story as does the financial part.

Chapter Summary
This chapter addressed the issue of making the first draft of the business plan realistic. To do so, replace as many
of your assumptions as possible with factual and expert information, all properly referenced from valid sources
to build and maintain your and your plan’s credibility. After that, review and revise the original sales projections
to make them more realistic as informed by industry data and available numbers from companies similar to what
you want your venture to be. Revise your strategies until all of the monthly closing balances in your cash flow
statement fall within a realistic, reasonable, and predetermined target range. Perform financial analysis techniques
to test the realism of your projected financial situation. Finally, rewrite your business plan so that the written and
financial sections tell exactly the same story—one using words and the other using numbers.

Chapter 6 – Making the Plan Appeal to Stakeholders
and Desirable to the Entrepreneur

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Develop the third draft of the business plan by applying revision methods to further improve the
realism of the second draft while also making it desirable to the entrepreneur and appealing to
targeted investors
• Describe the funding sources for start-ups

Overview
This chapter deals with adjusting the second business plan draft to retain, and hopefully improve, its realism, while
also making it desirable to the entrepreneur and appealing to targeted investors. In some cases, a business plan
should also be made to appeal to other targeted stakeholders, such as highly skilled employees who are needed,
but who might not be easy to recruit unless they are offered a minority ownership position or receive reassurance
from a well-written business plan.
Securing needed financing is one of the most important functions related to starting a business. This chapter
describes some of the sources of financing available to start-ups.

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 64

65 • LEE A. SWANSON

How to Make the Plan Appealing and Desirable
The second draft of your business plan should include realistic financial projections based on the plans outlined
in the plan. As part of that exercise, you should have projected how much money you will require to start your
business and to operate it over its first five years.
This stage of development focuses on the following tasks:
1. Determine your medium- and longer-term goals for your business as they relate to what you want to
get out of it. As you read through the following questions, consider that the answers you provide
should guide the financing decisions you make now.
◦ Do you want to start your business and rapidly grow its value so you can profit by selling it
within a short period of time to an investor?
◦ Do you plan to operate your business for the rest of your working life? If so, how long will
that be, and what will you do with your business when you want to retire? Will you want to
sell it to an investor for as high a price as you can? Will you want to pass control, and
possibly ownership, to family members? Do you want to retain ownership and hire people to
manage it for you? Might you want to offer ownership interests in your business to your
employees over time so that they will be majority shareholders and will take control of its
operations by the time you retire? What other plans do you have for your business when you
retire?
◦ Do you want to, or will you need to, offer ownership interests in your business to attract
partners or other stakeholders whose help you will need to make it thrive?
◦ What other decisions should you make now to help guide the financing and other choices
you face?
▪ Entrepreneurs must make the decisions required to make their ventures desirable
to them. This includes choosing the right kinds of financing options.
2. Based on your goals for your business and on the amount of financing you require, identify the most
desired sources of financing for your venture. You must consider how much control of your business
you are willing to give up (and when you are willing to give it up), whether you expect to have
adequate cash flow to be able to handle set obligations like loan payments, what financing sources will
enable the growth and value accumulation you desire, and a host of other factors you need to consider
to determine what financing methods will be best for you.
◦ An ideal business plan (1) is realistic in that it can be carried out, (2) clearly lays out plans
that make the projected business outcomes desirable to the entrepreneur, and (3) is crafted
to appeal to targeted investors so that they will provide the amount of money that is needed
at the times it is needed.
3. Incorporate the elements needed in your business plan to attract your targeted investors and make them

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 66

want to invest in your company.
◦ It is not enough to simply identify the most desirable kinds of financing. The planned
business must be structured in a way that entices targeted investors to invest in the business
when the investments are needed. If you are seeking a loan, you must include the loan
payments in the cash flow statement, but you might also need to identify what assets you
have to pledge as security for the loan. If instead you are hoping to attract an angel investor,
you should do some research to identify potential investors who have invested in your kind
of business. Your business plan should then acknowledge the need for an exit strategy for
angel investors and project how that exit strategy can materialize.
4. Identify and analyze your venture’s critical success factors by completing what-if analyses on your
financial spreadsheets. Perform what-if analyses by making copies of your financial spreadsheets and
changing some key numbers, like sales increase projections, to determine what happens if your
projections are off. If your venture is particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of changes to
critical success factors, make needed changes to your goals, strategies, and plans in your business plan
to reduce your vulnerability to critical success factors changes. Or, adjust your goals, strategies, and
plans to prepare for any changes that might occur to the critical success factors.
5. As you do the above, simultaneously adjust your goals, strategies, and plans in the written and
financial projection parts of your plan until (1) you are satisfied that you are prepared to deal with
issues that will affect your critical success factors, and (2) your projected cash flow statements, income
statements, and balance sheets are realistic, consistent with healthy industry norms, and meet realistic
expectations and aspirations for a healthy business.
6. Consider including three sets of projected financial statements in your business plan to reflect the
following scenarios: most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic.

Providing context is essential in making the business plan appeal to various stakeholders.

Financing A Start-up
Starting Capital
Entrepreneurs almost always require starting capital to move their ideas forward to the point where they can start
their ventures. Determining the amount of money that is actually needed is tricky because that requirement can
change as plans evolve. Other challenges include actually securing the amount desired and getting it when it is
needed. If an entrepreneur is unable to secure the required amount or cannot get the funding when needed, they
must develop new plans.

67 • LEE A. SWANSON

Once a venture begins to make cash sales or it starts to receive the money earned through credit sales, it can use
those resources to fund some of its activities. Until then, it must get the money it needs through other sources.
Bootstrap financing is when entrepreneurs use their ingenuity to make their existing resources, including money
and time, stretch as far as possible—usually out of necessity until they can transform their venture into one that
outside investors will find appealing enough to invest in.
Personal Money
Entrepreneurs will almost always have to invest their own personal money into their start-up before others
will give them any financial help. Sometimes entrepreneurs form businesses as partnerships or as multi-owner
corporations with other entrepreneurs who also contribute their own personal funds to the venture.
Love Money
Love money refers to money provided by friends and family who want to support an entrepreneur, often when they
have no other ready source of funding after using as much of their own personal money as possible to support
their start-up.
Grants and Start-up Prize Money
In some cases grants that do not need to be repaid might be provided by government or other agencies to support
new venture start-ups. Sometimes entrepreneurs can enter business planning or similar competitions in which they
might win money and other benefits, like free office or retail space or free legal or accounting services for a set
period of time.
Debt Financing
From an entrepreneur’s perspective, the cost of debt financing is the interest that they pay for the use of the money
that they borrow. From an investor’s perspective, their reward, or return on debt financing, is the interest that they
gain in addition to the return of the money that they lent to an entrepreneur or other borrower.
To provide some protection for the investor (lender) to enable them to accept an interest rate that is also acceptable
for the entrepreneur (borrower), the borrower must often pledge collateral so that, if they do not pay back the loan
along with interest as arranged, the lender has a way to get all or some of the money they are owed. If a borrower
defaults on a loan, the lender can become the owner of the property pledged as collateral. A key objective for an
entrepreneur seeking debt financing is to provide sufficient collateral to get the loan, but to not pledge so much
that they put essential property at risk.
When entrepreneurs borrow money, they must paid it back subject to the terms of the loan. The loan terms include
the specific interest rate that will be charged and the time period within which the loan needs to be repaid. There
are several other terms or features of the loan that can be negotiated between lenders and borrowers. One such
feature is whether the loan can be converted to equity at a particular point in time and according to certain criteria
and subject to specific terms.

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 68

Sometimes debt financing can be in the form of trade credit, where a supplier provides product to a business but
does not require payment for a specific length of time, or perhaps even until the business has sold the product to a
customer. Another form of debt financing is customer advances. This might involve a customer paying in advance
for a product or service so that the business has those funds available to use to pay its suppliers.
Advantages of Debt Financing
One advantage of debt financing is that the entrepreneur does not sacrifice ownership when they take out a loan
and lose some control of their venture.
Another advantage of debt financing is the certainty of the payments the borrower needs to make during the term
of the loan. If the borrower takes out a loan for $20,000 over a 5-year term at a fixed interest rate of 6.2% with a
monthly payment schedule designed to pay off the entire loan by the end of its 5-year term, they know that each
month they must pay $389 and that over the 5 years, they will have paid back the entire $20,000 loan amount plus
a total of $3,340 in interest. With this certainty, the business can accurately budget its payback amount for this
loan over the 5 years.
Yet another advantage of debt financing is that it allows companies to trade on equity. Trading on equity enhances
the rate of return on common shareholders’ equity by using debt to financing asset purchases or to take other
measures that are expected to cost less than the earnings generated by the action taken. For example, if a company
borrows $20,000 at 6.2% interest and uses that money to purchase a machine it will use to increase its return on
equity by 20%, then it is trading on equity. In this case, the company is financially better off than it would be
if it had not taken out the loan. Of course, the inherent risk involved with this strategy is lowered when income
streams are relatively stable.
Disadvantages of Debt Financing
A disadvantage of borrowing money is the need to report to those from whom you borrowed the money. This
might be particularly true when lenders, often bankers, have interests or are subject to incentives that might not
fully align with those of the borrower. For example, a lender will want assurances that they will get all of the
money back that they lent, plus all of the interest owed to them during the term of the loan. A start-up entrepreneur,
however, might struggle to generate the cash flow necessary to pay back all of the money owed according to the
terms of the agreement.
Another disadvantage of borrowing is that the business’s ownership of the property it pledged as collateral for
the loan is placed at risk. For many new ventures, a loan is only possible to acquire if the owner provides their
personal guarantee that the money will be paid back as determined in the loan agreement, thus putting personal
property at risk.
The biggest disadvantage to debt financing for start-up entrepreneurs is that there are a limited number of lenders
who are interested and able to provide loans to businesses during their early stages.

69 • LEE A. SWANSON

Equity Financing
From an entrepreneur’s perspective, the cost of equity financing is the loss of some control over their venture as
they must now share ownership of the business. From an investor’s perspective, their reward for purchasing an
ownership interest in the business is the potential to share in the business’s anticipated future success by possibly
receiving dividends (a portion of the profit that is distributed to owners) and by possibly being able to sell their
ownership interest to another investor (or back to the entrepreneur) for more than the amount they purchased that
ownership interest for originally.
The protection for the investor, who might be a shareholder if the ownership interest is represented in the form
of shares in the business, is in the influence they can exert in the company’s decision-making processes. This
influence is normally proportionate to their share of the ownership in the overall business. Equity investors
normally seek to earn a competitive return on their investment that is in line with the level of risk they assume by
investing in the business. The riskier the investment, the higher the return the investor expects.
The following are some potential sources of equity financing for start-up entrepreneurs.
Equity Crowdfunding
Equity crowdfunding is a relatively new way for entrepreneurs to raise capital. This involves using online methods
to promote equity interests in ventures to potential investors.
Angel Investors
Angel investors are wealthy individuals who on their own or often along with other angel investors in a
network—like the Saskatchewan Capital Network—invest in new ventures in exchange for an ownership interest
in the business. Sometimes angels invest in companies in exchange for convertible debt, an investment that starts
off as a loan, usually in the form of a bond, that they can exercise as an option to convert to an equity interest in
the company at a particular point in time for a pre-determined number of shares. Angel investors are generally less
restricted in what kinds of investments they will consider than are venture capitalists, who are using other people’s
pooled money. Like venture capitalists, however, they normally undertake a rigorous due diligence process to
determine whether to invest in the opportunities they are considering.
Venture Capital
Venture capital is raised when investors pool their money. The venture capital fund is then used to very carefully
invest in existing but usually young companies that are expected to experience high growth. The venture capital
company does not expect to invest for long and it expects to generate a large return. For example, it might expect
to invest in an opportunity for a period of up to five years and then get out of the investment with five times the
money it originally invested. Of course, only some investment opportunities will generate the returns hoped for
and others will return far less than expected.
Venture capitalists might exert some ownership control by influencing some business decisions in cases where
they believe that by doing so they can protect their investment or cause the investment to produce greater returns,

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 70

but they generally prefer to invest in companies that are going to be well-run and will not require them to be
involved in decisions. Venture capitalists might also provide some assistance, such as business advice, to the
companies in which they invest.
A venture round refers to a phase of financing that institutional investors like venture capitalists provide to
entrepreneurs. The first phase (sometimes following a seed round in which entrepreneurs themselves provide
the start-up capital and then an angel round where angel investors invest in the company) is called Series A.
Subsequent venture rounds are called Series B, Series C, and so on.
In general, because venture capitalists normally invest money contributed by investors and have an obligation to
assume a limited amount of risk, they usually do not invest in start-up companies.
Due Diligence
Investors follow due diligence processes to assess the risk and potential return associated with the investments
they are considering. As such, entrepreneurs should maintain a due diligence file that they can quickly draw upon
when a desirable potential investor expresses an interest in their venture.
A due diligence file will include copies of many of the legal papers and other important documents that a
venture has accumulated and that tell the story of the enterprise. These documents will include those related
to incorporation, securities it has issued or is in the process of issuing, loans, important contracts, intellectual
property documents, tax information, financial statements, and other important documentation.
Advantages of Equity Financing
One important benefit to equity financing is that it does not normally require a regular payback from cash flow.
Unlike with debt financing, equity investments do not usually give rise to a regular encumbrance that can increase
the difficulty a young company might have in meeting its regular monthly expenses.
Second, when a firm uses equity financing, it does not need to pledge collateral, which means that the company’s
assets are not placed at risk.
Another potential advantage with equity financing is that, depending upon the form of financing and who the
investors are, a firm might gain valued advisers. In addition, investors who exercise their ownership rights to
have a say in the operations of the company, or who otherwise provide advice and mentorship to entrepreneurs
starting ventures, are usually highly motivated to help the company succeed. Investors expect to benefit only
when the companies they invest in succeed, meaning that their financing incentives are aligned with those of the
entrepreneur and other owners.
Disadvantages of Equity Financing
Equity financing is often more difficult to raise than debt financing. Second, when they share ownership in
exchange for investment into their business, entrepreneurs give up a portion of the value that they create. If things
do not go as planned, entrepreneurs can lose control of their companies to their investors.

71 • LEE A. SWANSON

Overview of Potential Sources of Start-up Financing
• Personal sources (savings and other income) contributed by the business founders
• Extended personal sources (family, friends, employees, partners)
• Strategic partners, including potential customers or potential suppliers who want to have access to a
business like the one proposed (and therefore might fund part of its development). For example, a
building owner (supplier) might help a business develop that it considers to be a desirable tenant.
Another example is when a complementary business, like a hotel, invests in a start-up, like a spa
located next door, that might attract more business.
• Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and other institutions that specialize in supporting
entrepreneurs
◦ BDC calls itself “Canada’s business development bank and the only financial institution
dedicated exclusively to entrepreneurs” (Business Development Bank of Canada, 2016, p.
1).
◦ Among the services provided by BDC is start-up financing for new ventures. They provide
funding for the following:
▪ Working capital to supplement an existing line of credit
▪ Fixed assets
▪ Fund marketing and start-up fees
▪ A franchise purchase
▪ Consulting services
(Business Development Bank of Canada, 2016)
• Angel investors
• Customers (possibly)
◦ They might place orders for services or products and pay for them up-front, thereby
providing financing for the new business
◦ They might want your business to succeed so it can support their business. For example, a
general contractor (future customer) might help a new plumber get started if there is a
shortage of plumbers affecting the building industry in the contractor’s community
• Venture Capitalists (possibly)
◦ These organizations acquire pools of money to invest, so they differ from angel investors in
that those making the decisions are not investing their own money—this means they usually
consider investment options that have shown some success already (which isn’t usually the
case in the start-up phase)

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 72

• Asset-Based Lenders (possibly)
◦ Lend money secured by the assets of the borrower, like the plant and equipment
◦ Sometimes this can be done quite creatively. For example, they might accept assets that will
turn into money—like accounts receivable and inventories—as security to back up a loan.
• Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs)
◦ An American idea developed to bridge the gap between when small businesses need money
and the time when venture capitalists might provide financing to small businesses
◦ SBICs are privately owned companies in the United States that are licensed by the Small
Business Administration (U.S. Government) to supply equity capital, longterm loans, and
management assistance to qualifying small businesses
◦ The Canadian equivalent is the Community Futures Corporations
• Equipment Leasing Companies
• Suppliers through Trade Credit (possibly)
◦ The supplier provides product now without demanding immediate payment
◦ This supplier will provide the product to the retailer on terms so the retailer does not need to
pay the supplier for perhaps 30 or 60 or 90 days
◦ The retailer then can sell the product and collect the money from the customer before the
retailer needs to pay supplier for it
• Factoring (possibly)
◦ When a business sells its accounts receivable (its invoices) to a third party (called a factor) at
a discount in exchange for immediate money
◦ Differs from bank loan in three ways:
▪ The factor is interested in the value of the receivables; a bank is interested in the
firm’s credit worthiness
▪ Factoring is not a loan: it is the purchase of a financial asset (the receivables)
▪ A bank loan involves two parties (lender and borrower); factoring involves three
(the business, the factor, and those who owe the money)

Chapter Summary
After developing a first draft of a business plan, an entrepreneur will inevitably need to make some major
adjustments to the business model and to the plans they developed to make it realistic. After that, the entrepreneur
needs to shift their attention to maintaining and potentially further improving the realism of the plan while making
it desirable to the entrepreneur and appealing to targeted investors. Part of this exercise is deciding upon the best

73 • LEE A. SWANSON

type of financing that is available to the entrepreneur (if any) to ensure that they can meet their longer term goals
for their business. This chapter also described some of the sources of financing available to start-ups.

Chapter 7 – Finishing the Business Plan

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Develop the final draft of the business plan

Overview
The previous stages of business plan development focused on helping the business plan writer (1) start on the plan,
(2) develop a reasonably complete and comprehensive first draft of the plan by focusing on developing the initial
story without obsessing about its realism, (3) convert that into a second draft by adding realism, and (4) develop
a third draft by preserving the realism and making needed changes designed to make the plan appealing to the
entrepreneur and desirable to targeted investors. This stage is where the business plan writer puts the finishing
touches on the plan to prepare it for use.

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 76

First Things Last
Finalize Major Goals
As contradictory as it might sound, it is only after the business plan is almost finished that the Major Goals section
near the start of the plan should be completed. Replace the preliminary goals you have in that section with a
limited set of goals, perhaps five to ten, which perfectly describe the outcomes you projected in certain sections of
your plan. Write goals that will further improve the appeal of your plan for targeted investors and other important
potential readers.
Your major goals should be substantive and relevant. They should also be written using a format designed
to maximize their impact for targeted readers. The RUMBA formula (realistic, understandable, measurable,
believable, and achievable) provides a useful guideline for developing major goals. The following is an example
of a relevant major goal that follows that formula:
We will secure a $56,050 short-term loan in September, 2020, to finance inventory purchases needed to
satisfy our projected increase in Christmas sales that year.
Write your Executive Summary
The last part of your business plan that you should write is the Executive Summary. Unlike most other types of
documents, the executive summary at the start of a business plan can be up to about three pages in length.
As the executive summary might be the first section that targeted readers go through, it must be written to appeal
to them. It should provide those readers with information that will encourage them to seriously consider taking the
desired action, like investing in the venture. If they are not interested by the contents of the executive summary,
they will not likely read any other part of the plan, and they won’t act—usually by investing in the business—as
the business plan writer hopes they will.

Polish it Up!
Thoroughly proofread the completed business plan and fix all errors before submitting it to anyone. It is usually
best to have other people proofread your work as they will catch errors that you will miss.
Never underestimate the negative consequences that can occur from distributing poor quality work.

Write A Letter of Transmittal
A letter of transmittal is to a business plan what a cover letter is to a resume. A letter of transmittal should briefly
introduce the business plan accompanying it to the intended recipient and persuasively, but briefly, communicate
the reasons why they should read it.

77 • LEE A. SWANSON

Chapter Summary
After all of the hard work involved with developing a high-power business plan, it must be finished properly to
have the intended impact with its targeted readers. Before distributing it to targeted investors and other recipients,
a limited number of major goals should be included in the Major Goals section near the start of the plan. Those
goals should be carefully crafted to appeal to intended readers. The final writing task is to develop an executive
summary that will entice targeted readers to examine the rest of the plan in detail for the purpose of deciding
whether to potentially take the action—usually to invest in the venture—desired by the business plan writer. After
that, the plan should be thoroughly proofread and revised to ensure that all errors are eliminated before the plan is
used. After writing a customizedletter of transmittal to introduce the plan, it can be put to use.

Chapter 8 - The Business Plan Pitch

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to
• Deliver an effective business plan pitch

Overview
Writing a good business plan will only get an entrepreneur so far. To achieve their goals, they must be prepared
to pitch their plan effectively to targeted investors and other potential stakeholders. These are sometimes called
elevator pitches because an entrepreneur should be prepared to effectively deliver one in the length of time it
takes to ride up a few floors in an elevator with a potential investor. The goal of a pitch is not to fully describe a
business idea, but to be able to convince a potential investor in five minutes or less that they should meet with the
entrepreneur further to learn more about the idea because they might want to invest in it.

Your business plan pitch must be focused on what your targeted audience and business plan readers need to
know. Usually your pitch will be designed to capture a potential investor’s interest so that they will want to talk to
you about investing in your venture. In that case, your pitch should follow a process similar to the one described
next.
Avoid the trap of telling the potential investors too much about how your business works. Instead, spend your time
telling them what they need to know to become interested enough to possibly invest in your venture. That means
allocating your time almost equally on each of the following elements of your pitch script.
1. Describe the market problem that your venture solves
◦ The problem you solve should be for an identifiable group of people or organizations who
recognize that they have a problem and are willing to spend their money for a solution to the

79 • LEE A. SWANSON

problem.
2. Describe how your venture solves the problem
◦ Your solution should be better than the alternative solutions offered by your competitors or
by those who suffer from the problem. It should also be a solution that cannot or will not be
readily copied by existing or new competitors.
3. Explain how and why you and your venture are capable of solving the problem while also generating a
profit
◦ Your chances of being considered capable of delivering what you promise are enhanced if
you have a strong team, relevant experience, or access to scarce or unique resources or
networks.
4. Explain why you need the financing and anything else you want from the potential investors, like their
expertise or access to their networks
◦ Your opportunities to get the financing you need improve when you can show that the money
will increase your capacity to achieve what you promise.
5. Describe why the investors should invest in your venture
◦ Potential investors want to know how and when they will get their investment back and how
much of a return they will earn on their money. You should be able provide them with an
estimate of how much your venture is worth and will be worth in the future while telling
them what that means for them.

Solving a market problem is a winning formula, so demonstrate how the business solves a problem and makes
money makes for a strong pitch.
Providing context for individual investors and stakeholders is critical for their buy-in.

Chapter Summary
A simple five step business plan pitch format has five steps. When entrepreneurs have a chance to engage with
targeted investors, they usually have a limited amount of time to convince those investors to consider their
investment opportunity. The purpose of the business plan pitch is to capture the attention and interest of targeted
investors within a very short time. A successful pitch should result in an invitation by the investor for the
entrepreneur to provide more information about the business because they might want to invest in it.

Appendix A – Business Plan Development Checklist
and Project Planner

Essential Initial Research
Societal Level
• Apply a PESTEL analysis to learn about the overall factors that might affect your business concept
Industry Level
• Apply a Porter’s (1985) Five Forces Model analysis to examine the particular industry in which you
intend to operate
Market Level
• Apply a market-level analysis by answering a set of questions about the particular market within your
chosen industry in which your business will reside
Firm Level
• Apply a SWOT Analysis/TOWS Matrix to formulate and evaluate potential strategies
• Apply a VRIO Framework Analysis to analyze a firm’s strategy
• Analyze founder fit with venture idea
• To analyze financial attractiveness,
◦ compare estimates for proposed venture to what is known about similar firms in the
particular industry and market in which the venture will operate
◦ analyze the firm’s projected margins (if possible)
◦ do a break-even analysis (if possible)
◦ do a pro forma analysis (if possible; requires pro forma financial statements)

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 82

◦ do a sensitivity analysis (if possible)
◦ do return-on-investment (ROI) projections (if possible)
◦ determine the projected operating capacity of the venture and at how much of that capacity
the firm will operate at certain time intervals until it reaches full capacity (if possible)
◦ if possible and relevant, estimate the share of the market that the venture might capture and
when it might reach various levels of market share
▪ Note: projected operating capacity is often a more relevant concern than market
share

The Business Model
• Use the Business Model Canvas or a similar tool to describe and analyze the proposed venture’s
business model

Initial Business Plan Draft
Create Your Template
• Prepare a template by using the business plan outline to create headings in Word from which to later
automatically generate a table of contents
Insert Work from Essential Initial Research and The Business Model into The Business Plan Draft
There are two ways to include the results from your societal, industry, market, and firm-level analyses in your
business plan. The best choice is usually to disburse the relevant parts of those analyses throughout the entire
plan to support the decisions and strategies outlined in the plan. An alternative choice is to include the results
from all or some of the relevant parts of those analyses as their own sections in the business plan. The first option
tends to strengthen the business plan more than the second because it explicitly ties your analyses to the decisions
influenced by those analyses.
• Integrate the relevant and important results from your societal-, industry-, market-, and firm-level
analyses into your plan, either as distinct sections of the plan or embedded into the other sections to
support the outlined decisions and strategies
• Ensure that all analyses are fully and properly referenced in the business plan to establish and ensure
your and your plan’s credibility as an entrepreneur and to meet ethical requirements to cite the sources
for the information used
• Avoid harming your plan’s credibility by failing to indicate the sources for all of the information you
include. Whenever you make an assumption that you should later replace with a factual or expertlybased statement or number, flag the assumption by using a distinctly coloured font.

83 • LEE A. SWANSON

During the second stage of business plan development, you develop your business model. As no separate section
in a business plan specifically describes a business model, you need to incorporate your business model elements
into the plan wherever they fit best. Where the business model elements fit into a business plan will usually be
fairly self-evident. The important thing is to ensure that all of the elements of your business model are reflected
in your business plan.
• Include each element of your business model in the appropriate parts of your business plan
Fill in All of the Sections of the Business Plan Draft
Draft Introduction
• Write the following sections:
◦ a brief description of your business concept
◦ a brief description of the purpose for your business idea
◦ a brief history and description of the evolution of the business concept
◦ a vision
◦ a mission
◦ a values statements
◦ a first draft set of goals
Draft Operations Plan
• Write an operations plan
• Ensure that all numbers included in the operations plan are
◦ sourced so a reader knows from where it came,
◦ explained so they know how it was calculated, or
◦ flagged as being an estimate that will be replaced with a true number with a source
Draft Human Resources Plan
• Write a human resources plan
• Ensure that you show how you will earn a living while starting the business
• Ensure that all numbers included in the human resources plan are
◦ sourced,
◦ explained, or
◦ flagged as being an estimate that will be replaced with a true number with a source

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 84

Draft Marketing Plan
• Write a marketing plan
• Ensure that all numbers included in the marketing plan are
◦ sourced,
◦ explained, or
◦ flagged as being an estimate that will be replaced with a true number with a source
Draft Financial Plan
• Plan how you will back up every number through one or both of the following:
◦ Explanations in the body of your plan, maybe along with your schedules, or
◦ Notes included with your financial statements
• Only insert a number for a particular item once and flag this cell
◦ Very few numbers in your projected financial statements should be input directly and each
directly inputted number should be flagged using cell shading or another means so it is easier
to fix any errors in the statements.
• Whenever a number is required more than once, ensure it transfers forward by formula only
• Prepare all of the following schedules (if applicable) that you will need to feed numbers into your
projected cash flow statements:
◦ Sales schedule, if you will sell more than one product
◦ Project schedule
◦ Cash from sales schedule, cash from receivables schedule, and accounts receivable schedule
◦ Cash purchase schedule, credit purchase schedule, and accounts payable schedule
◦ Credit card collections schedule, if you will need to calculate your costs for accepting credit
card payments from customers (you can normally consider credit card payments as cash
payments in your cash flow statement)
◦ Inventory schedules
◦ Start-up cost schedule
◦ Capital cost allowance schedule or depreciation schedule
◦ Payroll schedule
◦ Operating loan schedule
◦ Term loan schedule, especially if you may make extra payments toward it before the term
expires

85 • LEE A. SWANSON

◦ Promotions schedule, if you expect to use several promotional methods
◦ Prepayment schedule, if you expect to prepay insurance and similar expenses
◦ Other schedules that are needed
• Prepare projected cash flow statements
• Input the numbers from your schedules by formula into the projected cash flow statements. You might
also discover the need to develop a schedule after you have first tried inputting the numbers directly
into the projected cash flow statements.
• Ensure that the written part and the financial part tell exactly the same story using the exact same
numbers and sources.
◦ Note: you will almost certainly have to estimate some numbers while preparing the projected
cash flows. Immediately upon estimating the numbers, go to the written part of your plan
and include them there.
• Prepare your projected income statements and projected balance sheets by formula only
• Calculate your taxes owing and feed these back into your projected cash flow statement
• Calculate your retained earnings
• Correct your statements until your balance sheet balances

Making the Business Plan Realistic
At this stage, your projected financial statements in your draft business plan are almost guaranteed to be
unrealistic and undesirable. Your projected cash balances and profit levels will be unrealistic, either too high or
too low. The original amounts you had planned to invest in your business or to acquire through investors will
probably be inadequate. In general, your draft plan will have many weak areas and many holes to fill, but it should
provide you with a great foundation upon which to build a realistic and desirable business plan.
The purpose of this stage is to make your business realistic. You do this by adjusting your proposed business
model and your plans and strategies as presented in both the written and financial parts of your plan.
• Replace as many of the assumptions (those items flagged with a distinctly coloured font) as possible
with factual and expert information and numbers while always indicating the sources for the new
information and numbers
• Review and revise the sales projections to make them more realistic by comparing the projections to
industry norms and available comparative data with similar companies. Review and revise as
necessary both the sales projections model used and the assumptions fed into the model to generate the
monthly sales figures.
• Decide what the appropriate range of end-of-month cash balances is for your type of business
• Eliminate any negative end-of-month cash balances by taking steps to turn each of these into positive

numbers that fall within your target range by adjusting one or more of the following:
◦ Planned loan amounts (operating and/or term loan amounts)
◦ Planned owner investment amounts (or draw from built-up investment accounts)
◦ Planned amounts in schedules (increase prices, increase sales amounts, decrease expenses)
• An excessive cash balance at the end of a month indicates poor cash management practices. Eliminate
any excessive end-of-month cash balances by reducing each of these numbers so they fall within your
target range by doing one or more of the following:
◦ Use the excess money to generate more profits (expand your business, purchase an asset you
need, etc.)
◦ Use the excess money to pay down operating loans (and possibly term loans)
◦ Invest the excess money in financial investments
◦ Distribute some of the cash as dividends or owner draws
◦ Adjust planned amounts in schedules (decrease prices, decrease sales amounts, increase
expenses)
• Simultaneously adjust your goals, strategies, and plans in your written and financial projections of
your plan to make your projected financial statements realistic
• Analyze your projected financial statements and develop plans to correct the elements that are
unrealistic and undesirable
◦ For example, if your planned start-up financing is too high to be realistic, you might choose
to downscale some elements
▪ On the expense side, you might plan to start with a smaller facility, fewer
employees, less inventory, and different advertising methods. On the revenue side,
you might project lower sales because of your smaller facility, fewer employees,
and so on.
▪ You might also plan to finance some of your expansion through retained earnings
rather than by taking out a large initial loan or by giving up a higher amount of
ownership to an investor.
• Continually adjust the written and financial sections of your draft plan to reflect your new goals,
strategies, and plans. This will be an iterative process since everything is connected and each change
will have a ripple effect throughout your plan.
• Adjust the amounts in your schedules to reflect your planned changes (increase prices, increase sales
amounts, decrease expenses)
• Use a series of ratio analyses as you incorporate your new goals, strategies, and plans
• Continually compare your ratios to industry average ratios

• Continually compare your ratios to what is expected and desirable for a business like yours
• Continually adjust the written and the financial parts of your plan until your ratios are desirable and
realistic relative to industry standards

Making the Business Plan Appeal to Stakeholders and Desirable to the Entrepreneur
You should now have a second full draft of your business plan. It should be much more realistic than your first
draft, but is it unlikely to be desirable to you as an owner or appealing to your potential investors. The purpose of
this stage is to retain, and possibly improve, the realism of your plan while making it desirable and appealing.
• Determine your medium- and longer- term goals for your business as they relate to what you want to
get out of it
◦ Based on your goals and on the amount of financing you require, identify the most desired
sources of financing for your venture and incorporate those into your plan to indicate how
you will meet your financing needs
• As you fulfill the following requirements, incorporate all of the needed elements in your business plan
to attract your targeted investors and make them want to invest in your company
• As you identify and analyze your critical success factors by completing what-if analyses on your
financial spreadsheets, continue to simultaneously adjust your goals, strategies, and plans in your
written and financial projections until
◦ you are satisfied that you are prepared to deal with issues that will affect your critical success
factors, and
◦ your projected cash flow statements, income statements, and balance sheets are realistic,
consistent with healthy industry norms, and meet realistic expectations and aspirations for a
healthy business
• Use a copy of your spreadsheets and change some key numbers to see what happens
◦ For example, you might discover that you are particularly vulnerable if your sales end up
being less than you had expected (and/or challenged if sales end up being higher than
expected). Sales levels, then, is one critical success factor.
• Determine what the impact would be on your business if the critical success factors are impacted in a
way you had not planned on
◦ For example, when you examine sales as a critical success factor, you might discover that if
sales are 3% less than you had planned (maybe because of an economic downturn or the
emergence of a new competitor), your entire profits evaporate
◦ It might also be true that you will run into cash flow or capacity problems if your sales end
up being higher than you are planning for
• Decide whether you need to make adjustments to your goals, strategies, and plans in your business

BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT GUIDE • 88

plan to reduce your vulnerability to changes to the critical success factors, or whether you can instead
adjust your goals, strategies, and plans to prepare for any changes that might occur to the critical
success factors
◦ For example, you might decide to change the pricing, distribution, and promotions strategies
in your business plan so that you would still break even if your sales levels were 8% less
than expected
◦ Alternatively, instead of changing your marketing strategy in your plan, you could describe
sales levels as a critical success factor and include a description of how and at what point
you will implement another strategy if sales levels are not as expected, and describe what
your strategy is
• Decide how to present your analysis of your critical success factors
• If appropriate for your business, you can include three sets of projected financial statements in your
business plan: most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic

Finishing the Business Plan
• Revise your goals section to ensure the included goals will best meet your purposes and will resonate
with your target readers
◦ Note: your goals will have changed dramatically between when you first wrote them and
how they should look once the plan is completed. Although not required, it can be effective
to follow each goal with a note about where in the plan your strategies are located for
achieving that goal.
• Write your executive summary
• Proofread to ensure that the written and financial parts of the plan are completely consistent
• Proofread to remove spelling, grammar, formatting, calculation, or other errors
◦ If required, have a skilled proofreader complete this task for you or with you
• Write a letter of transmittal and later customize it for targeted readers

Prepare to Pitch and Present your Business Plan
• Prepare and practice your pitch. Be clear on why you are pitching your plan and customize it to meet
those goals
• Prepare a presentation using a tool like PowerPoint to use if you are asked to more formally present
your plan
• Always have business cards with you to give to those who express an interest in your business and
who you want to connect with later
