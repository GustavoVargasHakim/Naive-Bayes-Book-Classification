Introduction by the Authors
This book is provided on the worldwide web as a service to the community of
practitioners and students. While we believe that the material in the book could find a
commercial publisher and a market, we feel that free of charge availability will expand
the impact of the material and help improve the practice of infrastructure management.
By ‘free of charge,’ we mean that the material can be freely obtained, but readers
should devote time and effort to mastering the material. We have provided problem
assignments for various chapters, and we strongly urge readers to undertake the
problems as a learning experience.
Reproduction for educational purposes is permitted with appropriate citation:
Coffelt, Donald and Chris Hendrickson. Fundamentals of Infrastructure Management.
2017. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. https://doi.org/10.1184/R1/5334379.v1
If you find this work helpful or have suggestions for additions or corrections, please
email one of the authors: Don Coffelt (dcoffelt@andrew.cmu.edu) or Chris Hendrickson:
(cth@cmu.edu ). We plan to update the book periodically in the future, although our
focus is on fundamental concepts that don’t change rapidly over time.
This book grew out of a decade of co-teaching a course entitled ‘Infrastructure
Management’ at Carnegie Mellon University. Our teaching philosophy was to prepare
students for work in the field of infrastructure management. We believe that
infrastructure management is a professional endeavor and an attractive professional
career. Don is a good example of infrastructure management career opportunities. He
currently serves as Associate Vice-President for Facilities Management and Campus
Services at Carnegie Mellon University, responsible for providing facilities leadership to
350 personnel supporting a campus covering 150 acres and including more than 6M
square feet of buildings and associated transportation and utility distribution systems.
Don’s $100M annual program includes infrastructure planning & management, utility
operations, parking, facility operations and various support services.
Of course, there is also a role for infrastructure management research. Both of the coauthors have research interests (and a number of research publications) on various
topics of infrastructure management. However, the primary audience for this book is
intended to be professionals intending to practice infrastructure management, and only
secondarily, individuals who intend to pursue a career of research in the area.
We draw examples and discuss a wide variety of infrastructure systems in this book,
including roadways, telecommunications, power generation, buildings and systems of
infrastructure. We have found that some common fundamentals of asset management,
analysis tools and informed decision making are useful for a variety of such systems.
Certainly, many infrastructure managers encounter a variety of infrastructure types
x

during their professional careers. Moreover, due to the functional inter-dependencies of
different infrastructure systems, it is certainly advantageous for managers of one
infrastructure type to understand other types of infrastructure. For example, roadway
managers rely upon the power grid for traffic signal operation.
The first segment of this book presents fundamental concepts and processes, followed
by chapters on specific types of infrastructure. In the first segment of the book, we
generally use roadways as an example infrastructure application but not exclusively.
We have chosen roadways since they are ubiquitous and nearly everyone is familiar
with their use (and deterioration!).
We are convinced that a life cycle or long-term viewpoint is essential for good
infrastructure management. There are always pressures to adopt short term thinking in
making investment and management decisions. Political election cycles and short-term
stock performance certainly focus attention on immediate priorities or issues.
Nevertheless, many infrastructure investments will last for decades or more, and
providing good performance over an entire lifetime is critical for good infrastructure
management. Even virtual decisions such as the adoption of a particular performance
standard for a facility component are likely to have long-term implications.
Of course, infrastructure managers may face budget limits or other constraints that
preclude long-term optimization. A result is the deferred maintenance and functional
obsolescence that exist in many infrastructure systems. However, understanding the
effects and implications of these constraints is an important task for infrastructure
managers.
As a fourth organizational concept, we believe that infrastructure management in a
process with multiple objectives (as well as multiple constraints). In particular,
infrastructure management should adopt a ‘triple bottom line’ to consider economic,
environmental and social impacts. Again, infrastructure managers may be charged with
focusing solely on costs of providing services, but infrastructure certainly has
implications for the natural environment and for society. For example, infrastructure
management typically involves a large number of workers and affects a large number of
users, so social impacts are significant. Throughout this book, we will try to address
the impacts of infrastructure decision making with regard to these multiple objectives.
Students in our Infrastructure Management were usually first year graduate students or
senior undergraduate students. While most were majoring in engineering disciplines,
we also had architects, computer scientists and public policy students successfully
complete the course. Indeed, many of our students ended up pursuing a career in
some form of infrastructure management, and we are particularly grateful to all our
students for their insights, their questions and their feedback on the material.

xi

Our course in Infrastructure Management was a full semester with class sessions for 30
to 35 hours over the course of a semester. The order of coverage of material generally
followed the order in this book, except that we usually covered one or two infrastructure
chapters early in the course to provide context for examples. The course involved class
sessions (with a mix of lecture, discussion, videos and in-class exercises), homework
assignments and a group project of the student’s choosing. Our textbooks ranged from
peer reviewed journal papers to the literal infrastructure “news of the day”. We also
invited a few practicing infrastructure managers to guest lecture on their own their own
activities, problems and successes as practitioners in this sub-discipline. We always
included a tour of campus infrastructure, visiting utility tunnels, roof tops, and
mechanical rooms – spaces not generally open to students.
An online Instructor's Manual with problem solutions and project assignments is
available to genuine instructors. Instructors should email Don Coffelt
(dcoffelt@andrew.cmu.edu) or Chris Hendrickson (cth@cmu.edu) with their course
details for a digital copy of the Instructor’s Manual.
This book has three companion books available on the World Wide Web. Each of these
other books grew out of semester long courses at Carnegie Mellon University and may
be of interest to some readers. The companion books are:
1. Hendrickson, Chris, ‘Project Management for Construction,’
http://pmbook.ce.cmu.edu/. This book discusses the fundamentals of project
organization, cost estimation, financing, cost control, and quality control.
Construction processes are also described. While this book uses
construction examples and processes, many of the fundamental methods can
be used for other types of projects, including software engineering.

2. Civil Infrastructure Planning, Investment and Pricing (co-authored by Chris
Hendrickson and H. Scott Matthews). Again, either search for the book title
or look at the website: http://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/textbooks/cspbook/). This
book covers the fundamentals of infrastructure demand and usage, private
and social benefits, infrastructure cost functions and pricing strategies. The
material has a large overlap with economic benefit/cost analysis, but the
focus is upon additional objectives than cost minimization and applications
are made to infrastructure decisions.

1.1 Importance of Infrastructure
Human society depends crucially upon a series of infrastructure investments that have
been made over centuries of time. We have constructed water, wastewater and power
systems, as well as buildings, roads, ports, railways and other facilities. More recently,
we have built complex telecommunication systems. In the process, humans have
profoundly altered natural landscapes and ecological systems. The result has been a
large number of inter-dependent infrastructure systems to support economic activity and
social welfare. Without our infrastructure, society would not function in anything like its
current state. We all have come to depend upon electricity from our power grid, goods
delivered from our transportation systems, clean water from municipal water supplies
and sewage services. In effect, infrastructure investment is a major social commitment,
but it enables a great variety of economic and social activities.
With our dependence upon infrastructure, it is not surprising that the management of
our infrastructure is a critical economic and social task. Infrastructure wears out during
use, deteriorates over time due to aging and weather effects, and can fail due to
extreme stress from event such as earthquakes or floods. Maintaining, rehabilitating
and renewing our infrastructure systems are a major undertaking for any society.

There is no widely accepted enumeration of the number and extent of infrastructure
systems. Some analyses focus solely on publicly owned infrastructure, but this omits
major systems in many countries, such as railroads in the United States. The American
Society of Civil Engineers provides ‘grades’ of the condition of 16 different types of US
infrastructure (ASCE, 2016), while the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s
National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies 18 types of infrastructure (DHS, 2016).
The National Resource Council defines five ‘critical infrastructure systems:’ power,
water, wastewater, telecommunications and transportation systems (NRC 2009).
Defining the extent of infrastructure is difficult also due to the complexity of
components within any type of infrastructure. For example, roadways have a variety of
constituent infrastructure systems themselves, including:
•
•
•
•
•

Pavements and pavement markings;
Tunnels and bridges;
Drainage and foundation support;
Sidewalks and
Signage and traffic control infrastructure.

2

Each of these roadway components can be treated as its own infrastructure system to
be managed. Similarly, buildings have a variety of sub-components and systems to be
managed.
For the purposes of this book, we will take a broad view of infrastructure
systems, including both critical and mundane facilities and components. Infrastructure
managers will certainly vary in the extent of their interests and management
responsibilities, so taking a broad viewpoint on what constitutes infrastructure is
appropriate.

1.2 Goals for Infrastructure Management
Just as the number and extent of infrastructure systems are complex, so are the goals
that are pursued for any particular infrastructure system. One common goal suggested
is to insure ‘sustainable’ infrastructure. One interpretation of sustainable is simply to
have facilities with great longevity. However, this is often not a realistic goal. First,
managers must be sensitive to the amount of resources required to construct and
maintain any particular facility. Longevity requires greater capital investment for initial
construction. Second, the requirements for facilities are likely to change over time. For
example, the legal size and weight of trucks can change over time (usually with an
increase), which may make existing bridges functionally obsolete since they cannot
support larger trucks. Third, the usage of facilities may decline to such an extent that
maintaining an existing facility is not beneficial.
For most infrastructure systems, managers adopt a planning horizon for longevity
decision making. Such planning horizons can vary from a short period (such as a year
or two) to decades (for infrastructure such as ports or buildings). Each organization
involved in infrastructure management may have their own planning horizon for such
decision making.
In practice, the goals for infrastructure management are complex and multiple. Most
critically, facilities are expected to provide acceptable performance to a variety of users.
For example, a local roadway might accommodate a variety of motorized vehicles (such
as buses, cars and trucks - moving or parked), bicycles and pedestrians (particularly at
intersections). Deterioration of the facility can affect acceptable performance, as with
the development of potholes, uneven surfaces and cracking for pavement. Extreme
events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding or terrorist activities can require
immediate attention and response.

Typically, goals for infrastructure management can be categorized as economic,
environmental and social. Economic impacts include the direct and indirect costs of
managing and operating the infrastructure system, the economic development potential
for the system (including employment) and any user or non-user benefits stemming
from the system. Environmental impacts are associated with ecological system uses,
emissions to the environment (especially toxic chemicals and greenhouse gas
emissions), and non-renewable resource use. Social impacts pertain to equity of
benefits, social justice and individual development (including employment). This ‘Triple
Bottom Line’ of goals is common for many social investments.

1.3 Role of Infrastructure Managers
Infrastructure managers are becoming increasingly important in the agencies and
owners of infrastructure. Throughout the world, centuries of infrastructure investment
have resulted in complex, multi-layered systems of existing infrastructure. Maintaining
this infrastructure investment is a major task as noted above.
The skills required of infrastructure managers will vary from place to place but have
some common elements. Managerial skills for setting priorities, communication with
multiple stakeholders, building effective teams and proactive problem solving are
always desirable. Technical familiarity with information systems and infrastructure
systems is highly desirable, although managers can often rely upon their management
team for relevant technical expertise. Developing rapid and effective responses to
component breakdowns and extreme events such as floods or earthquakes is also a
major role for infrastructure managers.

5

The background and career paths of infrastructure managers can also vary.
Traditionally, many managers rose through the ranks of skilled tradesmen such as
mechanics or construction workers. More recently, professional backgrounds in
architecture, engineering, or business have become more heavily represented among
infrastructure managers. With any background, it is imperative for infrastructure
managers to stay current with new technologies and issues affecting their work.
Rather than a holistic overview for infrastructure management, many managers are
charged with responsibility for single components or even single attributes of
components. For example, Infrastructure systems along a neighborhood street might
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Roadway pavement
Electricity
Tele-communications
Potable Water
Natural Gas
Wastewater Sewer
Storm Sewer

Each of these systems may have separate owner organizations and managers. One
system might have multiple managers. For example, the roadway pavement may have
different managers for snow removal, routine cleaning and rehabilitation and
maintenance. As might be imagined, co-ordination in the management of these
different systems may be difficult. The infrastructure managers involved should make
special efforts to insure information sharing and co-ordination. For example, roadway
rehabilitation could be usefully coordinated with work on other underground utilities to
avoid repeated excavations.

1.4 Organizations for Infrastructure Management
A variety of industrial and professional organizations have emerged to provide a forum
for infrastructure managers and indeed to support the notion that the discipline itself
represents a discrete field of study within the engineering profession. These
organizations provide a means of spreading relevant information, such as best practices
and job availability. However, these organizations often are limited to particular types of
infrastructure or specific regions or countries. A partial list of related professional
organizations associated with the practice of infrastructure management in the United
States is listed below:

2.1 Introduction
Actively managed infrastructure systems typically have a structured process for asset
management. Such processes are usually planned for regular time intervals such as
annually or every five years. Asset management does require resources of various
types. But with an asset management process, owners can reduce the risk of
unexpected infrastructure failures and plan for preventive maintenance to reduce
lifetime infrastructure costs.
In many cases, owners are required to have an asset management process in place by
lenders or regulators. In such cases, the lenders or regulators may be interested in
estimates of the value of infrastructure assets in addition to appropriate management
actions. An example is the standards recommended by the Government Accounting
Standards Board (FHWA 2000). Since sale of infrastructure assets happen only
sporadically, the ‘value’ of infrastructure is usually estimated as either the original
acquisition or construction cost less depreciation over time, the cost of replacement, or
the cost of preservation for the infrastructure.
Depreciation is an accounting term that represents a loss in value over time and is
usually considered a cost of business. For many infrastructure systems, depreciation is
calculated as a linear loss of value over the expected lifetime of the system. So if the
original construction cost was C, the expected lifetime is n years, then the depreciation
in each year is C/n and the estimated value of the system in year t (counting from the
time the infrastructure is constructed or acquired) is C – t*(C/n). For example, if C is $
10 million, n is 50 years, depreciation in each year is $ 10,000,000/50 = $ 200,000 and
the ‘value’ in year 10 is $ 10,000,000 - 10*$200,000 = $ 8,000,000.
While we focus on infrastructure assets here, assets to a particular enterprise will often
comprise a wide range of resources. Employees are assets whose value can improve
with experience, education or training. Likewise, inventories of goods and real estate
are assets. Even reputations are viewed as assets and can be subject to an asset
management process.

9

2.2 Usual Elements of an Asset Management Process
Figure 2.1 illustrates the typical steps in an asset management process. These steps
would often be undertaken on an annual basis, although many of the elements might
not change from year to year such as goals and policies. In the remainder of this
section, we will comment upon the various components in the generic asset
management systems in Fig. 2.1. Later chapters will examine these process steps in
greater detail.

Goals and policies will differ among enterprises. For example, a water provider (e.g.,
a water utility) might have goals to provide a certain quantity of water within defined
quality standards. Further, the water provider might have goals to preserve its physical
infrastructure at a certain quality standard. A major difference in policies concerns
corporate taxation. For private corporate owned assets, the tax implications of
depreciation and maintenance expenses may be important in the overall profitability of
the corporation. Infrastructure managers must assess the specific goals and policies
pertaining to their own enterprise.
Asset inventory identifies the numbers and types of assets available. For example, a
roadway agency might keep track of the numbers and types of roads in their system,
but also assets such as road signs and lane markings. Inventory is often hampered by
the absence or loss of historic records, such as the exact locations of old underground
pipes. Inventory changes over time as assets are created (through construction or
purchase) or disposed (through retirement or sale).
Computer aids are available for asset inventory. For fixed in place assets, geographic
information systems may be quite helpful, showing the location and types of assets
visually on a computer screen (Figure 2.2 provides an example of such a GIS
inventory). For these aids, a standardized labelling or numbering system for assets is
required. These identifiers are usually stored in an inventory database of asset
information, but also installed on pieces of infrastructure themselves. For example,
railway cars will have a standardized ‘reporting mark’ to indicate the owner of the car
and its number. The identifiers may be written on the assets or stored in readable
digital form by technologies such as radio frequency identifier (RFID) tags or bar codes.
In many cases, computer aids pertain to individual assets such as bridges or roadway
segments, and some form of ‘data gateway’ may be required to provide a holistic view
of enterprise assets.

Angeles and San Francisco.

Condition Assessment and Performance Modelling requires an assessment of the
current functionality of each asset and often involves a forecast of asset deterioration.
Condition assessment can be done mechanistically by assuming a standard
deterioration with use and time, but more often involves active survey and/or sensing
along with models of performance and deterioration. In many cases, condition
assessment is summarized in a numerical rating score based on survey, sensing or
12

testing. Figure 2.3 shows a pavement segment having less than perfect condition as an
example.

m#fig92.

Alternatives Evaluation and Program Optimization is a process step to plan asset
maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement for the planning horizon. In this step,
managers need to formulate reasonable alternatives for asset improvement. For a
roadway segment, alternatives might include various maintenance activities (such as
crack sealing or pothole patching), repaving (such as milling off the top layer of asphalt
and placing a layer of smooth, recycled asphalt), or reconstruction. Of course, any
asset management plan will have to be modified over time in response to changing
conditions or priorities.
Computer aids can also be useful in the process of alternatives evaluation and program
optimization. Databases of possible alternative actions (and their costs and other
characteristics) are helpful. Optimization programs to minimize costs may be employed.
Alternatives evaluation can also involve multiple stages, with preliminary investigation
followed by detailed analysis of a final set of possible actions.
Budget and Allocations define the resources available for asset management and will
influence selection of management alternatives. In effect, most infrastructure managers
are constrained by the allocation of resources and budgets available in any particular
period. As shown in Figure 2.1, budget and allocations may also influence the goals
and policies defined for the entire process.
Short and Long Range Plans (Project Selection) develops a plan of action for
selected alternatives over periods of time. ‘Short range’ typically is a yearlong planning

13

horizon, although it might be as short as scheduling activities over the course of a day
or week. Long range plans usually involve major projects and may involve a significant
planning process. For discussion of long range planning, see Hendrickson (2016).
Plans usually involve the infrastructure management organization itself, but often
include provisions to contract out for specific projects.
A component of most infrastructure management short range plans is a process for
responding to routine maintenance requests. For example, a building manager might
have a systematic plan for replacing light bulbs in the building, but would also respond
to reports of burnt out or broken lights.
Program Implementation is the process of actually completing the selected projects.
For example, a City might plan to repave 200 kilometers of designated roadway
segments over the course of a construction season. Program implementation involves
actually doing the repaving work.
Performance Monitoring (Feedback) is a means of providing continuous feedback
information on asset management performance. While Fig. 2.1 shows this feedback as
a flow into goals and policies, the feedback can influence all stages of the asset
management process. For example, the performance of particular maintenance or
rehabilitation alternatives may inform alternatives evaluation and project selection.
Performance monitoring often involves measures of infrastructure usage and quality of
services provided in addition to direct information on asset management actions.

2.3 Example Asset Management System: Commercial Roof Management
Commercial roofs represent a substantial asset that is often subject to an asset
management process. Of course, roofs would only be one component of a building
asset management process, but since roofs have special design characteristics,
construction and maintenance, they often receive special attention. Figure 2.4
illustrates the various components of a typical low slope commercial roof. A reflective
cap for energy conservation is the top layer, with a waterproof membrane, insulation
(varying in thickness with design decisions relative to the local climate) and a roof deck
below.

14

Figure 2.4 - Typical Low Slope Roof Cross Section

Source: Coffelt and Hendrickson, 2010

The goal of managing commercial roofs is often long term (or life cycle) cost
minimization. In addition to roof maintenance and replacement costs, this cost
minimization should consider user costs either directly or as a constraint (such as
perform maintenance or replace if leaks begin to occur). A direct forecast of user costs
would require assessment of the costs associated with roof failures (notably leaks)
multiplied by the probability of such failures (Coffelt and Hendrickson 2010 and 2011).
Introducing other goals for use of roof space or water retention might motivate adoption
of different roof types, such as green roofs with a soil and plant layer (Blackhurst 2010).
Inventory of roofs is based upon building blueprints, maps, and inspection. A database
record of a building roof characteristics and records is illustrated in Figure 2.5. The area
of the roof is recorded as well as roof characteristics. The location of the roof can be
found from the (unique) building name.
In this case, the roof has a record of manual inspections roughly every six months from
1997 to 2005. The inspection rated the condition of the overall roof, the membrane, the
roof support and flashing using a five point rating scale from 1 (new) to 5 (failed).
Flashing is a metal strip to prevent water intrusion between a roof and another
component such as a vent. In addition to roof inspection and rating, the biannual
inspection can be used to perform minor maintenance such as clearing debris on the
roof. Note that the roof was generally deteriorating in years 1997 to 2001, and then
was in stable condition after the replacement of the old roof.

In any particular year, the roof asset manager would review the roof condition, forecast
roof conditions and costs for the next year or so, formulate alternatives (such as replace
the roof or perform maintenance as recorded in the data record) and make decisions
about treatments to the roof.
Performance monitoring could also be accomplished annually as the roof asset
manager evaluates last year’s decisions.
Roof asset management has the advantage of reducing the risk of catastrophic losses
that might occur with sudden roof failure. By systematically rating conditions and
considering management alternatives, the roof asset manager avoids such failures. Of
course, natural hazards such as tornados or hurricanes might still result in roof failures,
but even there design decisions such as tying roofs down can reduce the risk of failure.

16

2.4 Asset Condition, Level of Service and Performance
Asset management systems can focus upon improving condition, performance (often
called level of service) or some combination of these characteristics. For infrastructure
asset management, condition relates to the functionality of a particular infrastructure
component and its deterioration process. Performance and level of service refer to the
user experience and use of the infrastructure itself. Performance and level of service
can also be defined and measured for processes that are not infrastructure, such as
patient waiting time on visiting a hospital emergency room. Facilities management
processes can also have process performance measures, such as response time and
communications adequacy to repair requests.
Figure 2.6 illustrates levels of service for four different transportation modes as originally
defined by the Florida Department of Transportation. Automobile level of service is
usually defined by the volume of traffic relative to the roadway capacity. As volume
increases, congestion and delay also increase with a progression from level of service A
(free flow traffic) to F (traffic jam). For bicycles, the level of service is defined by the
separation from the dangerous vehicular traffic stream. For pedestrians, sidewalk
amenities, provision of sidewalks and separation from vehicular traffic influence level of
service. For buses, level of service is defined with respect to frequency of service and
crowding on the buses.

17

Individual components of infrastructure systems can also have level of service and
performance measures. Figure 2.7 shows the levels of service for intersections with
traffic signals defined by the California Department of Transportation. In this case, the
level of service and performance is related to the average delay per vehicle at the
intersection. Note that the factors affecting level of service relate to the intersection
infrastructure (such as traffic signal and geometric conditions) as well as the traffic
volumes (such as numbers of pedestrians and trucks).

Infrastructure performance can be a multi-dimensional consideration. For example,
telephone service performance includes aspects of coverage (for cellular phones),
dropped calls (again for cellular phones), sound quality and user costs.
For nearly all infrastructure systems, performance and level of service depend upon the
infrastructure condition. For example, unreliable cellular telephone routers will degrade
the service performance. Leaky roofs are both a condition and a user problem. Rough
and potholed roadway surfaces reduce the speed of traffic flow even at low traffic
volumes. Moreover, the infrastructure conditions can be influenced directly by
maintenance or rehabilitation activities initiated by an infrastructure manager, so
condition of infrastructure is often emphasized in infrastructure asset management.
The measures of infrastructure performance differ from system to system. Some typical
performance measures would include:

Asset condition assessed in processes of inspection and modelling of
deterioration. Index scales are often used to summarize condition as described
in later chapters.
Asset value is closely tied to condition as well as use.
Cost for both owners and users of the infrastructure. Owner costs include
maintenance, operations and rehabilitation. User costs include waiting or delay
times.
Customer service related to communications and response to requests.
Safety measured by the numbers and extent of injuries or risks.
Reliability measured by the availability of infrastructure services both in normal
service and in extreme events such as hurricanes.
Sustainability related to overall economic impact of the infrastructure,
environmental emissions and resource consumption, and social impacts.

Fortunately, infrastructure managers can generally use organizational or wellestablished metrics of performance for asset management. Obtaining user costs can
be more difficult, and may require special data collection efforts or surveys. For
example, traveler delays on roadways may be assessed by measuring the speed of
vehicles travelling over the network.
In later chapters, we will discuss the individual processes and approaches to condition
assessment and infrastructure performance.

3.1 Introduction
As discussed in Chapter 2 Asset Management, asset component inventory and
condition assessment are important steps in any infrastructure management process.
They provide essential information for maintenance and rehabilitation decision making.
For immobile and long lasting physical assets with explicit geophysical locations,
inventory can be relatively simple. Data records for asset location, size, age and other
pertinent information can be created. As new assets are added or retired, the data
records need to be updated, either as transactions occur or on a periodic basis.
Computerized asset facilities management (CAFM) systems and computerized
maintenance management systems (CMMS) systems with or without mapping capability
are often useful for these inventories.
For linear and network physical assets (e.g., pipelines, electrical distribution systems,
etc.) inventory is increasing complex. Like fixed location systems, data records can be
created and updated; however, accurate inventories for the systems are specifically
dependent on management systems with geospatial capabilities (e.g., geographic
information systems (GIS)) that include a mapping capability so that these assets can
be displayed on a two, or even three dimensional map.
Mobile assets may be more difficult to inventory since their locations might not be
known at any given time. However, records of acquiring and retiring mobile assets
provide a means of keeping an inventory listing. Manual inspection or bar code readers
provide a means of identifying the locations of the various assets. Figure 3.1 illustrates
a typical mobile asset in the form of a postal truck used for carrying mail and parcels.
Replacement parts for infrastructure such as elevators represent another class of
potentially mobile assets that might be inventoried by an infrastructure manager.

3.2 Manual Inspection and Condition Assessment of Infrastructure
Manual inspection and condition assessment of infrastructure components is a common
practice. These inspections require a knowledgeable individual and can include visual
inspection, hearing (for motor sounds for example) and touch.
Good manual inspections have a defined rubric and a focus on completeness and
consistency of condition assessment. A rubric is a guide for condition assessment
based upon a set of rules or text descriptions. A wide variety of rubrics for
infrastructure components exists. Figure 3.2 summarizes a rubric for pavement
condition assessment as an example. In addition to this pavement condition
assessment, other consideration for conditions might be skid resistance and structural
capacity. Chapter 2, presents the results of a series of roof inspections with indices for
roof components and an overall condition assessment.

Pavement Serviceability Index Guidelines

•

•

•

4.0 – 5.0: Only new (or nearly new) superior pavements are likely to be smooth enough and
distress free (sufficiently free of cracks and patches) to qualify for this category. Most
pavements constructed or resurfaced during the data year would normally be rated in this
category.
3.0 – 4.0: Pavements in this category, although not quite as smooth as those described above,
give a first class ride and exhibit few, if any, visible signs of surface deterioration. Flexible
pavements may be beginning to show evidence of rutting and fine random cracks. Rigid
pavements may be beginning to show evidence of slight surface deterioration, such as minor
cracks and spalling.
2.0 – 3.0: The riding qualities of pavements in this category are noticeably inferior to those of
new pavements, and may be barely tolerable for high-speed traffic. Surface defects of flexible
pavements may include rutting, map cracking, and extensive patching. Rigid pavements in this
group may have a few joint failures, faulting and/or cracking, and some pumping.
1.0 – 2.0: Pavements in this category have deteriorated to such an extent that they affect the
speed of free-flow traffic. Flexible pavement may have large potholes and deep cracks.
Distress includes raveling, cracking, rutting and occurs over 50 percent of the surface. Rigid
pavement distress includes joint spalling, patching, cracking, scaling, and may include pumping
and faulting.
0.1 – 1.0: Pavements in this category are in an extremely deteriorated condition. The facility is
passable only at reduced speeds, and with considerable ride discomfort. Large potholes and
deep cracks exist. Distress occurs over 75 percent or more of the surface.

Manual inspectors usually compare and discuss their results as a means of inculcating
consistency and accuracy in condition assessments. For some types of inspections,
formal classes and certifications may be required, such as the certification required for
roadway bridge inspections.
Numerical indexes for condition assessment are also common, as with the .1 to 5.0
scale shown in Figure 3.2. Integer indexes are the most common for manual
inspections. However, there is no consistency in the range of defined ratings among
different infrastructure systems: inspectors may employ 0 to 3, 1 to 5, 1 to 10 and
others. The best ratings also differ, with some systems having higher numbers for
better conditions (as in Figure 3.2) and some indexes having lower numbers for better
conditions.
Through the application of various manual rating systems condition indices, the
following general guidelines emerge with respect to condition indices: it is difficult to
differentiate between more than 7 condition states; a condition state of zero (0) may

24

cause difficulties in derivative calculations; rating systems that equate a higher value
with a better condition tend to graph more intuitively. Regardless, users of condition
indexes should always check the index definitions to avoid misinterpretation of
conditions!
Numerical condition indexes are often used in deterioration models as discussed in
Chapter 3. They are also useful for developing comparisons and metrics of overall
infrastructure conditions. For example, Figure 3.3 shows a map of pavement conditions
in a region of central Massachusetts.

Management,’ http://www.cmrpc.org/transportation-data-and-maps.

While condition assessments are usually numerical, they may also take the form of a
condition grade, such as the scale A – excellent; B – very good; C – good; D – passable
and F – failing.
Infrastructure ‘grades’ are also regularly prepared, but they generally involve a broader
range of considerations than a simple condition assessment. These grades might
include functional compliance with particular goals, adequacy of capacity relative to
demand, infrastructure resilience and other considerations as well as the infrastructure
condition. As an example, the criteria used in assigning infrastructure grades by the
25

American Society of Civil Engineers (2016) includes condition rating but a variety of
other criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

•

Capacity – Evaluate the infrastructure’s capacity to meet current and future
demands.
Condition – Evaluate the infrastructure’s existing or near future physical
condition.
Funding – Evaluate the current level of funding (from all levels of government) for
the infrastructure category and compare it to the estimated funding need.
Future Need – Evaluate the cost to improve the infrastructure and determine if
future funding prospects will be able to meet the need.
Operation and Maintenance – Evaluate the owners’ ability to operate and
maintain the infrastructure properly and determine that the infrastructure is in
compliance with government regulations.
Public Safety – Evaluate to what extent the public’s safety is jeopardized by the
condition of the infrastructure and what the consequences of failure may be.
Resilience – Evaluate the infrastructure system’s capability to prevent or protect
against significant multihazard threats and incidents and the ability to
expeditiously recover and reconstitute critical services with minimum damage to
public safety and health, the economy, and national security.
Innovation – Evaluate the implementation and strategic use of innovative
techniques and delivery methods.

3.3 Devices to Aid Manual Inspection
The previous section outlined procedures for conducting manual inspections of
infrastructure components. There are a variety of devices that can be used to aid such
manual inspections.
Rulers and gauges are often useful for measuring lengths and depths of components or
cracks. Mobile (battery) powered drills, wrenches and wire brushes also can be useful.
Devices to aid visual inspection in difficult or impossible to reach vantage points can be
particularly useful. Hand held mirrors and lamps are a simple example of such an aid,
but devices that are more elaborate exist. Figure 3.4 shows a video camera that suited
for use in small pipe that can provide pictures of the interiors so that corrosion or root
intrusions may be identified. More elaborate pipeline ‘pigs’ can be stabilized in a
desired location within the pipe and can have self-locomotion.

pipe of interest.

Unmanned flying vehicles (commonly called ‘drones’) provide another means of aiding
manual inspections (Figure 3.5). These devices can simplify inspection of a variety of
infrastructure components such as bridges or power lines. Drones are regulated for
safety reasons and inspectors using such devices must determine the acceptable use of
drones in any particular location. In addition to unmanned flying devices, underwater
aids for visual inspection are also available, but visibility for such devices may be an
issue.

3.4 Sensors for Inspection Condition Assessment
A variety of tests can also be used to assist or to replace manual inspection. For
example, infrared images may be obtained to aid roof inspection, with areas of high
heat flux indicating insulation issues. Water samples can be tested for a variety of trace
elements. These test results can be considered in arriving at a particular condition
assessment rating.
An example of automated, sensor based condition assessment is the widely used
International Roughness Index (IRI) for pavements. This index is based upon the
vertical variation on a pavement surface over a particular length of pavement. More
vertical variation represents rougher and worse condition pavement. The International
Roughness Index is calculated from laser depth measurements and reported in units of
length (of vertical variation) divided by length of measurement, such as millimeters per
meter. Figure 3.6 shows typical International Roughness Index values for different

28

types of pavements and for different pavement distress types. Also shown on Figure
3.6 is a typical use speed for pavements of different conditions.

Figure 3.6 - International Roughness Index

Source: Sayers, 1986. Redrawn and altered by Authors.

For an automated index such as the International Roughness Index, a manager would
like to know how the index might compare to manual inspections and how the index
might correlate to user costs (or in this case, traveler comfort). Fortunately, for the
International Roughness Index there is good correlation with both manual inspections
and reported ride quality as long as roughness measurements are made for the full
width of the pavement surface.
Other automated approaches for pavement condition assessment are also possible. In
particular, video images of pavement surfaces can be analyzed by software for a direct
condition assessment. These methods make use of less expensive sensors in the form
of video cameras and rely on pattern recognition approaches for pavement distress. In
many cases, a combination of different approaches can be employed, with manual
inspection often used for maintenance alternatives assessment.
A variety of other non-destructive sensors can be used for infrastructure component
inspection. Visual inspection is described above, but others can include: Liquid

29

Penetrant, Magnetic, Ultrasonic, Eddy Current and X-ray sensors. Figure 3.7 illustrates
the use of ultrasonic sensors for identifying potential structural flaws hidden within a
component such as a steel building beam or rail.

We will close with a few examples of devices and sensors used for different types of
infrastructure inspections.
•
•

•

•

Power plant equipment and facilities can be visually inspected, but hard to
reach elements and corrosion identification require special sensors. Eddy
current probes, crawling robots and flying drones may all help inspectors.
Periodic wire rope inspection for aerial lifts and transmission lines is always
recommended (and often required by regulation). While visual inspection is
the traditional method of inspection, drones, measuring devices and sensors
for internal flaws can all be used.
Storage tank inspection is routinely performed. Above ground tanks can be
observed manually, with crawlers or with drones. Below ground tanks can be
inspected from the inside (as with pipes), but exterior inspection below ground
is difficult.
Rail inspection can be performed manually, but specialized sensors are
usually employed to assess geometry or hidden defects. Dedicated vehicles

30

•

are commonly used, but there is already equipment available that can monitor
rail condition from regularly running trains.
Natural gas leaks have specialized sensors that may be handheld or
designed for vehicles. Since natural gas (or methanol) is a potent
greenhouse gas, new emphasis on inspection for leak identification and repair
is becoming more prevalent and important.

Rutting and Depressions

A rut is a depression in the wheel paths.
Rutting stems from a permanent
deformation in any of the pavement
layers or sub grade, usually caused by
consolidated or lateral movement of the
materials due to traffic loads.

4.1 Introduction
As soon as infrastructure is newly built or rehabilitated, it begins to deteriorate. The
decline in overall infrastructure condition may be slow, but it is inevitable. The decline
may be mitigated by preventive maintenance or even reversed by major rehabilitation
actions such as repaving, but deterioration will again proceed without continuing
interventions that are likely to be expensive.
The common ‘Deterioration Hypothesis’ posits that infrastructure will deteriorate over
time due to use and other factors. The strict form of the ‘Deterioration Hypothesis’
assumes that conditions cannot improve over time unless there is an intervention by
infrastructure managers and workers. Typical factors causing deterioration are
weathering, corrosion, use-related stress, and general wear-and-tear. Figure 4.1
illustrates the deterioration hypothesis with slow condition degradation for a period of
time, then a more rapid deterioration as the infrastructure ages and its condition
degrades. As shown in the figure, interventions for asset preservation can improve the
asset condition rating, but the deterioration then resumes.

36

http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/statewide/practices/asset_sustainability_index/page
01.cfm. A decline in condition over time without preservation efforts.

While the deterioration hypothesis is used for infrastructure components, it is also
relevant and used for a variety of other devices. For example, paper may deteriorate
due to insects, mold, fire, water damage, chemical reactions caused by light, wear-andtear in use and other factors. Mechanical equipment is similar expected to deteriorate
over time. For example, Figure 4.2 shows a worn car. In many cases, worn equipment
must be replaced by regulatory requirements or owner decisions.

The choice of materials and quality of construction can slow the process of
infrastructure deterioration. Similarly, favorable weather conditions can make even
inevitable deterioration quite slow. For example, water penetration with freeze-thaw
cycles in colder climates can result in more rapid occurrence of pavement cracking.
Figure 4.3 shows the probability of acceptable quality (shown as ‘survival probability’)
for bridge decks without rehabilitation work with different material, traffic and
environmental conditions. As can be seen, the spread of survival probabilities over the
different conditions is quite large.

38

of materials, traffic and weather.

As the condition of infrastructure declines, infrastructure managers must consider what
steps (if any) should be taken to reverse the deterioration. Some decisions are
relatively simple, such as intervening on structures in danger of collapse. More
commonly, infrastructure managers make such decisions as part of the asset
management process described earlier.
An important input into such decision making is the expectation of deterioration in the
future if nothing is done to reverse the existing damage. Deterioration modeling is a
process of taking condition assessment information (as described in Chapter 3) and
forecasting expected future conditions.
Numerous approaches to deterioration modelling exist. In this chapter, we will briefly
discuss the following approaches:
1. No deterioration modeling. Use existing condition for decision making.
2. Extrapolation/Moving Average of conditions over time.
3. Regression Models based on statistical analysis.

39

4. Markov Models of probabilistic deterioration.
5. Semi-Markov Models of probabilistic deterioration
6. Neural Networks using an artificial intelligence approach based on a learning set
of deterioration examples.
7. Failure Distributions and Fault Tree Analysis to assess probability of failure.
In this discussion, our intent is to provide sufficient background for infrastructure
managers to understand the different approaches, including their advantages and
disadvantages. Where appropriate, references are provided for those wishing to delve
more completely or deeper into particular approaches.
Finally, all of the deterioration modelling approaches noted above depend upon
empirical data on component deterioration. Keeping such records is a critical asset
management task!

4.2 Simple Decision Making and Forecasting from Condition Assessment
In many cases, asset management decisions are made without complicated
deterioration models at all. The simplest approaches simply use the existing
component condition, a linear projection of the component condition over time, or a
projection based upon the past history of similar components (using a graph such as
those illustrated in Figure 4.3). These approaches are discussed in this section.
Using the existing condition can be augmented with simple decision rules. For
example, ‘if condition is x or lower, then rehabilitation is desirable.’ Components with
only two condition states defined are particularly amenable to this approach. For
example, an incandescent light either works or is burnt out. The maintenance rule
might be to only replace lights when they burn out.
A subset of this simplified method incudes a “run to failure” approach. Unfortunately,
this “fix it when it breaks approach” is a widely applied and expensive approach to
infrastructure management. There are scenarios, like window air conditioners, when it
simply doesn’t make sense to replace before failure. As we will explore, it is nearly
always more cost effective to replace before failure when considering major
infrastructure systems.
Using existing conditions has the advantage of eliminating any costs associated with
deterioration modelling. However, the amount of effort may fluctuate considerably as
many components cross over the trigger condition for action and this may not be
compatible with budget constraints. Also, if deterioration has significant costs, waiting
until deterioration occurs may not be the best approach.
Simple linear extrapolation is another approach that is inexpensive to employ for
deterioration models. In this approach, c where ct is the condition at time t, and Δt is
40

some desired time period in the future.

𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡+∆𝑡𝑡 = 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 + (𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 − 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡−1 ) ∗ ∆𝑡𝑡

Eq. 4.1

As an example, suppose the component condition is now 3, last year the condition was
4, then the forecast for next year is 3 + (3-4)*1 = 3 – 1 = 2 and the forecast for the
following year (two years from now) would be 3 + (3-4)*2 = 1. More complicated forms
of extrapolation could also be used, but linear extrapolation is the most common for
infrastructure deterioration.
A single year may be two short a period to effectively capture deterioration, so a moving
average of multiple years might be used instead. In this case, ct would be the average
condition for the current period of years (which might be the past three years). This
approach would be useful for very slowly deteriorating infrastructure components.
Moving averages of this type are common for smoothing fluctuating time series histories
such as stock prices.
Finally, forecasts of component deterioration might be based upon simple historical
records. For example, Figure 4.3 shows the average deterioration trajectory of different
bridge decks under specific conditions. An infrastructure manager might assume that a
particular bridge deck with a particular condition would simply follow this trajectory in the
future. Even without a formal database, infrastructure managers might have their
mental model of expected deterioration and make subjective forecasts based upon their
experience.

4.3 Regression Models
A more complicated approach to deterioration modelling than those in the previous
section employs statistical approaches, most commonly regression analysis. These
models are based upon observations of past history and conditions. The models can
indicate the correlation between conditions and explanatory factors such as time and
usage.
Statistical modelling is a topic of considerable interest and for which a large body of
knowledge exists. In this section, we provide only the basic information that is useful for
an infrastructure manager, not a researcher or expert modeler. Other works can be
consulted, such as the variety of books recommended by the University of California,
Berkeley, Statistics Department:
http://sgsa.berkeley.edu/current-students/recommended-books
There are also a variety of software programs that can be used for statistical modelling,
including add-ins to spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, general modelling
environments such as MATLAB, or programs focused on statistical modelling such as
R, S, Minitab or Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Any of these
41

software programs can be used for infrastructure deterioration modelling since the data
usually available for deterioration modelling are well within the capabilities of any of
these software programs. Also, these programs typically provide help files and tutorials
that can be consulted.
For deterioration models, the dependent variable is typically condition expressed as a
numerical index. Explanatory variables may be time (such as age in years since last
rehabilitation), usage, weather zone and others. Different deterioration models may be
estimated for different component designs, such as pavement characteristics, or these
characteristics may be added. For example, a simple linear condition model might be:

𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∗ (𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 ) + 𝜖𝜖

Eq. 4.2

where c is a condition index (such as a scale of 1 to 10), α and β are coefficients to be
estimated and ε is a model error term. A series of observations of c and age would be
assembled as input data for estimation. Then, a software routine could be employed to
estimate appropriate values of the coefficients α and β for the estimated model. In
these routines, the coefficients α and β are calculated to minimize the sum of squared
deviations between condition and the model forecast (represented by the ε values).
Equation 4.2 shows a linear deterioration model, meaning that the explanatory variable
age is linearly related to the dependent variable condition index. Additional explanatory
variables could be added to the model, each with a coefficient to be estimated. Also,
non-linear model forms can be used, such as a quadratic model where age enters as
both a linear and a squared explanatory variable:

𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 ∗ (𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 ) + 𝛽𝛽2 ∗ (𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 )2 + 𝜖𝜖

Eq. 4.3

𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 ∗ (𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 )𝛽𝛽

Eq. 4.4

ln(𝑐𝑐 ) = 𝛼𝛼 ′ + 𝛽𝛽 ∗ (𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 ) + 𝜖𝜖

Eq. 4.5

Another common model form is an exponential model form:

This exponential model is often linearized for estimation purposes by taking the
logarithm of both sides of the equation to form a linear model with respect to the
coefficients to be estimated:

Where α’ is the logarithm (ln function) of α in Equation 4.3. In this linear form, the input
data for estimation would be ln(c) and age.
Which model form should be chosen for use in any particular case? Generally
speaking, simply forms are preferable to more complicated forms. Also, model forms
that correspond to reasonable deterioration causes are preferable. For example,

42

desirable pavement deterioration model forms would include both deterioration over
time and for different levels of vehicle usage.
As an example, Morous (2011) estimated a polynomial model of bridge deck
deterioration in Nebraska based simply on bridge deck age. The estimated model was:

𝑦𝑦 = 10 − 0.25 ∗ 𝑥𝑥 + 0.0093 ∗ 𝑥𝑥 2 − 0.0001 ∗ 𝑥𝑥 3

Eq. 4.6

where y is condition rating (c in Eq. 4.1-4.4) and x is age (or age in Eq. 4.1-4.4). As can
be seen in Fig. 4.4, the polynomial model is close to the historical data on bridge
deterioration. Morous (2011) also reports the R2 value of the estimated regression
equation (equal to .99 in Figure 4.4) which is a measure of ‘goodness of fit’ of the model
to the data. In this case, 99% of the variation in the dependent variable is captured by
the regression model.

Figure 4.4 - Deterioration History and Model of Original Bridge Decks in Nebraska

Source: Morous, 2011, UNL Digital Commons. http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/. In the model, y is
condition-rating index and x is age in years.

The usefulness of regression deterioration models really derives from situations in
which multiple explanatory factors are of interest, such as age, pavement type and
vehicle usage (generally measured in equivalent standard axle loads) for roadway
pavements or bridge decks. For the model shown in Fig. 4.4, the use of historical data
or the regression model has the same forecasting ability. But with more factors
43

considered, two dimensional graphical representations such as Fig. 4.4 cannot be used
directly.
Regression approaches typically make fairly heroic assumptions about the available
data and appropriate model forms. In particular, the values of the error term ε in
Equations 4.1 - 4.3 are generally assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero,
independent of each other and with a constant variance. It is unlikely that any
deterioration models fulfill these formal assumptions exactly. If nothing else, condition
ratings typically are constrained to be positive, so highly negative values of ε are not
allowed. Moreover, historical observations of components are unlikely to be completely
independent. Fortunately, regression deterioration models are usually fairly robust, so
deviation from the formal assumptions is not a practical problem to obtain reasonable
coefficient estimates. However, factors such as correlated error terms make the use of
formal statistical testing approaches problematic.
Regression models indicate correlations rather than causation. For example,
deterioration with age (as in Figures 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4) may not be ‘caused’ by age itself,
but by weather related effects. Weathering would be highly correlated with age for most
pavement sections. However, a pavement or bridge deck section kept inside a building
would likely not deteriorate over time in a manner that sections exposed to weather
would deteriorate. Managers should always be cautious to ascribe causation in the
case of correlations.
Forecasts from regression models are uncertain, as is the case for all deterioration
models. Based on past histories and distribution assumptions, it is possible to estimate
confidence intervals for forecast values. Figure 4.5 provides an example, with
confidence intervals for Australian tax receipts shown, where a 90% confidence interval
suggests that the forecast receipts will fall within the interval 90% of the time. The 90%
confidence interval in this case for the following year is from 18 to 22.5 as a percent of
Australian Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Developing formal confidence intervals
would be unusual for infrastructure management, but the managers themselves should
always be aware that the actual outcomes will likely differ from forecasts.

4.4 Markov Deterioration Models
Markov deterioration models are used in numerous asset management software
programs. Markov models can readily accommodate use of condition indexes with
integer values and deterioration estimation for discrete time periods such as a year or a
decade. As a result, Markov models can be combined with typical condition
assessment techniques and budgeting processes.
Markov models are stochastic processes with forecast probabilities of transitions among
different states (x, where x is a vector of multiple potential states) at particular times (t)
or x(t). Markov models of this type are often called ‘Markov chains’ to emphasize the
transitions among states. For infrastructure component models, the states are usually
assumed to be different condition indexes. If a component is in some particular
condition state (xi) then it might stay in that condition or deteriorate in the next year.
Figure 4.6 illustrates a process with just three defined condition states (1 – good, 2 –
intermediate, 3 – bad condition). If the condition at the beginning of the year is state 2
(intermediate), then the Markov process shows a 0.8 probability or 80% chance of
remaining in the same condition and a 0.2 probability or 20% chance of deteriorating to
state 3. If the component begins in state 3 (bad or poor condition), then there is no
chance of improvement (or a 100% chance of remaining in the same state). State 3 is
an ‘absorbing state’ since there is no chance of a transition out of state 3.

45

Figure 4.6 - Illustration of a Markov Process - 3 Condition States & No Intervention

Source: Authors. In each period, the condition may remain the same or deteriorate with the
probabilities shown on the arrows.

The Markov process in Figure 4.6 illustrates the pure deterioration hypothesis, in that
the component cannot improve condition over time. Beginning in state 1, the
component could deteriorate to state 3 within two years and then remain permanently in
state 3. More likely, the component would stay in state 1 or state 2 for a number of
years, and the deterioration to state 3 would take multiple years. Note that the transition
probabilities do not change over time, so the Markov model assumes that the time spent
in any state does not increase the probability of deterioration (this is often called the
‘memory-less property’ of Markov models).
A Markov process may be shown in graphic form as in Figure 4.8 or as a table or matrix
of transition probabilities. Formally, the state vector is x = (1, 2, 3) and the transition
matrix P has three rows and three columns corresponding to the last three columns and
bottom three rows in Table 4.1 (as shown in Figure 4.9). Note that the rows of the
transition matrix must sum to 1.0 to properly represent probabilities.

What happens if the infrastructure manager adopts the policy that components in state
3 will always be rehabilitated to state 1? In this case of intervention, there would be a
transition from state 3 to state 1 with a 1.0 probability. The Forecasting conditions (or
more precisely, forecasting the probability of particular states) with a Markov model
involves application of linear matrix algebra. In particular, a one period forecast takes
the existing state probabilities in period n, 𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛 , and multiplies the transition probability
matrix:

𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛+1 = 𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛 ∗ 𝑃𝑃

Eq. 4.7

𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛+𝑚𝑚 = 𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚−𝑛𝑛

Eq. 4.8

The forecast calculation may be continued for as many periods as you like. A forecast
from period n to period m would be:

Using Eq. 4.2, a forecast two periods from now would multiply 𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛 by P*P. Figure 4.7
illustrates the calculations for a two period forecast using the transition probabilities in
Table 4.1 and assuming the initial condition is state 1 (good). While it is possible to
transition from good condition to bad condition in two periods, the probability of
deteriorating this quickly is only 0.04 or 4%. Most likely, the component would remain in
good condition for two periods, with probability 0.64 or 64%. As a check on the
calculations, note that the forecast probabilities sum to one: 0.64 + 0.32 + 0.04 = 1.0.

The procedure shown in Figure 4.7 can be extended to find the median time until
component failure. By continuing to forecast further into the future (by multiplying 𝜋𝜋 by
P repeatedly), the probability of entering the absorbing state 3 will increase. The
median time until entering this state is identified when the probability reaches 0.5 or
50%. It is also possible to calculate the expected or mean time before component
failure analytically. However, the median time is likely of more use in planning

47

maintenance and rehabilitation activities for a large number of infrastructure
components.
Numerous software programs can be used to perform the matrix algebra calculations
illustrated in Figure 4.7. Two popular programs that have matrix algebra functions
provided are the spreadsheet program EXCEL and the numerical analysis program
MATLAB.
Where would an infrastructure manager obtain transition probability estimates such as
those in Table 4.1? The most common approach is to create a historical record of
conditions and year to year deterioration as described in Chapter 3: Condition
Assessment or illustrated in Figure 4.3. Historical records could give the frequency of
deterioration for a particular type of component and for a particular situation. Expert,
subjective judgments might also be used, but these expert judgments are informed by
analysis or observation of such deteriorations over time.
Finally, we have presented in this section the simplest form of Markov process
modelling. We have done so because this simple form seems to be useful for
infrastructure management, with many Markov process applications for components
such as roadways or bridges. A variety of extensions or variations are possible:
•

•

Rather than discrete annual steps being modelling, a Markov model may use
continuous time. In this case, the transition probabilities are modelled as a
negative exponential probability distribution.
If the ‘memory less’ property of the simple Markov model seems unacceptable,
you can adopt a semi-Markov assumption or even augment the state space to
include both conditions and age in condition states. Unfortunately, the resulting
models become more complicated and require more data for accurate
estimation.

Readers wishing a broader and more mathematically rigorous presentation of Markov
processes should consult a book such as Grimstead and Snell (2012) which is available
for free download on the internet.

4.5 Artificial Neural Network Deterioration Models
Artificial Neural networks can serve as an alternative to regression or Markov
deterioration models. They are based upon an analogy to how simple biological brains
behave in transmitting signals among individual neural cells. They originated in work on
artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Figure 4.8 illustrates a neural network. Inputs might be condition index values, age or
weather effects. Outputs might be probabilities of transitioning to particular conditions
over the course of a year. Figure 4.8 illustrates the signal processing that would be

48

occurring within each of the artificial neurons (represented as circles in Figure 4.8). The
input signals are weighted, combined and transformed into an output activation.

49

Artificial neural networks are typically ‘trained’ with a learning set. For a deterioration
model, inputs might consist of conditions (and other relevant factors) in the base year
and the training outputs would be the observed conditions in the following year.
Training consists of altering parameters (such as the weights in Figure 4.9) to best
reproduce the results observed in the training set.
Artificial neural networks are not frequently used for component deterioration modelling.
One drawback to their use is the ‘black box’ nature of the results where the various
weights and activation functions are difficult to interpret (or even obtain). Also, artificial
neural networks typically have many more parameters than other types of models,
requiring more data to be robust.
Infrastructure managers are more likely to encounter artificial neural networks in
conjunction with sensor interpretation. For example, artificial neural networks can be
used to identify vehicles or pavement distress from video inputs. Figure 4.10 illustrates
a video based system for vehicle identification. A frame from the camera is divided into
a two dimensional set of tiles within a pre-defined detection zone and the color and
brightness of the pixels within each tile are input to an artificial neural network vehicle
detector model. A training set of images with and without vehicles is used to adjust
parameters in the detector model. In turn, traffic identification of this type can be used
in a deterioration model for pavement condition.

the vehicle moves through the detection zone, counting output is activated for each part
of the zone.

4.6 Failure Rates and Survival Probabilities
In addition to deterioration models linked to component condition indexes, deterioration
models may also be expressed as probabilities of failure (or survival as the inverse of
failure) at different points of time. Of course, a difficulty in using this approach for
infrastructure components is to define what constitutes ‘failure.’ For a mechanical
device such as an elevator, failure might be simply regarded as ceasing to work. For a
roadway pavement, the pavement might be considered to have failed when a desired
level of service is not provided, even though the roadway may still be passable at low
speed.
Failure rates are defined as the likelihood of failure in the next time interval assuming
that the component has not failed up until the present time. The failure rate typically is
larger than the failure density function since the component has survived for one or
more periods. Since infrastructure managers are concerned with forecasting possibility
of failure in the next period or two for decision making, the failure rate is generally of
more interest rather than the direct probability of failure of a component at any given
time in the future. We will use a numerical example to illustrate failure rates, survival
probability and failure probabilities using the data shown in Table 4.2.

Table 4.2 illustrates a component that is in good condition at the present but is expected
to certainly fail after ten years of use. The probability of failure f(t) (Column 2)
represents an estimate of failure in each period, with a 10% of failure immediately
(during a break in period), a period of low probability of failure in years 2-6 (regular use)

52

and then an increasing probability of failure in years 8 to 10 (wearing out). The
cumulative probability of failure F(t) is the sum of failure probabilities for period t and
previous periods. It begins at zero and increases steadily to 1.0 (certain failure) by year
10. Cumulative probability of survival R(t) is the inverse of the cumulative probability of
failure, 1 – F(t). The failure rate λ(t) can be calculated as:
𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡)

𝜆𝜆(𝑡𝑡 ) = 𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡 ) −

𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡−1)
𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡)

Eq. 4.11

It has a value of 0.1 in period 1, reflecting the possibility of failure during the break in
period. After this, the failure rate is relative low but increasing slowly. During the final
wear our period, the failure rate increases substantially. Note that the sum of the failure
rates during all periods is in excess of 1, so the failure rate is not a probability.
However, for decision making, an infrastructure manager would find it helpful to know in
year 5 that the risk of failure in the next period is small (0.024). However, in year 8,
while the component still may be working, the risk of failure in the next period is
substantial (0.400). The pattern of the failure probabilities and rates in Table 4.1 is
common for infrastructure components and often called a ‘bathtub shape’ as illustrated
in Figure 4.12 below.

Initial break in use of a component often reveals design or fabrication flaws that may
cause failure. After this break in period, a (hopefully lengthy) period of regular use and
low failure risk occurs. As the component wears out, the risk of failure increases.
Figures 4.13 and 4.14 further illustrate these periods graphically for failure probability
and cumulative probabilities.

The numerical example presented above did not assume any particular distributional
form for the failure probabilities. However, many applications of failure models assume
some particular distribution and use historical data to estimate the parameters of the

54

distribution. We will discuss two distributions used in this fashion: the exponential and
Weibull distributions.
The form of the exponential failure model for cumulative probability of failure is:
𝑡𝑡

𝐹𝐹 (𝑡𝑡 ) = ∫0 𝛼𝛼 ∗ 𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 1 − 𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼

Eq. 4.11

Which is the integral from 0 to time t of the parameter α times exponential of −𝛼𝛼 ∗ 𝑡𝑡 or,
more simply, one minus the exponential of −𝛼𝛼 ∗ 𝑡𝑡. The probability density function of

failure for the exponential distributions is 𝛼𝛼 ∗ 𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 . The exponential function has only
one parameter (α in this notation) and the average time to failure is the reciprocal of this
1
𝛼𝛼

parameter ( ). The failure rate is constant over time with a value of the parameter α
(calculated from Eq. 4.11 as ∗

𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼
𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼

= 𝛼𝛼 ). With the negative sign in the cumulative and

density failure distributions, the exponential function is often referred to as a ‘negative
exponential distribution.’

Figures 4.15 and 4.16 illustrate the form of the exponential function for different
parameter values. The cumulative failure probability increases relatively rapidly initially
(except for low values of the parameter α) and continues to slowly increase for a long
period of time.

graphic uses λ for the distribution parameter rather than α, x for the time period rather than t and
P(x) for f(t).

Estimation of the parameter α is relatively simple in practice. Given a set of component
failure observations, the parameter α is the inverse of the average time until failure
observed in the sample.
A second distribution often assumed for failure models is the Weibull or ‘extreme
events’ distribution. The term ‘extreme events’ reflects the use of the Weibull
distribution for modelling events such as the probability of earthquakes or hurricane
wind speeds. It also reflects the notion that the distribution returns the probability of
most extreme value obtained from a series of random variable results. For
infrastructure components involving a large number of pieces that might fail, this
analogy is appropriate. The distribution is named for Wallodi Weibull, a Swedish
engineer and mathematician who lived in the twentieth century.
The general form of the Weibull distribution includes three parameters. Using the
notation of NIST (2016), the parameters are μ (called the location parameter), γ (called
the shape parameter) and α (called the scale parameter). The failure probability density
function is shown below, with x representing time:
𝜆𝜆

𝜆𝜆 𝑥𝑥−𝜇𝜇 (𝜆𝜆−1) (−�𝑥𝑥−𝜇𝜇� )
𝛼𝛼
�
𝑒𝑒
𝛼𝛼

𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥 ) = 𝛼𝛼 �

where 𝑥𝑥 ≥ 𝜇𝜇; 𝜆𝜆, 𝛼𝛼 > 0

56

Eq. 4.11

Simpler forms of the Weibull distribution function may be obtained by assuming values
of the location parameter (such as μ = 0) and the scale parameter (such as α = 1).
Thus, one, two or three parameter forms can be obtained.
With different values of the three parameters, a wide variety of distributional forms may
be obtained. Figure 4.17 illustrates the effects of different values of just the shape
parameter.

4.7 Fault Tree Analysis
The previous section described various models of component failure forecasting. Fault
trees are used to forecast the failure probability of a system of components based upon
the likelihood of component failures. Fault trees provide a means of identifying
weaknesses in systems and allowing managers to make changes to reduce the risk of
failure.

57

Fault trees begin with a top node representing the condition of the entire system.
Causes for system failure are then developed as a series of events and subcomponents
that may cause failures. Multiple layers of subcomponents may be included. Figure
4.18 illustrates a simple fault tree with three layers and eight different elements.

As an example, suppose an infrastructure manager is tasked with ensuring electricity is
available in a building at all times. The manager invests in a back-up generator in case
the grid electricity fails. In this case, the building might not have electricity if the grid
fails and the back-up generator fails to start. In any given day, if there is a 1% chance
(0.01 probability) that the power grid may fail and a 5% chance (0.05 probability) that
the back-up generators fails, then there is a 0.0005 or 0.05% chance that electricity will
fail. This is an example in which the redundancy of power sources reduces the chances
of not having power for the building. A further step of analysis might be to examine
reasons for failure of the back-up generator such as lack of fuel or damage to wiring.
Also, a manager might set up a regular inspection regime for the back-up generator to
attempt to reduce its 5% chance of failure.

58

This electric power provision is an example of redundancy with an ‘and’ node: both the
power grid and the backup generator must fail for the system to fail. Unfortunately,
system failures might also occur if any one of a number of events occurs. This is would
be an ‘or’ node. For example, a ladder would fail if either of the two vertical supports
failed. If the probability that a vertical support fails is 1% (0.01 probability) in normal
use, then the probability of success is 0.99. There are four cases that might arise from
use:
1. Both vertical supports work with probability 0.99*0.99 = 0.9801
2. Left support breaks and right support does not fail, but ladder as a system fails
with probability 0.01*0.99 = 0.0099
3. Right support breaks and left support does not fail, but ladder as a system fails
with probability 0.01*0.99 = 0.0099
4. Both vertical supports fail and the ladder system fails with probability 0.01*0.01 =
0.0001
With a ‘or’ node relationships (multiple potential causes of failure), the probability of
failure can be calculated as:

Pr{𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 } = ∑𝑖𝑖 {1 − Pr(𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 )}

Eq. 4.12

Where the summation ∑ is taken over all the subcomponents included in the ‘or’ node
level.
A common convention in drawing fault tree networks is to represent ‘or’ gate
relationships with a curve at the bottom (as in the top gate in figure 4.17) and an ‘and’
gate relationship with a straight bottom (as in the bottom gate for events 7 and 8 in
Figure 4.17). The failure probability of the system in Figure 4.17 would then be traced
through the three ‘or’ gates and the two ‘and’ gates:
Pr{System Fig. 4.x failure} = [1 - (1-Pr{event 1 failure})*(1-Pr{event 2 failure}] +
Pr{event 3 failure}*Pr{event 4 failure}*Pr{event 5 failure} +
[1 – (1 - Pr{event 6 failure}*(1-Pr{event 7 failure}*Pr{event 8 failure}] Eq.
Eq. 4.13
More complicated relationship gates can be defined (such as exclusive ‘or’ gates), but
they are not widely used for any infrastructure failure models. These more complicated
relationships can find use in fault tree analysis of circuits or computer operating
systems.
A complication in the calculation of failure probabilities shown above will occur when
failures are correlated in some fashion. For example, flooding might cause both the

59

power grid and the backup generator to fail in the electric power example above. In this
case, the straightforward probability of the backup generator failing, Pr{failure backup
generator} would be replaced with the probability of failure of the backup generator
conditional on the power grid failure: Pr{failure backup generator │ failure power grid}.
Of course, a prudent infrastructure manager might insure that the backup generator is
protected from floods, so this chance of system failure due to flooding would disappear.
Another difficulty for fault tree analysis for infrastructure is that some systems may not
fail completely but may degrade in performance. For example, a roof may start to leak
rather than fail completely. For such cases, separate degradation states can be defined
and fault trees developed for each level of degradation.
Fault tree analysis is fairly labor intensive and it is difficult to be comprehensive about
potential failure modes. However, the conceptual process of identifying failure causes
and events can be helpful in managing the reliability of infrastructure systems.

5.1 Introduction
Infrastructure managers must make decisions on a regular basis. They must make
decisions about allocating time and other organizational resources. For infrastructure
components, managers must make decisions about maintenance and rehabilitation in
each planning period. In many cases, the decision about procedures to apply to a
particular infrastructure component may be to ‘do-nothing,’ but it is prudent for a
manager to make such a decision consciously rather than simply from lack of oversight.
With continuing deterioration, some maintenance or rehabilitation will be needed to
prevent failure of the component.
This chapter discusses the use of optimization approaches to aid infrastructure
management decision making. No previous experience with formal optimization
approaches is assumed. Our intent is not to cover all the different approaches to
optimization, but to illustrate how optimization might be used for infrastructure
management. We don’t expect readers to become experts in optimization from reading
this chapter. However, a manager may not ever develop their own optimization problem
formulations. However, many asset management software programs include
optimization sub-routines, and a manager using such programs should understand their
approach. Also, optimization provides a useful conceptual approach to aid structuring
decision making, even if formal optimization procedures are not used.
Optimization has been used in numerous applications that are not discussed in this
chapter. In particular, optimization is used to aid production planning, vehicle routing,
inventory controls, and engineering design. Optimization is also used for estimation of
parameter values. Regression models, as discussed in Chapter 4 on Deterioration
Models, is a form of optimization. Just as one example, the package delivery company
UPS uses optimization to suggest vehicle routes for their deliveries. The route planning
minimizes driving cost in terms of time and fuel use. With route planning technology
introduced in 2004, UPS has saved a million gallons of fuel each year (UPS 2016).
All optimization problems have some common features. The user is interested in
searching for maximum (or minimum) values for an objective function. For
infrastructure management, the objective might be to maximize the average condition of
66

components or to minimize money spent on maintenance and rehabilitation. There are
a set of decision variables obtained in finding an optimization solution. For
infrastructure management, the most common decision variables are actions performed
on particular components, such as rehabilitation options for different roadway sections.
There are a set of constraints imposed on the decision variables. For example, there
may be an available budget for infrastructure management, a minimum allowable
component condition, or a requirement that one and only one rehabilitation option is
chosen for each component in a single year. Finally, there is some solution process
(usually called a solution algorithm) to obtain optimal values of the decision variables.
In practice, management problems are sufficiently large that software packages are
used to obtain such solutions.
Engineers and scientists first encounter optimization as part of the study of calculus. In
particular, maximum values of a function with a single variable can be obtained by
setting the first derivative to zero and insuring that the second derivative of the function
is positive:
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑥𝑥)
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

= 0,

𝑑𝑑 2𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥)
𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥 2

>0

Eq. 5.1

There may be a single value of x that maximizes the equation, or there may be multiple
values.

5.2 Linear Optimization for Infrastructure Management
Problems with continuous decision variables and linear constraints and objective
functions are very common and have attracted considerable research attention. These
problems are solved with linear programming algorithms such as the Simplex method.
Typical software can accommodate thousands of decision variables and constraints.
Formally, a linear program is represented as:
Maximize 𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑥𝑥 subject to Ax = y and x ≥ 0

Eq. 5.2

Where c is a vector of parameters, x is a vector of continuous decision variables, A is a
matrix of parameters and y is a vector of constraint parameters. This formulation can
accommodate inequality constraints with the addition of decision variables representing
slack in the constraints. For example, the constraint x1 + x2 ≤ 5 (shown in Figure 5.1)
would be re-written as x1 + x2 + x3 = 5 and a positive value of x3 in the optimal solution
would indicate that the constraint is not binding. Similarly, decision variables can take
on any value (both negative and positive) with the addition of decision variables. In
practice, linear programming software can take as input inequalities and unconstrained
decision variables and convert the problem into the standard form of Eq. 5.2

67

A linear program has three types of solution possibilities:
•

No solution possible. An example would be: Maximize decision variable x
subject to the constraints x < 1 and x > 5. No value of x will satisfy both
constraints. For infrastructure management, an example would be if a budget is
inadequate to achieve required functional conditions.
A single optimal solution exists. For example, a roadway management problem
might be to maximize average condition of roadway segments subject to a
budget constraint. Typically, a set of maintenance actions (such as repaving or
patching) for a subset of roadway segments will be identified that completely
uses the budget. A more extensive example of this problem appears below.

•

Multiple optimal solutions exist. In Figure 5.1, the line segment between A and B
includes an infinite number of optimal solutions which are combinations of the two
decision variables x1 and x2 for the linear program Maximize 2 ∗ 𝑥𝑥1 +

Linear programs possess the useful property that the set of feasible solutions form a
convex region. ‘Feasible’ in this context means a combination of decision variables that
satisfy the problem constraints. The shaded area in Figure 5.1 is the feasible region for
x1 and x2. The shaded area is convex because the line segment between any two
feasible combinations of x1 and x2 would still be in the feasible region. This convexity
has two useful implications. First, any optimal solution will not be a local optimum but
would be a global optimum. That is, if you find a combination of x1 and x2 for which no
improvement is possible from small changes, then no other combination of x1 and x2
with be better. Second, optimum values of the decision variables for a linear program
problem will lie on the boundary of the feasible region, such as the line segment in
Figure 5.1. This property is used by the Simplex solution algorithm for linear programs.
The Simplex method is a common solution method for linear programming problems. It
begins with a ‘basic feasible solution.’ With m constraints and n decision variables, a
basic feasible solutions consists of n-m decision variables set to zero and the remaining
m decision variables the solution to the m linear constraint equations. The simplex
method checks to see if improvement is possible by exchanging one of the n-m decision
variables set to zero with a decision variable in the basic feasible solution. If
improvement is possible, the algorithm makes this switch, which is equivalent to
‘pivoting’ from one extreme point on the convex feasible region to another. Pivots
continue until no such improvement is possible. An initial basic feasible solution can be
obtained simply by adding ‘artificial decision variables’ equal to the value of constraint
parameters and then pivoting away from these artificial variables.
Roadway maintenance and rehabilitation is a good example of linear programming
applied to infrastructure management. In this application, a roadway network is divided
into numerous short sections which might vary from a few kilometers down to individual
blocks in an urban network (with index I ranging from 1 to n segments). Possible
maintenance actions are defined for the roadway sections, such as filling potholes (j =
1), repaving (j = 2) or do-nothing (j = 3). Costs of each action for each pavement
section are then estimated, usually based upon the area of the pavement section (pij).
The condition of each pavement section is forecast assuming that one action is
performed (filling potholes, repaving or doing nothing in this example) (cij where lower
values of cij are more desirable). Then a budget constraint for actions and an objective
function (such as maximizing average system condition) is defined. The result is a
linear programming problem:

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

Equation 5.5

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≤ 0 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗

Equation 5.6

Where xij is action j on section I, cij is forecast condition with action j on section I, n is the
number of roadway segments, pij is the cost of action j on segment I and B is the overall
budget constraint.
In theory, the xij might take on non-integer values between 0 and 1 in this formulation,
but in practice nearly all the optimal xij would be zero or one.
A variety of modifications could be made to the basic formulation of Eq. 5.3 to 5.6. For
the objective function (Eq. 5.3), the condition of each segment might be weighted by
amount of traffic and the segment area. These weights would lead the optimal solution
to favor work on heavily traveled roadways and to minimize average roadway area
condition rather than average segment condition as in Eq. 5.3. Additional roadway
maintenance actions could be defined to extend the constraint Eq. 5.4. The problem
could be altered by defining maximum allowable conditions as a constraint on each
section and then minimizing the cost of achieving this constraint. Even without
changing the objective function in this fashion, maximum allowable condition constraints
can be added if desired.
This strategy of defining actions on infrastructure components is not restricted to
roadway segments. For a manager of a military base or a campus, the problem
formulation in Equations 5.3 - 5.6 might be used for roofs (with replacement or
maintenance as actions), storm water components, building components or a range of
other infrastructure systems.
In formulating linear programming problems, it is useful to address a series of
questions:
•
•
•

What are my possible decisions? How can they be represented as decision
variables?
What is my objective? Can it be represented as a linear function of my decision
variables?
What are the constraints on chosen values of my decision variables? Can they
be represented as linear functions of the decision variables?

Problem formulation is challenging but is an essential step in any optimization. Indeed,
formulation is more challenging than solution since there are many good software
programs available for solution.
The following example illustrates the use of the formulation questions.

70

Problem: Suppose you wish to minimize the cost of delivering ethanol from a set of
production facilities with a maximum production supply Si where i goes from 1 to n, to a
set of metropolitan petroleum mixing facilities (as ethanol is mixed with gasoline) with
required amounts Pj where j goes from 1 to m. Assume the cost of transportation from a
production facility to a mixing facility is Cij. Formulate a linear program problem to serve
the required demand with least cost.
•

What are my possible decisions? How can they be represented as decision
variables? Amount of ethanol shipped from each supply facility to each
metropolitan area would be my decision variables. Let us define xij as the
amount of ethanol shipped from production facility.
• What is my objective? Can it be represented as a linear function of my decision
variables? The problem statement gives the objective to minimize transportation
costs. The objective function would be: ∑ 𝑖𝑖 ∑ 𝑗𝑗 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 which is total
•

transportation cost and is linear with regard to decision variables.
What are the constraints on chosen values of my decision variables? Can they
be represented as linear functions of the decision variables? One set of
constraints is to insure that ethanol shipped from each production facility does
not exceed the available supply: ∑ 𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≤ 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 for each i. A second set of

constraints is to insure demand is met at each metropolitan area: ∑ 𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≥ 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗

for each j metropolitan area. Finally, the flows must all be positive: 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≥ 0.

There are a variety of software packages that can be used for linear programming. For
example, the spreadsheet program EXCEL has a routine for optimization called Solver.
Frontline Systems (2016) has a tutorial available for the use of Solver. Readers
interested in more in-depth treatment of linear programming might consult a relevant
textbook (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004).

5.3 Integer Optimization for Infrastructure Management
In many infrastructure management optimization problems, the decision variables may
be restricted to integer values. For example, in the previous section, decision variables
were defined as undertaking a particular maintenance or rehabilitation action j on a
roadway segment i. While the decision variable could be a fraction, so that only part of
the roadway segment undergoes a maintenance activity, it is more natural to manage
the segment as a whole and wish to have binary decision variables that are zero or one.
Integer constraints impose several problems in obtaining optimal solutions. For linear
programming, optimal values could be sought on the extreme corners of the feasible
region. With integer value constraints, the optimal solution may be inside the feasible
region. As illustrated in Figure 5.2, feasible integer values are shown as dots within a
region satisfying the linear constraints. The only feasible solution on an extreme corner

71

would be the solution x1 = 0 and x2 = 0. Point A marked on the figure would have
fractional values of x1 and x2.

Figure 5.2 - Illustration of Integer Feasible Solutions to a Linear Optimization Problem

Source: Authors

One approach to integer programming is to ignore the integer constraints and solve the
problem as a linear program. With binary restrictions and integer parameters and
constrain values, this approach works frequently to give optimal, binary solutions. A
fractional decision variable value might be rounded by a manager to obtain a very good
but not necessarily strictly optimal solution in this approach. Given the uncertainty in
costs and action effects, the rounding might not affect the overall infrastructure
performance.
More formal methods of obtaining optimal integer solutions also exist. A popular
approach is ‘branch-and-bound.’ In this process, an initial linear solution is obtained,
and then constraints are added to force the solution to be integer. For example, in
Figure 5.2, if point A was obtained as the optimal solution, and good additional
constraint might be to require x1 to be 3 or less: x1 ≤ 3. This would be a new ‘branch’
for the problem solution with a ‘bound’ that cuts out a portion of the region that does not
contain integer values. Adding constraints in this fashion would continue until an integer
valued optimal solution is obtained.
‘Branch and bound’ or other integer programming approaches are part of most popular
optimization software, including the Solver program for the EXCEL spreadsheet.
Integer constraints are specified when problems are input to the programs. However,
solving integer programs requires more calculation time than comparably sized linear
programs. While linear programs with thousands of decision variables can be easily
solved, integer programs may be realistically limited to hundreds of decision variables.
Still, this could well a useful range for many infrastructure management problems.

72

The ‘travelling salesman’ problem is a classic example of an integer programming
problem. The problem is to develop a round-trip tour that visits each and every one of a
set of cities exactly once with minimum travel distance. For infrastructure management,
a tour of this type might be formulated by an inspector of different infrastructure
components or a maintenance worker with a set of assigned jobs. In these problems,
‘cities’ would be inspection or job sites. The UPS routing software for delivery trucks
mentioned in the introduction to this chapter solves this problem (UPS 2016).
Variations of the problem can be found in manufacturing (where ‘cities’ may be spots on
a chip) and DNA sequencing.
A decision variable for the travelling salesman problem might be xij which is 0 if the trip
from i to j is not on the tour and 1 if the trip from i to j is on the tour. The objective
function would be to sum the distance (or cost) of the trip from i to j multiplied by the xij
values. Only those trips which are part of the tour would incur any distance and affect
the value of the objective function. Constraints require that there is exactly one
departure from each city (so the sum of the xij from I equals one) and exactly one arrival
at each city. Additional constraints are needed to insure that the tour is complete (that
is, the tour doesn’t have multiple disjoint circuits). Finally, the decision variables xij are
restricted to zero or one.
Numerous specialized algorithms have been developed for the travelling salesman
problem. In practice, heuristic approaches can obtain very good (but not necessarily
optimal) solutions.

5.4 Non-Linear Optimization
As discussed earlier, most infrastructure management optimization problems are
formulated as linear programming problems. However, in some cases, non-linear
optimization may be needed. The general form of the non-linear optimization problem
is:
Minimize or Maximize f(x) subject to gi(x) ≤ 0 and hj(x) = 0

Eq. 5.7

Where x is a vector of decision variables, f(x) is a non-linear objective function, gi(x) and
hj(x) are sets of constraints which may be linear or non-linear.
One source of non-linearities is that of scale economies in performing a maintenance or
rehabilitation task. This might occur if there are fixed mobilization costs to undertake a
task which are then spread over the amount of work. Components such as tanks also
have scale economies since their volume grows faster than the (expensive) tank
surface as the tank size increases. Figure 5.3 illustrates scale economies in two related
graphs. In the upper graph, the cost per unit of work declining as the amount of work
increases. In the lower graph, the total cost goes up slower than the increase in the
amount of work.
73

Figure 5.3 - Illustration of Scale Economies with respect to the Amount of Work

Another source of non-linearity for infrastructure management comes from flow effects.
For example, roadway traffic congestion is non-linear in that a small increase in traffic
may result in large amounts of delay. With roadway maintenance blocking lanes of
traffic, the capacity of the roadway network is reduced and congestion may increase
considerably. Figure 5.4 illustrates the non-linear increase in average travel time.

74

Figure 5.4 - Illustration of Non-Linear Travel Time Effects with respect to Vehicle Volumes

Source: Authors

Non-linear optimization has some pitfalls. First, solutions obtained may not be global
optimum but only local maximum or minimum values of the objective function. Second,
particular formulations may lead to physically impossible results. For example, in a
case of scale economies, a non-linear optimization may wish to build the top few feet of
a dam rather than the entire dam since the top two feet would hold more water back
than average and would be cheaper to build!
Most non-linear optimization uses some form of a gradient approach in which a set of
feasible decision variable values are chosen and then these are altered to improve the
objective function and still remain feasible. Solver in the spreadsheet program EXCEL
uses this type of technique. In many cases, it is useful to use multiple starting points to
reduce the chance of ending up with a local optimum.
As an example of non-linear optimization useful for infrastructure management, we can
suggest a flow problem which can be applied to traffic flow in road networks or water
flow in pipe networks. The costs of maintenance or rehabilitation work can be estimated
by comparing flow costs before and during network disruption. The same approach can
be used for assessing new capacity or operating procedures. The problem appears in
Hendrickson (1984).
We assume that a network exists with a set of nodes (intersections) N and arcs (pipe
links or streets) A. There is a cost of flow on link ij f(y) which is assumed to be
monotonically increasing as in Figure 5.4. This assumption is physically realistic and
insures convexity for the problem solution space making a solution easier.

75

(𝑘𝑘,𝑗𝑗)∈𝐴𝐴

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 > 0 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 (𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗) ∈ 𝐴𝐴

Equations: 5.8 - 5.10

Where xij is flow on link ij and qk is the net inflow or outflow at node k. The objective is
to minimize ‘impedance’ of flow on each link, and the constraints conserve flow through
nodes and require all flows to be positive.
For pipeline hydraulics applications, the flow would be fluid flow measured in volume
per unit time. The impedance function would be head loss (or gain) per unit of distance.
The impedance function should include elevation differences of nodes as well as pipe
friction loss (through a function such as the Hazen-Williams function 𝑓𝑓 (𝑥𝑥 ) = 𝑘𝑘 ∗ 𝑥𝑥 𝑚𝑚.

For traffic networks, a slightly more complicated form of the problem must be used to
keep track of flows between particular origins and destinations. The impedance is travel
time and relates to total flow on link ij. Problem P2 below shows the traffic flow problem
with the rs notation for traffic from node r to node s, a constraint to insure conservation
of flow through intersection nodes, and a constraint to aggregate the individual origindestination flows for each link.

For the traffic flow application, the solution set of flows represents a ‘user equilibrium
solution’ in which the travel time on each path used between origin r and destination s
has the same overall travel time (if not, travelers would change path and reduce their
travel time). Paths not used between origin r and destination s would have higher travel
time and would be unattractive.
As noted earlier, the problem P2 could be solved to obtain travel times and flows on an
existing network. After the network is altered due to construction, the equilibrium travel
time after the alteration could then be modelled. Noted that in this simple application
form, the origin-destination flow would not change. More elaborate analyses could relax
this assumption to allow new destination or other travel choices.
Gradient solution algorithms exist for problem P1 and P2 that can easily accommodate
thousands of nodes and links. Author, (Hendrickson, 1984) presents one solution
algorithm as well as additional applications of the model form to project task scheduling
and structural analysis. Numerous software programs exist for this type of model
formulation.

5.5 Combining Linear Optimization with Markov Deterioration Models
The previous section illustrated the use of expected component conditions for use in
optimization and decision making. It is also possible to include a distribution of possible
conditions over a period of time. The most common means of making this synthesis is
to combine optimization with Markov deterioration models. A number of bridge and
pavement management systems are based on this synthesis; for an example, see
AASHTO (2016) or Golabi (1997). It is unlikely that an infrastructure manager would
formulate an optimization problem synthesis such as these, but managers regularly use
the software programs embedding the synthesized optimization.
Table 5.1 presents an example of a Markov process transition matrix and possible
actions for a concrete component. Five condition states are defined, with 1
representing good condition and 5 representing failure of the component. For
components in state 1, recommended management action is to do-nothing. In each
year in State 1, there is a 3% chance of deterioration to state 2. For components in
states 2 and 3, do-nothing or patch are possible actions with the probability
consequences as shown. There are substantial chances that the patching may not be
effective, as the components might remain in their initial state or deteriorate further
(although with a low probability of such deterioration). For components in state 4, donothing, rehabilitation or replacement are possible actions. With do-nothing action and
initial state 4, there is a 13% chance of failure over the course of a year.

An initial analysis step with a table of transition probabilities such as this could be to
minimize the long-term cost of maintaining the concrete component. Of course, doing
nothing at each stage would minimize cost, except that eventually the component would
fail. Presumably, a manager would attempt to minimize cost subject to avoiding
transitioning to state 5. Decision variables would be a particular action given a state.
The objective function would be to minimize expected condition (or perhaps the
probability of failure). With a planning horizon and an initial state, the changes in
probabilities over time can be traced as a linear function of the decision variables. A
budge constraint might also be imposed (as in Eq. 5.5) added over all the bridge
components being managed.
We will illustrate this optimization approach with a small problem. Suppose a set of
identical components can have three possible condition states: 1 – good, 2 – average
and 3 – poor. One maintenance activity can be undertaken, which will move the
component from any state to state 1 at a cost of ci. Table 5.2 shows the transition
probabilities for the component with do-nothing and maintenance. Finally, there is a
budget available for the year and a known state si for each component.

Following the formulation approach discussed in the previous section:
•

•
•

Let us define our decision variable as xi = 0 if do-nothing and xi = 1 if
maintenance is performed. (If there were more than two actions possible, then
we could add a subscript as in Eq. 5.3 for each component and each possible
action, and the decision variable xij would be 0 if the action j was not undertaken
on component I and one if action j was taken on component i).
Let us assume that the objective is to minimize the average component
condition.
The only constraint is the budget constraint for all the actions. (If more than one
action is possible, however, we would have to add a constraint similar to Eq. 5.4
for each component however).

The resulting problem is:

Where the objective function has four terms: (1) resulting condition of components in
state 1 with no action, (2) resulting condition of components starting in state 2 with no
action, (3) resulting condition of components in state 3 with no action (they stay in state
3), and (4) components with maintenance moving to state 1. The constraints are the
overall budget and the restriction of the xi to zero or one. As noted above, variation
would add additional potential actions (using notation xis) and different resulting
conditions.

5.6 Exercises
P5.1 (8 pts) Suppose I am managing a system of n cell phone sites. A site consists of
‘antennas and electronic communications equipment placed on a radio mast or tower to
create a cell in a cellular network.’ I have records of the age of the electronic equipment
(ai where a is the current age of the site i) and a physical condition assessment rating (ri
where r is the condition rating index for a site i on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being
excellent) of the physical systems each year. I also have a measure of the importance
of each site, ti where t is the amount of cellular traffic at a particular site i. In each year,
routine maintenance is performed at each site. I can also choose to rehabilitate the
physical site (antenna towers, etc.) (which would move the site to condition 2, replace
the electronic components (which would also move the site to condition 2), or do both
physical rehabilitation and electronic component replacement (which would move the
site to condition 1). Each of these actions has an associated cost, denoted cij where i
indicates a particular site i and j is one of the management strategies.

The union agreement governing acceptable shifts for workers is as follows:
o Each worker is assigned to work either a night shift or a day shift or a late
shift and once a worker has been assigned to a shift they must remain on
the same shift every day that they work.
o Each worker works four consecutive days during any seven day period.
o In total there are currently 60 workers.
Formulate an optimization problem to minimize the number of workers in the

6.1 Introduction
Some infrastructure managers adopt a narrow view of their work, focusing simply on
maintenance and rehabilitation decision making. However, an appreciation and
understanding of the overall performance, costs and finance of infrastructure is
extremely useful in interacting with the users of infrastructure and organizational
decision makers. For example, an extremely congested roadway may be in good
physical condition, but users of the roadway are likely not to appreciate the good
pavement condition while waiting in traffic queues. Figure 6.1 illustrates a roadway in
good condition but with heavy traffic congestion. This chapter is intended to provide an
understanding of the fundamentals of infrastructure costs and finance topics.
The amounts and components of infrastructure costs depend upon your viewpoint. For
a building manager’s viewpoint, costs might be limited to the initial construction (or the
payments for borrowed money used for construction), building utilities and maintenance.
However, the building occupants might incur costs if the roof leaks, power fails or water
is unavailable. If the building has a boiler, then air emissions might impose costs on
nearby residents. The air emissions costs are often called ‘external’ since they don’t
appear on any accounting sheet for the building. However, any public health effects
due to such air emissions represent real social costs. Whenever considering costs, the
appropriate viewpoint should be selected, whether social or private!

6.2 Short Run Cost Functions for Infrastructure
Economists differentiate between short run and long run cost functions. In the short
run, capital facilities are fixed. That is, an infrastructure manager must deal with the
existing facilities. Any major capital project will take a year or more to be implemented
to change facilities. In the long run, capital projects may be implemented, so additional
capacity and facilities may be added.
Short and long run are useful distinctions for developing cost functions, but there are
many cases in which intermediate run cost functions may be needed, when operational
changes might be accomplished. For example, a transit manager may be limited to no
changes in operations in the short run. However, schedule and route changes may be
made without major capital expenditure. Vehicle fleets can be altered with new

84

purchases in a somewhat longer time frame. Over the long run, capital facilities such as
garages, rail lines and busways might be changed.
Costs can be divided into fixed costs of providing a facility and variable costs which
depend upon usage. Fixed costs would be the cost of infrastructure services even
without usage. Examples include:
•
•
•
•

Roadways for transportation
Generating plants, transmission lines and distribution lines for power
Pumps, pipes and storage for water systems
Buildings for office infrastructure.

In many infrastructure cases, these fixed costs may be substantial.
Variable costs are incurred to provide infrastructure use. These costs generally
increase as the amount of usage increases. For example, more maintenance is needed
as the travel volume on a roadway increases. As another example, more building
occupants will result in more power use, bathroom use and elevator trips. In most
infrastructure systems, there are capacity constraints in which the variable cost increase
rapidly as capacity is approached. An example is the roadway congestion shown in
Figure 6.1 in which the user cost of travel is quite high. Buildings often have a
maximum allowable occupancy, but crowding may be uncomfortable even before this
maximum is attained.
Figure 6.2 illustrates the important short fun cost functions of interest for infrastructure
management. The top graph in Figure 6.2 shows a fixed cost (F) even with no usage.
As usage increases, the short run total cost (SRTC(q)) increases, where q is a measure
of usage such as traffic volume. If no capacity constraints or congestion effects exist,
then the SRTC might increase as a straight line.

The bottom graph in Figure 6.2 shows three different short run cost curves:
•

Short Run Average Total Cost is the total cost divided by usage:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞 ) =

•

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞)
.
𝑞𝑞

This curve initially declines as fixed costs are spread

over more usage. Eventually, capacity constraints and congestion result in
higher costs and the SRATC begins to increase. A line drawn from the origin to
the SRTC curve has a slope equal to the short run average total cost. The low
point of the SRATC curve occurs where such a line has minimum slope and is
tangent to the SRTC curve.
Short Run Average Variable Cost is the total cost less fixed cost divided by
usage:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞 ) =

•

[𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞 ) − 𝐹𝐹 ]
𝑞𝑞

This curve increases as capacity constraints and congestion result in higher
costs. In the absence of such effects, the SRAVC(q) would be a flat, horizontal
line.
Short Run Marginal Cost is the derivative of the SRTC with respect to q (or
approximately the change in total cost from an additional unit of usage:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞 ) =

𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿(𝑞𝑞)
𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿

≈

[𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞)−𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞−1)]
𝑞𝑞

. The SRMC begins at a low

value and increases as capacity constraints and congestion effects. The SRMC
crosses the SRATC curve at its lowest, inflection point. Beyond this point, the
marginal cost of additional usage exceeds the average cost.
As noted in the introduction, these various cost curves will differ depending upon the
analysis viewpoint adopted. The major changes occur if external and user costs are
included or not included. For a roadway system, user costs would include vehicle
operating costs, travel time opportunity cost and potential costs from crashes. Vehicle
operating costs include taxes that support roadway maintenance and construction in
many cases. Travel time opportunity cost will likely vary with the income (or wealth) of
the traveler and the opportunities foregone. A passenger in an autonomous, self-driving
vehicle might have low travel time opportunity cost since the passenger could be doing
activities other than driving. External costs would include air emissions effects,
congestion and crash costs. Many of these ‘external’ costs are external to any
individual traveler but are borne by other travelers. For example, an additional vehicle
may add congestion that is a travel time penalty for the other vehicles on the road.
For telecommunications infrastructure, these cost functions would differ by type of
technology used. For broadcast, over-the-air radio and television stations, all costs are
fixed and no congestion effects occur so the SRTC function would be a horizontal line.

87

As many users can listen or watch as are in the area being served. This is an unusual
situation and represents a ‘public’ good in the parlance of economics in which users
cannot be easily excluded and do not interfere with other users. In contrast, cellular
service infrastructure has capacity limits in base units, so greater usage imposes user
costs in the form of inferior service.

6.3 Demand Fluctuation with Low, Medium and High Usage Situations
As noted earlier, low usage is usually associated with declining average costs as fixed
costs are spread over more users. For medium usage, the average costs are fairly flat
and don’t change dramatically. With high usage, capacity constraints and congestion
come into play and the average costs begin to increase.
Usage of infrastructure systems tends to vary considerably over time and over
geography. As a result, costs also tend to vary considerably. As an example, Figure
6.3 illustrates a typical variation in traffic volumes by time of day, with the peak travel
occurring the morning and the late afternoon. Roadway congestion is heaviest in these
peak hours of travel. As another example, Figure 6.4 illustrates typical electricity
demand by time of day for two different months. In this case, there is variation in
demand over the course of a day, but it is not as extreme a fluctuation as for roadway
traffic. Figure 6.4 also shows that electricity demand varies over the course of a year,
with higher demand in the summer likely due to air conditioning use.

Infrastructure managers often must respond to these fluctuating demands. In many
cases, maintenance activities are scheduled for low usage periods to avoid imposing
costs. For example, building floors may be cleaned at night. As another example,
power grid managers must respond to not only varying demand (as shown in Figure
6.4), but also varying supply as solar and wind generators respond to environmental
conditions.
Another important variation in demand for many infrastructure systems occurs over
time, from year to year or over the course of decades. For example, demand for water
will typically increase with an increase in population. Demand for electricity will also
typically increase with population, but may also depend upon the numbers of
households being served, incomes and new technologies. New technologies may
reduce demand (with more energy efficient refrigerators for example) or increase
demand (with battery electric vehicles or fancier entertainment systems).
To the extent that cost functions represent user costs, then the cost functions shown in
Figure 6.2 can be coupled with demand functions to estimate equilibrium demand for
service. Figure 6.5 illustrates a linear user cost and demand curve for a service. The
89

equilibrium demand occurs at the intersection of the two curves with usage qe and user
cost pe. Of course, demand is likely to be varying over time, so the equilibrium demand
and user costs will similarly vary.

6.4 Budgets and Revenues from Usage
In addition to the cost implications of different levels of infrastructure usage, there is
often a revenue effect. Many infrastructure systems obtain revenues from user fees
such as power sales or gasoline taxes. In turn, budgets for infrastructure maintenance
and rehabilitation rely upon these revenues. The alternative to using user fees is to rely
on general taxation of some sort, but this is only feasible for public infrastructure.
Generally, user fees can be set at any level. A few cases of user fee strategies are of
interest:
•

•

Set user fees equal to the short run average total cost of providing the
infrastructure. In this case, the infrastructure provider is fully funded and
compensated for the infrastructure service costs.
Set user fees equal to an amount that maximizes total revenue. This strategy
can be pursued with an optimization problem to maximize revenue (p*q where p

90

•

•

is user fee and q is equilibrium usage) subject to the demand function (q = f(p,x)
where f(p,x) is a demand function with usage dependent upon the user fee and
other factors x). Even with a maximizing revenue strategy, usage may not be
sufficiently high to cover all agency costs. For example, the Pennsylvania
turnpike has increased tolls every year from 2008 to 2016 and made transfer
payments to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but the managers feel that the
revenues are insufficient in the long run to maintain the system effectively and
make required transfer payments (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2016).
Set user fees in accord with user’s willingness-to-pay. Demand curves reflect
individual’s willingness-to-pay for infrastructure services. If the user cost function
shifted up in Figure 6.5, some usage would disappear but a remaining amount of
usage demand would continue at higher user cost. With a single user cost, the
revenue would be roughly 𝑞𝑞𝑒𝑒 ∗ 𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑒 in figure 6.5 (less any user costs incurred
directly rather than as a service price). Perfect price discrimination would gain
revenue equal to the complete area under the demand curve in Figure 6.5 (again
less any user costs incurred directly). However, individuals don’t usually reveal
their willingness-to-pay for service and there are restrictions on discriminating
among different types of users. Indirect methods can be adopted, however, such
as lower airline fares for earlier purchases or for trips involving a Saturday night
stay. Business travelers with a higher willingness-to-pay tend to make late
purchases and not stay at destinations over a weekend.
Set user fees equal to short run marginal cost. This is a common economics
prescription because this strategy will minimize overall costs as long as the short
run marginal cost function includes all relevant social costs (including
externalities). Users would be paying exactly the cost associated with their
service use. Unfortunately, it is difficult to impose short run marginal cost pricing
exactly since demand fluctuates so much. An example of approximating this
policy appears in Figure 6.6, where toll on a roadway in San Diego CA increase
during peak periods of travel demand. By increasing tolls, some users would be
diverted from the roadway and congestion costs avoided.

6.5 Life Cycle Costs, Taxes and Finance of Infrastructure
For long term rehabilitation investment planning, a life cycle viewpoint is normally used.
‘Life cycle’ in this context generally refers to a planning horizon for investments and not
necessarily the obsolescence of some infrastructure. In performing life cycle analysis,
you must select an appropriate planning horizon, a discount rate to account for the time
value of money, and forecast benefits and costs of the infrastructure over the course of
the planning horizon.
Selection of a planning horizon and a discount rate are often organizational choices, so
most infrastructure managers need not be concerned with these two inputs. For the
US, any project involving federal dollars must use the discount rate chosen by the US
Office of Management and Budget (OMB, 2015). In the absence of organizational
guidance, an infrastructure manager might use a discount rate reflecting marketplace
long term borrowing rates and a planning horizon consistent with the expected useful
lifetime of the infrastructure. For example, a planning horizon for a building might be
fifty years, while a cellular hub might be ten years.

Even formulation of the short run cost functions discussed earlier can involve life cycle
cost analysis to estimate the fixed costs of infrastructure in each period. Infrastructure
typically requires an initial large capital expenditure for construction, and this fixed cost
is usually annualized to uniform amounts to obtain the fixed costs allocated to any year
of operation. The formula for anualization of an initial cost P to uniform amounts U over
a planning period with n compounding periods at a discount rate I is (Au, 1992):
𝑖𝑖(1+𝑖𝑖)𝑛𝑛

𝑈𝑈 = 𝑃𝑃 �(1+𝑖𝑖)𝑛𝑛−1�

Equation 6.1

Where U is uniform annualized amount, P is the present expenditure, i is a discount rate
and n is the planning horizon (or technically the number of compounding periods). This
process is equivalent to that of assuming a mortgage on the infrastructure component in
which the entire construction cost is borrowed at an interest rate of i and a repayment
period of n years.
Why isn’t the uniform amount simply the value P divided by the number of payment
𝑃𝑃
periods, ? The use of a discount rate reflects the ‘time value of money.’ Lenders
𝑛𝑛
usually require a return on their lending, so they charge an interest rate. Individuals
always prefer receiving money in the present rather than an equivalent amount in the
future. The amount of extra required to make a future amount equivalent is a personal
discount rate. Organizational discount rates are typically set with reference to the
market equilibrium for long term borrowing.
In addition to the initial capital construction expenditure, infrastructure will often have
major expenditures associated with rehabilitation. Figure 6.7 illustrates this type of
rehabilitation. The pavement condition deteriorates during use and weathering until a
rehabilitation occurs. The rehabilitations have lower cost than the initial construction
and take place over the service lifetime of the pavement. For discussion of methods of
estimating such costs, see Hendrickson (2008).

How can these rehabilitation expenses be converted into a uniform annual cost? The
most direct means is to find the present value of such costs over the infrastructure
lifetime by discounting future costs:
𝑛𝑛

𝑃𝑃 = � 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 (1 + 𝑖𝑖 )−𝑡𝑡
(𝑡𝑡=𝑜𝑜)

Equation 6.2

Where P is present value, t is a time index, n is the planning horizon, Ft is the cost
incurred in year t, and i is the discount rate. Uniform costs can then be obtained using
Equation 6.1.
As a numerical example, suppose the costs illustrated in Figure 6.7 are estimated as
shown in Table 6.1. With a 30 year planning horizon and a 1% discount rate, the life
cycle costs (in $ million) would be:
P = Initial Construction Cost + Discounted First and Second
Rehabilitation + Discounted Maintenance Cost

construction might be added.

Inflation and deflation will affect life cycle cost analysis if current dollars are used for
analysis. With inflation, the purchasing value of a unit of currency declines over time;
deflation reflects an increase in the value of a currency. Current dollar amounts can be
converted to ‘real’ or base year dollar amounts by applying an inflation index
adjustment: Indexbase year / Indext or by discounting using Eq. 6.2 and the expected rate
of inflation. Different types of infrastructure have their own inflation indexes or a general
index such as the gross domestic product index can be used. Life cycle cost estimates
are generally made in base year ‘real’ dollars. Financial agreements for payments such
as mortgages usually are based upon current dollars. With these mixed dollar amounts,
you should apply an inflation calculator to convert to one type of dollar amounts.
Discount rates also can be for constant ‘real’ dollars or for current inflated dollars. The
relationship is:
I’ = I + j + ij

Equation 6.4

Where I’ is the annual discount rate including inflation (for current dollar discounting), I
is the real discount rate, and j is the inflation rate. Readers unfamiliar with these
engineering economics calculations can refer to Au (1992) or other textbooks.
For investment decisions, the life cycle costs can be compared to the life cycle benefits
in a similar fashion by placing the costs and benefits into present values. In this case,
you can examine the net present value of an investment: NPV = Pbenefit – Pcost. With a
series of mutually exclusive infrastructure design or rehabilitation options, you might
select the one that maximizes this net present value.
Spreadsheet or numerical analysis software is readily available to perform the
engineering economics calculations for analyzing life cycle costs. For a spreadsheet, a
separate row (or if you prefer a separate column) is used for each period and the costs

95

and benefits recorded. The discounting functions in Equations 6.1 and 6.2 are usually
already available in the software.

6.6 Long Run Investment Decisions and Cost Functions
It is possible to also develop long run cost functions in which the infrastructure itself may
be changed to maximize net present value. In particular, rather than incur the high
costs of congestion in high usage situations (as in Figure 6.3), an infrastructure
manager might add capacity as rehabilitation investments are made.
The long run total cost curve is the lower cost envelope of all possible short run total
cost options. Figure 6.8 illustrates the situation in which two possible infrastructure
capacity options exist (which might represent different size components, an additional
floor on a parking garage or an additional lane of roadway capacity). There is a usage
point (qb) in Figure 6.8 at which it is desirable to shift from option 1 to the larger capacity
option 2. The long run average total cost has a significant turn at this usage breakpoint,
with scale economies beginning again! The long run marginal cost curve has a
discontinuity at the breakpoint. With lower demand (demand curve D), the smaller
option has lower costs, but with higher demand (demand curve D’), the larger option 2 is
more desirable.

6.7 Decision Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation for Investment Decisions
The earlier discussion in this chapter noted the effects of demand fluctuations, but did
not address uncertainty and contingencies. However, costs and demands are likely to
be quite uncertain to forecast. Moreover, external events such as extreme events may
also profoundly affect infrastructure costs, demand and usage.
A common approach to dealing with uncertainty is to employ some form of ‘Monte Carlo’
simulation, where the name ‘Monte Carlo’ refers to a casino in Monaco with gambling
on chance events. Monte Carlo simulation requires not only cash flow estimates in
97

each year, but also the probabilistic distributions of such cash flows as input
information. As a result, there is considerably more work to prepare input (which is
expensive and still uncertain) and to perform calculations (which fortunately is not very
expensive with modern information technology).
The essential idea of Monte Carlo simulation is to obtain a sample from input parameter
distributions and then assess the outcome from this sample. This process of sampling
and assessment is repeated numerous times, resulting in a distribution of possible
outcomes. So rather than a fixed, deterministic estimate of life cycle costs, Monte Carlo
simulation results in a probability distribution of possible life cycle costs.
As an example, suppose you decided to do a Monte Carlo simulation of the life cycle
roadway cost shown in Table 6.1 and Equation 6.3. The parameters in Table 6.1 might
be used as input for a Monte Carlo roadway life cycle cost analysis with the following
assumptions:

Monte Carlo Simulation (Note: N(μ, σ) is normal distribution with mean μ and standard
deviation σ, and U[i,u] is the uniform distribution with lower bound i and upper bound u).
The assumed parameter distributions are either normal or uniform with the mean equal
to the values in Table 6.2. As a reminder, Figure 6.9 illustrates a normal distribution
with different parameter values. To perform the Monte Carlo simulation, numerous
samples (perhaps 500) would be drawn from the relevant distributions, each to form a
single example case, and then Equation 6.3 applied to calculate life cycle costs for that
case. The result would be numerous observations of possible life cycle costs.

Many software programs easily accommodate Monte Carlo simulation, including the
Excel spreadsheet and Matlab. These software programs have regular functions or
subprograms to generate random samples from input distributions. Monte Carlo
simulations find use in a variety of application domains beyond infrastructure
management, including environmental life cycle assessment and production planning.
While Monte Carlo simulation explicitly considers uncertainty with stochastic inputs, it is
crucially dependent upon the correctness of these input assumptions and modelling the
effects of inputs. Accurately knowing the distributions of infrastructure costs and usage
is unlikely. Users of Monte Carlo simulation should be aware of the classic computer
adage: ‘garbage in, garbage out.’ Just because the results come from a complicated
computer program, inaccurate inputs will not result in accurate results.
Another approach to exploring the effects of uncertainty is to use scenario and decision
analysis. For our roadway cost example, scenario analysis might pertain to major
underlying usage influences or natural disasters. For example, new industrial
development in the roadway vicinity may result in much larger usage and faster
pavement deterioration. As another example, major rehabilitation may be required in
the case of earthquakes. Each of these situations may be a different scenario with
different life cycle costs as a consequence. The scenarios might each have a Monte
Carlo simulation analysis with different assumptions about input distributions.

99

Decision analysis would go further and include probabilities associated with different
scenarios. Each scenario might also have different assumptions about future actions,
such as a decision to widen the roadway in connection with a rehabilitation action. For
this decision analysis approach, common applications would include both cost and
benefit assessments to evaluate net present value effects.

7.1 Introduction
Infrastructure managers may go long periods of time without significant failures,
extreme events or security breaches occurring for their infrastructure. However, a
manager must be prepared to deal with such events and should plan ahead to mitigate
the potential costs of such events. This chapter discusses approaches to prepare for
and to mitigate the damages of such events.
The list of potential adverse events is long indeed:
•
•
•

Critical infrastructure failure, such as electricity, water supply,
telecommunications, etc.,
Extreme events, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, landslides,
lightning strikes, tornadoes, etc., and
Security problems, such as bombs, guns, computer hacking, riots, etc.

News media regularly report such events throughout the world on a daily basis. Even
the resignation or retirement of an employee with critical management knowledge can
reveal a lack of resiliency in management.
While the chance of occurrence for any of these events is quite low in any particular
year, the probability is typically not zero. The exception might be physically impossible
occurrences such as flooding to a facility at the top of a hill (but then the top of the hill
may be more prone to have high wind!). Figure 7.1 illustrates the estimates of
probabilities of significant (magnitude greater than 6.7) earthquakes in California. The
figure outlines the boundaries of California in white and the various earthquake fault
lines show up as higher probability linear segments. The probability scale ranges from
10-6 (0.0001% chance per year) in blue to 10-2 (1% chance per year) in purple. While
these particular estimates are uncertain, California infrastructure managers should be
prepared for an earthquake event!

102

Figure 7.1 - Estimated Probability of Significant Earthquakes per Year in California

Even with a low probability of an event occurring, the number of repetitions of the
underlying risk opportunity may result in a significant risk. For example, suppose your
risk of falling from a scaffold is 0.1% in any particular day, which likely seems like a
small risk to you. However, if you are on a scaffold 365 days a year, the probability of a
fall over the course of a year would be (as discussed in Chapter 4):

𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟 {𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 } = 1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟 {𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 }365 = 1 − 0.69 = 0.31

Equation 7.1

So you would have a 31% chance of a fall over the course of a year spent on
scaffolding. Over fifteen years, the probability of a fall would increase to 99.6%.
Similarly, riding a bike to and from work might have a low probability of experiencing a
crash, but over a long period of time the likelihood of a crash increases. Better risk
management might make changes such as safety straps on scaffolding or dedicated
bike lanes. The result would be to lower the daily probability of an event considerably.
In addition to the chance of occurrence, the other dimension of risk management is to
consider the severity of consequences for an event. A small flood may have some

103

costs, but an organization could likely recover its infrastructure services rather quickly.
In contrast, a large flood or a terrorist attack could have major consequences, including
subsequent legal procedures. Similarly, small earthquakes or wildfires may have limited
impacts, but a large earthquake or fire could require major rehabilitation or rebuilding.
Infrastructure managers should prepare for events with high frequency and low impact
such as heavy rainstorms. For example, a large company with multiple oil platforms in
the Gulf of Mexico should be prepared to secure and evacuate the platforms regularly
due to hurricanes. But managers also need to prepare for high impact, low probability
events such as earthquakes. Fortunately, high impact and high probability risks are
rare. Also, low impact and small probability events are less of a concern than these
other categories. Figure 7.2 illustrates the disruption probability and consequences for
several organizational threats.

Figure 7.3 - Risks for Water and Wastewater Systems

Good infrastructure design and construction can significantly reduce the consequences
of many risks. For example, earthquake resistant facility design has become required in
earthquake prone areas. Similarly, adequate storm water systems (and good
preventive maintenance) can reduce the risk of flooding.
105

7.2 Infrastructure Interdependencies
Infrastructure is interconnected, interdependent, and Complex. Infrastructure systems
have complex connections and interdependencies that can lead to cascading failures.
In many cases, infrastructure systems depend upon services provided by other
infrastructure. For example, if electricity supply is disrupted, then water supplies may
be affected since pumps and treatment plants require electricity. If gasoline stations
and oil pipelines depend upon the power grid for electricity, then transportation services
may be disruped. Second order effects can also occur. For example, if electricity
supply failure occurs and affects water supplies, then agriculture will be affected and
eventually banking and finance will have an effect. Figure 7.4 illustrates some of the
interdependencies among six infrastructure services.
Geographic proximity can also result in infrastructure interdependencies. All the
infrastructure on a flood plain may be vulnerable to a flood event. Similarly, an
earthquake can disrupt multitude infrastructure systems, including bridges, buildings,
pipelines, electricity transmission lines, fiber optic cables, ports and roadways.

Figure 7.4 - Illustration of Infrastructure Interdependencies

Source: Rinaldi, 2001. Redrawn and altered by Authors. Note: SCADA is Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition.

106

Of course, infrastructure managers may be responsible for only one particular type of
infrastructure. For example, a building manager usually relies upon the power grid for
electricity, the local water supply utility for water, a telecommunications company for
telephone and internet, and suppliers for a variety of resources. However, a building
manager can estimate the likelihood and consequences of disruptions. Moreover,
planning ahead can reduce the consequences of disruptions. Backup power systems
for essential services (such as lighting) or back up communications capability can be
installed in the building.
Modern communications and information technology has become pervasive in the
provision of infrastructure services. Note that supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) and communications has the most occurrences among the interdependencies
shown in Figure 7.3. Telecommunications companies need to be ready for rapid
response to restore services in the event of disruptions to avoid cascading effects.

7.3 Improving Infrastructure Resiliency
Infrastructure resiliency is the capability to restore infrastructure to its original state after
a disruption occurs. Improved resiliency can be achieved with planning for disruptions
and having resources available to respond to disruptions. Figure 7.5 illustrates the
various time periods. Prior to an incident or disaster, preparations can be made. At the
time of an incident, the infrastructure performance degrades, especially as failures
propagate through associated components. In extreme cases, the infrastructure
performance may degrade to closure (so I would equal zero in Figure 7.5). A recovery
period ensues until the infrastructure returns to normal performance.

Faster Recovery

Table 7.1 lists some strategies to improve resiliency along with technical, organizational,
social and economic examples. The strategies are:
•
•
•
•

Robustness may refer to facility design and construction but also includes good
planning for emergencies and rehearsals.
Redundancy includes strategies such as back-up power and lifeline resources
such as food and water.
Resourcefulness involves the resources that can be mobilized in response to an
event.
Rapidity is the speed at which restoration can occur.

As an example of resiliency planning, consider an electricity utility. The utility can insure
redundancy in transmission lines and power generation sources. Individual facilities
can be design and built to withstand significant stresses. With major storms forecast,
crews with equipment and supplies can be pre-positioned to respond to any outages
rapidly. While the utility may still see disruptions, all of these activities will improve the
resiliency of the utility.
Another example is planning for evacuation effectively. Figure 7.6 shows a 2005
evacuation of Houston due to forecast hurricane. During this evacuation, roadway
lanes in to the city have been reversed to increase the available capacity.
Unfortunately, the traffic volumes resulted in major traffic jams. Improved entry controls
onto the highway could eliminate this type of jam.

109

Climate change and sea level rise are two factors that are increasing the importance of
infrastructure resiliency. As average sea level increases, the likelihood of flooding
increases. A variety of new strategies may be required, as with the response to
Hurricane Sandy that flooded portions of the New York subway system.
Finally, the use of scenario analysis (as described in Chapter 6) may be useful for
planning. A regular session to consider possible risks, preparedness, and
documentation of procedures can be extremely useful.

7.4 Infrastructure Security
Security has become a major concern for infrastructure managers. Infrastructure
systems have been targets of terrorist attacks, such as the attack on building facilities
using airplanes by agents of Al-Qaeda on September 11, 2001. Numerous other
examples exist, such as bombs place in subway systems and railcars. Theft is also a
security concern for infrastructure systems.

110

Responses to improve security have been widespread. Physical barriers have been
erected to prevent vehicles or unauthorized individuals to come onto vulnerable
infrastructure. Surveillance for suspicious activity has been increased. Communication
protocols with law enforcement agencies have been refined.
For an infrastructure manager, the key questions to ask are:
•
•
•

What are the major risks facing my system?
How can these risks be reduced?
How much should be invested in security versus other resource needs?

The most frequent security threat is due to computer hacking. It is not uncommon to
have numerous hacking attempts on a local network per day. Much of this activity is
intended to reveal financial information, but some of it is malicious. As noted earlier,
many infrastructure systems rely upon SCADA systems and communications software
for operation, so the infrastructure services may be vulnerable to such attacks.
Investment in good personnel and software protection is critical for such services.

7.5 Preparing for and Responding to Emergencies
Organizations should be prepared to respond to emergency situations. These
situations may arise from a multitude of sources, including natural and man-made
hazards. Large emergencies typically involve multiple infrastructure systems and large
populations, so co-ordination with emergency services and managers is critical.
A few elements of preparation can be noted. First, a communications strategy should
be in place. This strategy should include means of communicating with infrastructure
users and response personnel. For example, a broadcast strategy of emergency
communications via email and text messaging should be in place. The broadcast
mechanism should be regularly tested.
A second component of emergency preparation is a decision making strategy. Who is
empowered to make decisions in event of an emergency? Successors should also be
identified in case the primary decision maker is not available.
In an emergency, knowledge of available resources may be critical. Where and what
resources and emergencies supplies are positioned can be important information to aid
effective decision making.
As noted earlier, pre-positioning personnel, equipment and supplies can be a very
effective preparation strategy. Temporary bridges, transformers, power lines and the
like can be all readied for rapid deployment.
Temporary facilities may also be needed for emergency operations. Shelters can be
assembled for individuals made homeless by fires or other destruction. Dirt runways
111

can be used for delivery of emergency supplies by air. Temporary cellular telephone
and Wi-Fi stations can be moved in and installed rapidly.
Response to emergencies generally requires immediate attention from all the members
of the infrastructure management team. Innovation, co-ordination and rapid decision
making are necessary elements of a successful response!

7.6 Exercises
P7.1 (10pts) Using the latest EPA E-GRID ‘Power Flows’ spreadsheet available on the
internet, you will find electricity export and import estimates for all of the states in the
US.
a) What are top 5 importing and exporting states in terms of GWh? What about in terms
of percent of state consumption? What are the reasons why states may import
significant amounts of electricity?
b) Focus on the twelve Western United States. Does the western grid region come
close to providing a 'zero balance' of imported and exported power? If not, what might
be the cause of the net import or net export of this entire region?
c) Make a small optimization model to estimate the power flows in the 12 Western US
states (i.e. try to match up the importing and exporting states and make the overall
power flow balance). If necessary, use import/export data for a ‘super’ region located
near Chicago to help your balance. Make a summary table, spreadsheet, etc. that
shows where states get their imported power from (or export to). Assume that utilities
try to minimize the transport cost of electricity, which is roughly proportional to distance
between states; you can use a rough estimate of distance accurate to the nearest 500
miles. Report your results as a matrix in which entries represent the estimated flow
between states and column and row totals represent exports and imports of power
given from e-grid.
d) Let us simulate a storm along the west coast, with all transmission capability among
WA, OR and CA knocked out (so these three inter-state distributions are set to zero.
Other inter-state distributions are ok as well as in-state generation.). Re-estimate your
flows for this case. What has changed, if anything?

8.1 Introduction
Contract and workflow management are often major time commitments for infrastructure
managers. Contract management is the process of ordering and monitoring outside
organizations to do some work required for infrastructure management. Workflow
management is the process of organizing and scheduling tasks related to infrastructure
management. The extent to which tasks are contracted out will depend upon the
internal resources available for infrastructure management.
As with many processes, information technology aids are available and useful for both
contract and workflow management. As tasks are defined, they can be logged into a
database, monitored and progress recorded. Contract documents and records are quite
likely to be kept digitally by both the principal and the contractor. Either specialized or
general purpose software can be used for these purposes.
Of course, contract and workflow management is not limited to the domain of
infrastructure management. Large firms such as Amazon have very sophisticated
financial, inventory and order tracking software. The transportation provider firm Uber
has large numbers of contractor drivers as well as suppliers. Similarly, hospitals have
systems in place for contracting and workflow management. We will focus on
contracting and workflow management for infrastructure, although the processes are
similar for other applications (Monczka et. al 2015; Van Der Aalst and Kees, 2004).

8.2 Contract Management
Contracting with outside organizations to perform infrastructure management tasks is
both common and useful. Contracting has several advantages relative to performing all
tasks within the infrastructure owner organization:
•

•

Can provide more resources for peak work period demands. For example, major
rehabilitation projects require significant resources of equipment and manpower
which are typically beyond the regular resources in an ongoing infrastructure
management organization. As a result, rehabilitation work is usually contracted
out.
Can provide access to specialized knowledge and equipment. Outside
organizations can specialize in a particular area such as elevator or roof
inspection, for which expertise is not needed year-round for the infrastructure
114

management organization. Similarly, road repaving is generally contracted out
rather than maintaining specialized paving equipment in a municipality.
At the same time, contracting incurs costs for contact management and payments of
profits to contractors.
Contracts come in a bewildering variety of forms. They can have many different
payment terms and risk allocation provisions (Hendrickson, 2007). They typically vary
between countries, organizations and type of work. They are also subject to complex
legal forms and reviews. By and large, actual contract documents are prepared by a
legal department or a professional organization and contract provisions are re-used
extensively, so individual infrastructure managers do not need to draft new contract
documents.
The important stages in contracting are shown in Figure 8.1 and discussed briefly
below. Not all of these stages will occur in every contracting process. For example,
contract modifications may not be required in many cases.
1. Requirements definition is a process to specify the work desired from the
contractor. For a major rehabilitation project, this definition may require a
significant component design process.
2. Contracting strategy formulation is series of decisions about the contracting
process, such as pricing and time frame requirements.
3. Pre-Qualification is a process of selecting a group of potential contractors. Prequalification may be a subjective judgment by a manager or may be a formal
process of application and qualification reviews. In many cases, infrastructure
managers may have long term relationships with contractors and build up
confidence and trust in their capabilities.
4. Request for a quote or proposal from potential contractors. The request will
usually include pricing parameters and desired time frame for the work. Pricing
options include fixed price, cost plus profit, guaranteed maximum price, and unit
cost. Unit cost pricing is useful for ongoing contracts with numerous tasks. For
example, a unit cost pricing for roadway repaving might have a price per lanemile of repaving.
5. Negotiation and selection of a contractor can take many forms. A classic,
competitive fixed bid approach receives monetary bids from pre-qualified
contractors and awards the work on the basis of lowest costs. The infrastructure
manager may also negotiate terms with multiple potential contractors and
eventually award the contract to the most desirable terms.
6. Inspection and Quality Assurance is a post-award task to insure that the work is
done to the desired requirements.

115

7. Contract modification is a common process. During the course of work, the
desired requirements may change or unforeseen circumstances dictate different
approaches. Contractors will typically be willing to negotiate contract
modifications in response.
8. Payments and reporting are processes that make periodic and final payments to
contractors as well as documenting the entire process.

Allocation of risks between contractors, owners and other interest parties is an
important issue in contracting. Risk allocation becomes important whenever
unexpected events occur. For example, the required work may be more extensive than
originally expected and then the question arises: who will pay for the extra work? A
partial list of responsibilities with concomitant risk that can be assigned to different
parties would include (Hendrickson, 2007):

Force majeure (i.e., this provision absolves an owner or a contractor for payment
for costs due to "Acts of God" and other external events such as war or labor
strikes).
Indemnification (i.e., this provision absolves the indemnified party from any
payment for losses and damages incurred by a third party such as adjacent
property owners.).
Liens (i.e., assurances that third party claims are settled such as "mechanics
liens" for worker wages).
Labor laws (i.e., payments for any violation of labor laws and regulations on the
job site).
Differing site conditions (i.e., responsibility for extra costs due to unexpected site
conditions).
Delays and extensions of time.
Liquidated damages (i.e., payments for any facility defects with payment
amounts agreed to in advance).
Consequential damages (i.e., payments for actual damage costs assessed upon
impact of facility defects).
Occupational safety and health of workers, including insurance provisions and
payments in the event of safety damages.
Permits, licenses, laws, and regulations. It is often difficult to know exactly what
permits may be required.
Equal employment opportunity regulations.
Termination for default by contractor.
Suspension of work.
Warranties and guarantees.

8.3 Workflow Management
Infrastructure management involves long term cycles of asset management planning
and implementation, often for periods of a year or even longer. But another aspect of
infrastructure management is dealing with the day to day desired work tasks. For
example, on a military base, a campus or a large building, there will be requests for
repair and re-stocking tasks as well as scheduled activities such as inspection and
maintenance. Workflow management is the process of identifying these tasks,
assigning tasks to workers (or contractors), setting priorities among tasks, and
documenting the resulting work. Analysis of workflow tasks is also a useful activity, as
problems can be identified (e.g. which elevator is breaking down most often?) and
worker productivity monitored.
Work tasks may have a variety of forms and involve distinct skills. For example, author
Don Coffelt’s facility management group provides the following services to campus
departments:
•
•

Heating and air conditioning
Carpentry

117

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Custodial services
Roof and gutter repair
Electrical repairs
Window washing
Elevator maintenance
Gardening
Pest Control
Plumbing
Meeting setup
Trash and recycling
Painting
Locksmith

In addition to service requests from departments, there are a large number of tasks
generated from the facilities management group itself, such as ice and snow clearance
and preventive maintenance. Figure 8.2 illustrates a typical preventive maintenance
task, in this case clearing debris from a stormwater sewer sump. Departmental
payments may also be required for work flow tasks, such as changing locks in the
events of lost or misplaced keys.

118

Figure 8.2 - Example of a Contracted Preventive Maintenance Task

Source: Authors. Vacuuming out debris in a storm water sewer sump avoids clogging and
reduced flow volumes.

Setting priorities among tasks is an important component of workflow management
strategy. If tasks are simply handled in a first come, first served basis, then critical
tasks such as safety hazards may be neglected. At the same time, a general buildup of
unfulfilled tasks may require special efforts to catch up, such as contracting out more
tasks or hiring more staff.
As with many aspects of infrastructure management, software and communication aids
are available for workflow management. Service requests can be made directly and
digitally, rather than using paper or telephone requests. Task completion can be
documented by workers using mobile devices. Databases can track the status of tasks.
Geographic information and computer aided design software can help route planning or
identifying problem areas.

9.1 Introduction
Commissioning is a process of transforming a completed construction project into a
functioning and useful infrastructure system. The construction project might be a
complete new facility, a major new piece of equipment, a facility addition or a major
rehabilitation. The tendency of construction project managers is to focus on simply
completing the construction process itself. Commissioning is intended to insure that
the new construction operates as planned and that the new facility can continue to
operate with regular infrastructure management. So commissioning is an important
although likely infrequent activity for infrastructure managers.
New facilities can be quite complex, with a variety of systems needed to be
commissioned. Electronics, mechanical equipment, software controls, and even
components such as windows need to be tested and operation plans for asset
management developed. An example of a complicated machine room is shown in
Figure 9.1.

121

Figure 9.1 - Example of a Complex Machine Room

For larger projects, a specialized manager for the commissioning process may be
retained. This manager would be responsible for insuring that all the major
commissioning tasks are completed adequately. A challenging aspect of the
commissioning agent’s job is that the construction organization(s), the infrastructure
manager, the facility users and the facility owner must all be satisfied and involved.
Major steps in the commissioning process include:
1. Preparation and planning involves identifying tasks, individual responsibilities and
required documentation.
2. Completion and integrity testing involves comparison of as-built and as designed
plans, often using computer aided design or facility information models.
3. Operational testing involves preliminary testing of equipment and software as
built in the facility. This initial testing may rely upon construction or equipment
supplier professionals, but should also involve the future operators of the
equipment.
4. Start-up and Initial Operation involves actual use of the facility with monitoring to
insure that the new facility is operating as planned.

122

5. Performance testing occurs during use to assess the overall performance of
systems such as heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems in new
buildings.
6. Post commissioning occurs when the regular infrastructure management
procedures are in place and operating smoothly.
Of course, commissioning may not always go smoothly, and additional construction or
adjustment tasks might be required in addition to the steps outlined above.

9.2 Testing New Facilities
Adequately testing the systems in new facilities can be difficult. While turning a system
on will reveal basic operating information, it does not provide a test of operation under
the various conditions that the facility will encounter during years of service. Moreover,
some systems are intended for operation under extreme conditions of heavy rain, high
wind or fire. Testing under these conditions would be costly and hazardous! For most
commissioning procedures, testing of all operational modes is normal but usually not
under all field conditions. For example, heating, ventilating and air conditioning in a new
building would all be tested, even if only heating was required at the time of testing.
Some special tests that would not be part of normal operations may also be useful. For
example, a fan pressurization test may be performed on a new building. With a higher
pressure in the building provided by a fan, the extent of air leakage can be measured as
the flow required to maintain the pressure differential. Figure 9.2 shows some possible
features that could have air leakage and might be addressed as part of the final
construction and commissioning activities. As another example, emergency vehicles
might test new tunnels for any problems (either virtually in three dimensional models or
in reality).

9.3 Documenting New Facilities
Documentation of the new facility is an important part of commissioning. The
manufacturer and construction personnel will be passing system control over to the
infrastructure management organization, and they may not be familiar with the
intricacies of the new facility.
Three dimensional computer aided design or facility information models are usually
prepared prior to new facility construction. However, there are often modifications to the
original design during the course of construction. As a result, as-built three dimensional
models are often required for commissioning and are useful subsequently for
infrastructure management. As built models may require field measurements and
specialized companies or groups to prepare.
Equipment documentation for operation, maintenance and parts is also assembled as
part of the commissioning process. While this documentation was on paper in the past,
more and more documentation is available digitally. This has the advantage of
providing immediate access to documentation in the field.

124

9.4 Integrating New Facilities into Infrastructure Management
A final commissioning task is to integrate new facilities into the regular practice of
infrastructure management. Fortunately, most new facilities are provided in excellent
condition, so the regular cycle of condition assessment, deterioration modelling and
maintenance/rehabilitation may not be immediately needed.
One aspect of integration is to insure that the actual occupants or users of the new
facilities are familiar with the various idiosyncrasies of the facility. Where are exits and
elevators? Where are emergency supplies and first aid kits? Are offices and rooms set
up in the most effective fashion?
Figure 9.3 shows the recommended transition steps for the commissioning of the
Boston Central Artery/Tunnel (also known as the ‘Big Dig’) (Committee, 2003). This
very large project replaced an elevated roadway with tunnels and added several new
bridges and routes in Boston, Massachusetts. This new facility would be owned and
operated by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA), but the construction itself
was largely contracted out, including a large project management team. As noted in
Figure 9.3, an external review panel urged the MTA to adopt strategic thinking about the
commissioning process needed during the transition to operations. This transition
would also require a public education program to familiarize the traveling public with the
new system.

Commissioning is an ongoing and continuous activity that forms an important
component of the asset management process as described in chapter 2. Properly
125

implemented, commissioning improves building performance, energy efficiency and
sustainability over the life of the asset. The “commissioning”, “retro-commissioning”,
“continuous commissioning” processes include multiple, overlapping activities as
illustrated in Figures 9.4 and 9.5 below.

10.1 Introduction
As previously noted, the opening chapters of this book were focused on the common
methods and processes generally applicable for use in managing any infrastructure
type. This chapter brings that portion of the text to a close and begins to shift our focus
from a “generic” infrastructure application to consider specific infrastructure types.
Before proceeding, it is useful to recall our purpose as well as the processes already
introduced.
Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the purpose of the various infrastructure
management processes the authors have introduced can be synthesized into a
combination of three objectives Risk Management, Resource Allocation and Mission
Performance. In pursuit, of these objectives, we have suggested the following
processes as a means for developing and executing an effective infrastructure
management program: Condition Assessment, Fault Tree Analysis, Deterioration
Modeling, Optimization, and Life Cycle Cost Analysis. Remembering that we are using
the asset management framework (FHWA 99) introduced in Chapter 2 and illustrated
below, we can see that these process, or tools, provide methods for addressing each
element of the system. While not inherently limited, our final process, Benchmarking, is
focused on the performance monitoring and feedback component of the generic asset
management system.

129

Benchmarking is a means of comparing your infrastructure with others. It is useful for
justifying resources, for checking on best practices, and for directing attention to
particular problems. Benchmarking is generally not a topic of infrastructure research,
but can be an important component of infrastructure management.
Benchmarking is distinct from the process of ‘grading’ infrastructure conditions. The
American Society of Civil Engineers (2013) regularly issues a widely read ‘report card’
on US infrastructure, grading a variety of infrastructure types:

130

•
•
•
•

Water and environment: Dams, Drinking Water, Hazardous Waste, Levees,
Solid Waste, Wastewater.
Transportation: Aviation, Bridges, Inland Waterways, Ports, Rail, Road, Transit.
Public Facilities: Parks and Recreation, Schools.
Energy.

The 2013 average ‘grade’ was D+. As noted in Chapter 3, these grades are subjective
(reflecting the opinions of a committee) and based on a variety of factors, including
condition, capacity and resiliency. These grades are intended to inform general
infrastructure investment decision-making. In contrast, benchmarking for infrastructure
management is focused upon improving management practices for specific pieces of
infrastructure.

10.2 Benchmarking Methodology
Virtually any facet of infrastructure management processes can be benchmarked.
Some important categories of benchmarking include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Costs for specific maintenance activities, specific rehabilitations, or general
expenditure.
Energy consumption.
Conditions of assets and amounts of deferred maintenance.
Staff resources and training.
Standards adopted (as discussed further below).
Processes used and documentation developed for management activities.
Safety, environmental practices and emergency procedures.

The goal of such comparisons is to inform decision making and to identify the best
practices available.
Figure 10.2 illustrates a typical benchmarking exercise, in this case for roadway
fatalities by region. Bar chart comparisons within benchmarking groups of figures of
interest such as this are very useful. Refinements of the basic chart in Figure 10.2
might include bars for multiple year histories in each region or a normalizing, unit
comparison such as fatalities per million vehicle miles travelled per year or per thousand
lane-miles of roadway.

131

Figure 10.2 – Benchmarking Example: Roadway Fatalities by DOT Region

Source: FHWA, Public Domain, http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/tsp/fhwasa15089/chap5.cfm.

In developing comparative benchmarks, normalized unit comparisons are generally
more useful than totals. For example, building comparisons might be made on the
basis of square meters of useful space and roadway comparisons on a lane-mile (or
land-kilometer) of roadways.

10.3 Choosing a Benchmarking Cohort
A benchmarking cohort is the group of organizations or infrastructure systems chosen
for comparison. In many cases, the possible members of a comparison group are
limited by the availability and willingness of organizations to provide detailed data. So
data limitations are a primary consideration in choosing a benchmarking comparison.
Another objective that is often used in choosing a benchmarking group is to choose
organizations with similar circumstances. For example, if you are managing the
facilities of a university (like author Don), you may wish to compare with other
universities of similar age, size and research portfolios. Universities with a newer
building stock or without research facilities might have very different infrastructure
parameters than a school such as Carnegie Mellon University.
A very common stratification factor for an infrastructure benchmarking cohort is to have
common climate zones. Infrastructure features such as energy use for heating and
cooling or pavement stress from freeze-thaw cycles are affected by climate, so it is
useful to have benchmark comparisons in similar climate zones. Figure 10.3 illustrates
climate zones in North America, with the zones defined by general characteristics,
precipitation, and temperature. There are a variety of climate zone definition
classifications, as well as a variety of geographic aggregations (from local climates to
large aggregations) available for climate zones.

132

Figure 10.4 illustrates the effects of different climates on operating costs for residential
homes. Hotter climates in the South Atlantic, East South Central and West South
Central region have a higher average use of electricity for air conditioning. With greater
electricity demand, electricity expenses increase.

133

Source: EIA, Public Domain, http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=11831

Another approach for benchmarking is to not seek out comparable benchmark
infrastructure, but to choose benchmarks from organizations thought to have the best
practices and best infrastructure. This benchmarking approach is aspirational, where
an organization is consciously trying to improve.
Finally, benchmarking can be usefully done within the different components of a large
enterprise. For example, a large bank might compare the performance of its various
bank branch buildings with regard to maintenance or energy costs. Figure 10.5
illustrates a benchmark comparison of the frequency of vehicle crashes along roadway
segments. The high crash locations might receive management attention to suggest
alternatives for greater safety as these locations.

134

Infrastructure benchmarking information may be available from public sources (such as
the Bureau of Transportation Statistics), from private companies (generally for a fee)
and from professional organizations (described below).

10.5 Networking and Standards for Best Practices
Professional organizations and societies play important roles in aiding benchmarking
and in developing and spreading best practices and appropriate standards. As noted in
Chapter 1, it is generally beneficial for infrastructure managers to be actively engaged in
one or more relevant professional organizations. These organizations also provide a
means of spreading relevant information, such as job availability. However, these
organizations often are limited to particular types of infrastructure or specific regions or
countries. A partial list of related professional organizations associated with the practice
of infrastructure management in the United States is listed below:
•
•
•

APPA (www.appa.org) Association of Physical Plant Professionals
ASCE (www.asce.org) American Society of Civil Engineers
ASME (www.asme.org) American Society of Mechanical Engineers
135

SAME (www.same.org) Society of American Military Engineers
BOMA (www.boma.org) Building Owners & Managers Association
IFMA (www.ifma.org) International Facilities Management Association
AFE (www.afe.org) Association of Facility Engineers

Codes and standards are developed by agencies and organizations to identify
recommended practices and processes. Numerous codes and standards relevant to
infrastructure management exist, from standards for inspection protocols to
requirements for building insulation. Most standards are adopted voluntarily by an
organization, but codes may be required by regulation, as with municipal building codes.
An example of a voluntary standard is the popular ‘green building standard’ Leadership
in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), developed by the US Green Building
Council (2016). LEED standards exist for new building construction, building
rehabilitation and remodeling and neighborhood development. The standard defines
points that can be earned by projects for items such as high-energy efficiency, excellent
indoor air quality or effective commissioning practices (See Chapter 9). Sufficient points
will lead to different levels of recognition (e.g. gold and platinum awards). Other green
building standards also exist, such as the UK Building Research Establishment’s
Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM). Single attribute building standards also
exist such as the US DOE/EPA Energy Star certification for energy efficient appliances.
In addition to the professional organizations listed above, there are a number of
organizations that are focused on the development of standards. The International
Organization for Standards (ISO, http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html) has developed over
21,000 international standards and has over a hundred national standard setting bodies
as members. The ISO standards range widely, with popular standards for quality
control, environmental, risk and emergency management. The American National
Standards Institute (ANSI, https://www.ansi.org/) is the US member of ISO and also is
active in developing a variety of standards.
Finally, there are also commercial entities that entered the benchmarking field.
Sightlines, LLC (www.sightlines.com) is one such example whose focus is on higher
education.

A road is an identifiable route or path between locations. Nearly all roads are
constructed in some way, typically by smoothing the natural landscape and often by
paving. Roads serve as transportation routes, accommodating bicyclists, horses,
vehicles, and pedestrians. Roads also provide access to property and provide right-ofway to other infrastructure systems such as pipelines or telecommunications cables.
Reflecting the ubiquity and importance of roads, there are many words denoting
roadways, including: avenue, boulevard, court, drive, freeway, highway, parkway, street,
etc.
Roadway construction dates back over 6,000 years. Early roads were paved with
timber, brick and stone. The Roman Empire was noted for an extensive network of
paved roadways, covering roughly 78,000 km in Europe and North Africa 2,000 years
ago. Figure 11.1 shows a modern picture of former Roman road paved with stone and
still in use in Syria.

Roads can be one-way, but most are divided in the center and accommodate two-way
traffic. About a third of worldwide roadway traffic follows the convention of vehicles
traveling on the left side of roadways, while two-thirds follow a right-side convention,
including the United States (Figure 11.2).

Modern pavements are complex systems themselves, with multiple layers and drainage
systems. Figure 11.3 illustrates a flexible (asphalt) pavement used for rural interstates

139

in Idaho. The pavement has a surface layer of asphalt (six inches of plant mix
bituminous pavement), a layer of asphalt treated permeable leveling course (two inches
of ATPLC), gravel, a rock cap, a granular subbase, and a subgrade geotextile. The
pavement is slanted to facilitate rain run-off.

Roadways are used for numerous purposes and by multiple types of vehicles. Table
11.1 shows vehicle miles travelled (in millions) for different types of vehicles and types
of roadways. Limited access interstate roadways have significant amounts of traffic, but
most traffic is carried on other types of roadways. Motorcycles, buses and truck traffic
are significantly smaller than light duty vehicle traffic.

11.2. Duration and Extent of Roadway Infrastructure
Roadways are widespread throughout the world. As an example, Figure 11.4 shows
the mileage of rural and urban highways in the United States from 1950 to 1997. Rural
roadways are much more extensive than urban roadways, even though the bulk of
population resides in urban areas. Unpaved roadways have declined, while the total
mileage of roadways has shown modest increase over the past fifty years. In 1997, US
population was roughly 270 million, representing 68 people for every mile of roadway.
Not included in these highway totals would be a variety of trails, temporary roads for
uses such as logging, or ‘natural’ roadways such as truck pathways on frozen lakes and
rivers.

Figure 11.4 - US Roadway by Area and Paving, 1950-1997

Highway Statistics (Washington, DC: Annual editions), table HM.

More recent trends in US public road mileage, lane miles and overall vehicles miles of
travel are shown in Figure 11.5 for 1980 to 2014. Overall mileage has changed very
little in this period, while lane-miles have increased slightly suggesting that lanes have
been added to existing roadways. In contrast, vehicle miles of travel have increased

141

significantly in this period, suggesting congestion has also been increasing. Note that
the left vertical axis for road mileage and lane-miles starts at three million miles rather
than zero.

The durability of roadways and roadway components can vary considerably. Rights of
way can exist for hundreds of years, especially if a roadway is in regular use.
Pavements and other roadway components are not so longed lived, as discussed in
Chapters 2-4.
Roadway surfaces deteriorate with use and weathering. Deterioration from use is
correlated to the weight of vehicles or, more precisely, the weight of vehicle axles. The
effect of additional tire weight is non-linear, with damage increasing by roughly a power
of four. Roadway traffic is often measured in ‘equivalent single axle loads’ (ESAL)
where the standard single axle load is 18,000 lb (8,200 kg). Figure 11.6 shows
approximate ESAL values for typical vehicles. Buses tend to have higher loads
because they have fewer axles than most trucks.

142

Figure 11.6 - Relative Use Impacts of Different Vehicles

Redrawn and altered by Authors. Measured in equivalent standard axle loads, ESAL.

Pavement design, construction and maintenance are also critical elements affecting the
durability of roadways. Stronger and thicker paving material with a good foundation is
generally expected to last longer than weaker pavements. However, the initial costs of
highly durable pavements may be difficult to justify for low volume roadways. Effective
pavement lifetimes are roughly 10 to 50 years. Typical paving materials include hot mix
asphalt, concrete, and bituminous surface treatment.

11.3. Institutional Arrangements for Roadway Infrastructure Management
Roadways are owned and managed by local governments, national governments, and
private entities. These different groups often have complicated partnership
arrangements in which multiple parties may contribute financing, standards, or other
resources. The different groups may have very different objectives. For example, a
national government may wish to promote inter-state transportation, whereas a local

143

government may be primarily oriented towards providing roadway services for local
businesses and residents.
Users provide the bulk of funding for roadways, with some revenues coming from
general government revenues. Common means of securing revenues include:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Tolls directly on roadway use, usually varying by distance traveled and type of
vehicle. Electronic toll collection using RFID tags is becoming more common.
Vehicle registration fees, usually imposed on an annual basis. These fees may
be applied to roadway construction, management processes (including police) or
be diverted to general government revenues.
Fuel taxes, applied on volumes of fuel purchases. Figure 4 shows the combined
local, state and federal taxes in different states in the United States in 2008.
European fuel taxes tend to be higher than those in North America, whereas fuel
taxes are low or non-existent in some countries.
Vehicle sales taxes, although these taxes may flow to general government
revenues rather than be dedicated to roadways.
Property taxes may be used by local governments to provide local roadways.
Fines such as parking violation fees may be used by local governments.

Figure 11.7 summarizes the sources of revenue for highways in 2010. Note that bond
revenue must be eventually repaid as the bonds mature. Expenditures by type are
shown in Figure 11.8. The capital outlay shown in Figure 11.8 represents rehabilitation
and some lane expansion for existing roadway infrastructure rather than new
construction (as discussed above).

11.4. Some Infrastructure Management Issues for Roadways
Roadways provided an application domain for the early development of asset and
infrastructure management methods and systems. Since roadways are so widespread
and long-lasting, adopting a life cycle viewpoint for design and maintenance decisions
has been widespread but not universal. Bridge and road management systems are
among the best developed software systems to aid infrastructure management.
Examples include the Pontis bridge management system from AASHTO (1997), PAVER
from the USACOE (Shahin, 2016), and HDM from the World Bank (Watanatada, 1987).
Each of these tools involve comprehensive inspection and inventory data gathering as
well as aids for decision making. The tools evolve with changing needs, conditions,
more experience and more research.
Roadway congestion is a continuing cost and difficulty with roadway management
throughout the world. As shown in Figure 11.9, even inter-urban roadways are showing
the effects of congestion.

145

Figure 11.9 - Congestion on Major Truck Routes in the United State 2011

rtrkrts2011.jpg

Figure 11.10 shows the different sources of roadway congestion in the US. The largest
category is bottleneck roadway sections, followed by traffic incidents (such as vehicle
breakdowns or crashes), and bad weather (such as snow or flooding). Work zones for
roadway management activities are also a major source of congestion.

Roadway renovation is a continuing problem in many countries. Projects are expensive
and disrupt normal travel patterns. Novel contracting schemes to speed projects have
been introduced, such as charging for closure of roadways per day. New materials can
also reduce the costs of renovation.
Environmental concerns for roadways are becoming more common. The costs
associated with urban sprawl and climate change reflect the dependence on motor
vehicles and petroleum fuels. While there has been considerable success in reducing
conventional air emissions from motor vehicles (Figure 11.11), greenhouse gas
emissions are a major concern. This concern has resulted in new greenhouse gas
emissions standards as well as promotion of alternative fuels such as battery electric
vehicles powered by renewable power generation.

147

Safety also remains a significant issue for roadway infrastructure. Figure 11.12 shows
fatality rates per capita in different countries of the world. Countries clearly differ in the
risk of vehicle crashes. For roadway management purposes, normalization by vehicle
miles of travel is likely more useful than fatalities per capita as in Figure 11.12.
However, many countries do not report total vehicle miles of travel.

P11.1 (6 pts) How would you design vehicle fees for different types of vehicles to
account for different impacts on pavements? How does your suggested design
compare to existing fees?
P 11.2 (6 pts) The federal government collects diesel and gasoline taxes and puts them
in the Highway Trust Fund. (a) How would you recommend that these funds be
allocated among the different states? (b) Would you allocate any of the funds for public

148

2. P 11.3 (14 pts) Suppose I have a simple network as shown below. I have 300
vehicles going from A to B, and they can either take route A-B or route A-C-B.
The travel time per vehicle on route A-B is 10 + 0.5 qAB min where qAB is the
travel volume on route AB. The travel time per vehicle on route A-C-B is 15 + 0.2
qACB min.
A
B

C

a. Suppose vehicles chose routes such that any route that was used
from A to B had equal travel times. This is called a ‘user
equilibrium’ since no single user has an incentive to change
routes as there is no opportunity to save time by doing so. What
are the travel volumes on the two routes for a user equilibrium?
b. Suppose vehicles are assigned to particular routes to minimize
the total travel time on the network. The resulting pattern is called
a ‘system equilibrium’ since changing a route can only increase
overall system travel times. What are the travel volumes on the
two routes for a system equilibrium?
c. Why do the system and user equilibrium flow volumes differ?
d. Suppose travelers have a value of time of $ 1/6 per minute per
vehicle. For example, if a toll p was imposed on route A-B, the
effective travel time would be 10 + 0.5*qAB + 6*p. Is there a toll
we could impose somewhere on the network that would be a user
equilibrium but have the system equilibrium route volumes? What
is it? What is the resulting revenue?
e. Using the value of time in part d, what is the dollar value of the
difference between user equilibrium and system equilibrium?
f. Suppose we have to do roadway maintenance and shut down link
A-B in the network, diverting all traffic to route A-C-B. What would
be the travel time on this route? Comparing this to the base user
equilibrium (in part a), what is the increase in travel time? Using
the value of time in part d, what is the increase in user cost?

149

g. Roadway renovation contracts often use a system called ‘A+B’ in
which contractors bid’s include a ‘rental fee’ for closing roadways
(that is the +B, whereas A would be the estimated renovation
costs themselves). In the case of our small network, this +B
amount might be represented by your answer to part f. In
practice, the +B amount would be calculated from a typical value
of time, volume on a roadway, and an estimate of the travel time
increase from using alternative routes. What might be the
advantage of the A+B contract system versus a conventional
system (call it A) for infrastructure management? Do you think
renovation costs overall would go up or down with the A+B
system? (Hint: the table below is an example from WSDOT, with
C being the winning, low bidder).

12.1. Introduction
Buildings are constructed to support and protect activity and artifacts. Buildings may
incorporate natural structures, such as the document storage and server farms housed
in rooms within a large, underground limestone mine owned by Iron Mountain in
Pennsylvania. While human buildings are quite prominent, many animals engage in
building activities for nests, hives, etc.
While buildings may be relatively simple structures, most include other systems
providing quite extensive functionality, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Electricity distribution and lighting, typically using alternating current of 110 to
220 volts.
Water distribution and heating for human use.
Waste disposal systems for solid or liquid wastes.
Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Internal transportation systems, including elevators, escalators, and stairways.
Kitchens for food preparation and storage.
Security systems to identify and discourage intruders.
Telecommunications systems for data transfer.
Garages for parking vehicles.
Charging stations for battery electric and plug-in vehicles.

Buildings also have systems for emergencies and security. Fire alarms are often
required by regulation. Signage for evacuation and emergency lighting is common.
First aid supplies are common. Video cameras for security purposes are often installed.

12.2. Duration and Extent of Building Infrastructure
Building statistics often differentiate between commercial, residential and other types of
buildings. Table 12.1 shows the 2003 distribution of commercial buildings in the United
States with regard to size, use, and energy sources. The total inventory includes 4.6
million buildings. Not surprisingly, the numbers of buildings in each size category
declines as size increases. Nearly all commercial vehicles have electricity, and most
have other energy sources.

The numbers of housing units in the United States is shown in Table12.2. The numbers
of residential buildings would be smaller than the number of housing units since there
are multi-unit buildings. Of the 124 million housing units in 2005, 76 million (or 61%) are
single unit houses (Census, 2008). The numbers of housing units has been increasing
over time, reflecting growth in population and a decline in the average size per
household. The fraction of homes owned by residents has been increasing over time to
60% in 2005.

Buildings tend to relatively long-lived types of infrastructure, with averages of 50 to 100
years not uncommon. Many buildings are demolished not due to deterioration, but due
to functional obsolescence: building needs may change and replacing a building may
become advantageous. The US Internal Revenue Service prescribes a depreciation
lifetime of 20 years for farm buildings, 27.5 years for residential rental property and 39
years for nonresidential real estate (Treasury - https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf).
Figure 12.1 shows the reported age of US commercial buildings in 2012, with a median
building age of 32 years. Within any building, components may be replaced more
frequently, such as HVAC or roof replacements.

154

Consumption and Efficiency Statistics, Form EIA-871A of the 2012 Commercial Buildings Energy
Consumption Survey, Public Domain,
https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012/#b11-b14.

12.3. Institutional Arrangements for Building Infrastructure
Buildings may be owned by occupants (or residents) or investors of various kinds. As
shown in Table 12.2, nearly 30% of US housing units are owned by investors and
rented to occupants.
Ownership of buildings commonly changes over the building lifetime. Initially, buildings
may be constructed with the intent of re-sale upon completion of construction, as with
residential developers. Active real estate markets aid in the transfer of ownership
during the lifetime of buildings. Opportunities to gain tax advantages through rapid
depreciation of buildings can motivate relatively frequent building sales. With or without
ownership changes, buildings typically undergo renovations and changes in function
during their lifetime.

155

Lending institutions often make loans using real estate as collateral. In the event of
default on the loans, the lending institution can foreclose and gain possession of the
property. During construction of buildings, the value of buildings is problematic, so
lending institutions typically charge more for construction loans than for mortgage loans
secured by a complete building’s collateral.
Building management can be undertaken by a variety of parties, including owners,
occupants or contractors. Automated aids for building management are typically less
sophisticated than aids for other infrastructure systems, reflecting in part the diverse
ownership of the building infrastructure.

12.4. Some Infrastructure Management Issues for Buildings
Buildings are large consumers of resources and producers of environmental impacts
throughout the world. As a result of these impacts, buildings are receiving increasing
attention to improve function, reduce costs and reduce environmental impact. At the
same time, architectural interests are flourishing to promote ‘aesthetic’ designs. In
addition, there is continuing concern to make buildings better at supporting the
occupants through improved ventilation, noise control and temperature control.
As noted in Chapter 10, ‘Green buildings’ standards are becoming much more
prevalent, with many entities committed to such buildings, including the US General
Services Administration (GSA) (https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/123747). The most
common standard in the US is the Green Building Alliance’s (a private non-profit group)
‘Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design’ (LEED) (USGBC, 2016). It is based
on a point award system for a checklist of possible design and construction activities.
Prerequisites and credits are included in the categories of:

Buildings are certified to different levels of standards based on submitted
documentation and the published point system. Achieving savings in energy inputs
during the building operational phase is of particular interest in the design stages.
Building construction and management improvement are continuing targets for research

13.1 Introduction
Water infrastructure is intended to provide water for a variety of uses, to remove and
treat wastewater, to provide flood risk mitigation, to aid water navigation, to provide
recreational opportunities and to generate electricity or power. Water is essential for
human life, with humans comprised of roughly 50-70% water and drinking (or ingesting)
roughly 2 liters of water per day. Droughts and agricultural salt incursion due to
inadequate water management are often cited as significant causes for the failure of
historic civilizations.
Anthropogenic water withdrawals in the United States are shown in Figure 13.1 in
billions of gallons per day. Irrigation for agriculture and thermoelectric power are the
two largest uses, and both of these uses have corresponding large wastewater runoffs.
With public water supply at 50 billion gallons per day and a population of 300 million,
per capita water use is roughly 50,000/300 = 170 gal/day (640 liters/day) which would
include commercial uses, drinking water, fire fighting, washing, watering, etc. Note that
Figure 13.1 does not include withdrawals for eco-system uses other than agricultural
irrigation.

158

Water withdrawals are different from water consumption or use. Withdrawals for uses
such as thermoelectric power are often returned directly to their source, although at a
higher temperature. Similarly, public water supplies may be used, treated as
wastewater, and returned to a river. Thus, water may be re-used and withdrawn
numerous times.
Access to safe and sustainable drinking water and sanitary resources are major
problems in many areas. The United Nations estimates one billion people lack access
to safe drinking water and 3.5 billion people lacking access to sanitary facilities (WWAP,
2016). A Millennium Goal is to reduce the number of people without access to safe
water in half by 2015.
Water transportation is a significant mode for freight traffic. Figure 13.2 shows inland
waterway freight flows in the United States. The importance of the Mississippi water
system and the Great Lakes are evident.

13.2 Duration and Extent of Water Infrastructure
Statistics and studies of water infrastructure typically make major distinctions among
water supply, wastewater treatment and other water infrastructure. We have combined
all three in this module because particular infrastructure components may serve multiple
purposes. For example, a particular dam may contribute water storage, hydroelectric
power generation, flood control and recreational opportunities. Moreover, different
water infrastructure elements all belong within the common general water cycle. For
example, the output of a wastewater treatment plant will often be the input for a water
supply system downstream. As recycling and reuse become more critical management
strategies, an integrated strategy for water supply, wastewater treatment and other uses
becomes more important.
Unfortunately, summary statistics on the physical extent of the water infrastructure
system are difficult to obtain. After all, the infrastructure has numerous owners and
160

purposes. Some indication of magnitude is indicated in Table 13.1, showing the
revenues and numbers of establishments for water supply, irrigation and sewage
treatment in 2002 obtained from the US Economic Census. Figure 13.3 shows state
and local spending alone on water and wastewater operations to be roughly $ 20B each
in 2001 dollars.

A typical water supply plant involves several process operations to filter and disinfect
‘raw’ water (Figure 13.4). Wastewater treatment has more variations, depending upon
the design level of treatment (Figure 13.5).

Water infrastructure can be very long lived, especially buried pipes, earthen structures
and canals. Table 13.2 shows some estimated lives of water infrastructure
components.

13.3 Institutional Arrangements for Water Infrastructure
Water infrastructure has a variety of government and private owners in nearly all
geographic regions. In the US, city or regional public providers tend to be the most
common arrangement. However, individual metropolitan areas may have multiple
private and public water supply organizations. Municipal wastewater may be managed
by a single entity, but industrial and residential wastewater treatment processes may
also exist. For example, septic tanks may be used in outlying areas. Similarly, the US
Army Corps of Engineers often has primary responsibility for flood damage mitigation,
but numerous other entities may be involved. Navigation aids may be under the control
of the US Coast Guard, but other agencies and private entities may also be involved.
Water quality standards play an important role in influencing infrastructure
management. Most water standards are set at the national level, although standards
exist for the European Union. Different standards may exist for drinking water quality,
recreational water quality, and wastewater treatment outflows.

13.4 Some Infrastructure Management Issues for Water
Four overarching issues should be highlighted for water infrastructure management:
1. Achieving the United Nations’ Millennium goal (described above) of significantly
increasing the availability of clean water throughout the world is a major challenge.
Significant new investments and technology will be needed.
2. Dealing with water shortages in areas where demand exceeds sustainable supplies.
Prioritizing water uses, seeking new sources and expanding re-use are possible
strategies in these areas.
3. Pollution prevention and treatment continue to be major concerns. New pollutants
such as hormones or bio-terrorism provide new challenges.
4. Replacing and improving existing water infrastructure is an issue in many parts of the
world. In the ASCE, the water infrastructure receives a grade of barely passing (D)
(ASCE, 2005) and components are continuing to age.
Financing investments for dealing with these challenges is proving to be difficult.
The US EPA believes that ‘better management practices, efficient water use, full-cost
pricing of water and a watershed approach to protection can all help utilities to operate
more sustainably now and in the long-term (EPA).
•

Better Management of water and wastewater utilities can encompass practices
like asset management and environmental management systems. Consolidation
and public/private partnerships could also offer utilities significant savings.

164

•

•

•

Rates that reflect the Full Cost Pricing of service and rate restructuring can help
utilities capture the actual costs of operating water systems, raise revenues, and
also help to conserve water.
Efficient Water Use is critical, particularly in those parts of the country that are
undergoing water shortages. We need to create market incentives to encourage
more efficient use of water and to protect our sources of water.
Watershed Approaches looks more broadly at water resources in a coordinated
way, which is challenging because we have not traditionally thought of
infrastructure management within the context of water quality protection.

13.5 Some In-Class Exercises and Questions
13.1 (5 pts) Where does your local drinking water come from? How might you identify
its quality relative to clean water standards?
13.2 (10 pts) How much does drinking water cost (in $/liter) is your locality from (a) the
regular tap or (b) the nearest source of retail bottled water.
13.3 (10 pts) Based on the typical local rainfall and water use in your area (e.g. city or
metropolitan area), how much land is required as a watershed?

14.1. Introduction
Telecommunications assist information exchange over a distance by means of
transmitters, a transmission medium and receivers. A variety of transmission media
have been used over time, such as the electric connection used in telegraphy or fiber
optic cables for the Internet. Digital messages are becoming the norm for
telecommunications, with analog signals such as speech translated to digital signals for
transmission. A variety of protocols exists for interpreting messages on different media.
Figure 14.1 shows the growth over a fifteen-year period in various aspects of
telecommunications, focusing on telecom and internet service. The rapid growth in
Internet users and in mobile cellular subscribers is particularly notable.

Figure 14.2 shows the growth over time of a segment of telecommunications, namely
international calls from or to the United States. The amount of traffic has increased
substantially, while the price per minute has declined by an order of magnitude from
2000 to 2014.

Telecommunications are dominated in the United States by private corporations (FCC
1996). Overseas, examples of both private and public providers exist. The ownership
structure for telecommunications infrastructure is complex, with building owners
responsible for their own internal telecommunications and companies often sharing
facilities such as cell towers or neighborhood telephone poles.

14.2. Duration and Extent of Tele-communications Infrastructure
Figure 14.1 showed the rapid growth in the numbers of users of telecommunications
services. In addition, new applications require large amounts of information to be
available rapidly. Figure 14.3 shows some of the demands for applications such as
videoconferencing and entertainment (such as movies on demand).

167

A variety of media are used for telecommunications, including copper wires, fiber optic
cables and wireless transmission. Even power wires can be used for communication.
As an indication of the extent of this infrastructure, Figure 14.4 shows a map of
submarine communications cable as of 2015. In addition to these undersea cables,
roughly 1,000 communications satellites are in orbit around the earth. Internet services
also make use of high speed, high capacity connections such as fiber optic cables and
satellite communications.

The duration and extent of telecommunications infrastructure depends in large part on
how the infrastructure is defined. For example, radio and television transmission towers
are often classified as entertainment rather than telecommunications (and are omitted
from the statistics shown in Figure 14.1). Nevertheless, radio and television now may
be broadcast or provided over the Internet.
Wireless communications, particularly with mobile telephones and personal digital
assistants (pda’s) have also seen notable growth Clarke, 2014). These services
typically connect through cell sites to the regular telecommunications network; with
some 300,000 such cell sites existing in the US in 2012 (See Figure 14.5).

With rapid expansion of use and growing speed and capacity, many parts of the
telecommunications infrastructure have relative short lifetimes. Smart phones and
computers may become functionally obsolete within five years. In contrast, some parts
of the infrastructure may have relatively long lifetimes. Fiber optics
Interdependence between telecommunications and other infrastructure systems is
apparent. For example, telecommunications is needed to manage the electric power
grid, while electricity is needed for telecommunications. Back-up power by means such
as batteries is provided to insure continuing telephone service in case of power
interruptions.
The growth of the internet has increased the complexity of the telecommunications
network and the extent of infrastructure interdependencies. As an illustration, Figure
14.6 shows a partial map of the internet, where nodes are internet protocol (IP)
addresses and the length of links shows the typical delay between two IP addresses.

14.3. Organization of Telecommunications
The bulk of telecommunications is in private ownership, although there are notable
examples of public, non-profit owners and government owners of such infrastructure.
As an example, the Internet has multiple companies providing services. Individual
companies or individuals may maintain local area networks which are connected to
Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In turn, the ISPs connect to backbone service
providers. In effect, the Internet is a network of networks with routers handling packets

171

of information. Protocols and management guidance is provided by organizations such
as the Internet Society.
Regulation of telecommunications is also distributed. In the US, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) was established by the Communications Act of
1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by
radio, television, wire, satellite and cable.
Allocation of the electro-magnetic radio spectrum is a major activity in
telecommunications regulation. In essence, users do not want interference in using
allocated parts of the spectrum. Broadcast radio stations were among the first to have
allocated frequencies which were managed to prevent signal interference. As illustrated
by the 2016 United States frequency allocation chart in Figure 14.7, a very large
number of spectrum users must now be accommodated.

14.4. Some Infrastructure Management Issues for Tele-communications
Tele-communications has similar management problems as other infrastructure
systems, such as power generation or roadways. Numerous structural elements such
as cables, satellites, towers and relay stations must be inspected, maintained and
replaced over time. Communications traffic must be managed, including dealing with
congestion.
Pricing of services and financing necessary infrastructure is a complex issue for telecommunications, particularly as multiple companies may be involved in handling
communications. With the merging of Internet, telephone and entertainment, additional
complications in pricing services (and illegal copying) arise.

15.1. Introduction
‘Electrification’ was selected by the US National Academy of Engineering as the
greatest engineering achievement of the twentieth century (NAE 2008). Electricity is a
primary power source throughout the developed world and many other infrastructure
systems depend upon electricity such as buildings and tele-communications.
Figure 15.1 shows the historical sources of energy consumption in the United States.
Until the twentieth century, wood was a predominant source of energy, with the early
twentieth century seeing the growth in coal use. By 1920, petroleum and national gas
became large sources of energy. Nuclear power began in 1950 with the development
of the atomic industry.

The electricity system was created in the late nineteenth century in the United States for
the primary purpose of lighting. Thomas Edison built and promoted a direct current
network, while George Westinghouse proposed an alternating current network. In 1881,
electricity rates were $ 0.24/kWhr (equivalent to roughly $ 5/kWhr in current dollars),
while modern electricity rates are around $ 0.10/kWhr. Alternating current power grids
have become the norm for reasons of efficiency throughout the world, although local
direct current wiring can be used for light emitting diode (LED) lighting and electronics.
US electricity energy flows for 2007 are shown in Figure 15.2. Coal, natural gas and
nuclear power are the predominant primary energy sources, with renewable energy –
including hydroelectric and wind power- fourth in magnitude. Other sources are
relatively minor. Conversion losses of primary energy sources to electricity are
substantial; moreover, this graphic does not include energy costs of mining, refining and
transporting the primary energy sources to power generation sites. Predominant
electricity uses are classified by EIA as residential, commercial or industrial.

http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/diagram5.html.

World primary energy sources for electricity are similar to the US, with coal, natural gas,
renewable sources and nuclear energy the primary sources (Figure 15.3), although
hydroelectric is larger for the world than for the US itself. However, this distribution can

175

vary substantially from region to region. Some countries have developed extensive and
inexpensive geo-electric and hydro-electric power generation (such as Iceland), while
others emphasize nuclear power generation (such as France.) Qatar is an example of
a country dependent upon natural gas and oil sources.

15.2. Duration and Extent of Electricity Infrastructure
The electricity infrastructure includes generators (power plants), transmission lines,
substations, distribution lines, transformers, control devices and users (Figure 15.5).
There is also supply chain infrastructure required for electricity supply, such as the
mining and transportation of coal to power plants for combustion.

177

Table 15.1 indicates the 2015 numbers and capacity of electricity generators in the US.
The average generator has a rated capacity of 1,167,365MW/20,068 generators = 58
MW. Generation plants themselves can have long lives, with dams and power plant
structures lasting for many decades. Operating equipment such as turbines have much
shorter useful lives and must be replaced regularly in power plants. There is a trend for
increasing reliance on natural gas and other renewable sources of energy and less
reliance on coal due to environmental concerns and the relative prices of different
sources.

Generated power from turbines is normally transmitted as 3-phase alternating current.
As a result, transmission lines usually provide three separate wires, one for each phase.
Transmission lines are quite extensive throughout the United States, although
congestion in some portions of the network is increasing. The US is divided into three
major power grids (Figure 15.6), plus separate grids for Alaska, Hawaii and other
territories. As of 2015, the US bulk electric distribution system consists of more than
360,000 miles of transmission lines including 180,000 miles of high-voltage AC
transmission (Energy, 2015).

From the transmission lines, substations typically step-down the voltage for distribution
to end users (Figure 15.8). Large users such as industries or military bases might have
their own substations.

Distribution to customers involves transformations to reduce voltage (to a common level
of 240 or 120 V) and to provide single phase alternating current. Tele-communications
and electricity service generally share the same telephone poles or underground pipes.
For safety reasons, electricity service occupies the highest portion of the common
telephone pole (Figure 15.9). Local transformers reduce voltage to residential service
levels.

In the early years of electricity use in the US, electric utilities were private, small and
vertically integrated. Over time, all of these characteristics have changed. Public
operating companies emerged, such as the various rural co-operatives and the federal
Tennessee Valley Authority. Economies of scale led to much larger companies, with
Pacific Gas & Electric having over 5 million customers. Finally, organizations can now
specialize in one system aspect, such as power generation, transmission or distribution.
Grid management is provided by regional transmission organization (RTO), such as
PJM in the Pittsburgh region. These organizations provide a market for wholesale
energy purchases, matching demands for power and supply from power generators.
Electricity demand varies over the course of a day (with low points in the middle of the
night) and over the course of a year (with heavy air conditioning electricity demands in
the summer). Electricity supply can also vary as plants come on and off line or as wind
turbines and solar panels respond to weather conditions. As a result, balancing
demand and supply is sometimes difficult, especially since storage of generated power
is expensive. In practice, the RTO must keep extra, rapid response generating capacity

181

available for demand or supply fluctuations. Moreover, the marginal cost of providing
electricity varies over time, including relatively short units of time.
The US regulatory regime for electricity is complicated and changing over time. At the
federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency (FERC) is a key player, with
authority to regulate inter-state electricity sales, wholesale electricity rates and
hydroelectric power. FERC has issued reliability standards for electricity provision. At
the state level, Public Utility Commissions provide varying levels of regulation.

15.4. Some Infrastructure Management Issues for Electricity
The relative costs of different generating modes vary considerably from year-to-year,
day-to-day and even minute-to-minute. Solar and wind power are intermittent and
subject to rapid stoppages. The prices of coal, natural gas and petroleum can vary
considerably. The cost of nuclear power plant construction and uranium fuel also have
great uncertainty. Tax credit provisions for renewable energy also exist, at both the
federal and state levels, and these often change over time. As a result, risk
management and cost minimization are continuing challenges.
A few power interruptions per year are fairly common but can have substantial costs for
users (Figure 15.10). Worker productivity declines and refrigerated items may end up
spoiling. Establishments with urgent needs for continuous power such as hospitals may
invest in back-up generator systems.

Electricity generation is responsible for the largest sector share of greenhouse gas
emissions in the US inventory (See Better Management EPA inventory reports at:
182

http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html) As a result, there
are continuing proposals for regulation or tax on power generation emissions.
Conventional air emissions are already regulated, such as the cap-and-trade regulation
on Sulphur dioxide emissions.
Renewable energy goals and standards are becoming common in the US, motivated by
environmental concerns, energy independence and hopes that investment in new forms
of energy will spur innovation and scale economies that reduce costs. For example,
the renewable portfolio standard enacted by Governor Edward Rendell in 2004 as the
Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Actn213 in Pennsylvania has provisions
requiring that qualified power sources provide 18.5 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity
by 2020. There are two tiers of qualified sources that meet the standard. Tier 1 sources
must make up 8 percent of the portfolio, and include wind, solar, coalmine methane,
small hydropower, geothermal, and biomass. Solar sources must provide 0.5 percent of
generation by 2020. Tier 2 sources make up the remaining 10 percent of the portfolio,
and include waste coal, demand side management, large hydropower, municipal solid
waste, and coal integrated gasification combined cycle (PA213, 2004).
With greater reliance on renewable energy sources, management of the grid becomes
more difficult, with the need for robust back-up power or real time demand
management. Interruptible power contracts already exist, and there is considerable
interest in improved demand side management and real-time pricing. Moreover, the
location of generating sources changes, with concomitant need for new investment in
transmission infrastructure.
A variety of risks also exist for power generation infrastructure. As identified by the
Department of Homeland Security (2015), the major risks to the US infrastructure are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cyber and physical security threats;
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions;
Workforce capability (“aging workforce”) and human errors;
Equipment failure and aging infrastructure;
Evolving environmental, economic, and reliability regulatory requirements; and
Changes in the technical and operational environment, including changes in fuel
supply.

Cyber security and natural disasters have received considerable attention from power
generation infrastructure managers, but much more effort is needed to insure resilient
and secure infrastructure.

16.1 Introduction
In the past few chapters, specific types of infrastructure systems have been discussed.
Infrastructure such as roadways and power generation is widespread and of great social
importance. Organizations exist for the management of this infrastructure. While
managers must consider inter-action and inter-dependency among different types of
infrastructure, the institutional control over different infrastructure systems are typically
independent.
Military bases, campuses, parks and ports are different with regard to institutional
arrangements for infrastructure. Typically, a single organization is responsible for
managing all of the infrastructure for these entities. Moreover, these integrated entities
are generally sufficiently large to warrant employment of a professional staff of
infrastructure managers. As a result, many professional infrastructure managers work
in these integrated entities.
These facilities are also unusual in the types of infrastructure that may be included.
Military bases have specialized infrastructure for their specific missions, such as
ordnance storage facilities. Industrial and university campuses often have specialized
laboratory equipment and facilities. Parks have historic buildings and priceless natural
features. Ports have specialized equipment for handling freight and passengers. Even
golf courses (considered here a form of parks) have special requirements for
landscaping.
Figure 16.1 illustrates a former military base (Fort Jefferson) now located in a national
park (Dry Tortugas) on an island remote from the mainland. This is a complicated
facility, with historic structures for the fort and modern infrastructure to generate power,
water supplies, wastewater and telecommunications. A small port is also on the island
for both boats and seaplanes. As a national park, preservation of the natural ecosystems is a priority. Managing the infrastructure on this island is a complicated job for
the National Park Service!

Figure 16.2 illustrates a university campus, which is another example of a single
institution with multiple infrastructure systems. A university campus can rely on external
infrastructure such as power generation and transportation services. But a multitude of
services are provided on campus, including internal transportation circulation and
parking, water and power distribution, and buildings.

Ports are another example of single institution entities with significant amount of
infrastructure and specialized facilities. Airports, seaports, and inland waterways (as
illustrated in Figure 16.3) are all examples of such entities.

16.2 Extent and Duration of Base, Campus, Park and Port Infrastructure
Bases, campuses, parks and ports are widespread. Figure 16.4 illustrates the numbers
of global airports; the numbers of military bases, campuses, parks and seaports would
be just as large. Figure 16.5 shows the freight tonnage of imports, exports and
domestic cargo at large US seaports in 2006. As can be seen, inland waterway ports
(such as Huntington or Pittsburgh) handle significant amounts of freight. All countries
have bases, campuses, parks and ports, and expansions such as designating new
parks are common.
The duration of these entities is also quite lengthy, with university campuses, parks and
ports lasting longer than institutions such as corporations. Military bases can be long
lasting, although new technology can make some bases obsolete (such as Fort
Jefferson in Figure 16.1). Similarly, seaport facilities must be periodically altered due to
new technology such as freight containerization or larger vessels.

Because these integrated entities are long lasting, infrastructure managers can often
adopt a long planning horizon in making investment decisions. For example, buildings
on university campuses can be rehabilitated regularly but the basic structures and
layouts can last for decades (if not centuries). However, technological developments
often suggest regular change in infrastructure for functions such as computing or
communications.
All types of infrastructure can be found at these integrated entities, including roadways,
buildings, power generation, telecommunication and power generation. In addition
specialized infrastructure such as airport runways and docking facilities exist.
Another feature of these integrated entities is the concept of ‘deferred maintenance.’
Since integrated entities are long lived, recommended maintenance or rehabilitation can
be deferred, resulting in lower infrastructure quality and functionality but corresponding
with budget limitations. Deferred maintenance can and often does increase from year
to year.

16.3 Institutional Arrangements for Bases, Campuses, Parks and Ports
The institutional managers of bases, campuses, parks and ports vary considerably
among different entities and nations. Some typical arrangements are:
•
•

•
•

Military bases are usually controlled by particular branches of the military service,
such as Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marines or Navy.
Campuses may be controlled by government agencies (as with Department of
Energy Laboratories), corporations, or non-profit entities (such as Dartmouth
College shown in Figure 16.2).
Parks may be controlled by national, state or local government agencies.
Privately owned parks also exist, such as the Disney Corporation resorts.
Ports may be controlled by corporations, government agencies or other non-profit
entities.

The concepts associated with infrastructure management outlined in the first ten
chapters of this book, and illustrated in Figure 16.6 below, apply both to independently
controlled and integrated entities. Campus infrastructure managers regularly perform
asset management, inventory, benchmarking, etc.

190

Office of Asset Management, Public Domain, 1999.

However, some regulatory differences exist for integrated entities. For example,
campuses, parks and ports typically have master planning processes in place for longterm infrastructure changes. These plans may include elements such as locations and
rough shapes for future buildings and designations of permanent open space. New
infrastructure is explicitly tied to the entities overall mission (e.g., education and
research for universities), and all new buildings or other investments would then be
designed to conform to the master plan. Cities and states have similar master planning
processes, but these typically recognize the dispersed decision making associated with
dispersed ownership of infrastructure.

191

Transitions in institutional arrangements for these integrated entities can also occur,
although usually over a lengthy period of time. For example, Figure 16.1 showed Fort
Jefferson which was transferred from military control to the National Park Service.
Private community and resort developers may control the entire property initially, but
then control is transferred to individual property buyers and eventually a community
governing organization.

16.4 Issues in Infrastructure Management for Bases, Campuses, Parks and
Ports
Integrated entities have some opportunities for synergies among infrastructure systems
that may be difficult to achieve in more dispersed organizational settings. Adopting a
long term management view can also provide advantages.
One example of such synergies is the use of ‘utilidors,’ or underground tunnels with
multiple utilities for water, power, telecommunications and transport. Figure 16.7
illustrates a large utilidor used at a Disney resort. Figure 16.8 shows a smaller utilidor
used for underground utilities at a university campus. Utilidors simplify maintenance of
underground utilities, avoid overhead utility connections and permits easier upgrades for
systems such as telecommunications. They require an initial capital investment for
construction, but then lower costs over time.

Another example of potential synergies is the adoption of combined heat and power
(CHP) systems. These systems generate electricity but also use the waste heat
productively. An isolated power plant may not have the opportunity to use the waste
heat effectively and often must use significant amounts of water for cooling.

193

Another source of potential advantages for integrated entities is the effect of scale
economies on costs. For example, purchasing large amounts of supplies can result in
cost savings. Similarly, integrated entities may be able to better control demands and
scale infrastructure to the best sizes possible.
Not all integrated entities are compact, however. Parks may have multiple facilities
spread over a large area. In these cases, managers may have to make special efforts
to provide essentials such as power, water and wastewater treatment to isolated
campgrounds or buildings. Figure 16.10 shows a typical isolated service structure of
this type.

Because of the scale of integrated entities, they can have significant environmental and
social impacts. As a result, their infrastructure managers should endeavor to minimize
their impacts. For example, integrated entities have been leaders in adopting green
design standards (Committee, 2013).

processes might differ between an integrated entity (university, military base, etc.) and a
municipality.
