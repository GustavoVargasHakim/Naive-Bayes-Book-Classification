PREFACE
Beyond Race: Cultural Influences on Human Social Life was written for introductory courses on
cultural sociology. The book was designed for faculty and students searching for an open
educational resource (OER) that provides sociological terms, concepts, and theories in the study
of culture. To adapt to the educational needs of individuals using this book, the instructor or
learner must understand the underlying content and instructional approach may require
additional resources and/or other methods to make the learning experience her or his own.
The book is supported by discussion of relevant theory and research in cultural sociology.
Beyond Race: Cultural Influences on Human Social Life has stressed learner-centered teaching
with the instructor taking on the role of a facilitator of learning. As such, it is expected the
instructor will serve as the mediator between the content of this book and learners’
understanding of material on multiple and higher levels. This book does not offer a set of rules
in teaching cultural sociology, but rather suggests content and applications to consider and
modify as needed by the ever-changing dynamics of instructors and learners.
The first edition of this book was prepared in collaboration with my colleagues at West Hills
College Lemoore and California State University, Fresno. My thanks go to Neomi Daniels, my
copyeditor, Katie Conklin and Greg Kennedy, who made helpful content suggestions, the West
Hills Community College District Office for their support in OER, and the West Hills College

INTRODUCTION
Culture is an expression of our lives. It molds our identity and connection to the social world.
Whether it is our values, beliefs, norms, language, or everyday artifacts each element of culture
reflects who we are and influences our position in society.
If you think about how we live, communicate, think and act, these parts of our existence
develop from the values, beliefs, and norms we learn from others, the language and symbols
we understand, and the artifacts or materials we use. Culture is embedded into everyday life
and is the attribute in which others view and understand us.
LINK BETWEEN CULTURE AND SOCIETY
Culture is both expressive and social. Neither culture nor society exist in the real world rather it
is the thoughts and behaviors of people that constructs a society, its culture, and meanings
(Griswold 2013). People build the world we live in including the cultural attributes we choose to
obtain, exhibit, and follow. Societies communicate and teach culture as part of the human
experience.
Historically, culture referred to characteristics
and qualities of the fine arts, performing arts,
and literature connecting culture to social
status. This perspective emphasized a
subculture shared by the social elite or upper
class and has been historically characterized as
civilized culture. This perspective within the
humanities studied the “ideal type” or “high
culture” of affluent social groups depicting
whom was “cultured” or rather was wealthy
and educated in society lending itself to a
ranking of cultures in its study.

In the 19th century, anthropologist Edward B. Tyler (1871) introduced culture as a complex
social structure encompassing “. . . knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and other
capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.” This definition focused on
culture as a social attribute of humanity. Social scientists adopted this perspective expanding
the study of culture beyond the ethnocentric elitism of “high culture.” With emphasis on
human social life as a reflection of culture, social scientists sought to understand not only how
culture reflects society but also how society reflects culture. These new insights inspired social
scientists to examine the practices of people lending itself to a sociological perspective on
culture.
DEFINING CULTURE
Culture is universal. Every society has culture. Culture touches every “aspect of who and what
we are” and becomes a lens of how we see and evaluate the world around us (Henslin
2011:36). Culture molds human nature and people learn to express nature in cultural ways. The
sociological perspective acknowledges that all people are cultured.
Each generation transmits culture to the next providing us a roadmap and instruction on how to
live our lives. Cultural transmission occurs through the learning and expression of traditions and
customs. Learning your own group’s culture is enculturation. Adults are agents of enculturation
responsible for passing on culture to each generation.
Through learning, people develop individual cultural characteristics that are part of a social
pattern and integrated set of traits expressing a group’s core values (Kottak and Kozitis 2003).
Thus, cultures are integrated and patterned systems serving a variety of social functions within
groups. Enculturation gives members of a group a process to think symbolically, use language
and tools, share common experiences and knowledge, and learn by observation, experience, as
well as unconsciously from each other (Kottak and Kozitis 2003). The commonalities we share
through culture establish familiarity and comfort among members of our own group.
Non-Material vs. Material Culture
Culture is either non-material or material. Non-material culture includes psychological and
spiritual elements influencing the way individuals think and act. Material culture refers to
physical artifacts people use and consume.
Immaterial aspects of culture reflect social values, beliefs, norms, expressive symbols, and
practices. Though these cultural elements are intangible, they often take on a physical form in
our minds. Non-material culture becomes real in our perceptions and we begin to view them as
objects as in the belief of God or other deity. Though we cannot physically see, hear, or touch a
God belief makes them real and imaginable to us.
Values or ideals define what is desirable in life and guides our preferences and choices.
Changes in core values may seem threatening to some individuals or societies as “a threat to a

way of life” (Henslin 2011:53). A strong bind to core values can also blind individuals to reality
or objectivity reinforcing fallacies and stereotypes. Throughout history, there have always been
differences between what people value (their ideal or public culture) and how they actually live
their lives (their real or personal culture).
Beliefs sometimes mirror values. One’s belief system may align or determine their values
influencing thoughts and actions. Beliefs are not always spiritual or supernatural. For example,
the belief in love or feelings of affection are internal emotions or physical reactions that exhibit
physiological changes in human chemistry. Some beliefs are true representations of
metaphysical or abstract thinking which transcend the laws of nature such as faith or
superstitions.
CULTURAL INVENTORY

What is your personal cultural inventory? Describe your values and beliefs, the social norms in which you
conform, the expressive symbols (including language) you understand and use regularly, your daily practices,
and the artifacts you use frequently and those you treasure.
How did you learn culture? Explain the socializing agents responsible for teaching you the traditions, customs,
and rituals you live by and follow.
What impact does culture have on your identity? Discuss how your culture influences your self-image,
views, and role in society.
How does culture influence your thinking and behavior towards others? Explain how your culture impacts the
image or understanding you have about others including assumptions, stereotypes, and prejudices.

Norms or rules develop out of a group’s values and beliefs. When people defy the rules, they
receive social reactions resulting in a sanction. Sanctions are a form of social control (Griffiths,
Keirns, Strayer, Cody-Rydzewsk, Scaramuzzo, Sadler, Vyain, Byer, and Jones 2015). When
people follow the rules, they receive a positive sanction or reward, and when they break the
rules, they receive a negative one or punishment that may include social isolation.
Symbols help people understand the world (Griffiths et al. 2015). Symbols include gestures,
signs, signals, objects, and words. Language is the symbolic system people use to communicate
both verbally and in writing (Griffiths et al. 2015). Language constantly evolves and provides the
basis for sharing cultural experiences and ideas.
The Sapir-Worf Hypothesis suggests people experience the world through symbolic language
that derives from culture itself (Griffiths et al. 2015). If you see, hear, or think of a word, it
creates a mental image in your head helping you understand and interpret meaning. If you are
not familiar with a word or its language, you are unable to comprehend meaning creating a
cultural gap or boundary between you and the cultural world around you. Language makes
symbolic thought possible.
Practices or the behaviors we carry out develop from or in response to our thoughts. We fulfill
rituals, traditions, or customs based on our values, beliefs, norms, and expressive symbols.

Culture dictates and influences how people live their lives. Cultural practices become habitual
from frequent repetition (Henslin 2011). Habitualization leads to institutionalization by
consensus of a social group. This results in cultural patterns and systems becoming logical and
the viewed as the norm.
Material culture is inherently unnatural, such as buildings, machines, electronic devices,
clothing, hairstyles, etc. (Henslin 2011). Dialogue about culture often ignores its close tie to
material realities in society. The cultural explanations we receive from family, friends, school,
work, and media justify cultural realities and utilities of the artifacts we use and consume.
Human behavior is purposeful and material culture in our lives derives from the interests of our
socializing agents in our environment.
CULTURAL SOCIOLOGY
There is division among sociologists who study culture. Those who study the sociology of
culture have limitations on the categorizations of cultural topics and objects restricting the view
of culture as a social product or consequence. The theoretical works of Emile Durkheim, Karl
Marx, and Max Weber and the field of anthropology, shaped the sociology of culture. Durkheim
found culture and society are interrelated. He explained social structures or institutions serve a
functions society. As a collective group, society’s culture including its social, political and
economic values are essentially part of and reflected in all structures or institutions (Durkheim
1965). Marx believed social power influences culture. He suggested cultural products depend
on economics and people who have power are able to produce and distribute culture (Marx
1977). Weber in alignment with the traditional humanities viewpoint emphasized the ability of
culture to influence human behavior. His perspective argued some cultures and cultural works
are ideal types that could be lost if they were not preserved or archived (Weber 1946). Until the
late twentieth century, anthropologists emphasized the importance of art and culture to
educate, instill morality, critique society to inspire change (Best 2007). Initial thoughts on
culture focused on how culture makes a person. These works accentuated the idea that certain
cultural elements (i.e., elite or high culture) make a person cultured.
In contrast, the study of cultural sociology suggests social phenomena is inherently cultural
(Alexander 2003). Cultural sociology investigates culture as an explanation of social
phenomena. During the cultural turn movement of the 1970s, cultural sociology emerged as a
field of study among anthropologists and social scientists evaluating the role of culture in
society. Academics expanded their research to the social process in which people communicate
meaning, understand the world, construct identity, and express values and beliefs (Best 2007).
This new approach incorporates analyzing culture using data from interviews, discussions, and
observations of people to understand the social, historical structures and ideological forces that
produce and confine culture.
Cultural sociology examines the social meanings and expressions associated with culture.
Cultural sociologists study representations of culture including elitist definitions and
understanding such as art, literature, and classical music, but also investigate the broad range

of culture in everyday social life (Back, Bennett, Edles, Gibson, Inglis, Jacobs, and Woodward
2012). Noting the significance of culture in human social life, sociologists empirically study
culture, the impact of culture on social order, the link between culture and society, and the
persistence and durability of culture over time (Griswold 2013). Cultural sociology incorporates
an interdisciplinary approach drawing on different disciplines because of the broad scope and
social influences culture has on people. Culture is inseparable from the acts and influence of
cultural practices embedded within social categories (i.e., gender, ethnicity, and social class)
and social institutions (i.e., family, school, and work) that construct identities and lifestyle
practices of individuals (Giddens 1991; Chaney 1996). In the effort to understand the
relationship between culture and society, sociologists study cultural practices, institutions, and
systems including the forms of power exhibited among social groups related to age, body and
mind, ethnicity, gender, geography, race, religion and belief systems, sex, sexuality, and social
class.

Ethnographers and Native Anthropologists
In the study of cultural sociology, many practitioners examine both quantitative and qualitative
data to develop an understanding of cultural experiences. Quantitative or numeric data
provides a framework for understanding observable patterns or trends while qualitative or
categorical data presents the reasoning behind thoughts and actions associated with patterns
or trends.
The collection of qualitative data incorporates scientific methodological approaches including
participant observation (observing people as a member of the group), interviews (face-to-face
meetings), focus groups (group discussions), or images (pictures or video). Each method focuses
on collecting specific types of information to develop a deep understanding about a particular
culture and the experiences associated with being a member of that culture.

Ethnographers study people and cultures by
using qualitative methods. Ethnography or
ethnographic research is the firsthand, fieldbased study of a particular culture by spending at
least one year living with people and learning
their customs and practices (Kottak and Kozaitis
2012). In the field, ethnographers are participant
observers and a participant of the group or
society of study. Participant observers face
challenges in remaining objective, non-bias, and
ensuring their participation does not lead or
influence others of the group in a specific

direction (Kennedy, Norwood, and Jendian 2017).

This research approach expects ethnographers to
eliminate the risk of contaminating data with
interference or bias interpretations as much as humanly possible.
Some researchers choose to study their own culture. These practitioners refer to themselves as
native anthropologists. Many native anthropologists have experience studying other cultures
prior to researching their own (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). The practice of learning how to study
other cultures gives practitioners the skills and knowledge they need to study their own culture
more objectively. In addition, by studying other cultures then one’s own, native anthropologists
are able to compare and analyze similarities and differences in cultural perceptions and
practices.
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON CULTURE
The social structure plays an integral role in the social location (i.e., place or position) people
occupy in society. Your social location is a result of cultural values and norms from the timeperiod and place in which you live. Culture effects personal and social development including
the way people will think or behave. Cultural characteristics pertaining to age, gender, race,
education, income and other social factors influence the location people occupy at any given
time.
Furthermore, social location influences how people perceive and understand the world in
which we live. People have a difficult time being objective in all contexts because of their social
location within cultural controls and standards derived from values and norms. Objective
conditions exist without bias because they are measureable and quantifiable (Carl 2013).
Subjective concerns rely on judgments rather than external facts. Personal feelings and
opinions from a person’s social location drive subjective concerns. The sociological imagination
is a tool to help people step outside subjective or personal biography, and look at objective
facts and the historical background of a situation, issue, society, or person (Carl 2013).

PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
The time period we live (history) and our personal life experiences (biography) influence our perspectives and
understanding about others and the world. Our history and biography guide our perceptions of reality
reinforcing our personal bias and subjectivity. Relying on subjective viewpoints and perspectives leads to
diffusion of misinformation and fake news that can be detrimental to our physical and socio-cultural
environment and negatively impact our interactions with others. We must seek out facts and develop
knowledge to enhance our objective eye. By using valid, reliable, proven facts, data, and information, we
establish credibility and make better decisions for the world and ourselves.

Consider a socio-cultural issue you are passionate about and want to change or improve.
What is your position on the issue? What ideological or value-laden reasons or beliefs support your
position? What facts or empirical data support your position?
What portion of your viewpoint or perspective on the issue relies on personal values, opinions, or beliefs in
comparison to facts?
Why is it important to identity and use empirical data or facts in our lives rather than relying on ideological
reasoning and false or fake information?

According to C. Wright Mills (1959), the sociological imagination requires individuals to “think
themselves away” in examining personal and social influences on people’s life choices and
outcomes. Large-scale or macrosociological influences help create understanding about the
effect of the social structure and history on people’s lives. Whereas, small-scale or
microsociological influences focus on interpreting personal viewpoints from an individual’s
biography. Using only a microsociological perspective leads to an unclear understanding of the
world from bias perceptions and assumptions about people, social groups, and society (Carl
2013).
Sociologists use theories to study the people. “The
theoretical paradigms provide different lenses into
the social constructions of life and the relationships of
people” (Kennedy, Norwood, and Jendian 2017:22).
The theoretical paradigms in sociology help us
examine and understand cultural reflections including
the social structure and social value culture creates
and sustains to fulfill human needs as mediated by
society itself. Each paradigm provides an objective
framework of analysis and evaluation for
understanding the social structure including the
construction of the cultural values and norms and
their influence on thinking and behavior.

The Theoretical Paradigms
Macrosociology studies large-scale social arrangements or constructs in the social world. The
macro perspective examines how groups, organizations, networks, processes, and systems
influences thoughts and actions of individuals and groups (Kennedy et al. 2017). Functionalism,
Conflict Theory, Feminism, and Environmental Theory are macrosociological perspectives.
Microsociology studies the social interactions of individuals and groups. The micro perspective
observes how thinking and behavior influences the social world such as groups, organizations,
networks, processes, and systems (Kennedy et al. 2017). Symbolic Interactionism and Exchange
Theory are microsociological perspectives.
Functionalism is a macrosociological perspective examining the purpose or contributions of
interrelated parts within the social structure. Functionalists examine how parts of society
contribute to the whole. Everything in society has a purpose or function. Even a negative
contribution helps society discern its function. For example, driving under the influence of
alcohol or drugs inspired society to define the behavior as undesirable, develop laws, and
consequences for people committing such an act. A manifest function in society results in
expected outcomes (i.e., using a pencil to develop written communication). Whereas, a latent
function has an unexpected result (i.e., using a pencil to stab someone). When a function
creates unexpected results that cause hardships, problems, or negative consequences the
result is a latent dysfunction.
Conflict Theory is a macrosociological perspective exploring the fight among social groups over
resources in society. Groups compete for status, power, control, money, territory, and other
resources for economic or other social gain. Conflict Theory explores the struggle between
those in power and those who are not in power within the context of the struggle. Cultural wars
are common in society, whether controversy over a deity and way of life or ownership and
rights over Holy Land.
Symbolic Interactionism is a microsociological perspective observing the influence of
interactions on thinking and behavior. Interactionists consider how people interpret meaning
and symbols to understand and navigate the social world. Individuals create social reality
through verbal and non-verbal interactions. These interactions form thoughts and behaviors in
response to others influencing motivation and decision-making. Hearing or reading a word in a
language one understands develop a mental image and comprehension about information
shared or communicated (i.e., the English word “bread” is most commonly visualized as a slice
or loaf and considered a food item).
There are three modern approaches to sociological theory (Carl 2013). Feminism, a
macrosociological perspective, studies the experiences of women and minorities in the social
world including the outcomes of inequality and oppression for these groups. One major focus
of the feminist theoretical approach is to understand how age, ethnicity, race, sexuality, and
social class interact with gender to determine outcomes for people (Carl 2013). Exchange

Theory examines decision-making of individuals in society. This microsociological perspective
focuses on understanding how people consider a cost versus benefit analysis accentuating their
self-interest to make decisions. Environmental Theory explores how people adjust to ecological
(environmental and social) changes over time (Carl 2013). The focal point of this
macrosociological perspective is to figure out how people adapt or evolve over time and share
the same ecological space.
Applying Theories
Functionalists view how people work together to create society as a whole. From this
perspective, societies needs culture to exist (Griffiths, Keirns, Strayer, Cody-Rydzewsk,
Scaramuzzo, Sadler, Vyain, Byer, and Jones 2015). For example, cultural norms or rules function
to support the social structure of society, and cultural values guide people in their thoughts and
actions. Consider how education is an important concept in the United States because it is
valued. The culture of education including the norms surrounding registration, attendance,
grades, graduation, and material culture (i.e., classrooms, textbooks, libraries) all support the
emphasis placed on the value of education in the United States. Just as members of a society
work together to fulfill the needs or society, culture exists to meet the basic needs of its
members.
Conflict theorists understand the social structure as inherently unequal resulting from the
differences in power based on age, class, education, gender, income, race, sexuality, and other
social factors. For a conflict theorist, culture reinforces issues of "privilege” groups and their
status in social categories (Griffiths et al. 2015). Inequalities exist in every cultural system.
Therefore, cultural norms benefit people with status and power while harming others and at
the expense of others. For example, although cultural diversity is valued in the United States,
some people and states prohibit interracial marriages, same-sex marriages, and polygamy
(Griffiths et al. 2015).
Symbolic interactionists see culture as created and maintained by the interactions and
interpretations of each other’s actions. These theorists conceptualize human interactions as a
continuous process of deriving meaning from the physical and social environment. “Every
object and action has a symbolic meaning, and language serves as a means for people to
represent and communicate their interpretations of these meanings to others” (Griffiths et al.
2015:72). Interactionists evaluate how culture depends on the interpretation of meaning and
how individuals interact when exchanging comprehension and meaning. For instance,
derogatory terms such as the “N” word might be acceptable among people of the same cultural
group but viewed as offensive and antagonistic when used by someone outside of the group.
Feminists explore the cultural experiences of women and minorities. For example, women in
Lebanon do not have the right to dissolve a marriage without her husband’s consent even in
cases of spousal abuse (Human Rights Watch 2015). Feminism explicitly examines oppression
structures within culture systems and the inequity some groups confront in relation to their
age, gender, race, social class, sexuality, or other social category.

Exchange theorists observe how culture influences decision-making. Cultural values and beliefs
often influence people’s choices about premarital sex and cohabitation before marriage. If you
evaluate your decisions on a daily basis, you might see elements of culture behind the
motivation driving your choices.
Environmental theorists assess how culture, as part of the social and physical environment,
adapts and changes over time. If you contemplate any rule of law, you can see how culture has
altered because of shifts in social ideas or ecological fluctuations. Consider the anti-tobacco
laws in the United States making it illegal to smoke in public areas as an example of social shifts
towards health and wellness or water meters to control and regulate residential water usage
and waste as an example of ecological drought and prolonged water shortages in the United
States.
THEORETICAL APPLICATION
Popular culture reflects prominent values, beliefs, norms, symbolic expressions, and practices while re-enforcing
American ideologies and myths. Develop a written response exploring the depiction of contemporary American
culture in an episode of a contemporary television show drama (i.e., NCIS, Game of Thrones, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
Breaking Bad, etc.)
1.
2.
3.
4.

Describe American cultural ideologies or principles portrayed in the show (i.e., unity, diversity, patriotism,
etc.).
Explain which myths or untruths are evident in the film that express fundamental cultural values or norms.
Discuss how the show mirrors social and cultural trends.
Analyze the culture portrayed in the television show using each of the theoretical paradigms: Functionalism,
Conflict Theory, Interactionism, Feminism, Exchange Theory, and Environmental Theory.

SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF CULTURE
How does culture affect your thinking and behavior? How are you able to communicate the
influence of culture on your life to others? How do you justify your culture as true, real, or
tangible?
Because culture is a socially meaningful
expression that can be articulated and
shared it often takes a physical form in our
minds. A spiritual or philosophical
expression that is not physical in nature
becomes tangible in our minds and is
equivalent to an “object” (Griswold 2013).
The cultural expression is so real that
people perceive it as something achievable
or concrete (even if only in psychological
form). The mental picture is the object and
the meaning associated with the object is

the expression when we are speaking

about non-material culture. When people
discuss love, they imagine it in their minds and feel it in their hearts even though no one can
truly touch love in a physical form. We associate love to a variety of mental and physical
interactions, but love itself is not tangible or concrete. Whereas, material culture is associated
with physical artifacts projecting a clear understanding of its nature because it is visible,
audible, and can be touched. We buy and give gifts to express our love. The material artifact we
give to someone is a tangible expression of love. In this example, the expression of nonmaterial culture is evident in material culture (love = gift) and material culture represents nonmaterial culture (gift = love) making both forms cultural “objects.”
Cultural objects become representations of many things and can have many meanings based
on the history and biography of an individual, group, or society. Think about the mantra,
“Follow your dreams.” The expression is often used in the United States when discussing

educational and career motivation and planning. For many U.S. citizens, this statement creates
an open space for academic or professional choices and opportunities. However, the “object” is
limited to the culture of the individual. In other words, your “dream” is limited to the cultural
environment and social location you occupy. For example, if you are in a family where men and
women fill different roles in work and family then your educational and career choices or
pathways are limited to the options within the context of your culture (i.e., values, beliefs, and
norms). Afghan culture does not value or permit the education of girls. In Afghanistan, one third
of girls marry before 18, and once married they are compelled to drop out of school (Human
Rights Watch 2017). The educational and career choices of Afghan girls is limited to the culture
of their country and the social location of their gender. This means to “follow your dreams” in
Afghanistan is confined to what a dream as an object can represent based on the gender of the
person.
How does culture become an “object” or solidified, socially accepted, and followed? According
to Griswold (2013) people create, articulate, and communicate culture. However, this does not
mean every cultural idea or creation is accepted by society. Though people create culture,
other people must receive or accept culture to become tangible, real, or recognized as an
object including artifacts. The creation of cultural ideas and concepts must have an audience to
receive it and articulate its meaning in order for culture to be established and accepted. The
context of the social world including time, place, conditions, and social forces influence
whether an audience accepts or rejects a cultural object. Consider the many social media
applications available to us today. With so many social media outlets and options available,
which are the most recognized and used? Which social media apps have become part of our
everyday lives, and which do we expect people to use and be familiar with as a norm?
When Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams created Twitter, they introduced a
cultural idea to society. As word spread about the application and people began to use it,
communication about its relevance and usefulness grew. As the network of users grew more
and more people were intrigued to discover the application and make it part of their lives
leading to Twitter becoming a cultural object. Not only did Twitter need to demonstrate
relevance to reach potential users, but it also had to be timely and applicable in context or to
the needs of modern society.
Since the development of the Internet, many people and organizations have developed a
variety of social media applications, but only a few apps have transcended time to become part
of our culture because they were able to develop an audience or significant number of cultural
receivers to legitimize them. Other than Twitter, what social media applications have become
part of our culture? Research and describe the demographics of the audience or receivers for
each application identified and discuss the context or environment that made the app relevant
for its time and users.

DISSECTING CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION
Consider the social issue of cyberbullying.

Describe the social context or environment that has led to the development and growth of this issue.
What cultural elements do we associate with cyberbullying? What are the values, beliefs, norms,
symbolic expressions, and artifacts or materials used by perpetrators to create a culture of
cyberbullying?
How do victims, observers, and the public receive this culture? What meanings do people associate by
the expressions used by perpetrators that make the issue "real"?
Reflecting on your responses to Questions 1-3, explain how social context, cultural creation, and
cultural acceptance work to make the issue of cyberbullying a cultural object.

COLLECTIVE CULTURE
Among humans, there are universal cultural patterns or elements across groups and societies.
Cultural universals are common to all humans throughout the globe. Some cultural universals
include cooking, dancing, ethics, greetings, personal names, and taboos to name a few. Can you
identify at least five other cultural universals shared by all humans?
In thinking about cultural universals, you may have noted the variations or differences in the
practice of these cultural patterns or elements. Even though humans share several cultural
universals, the practice of culture expresses itself in a variety of ways across different social
groups and institutions. When different groups identify shared culture, we often are speaking
from generalizations or general characteristics and principles shared by humans. The
description of cultural universals speak to the generalization of culture such as in the practice of
marriage. Different social groups share the institution of marriage but the process, ceremony,
and legal commitments are different depending on the culture of the group or society.
Cultural generalities help us understand the similarities and connections all humans have in the
way we understand and live even though we may have particular ways of applying them. Some
cultural characteristics are unique to a single place, culture, group, or society. These
particularities may develop or adapt from social and physical responses to time, geography,
ecological changes, group member traits, and composition including power structures or other
phenomena.
Cultural and Social Bonds
By living together in society, people “learn specific ways of looking at life” (Henslin 2011:104).
Through daily interactions, people construct reality. The construction of reality provides a
forum for interpreting experiences in life expressed through culture.
Emile Durkheim ([1893] 1933) believed social bonds hold people together. When people live in
small, integrated communities that share common values and beliefs, they develop a shared or
collective consciousness. Durkheim referred to this type of social integration as mechanical

BEYOND RACE: CULTURAL INFLUENCES ON HUMAN SOCIAL LIFE

16

solidarity meaning members of the community are all working parts of the group or work in
unity creating a sense of togetherness forming a collective identity. In this example, members
of the community think and act alike because they have a shared culture and shared
experiences from living in remote, close-knit areas.
As society evolves and communities grow,
people become more specialized in the
work they do. This specialization leads
individuals to work independently in order
to contribute to a segment or part of a
larger society (Henslin 2011). Durkheim
referred to this type of social unity as
organic solidarity meaning each member
of the community has a specific task or
place in the group in which they
contribute to the overall function of the

community that is spatial and culturally
diverse. In this example, community members do not necessarily think or act alike but
participate by fulfilling their role or tasks as part of the larger group. If members fulfill their
parts, then everyone is contributing and exchanging labor or production for the community to
function as a whole.
Both mechanical and organic solidarity explain how people cooperate to create and sustain
social bonds relative to group size and membership. Each form of solidarity develops its own
culture to hold society together and function. However, when society transitions from
mechanical to organic solidarity, there is chaos or normlessness. Durkheim referred to this
transition as social anomie meaning “without law” resulting from a lack of a firm collective
consciousness. As people transition from social dependence (mechanical solidarity) to
interdependence (organic solidarity), they become isolated and alienated from one another
until a redeveloped set of shared norms arise. We see examples of this transition when there
are changes in social institutions such as governments, industry, and religion. Transitions to
democracy across the continent of Africa have shown countries contending with poverty,
illiteracy, militarization, underdevelopment, and monopolization of power, all forms of anomie,
as they move from social dependence to interdependence (The National Academic Press 1992).
People develop an understanding about their culture specifically their role and place in society
through social interactions. Charles Horton Cooley ([1902] 1964) suggested people develop self
and identity through interpersonal interactions such as perceptions, expectations, and
judgement of others. Cooley referred to this practice as the looking glass self. We imagine how
others observe us and we develop ourselves in response to their observations. The concept
develops over three phases of interactions. First, we imagine another’s response to our
behavior or appearance, then we envision their judgment, and lastly we have an emotional
response to their judgement influencing our self-image or identity (Griswold 2013).

Interpersonal interactions play a significant role in helping us create social bonds and
understand our place in society.
Group and Organizational Culture
The term group refers to any collection of at least two people who interact frequently and
share identity traits aligned with the group (Griffiths et al. 2015). Groups play different roles in
our lives. Primary groups are usually small groups characterized by face-to-face interaction,
intimacy, and a strong sense of commitment. Primary groups remain “inside” us throughout our
lifetime (Henslin 2011). Secondary groups are large and impersonal groups that form from
sharing a common interest. Different types of groups influence our interactions, identity, and
social status. George Herbert Mead (1934) called individuals effecting a person’s life as
significant others, and he conceptualized “generalized others” as the organized and generalized
attitude of a social group.
Different types of groups influence our
interactions, identity, and social status. An ingroup is a group toward which one feels
particular loyalty and respect. The traits of ingroups are virtues, whereas traits of outgroups are vices (Henslin 2011). An out-group
is a group toward which one feels antagonism
and contempt. Consider fans at a sporting
event, people cheering on our supporting the
same team will develop an in-group
admiration and acceptance while viewing
fans of the opposing team as members of
their out-group.

Reference groups are also influential groups in someone’s life. A reference group provides a
standard for judging one’s own attitudes or behaviors within a social setting or context (Henslin
2011). People use reference groups as a method for self-evaluation and social location. People
commonly use reference groups in the workplace by watching and emulating the interactions
and practices of others so they fit in and garner acceptance by the group.
Group dynamics focus on how groups influence individuals and how individuals affect groups.
The social dynamics between individuals plays a significant role in forming group solidarity.
Social unity reinforces a collective identity and shared thinking among group members thereby
constructing a common culture (Griswold 2013). Commonalities of group membership are
important for mobilizing individual members. When people attempt to create social change or
establish a social movement group, solidarity helps facilitate motivation of individuals and
framing of their actions. The sense of belonging and trust among the group makes it easier for
members to align and recognize the problem, accept a possible solution, take certain actions
that are congruent and complementary to the collective identity of the group (Griswold 2013).

People accept the group’s approach based on solidarity and cohesiveness that overall amplifies
personal mobilization and commitment to the group and its goals.

What lessons can you learn about collective identity from the stories presented?
How does group culture make it possible to construct a social movement? Explain how microsociological
acts (social interactions) lead to macrosociological changes (systems, organizations, and processes) in
society.
What impact does intrinsic or internal motivation and framing of the issue have on organizing a social
movement?

An organization refers to a group of people with a collective goal or purpose linked to
bureaucratic tendencies including a hierarchy of authority, clear division of labor, explicit rules,
and impersonal (Giddens, Duneier, Applebaum, and Carr 2013). Organizations function within
existing cultures and produce their own. Formal organizations fall into three categories
including normative, coercive, and utilitarian (Etzioni 1975). People join normative or voluntary
organizations based on shared interests (e.g., club or cause). Coercive organizations are groups
that people are coerced or forced to join (e.g., addiction rehabilitation program or jail). People
join utilitarian organizations to obtain a specific material reward (e.g., private school or
college).
When we work or live in organizations, there are multiple levels of interaction that effect social
unity and operations. On an individual level, people must learn and assimilate into the culture
of the organization. All organizations face the problem of motivating its members to work
together to achieve common goals (Griswold 2013). Generally, in organizations small group
subcultures develop with their own meaning and practices to help facilitate and safeguard
members within the organizational structure. Group members will exercise force (peer pressure
and incentives), actively socialize (guide feelings and actions with normative controls), and
model behavior (exemplary actors and stories) to build cohesiveness (Griswold 2013). Small
groups play an integral role in managing individual members to maintain the function of the
organization. Think about the school or college you attend. There are many subcultures within
any educational setting and each group establishes the norms and behaviors members must
follow for social acceptance. Can you identify at least two subcultures on your school campus
and speculate how members of the group pressure each other to fit in?

On a group level, symbolic power matters in

recruiting members and sustaining the culture of a
group within the larger social culture (Hallet 2003).
Symbolic power is the power of constructing
reality to guide people in understanding their place
in the organizational hierarchy (Bourdieu 1991).
This power occurs in everyday interactions through
unconscious cultural and social domination. The
dominant group of an organization influences the
prevailing culture and provides its function in
communications forcing all groups or subcultures

dominant culture (Bourdieu 1991). The instrument
of symbolic power is the instrument of domination in the organization by creating the
ideological systems of its goals, purpose, and operations. Symbolic power not only governs
culture of the organization but also manages solidarity and division between groups. We see
examples of symbolic power in the military. Each branch of the military has a hierarchy of
authority where generals serve as the dominate group and are responsible for the prevailing
culture. Each rank socializes members according to their position within the organization in
relation to the hierarchy and fulfills their role to achieve collective goals and maintain functions.
CULTURAL SOLIDARITY
Describe the culture of an organization where you have worked, volunteered, or attended school.
1.
2.
3.

What are the stories and symbols that everyone who works, volunteers, or attends there knows?
What subculture groups exist within the organization, and what forms of conflict take place between units
or classifications?
How do the heads of the organization use symbolic power to motivate people?

There are external factors that influence organizational culture. The context and atmosphere of
a nation shapes an organization. When an organization’s culture aligns with national ideology,
they can receive special attention or privileges in the way of financial incentives or policy
changes (Griswold 2013). In contrast, organizations opposing national culture may face
suppression, marginalization, or be denied government and economic. Organizations must also
operate across a multiplicity of cultures (Griswold 2013). Culture differences between
organizations may affect their operations and achievement of goals. To be successful,
organizations must be able to operate in a variety of contexts and cultures. Griswold (2013)
suggested one way to work across cultural contexts is to maintain an overarching organizational
mission but be willing to adapt on insignificant or minor issues. Financial and banking
institutions use this approach. Depending on the region, banks offer different cultural
incentives for opening an account or obtaining a loan. In California, homeowners may obtain a
low interest loans for ecological improvements including installation of solar panels,
weatherproof windows, or drought resistance landscaping. In the state of Michigan, affluent

BEYOND RACE: CULTURAL INFLUENCES ON HUMAN SOCIAL LIFE

20

homeowners may acquire a low interest property improvement loan, and very low-income
homeowners may receive grants for repairing, improving, or modernizing their homes to
remove health and safety hazards.
Working across organizational cultures also requires some dimension of trust. Organizational
leaders must model forms and symbols of trust between organizations, groups, and individuals
(Mizrachi, Drori, and Anspach 2007). This means authority figures must draw on the
organization’s internal and external diversity of cultures to show its ability to adapt and work in
a variety of cultural and political settings and climates. Organizations often focus on internal
allegiance forgetting that shared meaning across the marketplace, sector, or industry is what
moves understanding of the overall system and each organization’s place in it (Griswold 2013).
The lack of cultural coordination and understanding undermines many organizations and has
significant consequences for accomplishing its goals and ability to sustain itself.
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE
Consider the culture of an organization where you have worked, volunteered, or attended school. Describe a
time when you witnessed someone receive a nonverbal, negative sanction (e.g., a look of disgust, a shake of
the head, or some other nonverbal sign of disapproval).
1.

What organizational norm was being broken (i.e., what was the act that led the person to give a nonverbal
negative sanctioning)?
Was the norm broken considered a structural or cultural violation?
What was the reaction of the norm violator to the negative sanction?
Was the norm being enforced a result of peer pressure, external forces, mimicking, or modeling?

Levels of Culture
There are three recognized levels of culture in society (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Each level of
culture signifies particular cultural traits and patterns within groups. International culture is
one level referring to culture that transcends national boundaries. These cultural traits and
patterns spread through migration, colonization, and the expansion of multinational
organizations (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Some illustrations are evident in the adoption and use
of technology and social media across continents. For example, computers and mobile devices
allow people to live and operate across national boundaries enabling them to create and
sustain an international culture around a common interest or purpose (i.e., Olympics, United
Nations, etc.).
In contrast, cultural traits and patterns shared within a country is national culture. National
culture is most easily recognizable in the form of symbols such as flags, logos, and colors as well
as sound including national anthems and musical styles. Think about American culture, which
values, beliefs, norms, and symbols are common only among people living in the United States?
How about those living in China and Brazil?

BEYOND RACE: CULTURAL INFLUENCES ON HUMAN SOCIAL LIFE

21

Subcultures, another level of culture, are subgroups of people within the same country (e.g.,
doctors, lawyers, teachers, athletes, etc.). Subcultures have shared experiences and common
cultural distinctions, but they blend into the larger society or cultural system. Subcultures have
their own set of symbols, meanings, and behavioral norms, which develop by interacting with
one another. Subcultures develop their own self-culture or idioculture that has significant
meaning to members of the group and creates social boundaries for membership and social
acceptance (Griswold 2013). Think about social cliques whether they be categorized as jocks,
nerds, hipsters, punks, or stoners. Each group has a particular subculture from the artifacts they
wear to the values and beliefs they exhibit. All groups form a subculture resulting in group
cohesion and shared consciousness among its members.
SPORT AS A SUBCULTURE
Research the sport, quadriplegic rugby. Examine the rules of the game, search for information or testimonials
about any of the athletes, and watch videos of game highlights and athlete stories or interviews available
online.
1.
2.
3.

Describe the subculture of the athletes (i.e., values, beliefs, symbols including meanings and expressions,
behavioral norms, and artifacts relevant to the game).
Discuss the socialization process of athletes into the sport.
Explain how social context, cultural creation, and cultural acceptance work to create the idioculture of
quadriplegic rugby.

Doing Culture
All people are cultured. Social scientists argue all people have a culture represented in values,
beliefs, norms, expressive symbols, practices, and artifacts. This viewpoint transcends the
humanities perspective that suggests one must project refined tastes, manners, and have a
good education as exhibited by the elite class to have culture. The perspective of social
scientists reinforce the ideology that cultures are integrated and patterned systems not simply
desired characteristics that distinguish the ruling class.
Cultural patterns are a set of integrated traits transmitted by communication or social
interactions (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Consider the cultural patterns associated with housing.
Each cultural group or society maintains a housing system comprised of particular cultural traits
including kitchen, sofa, bed, toilet, etc. The cultural traits or each individual cultural item is part
of the home or accepted cultural pattern for housing.
Not only do people share cultural traits, but they may also share personality traits. These traits
are actions, attitudes, and behaviors (e.g., honesty, loyalty, courage, etc.). Shared personality
traits develop through social interactions from core values within groups and societies (Kottak
and Kozaitis 2012). Core values are formally (legally or recognized) and informally (unofficial)
emphasized to develop a shared meaning and social expectations. The use of positive (reward)
and negative (punishment) sanctions help in controlling desired and undesired personality

22

traits. For example, if we want to instill courage, we might highlight people and moments
depicting bravery with verbal praise or accepting awards. To prevent cowardness, we show a
deserter or run-away to depict weakness and social isolation.
Doing culture is not always an expression of ideal culture. People’s practices and behaviors do
not always abide or fit into the ideal ethos we intend or expect. The Christmas holiday is one
example where ideal culture does not match the real culture people live and convey. Christmas
traditionally represents an annual celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ; however, many
individuals and families do not worship Christ or attend church on Christmas day but instead
exchange gifts and eat meals together. The ideal or public definition of Christmas does not
match the real or individual practices people express on the holiday. Throughout history, there
have always been differences between what people value (ideal culture) and how they actually
live their lives (real culture).
CULTURAL CHANGE
People biologically and culturally adapt. Cultural change or evolution is influenced directly (e.g.,
intentionally), indirectly (e.g., inadvertently), or by force. These changes are a response to
fluctuations in the physical or social environment (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Social movements
often start in response to shifting circumstances such as an event or issue in an effort to evoke
cultural change. People will voluntarily join for collective action to either preserve or alter a
cultural base or foundation. The fight over control of a cultural base has been the central
conflict among many civil and human rights movements. On a deeper level, many of these
movements are about cultural rights and control over what will be the prevailing or dominant
culture.
Changes in cultural traits are either adaptive (better suited for the environment) or
maladaptive (inadequate or inappropriate for the environment). During times of natural
disasters, people must make cultural changes to daily norms and practices such as donating
time and money to help relief efforts (adaptive) while also rebuilding homes and businesses.
However, not all relief efforts direct money, energy, or time into long-term contributions of
modifying physical infrastructures including roads, bridges, dams, etc. or helping people
relocate away from high disaster areas (maladaptive). People adjust and learn to cope with
cultural changes whether adaptive or maladaptive in an effort to soothe psychological or
emotional needs.
Though technology continues to impact changes in society, culture does not always change at
the same pace. There is a lag in how rapidly cultural changes occur. Generally, material culture
changes before non-material culture. Contact between groups diffuses cultural change among
groups, and people are usually open to adapt or try new artifacts or material possessions
before modifying their values, beliefs, norms, expressive symbols (i.e., verbal and non-verbal
language), or practices. Influencing fashion trends is easier than altering people’s religious
beliefs.

Through travel and technological communications, people are sharing cultural elements
worldwide. With the ability to travel and communicate across continents, time and space link
the exchange of culture. Modern society is operating on a global scale (known as globalization)
and people are now interlinked and mutually dependent. Acculturation or the merging of
cultures is growing. Groups are adopting the cultural traits and social patterns of other groups
leading to the blending of cultures. Cultural leveling is the process where cultures are
becoming similar to one another because of globalization.

MODULE 3: CULTURAL POWER
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
At the end of the module, students will be able to:
1. explain the implications of culture on social status and stratification
2. summarize the mechanisms used by dominant groups to develop and sustain cultural
power
3. understand cultural hegemony
4. describe the consequences of social conflicts over cultural power
5. identify and evaluate cultural prejudice and discrimination
CULTURAL HIERARCHIES
All humans are comprised of the same biological structure and matter. The unique distinctions
among us stem from our culture (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). The differences in our values,
beliefs, norms, expressive language, practices, and artifacts is which stands us apart from each
other. Being culturally unique projects exclusivity that draws attention to our variations and
differences. People find cultural fit or acceptance from those who share uniqueness or the
same cultural characteristics. Consequently, people may find or experience intolerance or
rejection from those with different cultural traits.
Cultural distinctions make groups unique, but they also provide a social structure for creating
and ranking cultures based on similarities or differences. A cultural group’s size and strength
influences their power over a region, area, or other groups. Cultural power lends itself to social
power that influences people’s lives by controlling the prevailing norms or rules and making
individuals adhere to the dominant culture voluntarily or involuntarily.
Culture is not a direct reflection of the social world (Griswold 2013). Humans mediate culture to
define meaning and interpret the social world around them. As a result, dominant groups able
to manipulate, reproduce, and influence culture among the masses. Common culture found in
society is actually the selective transmission of elite-dominated values (Parenti 2006). This
practice known as cultural hegemony suggests, culture is not autonomous, it is conditional
dictated, regulated, and controlled by dominant groups. The major forces shaping culture are in
the power of elite-dominated interests who make limited and marginal adjustments to appear
culture is changing in alignment with evolving social values (Parenti 2006). The culturally
dominating group often sets the standard for living and governs the distribution of resources.
Social and Cultural Capital
Social and cultural relationships have productive benefits in society. Research defines social
capital as a form of economic (e.g., money and property) and cultural (e.g., norms, fellowship,

26

trust) assets central to a social network (Putnam 2000). The social networks people create and
maintain with each other enable society to function. However, the work of Pierre Bourdieu
(1972) found social capital produces and reproduces inequality when examining how people
gain powerful positions through direct and indirect social connections. Social capital or a social
network can help or hinder someone personally and socially. For example, strong and
supportive social connections can facilitate job opportunities and promotion that are beneficial
to the individual and social network. Weak and unsupportive social ties can jeopardize
employment or advancement that are harmful to the individual and social group as well.
People make cultural objects meaningful (Griswold 2013). Interactions and reasoning develop
cultural perspectives and understanding. The “social mind” of groups process incoming signals
influencing culture within the social structure including the social attributes and status of
members in a society (Zerubavel 1999). Language and symbols express a person’s position in
society and the expectations associated with their status. For example, the clothes people wear
or car they drive represents style, fashion, and wealth. Owning designer clothing or a high
performance sports car depicts a person’s access to financial resources and worth. The use of
formal language and titles also represent social status such as salutations including your
majesty, your highness, president, director, chief executive officer, and doctor.
People may occupy multiple statuses in a society. At birth, people are ascribed social status in
alignment to their physical and mental features, gender, and race. In some cases, societies
differentiate status according to physical or mental disability as well as if a child is female or
male, or a racial minority. According to Dr. Jody Heymann, Dean of the World Policy Analysis
Center at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, "Persons with disabilities are one of the last
groups whose equal rights have been recognized" around the world (Brink 2016). A report by
the World Policy Analysis Center (2016) shows only 28% of 193 countries participating in the
global survey guarantee a right to quality education for people with disabilities and only 18%
guarantee a right to work.
In some societies, people may earn or achieve status from their talents, efforts, or
accomplishments (Griffiths et al. 2015). Obtaining higher education or being an artistic prodigy
often correspond to high status. For example, a college degree awarded from an “Ivy League”
university social weighs higher status than a degree from a public state college. Just as talented
artists, musicians, and athletes receive honors, privileges, and celebrity status.
Additionally, the social, political hierarchy of a society or region designates social status.
Consider the social labels within class, race, ethnicity, gender, education, profession, age, and
family. Labels defining a person’s characteristics serve as their position within the larger group.
People in a majority or dominant group have higher status (e.g., rich, white, male, physician,
etc.) than those of the minority or subordinate group (e.g., poor, black, female, housekeeper,
etc.). Overall, the location of a person on the social strata influences their social power and
participation (Griswold 2013). Individuals with inferior power have limitations to social and
physical resources including lack of authority, influence over others, formidable networks,
capital, and money.

Social status serves as method for building and maintaining boundaries among and between
people and groups. Status dictates social inclusion or exclusion resulting in cultural
stratification or hierarchy whereby a person’s position in society regulates their cultural
participation by others. Cultural attributes within social networks build community, group
loyalty, and personal and social identity.
People sometimes engage in status shifting to garner acceptance or avoid attention. DuBois
(1903) described the act of people looking through the eyes of others to measure social place
or position as double consciousness. His research explored the history and cultural experiences
of American slavery and the plight of black folk in translating thinking and behavior between
racial contexts. DuBois’ research helped sociologists understand how and why people display
one identity in certain settings and another in different ones. People must negotiate a social
situation to decide how to project their social identity and assign a label that fits (Kottak and
Kozaitis 2012). Status shifting is evident when people move from informal to formal contexts.
Our cultural identity and practices are very different at home than at school, work, or church.
Each setting demands different aspects of who we are and our place in the social setting.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CULTURAL CAPITAL

Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002)

This short video summarizes Pierre Bourdieu's (1930-2002) theory of cultural capital or “the cultural knowledge
that serves as currency that helps us navigate culture and alters our experiences and the opportunities available
to us.” The video discusses three different forms of cultural capital: embodied state, objectified state, and
institutionalized state with examples of each type that students can apply to their own lives. At the end of the
video, discussion questions are included to assist students in applying the concept of cultural capital to what is
happening in the world today. Prepare a written response addressing the four discussion questions presented in
the video to share with the class.

Sociologists find cultural capital or the social assets of person (including intellect, education,
speech pattern, mannerisms, and dress) promote social mobility (Harper-Scott and Samson
2009). People who accumulate and display the cultural knowledge of a society or group may

earn social acceptance, status, and power. Bourdieau (1991) explained the accumulation and
transmission of culture is a social investment from socializing agents including family, peers,
and community. People learn culture and cultural characteristics and traits from one another;
however, social status effects whether people share, spread, or communicate cultural
knowledge to each other. A person’s social status in a group or society influences their ability to
access and develop cultural capitol.
Cultural capital provides people access to cultural connections such as institutions, individuals,
materials, and economic resources (Kennedy 2012). Status guides people in choosing who and
when culture or cultural capital is transferable. Bourdieu (1991) believed cultural inheritance
and personal biography attributes to individual success more than intelligence or talent. With
status comes access to social and cultural capital that generates access to privileges and power
among and between groups. Individuals with cultural capital deficits face social inequalities
(Reay 2004). If someone does not have the cultural knowledge and skills to maneuver the social
world she or he occupies, then she or he will not find acceptance within a group or society and
access to support and resources.
COLLEGE SUCCESS AND CULTURAL CAPITAL
Cultural capital evaluates the validity of culture (i.e., language, values, norms, and access to material
resources) on success and achievement. You can measure your cultural capital by examining the cultural traits
and patterns of your life. The following questions examine student values and beliefs, parental and family
support, residency status, language, childhood experiences focusing on access to cultural resources (e.g.,
books) and neighborhood vitality (e.g., employment opportunities), educational and professional influences,
and barriers affecting college success (Kennedy 2012).

CULTURAL HEGEMONY
The very nature of cultural creation and production requires an audience to receive a cultural
idea or product. Without people willing to receive culture, it cannot be sustainable or become
an object (Griswold 2013). Power and influence play an integral part in cultural creation and
marketing. The ruling class has the ability to establish cultural norms and manipulate society
while turning a profit. Culture is a commodity and those in a position of power to create,
produce, and distribute culture gain further social and economic power.
Culture producing organizations such as multinational corporations and media industries are in
the business of producing mass culture products for profit. These organizations have the power
to influence people throughout the world. Paul Hirsch (1972) referred to this enterprise as the
culture industry system or the “market.” In the culture industry system, multinational
corporations and media industries (i.e., cultural creators) produce an excess supply of cultural
objects to draw in public attention with the goal of flooding the market to ensure receipt and
acceptance of at least one cultural idea or artifact by the people for monetary gain.
The culture industry system produces mass
culture products to generate a culture of
consumption (Grazian 2010). The production
of mass culture thrives on the notion that
culture influences people. In line with the
humanities’ perspective on culture,
multinational corporations and media
industries, believe they have the ability to
control and manipulate culture by creating
objects or products that people want and
desire. This viewpoint suggests cultural
receivers or the people are weak, apathetic,

and consume culture for recognition and
social status (Griswold 2013). If you consider
the cultural object of buying and owning a home, the concept of owning a home represents
attaining the “American dream.” Even though not all Americans are able to buy and own a
home, the cultural industry system has embedded home ownership as a requisite to success
and achievement in America.
In contrast, popular culture implies people influence culture. This perspective indicates people
are active makers in the creation and acceptance of cultural objects (Griswold 2013). Take into
account one of the most popular musical genres today, rap music. The creative use of language
and rhetorical styles and strategies of rap music gained local popularity in New York during the
1970s and entered mainstream acceptance in mid-1980s to early ‘90s (Caramanica 2005). The
early developments of rap music by the masses led to the genre becoming a cultural object.

IS BROWN THE NEW GREEN?
Latinos are the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. The culture industry system is
seeking ways to profit from this group. As multinational corporations and media industries produce cultural
objects or products geared toward this population, their cultural identity is transformed into a new subculture
blending American and Latino values, beliefs, norms, and practices. Phillip Rodriguez
(https://www.philliprodriguez.co/about/) is a documentary filmmaker on Latino culture, history, and identity.
He and many other race and diversity experts are exploring the influence of consumption on American Latino
culture.

Research the products and advertisements targeting Latinos in the United States. Describe the cultural
objects and messaging encouraging a culture of consumption among this group.
What type of values, beliefs, norms, and practices are reinforced in the cultural objects or projects created
by the culture industry system?
How might the purchase or consumption of the cultural objects or products you researched influence the
self-image, identity, and social status of Latinos?
What new subculture arises by the blending of American and Latino culture? Describe the impact of uniting
or combining these cultures on Latinos and Americans.

Today, rap music like other forms of music is being created and produced by major music labels
and related media industries. The culture industry system uses media gatekeepers to regulate
information including culture (Grazian 2010). Even with the ability of the people to create
popular culture, multinational corporations and media industries maintain power to spread
awareness, control access, and messaging. This power to influence the masses also gives the
hegemonic ruling class known as the culture industry system the ability to reinforce
stereotypes, close minds, and promote fear to encourage acceptance or rejection of certain
cultural ideas and artifacts.
PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION
Cultural intolerance may arise when individuals or groups confront new or differing values,
beliefs, norms, expressive symbols, practices, or artifacts. Think about a time when you came
across someone who did not fit the cultural “norm” either expressively or behaviorally. How did
the person’s presence make you feel? What type of thoughts ran through your head? Were you
compelled to understand the differences between you and the other person or were you eager
to dismiss, confront, or ignore the other person?
Living in a culturally diverse society requires us to tackle our anxiety of the unknown or

unfamiliar. The discomfort or cognitive dissonance we feel when we are around others who
live and think differently than ourselves makes us alter our thoughts and behaviors towards
acceptance or rejection of the “different” person in order to restore cognitive balance
(Festinger 1957). When people undergo culture shock or surprise from experiencing new
culture, their minds undergo dissonance. Similar to a fight or flight response, we choose to
learn and understand cultural differences or mock and run away from them.

People have a tendency to judge and evaluate each other on a daily basis. Assessing other
people and our surroundings is necessary for interpreting and interacting in the social world.
Problems arise when we judge others
using our own cultural standards. We call
the practice of judging others through our
own cultural lens, ethnocentrism. This
practice is a cultural universal. People
everywhere think their culture is true,
moral, proper, and right (Kottak and
Kozaitis 2012). By its very definition,
ethnocentrism creates division and
conflict between social groups whereby
mediating differences is challenging when
everyone believes they are culturally

standard for living.
In contrast, cultural relativism insinuates judging a culture by the standards of another is
objectionable. It seems reasonable to evaluate a person’s values, beliefs, and practices from
their own cultural standards rather than judged against the criteria of another (Kottak and
Kozaitis 2012). Learning to receive cultural differences from a place of empathy and
understanding serves as a foundation for living together despite variances. Like many aspects of
human civilization, culture is not absolute but relative suggesting values, beliefs, and practices
are only standards of living as long as people accept and live by them (Boas 1887). Developing
knowledge about cultures and cultural groups different from our own allows us to view and
evaluate others from their cultural lens.
Sometimes people act on ethnocentric thinking and feel justified disregarding cultural
relativism. Overcoming negative attitudes about people who are culturally different from us is
challenging when we believe our culture and thinking are justified. Consider the social issue of
infanticide or the killing of unwanted children after birth. The historical practice occurred in
times of famine or hardship when resources were scarce to keep non-productive humans alive.
Many people find infanticide a human rights violation regardless of a person’s cultural
traditions and beliefs and think the practice should stop. People often feel justified condemning
the practice of infanticide and the people who believe and practice the tradition.
Stereotypes are oversimplified ideas about groups of people (Griffiths et al. 2015). Prejudice is
an attitude of thoughts and feelings directed at someone from prejudging or making negative
assumptions. Negative attitudes about another’s culture is a form of prejudice or bias.
Prejudice is a learned behavior. Prejudicial attitudes can lead to discriminatory acts and
behaviors. Discrimination is an action of unfair treatment against someone based on
characteristics such as age, gender, race, religion, etc.

Thinking the practice of infanticide should stop and those who practice it malevolent is
prejudicial. Trying to stop the practice with force is discriminatory. There are times in the case
of human rights issues like this where the fine line between criticizing with action
(ethnocentrism) and understanding with empathy (cultural relativism) are clear. However,
knowing the appropriate context when to judge or be open-minded is not always evident. Do
we allow men to treat women as subordinates if their religion or faith justifies it? Do we allow
people to eat sea turtles or live octopus if it is a delicacy? Do we stop children who do not
receive vaccinations from attending school? All of these issues stem from cultural differences
and distinguishing the appropriate response is not always easy to identify.
When social groups have or are in power, they have the ability to discriminate on a large scale.
A dominant group or the ruling class impart their culture in society by passing laws and
informally using the culture industry system or “market” to spread it. Access to these methods
allows hegemonic groups to institutionalize discrimination. This results in unjust and unequal

treatment of people by society and its institutions. Those who culturally align to the ruling class

IDENTITY FORMATION
Trying to figure out who you are, what you value and believe, and why you think the way you
do is a lifelong process. In the first chapter of Thinking Well, Stewart E. Kelly suggests, “we all
have lenses through which we view reality, and we need to know what our individual lens is
composed of and how it influences our perception of reality.” Take a moment to reflect and
hypothetically paint a picture of yourself with words. Try to capture the core of your being by
describing who you are. Once you have formulated a description of yourself, evaluate what you
wrote. Does your description focus on your personal characteristics or your cultural
characteristics you learned from other people in your life (i.e., family, friends, congregation,
teachers, community, etc.)?
Cultural identity, like culture itself, is a social construct. The values, beliefs, norms, expressive
symbols, practices, and artifacts we hold develop from the social relationships we experience
throughout our lives. Not only does cultural identity make us aware of who we are, but it also
defines what we stand for in comparison to others. Cultural identity is relational between
individuals, groups, and society meaning through culture people are able to form social
connections or refrain from them. It is real to each of us with real social consequences.
As defined in Module 1, we learn culture through the process of enculturation. Socializing
agents including family, peers, school, work, and the media transmit traditions, customs,
language, tools, and common experiences and knowledge. The passage of culture from one
generation to the next ensures sustainability of that culture by instilling specific traits and
characteristics of a group or society that become part of each group member’s identity.
IDENTITY LABELS AND CATEGORIES
Identity shapes our perceptions and the way we categorize people. Our individual and collective
views influence our thinking. Regardless of personal, cultural, or universal identity people
naturally focus on traits, values, behaviors, and practices or behaviors they identify with and
have a tendency to dismiss those they do not.

Age Cohorts
Our numeric ranking of age is associated with particular cultural traits. Even the social
categories we assign to age express cultural characteristics of that age group or cohort. Age
signifies one’s cultural identity and social status (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Many of the most
common labels we use in society signify age categories and attributes. For example, the terms
“newborns and infants “generally refer to children from birth to age four, whereas “school-age
children” signifies youngsters old enough to attend primary school.
Each age range has social and cultural expectations placed upon by others (Kottak and Kozaitis
2012). We have limited social expectations of newborns, but we expect infants to develop some
language skills and behaviors like “potty training” or the practice of controlling bowel
movements. Even though cultural expectations by age vary across other social categories (e.g.,
gender, geography, ethnicity, etc.), there are universal stages and understanding of intellectual,
personal, and social development associated with each age range or cohort.
Throughout a person’s life course, they will experience and transition across different cultural
phases and stages. Life course is the period from one’s birth to death (Griffiths et al. 2015).
Each stage in the life course aligns with age-appropriate values, beliefs, norms, expressive
language, practices, and artifacts. Like other social categories, age can be a basis of social
ranking (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Society finds it perfectly acceptable for a baby or infant to
wear a diaper but considers it a taboo or fetish among an adult 30 years old. However, diaper
wearing becomes socially acceptable again as people age into senior years of life when
biological functions become harder to control. This is also an illustration of how people will
experience more than one age-based status during their lifetime.
Aging is a human universal (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Maneuvering life’s course is sometimes
challenging. Cultural socialization occurs throughout the life course. Learning the cultural traits
and characteristics needed at certain stages of life is important for developing self-identity and
group acceptance. People engage in anticipatory socialization to prepare for future life roles or
expectations (Griffiths et al. 2015). By engaging in social interactions with other people, we
learn the cultural traits, characteristics, and expectations in preparation for the next phase or
stage of life. Thinking back to “potty training” infants, parents and caregivers teach young
children to control bowel movements so they are able to urinate and defecate in socially
appropriate settings (i.e., restroom or outhouse) and times.
Generations have collective identity or shared experiences based on the time-period the group
lived. Consider the popular culture of the 1980s to today. In the 1980s, people used a landline
or fixed line phone rather than a cellular phone to communicate and went to a movie theater to
see a film rather than downloaded a video to a mobile device. Therefore, someone who spent
his or her youth and most of their adulthood without or with limited technology may not deem
it necessary to have or operate it in daily life. Whereas, someone born in the 1990s or later will
only know life with technology and find it a necessary part of human existence.

Each generation develops a perspective and
cultural identify from the time and events
surrounding their life. Generations experience
life differently resulting from cultural and social
shifts over time. The difference in life
experience alters perspectives towards values,
beliefs, norms, expressive symbols, practices,
and artifacts. Political and social events often
mark an era and influence generations. The
ideology of white supremacy reinforced by
events of Nazi Germany and World War II

beliefs in society. Many adults living at this
time believed the essays of Arthur Gobineau (1853-1855) regarding the existence of biologically
differences between racial groups (Biddis 1970). It was not until the 1960s and 1970s when
philosophers and critical theorists studied the underlying structures in cultural products and
used analytical concepts from linguistics, anthropology, psychology, and sociology to interpret
race discovering no biological or phenological variances between human groups and finding
race is a social construct (Black and Solomos 2000). Scientists found cultural likeness did not
equate to biological likeness. Nonetheless, many adults living in the 1930s and 1940s held racial
beliefs of white supremacy throughout their lives because of the ideologies spread and shared
during their lifetime. Whereas, modern science verifies the DNA of all people living today is
99.9% alike and a new generation of people are learning that there is only one human race
despite the physical variations in size, shape, skin tone, and eye color (Smithsonian 2018).
Because there are diverse cultural expectations based on age, there can be conflict between
age cohorts and generations. Age stratification theorists suggest that members of society are
classified and have social status associated to their age (Riley, Johnson, and Foner 1972).
Conflict often develops from age associated cultural differences influencing social and
economic power of age groups. For example, the economic power of working adults conflicts
with the political and voting power of the retired or elderly.
Age and generational conflicts are also highly influenced by government or state-sponsored
milestones. In the United States, there are several age-related markers including the legal age
of driving (16 years old), use of tobacco products (21 years old), consumption of alcohol ( 21
years old), and age of retirement (65-70 years old). Regardless of knowledge, skill, or condition,
people must abide by formal rules with the expectations assigned to the each age group within
the law. Because age serves as a basis of social control and reinforced by the state, different
age groups have varying access to political and economic power and resources (Griffiths et al.
2015). For example, the United States is the only industrialized nation that does not respect the
abilities of the elderly by assigning a marker of 65-70 years old as the indicator for someone to
become a dependent of the state and an economically unproductive member of society.

Sex and Gender
Each of us is born with physical characteristics
that represent and socially assign our sex and
gender. Sex refers to our biological differences
and gender the cultural traits assigned to
females and males (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012).
Our physical make-up distinguishes our sex as
either female or male implicating the gender
socialization process we will experience
throughout our life associated with becoming
a woman or man.
This image "Portrait of Young Man" by Pixabay is licensed under

Gender identity is an individual’s self-concept
CC0 1.0
of being female or male and their association
with feminine and masculine qualities. People teach gender traits based on sex or biological
composition (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Our sex signifies the gender roles (i.e., psychological,
social, and cultural) we will learn and experience as a member of society. Children learn gender
roles and acts of sexism in society through socialization (Griffiths et al. 2015). Girls learn
feminine qualities and characteristics and boys masculine ones forming gender identity.
Children become aware of gender roles between the ages of two and three and by four to five
years old, they are fulfilling gender roles based on their sex (Griffiths et al. 2015). Nonetheless,
gender-based characteristics do not always match one’s self or cultural identity as people grow
and develop.
GENDER LABELS
1. Why do people need and use gender labels?
2. Why do people create gender roles or expectations?
3. Do gender labels and roles influence limitations on individuals or the social world? Explain.

Gender stratification focuses on the unequal access females have to socially valued resources,
power, prestige, and personal freedom as compared to men based on differing positions within
the socio-cultural hierarchy (Light, Keller, and Calhoun 1997). Traditionally, society treats
women as second-class citizens in society. The design of dominant gender ideologies and
inequality maintains the prevailing social structure, presenting male privilege as part of the
natural order (Parenti 2006). Theorists suggests society is a male dominated patriarchy where
men think of themselves as inherently superior to women resulting in unequal distribution of
rewards between men and women (Henslin 2011).

Media portrays women and men in stereotypical ways that reflect and sustain socially endorsed
views of gender (Wood 1994). Media affects the perception of social norms including gender.
People think and act according to stereotypes associated with one’s gender broadcast by media
(Goodall 2016). Media stereotypes reinforce
gender inequality of girls and women. According
to Wood (1994), the underrepresentation women
in media implies that men are the cultural
standard and women are unimportant or invisible.
Stereotypes of men in media display them as
independent, driven, skillful, and heroic lending
them to higher-level positions and power in
society.
In countries throughout the world, including the
United States, women face discrimination in
wages, occupational training, and job promotion
(Parenti 2006). As a result, society tracks girls and
women into career pathways that align with gender roles and match gender-linked aspirations
such as teaching, nursing, and human services (Henslin 2011). Society views men’s work as
having higher value than that of women. Even if women have the same job as men, they make
77 cents per every dollar in comparison (Griffiths et al. 2015). Inequality in career pathways, job

Sitting" by rawpixel.com is licensed under CC0 1.0

placement, and promotion or advancement result in an income gap between genders effecting the
buying power and economic vitality of women in comparison to men.

The United Nations found prejudice and violence against women are firmly rooted in cultures
around the world (Parenti 2006). Gender inequality has allowed men to harness and abuse their
social power. The leading cause of injury among women of reproductive age is domestic
violence, and rape is an everyday occurrence and seen as a male prerogative throughout many
parts of the world (Parenti 2006). Depictions in the media emphasize male dominant roles and
normalize violence against women (Wood 1994). Culture plays an integral role in establishing
and maintaining male dominance in society ascribing men the power and privilege that
reinforces subordination and oppression of women.
Cross-cultural research shows gender stratification decreases when women and men make
equal contributions to human subsistence or survival (Sanday 1974). Since the industrial
revolution, attitudes about gender and work have been evolving with the need for women and
men to contribute to the labor force and economy. Gendered work, attitudes, and beliefs have
transformed in responses to American economic needs (Margolis 1984, 2000). Today’s society
is encouraging gender flexibility resulting from cultural shifts among women seeking college
degrees, prioritizing career, and delaying marriage and childbirth.

Sexuality and Sexual Orientation
Sexuality is an inborn person’s capacity for sexual feelings (Griffiths et al. 2015). Normative
standards about sexuality are different throughout the world. Cultural codes prescribe sexual
behaviors as legal, normal, deviant, or pathological (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). In the United
States, people have restrictive attitudes about premarital sex, extramarital sex, and
homosexuality compared to other industrialized nations (Griffiths et al. 2015). The debate on
sex education in U.S. schools focuses on abstinence and contraceptive curricula. In addition,
people in the U.S. have restrictive attitudes about women and sex, believing men have more

urges and therefore it is more acceptable for them to have multiple sexual partners than
women setting a double standard.
Sexual orientation is a biological expression of sexual desire or attraction (Kottak and Kozaitis
2012). Culture sets the parameters for sexual norms and habits. Enculturation dictates and
controls social acceptance of sexual expression and activity. Eroticism like all human activities
and preferences, is learned and malleable (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Sexual orientation labels
categorize personal views and representations of sexual desire and activities. Most people
ascribe and conform to the sexual labels constructed and assigned by society (i.e., heterosexual
or desire for the opposite sex, homosexual or attraction to the same sex, bisexual or appeal to
both sexes, and asexual or lack of sexual attraction and indifference).
The projection of one’s sexual personality is often
through gender identity. Most people align their
sexual disposition with what is socially or
publically appropriate (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012).
Because sexual desire or attraction is inborn,
people within the socio-sexual dominant group
(i.e., heterosexual) often believe their sexual
preference is “normal.” However, heterosexual
fit or type is not normal. History has documented
diversity in sexual preference and behavior since
the dawn of human existence (Kottak and Kozaitis
This image "Photo of Women Facing Each Other" by Brett
2012). There is diversity and variance in people’s

libido and psychosocial relationship needs.
Additionally, sexual activity or fantasy does not
always align to sexual orientation (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Sexual pleasure from use of sexual
toys, homoerotic images, or kinky fetishes do not necessarily correspond to a specific
orientation, sexual label, or mean someone’s desire will alter or convert to another type
because of the activity. Regardless, society uses sexual identity as an indicator of status
dismissing the fact that sexuality is a learned behavior, flexible, and contextual (Kottak and
Kozaitis 2012). People feel and display sexual variety, erotic impulses, and sensual expressions
throughout their lives.
Individuals develop sexual understanding around middle childhood and adolescence (APA
2008). There is no genetic, biological, developmental, social, or cultural evidence linked to
homosexual behavior. The difference is in society’s discriminatory response to homosexuality.
Alfred Kinsley was the first to identify sexuality is a continuum rather than a dichotomy of gay
or straight (Griffiths et al. 2015). His research showed people do not necessarily fall into the
sexual categories, behaviors, and orientations constructed by society. Eve Kosofky Sedgwick
(1990) expanded on Kinsley’s research to find women are more likely to express homosocial
relationships such as hugging, handholding, and physical closeness. Whereas, men often face
negative sanctions for displaying homosocial behavior.

Society ascribes meaning to sexual activities (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Variance reflects the
cultural norms and sociopolitical conditions of a time and place. Since the 1970s, organized
efforts by LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning) activists have helped
establish a gay culture and civil rights (Herdt 1992). Gay culture provides social acceptance for
persons rejected, marginalized, and punished by others because of sexual orientation and
expression. Queer theorists are reclaiming the derogatory label to help in broadening the
understanding of sexuality as flexible and fluid (Griffiths et al. 2015). Sexual culture is not
necessarily subject to sexual desire and activity, but rather dominant affinity groups linked by
common interests or purpose to restrict and control sexual behavior.
Geographic Region
The place people live or occupy renders a lifestyle and cultural identity. People identify with the
geographic location they live in as a part of who they are and what they believe (Kottak and
Kozaitis 2012). Places have subcultures specific to their geographic location, environmental
surroundings, and population.
As one of the largest cities in the United States, New York City is home to 21 million together
speaking over 200 languages (U.S. News and World Report 2017). The city itself is fast-paced
and its large population supports the need for around the clock services as the “city that never
sleeps.” With so many people living in the metropolis, it is a diverse melting pot of racial,
ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds though each neighborhood is its own enclave with its
own identity. This large, heterogeneous population effects the impersonal, sometimes
characterized as “dismissive and arrogant” attitudes of its residents. By the very nature and size
of the city, people are able to maintain anonymity but cannot develop or sustain intimacy with
the entire community or its residents. With millions of diverse people living, working, and
playing in 304 square miles, it is understandable why tourists or newcomers feel that residents
are in a rush, rude, and unfriendly.

On the opposite side of the nation in the Central
Valley of California, many residents live in rural
communities. The Central Valley is home to 6.5
million people across 18,000 square miles
(American Museum of Natural History 2018).
Though there is a large, metropolitan hub of
Fresno, surrounding communities identify
themselves as small, agricultural with a country
lifestyle. Here residents seek face-to-face
interactions and communities operate as kin or
families.

Like other social categories or labels, people use
location to denote status or lifestyle. Consider people in the U.S. who “live in Beverly Hills” or
“work on Wall Street.” These locations imply socio-economic status and privilege. Values of a

BEYOND RACE: CULTURAL INFLUENCES ON HUMAN SOCIAL LIFE

44

dominant regional culture marginalize those who do not possess or have the cultural
characteristics of that geographic location (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). People who do not
culturally fit in a place face social stigma and rejection.
People move to explore new areas, experience new cultures, or change status. Changing where
we live means changing our social and cultural surroundings including the family, friends,
acquaintances, etc. The most desirable spaces are distributed inequitably (Kottak and Kozaitis
2012). Wealth and privilege provide access to desirable locations and living conditions. The
poor, immigrants, and ethnic minorities are most likely to be concentrated in poor communities
with less than optimal living standards (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Impoverished groups are the
most likely to be exposed to environmental hazards and dangerous living conditions. The
disproportionate impact of ecological hazards on people of color has led to the development of
the environmental justice movement to abolish environmental racism and harm (Energy Justice
Network 2018).
Geographic places also convey or signify stereotypes. People living in or being from an area
inherent the region’s stereotypes whether they are accurate or not. Think about the previous
U.S. examples of “living in Beverly Hills” or “working on Wall Street.” Stereotypes associated
with these labels imply wealth and status. However, approximately 10% of people living in
Beverly Hills are living below the poverty rate and most people employed on Wall Street do not
work for financial institutions instead are police, sanitation workers, street vendors, and public
employees to name a few (Data USA 2018).
YOUR REGIONAL CULTURE
The place someone lives influences his or her value system and life. Describe the geographic location you live and
the culture of your community. What values and beliefs do the social norms and practices of your neighborhood
instill or project among residents? What type of artifacts or possessions (i.e., truck, luxury car, recreational vehicle,
fenced yard, swimming pool, etc.) do people living in your community seek out, dismiss, or condone? Do you
conform to the cultural standards where you live or deviate from them? Explain how the place you live influences
your perceptions, choices, and life.

Body and Mind
Like other human characteristics, society constructs meaning and defines normality to physical
and mental ability and appearance (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Behavior categorized as
“normal” is the standard for determining appropriate thinking and behavior from an illness or
disorder. An example of this construct is the criteria for determining mental illness that involves
examining a person’s functionality around accepted norms, roles, status, and behavior
appropriate for social situations and settings (Cockerham 2014). The difficulty in defining
mental disorders, similar to defining other illness or deformities, is the ever-changing
perspectives of society. For example, “homosexuality was considered a mental disorder by
American psychiatrists until the early 1970s” (Cockerham, 2014:3). Other terms and
classifications have either been eliminated or evolved over time including Melancholia (now

BEYOND RACE: CULTURAL INFLUENCES ON HUMAN SOCIAL LIFE

45

Depression), Amentia (once referred to Mental Retardation is no longer used), and Neurosis
(which is now classified into subtypes).
Primitive society believed mental illness derived from supernatural phenomena (Cockerham
2014). Because mental disorders were not always observable, people thought supernatural
powers were the cause of illness. These preliterate cultures assumed people became sick
because they lost their soul, invaded by an evil spirit, violated a taboo, or were victims of
witchcraft (Cockerham 2014). Witch doctors or shamans used folk medicine and religious
beliefs to produce cures. Many of these healers older in age, had high intellect, were
sometimes sexual deviants, orphans, disabled, or mentally ill themselves (Cockerham 2014).
Nonetheless, healers helped reduce anxiety and reinforce faith in social norms and customs.
Both physical and mental health conditions
become part of a person’s identity. Medical
professionals, as was the case with witch
doctors and shamans, play a role in labeling
illness or defect internalizing a person’s
condition as part of one’s identity (Kottak
and Kozaitis 2012). As a result, the culture
free, scientific objectivity of medicine has
come into question. For centuries in
western society, science sought to validate
religious ideologies and text including the
natural inferiority of women and the mental
and moral deficiencies of people of color

and the poor (Parenti 2006). Many scientific
opinions about the body and mind of
minority groups have been disproven and found to be embellished beliefs posing as objective
findings. Medicine and psychiatry like other aspects of social life have entrenched interests and
do not always come from a place of bias-free science.
People adopt behaviors to minimize the impact of their illness or ailment on others. A sick
person assumes a sick role when ill and not held responsible for their poor health or disorder,
the sick individual is entitled release from normal responsibilities and must take steps to regain
his or her health under care of a physician or medical expert (Parsons 1951). Because society
views illness as a dysfunction or abnormality, people who are ill or have a condition learn the
sick role or social expectations to demonstrate their willingness to cooperate with society
though they are unable to perform or maintain standard responsibilities (i.e., attend school,
work, participate in physical activity, etc.).
Social attributes around an ideal body and mind center on youthfulness and wellness without
deformity or defect. Though a person’s physical and mental health ultimately affects them
intrinsically, society influences the social or extrinsic experience related to one’s body and mind
attributes. People face social stigma when they suffer from an illness or condition. Erving

Goffman (1963) defined stigma as an unwanted characteristic that is devalued by society.
Society labels health conditions or defects (e.g., cancer, diabetes, mental illness, disability, etc.)
as abnormal and undesirable creating a negative social environment for people with physical or
mental differences.
Individuals with health issues or disparities face suspicion, hostility, or discrimination (Giddens,
Duneier, Applebaum, and Carr 2013). Social stigma accentuates one’s illness or disorder
marginalizing and alienating persons with physical or cognitive limitations. During the Middle
Ages, the mentally ill were categorized as fools and village idiots. Some people were tolerated
for amusement, others lived with family, and some were placed on ships for placement at a
distant place (Cockerham 2014). People often blame the victim suggesting one’s illness or
disability resulted from personal choice or behavior, and it is their responsibility to resolve,
cope, and adapt. Blaming the victim ignores the reality that an illness or defect is always be
preventable, people cannot always afford health care or purchase the medications to prevent
or alleviate conditions, and care or treatment is not always available.
Social stigma often results in individuals avoiding treatment for fear of social labeling, rejection,
and isolation. One in four persons worldwide will suffer a mental disorder in their lifetime
(Cockerham 2014). In a recent study of California residents, data showed approximately 77% of
the population with mental health needs received no or inadequate treatment (Tran and Ponce
2017). Children, older adults, men, Latinos, and Asians, people with low education, the
uninsured, and limited English speakers were most likely to have an unmet need of treatment.
Respondents in the study reported the cost of treatment and social stigma were the
contributing factors to not receiving treatment. Untreated mental disorders have high
economic and social costs including alcoholism, drug abuse, divorce, domestic violence, suicide,
and unemployment (Cockerham 2014). The lack of treatment have devastating effects on those
in need, their families, and society.
Society promotes health and wellness as the norm and ideal life experience. Media upholds
these ideals by portraying the body as a commodity and the value of being young, fit, and
strong (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). This fitness-minded culture projects individuals who are
healthy and well with greater social status than those inflicted with illness or body and mind
differences. In today’s society, there is low tolerance for unproductive citizens characterized by
the inability to work and contribute to the economy. Darwinian (1859) ideology embedded in
modern day principles promote a culture of strength, endurance, and self-reliance under the
guise of survival of the fittest. This culture reinforces the modern-day values of productivity
associated to one being healthy and well in order to compete, conquer, and be successful in
work and life.
There are body and mind differences associated with age, gender, and race. Ideal, actual, and
normal body characteristics vary from culture to culture and even within one culture over time
(Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Nonetheless, cultures throughout the world are obsessed with
youth and beauty. We see examples of this in media and fashion where actors and models are
fit to match regional stereotypes of the young and beautiful. In the United States, most

Hollywood movies portray heroines and heroes who are fit without ailment or defect, under
the age of 30, and reinforce beauty labels of hyper-femininity (i.e., thin, busty, sexy,
cooperative, etc.) and hyper-masculinity (i.e., built, strong, aggressive, tough, etc.). The fashion
industry also emphasizes this body by depicting unrealistic ideals of beauty for people to
compare themselves while nonetheless achievable by buying the clothes and products models
sell.
Body and mind depictions in the media and fashion create appearance stereotypes that imply
status and class. If one contains the resources to purchase high-end brands or expense apparel,
she or he are able to project status through wealth. If one is attractive, she or he are able to
project status through beauty. Research shows stereotypes influence the way people speak to
each other. People respond warm and friendly to attractive people and cold, reserved, and
humorless to unattractive (Snyder 1993). Additionally, attractive people earn 10-15% more
than ordinary or unattractive people (Judge et al. 2009; Hamermesh 2011). We most also note,
if one is able to achieve beauty through plastic surgery or exercise and have no health
conditions or deformities, they are also more likely to be socially accepted and obtain status.
People with disabilities have worked to dispel misconceptions, promote nondiscrimination, and
fair representation (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Individuals with body and mind illnesses and
differences form support groups and establish membership or affinity based on their condition
to organize politically. By acknowledging differences and demanding civil rights, people with
illnesses and disabilities are able to receive equal treatment and protection under the law
eliminating the stigma and discriminatory labels society has long placed on them. Political
organization for social change has given people with body and mind differences the ability to
redefine culture and insist on social inclusion and participation of all people regardless of
physical or mental differences, challenges, or limitations.
An illustration of civil rights changes occurred in the 20th century with a paradigm shift and
growth of professionals, paraprofessionals, and laypeople in mental health (Cockerham 2014).
Treatment altered to focus on psychoanalysis and psychoactive drugs rather than
institutionalization. With this new approach, hospital discharges increased and hospitalization
stays decreased (Cockerham 2014). The most recent revolution in mental health treatment was
the development of the community mental health model. The model emphasizes local
community support as a method of treatment where relationships are the focus of care. This
therapeutic approach uses mental health workers who live in the community to fill the service
gaps between the patient and professionals stressing a social rather than medical model
(Cockerham 2014). The community mental health model extends civil rights putting consent to
treatment and service approach in the hands of patients.
Race and Ethnicity
There are two myths or ideas about race. The first suggests people inherit physical
characteristics distinguishing race. Second, the idea that one race is superior to others or that
one “pure” race exists. In actuality, scientific research mapping of the human genome system

found that humans are homogenous (Henslin 2011). Race is truly an arbitrary label that has
become part of society’s culture with no justifiable evidence to support differences in physical
appearance substantiate the idea that there are a variety of human species. Traditionally, racial
terms classify and stratify people by appearance and inherently assign racial groups as inferior
or superior in society (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Scientific data finds only one human species
making up only one human race. Evidence shows physical differences in human appearance
including skin color are a result of human migration patterns and adaptions to the environment
(Jablonski 2012). Nonetheless, people use physical characteristics to identify, relate, and
interact with one another.
Ethnicity refers to the cultural characteristics related to ancestry and heritage. Ethnicity
describes shared culture such as group practices, values, and beliefs (Griffiths et al. 2015).
People who identify with an ethnic group share common cultural characteristics (i.e.,
nationality, history, language, religion, etc.). Ethnic groups select rituals, customs, ceremonies,
and other traditions to help preserve shared heritage (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Lifestyle
requirements and other identity characteristics such as geography and region influence how we
adapt our ethnic behaviors to fit the context or setting in which we live. Culture is also key in
determining how human bodies grow and develop such as food preferences and diet and
cultural traditions promote certain activities and abilities including physical well-being and
sport (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Someone of Mexican decent living in Central California who is
a college professor will project different ethnic behaviors than someone of the same ethnic
culture who is a housekeeper in Las Vegas, Nevada. Differences in profession, social class, and
region will influence each person’s lifestyle, physical composition, and health though both may
identify and affiliate themselves as Mexican.
Not all people see themselves as belonging to an ethnic group or view ethnic heritage as
important to their identity. People who do not identify with an ethnic identity either have no
distinct cultural background because their ancestors come from a variety of cultural groups and
offspring have not maintained a specific culture, instead have a blended culture, or they lack
awareness about their ethnic heritage (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). It may be difficult for some
people to feel a sense of solidarity or association with any specific ethnic group because they
do not know where their cultural practices originated and how their cultural behaviors adapted
over time. What is your ethnicity? Is your ethnic heritage very important, somewhat important,
or not important in defining who you are? Why?
Race and ethnic identity like other cultural characteristics influence social status or position in
society. Minority groups are people who receive unequal treatment and discrimination based
on social categories such as age, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, religious beliefs, or socioeconomic class. Minority groups are not necessarily numerical minorities (Griffith et al. 2015).
For example, a large group of people may be a minority group because they lack social power.
The physical and cultural traits of minority groups “are held in low esteem by the dominant or
majority group which treats them unfairly” (Henslin 2011:217). The dominant group has higher
power and status in society and receives greater privileges. As a result, the dominant group
uses its position to discriminate against those that are different. The dominant group in the

United States is represented by white,
middle-class, Protestant people of
northern European descent (Doane
2005). Minority groups can garner
power by expanding political
boundaries or through expanded
migration though both of these efforts
do not occur with ease and require
societal support from minority and
dominant group members. The loss of
power among dominant groups
threatens not only their authority over
other groups but also the privileges
and way of life established by the
majority.

There are seven patterns of intergroup relations between dominant and minority groups
influencing not only the racial and ethnic identity of people but also the opportunities and
barriers each will experience through social interactions. Maladaptive contacts and exchanges
include genocide, population transfer, internal colonialism, and segregation. Genocide
attempts to destroy a group of people because of their race or ethnicity. “Labeling the targeted
group as inferior or even less than fully human facilitates genocide” (Henslin 2011:225).
Population transfer moves or expels a minority group through direct or indirect transfer.
Indirect transfer forces people to leave by making living conditions unbearable, whereas, direct
transfer literally expels minorities by force.
Another form of rejection by the dominant group is a type of colonialism. Internal colonialism
refers to a country’s dominant group exploiting the minority group for economic advantage.
Internal colonialism generally accompanies segregation (Henslin 2011). In segregation, minority
groups live physically separate from the dominant group by law.
Three adaptive intergroup relations include assimilation, multiculturalism, and pluralism. The
pattern of assimilation is the process by which a minority group assumes the attitudes and
language of the dominant or mainstream culture. An individual or group gives up its identity by
taking on the characteristics of the dominant culture (Griffiths et al. 2015). When minorities
assimilate by force to dominant ideologies and practices, they can no longer practice their own
religion, speak their own language, or follow their own customs. In permissible assimilation,
minority groups adopt the dominant culture in their own way and at their own speed (Henslin
2011).
Multiculturalism is the most accepting intergroup relationship between dominant and minority
groups. Multiculturalism or pluralism encourages variation and diversity. Multiculturalism
promotes affirmation and practice of ethnic traditions while socializing individuals into the
dominant culture (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). This model works well in diverse societies

comprised of a variety of cultural groups and a political system supporting freedom of
expression. Pluralism is a mixture of cultures where each retains its own identity (Griffiths et al.
2015). Under pluralism, groups exist separately and equally while working together such as
through economic interdependence where each group fills a different societal niche then
exchanges activities or services for the sustainability and survival of all. Both the multicultural
and pluralism models stress interactions and contributions to their society by all ethnic groups.

Race reflects a social stigma or marker of superiority (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). When
discrimination centers on race, it is racism. There are two types of racial discrimination:
individual and institutional. Individual discrimination is “unfair treatment directed against
someone” (Henslin 2011:218). Whereas, institutional discrimination is negative systematic
treatment of individuals by society through education, government, economy, health care, etc.
According to Perry (2000), when people focus on racial-ethnic differences, they engage in the
process of identity formation through structural and institutional norms. As a result, racialethnic identity conforms to normative perceptions people have of race and ethnicity reinforcing
the structural order without challenging the socio-cultural arrangement of society. Maintaining
racial-ethnic norms reinforces differences, creates tension, and disputes between racial-ethnic
groups sustaining the status quo and reasserting the dominant groups position and hierarchy in
society.
Upon the establishment of the United States, white legislators and leaders limited the roles of
racial minorities and made them subordinate to those of white Europeans (Konradi and
Schmidt 2004). This structure systematically created governmental and social disadvantages for
minority groups and people of color. Today, toxic waste dumps continue to be
disproportionately located in areas with nonwhite populations (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). It has
taken over 200 years to ensure civil rights and equal treatment of all people in the United
States; however, discriminatory practices continue because of policies, precedents, and
practices historically embedded in U.S. institutions and individuals behaving from ideas of racial
stereotypes. Think about the differences people have in employment qualifications,
compensation, obtaining home loans, or getting into college. What racial and ethnic
stereotypes persist about different racial and ethnic groups in these areas of life?

Whites in the United States infrequently experience racial discrimination making them unaware
of the importance of race in their own and others’ thinking in comparison to people of color or
ethnic minorities (Konradi and Schmidt 2004). Many argue racial discrimination is outdated and
are uncomfortable with the blame, guilt, and accountability of individual acts and institutional
discrimination. By paying no attention to race, people think racial equality is an act of color
blindness and it will eliminate racist atmospheres (Konradi and Schmidt 2004). They do not
realize the experience of not “seeing” race itself is racial privilege. Research shows the
distribution of resources and opportunities are not equal among racial and ethnic categories,
and White groups do better than other groups and Blacks are predominantly among the
underclass (Konradi and Schmidt 2004). Regardless of social perception, in reality, there are
institutional and cultural differences in government, education, criminal justice, and media and
racial-ethnic minorities received subordinate roles and treatment in society.
Religion and Belief Systems
The concept of a higher power or spiritual truth is a cultural universal. Like ethnicity, religion is
the basis of identity and solidarity (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). People’s beliefs and faith support
their values, norms, and practices. Individual faith influences one’s extrinsic motivation and
behaviors including treatment of others.
Religion is malleable and adaptive for it
changes and adapts within cultural and
social contexts. Human groups have diverse
beliefs and different functions of their faith
and religion. Historically, religion has driven
both social union and division (Kottak and
Kozaitis 2012). When religious groups unite,
they can be a strong mobilizing force;
however, when they divide, they can work
to destroy each other.

Religion may be formal or informal (Kottak
and Kozaitis 2012). Someone who is a
member of an organized religious group, attends religious services, and practices rituals is a
participant in formal or institutional religion. Whereas, someone participating in informal
religion may or may not be a member of an organized religious group and experiencing a
communal spirit, solidarity, and togetherness through shared experience. Informal religion may
occur when we participate as a member of a team or during a group excursion such as camp.
Religion is a vehicle for guiding values, beliefs, norms, and practices. People learn religion
through socialization. The meaning and structure of religion controls lives through sanctions or
rewards and punishments. Religion prescribes to a code of ethics to guide behavior (Kottak and
Kozaitis 2012). One who abides by religious teachings receives rewards such as afterlife and one
who contradicts its instruction accepts punishment including damnation. People engage in

religion and religious practices because they think it works (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). The
connection between religious faith and emotion sustains belief playing a strong role on
personal and social identity. What formal or informal religious experiences have you
encountered during your life? How does your faith and spirituality conform or deviate from
your family of origin and friends?
Social Class
A person’s socio-economic status influences her or his personal and social identity. In society,
we rank individuals on their wealth, power, and prestige (Weber [1968] 1978). The calculation
of wealth is the addition of one’s income and assets minus their debts. The net worth of a
person is wealth whereas income from work and investments is the resources a person has
available to access. Power is the ability to influence others directly or indirectly and prestige is
the esteem or respect associated with social status (Carl 2013). This social stratification system
or ranking creates inequality in society and determines one’s social position in areas such as
income, education, and occupation.
Multiple factors influence social standing, however, people often assume hard work and effort
leads to a high status and wealth. Socialization reinforces the ideology that social stratification
is a result of personal effort or merit (Carl 2013). The concept of meritocracy is a social ideal or
value, but no society exists where the determination of social rank is purely on merit.
Inheritance alone shows social standing is not always individually earned. Some people have to
put little to no effort to inherit social status and wealth. Additionally, societies operating under
a caste system where birth determines lifelong status undermines meritocracy. Caste systems
function on the structure that someone born into a low-status group remains low status
regardless of their accomplishments, and those born into high-status groups stay high status
(Henslin 2011). The caste system reinforces ascribed status rather than achieved to ensure
sustainment of multiple roles and occupations in society.
In modern societies, there is evidence of merit based standing in academics and job
performance but other factors such as age, disability, gender, race, and region influence life’s
opportunities and challenges for obtaining social standing. A major flaw of meritocracy is how
society measures social contributions. Janitorial and custodial work is necessary in society to
reduce illness and manage waste just as much as surgery is to keep people healthy and alive,
but surgeons receive greater rewards than janitors do for their contributions.
Marx and Engels (1967) suggested there is a social class division between the capitalists who
control the means of production and the workers. In 1985, Erik Wright interjected that people
can occupy contradictory class positions throughout their lifetime. People who have occupied
various class positions (e.g., bookkeeper to manager to chief operating officer) relate to the
experiences of others in those positions, and as a result may feel internal conflict in handling
situations between positions or favoring one over another. Late in the twentieth century,
Joseph Kahl and Dennis Gilbert (1992) updated the theoretical perspective of Max Weber by
developing a six-tier model portraying the United States class structure including underclass,

working-poor, working, lower middle, upper middle, and capitalists. The social class model
depicts the distribution of property, prestige, and power among society based on income and
education.
Each class lifestyle requires a certain level of wealth in order to acquire the material necessities
and comforts of life (Henslin 2011). The correlation between the standard of living and quality
of life or life chances (i.e., opportunities and barriers) influences one’s ability to afford food,
shelter, clothing, healthcare, other basic needs, and luxury items. A person’s standards of living
including income, employment, class, and housing effects their cultural identity.
Social class serves as a marker or indication of resources. These markers are noticeable in the
behaviors, customs, and norms of each stratified group (Carl 2013). People living in
impoverished communities have different cultural norms and practices compared to those with
middle incomes or families of wealth. For example, the urban poor often sleep on cardboard
boxes on the ground or on sidewalks and feed themselves by begging, scavenging, and raiding
garbage (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Middle income and wealth families tend to sleep in housing
structures and nourish themselves with food from supermarkets or restaurants.
Language and fashion also vary among
these classes because of educational
attainment, employment, and income.
People will use language like “white trash”
or “welfare mom” to marginalize people in
the lower class and use distinguished labels
to identify the upper class such as “noble”
and “elite.” Sometimes people often engage
in conspicuous consumption or purchase
and use certain products (e.g., buy a luxury
car or jewelry) to make a social statement

Nonetheless, the experience of poor people
is very different in comparison to others in
the upper and middle classes and the lives of people within each social class may vary based on
their position within other social categories including age, disability, gender, race, region, and
religion.
Similar to people, nations are also stratified. The most extreme social class differences are
between the wealthiest in industrialized countries and the poorest in the least developed
nations (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). The most industrialized or modern countries have the
greatest property and wealth. Most industrialized nations are leaders in technology and
progress allowing them to dominant, control, and access global resources. Industrializing
nations have much lower incomes and standards of living than those living in most
industrialized nations (Henslin 2011). The least industrialized nations are not modern, and
people living in these nations tend to be impoverished and live on farms and in villages.

IDENTITY TODAY
All forms of media and technology teach culture including values, norms, language, and
behaviors by providing information about activities and events of social significance (Griffiths et
al. 2015). Media and technology socialize us to think and act within socio-cultural appropriate
norms and accepted practices. Watching and listening to people act and behave through media
and technology shows the influence this social institution has like family, peers, school, and
work on teaching social norms, values, and beliefs.
Technological innovations and advancements have influenced social interactions and
communication patterns in the twenty-first century creating new social constructions of reality.
These changes, particularly in information technology, have led to further segmentation of
society based on user-participant affinity groups (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). The internet and
web-based applications link people together transecting local, state, and national boundaries
centered on common interests. People who share interests, ideas, values, beliefs, and practices
are able to connect to one another through web-based and virtual worlds. These shared
interests create solidarity among user-participants while disengaging them from others with
differing or opposing interests. Cybersocial interactions have reinforced affinity groups creating
attitudes and behaviors that strongly encourage tribalism or loyalty to the social group and
indifference to others.
Even though there are so many media, news, and information outlets available online, they are
homogenous and tell the same stories using the same sources delivering the same message
(McManus 1995). Regardless of the news or information outlets one accesses, the coverage of
events is predominantly the same with differences focusing on commentary, perspective, and
analysis. Shoemaker and Vos (2009) found this practice allow outlets to serve as gatekeepers by
shaping stories and messages into mass media-appropriate forms and reducing them to a
manageable amount for the audience. Fragmentation of stories and messages occurs solely on
ideology related to events rather than actual coverage of accounts, reports, or news.
People no longer form and take on identity solely from face-to-face interactions; they also
construct themselves from online communication and cybersocial interactions. Approximately
73 percent of adults engage in some sort of online social networking extending their cultural
identity to virtual space and time (Pew Research Center 2011). Technological innovations and
advancements have even led some people to re-construct a new online identity different from
the one they are in face-to-face contexts. Both identities and realities are real to the people
who construct and create them, as they are the cultural creators of their personas.
Technology like other resources in society creates inequality among social groups (Griffiths et
al. 2015). People with greater access to resources have the ability to purchase and use online
services and applications. Privilege access to technological innovations and advancements
depend on one’s age, family, education, ethnicity, gender, profession, race, and social class
(Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Signs of technological stratification are visible in the increasing
knowledge gap for those with less access to information technology. People with exposure to

technology gain further proficiency that makes them more marketable and employable in
modern society (Griffiths et al. 2015). Inflation of the knowledge gap results from the lack of
technological infrastructure among races, classes, geographic areas creating a digital divide
between those who have internet access and those that do not.

MODULE 5: THE MULTICULTURAL WORLD
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
At the end of the module, students will be able to:
1. understand the influence of globalization on culture and cultural identity
2. differentiate between the social patterns of cultural homogenization and cultural
heterogenization
3. explain the role of technological advancements on cultural creation and transmission
4. summarize the process for creating cultural awareness and building cultural intelligence
5. demonstrate methods and approaches for working with others in a culturally diverse
society
GLOBALIZATION AND IDENTITY
Everyday production of culture centers on local and global influences (Giddens 1991). With the
advancements in technology and communications, people are experiencing greater social
forces in the construction of their cultural reality and identity. The boundaries of locality have
expanded to global and virtual contexts that create complexities in understanding the creation,
socialization, adaptation, and sustainability of culture.
Globalization is typically associated to the creation of world-spanning free market and global
reach of capitalist systems resulting from technological advances (Back, Bennett, Edles, Gibson,
Inglis, Jacobs, and Woodward 2012). However, globalization has the unintended consequences
of connecting every person in the world to each other. In this era, everyone’s life is connected
to everyone else’s life in obvious and hidden
ways (Albrow 1996). A food production
shortage in the United States effects the
overall economic and physical well-being
and livelihoods of people throughout the
world in an obvious way. Our hidden
connections stem from the individuals who
grow, produce, and transport the food
people eat. It is easier for people to
recognize the big picture or
macrosociological influences we have on
each other, but sometimes harder to

other across the globe.
Globalization also influences our cultural identity and affinity groups. Technology allows us to
eliminate communication boundaries and interact with each other on a global scale.

BEYOND RACE: CULTURAL INFLUENCES ON HUMAN SOCIAL LIFE

Globalization lends itself to cultural homogenization that is the world becoming culturally
similar (Back et al. 2012). However, the cultural similarities we now share center on capitalist
enterprises including fashion and fast food. Globalization has resulted in the worldwide spread
of capitalism (Back et al. 201). Transnational corporations or companies with locations
throughout the world like McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, and Nike dominate the global market with
goods and services spreading and embedding their cultural artifacts on a global scale. These
corporations increase the influence of global practices on people’s lives that sometimes result
in economic and social consequences including closing factories in one country and moving to
another where costs and regulations are lower.
Along with people throughout the world becoming culturally similar, sociologists also recognize
patterns of cultural heterogenization where aspects of our lives are becoming more complex
and differentiated resulting from globalization. Our social relationships and interactions have
become unconstrained by geography (Back et al.). People are no longer restricted to spatial
locales and are able to interact beyond time and space with those sharing common culture,
language, or religion (Giddens 1990; Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). People can travel across the
globe within hours, but also connect with others by phone or the Internet within seconds.
These advancements in technology and communications alters what people perceive as close
and far away (Back et al. 2012). Our social and cultural arrangements in an era of globalization
are adapting and changing the way we think and act.
Today people are able to form and live across national borders. Advances in transportation and
communications give people the opportunity to affiliate with multiple countries as
transnationals. At different times of their lives or different times of the year, people may live in
two or more countries.
We are moving beyond local, state, and national identities to broader identities developing
from our global interactions forming transnational communities. A key cultural development
has been the construction of globality or thinking of the whole earth as one place (Beck 2000).
Social events like Earth Day and the World Cup of soccer are examples of globality. People
associate and connect with each other in which they identify. Today people frame their thinking
about who they are within global lenses of reference (Back et al. 2012). Even in our global and
virtual interactions, people align themselves with the affinity groups relative to where they
think they belong and will find acceptance. Think about your global and virtual friend and peer
groups. How did you meet or connect? Why do you continue to interact? What value do you
have in each other’s lives even though you do not physical interact?

OUR ONLINE FUTURE
Research three online sources on how online interactions and social media influence human social life such as the
following:


The Future of the Web May Not be Social by Mitch Joel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh0obyhZPM8)

1. What is the relationship between inputting information online and privacy?
2. Do you think the web re-enforces narcissism? How does narcissistic behavior influence our connections to
the social world and other people?
3. Even if we choose NOT to participate or be part of the online universe, how does the behavior of other
people online affect what the world knows about us?
4. Should everything we do online be open and available to the public? Who should be able to view your
browsing patterns, profile, photos, etc.?
5. What rights do you think people should have in controlling their privacy online?

CULTURE TODAY
With the world in flux from globalization and technological advances, people are developing
multiple identities apparent in their local and global linkages. Cultural identity is becoming
increasingly contextual in the postmodern world where people transform and adapt depending
on time and place (Kottak and Kozaitis 2012). Social and cultural changes now adapt in
response to single events or issues. The instant response and connections to others beyond
time and place immediately impacts our lives, and we have the technology to react quickly with
our thoughts and actions.

Laptop" by Christina Morillo is licensed under CC BY 4.0

Approximately two-thirds of American adults
are online connecting with others, working,
studying, or learning (Griswold 2013). The
increasing use of the Internet makes virtual
worlds and cybersocial interactions powerful
in constructing new social realities. Having a
networked society allows anyone to be a
cultural creator and develop an audience by
sharing their thoughts, ideas, and work
online. Amateurs are now cultural creators
and have the ability to control dissemination
of their creations (Griswold 2013). Individuals
now have the freedom to restrict or share
cultural meaning and systems.

Postmodern culture and the new borderless world fragments traditional social connections
into new cultural elements beyond place, time, and diversity without norms. People can now
live within global electronic cultural communities and reject cultural meta-narratives (Griswold
2013). Postmodern culture also blurs history by rearranging and juxtaposing unconnected signs

to produce new meanings. We find references to actual events in fictional culture and fictional
events in non-fictional culture (Barker and Jane 2016). Many U.S. television dramas refer to
9/11 in episodes focusing on terrorists or terrorist activities. Additionally, U.S. social activities
and fundraising events will highlight historical figures or icons. The blurring of non-fiction and
fiction creates a new narrative or historical reality people begin to associate with and recognize
as actual or fact.

How has globalization and technology changed culture and cultural tastes?
How have people harnessed these changes into cultural objects or real culture?
How do you envision the growth or transformation of receivers or the audience as participants in cultural
production?
What cultural objects are threatened in the age of postmodern culture?

BUILDING CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE
In a cultural diverse society, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to interact
effectively with others. Our ability to communicate and interact with each other plays an
integral role in the successful development of our relationships for personal and social
prosperity. Building cultural intelligence requires active awareness of self, others, and context
(Bucher 2008). Self-awareness requires an understanding of our cultural identity including
intrinsic or extrinsic bias we have about others and social categories of people. Cultural
background greatly influences perception and understanding, and how we identify ourselves
reflects on how we communicate and get along with others. It is easier to adjust and change
our interactions if we are able to recognize our own uniqueness, broaden our percepts, and
respect others (Bucher 2008). We must be aware of our cultural identity including any multiple
or changing identities we take on in different contexts as well as those we keep hidden or hide
to avoid marginalization or recognition.
Active awareness of others requires us to use new
cultural lenses. We must learn to recognize and
appreciate commonalities in our culture not just
differences. This practice develops understanding
of each other’s divergent needs, values, behaviors,
interactions, and approach to teamwork (Bucher
2008). Understanding others involves evaluating
assumptions and cultural truths. Cultural lens filter
perceptions of others and conditions us to view

the world and others in one way blinding us from

what we have to offer or complement each other
(Bucher 2008). Active awareness of others broadens one’s sociological imagination to see the

world and others through a different lens and understand diverse perspectives that ultimately
helps us interact and work together effectively.
Today’s workplace requires us to have a global consciousness that encompasses awareness,
understanding, and skills to work with people of diverse cultures (Bucher 2008). Working with
diverse groups involves us learning about other cultures to manage complex and uncertain
social situations and contexts. What may be culturally appropriate or specific in one setting may
not apply in another. This means we must develop a cultural understanding of not only
differences and similarities, but those of cultural significance as well to identify which
interactions fit certain situations or settings.

How do you develop collaboration among people with different backgrounds and experiences?
What role does power play in our ability to collaborate with others and develop deep levels of
understanding?
How might power structures be created when one group tries to provide aid to another?
Research the Cultural Intelligence Center (https://culturalq.com/) and online videos on the topic of building
cultural intelligence such as Cultural Intelligence: A New Way of Thinking by Jeff Thomas
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3S76gAKp6Q&feature=youtu.be). Describe what information and
free services are available online to help people improve their knowledge and communication skills with
people of different cultural backgrounds and experiences.
Provide examples of how you will apply the following skills to develop global consciousness:
 Minimize culture shock
 Recognize ethnocentrism
 Practice cultural relativism
 Develop multiple consciousness
 Step outside your comfort zone

As we come into contact with diverse people, one of our greatest challenges will be managing
cross-cultural conflict. When people have opposing cultural values, beliefs, norms, or practices,
they tend to create a mindset of division or the “us vs. them” perspective. This act of loyalty to
one side or another displays tribalism and creates an ethnocentric and scapegoating
environment where people judge and blame each other for any issues or problems. Everyone
attaches some importance to what one values and believes. As a result, people from different
cultures might attach greater or lesser importance to family and work. If people are arguing
over the roles and commitment of women and men in the family and workplace, their personal
values and beliefs are likely to influence their willingness to compromise or listen to one
another. Learning to manage conflict among people from different cultural backgrounds
increases our ability to build trust, respect all parties, deal with people’s behaviors, and assess
success (Bucher 2008). How we deal with conflict influences productive or destructive results
for others and ourselves.
Self-assessment is key to managing cross-cultural conflicts. Having everyone involved in the
conflict assess herself or himself first and recognize their cultural realities (i.e., history and

biography) will help individuals see where they may clash or conflict with others. If someone
comes from the perspective of men should lead, their interactions with others will display
women in low regard or subordinate positions to men. Recognizing our cultural reality will help
us identify how we might be stereotyping and treating others and give us cause to adapt and
avoid conflict with those with differing realities.
Some form of cultural bias is evident in everyone (Bucher
2008). Whether you have preferences based on gender,
sexuality disability, region, social class or all social
categories, they affect your thoughts and interactions
with others. Many people believe women are nurturers
and responsible for child rearing, so they do not believe
men should get custody of the children when a family
gets a divorce. Bias serves as the foundation for
stereotyping and prejudice (Bucher 2008). Many of the
ideas we have about others are ingrained, and we have to
unlearn what we know to reduce or manage bias.
Removing bias perspectives requires resocialization
through an ongoing conscious effort in recognizing our
bias then making a diligent effort to learn about others to
dispel fiction from fact. Dealing with bias commands
personal growth and the biggest obstacles are our fears
and complacency to change.

Additionally, power structures and stratification emerge
in cross-cultural conflicts. The dynamics of power impact each of us (Bucher 2008). Our
assumptions and interactions with each other is a result of our position and power in a
particular context or setting. The social roles and categories we each fall into effect how and
when we respond to each other. A Hispanic, female, college professor has the position and
authority to speak and control conflict of people in her classroom but may have to show
deference and humility when conflict arises at the Catholic Church she attends. The professor’s
position in society is contextual and in some situations, she has the privileges of power, but in
others, she may be marginalized or disregarded.
Power effects how others view, relate, and interact with us (Bucher 2008). Power comes with
the ability to change, and when you have power, you are able to invoke change. For example,
the racial majority in the United States holds more economic, political, and social power than
other groups in the nation. The dominant group’s power in the United States allows the group
to define social and cultural norms as well as condemn or contest opposing views and
perspectives. This group has consistently argued the reality of “reverse racism” even though
racism is the practice of the dominant race benefitting off the oppression of others. Because
the dominant group has felt prejudice and discrimination by others, they want to control the
narrative and use their power to create a reality that further benefits their race by calling
thoughts and actions against the group as “reverse racism.”

However, when you are powerless, you may not have or be given the opportunity to participate
or have a voice. Think about when you are communicating with someone who has more power
than you. What do your tone, word choice, and body language project? So now imagine you are
the person in a position of power because of your age, gender, race, or other social category
what privilege does your position give you? Power implies authority, respect, significance, and
value so those of us who do not have a social position of power in a time of conflict may feel
and receive treatment that reinforces our lack of authority, disrespect, insignificance, and
devalued. Therefore, power reinforces social exclusion of some inflating cross-cultural conflict
(Ryle 2008). We must assess our cultural and social power as well as those of others we interact
with to develop an inclusive environment that builds on respect and understanding to deal with
conflicts more effectively.
Communication is essential when confronted with cross-cultural conflict (Bucher 2008).
Conflicts escalate from our inability to express our cultural realities or interact appropriately in
diverse settings. In order to relate to each other with empathy and understanding, we must
learn to employ use of positive words, phrases, and body language. Rather than engaging in
negative words to take sides (e.g., “Tell your side of the problem” or “How did that effect
you?”), use positive words that describe an experience or feeling. Use open-ended questions
that focus on the situation or concern (e.g., “Could you explain to be sure everyone
understands?” or “Explain how this is important and what needs to be different”) in your
communications with others (Ryle 2008). In addition, our body language expresses our
emotions and feelings to others. People are able to recognize sadness, fear, and disgust
through the expressions and movements we make. It is important to project expressions,
postures, and positions that are open and inviting even when we feel difference or
uncomfortable around others. Remember, words and body language have meaning and set the
tone or atmosphere in our interactions with others. The words and physical expressions we
choose either inflate or deescalate cross-cultural conflicts.
The act of reframing or rephrasing communications is also helpful in managing conflicts
between diverse people. Reframing requires active listening skills and patience to translate
negative and value-laden statements into neutral statements that focus on the actual issue or
concern. This form of transformative mediation integrates neutral language that focuses on
changing the message delivery, syntax or working, meaning, and context or situation to resolve
destructive conflict. For example, reframe “That’s a stupid idea” to “I hear you would like to
consider all possible options.” Conversely, reframe a direct verbal attack, “She lied! Why do you
want to be friends with her?” to “I’m hearing that confidentiality and trust are important to
you.” There are four steps to reframing: 1) actively listen to the statement; 2) identify the
feelings, message, and interests in communications; 3) remove toxic language; and 4) re-state
the issue or concern (Ryle 2008). These tips for resolving conflict helps people hear the
underlying interests and cultural realities.
