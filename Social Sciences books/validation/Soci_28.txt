Introduction
Welcome

Figure 1.0 Super, Natural British Columbia is one of the world’s premier tourism destinations. Together,
we’ll learn how the industry works and help prepare you for a career in tourism and hospitality.

Welcome! If you’re reading this book, then you likely have a strong interest in pursuing a career in BC’s tourism and
hospitality industry. Perhaps you are already working in the the industry and would like to enhance your skills. No matter
what your background, we’re happy to share this collaborative work that pulls together decades of industry experience
and academic know-how.

An Introduction to the Industry
No textbook could cover, in depth, the tourism industry in BC and the global context for its development. This textbook
is intended to be a stepping stone for further resources, and is written with a first year college and university audience
in mind.

Created through Collaboration
The book you’re reading was created through a collaborative process managed by LinkBC. It involved input from
educators at multiple institutions, industry leaders, employers, and past graduates of BC’s tourism and hospitality
management programs.

Introduction | vii

Chapter Organization
Each chapter is organized thematically, and moves from a global, to a national, to a provincial context. Some chapters
will be quite global in focus while others will concentrate primarily on British Columbia. Chapter content is based on
available data and research, and input from collaborators.

Additional Resources
Each chapter features “Spotlight On” text boxes that highlight an organization, business, or other key component of the
chapter’s theme. “Take a Closer Look” features encourage students to do further reading on particular subjects.
At the end of each chapter, key terms are presented in alphabetical order to help students gain confidence with
terminology; these terms are summarized in a Glossary at the end of the textbook.. These are followed by chapter
exercises and a case study for in-depth exploration of the subject matter.

What Is Tourism?
Before engaging in a study of tourism, let’s have a closer look at what this term means.

Definition of Tourism
There are a number of ways tourism can be defined, and for this reason, the United Nations World Tourism
Organization (UNWTO) embarked on a project from 2005 to 2007 to create a common glossary of terms for tourism.
It defines tourism as follows:
Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or
places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes. These people are called
visitors (which may be either tourists or excursionists; residents or non-residents) and tourism has to do with
their activities, some of which imply tourism expenditure (United Nations World Tourism Organization, 2008).
Using this definition, we can see that tourism is the movement of people for a number of purposes (whether business or
pleasure).

Definition of Tourist
Building on the definition of tourism, a commonly accepted description of a tourist is “someone who travels at least 80

Chapter 1. History and Overview | 1

km from his or her home for at least 24 hours, for business or leisure or other reasons” (LinkBC, 2008, p.8). The United
Nations World Tourism Organization (1995) helps us break down this definition further by stating tourists can be:
1. Domestic (residents of a given country travelling only within that country)
2. Inbound (non-residents travelling in a given country)
3. Outbound (residents of one country travelling in another country)
The scope of tourism, therefore, is broad and encompasses a number of activities.

Spotlight On: United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)
UNWTO is the United Nations agency responsible “for the promotion of responsible, sustainable and
universally accessible tourism” (UNWTO, 2014b). Its membership includes 156 countries and over 400
affiliates such as private companies and non-governmental organizations. It promotes tourism as a way
of developing communities while encouraging ethical behaviour to mitigate negative impacts. For more
information, visit the UNWTO website: http://www2.unwto.org/.

NAICS: The North American Industry Classification System
Given the sheer size of the tourism industry, it can be helpful to break it down into broad industry groups using a
common classification system. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was jointly created by
the Canadian, US, and Mexican governments to ensure common analysis across all three countries (British Columbia
Ministry of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training, 2013a). The tourism-related groupings created using NAICS are (in
alphabetical order):
1. Accommodation
2. Food and beverage services (commonly known as “F & B”)
3. Recreation and entertainment
4. Transportation
5. Travel services
These industry groups are based on the similarity of the “labour processes and inputs” used for each (Government
of Canada, 2013). For instance, the types of employees and resources required to run an accommodation business —
whether it be a hotel, motel, or even a campground — are quite similar. All these businesses need staff to check in guests,
provide housekeeping, employ maintenance workers, and provide a place for people to sleep. As such, they can be
grouped together under the heading of accommodation. The same is true of the other four groupings, and the rest of
this text explores these industry groups, and other aspects of tourism, in more detail.

The Hospitality Industry
When looking at tourism it’s important to consider the term hospitality. Some define hospitality as “the business of
helping people to feel welcome and relaxed and to enjoy themselves” (Discover Hospitality, 2015, ¶ 3). Simply put, the
hospitality industry is the combination of the accommodation and food and beverage groupings, collectively making
up the largest segment of the industry. You’ll learn more about accommodations and F & B in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4,
respectively.
Before we seek to understand the five industry groupings in more detail, it’s important to have an overview of the history
and impacts of tourism to date.

Global Overview
Origins of Tourism
Travel for leisure purposes has evolved from an experience reserved for very few people into something enjoyed by
Chapter 1. History and Overview | 3

many. Historically, the ability to travel was reserved for royalty and the upper classes. From ancient Roman times
through to the 17th century, young men of high standing were encouraged to travel through Europe on a “grand
tour” (Chaney, 2000). Through the Middle Ages, many societies encouraged the practice of religious pilgrimage, as
reflected in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and other literature.
The word hospitality predates the use of the word tourism, and first appeared in the 14th century. It is derived from the
Latin hospes, which encompasses the words guest, host, and foreigner (Latdict, 2014). The word tourist appeared in print
much later, in 1772 (Griffiths and Griffiths, 1772). William Theobald suggests that the word tour comes from Greek and
Latin words for circle and turn, and that tourism and tourist represent the activities of circling away from home, and
then returning (Theobald, 1998).

Tourism Becomes Business
Cox & Kings, the first known travel agency, was founded in 1758 when Richard Cox became official travel agent
of the British Royal Armed Forces (Cox & Kings, 2014). Almost 100 years later, in June 1841, Thomas Cook opened
the first leisure travel agency, designed to help Britons improve their lives by seeing the world and participating in
the temperance movement. In 1845, he ran his first commercial packaged tour, complete with cost-effective railway
tickets and a printed guide (Thomas Cook, 2014).
The continued popularity of rail travel and the emergence of the automobile presented additional milestones in the
development of tourism. In fact, a long journey taken by Karl Benz’s wife in 1886 served to kick off interest in auto travel
and helped to publicize his budding car company, which would one day become Mercedes Benz (Auer, 2006). We take a
closer look at the importance of car travel later this chapter, and of transportation to the tourism industry in Chapter 2.
Fast forward to 1952 with the first commercial air flights from London, England, to Johannesburg, South Africa, and
Colombo, Sri Lanka (Flightglobal, 2002) and the dawn of the jet age, which many herald as the start of the modern
tourism industry. The 1950s also saw the creation of Club Méditérannée (Gyr, 2010) and similar club holiday destinations,
the precursor of today’s all-inclusive resorts.
The decade that followed is considered to have been a significant period in tourism development, as more travel
companies came onto the scene, increasing competition for customers and moving toward “mass tourism, introducing
new destinations and modes of holidaying” (Gyr, 2010, p. 32).
Industry growth has been interrupted at several key points in history, including World War I, the Great Depression, and
World War II. At the start of this century, global events thrust international travel into decline including the September
11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center in New York City (known as 9/11), the war in Iraq, perceived threat of
future terrorist attacks, and health scares including SARS, BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and West Nile virus
(Government of Canada, 2006).
At the same time, the industry began a massive technological shift as increased internet use revolutionized travel
services. Through the 2000s, online travel bookings grew exponentially, and by 2014 global leader Expedia had expanded
to include brands such as Hotels.com, the Hotwire Group, trivago, and Expedia CruiseShip Centers, earning revenues of
over $4.7 million (Expedia Inc., 2013).
A more in-depth exploration of the impact of the online marketplace, and other trends in global tourism, is provided in
Chapter 14. But as you can already see, the impacts of the global tourism industry today are impressive and far reaching.
Let’s have a closer look at some of these outcomes.

4 | Chapter 1. History and Overview

Tourism Impacts
Tourism impacts can be grouped into three main categories: economic, social, and environmental. These impacts are
analyzed using data gathered by businesses, governments, and industry organizations.

Economic Impacts
According to a UNWTO report, in 2011, “international tourism receipts exceeded US$1 trillion for the first time”
(UNWTO, 2012). UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai stated this excess of $1 trillion was especially important news
given the global economic crisis of 2008, as tourism could help rebuild still-struggling economies, because it is a key
export and labour intensive (UNWTO, 2012).

Figure 1.2 Students visiting Vancouver for a conference

Tourism around the world is now worth over $1 trillion annually, and it’s a growing industry almost everywhere.
Regions with the highest growth in terms of tourism dollars earned are the Americas, Europe, Asia and the
Pacific, and Africa. Only the Middle East posted negative growth at the time of the report (UNWTO, 2012).
While North and South America are growing the fastest, Europe continues to lead the way in terms of overall percentage
of dollars earned (UNWTO, 2012):
• Europe (45%)
• Asia and the Pacific (28%)
• North and South America (19%)
• Middle East (4%)
Global industry growth and high receipts are expected to continue. In its August 2014 expenditure barometer, the
Chapter 1. History and Overview | 5

UNWTO found worldwide visitation had increased by 22 million people in the first half of the year over the previous
year, to reach 517 million visits (UNWTO, 2014a). As well, the UNWTO’s Tourism 2020 Vision predicts that international
arrivals will reach nearly 1.6 billion by 2020. Read more about the Tourism 2020 Vision: http://www.e-unwto.org/doi/
abs/10.18111/9789284403394

Social Impacts

Figure 1.3 First Nations art on display at Vancouver Island
University

In addition to the economic benefits of tourism development, positive social impacts include an increase in amenities
(e.g., parks, recreation facilities), investment in arts and culture, celebration of First Nations people, and community
pride. When developed conscientiously, tourism can, and does, contribute to a positive quality of life for residents.
However, as identified by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2003a), negative social impacts of tourism
can include:
• Change or loss of indigenous identity and values
• Culture clashes
• Physical causes of social stress (increased demand for resources)
• Ethical issues (such as an increase in sex tourism or the exploitation of child workers)
6 | Chapter 1. History and Overview

Some of these issues are explored in further detail in Chapter 12, which examines the development of Aboriginal tourism
in British Columbia.

Environmental Impacts
Tourism relies on, and greatly impacts, the natural environment in which it operates. Even though many areas of the
world are conserved in the form of parks and protected areas, tourism development can have severe negative impacts.
According to UNEP (2003b), these can include:
• Depletion of natural resources (water, forests, etc.)
• Pollution (air pollution, noise, sewage, waste and littering)
• Physical impacts (construction activities, marina development, trampling, loss of biodiversity)
The environmental impacts of tourism can reach outside local areas and have an effect on the global ecosystem. One
example is increased air travel, which is a major contributor to climate change. Chapter 10 looks at the environmental
impacts of tourism in more detail.
Whether positive or negative, tourism is a force for change around the world, and the industry is transforming at a
staggering rate. But before we delve deeper into our understanding of tourism, let’s take a look at the development of
the sector in our own backyard.

Canada Overview
Origins of Tourism in Canada
Tourism has long been a source of economic development for our country. Some argue that as early as 1534 the explorers
of the day, such as Jacques Cartier, were Canada’s first tourists (Dawson, 2004), but most agree the major developments
in Canada’s tourism industry followed milestones in the transportation sector: by rail, by car, and eventually, in the skies.

Chapter 1. History and Overview | 7

Railway Travel: The Ties That Bind

Figure 1.4 Canadian Pacific 4-4-0 A-2-m No 136

The dawn of the railway age in Canada came midway through the 19th century. The first railway was launched in 1836
(Library and Archives Canada, n.d.), and by the onset of World War I in 1914, four railways dominated the Canadian
landscape: Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), Canadian Northern Railway (CNOR), the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), and
the Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP). Unfortunately, their rapid expansion soon brought the last three into near bankruptcy
(Library and Archives Canada, n.d.).
In 1923, these three rail companies were amalgamated into the Canadian National Railway (CNR), and together with
the CPR, these trans-continentals dominated the Canadian travel landscape until other forms of transportation became
more popular. In 1978, with declining interest in rail travel, the CPR and CNR were forced to combine their passenger
services to form VIA Rail (Library and Archives Canada, n.d.).

The Rise of the Automobile
The rising popularity of car travel was partially to blame for the decline in rail travel, although it took time to develop.
When the first cross-country road trip took place in 1912, there were only 16 kilometres of paved road across
Canada (MacEachern, 2012). Cars were initially considered a nuisance, and the National Parks Branch banned entry to
automobiles, but later slowly began to embrace them. By the 1930s, some parks, such as Cape Breton Highlands National
Park, were actually created to provide visitors with scenic drives (MacEachern, 2012).
It would take decades before a coast-to-coast highway was created, with the Trans-Canada Highway officially opening
in Revelstoke in 1962. When it was fully completed in 1970, it was the longest national highway in the world, spanning
one-fifth of the globe (MacEachern, 2012).

8 | Chapter 1. History and Overview

Early Tourism Promotion
As early as 1892, enterprising Canadians like the Brewsters became the country’s first tour operators, leading guests
through areas such as Banff National Park (Brewster Travel Canada, 2014). Communities across Canada developed
their own marketing strategies as transportation development took hold. For instance, the town of Maisonneuve in
Quebec launched a campaign from 1907 to 1915 calling itself “Le Pittsburg du Canada.” And by 1935 Quebec was spending
$250,000 promoting tourism, with Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia also enjoying established provincial
tourism bureaus (Dawson, 2004).

National Airlines
Our national airline, Air Canada, was formed in 1937 as Trans-Canada Air Lines. In many ways, Air Canada was a world
leader in passenger aviation, introducing the world’s first computerized reservations system in 1963 (Globe and Mail,
2014). Through the 1950s and 1960s, reduced airfares saw increased mass travel. Competitors including Canadian Pacific
(which became Canadian Airlines in 1987) began to launch international flights during this time to Australia, Japan, and
South America (Canadian Geographic, 2000). By 2000, Air Canada was facing financial peril and forced to restructure.
A numbered company, owned in part by Air Canada, purchased 82% of Canadian Airline’s shares, with the result of Air
Canada becoming the country’s only national airline (Canadian Geographic, 2000).

Parks and Protected Areas
A look at the evolution of tourism in Canada would be incomplete without a quick study of our national parks and
protected areas. The official conserving of our natural spaces began around the same time as the railway boom, and in
1885 Banff was established as Canada’s first national park. By 1911, the Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act created
the Dominion Parks Branch, the first of its kind in the world (Shoalts, 2011).
The systemic conservation and celebration of Canada’s parks over the next century would help shape Canada’s identity,
both at home and abroad. Through the 1930s, conservation officers and interpreters were hired to enhance visitor
experiences. By 1970, the National Park System Plan divided Canada into 39 regions, with the goal of preserving
each distinct ecosystem for future generations. In 1987, the country’s first national marine park was established in
Ontario, and in the 20 years that followed, 10 new national parks and marine conservation areas were created
(Shoalts, 2011).
The role of parks and protected areas in tourism is explored in greater detail in Chapter 5 (recreation) and Chapter 10
(environmental stewardship).

Global Shock and Industry Decline
As with the global industry, Canada’s tourism industry was impacted by world events such as the Great Depression and
the World Wars.
More recently, global events such as 9/11, the SARS outbreak, and the war in Iraq took their toll on tourism receipts.
Worldwide arrivals to Canada dropped 1% to 694 million in 2003, after three years of stagnant growth. In 2005, spending
reached $61.4 billion with domestic travel accounting for 71% (Government of Canada, 2006).

Chapter 1. History and Overview | 9

Tourism in Canada Today
In 2011, tourism created $78.8 billion in total economic activity and 603,400 jobs. Tourism accounted for more of
Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) than agriculture, forestry, and fisheries combined (Tourism Industry Association
of Canada, 2014).

Spotlight On: The Tourism Industry Association of Canada (TIAC)
Founded in 1930 and based in Ottawa, the Tourism Industry Association of Canada (TIAC) is the national
private-sector advocate for the industry. Its goal is to support policies and programs that help the industry
grow, while representing over 400 members including airports, concert halls, festivals and events, travel
services providers, and businesses of all sizes. For more information, visit the Tourism Industry Association
of Canada’s website: http://tiac.travel/About.html

Unfortunately, while overall receipts from tourism appear healthy, and globally the industry is growing, according to
a recent report, Canada’s historic reliance on the US market (which traditionally accounts for 75% of our market) is
troubling. Because three out of every four international visitors to Canada originates in the United States, the 55%
decline in that market since 2000 is being very strongly felt here. Many feel the decline in American visitors to Canada
can be attributed to tighter passport and border regulations, the economic downturn (including the 2008 global
economic crisis), and a stronger Canadian dollar (TIAC, 2014).
Despite disappointing numbers from the United States, Canada continues to see strong visitation from the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, and China. In 2011, we welcomed 3,180,262 tourists from our top 15 inbound
countries (excluding the United States). Canadians travelling domestically accounted for 80% of tourism revenues in the
country, and TIAC suggested that a focus on rebounding US visitation would help grow the industry (TIAC, 2014).

Spotlight On: The Canadian Tourism Commission
Housed in Vancouver, Destination Canada, previously the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC), is
responsible for promoting Canada in several foreign markets: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India,
Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It works with private companies,
travel services providers, meeting professionals, and government organizations to help leverage Canada’s
tourism brand, Canada. Keep Exploring. It also conducts research and has a significant image library
(Canadian Tourism Commission, 2014). For more information, visit Destination Canada website:
http://en.destinationcanada.com/about-ctc.

As organizations like TIAC work to confront barriers to travel, the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) is active abroad,
encouraging more visitors to explore our country. In Chapter 8, we’ll delve more into the challenges and triumphs of
selling tourism at home and abroad.
The great news for British Columbia is that once in Canada, most international visitors tend to remain in the province
they landed in, and BC is one of three provinces that receives the bulk of this traffic (TIAC, 2012). In fact, BC’s tourism
10 | Chapter 1. History and Overview

industry is one of the healthiest in Canada today. Let’s have a look at how our provincial industry was established and
where it stands now.

British Columbia Overview
Origins of Tourism in BC
As with the history of tourism in Canada, it’s often stated that the first tourists to BC were explorers. In 1778, Captain
James Cook touched down on Vancouver Island, followed by James Douglas in 1842, a British agent who had been
sent to find new headquarters for the Hudson’s Bay Company, ultimately choosing Victoria. Through the 1860s, BC’s
gold rush attracted prospectors from around the world, with towns and economies springing up along the trail
(PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009).

Railway Travel: Full Steam Ahead!
The development of BC’s tourism industry began in earnest in the late 1800s when the CPR built accommodation
properties along itsnewly completed trans-Canada route, capturing revenues from overnight stays to help alleviate their
increasing corporate debt. Following the 1886 construction of small lodges at stops in Field, Rogers Pass, and Fraser
Canyon, the CPR opened the Hotel Vancouver in May 1887 (Dawson, 2004).
As opposed to Atlantic Canada, where tourism promotion centred around attracting hunters and fishermen for a
temporary infusion of cash, in British Columbia tourism was seen as a way to lure farmers and settlers to stay in the new
province. Industry associations began to form quickly: the Tourist Association of Victoria (TAV) in February 1902, and
the Vancouver Tourist Association in June of the same year (Dawson, 2004).
Many of the campaigns struck by these and other organizations between 1890 and 1930 centred on the province’s
natural assets, as people sought to escape modern convenience and enjoy the environment. A collaborative group called
the Pacific Northwest Travel Association (BC, Washington, and Oregon) promoted “The Pacific Northwest: The World’s
Greatest Out of Doors,” calling BC “The Switzerland of North America.” Promotions like these seemed to have had an
effect: in 1928, over 370,000 tourists visited Victoria, spending over $3.5 million (Dawson, 2004).

The Great Depression and World War II
As the world’s economy was sent into peril during the Great Depression in the 1930s, tourism was seen as an economic
solution. A newly renamed Greater Victoria Publicity Bureau touted a “100 for 1” multiplier effect of tourism spending,
with visitor revenues accounting for around 13.5% of BC’s income in 1930. By 1935, an organization known as the TTDA
(Tourist Trade Development Association of Victoria and Vancouver Island) looked to create a more stable industry
through strategies to increase visitors’ length of stay (Dawson, 2004).
In 1937, the provincial Bureau of Industrial and Tourist Development (BITD) was formed through special legislation with
a goal of increasing tourist traffic. By 1938, the organization changed its name to the British Columbia Government
Travel Bureau (BCGTB) and was granted a budget increase to $105,000. This was soon followed by an expansion of the
BC Tourist Council designed to solicit input from across the province. And in 1939, Vancouver welcomed the King and
Chapter 1. History and Overview | 11

Queen of England and celebrated the opening of the Lions Gate Bridge, activities that reportedly bolstered tourism
numbers (Dawson, 2004).
The December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii had negative repercussions for tourism on the Pacific
Rim and was responsible for an era of decreased visitation to British Columbia, despite attempts by some to market the
region as exciting. From 1939 to 1943, US visits to Vancouver (measured at the border) dropped from over 307,000 to
approximately 183,600. Just two years later, however, that number jumped to 369,250, the result of campaigns like the
1943 initiative aimed at Americans that marketed BC as “comrades in war” (Dawson, 2004).

Post-War Rebound
We, with all due modesty, cannot help but claim that we are entering British Columbia’s half-century, and cannot
help but observe that B.C. also stands for BOOM COUNTRY. – Phil Gagliardi, BC Minister of Highways, 1955
(Dawson, 2004, p.190)
A burst of post-war spending began in 1946, and although short-lived, was supported by steady government investment
in marketing throughout the 1950s. As tourism grew in BC, however, so did competition for US dollars from Mexico, the
Caribbean, and Europe. The decade that followed saw an emphasis on promoting BC’s history, its “Britishness,” and a
commodification of Aboriginal culture. The BCGTB began marketing efforts to extend the travel season, encouraging
travel in September, prime fishing season. It also tried to push visitors to specific areas, including the Lower Fraser
Valley, the Okanagan-Fraser Canyon Loop, and the Kamloops-Cariboo region (Dawson, 2004).

12 | Chapter 1. History and Overview

In 1954, Vancouver hosted the British Empire Games, investing in the construction of Empire Stadium. A few years
later, an increased emphasis on events and convention business saw the Greater Vancouver Tourist Association change
its name in 1962 to the Greater Vancouver Visitors and Convention Bureau (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009).
The ski industry was also on the rise: in 1961, the lodge and chairlift on Tod Mountain (now Sun Peaks) opened, and
Whistler followed suit five years later (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009). Ski partners became pioneers of collaborative
marketing in the province with the foundation of the Ski Marketing Advisory Committee (SMAC) supported by Tod
Mountain and Big White, evolving into today’s Canada’s West Ski Area Association (Magnes, 2010). This pioneer spirit was
evident across the ski sector: the entire sport of heliskiing was invented by Hans Gosmer of BC’s Canadian Mountain
Holidays, and today the province holds 90% of the world’s heliskiing market share (McLeish, 2014).
The concept of collaboration extended throughout the province as innovative funding structures saw the cost of
marketing programs shared between government and industry in BC. These programs were distributed through regional
channels (originally eight regions in the province), and considered “the most constructive and forward looking plan of
its kind in Canada” (Dawson 2004, p.194).
Tourism in BC continued to grow through the 1970s. In 1971, the Hotel Room Tax Act was introduced, allowing for
a 5% tax to be collected on room nights with the funds collected to be put toward marketing and development.
By 1978, construction had begun on Whistler Village, with Blackcomb Mountain opening two years later
(PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009). Funding programs in the late 1970s and early 1980s such as the Canada BC Tourism
Agreement (CBCTA) and Travel Industry Development Subsidiary Agreement (TIDSA) allowed communities to invest in
projects that would make them more attractive tourism destinations. In the mountain community of Kimberley, for
instance, the following improvements were implemented through a $3.1 million forgivable loan: a new road to the ski
resort, a covered tennis court, a mountain lodge, an alpine slide, and nine more holes for the golf course (e-Know, 2011).
Around the same time, the “Super, Natural British Columbia” brand was introduced, and a formal bid was approved for
Vancouver to host a fair then known as Transpo 86 (later Expo 86). Tourism in the province was about to truly take off.

Expo 86 and Beyond
By the time the world fair Expo 86 came to a close in October 1986, it had played host to 20,111,578 guests. Infrastructure
developments, including rapid rail, airport improvements, a new trade and convention centre at Canada Place (with
a cruise ship terminal), and hotel construction, had positioned the city and the province for further growth
(PricewaterhouseCooopers, 2009). The construction and opening of the Coquihalla Highway through to 1990 enhanced
the travel experience and reduced travel times to vast sections of the province (Magnes, 2010).

Take a Closer Look: The Value of Tourism
Tourism Vancouver Island, with the support of many partners, has created a website that directly addresses
the value of tourism in the region. The site looks at the economics of tourism, social benefits of tourism, and
a “what’s your role?” feature that helps users understand where they fit in. Explore the Tourism Vancouver
Island website: http://valueoftourism.ca/.

By 2000, Vancouver International Airport (YVR) was named number one in the world by the International Air Transport

Chapter 1. History and Overview | 13

Association’s survey of international passengers. Five years later, the airport welcomed a record 16.4 million passengers
(PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009).

Figure 1.6 Canada vs Switzerland

In 2003, the International Olympic Committee named Vancouver/Whistler as the host city for the 2010 Olympic and
Paralympic Winter Games. Infrastructure development followed, including the expansion of the Sea-to-Sky Highway,
the creation of Vancouver Convention Centre West, and the construction of the Canada Line, a rapid transport line
connecting the airport with the city’s downtown.
As BC prepared to host the Games, its international reputation continued to grow. Vancouver was voted “Best City
in the Americas” by Condé Nast Traveller magazine three years in a row. Kelowna was named “Best Canadian Golf
City” by Canada’s largest golf magazine, and BC was named the “Best Golf Destination in North America” by the
International Association of Golf Tour Operators. Kamloops, known as Canada’s Tournament City, hosted over 100
sports tournaments that same year, and nearby Sun Peaks Resort was named the “Best Family Resort in North America”
by the Great Skiing and Snowboarding Guide in 2008 (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009).
By the time the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place, over 80 participating countries, 6,000
athletes, and 3 billion viewers put British Columbia on centre stage.

Spotlight On: Destination British Columbia
Destination BC is a Crown corporation founded in November 2012 by the Government of British Columbia.
Its mandate includes marketing the province as a tourist destination (at home and around the world),
promoting the development and growth of the industry, providing advice and recommendations to the

14 | Chapter 1. History and Overview

tourism minister on related matters, and enhancing public awareness of tourism and its economic value to
British Columbia (Province of British Columbia, 2013b).

Tourism in BC Today
Building on the momentum generated by hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, tourism in BC remains big business.
In 2012, the industry generated $13.5 billion in revenue.
The provincial industry is made up of over 18,000 businesses, the majority of which are SMEs (small to medium
enterprises), and together they employ approximately 127,300 people (Tourism Industry Association of BC, 2014). It may
surprise you to learn that in British Columbia, tourism provides more jobs than high tech, oil and gas, mining, and
forestry (Porges, 2014).

Spotlight On: The Tourism Industry Association of BC
Founded in 1993 as the Council of Tourism Associations, today the Tourism Industry Association
of BC (TIABC) is a not-for-profit trade association comprising members from private sector tourism
businesses, industry associations, and destination marketing organizations (DMOs). Its goal is to ensure
the best working environment for a competitive tourism industry. It hosts industry networking events and
engages in advocacy efforts as “the voice of the BC tourism industry.” Students are encouraged to join
TIABC to take advantage of their connections and receive a discount at numerous industry events. For
more information, visit the Tourism Industry Association of BC’s website: http://www.tiabc.ca/studentmembership

One of the challenges for BC’s tourism industry, it has long been argued, is fragmentation. Back in September 1933,
an article in the Victoria Daily Times argued for more coordination across organizations in order to capitalize on what
they saw as Canada’s “largest dividend payer” (Dawson, 2004). Today, more than 80 years later, you will often hear BC
tourism professionals say the same thing.
On the other hand, some experts believe that the industry is simply a model of diversity, acknowledging that tourism is
a compilation of a multitude of businesses, services, organizations, and communities. They see the ways in which these
components are working together toward success, rather than focusing on friction between the groups.
Many communities are placing a renewed focus on educating the general public and other businesses about the value of
tourism and the ways in which stakeholders work together. The following case study highlights this in more detail:

Throughout the rest of this textbook, you’ll have a chance to learn more about the history and current outlook
for tourism in BC, with in-depth coverage of some of the triumphs and challenges we’ve faced as an industry. You
will also learn about the Canadian and global contexts of the tourism industry’s development.

Conclusion
As we’ve seen in this chapter, tourism is a complex set of industries including accommodation, recreation
and entertainment, food and beverage services, transportation, and travel services. It encompasses domestic, inbound,
and outbound travel for business, leisure, or other purposes. And because of this large scope, tourism development
requires participation from all walks of life, including private business, governmental agencies, educational institutions,
communities, and citizens.
Recognizing the diverse nature of the industry and the significant contributions tourism makes toward economic and
social value for British Columbians is important. There remains a great deal of work to better educate members of the
tourism industry, other sectors, and the public about the ways tourism contributes to our province.
Given this opportunity for greater awareness, it is hoped that students like you will help share this information as
you learn more about the sector. So let’s begin our exploration in Chapter 2 with a closer look at a critical sector:
transportation.

Chapter 2. Transportation
MORGAN WESTCOTT

Learning Objectives

• Understand the role of transportation in the tourism industry
• Recognize milestones in the development of the air industry and explain how profitability is measured in
this sector
• Report on the historic importance of rail travel and challenges to rail operations today
• Describe water-based transportation segments including cruise travel and passenger ferries
• Recognize the importance of transportation infrastructure in tourism destinations
• Specify elements of sightseeing transportation, and explain current issues regarding rental vehicles and
taxis
• Identify and relate industry trends and issues including fuel costs, environmental impacts, and changing
weather

Overview
The transportation sector is vital to the success of our industry. Put simply, if we can’t move people from place to place
— whether by air, sea, or land — we don’t have an industry. This chapter takes a broad approach, covering each segment
of the transportation sector globally, nationally, and at home in British Columbia.
Let’s start our review by taking a look at the airline industry.

Air
According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in 2014, airlines transported 3.3 billion people across
a network of almost 50,000 routes generating 58 million jobs and $2.4 trillion in business activity (International Air
Transport Association, 2014a).

Spotlight On: International Air Transport Association
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the trade association for the world’s airlines,
representing around 240 airlines or 84% of total air traffic. It supports many areas of aviation activity

22 | Chapter 2. Transportation

and helps formulate industry policy on critical aviation issues (IATA, 2014b). For more information, visit
the International Air Transport Association website: http://www.iata.org

The first commercial (paid) passenger flight took place in Florida on New Year’s Day 1914 as a single person was
transported across Tampa Bay (IATA 2014a). There have been a number of international aviation milestones since that
flight, as illustrated in Table 2.1.

Rules and Regulations
Aviation is a highly regulated industry as it crosses many government jurisdictions. This section explores key airline
regulations in more detail.

Chapter 2. Transportation | 23

Open Skies

Figure 2.1 Open skies

The term open skies refers to policies that allow national airlines to fly to, and above, other countries. These policies lift
restrictions where countries have good relationships, freeing up the travel of passengers and goods.

Take a Closer Look: The 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation
This document contains the original statements from the convention that created the airline industry as
we know it, providing a preamble statement as well as detailed articles pertaining to a range of issues
from cabotage to pilotless aircraft. Read the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation [PDF]:
www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_orig.pdf

Canada’s approach to open skies is the Blue Sky Policy, first implemented in 2006. The National Airlines Council of
Canada (NACC) and Canadian Airports Council (CAC) support the Blue Sky Policy.
While opening up air transport agreements (ATAs) with other jurisdictions is important, the Canadian government
doesn’t provide blanket arrangements, instead negotiating “when it is in Canada’s overall interest to do so” (Government
of Canada, 2014a). Some suggest the government should be more liberal with air access so more competitors can enter
the market, potentially attracting more visitors to the country (Gill and Raynor, 2003).

Taxes and Fees
According to a 2012 Senate study on issues related to the Canadian airline industry, Canadian travellers are being
grounded by airline fees, fuel surcharges, security taxes, airport improvement fees, and other additional costs. Airports
are charged rental fees by the Canadian government ($4.8 billion from 1992 to 2004), which they pass on to the airlines,
24 | Chapter 2. Transportation

who in turn transfer the costs to travellers. Some think eliminating rental fees would make Canadian airports more
competitive, and view rental and other fees as the reason 5 million Canadians went south of the border for flights in
2013, where passenger fees are 230% lower than in Canada (Hermiston and Steele, 2014).

Profitability
Running an airline is like having a baby: fun to conceive, but hell to deliver. – C. E. Woolman, principal founder of
Delta Air Lines (The Economist, 2011).
As the quote above suggests, airlines are faced with many challenges. In addition to operating in a strict regulatory
environment, airlines yield extremely small profit margins. In 2013 the industry accumulated $10.6 billion worldwide in
revenues, although global profit margins were just 1.5% (IATA, 2014a). To put that into perspective, while the average
airline earned 1.5%, Apple’s profit margins were almost 14 times that at 20.15% (YCharts, 2014).

Passenger Load Factor
Key to airline profitability is passenger load factor, which relates how efficiently planes are being used. Load factor for
a single flight can be determined by dividing the number of passengers by the number of seats.

Figure 2.2 An Airbus 380-800 takes off

Passenger load factors in the airline industry reached a record high in 2013, at just under 80%, which was attributed to
increased volumes and strong capacity management in key sectors (IATA, 2104a). One way of increasing capacity is by
using larger aircraft. For instance, the introduction of the Airbus A380 model has allowed up to 40% more capacity per
flight, carrying up to 525 passengers in a three-class configuration, and up to 853 in a single-class configuration (Airbus,
2014).

Low-Cost Carriers
Another key factor in profitability is the airline’s business model. In 1971, Southwest Airlines became the first lowChapter 2. Transportation | 25

cost carrier (LCC), revolutionizing the industry. The LCC model involved charging for all extras such as reserved
seating, baggage, and on-board service, and cutting costs by offering less legroom and using non-unionized workforces.
Typically, an LCC has to run with 90% full planes to break even (Owram, 2014). The high-volume, lower-service system
is what we have become used to today, but at the time it was introduced, it was groundbreaking.

Ancillary Revenues
The LCC model, combined with tight margins, led to today’s climate where passengers are charged for value-added
services such as meals, headsets, blankets, seat selection, and bag checking. These are known in the industry as
ancillary revenues. Profits from these extras rose from $36 billion in 2012 to $42 billion in 2013, or more than $13 a
passenger. An average net profit of only $3.39 per passenger was retained by airlines (IATA, 2014a).
As you can see, airlines must strive to maintain profitability, despite thin margins, in an environment with heavy
government regulation. But at the same time, they must be responsible for the safety of their passengers.

Air Safety and Security
IATA encourages airlines to view safety from a number of points, including reducing operational risks such as plane
crashes, by running safety audit programs. They also advocate for improved infrastructure such as runway upgrades and
training for pilots and other crew. Finally, they strive to understand emerging safety issues, including the outsourcing of
operations to third-party companies (IATA, 2014a).
In terms of security, coordination between programs such as the Interpol Stolen and Lost Travel Documents initiative
and other databases is critical (IATA, 2014a). As reservations and management systems become increasingly
computerized, cyber-security becomes a top concern for airlines, who must protect IT (information technology)
because their databases contain information about flights and passengers’ personal information. Unruly passengers are
also a cause of concern, with over 8,000 incidents reported worldwide every year (IATA, 2014a).
Now that we have a better sense of the complexities of the industry, let’s take a closer look at air travel in Canada and
the regional air industry.

26 | Chapter 2. Transportation

Canada’s Air Industry

Figure 2.3 An Air Canada Jazz plane readies for takeoff

In 1937, Trans-Canada Air Lines (later to become Air Canada) was launched with two passenger planes and one mail
plane. By the 1950s, Canadian Pacific Airlines (CP Air) entered the marketplace, and an economic boom led to more
affordable tickets. Around this time CP Air (which became Canadian Airlines in 1987) launched flights to Australia, Japan,
and South America (Canadian Geographic, 2000). In 2001, Canadian Airlines International was acquired by Air Canada
(Aviation Safety Network, 2012).
In 1996, the marketplace changed drastically with the entry of an Alberta-based LCC called WestJet. By 2014, WestJet
had grown to become Canada’s second major airline with more than 9,700 staff flying to 88 destinations across domestic
and international networks (WestJet, 2014).
As it grew, WestJet began to offer services such as premium economy class and a frequent-flyer program, launched
a regional carrier, and introduced transatlantic flights with service to Dublin, Ireland, evolving away from the LCC model
(Owram, 2014). With those changes, and in the absence of a true low-cost carrier, in 2014, some other companies, such
as Canada Jetlines and JetNaked, sought to raise upward of $50 million to bring their airlines to market.
However, outside of Air Canada and WestJet, airlines in Canada have found it very challenging to survive, and some
examples of LCC startups like Harmony Airways and Jetsgo have fallen by the wayside.

Challenges to Canada’s Air Industry
When looking at these failed airlines in Canada, three key challenges to success can be identified (Owram, 2014):
1. Canada’s large geographical size and sparse population mean relatively low demand for flights.
2. Canada’s higher taxes and fees compared with other jurisdictions (such as the United States) make pricing less
competitive.
Chapter 2. Transportation | 27

3. Canada’s two dominant airlines are able to price new entrants out of the market.
In addition to these factors, the European debt crisis, a slow US economic recovery, more cautious spending by
Canadians, and fuel price increases led to a $900 million industry loss in 2011 (Conference Board of Canada, 2012) prior
to the industry returning to profitability in 2013.

Take a Closer Look: One Size Doesn’t Fit All
In 2013, a special report to the Canadian Senate explored the concept that one size doesn’t fit all when it
comes to competitiveness in the country’s airline industry. The report contains general observations about
the industry as well as a number of recommendations to stakeholders, including airport managers. Read
the report: “One Size Doesn’t Fit All: the Future Growth and Competitiveness of Canadian Air Travel” [PDF]:
www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/411/trcm/rep/rep08apr13-e.pdf

Today, the Canadian airline industry directly employs roughly 141,000 people and is worth $34.9 billion in gross domestic
product. It supports 330 jobs for every 100,000 passengers and contributes over $12 billion to federal and provincial
treasuries, including over $7 billion in taxes (Gill and Raynor, 2013).
Let’s now turn our attention to the regional air market, focusing on British Columbia.

Regional Airlines
Transportation in BC has always been difficult: incomplete road systems and rugged terrain historically made travel
between communities almost impossible. In 1927, a number of businessmen promised to change all that when they
opened British Columbia Airways in Victoria with the purchase of a commercial airliner (Canadian Museum of Flight,
2014).
As commercial flying became more popular, and the province grew, regional airports started to spring up around BC
as a means of delivering surveying equipment, forestry supplies, and workers. Many of these airports were legacies
of Canada’s strategic position for the military. Fort Nelson’s airport, for instance, was established so the US Air Force
could fuel aircraft bound for Russia in World War II (Northern Rockies Regional Airport, 2014).
In 1994, Transport Canada transferred all 150 airports under its control to local authorities under the National Airports
Policy (NAP). This policy is considered to have been a turning point in the privatization of the airline industry in
Canada. A 2004 study showed that after 10 years, 48% of these airports were not able to cover annual costs of operation,
leading to concerns about the viability of small local airports in particular (InterVISTAS, 2005).
In 2012, the BC government released its aviation strategy, entitled Connecting with the World, which acknowledged
the economic challenges for airports large and small. These range from Vancouver International Airport (YVR), which
supports more than 61,000 jobs and creates more than $11 billion in economic activity each year, through to regional and
local airports. The strategy outlined a framework to remove barriers to aviation growth including potentially eliminating
the two-cent-per-litre International Aviation Fuel Tax (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure,
2012).
Given a highly complex regulatory environment, razor-thin profit margins, and intense competition, the airline industry

28 | Chapter 2. Transportation

is constantly changing and evolving at global, national, and regional levels. But one thing is certain: air travel is here to
stay.
On the other hand, the rail industry has been faced with significant declines since air travel became accessible to the
masses. Let’s learn more about this sector.

Rail

Figure 2.4 CPR Mount Steven House in Field, BC
(1909)

In Chapter 1, we looked at the historic significance of railways as they laid the foundation for the modern tourism
industry. That’s because in many places, including Canada and British Columbia, trains were an unprecedented way
to move people across vast expanses of land. With the Canadian Pacific company opening up hotels in major
cities, BC’s hospitality sector was born and a golden age of rail travel emerged.

Profitability
However, starting in the 1940s and 1950s, the passenger rail industry began to decline sharply. In 1945, Canadian railways
carried 55.4 million passengers, but just 10 years later passenger traffic had dropped to 27.2 million. The creation of VIA
Rail in 1977 as a Canadian Crown corporation was an attempt by the government to ensure rail travel did not disappear,
but in the years since its founding VIA has struggled, relying heavily on federal subsidies in order to continue operations.
Between 1989 and 1990, VIA lost over 45% of its ridership when it cut unprofitable routes, focusing on areas with
better potential for revenue and passenger volumes. From there, annual ridership has stabilized at around 3.5 million to
4.0 million passengers per year, slowly increasing throughout the 1990s and 2000s (Dupuis, 2011).
Chapter 2. Transportation | 29

Despite this slight recovery, there are a number of challenges for passenger rail in Canada, which will likely require
continued government support to survive. Three key challenges to a successful passenger rail industry are:
1. Passenger rail must negotiate with freight for right-of-use of tracks.
2. There is limited potential of routes (with the highest volume existing in the Quebec-Windsor corridor).
3. Fixed-cost equipment is aging out, requiring replacement or upgrading.
High-speed rail seems like an attractive option, but would be expensive to construct as existing tracks aren’t suitable
for the reasons given above. It’s also unlikely to provide high enough returns to private investors (Dupuis, 2011). This
means the Canadian government would have to invest heavily in a rapid rail project for it to proceed. As of 2014, no such
investment was planned.

Spotlight On: Rocky Mountaineer Rail Tours
Founded in 1990, Rocky Mountaineer offers three train journeys through BC and Alberta to Banff, Lake
Louise, Jasper, and Calgary, and one train excursion from Vancouver to Whistler. In 2013, Rocky Mountaineer
introduced Coastal Passage, a new route connecting Seattle to the Canadian Rockies that can be added to
any two-day or more rail journey (Rocky Mountaineer, 2014). For more information, please visit the Rocky
Mountaineer website: http://www.rockymountaineer.com

While the industry overall has been in a decline, touring companies like Rocky Mountaineer have found a financially
successful model by shifting the focus from transportation to the sightseeing experience. The company has weathered
financial storms by refusing to discount their luxury product, instead focusing on the unique experiences. The long
planning cycle for scenic rail packages has helped the company stand their ground in terms of pricing (Cubbon, 2010).

Rail Safety
In Canada, rail safety is governed by the Railway Safety Act, which ensures safe railway operation and amends other
laws that relate to rail safety (Government of Canada, 2014b). The Act is overseen by the Minister of Transport. It covers
grade crossings, mining and construction near railways, operating certifications, financial penalties for infractions, and
safety management.
The Act was revised in late 2014 in response to the massive rail accident in July 2013 in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec.
A runaway oil train exploded, killing 47 people, and subsequently MM&A Railway and three employees, including the
train’s engineer, were charged with criminal negligence (CBC News, 2014).
In addition to freight management issues, a key rail safety concern is that of crossings. As recently as April 2014,
Transport Canada had to issue orders for improved safety measures at crossings in suburban Ottawa after a signal
malfunctioned in the area (CTV News, 2014a). According to Operation Lifesaver Canada (2014), in 2011, there were
169 crossing collisions across Canada, with 25 fatalities and 21 serious injuries. In general, however, Canada’s 73,000
kilometres of railway tracks safely transport both people and goods. And while railways in Canada, and elsewhere,
are being forced to innovate, companies like Rocky Mountaineer (see Spotlight On above) give the industry glimmers of
hope.

30 | Chapter 2. Transportation

The rail industry shares some common history with the cruise sector. Let’s now turn our focus to the water and learn
about the evolution of travel on the high seas.

Water

Figure 2.5 A cruise ship at sunset at Ogden Point, Victoria

Travel by water is as old as civilization itself. However, the industry as we know it began when Thomas Newcomen
invented the steam engine in 1712. The first crossing of the Atlantic by steam engine took place in 1819 aboard the SS
Savannah, landing in Liverpool, England, after 29 days at sea. Forty years later, White Star Lines began building ocean
liners including the Olympic-class ships (the Olympic, Britannic, and Titanic), expanding on previously utilitarian models
by adding luxurious amenities (Briggs, 2008).
A boom in passenger ship travel toward the end of the 1800s was aided by a growing influx of immigrants from Europe
to America, while more affluent passengers travelled by steamship for pleasure or business. The industry grew over
time but, like rail travel, began to decline after the arrival of airlines. Shipping companies were forced to change their
business model from pure transportation to “an experience,” and the modern cruise industry was born.

The Cruise Sector
We’ve come a long way since the Olympic class of steamship. Today, the world’s largest cruise ship, MS Oasis of the
Seas, has an outdoor park with 12,000 plants, an 82-foot zip wire, and a high-diving performance venue. It’s 20 storeys
tall and can hold 5,400 passengers and a crew of up to 2,394 (Magrath, 2014). A crew on a cruise ship will include the
captain, the chief officer (in charge of training and maintenance), staff captain, chief engineer, chief medical officer, and
chief radio officer (communication, radar, and weather monitoring).

Chapter 2. Transportation | 31

Spotlight On: Cruise Lines International Association
Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) is the world’s largest cruise industry trade association with
representation in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia. CLIA represents the interests of
cruise lines and travel agents in the development of policy. CLIA is also engaged in travel agent training,
research, and marketing communications (CLIA, 2014). For more information on CLIA, the cruise industry,
and member cruise lines and travel agencies, visit the Cruise Lines International Association website:
www.cruising.org

Cruising the World
According to CLIA, 21.7 million passengers were expected to travel worldwide on 63 member lines in 2014. Given
increased demand, 24 new ships were expected in 2014-15, adding a total capacity of over 37,000 passengers.
Over 55% of the world’s cruise passengers are from North America, and the leading destinations (based on ship
deployments), according to CLIA, are:
• The Caribbean (37%)
• The Mediterranean (19%)
• Northern Europe (11%)
• Australia/New Zealand (6%)
• Alaska (5%)
• Asia (4%)
• South America (3%)

River Cruising
While mass cruises to destinations like the Caribbean remain incredibly popular, river cruises are emerging as another
strong segment of the industry. The key differences between river cruises and ocean cruises are (Hill, 2013):
1. River cruise ships are smaller (400 feet long by 40 feet wide on average) and can navigate narrow passages.
2. River cruises carry fewer passengers (about 10% of the average cruise, or 200 passengers total).
3. Beer, wine, and high-end cuisine are generally offered in the standard package.
The price point for river cruises is around the same as ocean trips, with the typical cost ranging from $2,000 to $4,000,
depending on the itinerary, accommodations, and other amenities.
From 2008 to 2013, river cruises saw a 10% annual passenger increase. Europe leads the subcategory, while emerging
destinations include a cruise route along China’s Yangtze River. As the on-board experience differs greatly from a larger
cruise (no play areas, water parks, or on-board stage productions), the target demographic for river cruises is 50- to
70-year-olds. According to Torstein Hagen, founder and chairman of Viking, an international river cruising company,
“with river cruises, a destination is the destination,” although many river cruises are themed around cultural or historical
events (Hill, 2013).

Cruising in Canada
According to a study completed for the North West & Canada Cruise Association (NWCCA) and its partners, in 2012,
approximately 1,100 cruise ship calls were made at Canadian cruise ports generating slightly more than 2 million
passenger arrivals throughout the six-month cruise season (BREA, 2013). The study found three key cruise itineraries in
Canada:
1. Canada/New England
2. Quebec (between Montreal and Quebec City and US ports)
3. Alaska (either departing from, or using, Vancouver or another BC city as a port of call)
These generated $1.16 billion in direct spending. Cruising also generated almost 10,000 full- and part-time jobs paying
$397 million in wages and salaries. The international cruise industry also generated an estimated $269 million in indirect
business and income taxes in Canada, and the majority of this spending was in British Columbia (BREA, 2013).

Cruising BC
BC’s rail history and cruise history are intertwined. As early as 1887, Canadian Pacific Railway began offering steamship
passage to destinations such as Hawaii, Shanghai, Alaska, and Seattle. Ninety-nine years later, Vancouver’s Canada Place
was built, with its cruise ship terminals, allowing the province to attract large ships and capture its share of the growing
international cruise industry (Cruise BC, 2014).

Spotlight On: Cruise BC
Cruise BC is a partnership between BC port destinations designed to provide a vehicle for cooperative

marketing and development of BC’s cruise sector. Their vision is that the West Coast and British Columbia’s
coastal communities are recognized and sought out globally by cruise lines and passengers as a destination
of choice. For more information, visit the Cruise BC website: http://www.cruisebc.ca

This potential continues to grow as Nanaimo, Prince Rupert, Victoria, and Vancouver accounted for 57% of the Canadian
cruise passenger traffic with 1.18 million passengers in 2012 (BREA, 2013).
Cruising isn’t the only way for visitors to experience the waters of BC. In fact, the vast majority of our water travel is
done by ferry. Let’s take a closer look at this vital component of BC’s transportation infrastructure.

Ferries
Ferry service in British Columbia dates back to the mid-1800s when the Hudson’s Bay Company ran ships between
Vancouver Island and the Mainland. Later, CP Rail and Black Ball ferries ran a private service, until 1958 when Premier
W.A.C. Bennett announced the BC Ferry Authority would consolidate the ferries under a provincial mandate.

Figure 2.7 BC ferry: Spirit of Vancouver Island

The MV Tsawwassen and the MV Sidney began regular service on June 15, 1960, and BC Ferries was officially launched
with two terminals and around 200 employees. Today, there are 35 vessels, 47 destinations, and up to 4,700 employees
in the summer peak season (BC Ferries, 2014).
BC isn’t the only destination where ferries make up part of the transportation experience. In 2011, Travel + Leisure
Magazine profiled several notable ferry journeys in the article, “World’s Most Beautiful Ferry Rides” including:
• An 800-mile ferry voyage through Chile’s Patagonian fjords
• A three-mile trip from the Egyptian Spice Market to Istanbul, Turkey
• Urban ferry rides including Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour, Australia’s Sydney Harbour, and New York City’s Staten
34 | Chapter 2. Transportation

Island Ferry
The article also featured the 15-hour trip from Port Hardy to Prince Rupert on British Columbia’s coast (Orcutt, 2011).
While cruising is often a pleasant and relaxing experience, there are a number of safety concerns for vessels of all types.

Cruise and Ferry Safety
One of the major concerns on cruise lines is disease outbreak, specifically the norovirus (a stomach flu), which can
spread quickly on cruise ships as passengers are so close together. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) vessel
sanitation program (http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/default.htm) is designed to help the industry prevent and control
the outset, and spreading, of these types of illnesses (Briggs, 2008).
Accidents are also a concern. In 2006, the BC Ferries vessel MV Queen of the North crashed and sank in the Inside
Passage, leaving two passengers missing and presumed dead. The ship’s navigating officer was charged with criminal
negligence causing their deaths (Keller, 2013). More recently, a “hard landing” at Duke Point terminal on Vancouver
Island caused over $4 million in damage. BC Ferries launched a suit against a German engineering firm in late 2013,
alleging a piece of equipment failed, making a smooth docking impossible. The Transportation Safety Board found that
staff aboard the ship didn’t follow proper docking procedures, however, which contributed to the crash (Canadian Press,
2013).

Spotlight On: The Transportation Safety Board
The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) investigates marine, pipeline, rail, and air incidents. It is an
independent agency that reviews an average of 3,200 events every year. It does not determine liability;
however, coroners and medical examiners may use TSB findings in their investigations. The head office in
Quebec manages 220 staff across the country. For more information, visit the Transportation Safety Board
website: http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/index.asp

We’ve covered the skies, the rails, and the seas. Now let’s round out our investigation of transportation in tourism by
delving into travel on land.

Land
While much of this text has placed significance on the emergence of the railways as critical to the development of our
industry, BC’s roadways have also played an integral role. Our roads have evolved from First Nations trails, to Fur Trade
and Gold Rush routes, to Wagon Roads and Trunk Roads — finally becoming the highway system we know today (British
Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Highways, n.d.).

Chapter 2. Transportation | 35

in our transportation sector. Read this book: Frontier to Freeway: A Short Illustrated History of the Roads in
British Columbia [PDF]: http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/frontiertofreeway/frontiertofreeway.pdf

Today, land-based travel is achieved through a complex web of local transit, taxis, rentals, walking, and shortterm sightseeing. This section briefly explores these options.

Scenic and Sightseeing Travel
It’s common for visitors to want to explore a community and appreciate the sights. We’ve already learned a little about
the rail-based sightseeing company, Rocky Mountaineer. Many destinations also offer short-term, hop-on-hop-off bus
and trolley tours. Others feature trams and trolleys. Outside of impromptu excursions, sightseeing tours are often put
together by inbound tour operators. You can learn more about tour operators, and the sightseeing sector, in Chapter 7.

Transit and Destination Infrastructure
Vancouver’s Tourism Master Plan acknowledges the importance of transportation infrastructure to the tourism
industry. Priorities for future development by the city include (Tourism Vancouver, 2013):
• Improving accessibility for people with disabilities
• Creating a transit loop between downtown attractions
• Supporting ferries in False Creek
• Providing late-night transit
• Investigating and implementing a public bike share
• Developing more transit options along the Broadway corridor
• Working with taxi companies to explore a strategic plan for taxi operations
• Enhancing walkability by implementing recommendations from the Pedestrian Safety Study and Action Plan
These action items were developed in consultation with industry stakeholders as well as residents, and reflect the
interrelated elements that make up a destination’s transportation infrastructure.

36 | Chapter 2. Transportation

Rentals and Taxis

Figure 2.8 A Lincoln Town Car (rental) in San Fransisco

Today, when travellers aren’t using their own cars, automobile travel is traditionally split between rental vehicles and
taxis (including limousines).

Rentals
In North America, there are three main brands that represent approximately 85% of the rental car business: Enterprise
(includes National and Alamo), Hertz (includes Dollar and Thrifty), and Avis. One of the reasons that brands
have consolidated over time is the high fixed cost of operation as vehicles are purchased, maintained, and disposed of.
Fierce competition means prices are checked and updated thousands of times a day. The business is also highly seasonal,
with high traffic in summer and spring, and so fleet management is critical for profitability. Rental companies tend to
use enplanements (the numbers of passengers travelling by air), as a measurement of market trends that influence rental
usage (DBRS, 2010).

Taxis
In BC, taxi licences are issued by the BC Passenger Transportation Board. In Vancouver, the right to operate a taxi is
based on a permit system, and each permit costs the original holder $100. But because of the limited number of permits
available, those who hold one are able to auction it off for over $800,000 and keep the profit. As a result, passengers in
Vancouver paid an average of 73% more for the equivalent trip in Washington, D.C. Drivers from areas outside the city
depositing passengers in Vancouver are also not permitted to pick up fares on the return trip, having to drive across
their boundaries (Proctor, 2014).
Ridesharing apps like Uber, which allow people to find a ride using their mobile phone, have emerged to exert influence
on car travel in key destinations. In San Francisco, these apps have rapidly undercut the taxi industry: according to the

Chapter 2. Transportation | 37

city’s transit authority, per month, trips by taxi have plummeted from 1,424 in 2012 to 504 in 2014, even though taxi
operators maintain a monopoly over rides from the airport (Kuittinen, 2014). In New York City, however, the price of
medallions (similar to Vancouver’s taxi permits) continues to hover above $950,000. In large markets like Manhattan,
passengers continue to hail cabs on the street in the moment, with e-hails (electronic taxi hails) at 0.17% of the market
(Brustein & Winter, 2014). The City of Vancouver opted to force Uber to roll back after its initial release, and in 2014
placed the app on a six-month moratorium after pressure from taxi operators who cited threats to the values of their
licences as well as safety and monitoring concerns (CTV News, 2014b).
As this and other examples illustrate, the transportation sector is vulnerable to regulatory, technological, operational,
and business trends. Let’s look at these in more detail.

Trends and Issues
This section explores issues directly relating to transportation today including fuel cost, labour, and environmental
impacts. For more information on one of the biggest trends in tourism, online travel agencies (OTAs), and how online
bookings impact the transportation sector, please see Chapter 7.

Fuel Cost
When it comes to moving people, fuel cost is critical. The cost of jet fuel is one of the single highest factors in airline
profitability. In 2013, the average cost was around $125 per barrel, which was $5 less than the previous year (IATA, 2014a).
Cruise ships consume a lower grade of diesel than do land vehicles, but they consume a lot of it. The QE2, for example,
consumes roughly 380 tonnes of fuel every day if travelling at 28.5 knots (Briggs, 2008).

Labour
As in all tourism-related sectors, cyclical labour shortages can significantly impact the transportation industry. In the
aviation sector, a forecast found that by 2032 the world’s airlines will need 460,000 additional pilots and 650,000 new
maintenance technicians to service current and future aircraft. The drive to find employees also extends to the maritime
sector, where the International Maritime Organization (IMO) launched a “Go to sea!” campaign to attract more workers
to the field (PWC, 2012).

Environmental Impacts
In addition to fuel and labour costs, and regulations we’ve covered already, the transportation sector has a significant
impact on the natural environment.

38 | Chapter 2. Transportation

Air Impacts
According to the David Suzuki Foundation (2014), the aviation industry is responsible for 4% to 9% of climate change
impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions from flights have risen 83% since 1990. Airline travel has a greater emissions
impact than driving or taking the train per passenger kilometre, which caused a bishop in the UK to famously declare
that “Making selfish choices such as flying on holiday [is] a symptom of sin” (Barrow, 2006).

Rail Impacts
Rail travel is widely regarded as one of the most environmentally friendly modes of transportation due to its low carbon
dioxide emissions. Railways come under fire outside of the tourism realm, however, as freight shipping can produce
hazards to resident health including an increased risk of developing cancer and noise pollution (The Impact Project,
2012).

Cruise Impacts
Cruise ships can generate significant pollution from black water (containing human waste), grey water (runoff from
showers, dishwashers, sinks), bilge water (from the lowest compartment of the ship), solid waste (trash), and chemical
waste (cleaners, solvents, oil). One ship can create almost a million litres of grey water, over 113,000 litres of black water,
and over 140,000 litres of bilge water every day. Depending on the regulations in the operating areas, ships can simply
dump this waste directly into the ocean. Ballast tanks, filled to keep the ship afloat, can be contaminated with species
which are then transported to other areas, disrupting sensitive ecosystems (Briggs, 2008).

Land Impacts
A recent study found that the impact of travel on land is highly dependent on the number of passengers. Whereas
travelling alone in a large SUV can have high emissions per person (as high as flying), increasing the number of
passengers, and using a smaller vehicle, can bring the impact down to that of train travel (Science Daily, 2013).
For more information on the environmental impacts of the transportation sector, and how to mitigate these, read
Chapter 10.

Weather
As you’ve learned, the transportation sector can have an effect on climate change, and changes in weather have a strong
effect on transportation. According to Natural Resources Canada (2013), some of these include:
• More drastic freeze-thaw cycles, destroying pavement and causing ruts in asphalt
• Increased precipitation causing landslides, washing out roads, and derailing trains
• Effects and costs of additional de-icing chemicals deployed on aircraft and runways (over 50 million litres were
used worldwide in 2013)
• Delayed flights and sailings due to increased storm activity
Chapter 2. Transportation | 39

• Millions of dollars of infrastructure upgrades required as sea levels increase and flood structures (replacing or
relocating bridges, tunnels, ports, docks, dykes, helipads and airports)
The threat of climate change could significantly impact sea-level airports such as YVR, and some 50 additional
registered airports across Canada that sit at five metres or less above sea level (Natural Resources Canada, 2013).
For this reason, it’s important that the sector continue to press for innovations and greener transportation choices, if
only to ensure future financial costs are kept at bay.

Figure 2.9 A flight is grounded for seven hours at Baltimore Airport due to severe
weather

Conclusion
Tourism, freight, and resource industries such as forestry and mining sometimes compete for highways, waterways, and
airways. It’s important for governments to engage with various stakeholders and attempt to juggle various economic
priorities — and for tourism to be at the table during these discussions.
That’s why in 2015 the BC Ministry of Transportation released its 10-year plan, BC on the Move. Groups like the Tourism
Industry Association of BC actively polled their members in order to have their concerns incorporated into the plan.
These included highway signage and wayfaring, the future of BC Ferries, and urban infrastructure improvements.

Case Study: Air North

Founded in 1977 by Joseph Sparling and Tom Wood, Air North is a regional airline providing passenger and cargo
service between Yukon and destinations including BC, Alberta, and Alaska. In 2012, Air North surpassed one
million passengers carried. Employing over 200 people, the airline is owned in significant part by the Vuntut
Development Corporation, the economic arm of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (VGFN). In fact, one in 15
Yukoners owns a stake in the airline (Air North, 2015).
The ownership model has meant that economic returns are not always the priority for shareholders. As stated
on its website, “the maximization of profit is not the number one priority,” as air service is a “lifeline” to the
VGFN community. For this reason, service and pricing of flights is extremely important, as are employment
opportunities.
Visit the corporate information portion of the Air North website and answer the following questions:
http://www.flyairnorth.com/Experience/about-air-north.aspx
1. What is the number one priority of Air North? How is the company structured to ensure it can meet its
goals in this area?
2. What does Air North consider to be its competitive advantage? How does this differ from other airlines?
3. Describe the investment portfolio of the Vuntut Development Corporation. What types of companies
does it own? Why might they have selected these types of initiatives?
4. List at least three groups that have a stake in the airline. What are their interests? Where do their
interests line up, and where do they compete?
5. In your opinion, would this regional airline model work in your community? Why or why not?

Chapter 3. Accommodation
REBECCA WILSON-MAH

Learning Objectives

• Explain the contribution the accommodations sector makes to Canada’s economy
• Identify how a hotel category is determined, and describe different hotel categories in Canada
• Explain the meaning and structure of independent ownership, franchise agreements, and management
contracts
• Summarize current accommodation trends
• Discuss the structure of hotel operations

Overview
In essence, hospitality is made up of two services: the provision of overnight accommodation for people travelling away
from home, and options for people dining outside their home. We refer to the accommodation and food and beverage
services sectors together as the hospitality industry. This chapter explores the accommodation sector, and the Chapter
4 details the food and beverage sector.

Figure 3.1 The view from a balcony at the Westin Bayshore hotel in downtown Vancouver

In Canada, approximately 25% to 35% of visitor spending is attributed to accommodation, making it a substantial portion
of travel expenditures.

Hotels
There were 8,090 hotel properties with a total of 440,123 rooms in Canada in 2014. Direct spending on overnight stays
was $16.7 billion, and the year’s average occupancy rate was forecast at 64%. Across the country the sector employed

46 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

287,000 people (Hotel Association of Canada, 2014). According to go2HR, “with a projected rate of annual employment
growth of 1.5 per cent, there will be 18,920 job openings between 2011 and 2020” (2015a).
In order to understand this large and significant sector, we will explore the history and importance of hotels in Canada,
and review the hotel types along with various ownership structures and operational considerations. To complete the
chapter, we will identify accommodation alternatives and specific trends that are affecting the accommodation sector
today.

Spotlight On: The Hotel Association of Canada
The Hotel Association of Canada (HAC) is the national trade organization advocating on behalf of over
8,500 hotels. Founded over 100 years ago, the association also provides professional development resources,
discounts with vendors, and industry research including statistics monitoring and an extensive member
database. For more information, visit the Hotel Association of Canada website: www.hotelassociation.ca

The History of Hotels in Canada
As we learned in Chapter 2, travel in Europe, North America, and Australia developed with the establishment of railway
networks and train travel in the mid-1800s. The history of Canada’s grand hotels is also the story of Canada’s ocean liners
and railways. Until the use of personal cars became widespread in the 1920s and 1930s, and taxpayer-funded all-weather
highways were created, railways were the only long-distance land transportation available in Canada.
Both of Canada’s railway companies established hotel divisions: Canadian Pacific Hotels and Canadian National Hotels
(Canada History, 2013). The first hotels were small and included Glacier House in Glacier National Park, BC, and Mount
Stephen House in Field, BC. The hotel business was firmly established when both companies recognized the business
opportunity in the growth of tourism, and they soon became rivals, building grand hotels in select locations close to
railway stops.

Spotlight On: Canadian Pacific Hotels
Under the guidance of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) chief engineer and visionary William Cornelius Van
Horne, a hotel empire was born (Canada History, 2013). Van Horne was a pioneer of tourism, and like Thomas
Cook in the UK, he saw the potential for tourism that was made possible by the railway. Van Horne was
famously quoted in 1886, “If we can’t export the scenery, we’ll import the tourists.” In 1999, many historic CPR
properties joined the Fairmont brand. For more information, visit the Fairmont website: www.fairmont.com/

Figure 3.2 The Banff Springs Hotel today

Banff Springs Hotel opened in 1888, and other hotels soon followed, including the Château Frontenac in Quebec City
(1893), the Royal York in Toronto (1929), and the Hotel Vancouver (1939). These hotels remain in operation today
and are landmarks in their destinations, functioning as accommodations and as local attractions due to their historic
significance and outstanding architecture.
Through the 1950s and 1960s, an increase in motor traffic saw the rise of the motel. The word motel, used less commonly
today, comes from the term “motorist’s hotel,” used to denote a hotel that provides ample parking and rooms that are
easily accessible from the parking lot. Traditionally, these structures were designed with all the rooms facing the parking
lot, and relied heavily on motor traffic from nearby highways (Diffen, 2015).
Today, there are a number of hotel types, which can be classified in multiple ways. Let’s explore these classifications in
more detail.

Hotel Types
Hotels are typically referred to by hotel type or category. The type of hotel is determined primarily by the size and
location of the building structure, and then by the function, target market, service level, other amenities, and industry
standards.

Take a Closer Look: Hotelier
The magazine Hotelier, available online and in eight annual print editions, is a resource relied on by many
industry professionals across Canada. Featuring profiles of successful hoteliers, information about specific

Competitive set is a marketing term used to identify a group of hotels that include the competitors that a hotel guest
is likely to consider as an alternative. These can be grouped by any of the classifications listed in Table 3.1, such as size,
location, or amenities offered. There must be a minimum of three hotels to qualify as a competitive set.

Figure 3.3 A wedding on the rooftop of the Pan Pacific Hotel in Vancouver, adjacent to the Vancouver
Convention Centre

Business hotels, airport hotels, budget hotels, boutique hotels, convention hotels, and casino hotels are some examples
of differentiated hotel concepts and services designed to meet a specific market segment. As companies continue to
innovate and compete to capture defined niche markets within each set, we can expect to see the continued expansion
of specific concepts. For example, hotels found close to, or even within, convention facilities are a great match for
meetings and events, as well as the SMERF market (social, military, educational, religious, and fraternal segment of the
group travel market).

Spotlight On: BC Hotel Association
The BC Hotel Association (BCHA) represents over 600 members and 200 associate members — accounting
for 80,000 rooms and more than 60,000 employees. The association produces an annual industry trade show

and seminar series, and publishes InnFocus magazine for professionals in the trade. For more information,
visit the BC Hotel Association website: www.bchotelassociation.com

Table 3.2 outlines the characteristics of specific hotel types that have evolved to match the needs of a particular traveller
segment. As you can see, hotels adapt and diversify depending on the markets they want and need to attract to stay in
business.

Let’s now take a closer look at three types of hotel that have emerged to meet specific market needs: budget hotels,
boutique hotels, and resorts.

Budget Hotels
The term budget hotel is challenging to define, however most budget properties typically have a standardized
appearance and offer basic services with limited food and beverage facilities. Budget hotels were first developed in the
United States and built along the interstate highway system. The first Holiday Inn opened in the United States in 1952;
the first Quality Motel followed in 1963.
In Europe, Accor operates the predominant European-branded budget rooms. Accor has four hotel brands that were

Chapter 3. Accommodation | 53

recently redesigned: hotelF1, ibis budget, ibis Styles, and ibis. These budget brands offer comfort, modern design, and
breakfast on site; ibis Styles is all inclusive, with one price for room night, breakfast, and internet access (Accor, 2015).
The budget brands owned by Accor are an example of a shift toward the budget boutique hotel style. A relatively new
category of hotel, budget boutique is a no-frills boutique experience that still provides style, comfort, and a unique
atmosphere. Starwood has entered this category with a scaled down version of W with the new Aloft brand that debuted
in Montreal in 2008 (Starwood Hotels, 2011).

Boutique Hotels

Figure 3.4 A picture of a welcome gift and note for a returning guest at the
Magnolia Hotel and Spa, posted online by the guest

Canada currently has no industry standards to define boutique hotels, but these hotels generally share some common
features. These include having less than 100 rooms and featuring a distinctive design style and on-site food and beverage
options (Boutique Hotel Association, n.d.). As a reflection of the size of the hotel, a boutique hotel is typically intimate
and has an easily identifiable atmosphere, such as classic, luxurious, quirky, or funky.
According to Bill Lewis, general manager for the Magnolia Hotel and Spa in Victoria, “guests seek out boutique hotels
for their small size, individual design style, … and personalized service.” He feels that “maintaining this service level in
a small hotel allows for a very personalized and intimate experience that cannot be matched in large branded hotels”
(personal communication, 2014).

Resorts
A resort is a full-service hotel that provides access to or offers a range of recreation facilities and amenities. A resort is
typically the primary provider of the guest experience and will generally have one signature amenity or attraction (Brey,
2009).
54 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

Examples of signature amenities include skiing and mountains, golf, beach and ocean, lakeside, casino and gaming, all
inclusiveness, spa and wellness, marina, tennis, and waterpark. In addition, resorts also offer secondary experiences and
a leisure or retreat-style environment.

Take a Closer Look: Condé Nast Best Hotels and Resorts in Canada 2014
Condé Nast Traveler and the CN publishing family have many well-regarded “best of” lists, one of which is the
Best Hotels and Resorts in Canada. In 2014, three of the top 10 were in BC, with the Wickaninnish Inn and
Black Rock Oceanfront Resort earning first and second place. You can read the rest of the list at, “The Best
Hotels and Resorts in Canada: 2014”: www.cntraveler.com/gold-list/2014/americas/canada

Now that we understand the classifications of hotel types, let’s gain a deeper understanding of the various ownership
structures in the industry.

Ownership Structures
There are several ownership models employed in the sector today, including independent, management contract, chains
and franchise agreements, fractional ownership, and full ownership strata units. This section explains each of these in
more detail and provides examples of each.

Independent

Figure 3.5 The exterior of the Wedgewood in downtown Vancouver

An independent hotel is financed by one individual or a small group and is directly managed by its owners or third-party
operators. The term independent refers to a management system that is free from outside control.
Chapter 3. Accommodation | 55

There are a number of very well-established independently branded hotels. These hotel companies have developed their
own standards, support systems, policies and procedures, and best practices in all areas of the business. Independent
hotels have the flexibility to customize or adjust their systems to position their property for success, and the location,
product, service, experience, sales and marketing, and brand are all necessary for that success (Cabañas, 2014). An
example of an independent hotel is the Wedgewood Hotel and Spa in Vancouver, founded by Eleni Skalbania, and
currently co-owned by her daughter Elpie (Wedgewood, 2015).

Management Contract
Another business model is a management contract. This is a service offered by a management company to manage
a hotel or resort for its owners. Owners have two main options for the structure of a management contract. One is
to enter into a separate franchise agreement to secure a brand and then engage an independent third-party hotel
management company to manage the hotel. SilverBirch Hotels is an example of a hotel management company that
manages independent hotels and hotels operating under different major franchise brands, such as Marriott, Hilton, and
Radisson (SilverBirch Hotels, 2015).

Figure 3.6 The iconic Fairmont Empress Hotel, purchased in 2014 by Nat and Flora Bosa

A slightly different option is for owners to select a single company to provide the brand and the expertise to manage the
property. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and Fairmont Hotels and Resorts are companies that provide this option to
owners. In 2014, the iconic Fairmont Empress hotel was purchased by Vancouver developer Nat Bosa and his wife Flora,
who continued to retain Fairmont as the management company after the purchase (Meiszner, 2014).
Selecting a brand affiliation is one of the most significant decisions hotel owners must make (Crandell, Dickinson,
& Kante, 2004). The brand affiliation selected will largely determine the cost of hotel development or conversion of
an existing property to meet new brand standards. The affiliation will also determine a number of things about the
ongoing operation including the level of services and amenities offered, cost of operation, marketing opportunities
or restrictions, and the competitive position in the marketplace. For these reasons, owners typically consider several
branding options before choosing to operate independently or selecting a brand affiliation.

Chains and Franchise Agreements

Figure 3.7 A room at the Coast Bastion Hotel in Nanaimo

Another managerial and ownership structure is franchising. A hotel franchise enables individuals or investment
companies (the franchisee) to build or purchase a hotel and then buy or lease a brand name to operate a business and
become part of a chain of hotels using the franchisor’s hotel brand, image, goodwill, procedures, controls, marketing,
and reservations systems (Rushmore, 2005).
A well-known franchise in BC is Coast Hotels. A franchisee with Coast Hotels becomes part of a network of properties
that use a central reservations system with access to electronic distribution channels, regional and national marketing
programs, central purchasing, and brand operating standards (Coast Hotels, 2015). A franchisee also receives training,
support, and advice from the franchisor and must adhere to regular inspections, audits, and reporting requirements.
Selecting a franchise structure may reduce investment risk by enabling the franchisee to associate with an established
hotel company. Franchise fees can be substantial and a franchisee must be willing to adhere to the contractual
obligations with the franchisor (Migdal, n.d.; and Rushmore, 2005). Franchise fees typically include an initial fee paid
with the franchise application, and then continuing fees paid during the term of the agreement. These fees are
sometimes a percentage of revenue but can be set at a fixed fee. Franchise fees generally range from 4% to 7% of gross
rooms revenue (Crandell et al., 2004).

Fractional Ownership
In a fractional ownership model, developers finance hotel builds by selling units in one-eighth to one-quarter shares.
This financing model was very popular in BC from the late 1990s to 2008 (Western Investor, 2012). Examples of fractional
ownership include the Sun Peaks Ski Resort in Kamloops and the Penticton Lakeside Resort.
In this model, owners can place their unit in a rental pool. The investment return for owners is based on the term

Chapter 3. Accommodation | 57

Figure 3.8 The Sun Peaks Resort hotel

s of the contract they have for their unit, the strata fees, and the hotel’s occupancy. Managing fractional ownership can
be very time consuming for hotel owners or management companies as each hotel unit can have up to eight owners.
If occupancy rates are too low, an owner may not be able to cover the monthly strata fees. For the hotel management
company, attaining occupancy rate targets is necessary to ensure that the balance of revenue is sufficient to cover the
hotel’s operating expenses.
Developers now anticipate that fractional ownership will not be used to finance new hotel builds in the future due
to poor performance. There have been some high-profile collapses for hotel developers in BC, and between 2002 and
2012 fractional hotel owners experienced asset depreciation (Western Investor, 2012). It is uncertain how the market will
perform in the next several years.

58 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

Full Ownership Strata Units

Figure 3.9 The Rosewood Hotel Georgia, a restored historic
hotel in downtown Vancouver

In this financing model, hotel developers finance a new hotel build with the sale of full ownership strata units. The sale of
the condominium units finances the hotel development. Examples include the Fairmont Pacific Rim and the Rosewood
Hotel Georgia.

Spotlight On: The BC Hospitality Foundation
The BC Hospitality Foundation (BCHF) was created to help support hospitality (accommodation and food
and beverage) professionals in their time of need. It has expanded to become a provider of scholarships
for students in hospitality management and culinary programs. To raise funds for these initiatives, the
foundation hosts annual events including Dish and Dazzle and a golf tournament. For more information,
visit the BC Hospitality Foundation website: bchospitalityfoundation.com

No matter what the ownership model, it’s critical for properties to offer a return on investment for owners. The next
section looks at ways of measuring financial performance in the sector.
Chapter 3. Accommodation | 59

Financial Performance
According to hotel consultant Betsy McDonald from HVS International Hotel Consultancy, the “industry rule of thumb is
that a hotel room must make $1 per night for every $1,000 it takes to build or buy. If the hotel costs $125,000 per [room],
the room has to rent for $125 per night on average and you need 60% to 70% occupancy to break even” (McDonald, 2011).
Several terms and formulas are used to evaluate revenue management strategies and operational efficiency:
Occupancy is a term that refers to the percentage of all guest rooms in the hotel that are occupied at a given time.
Average daily rate (ADR) is a calculation that states the average guest room income per occupied room in a given time
period. It is determined by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold.
Revenue per available room (RevPAR ) is a calculation that combines both occupancy and ADR in one metric. It is
calculated by multiplying a hotel’s ADR by its occupancy rate. It may also be calculated by dividing a hotel’s total
room revenue by the total number of available rooms and the number of days in the period being measured.
Costs per occupied room (COPR) is a figure that states all the costs associated with making a room ready for a guest
(linens, cleaning costs, guest amenities).
These terms and measurements allow hotel staff and management to track the success of the operation and to compare
against competitors and regional averages.

Across all ownership models, most properties have operational aspects in common. But before we take a closer look at
the roles within a typical hotel, let’s review an important part of the accommodations sector in Canada and BC: camping
and recreational vehicle (RV) stays.

60 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

Camping and RV Accommodation

Figure 3.10 A group of campers enjoy the night sky from their tents

A significant portion of travel accommodation is also provided in campgrounds and recreational vehicles (RVs). As the
Canadian and BC tourism brands are closely tied to the outdoors, and these are two options that immerse travellers in
the outdoor experience, it is no surprise that these two types of accommodation are popular options.
In 2011, 14% of Canadian households owned an RV, with over 1 million RVs on the road in the country that year. Economic
activity associated with RVing generated approximately $14.5 billion. Across the country 3,000 independently owned
and operated campgrounds welcomed guests for camping in RVs and in tents that year (CNW, 2014).

Spotlight On: Camping and RVing British Columbia Coalition
The Camping and RVing British Columbia Coalition (CRVBCC) represents campground managers and
brings together additional stakeholders including the Recreation Vehicle Dealers Association of BC and the
Freshwater Fisheries Society. Their aim is to increase the profile of camping and RV experiences throughout
BC, achieving this through a website, a blog, and media outreach. For more information, visit the Camping
and RVing British Columbia Coalition website: www.campingrvbc.com

According to the Camping and RVing British Columbia Coalition (CRVBCC, 2014), BC is home to 340 vehicle accessible
campgrounds managed by the BC Society of Park Facility Operators, and Destination British Columbia inspects and
approves over 500 campgrounds across the province. Seven national parks within the province contain an additional
14 campgrounds, and the BC Recreation Sites and Trails Branch manages more than 1,200 backcountry sites including
campgrounds and other facilities. Another 300 private RV parks and campgrounds play host to a mixture of longer-stay
residents and overnight guests.

Spotlight On: the BC Lodging and Campgrounds Association

Chapter 3. Accommodation | 61

The BC Lodging and Campgrounds Association (BCLCA) was founded in 1944 to represent the interests
of independently owned campgrounds and lodges. It provides advocacy and collaborative marketing, and
promotes best practice among members. For more information, visit the BC Lodging and Campgrounds
Association website: www.travel-british-columbia.com

In 2014, national industry associations began to call on the government for taxation relief and marketing help to ensure
this segment of the sector could continue to thrive. They also highlighted the need to increase the operating hours
and seasons of publicly funded campgrounds to match the private sector and to ensure continuity of service for guests
(CNW, 2014). Closer to home, the BCLCA (see Spotlight On above) continues to advocate for equitable property tax
arrangements, support with employment issues, and other policies relating to land and water use for their members.
Chapter 5 provides more in-depth information about the importance of the recreation sector to BC. For now, let’s
move our discussion forward by taking a closer look at the common organizational structure of many accommodation
businesses.

Operations
The organizational structures of operations and the number of roles and levels of responsibility vary depending on
the type and size of accommodation. They are also determined by ownership and the standards and procedures of
the management company. In this section, we explore the organizational structure and roles that are typically in
place in a full-service hotel with under 500 rooms. These can also apply to smaller properties and businesses such as
campgrounds — although in these cases several roles might be fulfilled by the same person.

Guest Services

Figure 3.11 Vicky welcomes guests to the front desk of the Delta Burnaby Hotel
62 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

Before we turn to examples of specific operational roles, let’s take a brief look at the importance of guest services, which
will be covered in full in Chapter 9.
The accommodation sector provides much more than tangible products such as guest rooms, beds and meals; service is
also crucial. Regardless of their role in the operation, all employees must do their part to ensure that each guest’s needs,
preferences, and expectations are met and satisfied.
In some cases, such as in a luxury hotel, resort hotel, or an all-inclusive property, the guest services may represent a
person’s entire vacation experience. In other cases, the service might be less significant, for example, in a budget airport
hotel where location is the key driver, or a campground where guests primarily expect to take care of themselves.
In all cases, operators and employees must recognize and understand guest expectations and also what drives
their satisfaction and loyalty. When the key drivers of guest satisfaction are understood, the hotel can ensure that
service standards and business practices and policies support employees to deliver on these needs and that guest
expectations are satisfied or exceeded.

General Manager and Director of Operations
In most properties, the general manager or hotel manager serves as the head executive. Division heads oversee various
departments including managers, administrative staff, and line-level supervisors. The general manager’s role is to
provide strategic leadership and planning to all departments so revenue is maximized, employee relations are strong,
and guests are satisfied.
The director of operations is responsible for overseeing the food and beverage and rooms division. This role is also
responsible for providing guidance to department heads to achieve their targets and for directing the day-to-day
operations of their respective departments. The director of operations also assumes the responsibilities of the general
manager when he or she is absent from the property.

Accounting
The controller is responsible for overall accounting and finance-related activities including accounts receivable,
accounts payable, payroll, credit, systems management, cash management, food and beverage cost control, receiving,
purchasing, food stores, yield management, capital planning, and budgeting.

Chapter 3. Accommodation | 63

Engineering and Maintenance
The chief engineer is the lead for the effective operation and maintenance of the property on a day-to-day basis,
typically including general maintenance, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, kitchen maintenance, carpentry, and
electrical and plumbing (Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, 2015). The chief engineer is also responsible for preventive
maintenance and resource management programs.

Food and Beverage Division

Figure 3.12 A guest enjoys breakfast in her room at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Vancouver

The food and beverage director is responsible for catering and events, in-room dining, and stand-alone restaurants and
bars. The executive chef, the director of banquets, and the assistant managers responsible for each restaurant report to
the director of food and beverage. The director assists with promotions and sales, the annual food and beverage budget,
and all other aspects of food and beverage operations to continually improve service and maximize profitability.

Human Resources
The human resources department provides guidance and advice on a wide range of management-related practices
including recruitment and selection, training and development, employee relations, rewards and recognition,
performance management, and health and safety.

64 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

Rooms Division
Front Office
Reporting to the director of rooms, the front office manager, sometimes called the reception manager, controls the
availability of rooms and the day-to-day functions of the front office. The front desk agent reports to the front
office manager and works in the lobby or reception area to welcome the guests to the property, process arrivals and
departures, coordinate room assignments and pre-arrivals, and respond to guest requests.

Housekeeping
Reporting to the director of rooms, the executive housekeeper manages and oversees housekeeping operations and staff
including the housekeeping manager, supervisor, house persons, and room attendants. An executive housekeeper is
responsible for implementing the operating procedures and standards. He or she also plans, coordinates, and schedules
the housekeeping staff. Room audits and inspections are completed regularly to ensure standards are met (go2HR,
2015b).
Reporting to the housekeeping supervisor, room attendants complete the day-to-day task of cleaning rooms based on
standard operating procedures and respond to guest requests. Reporting to the housekeeping supervisor, house persons
clean public areas including hallways, the lobby, and public restrooms, and deliver laundry and linens to guest rooms.

Reservations
Large full-service hotels typically have a reservations department, and the reservations manager reports directly to the
front office manager. The guest’s experience starts with the first interaction a guest has with a property, often during
the reservation process. Reservations agents convert calls to sales by offering the guest the opportunity to not only
make a room reservation but also book other amenities and activities.
Today, with online and website reservations available to guests, there is still a role for the reservations agent, as some
guests prefer the one-to-one connection with another person. The extent to which the reservations agent position is
resourced will vary depending on the hotel’s target market and business strategy.

Sales and Marketing
The sales and marketing director is responsible for establishing sales and marketing activities that maximize the
hotel’s revenues. This is typically accomplished by increasing occupancy and revenue opportunities for the hotel’s
accommodation, conference and catering space, leisure facilities, and food and beverage outlets. The sales and
marketing manager is responsible for coordinating marketing and promotional activities and works closely with other
hotel departments to ensure customers are satisfied with all aspects of their experience (go2HR, 2015c).

Chapter 3. Accommodation | 65

Catering and Conference Services
In larger full-service hotels with conference space, a hotel will have a dedicated catering and conference services
department. The director of this department typically reports to the director of sales and marketing. The catering and
conference services department coordinates all events held in the hotel or catered off-site. Catering and conference
events and services range from small business meetings to high-profile conferences and weddings.

Figure 3.13 The culinary team at Café Pacifica in the Pan Pacific prepares food for a special event

Now that we have a sense of the building blocks of a typical hotel operation, let’s look at some trends affecting the sector.

Trends and Issues
The accommodation sector is sensitive to shifting local, regional, and global economic, social, and political conditions.
Businesses must be flexible to meet the needs of their different markets and evolving trends. These trends affect all
hotel types, regions, and destinations differently. However, overall, hoteliers must respond to these trends in a business
landscape that is increasingly competitive, particularly in markets where the supply base is growing faster than demand
(Hotelier, 2014).

The Sharing Economy: Airbnb
The sharing economy is a relatively new economic model in which people rent beds, cars, boats, and other underutilized
assets directly from each other, all coordinated via the internet (The Economist, 2013). Airbnb is the most prominent

66 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

example of this model. It provides a platform for travellers and manages all aspects of the relationship without requiring
any paperwork.
At Airbnb, the host who rents out the space controls the price, the description of the space, and the guest experience.
The host also makes the house rules and has full control over who books the space. As well, both hosts and guests
can rate each other and write reviews on the website (Cole, 2014).
Airbnb began in 2008 when the founders rented their air mattresses to three visitors in San Francisco (Fast Company,
2012). In fact, the name Airbnb is derived from “air mattress bed and breakfast.” However, Airbnb is not only for couch
surfers or budget-conscious travellers; it includes a wide range of spaces in locations all over the world. When users
create an account, they set the price and write the descriptions to advertise the space to guests (Airbnb, 2015). Since
2008, the Airbnb online marketplace has grown rapidly, with more than 1 million properties worldwide and 30 million
guests who used the service by the end of 2014 (Melloy, 2015).

Figure 3.14 The Airbnb home page on a user’s mobile phone

This and other innovations have changed the accommodation landscape as never before. Ten to 15 years ago online
travel agents were a major innovation that changed the distribution and sale of rooms. But they still had to work with
existing hotels, whereas Airbnb has enabled new entrants into the industry and thus increased supply.
On the supply side, Airbnb enables individuals to share their spare space for rent; on the demand side, consumers using
Airbnb benefit from increased competition and more choice. An unanswered question is to what extent Airbnb has
impacted the hospitality industry at large and how it will impact it in the future. A study completed in 2014 in Austin,
Texas, indicates that lower-end hotels, and hotels not catering to business travellers, are more vulnerable to increased
Chapter 3. Accommodation | 67

competition from rentals enabled by firms like Airbnb than are hotels without these characteristics (Zervas, Preserpio,
& Byers, 2015).

Distribution and Online Travel Agents
Online travel agents (OTAs) are a valuable marketing and third-party distribution resource for hotels and play a
significant role in online distribution (Inversini & Masiero, 2014). In the first quarter of 2014, 13.2% of hotel bookings for
individual leisure and business travellers (TravelClick, 2014) were made through OTAs (for example, Expedia, Hotels.com,
Kayak.com).
OTAs offer global distribution so that each hotel and chain can be available to anyone at the click of a button (Then
Hospitality, 2014). Smaller independent hotels that do not have the global marketing and sales resources of a larger chain
are able to gain exposure, sell rooms, and build their reputation through online guest ratings and reviews. OTAs also help
hotels offer combined value and packaging options that are attractive to many consumers (for example, booking and
search options for hotels, car rentals, air fare, attractions, and travel packages). Customized searches, travel guidance,
and rewards points are also available when booking through an OTA. If a hotel or chain has an exceptional product and
service, OTAs share guest ratings, which can increase the number of reservations and referrals.
Chris Anderson at the Center for Hospitality Research at Cornell University analyzed 1,720 reservations made on the
websites of six InterContinental Hotels brands (2012). Anderson found that every booking made on Expedia attracted
three to nine reservations to the hotel’s site, suggesting the commission a hotel pays an OTA is a cost-effective expense,
as it generates additional revenues.
The general industry guidance for hotels using OTAs is to ensure that this distribution channel is part of a broader sales
strategy, coupled with sound customer relationship management practices.
Table 3.4 provides an overview of some of the distribution channels that are available to hoteliers.

Online Bookings and Mobile Devices
In 2014, 27% of online bookings in leading regions in the United States were made by consumers using their mobile
devices and tablets (Travel Click, 2014). As the trend continues, hoteliers are adapting their e-commerce strategy to
respond appropriately and to understand what consumers in their hotel segment need, want, and expect from the
mobile booking experience. According to Travel Click (2014), same-day reservations are also on the rise. Bookings made
with mobile devices can be incentivized by offers for deals such as mobile-specific rate plans or discounts to directly
target last-minute shoppers.

Conclusion
The accommodation sector, and the hotel sector in particular, encompasses multiple business models and employs
hundreds of thousands of Canadians. A smaller, but important segment in BC is that of camping and RV accommodators.
As broader societal trends continue and morph, they will continue to impact the accommodations marketplace and

70 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

consumer. Owners and operators must stay abreast of these trends, continually altering their business models and
services to remain relevant and competitive.
Now that we have a better sense of the accommodation sector, let’s visit the other half of the hospitality industry: food

Case Study: Hotel for Dogs – Philanthropy and Media Coverage

In 2014, the media was taken by storm with a story about a hotel in North Carolina that combined philanthropy
with their business model. The property expanded on the trend of allowing dogs in hotels by fostering
rescues from a nearby shelter and allowing guests to adopt them. Guests appreciated the warm interactions
with the animals and several dogs were adopted as a result (Manning, 2014).Not only did the property provide
a valuable service and enhance the guest experience, but the story was repeated across multiple media outlets,
creating publicity for the hotel.
This is an example of a current trend: allowing pets in hotels. Now choose from one of the following trends, and
research it to answer the questions that follow:
• Carbon offset programs
• Customization
• Reputation management
• Digital concierge

72 | Chapter 3. Accommodation

• Themed sleep
• Lifestyle food choices
• Educational experiences
• Millennial traveller
• Sharing economy
• Green certified
• Extreme experiences
1. Why do you think this trend has emerged? What market is it helping to serve?
2. Find an example of a hotel that has responded to your chosen trend and explain how the trend has
informed or changed the hotel’s business strategy or practice.
3. Are there any trends that are not listed above that you think should be added? Try to name at least two.

PETER BRISCOE AND GRIFF TRIPP

Learning Objectives

• Describe the origins and significance of the food and beverage sector
• Relate the importance of the sector to the Canadian economy
• Explain the various types of food and beverage providers
• Discuss differing needs and desires of residents and visitors in selecting a food and beverage provider
• Examine factors that contribute to the profitability of food and beverage operations
• Discuss key issues and trends in the sector including government influence, health and safety, human
resources, and technology

Overview
According to Statistics Canada, the food and beverage sector comprises “establishments primarily engaged in preparing
meals, snacks and beverages, to customer order, for immediate consumption on and off the premises” (Government of
Canada, 2012). This sector is commonly known to tourism professionals by its initials as F&B.
The food and beverage sector grew out of simple origins: as people travelled from their homes, going about their
business, they often had a need or desire to eat or drink. Others were encouraged to meet this demand by supplying
food and drink. As the interests of the public became more diverse, so too did the offerings of the food and beverage
sector.
In 2014, Canadian food and beverage businesses accounted for 1.1 million employees and more than 88,000 locations
across the country with an estimated $71 billion in sales, representing around 4% of the country’s overall economic
activity. Many students are familiar with the sector through their workplace, because Canada’s restaurants provide one
in every five youth jobs in the country — with 22% of Canadians starting their career in a restaurant or foodservice
business. Furthermore, going out to a restaurant is the number one preferred activity for spending time with family and
friends (Restaurants Canada, 2014a).

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 77

Food and Beverage Sector Performance

Figure 4.1. Foodservice spending as a percentage of total food dollars spent in Canada and the US [Long
Description]

Look at Figure 4.1, which illustrates the percentage of total food dollars spent in restaurants in Canada and the United
States over several years. As you can see, Americans spend significantly more of their total food dollars in foodservice
establishments than in grocery stores, and in Canada we spend more of our total food dollars in the grocery store than
we do in foodservice operations. It’s worth noting that Americans do not have an equivalent federal sales tax on meals
comparable to our GST on foodservice sales, although there does exist in some states a sales tax on meals and alcoholic
beverages (State Sales Tax Rates, 2015). This, combined with a larger population, cheaper food distribution costs, and
other factors can often mean that it’s less expensive to dine out in the United States than in Canada.
For a perspective on how sales are distributed across the country by province, and how different foodservice operations
perform in terms of revenue (sales dollars collected from guests), look at Tables 4.1 and 4.2.

Table 4.1 shows that the independents in BC have a much larger share of the total number of units compared with
chains than any other province except Quebec. In terms of sales (Table 4.2), Ontario is the leader with almost $21
billion. Quebec, BC, and Alberta each earned $8 to $10 billion, and the other provinces had sales of less than $2
billion apiece. While BC and Alberta are almost even in total sales, BC has a third more units (restaurants), leading to
lower average sales per unit.
Foodservice sales in Alberta rose by a solid 6.4% in 2013. Alberta boasts the highest average unit volume at $828,860
per year, more than $200,000 over the national average due to greater disposable income and no provincial sales tax on
Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 79

meals. In BC, the end of the HST (harmonized sales tax) and improved economic growth lifted total foodservice sales by
a healthy 6.1% for the strongest annual growth since 2006 (Restaurants Canada, 2014a).
Now let’s take a quick look at which provinces have the most profitable foodservice operations.

Figure 4.2 Pre-tax profit margins. [Long Description]

Figure 4.2 indicates the profit margins per province. Profit is the amount left when expenses (including corporate
income tax) are subtracted from sales revenue. A higher profit margin means that a greater percentage of sales is
retained by the business owner, and a lower percentage is lost to operating and other costs.
The provincial variations in total sales and profit margins are due to several factors including:
• Relative level of economic activity
• Minimum wage levels
• Provincial sales taxes
• Cultural differences
• Weather
• Municipal taxes
• Percentage of market held by chains versus independents
• Number of units (restaurants)
• Density of units relative to local population
• Number of tourists or business travellers
Now that we have a sense of the relative performance of F&B operations by province, and some influences on success,
let’s delve a little deeper into the sector.

Types of Food and Beverage Providers

Figure 4.3 The Keg at the Station is in a former train
station in New Westminster, BC

While there are many ways to analyze the sector, in this chapter, we take a market-based, business-operation
approach based on the overall Canadian market share from the Restaurants Canada Market Review and Forecast
(Restaurants Canada, 2014b). The following sections explore the types of foodservice operations in Canada.
There are two key distinctions: commercial foodservice, which comprises operations whose primary business is food
and beverage, and non-commercial foodservice establishments where food and beverages are served, but are not the
primary business.
Let’s start with the largest segment of F&B operations, the commercial sector.

Commercial Operators
Commercial operators make up the largest segment of F&B in Canada with just over 80% market share (Restaurants
Canada, 2014b). It is made up of quick-service restaurants, full-service restaurants, catering, and drinking
establishments. Let’s look at each of these in more detail.

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 81

Quick-Service Restaurants
Formerly known as fast-food restaurants, quick-service restaurants, or QSRs, make up 35.4% of total food sales in
Canada (Restaurants Canada, 2014b). This prominent portion of the food sector generally caters to both residents and
visitors, and is represented in areas that are conveniently accessed by both. Brands, chains, and franchises dominate the
QSR landscape. While the sector has made steps to move away from the traditional fast-food image and style of service,
it is still dominated by both fast food and food fast; in other words, food that is prepared and purchased quickly, and
generally consumed quickly.

Take a Closer Look: The First McDonald’s In Canada
The first McDonald’s restaurant in Canada opened in Richmond, BC, in 1967. Located on No. 3 Road, it
featured a sleek almost space-age design. To see a picture of the location, visit McDonald’s: Then and Now:
www.richmond.ca/cityhall/archives/exhibits/thenandnow/then_now_set_7.htm

Convenience and familiarity is key in this sector. Examples of QSRs include:
• Drive-through locations
• Stand-alone locations
• Locations within retail stores
• Kiosk locations
• High-traffic areas, such as major highways or commuter routes

Full-Service Restaurants
With 35% of the market share (Restaurants Canada, 2014b), full-service restaurants are perhaps the most fluid of the
F&B operation types, adjusting and changing to the demands of the marketplace. Consumer expectations are higher
here than with QSRs (Parsa, Lord, Putrevu, & Kreeger, 2015). The menus offered are varied, but in general reflect the
image of the restaurant or consumer’s desired experience. Major segments include fine dining, family/casual, ethnic,
and upscale casual.

Figure 4.4 A rhubarb pavlova with local Pemberton
strawberries is served at Araxi Restaurant + Bar, a fine dining
establishment in Whistler.
82 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

Fine dining restaurants are characterized by highly trained chefs preparing complex food items, exquisitely presented.
Meals are brought to the table by experienced servers with sound food and beverage knowledge in an upscale
atmosphere with table linens, fine china, crystal stemware, and silver-plate cutlery. The table is often embellished with
fresh flowers and candles. In these businesses, the average cheque, which is the total sales divided by number of guests
served, is quite high (often reviewed with the cost symbols of three or four dollar signs- $ $ $ or $ $ $ $).
Bishop’s in Vancouver is one of BC’s best known and longest operating fine dining restaurants. Since opening in 1985,
this 45-seat restaurant has served heads of state including Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, and has won awards including
the Best of Vancouver. John Bishop was awarded the Governor General’s Award in 2010 (Georgia Straight, 2015).
Family/casual restaurants are characterized by being open for all three meal periods. These operations offer affordable
menu items that span a variety of customer tastes. They also have the operational flexibility in menu and restaurant
layout to welcome large groups of diners. An analysis of menus in family/casual restaurants reveals a high degree of
operational techniques such as menu item cross-utilization, where a few key ingredients are repurposed in several
ways. Both chain and independent restaurant operators flourish in this sector. Popular chain examples in BC include
White Spot, Ricky’s All Day Grill, Boston Pizza, and The Old Spaghetti Factory. Independents include the Red Wagon Café
in Vancouver, the Bon Voyage Restaurant near Prince George, and John’s Place in Victoria.

Figure 4.5 This is the interior of the Old Spaghetti Factory, a popular family chain,
in Gastown, Vancouver. This location opened in 1970 and has stood the test of time.

Ethnic restaurants typically reflect the owner’s cultural identity. While these restaurants are popular with many
markets, they are often particularly of interest to visitors and new immigrants looking for a specific environment and
other people with whom they have a shared culture. Food is often the medium for this sense of belonging (Koc &
Welsh, 2001; Laroche, Kim, Tomiuk, & Belisle, 2005).

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 83

Figure 4.6 The exterior of Vij’s, the flagship restaurant of Vikram Vij’s ethnic
dining legacy

The growth and changing nature of this sector reflects the acceptance of various ethnic foods within our
communities. Ethnic restaurants generally evolve along two routes: toward remaining authentic to the cuisine of the
country of origin, or toward larger market acceptance through modifying menu items (Mak, Lumbers, Eves, & Chang,
2012).
Upscale casual restaurants emerged in the 1970s, evolving out of a change in social norms. Consumers began to want
the experience of a fun social evening at a restaurant with good value (but not cheap), in contrast to the perceived
stuffiness of fine dining at that time. These restaurants are typically dinner houses, but they may open for lunch or
brunch depending on location. Examples in BC include the Keg, Earls, Cactus Club, Brown’s Social House, and Joey
Restaurants.

Catering and Banqueting
Catering makes up only 6.8% of the total share of F&B in Canada (Restaurants Canada, 2014b) and comprises food
served by catering companies at banquets and special events at a diverse set of venues. Note that banqueting pertains
to catered food served on premise, while catering typically refers to off-premise service. At a catered event,
customers typically eat at the same time, as opposed to restaurant customers who are served individually or in small
groups.
Catering businesses (whether on-site or at special locations) are challenged by the episodic nature of events, and the
issues of food handling and food safety with large groups. Catering businesses include:
• Catering companies
• Conference centres
• Conference hotels
• Wedding venues
• Festival food coordinators

84 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

Spotlight On: Diner en Blanc
An interesting public event with a dining focus is Diner en Blanc, which is held in cities around the globe
including Vancouver and Victoria. Diners wear all white and bring their table, chair, and place settings with
them to a secret location announced only hours before. Participants have the option to bring their own food
or purchase a catered meal. Alcoholic beverages are also available for purchase on site. For more information,
visit the Diner en Blanc website: http://vancouver.dinerenblanc.info/media

Figure 4.7 Diner en Blanc Vancouver’s first event at Jack Poole Plaza

While beverages make up part of almost every dining experience, some establishments are founded on beverage sales.
Let’s look at these operations next.

Drinking
With 3.5% market share (Restaurants Canada, 2014b), the drinking establishment sector comprises bars, wine bars,
cabarets, nightclubs, and pubs. In British Columbia, all businesses and premises selling alcohol must adhere to the BC
Liquor Control and Licensing Act. At the time this chapter was written, significant changes were taking place in the
regulations governing drinking establishments, but some general conditions have remained stable.
In BC, liquor licences are divided into liquor primary and food primary. As the name suggests, a liquor primary licence
is needed to operate a business that is in the primary business of selling alcohol. Most pubs, nightclubs, and cabarets
fall into this category. A food primary licence is required for an operation whose primary business is serving food. Some

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 85

operations, such as pubs, will hold a liquor primary licence even though they serve a significant volume of food. In this
case, the licence allows for diverse patronage.
One noteworthy change to the licensing of pubs in BC is that children are permitted in them if they are accompanied and
attended by responsible adults. While not universally adopted by pubs to date, this change in legislation is an example
of the fluctuating social norms to which the sector must respond.

Figure 4.8 The Six Mile Pub in Victoria, established in 1855, British Columbia’s oldest public
house

Together the commercial ventures of QSRs, full-service restaurants, catering functions, and drinking establishments
make up just over 80% of the market share. Now let’s look at the other 20% of businesses, which fall under the noncommercial umbrella.

Non-Commercial
The following non-commercial entities earn just under 20% share of the foodservice earnings in Canada (Restaurants
Canada, 2014b). While these make up a smaller share of the market, there are some advantages inherent in these
business models. Non-commercial operations cater predominantly to consumers with limited selection or choice given
their occupation or location. This type of consumer is often referred to as a captured patron. In a tourism capacity
such as in airports or on cruise ships, the accepted price point for these patrons is often higher for a given product,
increasing profit margins.

Institutional
Often run under a predetermined contract, this sector includes:
86 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

• Hospitals
• Universities, colleges, and other educational institutions
• Prisons and other detention facilities
• Corporate staff cafeterias
• Cruise ships
• Airports and other transportation terminals and operations

Accommodation Foodservice
These include hotel restaurants and bars, room service, and self-serve dining operations (such as a breakfast room).
Hotel restaurants are usually open to the public and reliant on this public patronage in addition to business from hotel
guests. Collaborations between hotel chains and restaurant chains have seen reliable pairing of hotels and restaurants,
such as the combination of Sandman Hotels and Moxie’s Grill and Bar.

Vending and Automated Foodservices
While not generally viewed as part of the food and beverage sector, automated and vending services do account for
significant sales for both small and large foodservice and accommodation providers. Vending machines are located in
motels, hotels, transportation terminals, sporting venues, or just about any location that will allow for the opportunity
for an impulse or convenient purchase.

Business Performance for Types of Food and Beverage Operators

Figure 4.9 Share of market for different restaurant segments [Long Description]

As mentioned, the commercial sector comprises the majority of dollars earned. Figure 4.9 illustrates the difference
between share of traffic and share of dollars for each subsector. We know that QSRs are much more economical and
Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 87

generally much busier than full-service restaurants. How does that traffic and low prices translate into market share for
the different segments?
Figure 4.9 shows that QSRs attract two-thirds of all the traffic, while earning less than half of the total dollars. Family/
midscale and casual dining each attract half the dollars of QSR, but they do that from much lower shares of the traffic.
Meanwhile fine dining is patronized by less than 1% of the total restaurant traffic, but earns 4.2% of the dollars. The
growing force of convenience stores, department stores, and other retail establishments obtain a respectable 11.5% of
traffic and 10.6% of the restaurant dollar.
As you can see, while QSRs attract the greatest number of guests, the ratio of dollars earned per transaction is
significantly less than that of the fine dining sector. This makes sense, of course, because the typical QSR earns relatively
little per guest but attracts hundreds of customers, while a fine dining restaurant charges high prices and serves a select
few guests each day.

The sales revenues for the various segments are shown in Table 4.3. Note that QSRs and full-service restaurants are
almost equal in their sales and almost completely dwarf the other commercial sectors of caterers and drinking places.
It is also noteworthy that the commercial components have four times the sales volume of the non-commercial
components.

Types of Food and Beverage Customers
Now that we’ve classified the sector based on business type and looked at relative performance, let’s look at F&B from

88 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

another perspective: customer type. The first way to classify customers is to divide them into two key markets: residents
and visitors.
The first of these, the resident group, can be further divided based on their purpose for visiting an F&B operator. For
one group, food or drink is the primary purpose for the visit. For example, think of a group of friends getting together
at a local restaurant to experience their signature sandwich. For another group, food and drink is the secondary
purpose, added spontaneously or as an ancillary activity. For example, think of time-crunched parents whisking their
kids through a drive-through on their way from one after-school activity to the next. Here the food and beverage
providers offer an expedient way to access a meal.

Figure 4.10 A visitor to Nanaimo eats a signature “Nanaimo bar” in front of a Nanaimo bar,
the Jingle Pot Pub

Foodservice providers also service the visitor market, which presents unique challenges as guests will bring with them
the tastes and eating habits of their home country or region. Most establishments generally follow one of two directions.
One is to cater completely to visitors from the day the doors open, with an operational and market focus on tourists.
The other is to cater primarily to residents.
Sometimes a local foodservice provider can continue to cater to the resident market over time. In other cases, often
because of financial pressures, the business shifts its focus away from the residents to better cater to visitors’ tastes.
These changes, when they do occur, generally happen over time and can lead to questions of authenticity of the local
offerings (Smart, 2003; Heroux, 2002; Mak, Lumbers, Eves, & Chang, 2012).

Take a Closer Look: The Science of Addictive Food
For some time, one secret recipe for success in the food sector, particularly the fast-food portion of the

It is clear that the food and beverage sector must remain responsive to consumers’ needs and desires. This is made
evident by the emergence of health-concious eating in North America over the last two decades. The influence of books
such as Fast Food Nation (Schlosser, 2012) and documentaries such as Super Size Me have created mainstream awareness
about what goes into our food and our bodies. As many developed nations, including Canada, struggle with health-care
concerns including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, food operators are taking note and developing new healthconscious menus. Programs like BC’s Informed Dining initiative are helping consumers understand their options (see
the Spotlight On below).

Spotlight On: Informed Dining
The Informed Dining program was created by Healthy Families BC to help consumers gain a better
understanding of the ingredients in their food and their role in daily healthy eating habits and guidelines. For
more information, visit the Informed Dining webpage: www.healthyfamiliesbc.ca/home/informed-dining

This awareness, coupled with an increasing interest and desire for more authentic foods produced without using
herbicides and pesticides, free of genetically modified ingredients, and even free of carbohydrates or gluten, has placed
pressure on the sector to respond, and many have (Frash, DiPietro, & Smith, 2014). Consumers are more aware of the
plight of farmers and producers from faraway places and the support for fair trade practices. At the same time, there
is a heightened desire for more locally grown products, and a general awareness of nutrition and the quality of products
that are harvested in season and closer to home.

Take a Closer Look: Cittaslow Designation for Cowichan Bay
The community of Cowichan Bay on Vancouver Island was awarded the Cittaslow Designation, which helps
acknowledge its focus on sustainable practices and local food harvesting best practice. For more information
on the designation and community efforts, watch the video, Cittaslow Cowichan Bay: www.youtube.com/
watch?v=_JQ-Cnh-v5Q

Consumer consciousness regarding the source and distribution of food has created a movement that champions
sustainable and locally grown foods. While this trend does have its extremes, it is founded on the premise that eating
food that has been produced nearby leads to better food quality, sustainable food production processes, and increased
enjoyment. This has led to a number of restaurants that incorporate these concepts in their menu planning and
marketing.
In addition to this trend toward “conscious consumerism” (LinkBC, 2014, p.4), F&B professionals must be highly aware of
the importance of special diets including gluten-free, low-carb, and other dietary restrictions (LinkBC, 2014).
90 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

All of these influences are continuously shaping the food and beverage sector. Before we explore additional trends and
issues in the sector, let’s review the core considerations for profitability in foodservice operations.

Figure 4.11 Officials announce more funding for BC farmers
markets, which have become increasingly popular due to
changing consumer tastes

Profitability
While many factors influence the profitability of foodservice operations, key considerations include type of business,
location, cost control and profit margin, sales and marketing strategies, and human resources management. We’ve
already examined the different types of operation, and their relative profit margins. Let’s look at the other profitability
considerations in more detail.

Location
The selection of the correct location for a restaurant is often cited as the most critical factor in an operation’s success (or
failure) in terms of profitability. Prior to opening, site analysis is required to determine the amount of traffic (foot traffic
and vehicle traffic), proximity to competing businesses, visibility to patrons, accessibility, and presence (or absence) of
desired patrons (Ontario Restaurant News, 1995).

Cost Control
According to Restaurants Canada, QSRs have the highest profit margin at 5.1%, while full-service restaurants have a
margin of 3.5%. There will be significant variances from these percentages at individual locations even within the same
brand (2014b).

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 91

Figure 4.12 Operating ratios for Canadian food and beverage businesses in 2012 [Long
Description]

A number of costs influence the profitability of an F&B operation. Some of the key operating expenses (as a percentage
of revenue) are detailed in Figure 4.12, above, where food cost and salaries & wages are the two major expenses,
each accounting for approximately a third of the total. Other expenses include rental and leasing of venue, utilities,
advertising, and depreciation of assets. These percentages represent averages, and will vary greatly by sector and
location.
Cost control and containment is essential for all F&B businesses. Demanding particular attention are the labour, food,
and beverage costs, also known as the operator’s primary costs. In addition to these big ticket items, there is the cost
of reusable operating supplies such as cutlery, glassware, china, and linen in full-service restaurants.
Given that most operations have both a service side (interacting directly with the consumer) and production side
(preparing food or drink to be consumed), the primary costs incurred during these activities often determine the
feasibility or success of the operation. This is especially true as the main product (e.g., food and drink) is
perishable; ordering the correct amount requires skill and experience.

Sales and Marketing
The two principal considerations for sales and marketing in this sector are market share and revenue maximization.
Most F&B operations are constrained by finite time and space, so management must constantly seek ways to increase
revenue from the existing operation, or increase the share of the available market. Examples of revenue maximization
include upselling existing consumers (e.g., asking if they want fries with their meal; offering dessert), and using outdoor
or patio space (even using rain covers and heaters to extend the outdoor season). Examples of increasing market share
in the fast-food sector include extending special offers to new, first-time customers through social media or targeted
direct mail.
In today’s cluttered marketplace, being noticed is a constant goal for most companies. Converting that awareness into
patronage is a challenge for most operators. Restaurant reviews have been a part of the food and beverage sector for a
long time. With the increase of online reviews by customers at sites like Yelp, Urbanspoon, and TripAdvisor, and sharing
of experiences via social media, food and beverage operators are becoming increasingly aware of their web presence
(Kwok & Yu, 2013). For this reason, all major food and beverage operators carefully monitor their online reputation and
their social media presence.

Take a Closer Look: McDonald’s Social Media Conversation
In 2014, McDonald’s Restaurants took to the internet to answer questions about their food production and
ingredients. After months of declining sales, their strategy was to create more emotional engagement with
customers and to gain their trust (Passikoff, 2014). To read more about the initiative, read the article in
Forbes magazine, “McDonald’s Hopes New Social Media Question-And-Answer Will Modify Food Image”:
www.forbes.com/sites/robertpassikoff/2014/10/14/mcdonalds-hopes-new-social-media-qa-will-modifyfood-image/

One of the keys to a strong reputation, both in person, and online, is the management of human resources.

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 93

Staffing and Human Resources

Figure 4.13 Winner of Top Chef Canada Matthew Stowe and patron at a new Cactus Club
restaurant opening

Appropriately staffing an F&B operation involves attracting the right people, hiring them, training them, and then
assigning them to the right tasks for their skills and abilities. Many businesses operate outside the traditional workweek
hours; indeed, some operate on a 24-hour schedule. Creating the right team, employing them in accordance with legal
guidelines, and keeping up with the demands of the businesses are challenges that can be addressed by a well-thoughtout and implemented human resources plan.
People who have long-lasting careers in the sector find the fluctuating conditions appealing; no two days are the same,
and the fast-paced and energetic social environment can be motivating. Many positions provide meaningful rewards
and compensation that can lead to long-term careers.
One topic of discussion in food and beverage human resources is that of gratuities (tipping). In Canada, restaurants are
obligated to pay staff minimum wage, and gratuities are paid by the customer as an expression of their gratitude for
service. This is not the model in countries like Australia, where service staff are paid a higher professional wage and
prices are raised to accommodate this.

Take a Closer Look: Tipping and Its Alternatives
In 2008, Michael Lynn and Glenn Withiam wrote a paper discussing the role of tipping and potential
alternatives. While the paper focuses particularly on the United States (where wages are structured
differently from Canada), it raises some good questions about consumer preference and impact on
businesses (Lynn & Withiam, 2008). For instance, do tips actually improve service? These questions can

94 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

apply to food and beverage businesses but also other tourism operations within the service context. It
also offers some suggestions for further research. Read this paper at “Tipping and Its Alternatives”:
http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=articles

In British Columbia, tips are considered income for tax purposes but are not considered wages as they are not paid by
the employer to the employee. A restaurant owner cannot use tips to cover business expenses (e.g., require an employee
to use his or her tips to cover the cost of broken glassware). Employers are also not permitted to charge staff for the
cost of diners who do not pay (known as a dine-and-dash). They can, however, require front-of-house staff pool their
gratuities, or pay individually, to ensure back-of-house staff receive a percentage of the tips (British Columbia Ministry
of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training, n.d.). This is also commonly known as a tip-out.
There have been experiments with gratuity models in recent years. One example is a restaurant on Vancouver Island,
which tried an all-inclusive pricing model upon opening in 2014, but reverted three months later to the traditional
tipping model due to consumer demand and resistance to higher prices (Duffy, 2014).

Trends and Issues
In addition to having to focus on the changing needs of guests and the specific challenges of their own businesses, food
and beverage operators must deal with trends and issues that affect the entire industry. Let’s take a closer look at these.

Government Influence
Each level of government affects the sector in different ways. The federal government and its agencies have influence
through income tax rates, costs of employee benefits (e.g., employer share of Canada Pension Plan and Employment
Insurance deductions), and support for specific agricultural producers such as Canadian dairy and poultry farmers,
which can lead to an increase in the price of ingredients such as milk, cheese, butter, eggs, and chicken compared to US
prices (Findlay, 2014; Chapman, 1994).
Provincial governments also impact the food and beverage sector, in particular with respect to employment standards;
minimum wage; sales taxes (except Alberta); liquor, wine, and beer wholesale pricing (Smith, 2015); and corporate
income tax rates.
Municipal governments have an ever-increasing impact through property and business taxes, non-smoking bylaws,
zoning and bylaw restrictions, user fees, and operating hours restrictions.

Spotlight On: Restaurants Canada
When Restaurants Canada was founded in 1944, it was known as the Canadian Restaurant Association, and
later the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association. Today, the organization represents over 30,000

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 95

operations including restaurants, bars, caterers, institutions, and suppliers. It conducts and circulates
industry research and offers its members cost savings on supplies, insurance, and other business expenses.
For more information, visit the Restaurants Canada website: www.restaurantscanada.org

Over time, the consequence of these government impacts has resulted in independent and chain operators alike joining
forces to create a national restaurant and foodservice association now named Restaurants Canada (see Spotlight
On above). At the provincial level, BC operators rely on the British Columbia Restaurant & Foodservices Association
(BCRFA).

Spotlight On: BC Restaurant & Foodservices Association (BCRFA)
For more than 40 years, the BCRFA has represented the interests of the province’s foodservice operators in
matters such as wages, benefits, liquor licences and other relevant matters. Today, it offers benefits to over
3,000 members on both the supply and the operator side. For more information, visit the BC Restaurant and
Foodservices Association website: http://bcrfa.com

Health and Safety

Figure 4.14 A sign in a Starbucks location encouraging staff to wash their hands to prevent
the spread of germs

Food and beverage providers hold a distinct position within our society; they invite the public to consume their
offerings, both on and off premise. In doing so, all food and beverage operators must adhere to standardized public
safety regulations. Each province has regulations and legislation that apply in their jurisdiction. In BC, this is addressed

96 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

by the FoodSafe and Serving It Right programs, and compliance with the Occupiers Liability Act. These regulations and
legislation are enacted in the interest of public health and safety.

Take a Closer Look: Health and Safety Training
Food and beverage professionals are strongly encouraged to take both FoodSafe and Serving It Right courses.
These certifications are necessary to advance into specific and leadership roles in the industry. For instance,
Serving It Right is required by all licensees, managers, sales staff, and servers in licensed establishments.
In addition, individuals may require Serving It Right for a special occasion licence. To sign up for an online
program or course near you, visit FoodSafe: www.foodsafe.ca and Serving It Right: www.servingitright.com

FoodSafe is the provincial food safety training program designed for the foodservice industry (FoodSafe, 2009). Serving
It Right is a mandatory course that is completed through self-study, and is required for anyone serving alcohol in a
commercial setting. Its goal is to ensure that licensees, managers, and servers know their legal responsibilities and
understand techniques to prevent over-service and related issues (go2HR, 2014).
In broad terms, BC’s Occupiers Liability Act covers the responsibilities of the occupier of a property to ensure the safety
of visitors. Additional local health bylaws set standards of operation for health and safety under the direction of the
medical officers of health. Public health inspectors regularly visit food and beverage operations to evaluate compliance.
In some communities, these inspection results are posted online.
Collectively, the food and beverage industry in BC has an excellent reputation for ensuring the health and safety of its
patrons, the general public, and its employees.

Technology Trends
Technology continues to play an ever-increasing role in the sector. It is most noticeable in QSRs where many functions
are automated in both the front of house and back of house. In the kitchen, temperature sensors and alarms determine
when fries are ready and notify kitchen staff. Out front, remote printers or special screens ensure the kitchen is
immediately notified when a server rings in a purchase. WiFi enables credit/debit card hand-held devices to be brought
directly to the table to process transactions, saving steps back to the serving station.
Other trends include automated services such as that offered by Open Table, which provides restaurants with an
online real-time restaurant reservation system so customers can make reservations without speaking to anyone at the
restaurant (Open Table, 2015). And now smartphone apps will tell customers what restaurants are nearby or where their
favourite chain restaurant is located.

Take a Closer Look: Automated Cooking in Asia
In Singapore Changi Airport, a quick-service restaurant is using automated woks. The cook adds the
ingredients and can attend to other duties until the item is ready for service. Check out a video of a cook

Changing Venues
The following trends relate to the changing nature of food and beverage venues, including the emerging importance of
the third space, and the increased mainstream presence of non-permanent locations such as street vendors and pop-up
restaurants.

The Third Space
The third space is a concept that describes locations where customers congregate that are neither home (the first
space) nor work or school (the second space). Many attribute the emergence of these spaces to the popularity of coffee
shops such as Starbucks. In the third space, operators must create a comfortable venue for customers to “hang out”
with comfortable seating, grab and go F&B options, WiFi, and a relaxed ambiance. Providing these components has been
shown as a way to increase traffic and customer loyalty (Mogelonski, 2014).

Taking It to the Street
Street food has always been a component of the foodservice industry in most big cities. These operations are often
run by a single owner/operator or with minimal staff, and serve hot food that can be eaten while standing. According
to research firm IBISWorld, in 2011 the “street food business — which includes mobile food trucks and non mechanized
carts, is a $1 billion industry that has seen an 8.4 percent growth rate from 2007 to 2012″ (Entrepreneur, 2011) with 78%
of owners having no more than four employees.
Recently, in North America, where climate and weather allow, there has been a noticeable increase in both the number
and type of street food vendors. In the city of Vancouver alone there are over 100 permitted food cart businesses,
searchable by an app and sortable list — and the city uses the terms street food vendor, food cart, and food truck
interchangeably (City of Vancouver, 2014).

98 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

Figure 4.15 Tacofino (closest), Pig on the Street, and Mom’s Grilled Cheese food trucks welcome crowds
to their portable kitchens in downtown Vancouver.

Pop-up restaurants have also emerged, facilitated in part by the prevalent use of social media for marketing and location
identification. Pop-ups are temporary restaurants with a known expiry date, which also tend to have the following in
common (Knox, 2011):
• A well-known or up-and-coming chef at the helm
• An interesting, but stationary, location (a warehouse, a park, the more unusual the better)
• Staff who are adept at promotions and word-of-mouth
• Strong local foodie (food and beverage enthusiast) base in the area
• Involvement from local artists or musicians to add to the experience
As popular they are with consumers, the ways in which pop-ups deviate from restaurants has aggravated some
critics, causing Bon Appétit magazine to declare that “pop-ups are not supposed to be restaurants,” and that “pop-up
restaurants are over” (Duckor, 2013). Statements like these are further evidence that food and beverage services trends
are dynamic and ever-changing.

Conclusion
The food and beverage sector is a vibrant and multifaceted part of our society. Michael Hurst, famous restaurateur and
former chair of the US National Restaurant Association, championed the idea that all guests should be received with the
statement “Glad you are here” (Tripp, 1992; Marshall 2001). That statement is the perfect embodiment of what F&B is to

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 99

the hospitality industry — a mix of service providers who welcome guests with open arms and take care of their most
basic needs, as well as their emotional well-being.

Take a Closer Look: Michael Hurst
Michael Hurst preached to students, industry participants, and university colleagues alike, saying that
“The most precious gift you can give your Guests is the gift of Friendship” (Tripp, 1992; Marshall 2001).

The social fabric of our country, its residents, and visitors will change over time, and so too will F&B. What will not
change in spite of how we divide the segments — into tourists or locals — is that the sector is at its best when food and
beverages are accompanied by a social element, extending from your dining companions to the front and back of the
house.
So far, we have covered the transportation, accommodation, and food and beverage sectors. In the next two chapters,

Case Study: Restaurant Behaviour – Then and Now

The following story made the rounds via social media in late 2014. While the claim has not been verified, it
certainly rings true for a number of F&B professionals who have experienced this phenomenon. The story is as
follows:
A busy New York City restaurant kept getting bad reviews for slow service, so they hired a firm to investigate.
When they compared footage from 2004 to footage from 2014, they made some pretty startling discoveries. So
shocking, in fact, that they ranted about it in an anonymous post on Craigslist:
We are a popular restaurant for both locals and tourists alike. Having been in business for many years, we
noticed that although the number of customers we serve on a daily basis is almost the same as ten years
ago, the service seems very slow. One of the most common complaints on review sites against us and
many restaurants in the area is that the service was slow and/or they needed to wait too long for a table.
We’ve added more staff and cut back on the menu items but we just haven’t been able to figure it out.
We hired a firm to help us solve this mystery, and naturally the first thing they blamed it on was the

102 | Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services

employees needing more training and the kitchen staff not being up to the task of serving that many
customers.
Like most restaurants in NYC we have a surveillance system, and unlike today where it’s digital, 10 years
ago we still used special high capacity tapes to record all activity. At any given time we had 4 special Sony
systems recording multiple cameras. We would store the footage for 90 days just in case we needed it
for something.
The investigators suggested we locate some of the older tapes and analyze how the staff behaved
ten years ago versus how they behave now. We went down to our storage room but we couldn’t find any
tapes at all.
We did find the recording devices, and luckily for us, each device has 1 tape in it that we simply never
removed when we upgraded to the new digital system!
The date stamp on the old footage was Thursday July 1, 2004. The restaurant was very busy that day. We
loaded up the footage on a large monitor, and next to it on a separate monitor loaded up the footage of
Thursday July 3 2014, with roughly the same amount of customers as ten years before.
We carefully looked at over 45 transactions in order to determine what has been happening:
Here’s a typical transaction from 2004:
Customers walk in. They are seated and are given menus. Out of 45 customers 3 request to be seated
elsewhere.
Customers spend 8 minutes on average before closing the menu to show they are ready to order.
Waiters shows up almost instantly and takes the order.
Appetizers are fired within 6 minutes; obviously the more complex items take longer.
Out of 45 customers 2 sent their items back.
Waiters keep an eye on their tables so they can respond quickly if the customer needs something.
After guests are done, the check is delivered, and within 5 minutes they leave.
Average time from start to finish: 1 hour, 5 minutes.
Here’s what happened in 2014:
Customers walk in. Customers get seated and are given menus, and out of 45 customers 18 request to be
seated elsewhere.
Before even opening the menu most customers take their phones out, some are taking photos while
others are texting or browsing.
Seven of the 45 customers had waiters come over right away, they showed them something on their
phone and spent an average of five minutes of the waiter’s time. Given this is recent footage, we asked
the waiters about this and they explained those customers had a problem connecting to the WIFI and
demanded the waiters try to help them.
After a few minutes of letting the customers review the menu, waiters return to their tables. The majority
of customers have not even opened their menus and ask the waiter to wait a bit.
When customers do open their menus, many place their phones on top and continue using their
activities.

Chapter 4. Food and Beverage Services | 103

Waiters return to see if they are ready to order or have any questions. Most customers ask for more time.
Finally a table is ready to order. Total average time from when a customer is seated until they place their
order is 21 minutes.
Food starts getting delivered within 6 minutes; obviously the more complex items take way longer.
26 out of 45 customers spend an average of 3 minutes taking photos of the food.
14 out of 45 customers take pictures of each other with the food in front of them or as they are eating the
food. This takes on average another 4 minutes as they must review and sometimes retake the photo.
9 out of 45 customers sent their food back to reheat. Obviously if they didn’t pause to do whatever on
their phone the food wouldn’t have gotten cold.
27 out of 45 customers asked their waiter to take a group photo. 14 of those requested the waiter retake
the photo as they were not pleased with the first photo. On average this entire process between the chit
chatting and reviewing the photo taken added another 5 minutes and obviously caused the waiter not to
be able to take care of other tables he/she was serving.
Given in most cases the customers are constantly busy on their phones it took an average of 20 more
minutes from when they were done eating until they requested a check.
Furthermore once the check was delivered it took 15 minutes longer than 10 years ago for them to pay
and leave.
8 out of 45 customers bumped into other customers or in one case a waiter (texting while walking) as
they were either walking in or out of the restaurant.
Average time from start to finish: 1:55
We are grateful for everyone who comes into our restaurant, after all there are so many choices out
there. But can you please be a bit more considerate?
Now it’s your turn. Imagine you are the restaurant operator in question, and answer the questions below.
1. What could you, as the owner, try to do to improve the turnover time? Come up with at least three ideas.
2. Now put yourself in the position of a server. Do your ideas still work from this perspective?
3. Lastly, look at your typical customer. How will he or she respond to your proposals?

DON WEBSTER

Learning Objectives

• Differentiate between recreation, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism, and nature-based tourism
• Describe the significance, size, and economic contribution of this sector to the overall tourism industry
in BC
• Identify key industry organizations in recreation, outdoor recreation, and adventure tourism
• Classify different subsectors of recreation, outdoor recreation, and adventure tourism
• Recognize the unique challenges facing recreation, outdoor recreation, and adventure tourism in BC

Overview
In this chapter, we discuss the concept of recreation in tourism and hospitality. Recreation can be defined as the pursuit
of leisure activities during one’s spare time (Tribe, 2011) and can include vastly different activities such as golfing, sport
fishing, and rock climbing. Defining recreation as it pertains to tourism, however, is more challenging.

Figure 5.1 Climbers in Squamish, BC

Let’s start by exploring some recreation-based terms that are common in the tourism industry. Outdoor recreation
Chapter 5. Recreation | 109

can be defined as “outdoor activities that take place in a natural setting, as opposed to a highly cultivated or managed
landscape such as a playing field or golf course” (Tourism BC, 2013, p. 47). This term is typically applied to outdoor
activities that individuals engage in and that are located close to their community. When these activities are further
away, and people must travel some distance to participate in them, they are often described as adventure tourism.
According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), adventure tourism is “a trip that includes at
least two of the following three elements: physical activity, natural environment, and cultural immersion” (UNWTO, 2014,
p.12). Examples of adventure tourism in BC include river rafting, helicopter skiing, and rock climbing.

Take a Closer Look: UNWTO Global Report
The Global Report on Adventure Tourism by UNWTO offers an in-depth analysis of the global adventure travel
sector. It can be found at http://affiliatemembers.unwto.org/publication/global-report-adventure-tourism

Adventure tourism can be “soft” or “hard.” Differentiating between the two is somewhat subjective, but is loosely based
on the level of experience required, the level of fitness required, and the degree to which the participant is exposed to
risk (UNWTO, 2014). Examples of soft adventure include wildlife viewing or moderate hiking, whereas river rafting or
rock climbing would usually be considered hard adventure.
Another term that is used, one that overlaps with the definitions of outdoor recreation and adventure tourism,
is nature-based tourism, which refers to “those tourism experiences that are directly or indirectly dependent on the
natural environment” (Tourism BC, 2005b, p.6). This term is often used to describe activities that are closely connected
to nature, such as whale watching, birding, or self-propelled travel such as hiking and kayaking.
As you can see, there are challenges in classifying recreation in tourism. For instance, if people kayak near their home
or community, it may be considered outdoor recreation. If they travel afar for that same activity, it likely is designated
as adventure tourism. If the kayaking is done in protected, mild conditions, it would be considered soft adventure, but if
done in a challenging and risky river descent, it may be classified as hard adventure.
Of course, each of the above scenarios of kayaking could be considered nature-based tourism if it is strongly linked
to the natural environment. Ultimately, categorization is based on a combination of several factors, including manner
of engagement in the activity (risk exposure, experience requirement, group or solo activity), the distance travelled to
access the activity, and the type of environment (proximity to nature, level of challenge involved) that that the activity
occurs in.
A 2013 adventure tourism market study discovered that people who travel for adventure experiences tend to be welleducated, with 48% holding a four-year degree or higher credential. They value natural beauty and rank this as the
highest factor when choosing a destination, and the most cited reasons for their travel are relaxation “relaxation,
exploring new places, time with family, and learning about different cultures” (UNWTO, 2014, p.15).
Globally, it is estimated that the continents of Europe, North America, and South America account for 69% of adventure
tourism, or US$263 billion in adventure travel spending. Adventure tourists tend to be seen as high-value visitors, with
as much of 70% of their expenditures remaining in the communities visited (UNWTO, 2014).
The size, extent, and economic contribution of recreation, outdoor recreation, and adventure tourism in British
Columbia is also substantial. The rest of this chapter explores the sector in the province in more detail.

110 | Chapter 5. Recreation

Recreation and Adventure Tourism in BC
Studies have shown that nearly all residents of BC partake in some kind of outdoor recreation activity during any given
year. Approximately 85% of those participants indicate that these recreational activities were very important to them
(Tourism BC, 2013).

Spotlight On: Outdoor Recreation Council of BC
The Outdoor Recreation Council of BC (ORC) describes itself as “promoting access to and responsible use
of BC’s public lands and waters for public outdoor recreation” (Outdoor Recreation Council of BC, 2014).
The Council promotes the benefits of outdoor recreation, represents the community to government and
the general public, advocates and educates about responsible land use, provides a forum for exchanging
information, and connects different outdoor recreation groups. For more information, visit the Outdoor
Recreation Council of BC website: http://orcbc.ca

Figure 5.2 Joffre Lake Provincial Park, where adventure tourists access secluded camping spots by
carrying (or boating) in their gear

It is estimated that there are approximately 2,200 outdoor/adventure tourism operators in BC. In 2001, this accounted
for 21,000 jobs and $556 million in direct wages. The last sector-wide study in 2005 estimated that business revenues in
outdoor adventure tourism accounted for approximately $854 million in annual business revenues (Tourism BC, 2013).
Given the growth of adventure tourism over the last decade, it is likely these numbers have risen.
Additionally, in the current five-year provincial tourism strategy, entitled Gaining the Edge, outdoor/adventure tourism
is indicated as one of six key areas targeted for growth (British Columbia Ministry of Jobs, Tourism and Innovation,
Chapter 5. Recreation | 111

2012). This government support, combined with the rapid growth of the outdoor and adventure tourism industry, point
to a strong future for this sector.

Take a Closer Look: Outdoor Adventure Sector Profile
Outdoor Adventure: Tourism Sector Profile, a report produced by Destination BC, includes information on the
size, type, and characteristics of tourism companies in this sector. Also included is market demand for these
activities and future challenges the sector faces. You can find the report at Outdoor Tourism Sector Profile
[PDF]: http://www.destinationbc.ca/getattachment/Research/Research-by-Activity/All-Sector-Profiles/
Outdoor-Adventure-Sector-Profile,-May-2014/Tourism-SectorProfile_OutdoorAdventure_May2014.pdf.aspx

This section covers two key types of recreation and tourism, with a focus on British Columbia:
1. Land-based recreation and tourism
2. Water-based recreation and tourism
It’s not possible to detail all the recreational activities available in BC, but by the end of this section, you will have an
understanding of the key unique activities available in the province.

Land-Based Recreation and Tourism
Golf Courses and Resorts
A 2009 economic impact study found that more than six million Canadians participate in the game of golf each year,
making this sport the number one outdoor recreational activity in Canada based on participation. Golf also directly
employs more than 155,000 people and contributes more than $11 billion directly to Canada’s gross domestic product.
BC has over 300 golf course facilities, and with over $2 billion annually in direct economic activity, the golfing industry
in the province is the fourth largest in Canada (Strategic Networks Inc., 2009).
Golf is a significant tourism attraction in BC; in 2007 the province was chosen as the “Best Golf Course Destination in
North America” by the International Association of Golf Tour Operators (Destination BC, 2014c). Part of the draw is the
diverse environment; golfers can choose from lush coastal forests to desert environments, and many courses have a
viewscape of mountains or the ocean.
A 2006 study by the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) detailed both demographic and economic factors related to
the Canadian golf industry. Significant findings included that there were more than 3.4 million golf travellers in Canada
annually, and that of those travellers, approximately 34% travelled to BC. In addition, the Canadian golf participation rate
(for the total Canadian population) was 21.5%, which is among the highest golf participation rates of any country in the
world. Golfing provides an opportunity to attract significant tourism revenue as the average golf traveller has a much
higher than average income level, with up to 50% of all golf travellers earning $100,000 or more per annum (Tourism BC,
2009b).

Spotlight On: British Columbia Golf Marketing Alliance
The British Columbia Golf Marketing Alliance is a strategic alliance that represents 58 regional and
destination golf resorts in BC. The purpose of the alliance is to grow the game of golf in BC and achieve
recognition nationally and internationally as a leading golf destination. The alliance supports and distributes
information about research, lobbying efforts, and golf industry events. For more information, visit the Allied
Golf Association of BC website: http://aga-bc.org/committees/recreational-golf-committee/

Mountain Resorts and Nordic Centres
Resorts in British Columbia range from smaller eco-lodges to large ski areas. Mountain resorts and nordic centres are
part of the larger resort tourism sector, which in 2004 was valued at $1.9 billion (Tourism BC, 2011c).

Figure 5.3 A man stands ready to ski down Blackcomb
mountain in Whistler, BC

Ski/Snowboard Mountain Resorts
BC’s many world-class facilities and high-quality snow conditions provide mass appeal for downhill skiing and
snowboarding. Mountain resorts in BC can be separated into two principal categories: destination resorts and regional
resorts. Destination mountain resorts are often significantly larger and offer a greater range of amenities such as
on mountain accommodation and food services; they are also generally marketed to out-of-area and international
visitors. Examples of a destination resort would include Whistler Blackcomb Ski Resort. On the other hand, regional
mountain resorts are usually smaller in size and capacity, have fewer amenities, and often cater more directly to the
local community (Tourism BC, 2011c) such as Whitewater Ski Resort in the Kootenay Rockies.

Chapter 5. Recreation | 113

Spotlight On: Canada West Ski Areas Association
Ski areas in Western Canada (Alberta and BC) are represented by the Canada West Ski Areas Association
(CWSAA), which has a diverse mandate that includes marketing, advocacy, environmental stewardship,
and risk management. For more information, visit the Canada West Ski Areas Association website:
http://www.cwsaa.org

The aggregate economic value of destination mountain resorts is significant; one study by Tourism BC found that 13 of
these resorts were responsible for generating approximately 1.1 billion in revenue, or 8% of the total provincial tourism
revenues in 2008. Additionally, they provided the equivalent of 14,267 full-time equivalent jobs (Tourism BC, 2011c).
Furthermore, BC’s top mountain resorts have received many prestigious awards (Tourism BC, 2011c, p. 11):
• Whistler Blackcomb has consistently been named the #1 ski resort in North America.
• In 2009, Sun Peaks was named one of the “Top 20 Ski Resorts in North America” by ?Condé Nast Traveler.
• Big White Ski Resort was recognized in 2009 as a “Top 5 Family Resort” by the UK-based Sunday Times.
The publicity that these resorts receive has undoubtedly reflected positively on the rest of the BC tourism industry.

Spotlight On: “Ski It to Believe It”
Destination BC offers a specific mountain resort marketing website for 13 destination resorts in BC called
“Ski It to Believe It.” The site features live updates on snow conditions, resort info, a map featuring all BC
ski destinations, blogs, and dynamic content featuring visitors enjoying various skiing experiences including
heli, cat, backcountry, and downhill skiing. For more information, visit the Ski It to Believe It website:
http://skiittobelieveit.com

Nordic Centres
Nordic skiing, also commonly known as cross-country skiing, is a low-risk, low-impact winter sport popular across
Canada. It differs from backcountry skiing in that participants ski on groomed trails typically maintained as part of an
established facility (Cross Country BC, n.d.).

Spotlight On: Whistler Sport Legacies
Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver and Whistler, there was much debate about the
need for a continuing legacy from the event. Whistler Sport Legacies is an example of a recreational, tourism,

114 | Chapter 5. Recreation

and sport legacy that can emerge out of a mega event such as the Olympics. For more information, visit the
Whistler Sport Legacies website: http://www.whistlersportlegacies.com

With more than 50 cross-country ski centres across BC, and a season that often exceeds that of downhill skiing
(November to May in many areas), the sport attracts large numbers of local and inbound recreation enthusiasts.
Trail networks have been developed in both stand-alone environments, as well as in partnership with large mountain
resorts such as Silver Star in Vernon, Sun Peaks in Kamloops, Cypress Mountain above Vancouver, and Rossland in the
Kootenays. Many of these trail networks offer both groomed and track-set trails, a number are lit for night skiing.

Spotlight On: Silver Star’s Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre
Located just outside Vernon, Sovereign Lake is Canada’s largest daily groomed trail network that includes 105
kilometres of trails varying from green (easy) to black diamond (most difficult); a further trail expansion is
planned for 2015. For more information, visit Sovereign Lake’s website: http://www.sovereignlake.com

Backcountry Skiing and Snowboarding
Backcountry skiing and snowboarding offers a recreational activity in a wilderness setting, away from any established
mountain resorts, lifts, or trails. BC is regarded as a world-class destination for backcountry access, and has recently
seen considerable and sustained growth in this sector (Porteus, 2013). The motivator for pursuing this activity for most
people is primarily the lure of fresh, untracked snow in a beautiful mountain setting. Some backcountry skiers and
snowboarders combine this activity with helicopter or snowcat skiing.

Spotlight On: Backcountry Lodges Association of British Columbia
The Backcountry Lodges Association of British Columbia (BLABC) represents backcountry lodges in the
province. Its consumer site features a find-a-lodge function, profiles for summer and winter lodges, the
ability to check conditions in various backcountry areas, and consumer content including a blog and videos.
For more information, visit the Backcountry Lodges Association of BC: www.backcountrylodgesof bc.com

Helicopter skiing transports skiers and snowboarders by helicopter to the backcountry. It is typically a professionally
guided activity, with packages ranging in duration from a single day to weeks. The skiing/snowboarding is often
packaged with a luxury lodge accommodation, gourmet meals, and access to spa treatments.
Heliskiing was pioneered in Canada by Swiss mountain guide Hans Gmoser, who founded the company Canadian
Mountain Holidays, which has grown to be the largest heliskiing company in the world (Canadian Mountain Holidays,

Chapter 5. Recreation | 115

n.d.). Today, there are close to 20 helicopter skiing companies in BC, which represents the largest concentration of
commercial operations in the world (HeliCat Canada, n.d.).
Snowcat skiing is alpine skiing accessed by travelling to the top of the ski area in a snowcat (an enclosed cab vehicle
on tracks). As with heliskiing, this activity also has its commercial roots in BC. Snowcat skiing was pioneered in 1975
by Selkirk Wilderness Skiing as an alternative to both lift-serviced and helicopter-accessed riding and skiing (Selkirk
Wilderness Skiing, n.d.). It is typically a guided activity due to the avalanche risk associated with the terrain. As with
heliskiing, snowcat skiers have the option of choosing single-day or multi-day vacation packages. During the winter of
2015, there were 11 established snowcat skiing operations in BC (HeliCat Canada, n.d.).

Spotlight On: Avalanche Canada
This organization provides public avalanche forecasts and education for any backcountry travellers venturing
into avalanche terrain. This vital service is provided to the public free of charge, as Avalanche Canada is
a not-for-profit society dedicated to a vision of eliminating avalanche injuries and fatalities in Canada. In
addition to the website, it provides training programs and shares safety best practice. For more information,
visit Avalance Canada: http://www.avalanche.ca

Guides for these operations are typically certified by either the Association of Canadian Mountain Guides (ACMG) or
the Canadian Ski Guide Association (CSGA). Both organizations assess the guides for their expertise in technical skills,
avalanche forecasting, risk management and emergency response before issuing certification. The process is extensive
and rigorous, taking much time and commitment for guides to become fully certified.

Spotlight On: HeliCat Canada
Based in Revelstoke, BC, HeliCat Canada is an industry organization that represents heliskiing and snowcat
skiing operators in Canada. It provides regulation, advocacy, and marketing for the operators. Since 1978, the
organization has worked closely with government and industry to develop operations guidelines. For more
information, visit Helicat Canada: www.helicatcanada.com

Off-Road Recreational Vehicles
An off-road recreational vehicle (ORV) is any vehicle designed to be driven off road that is not included within any other
vehicle classification framework. This includes snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and dirt bikes (British Columbia
Ministry of Forest, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, 2014). ORV use is recognized as a considerable contributor
to the BC economy, owing primarily to recreational users, but also from tourist visits.

116 | Chapter 5. Recreation

Figure 5.4 Snowmobiles ready for their riders near Golden, BC

Recreational snowmobiling in BC is represented by the British Columbia Snowmobile Federation (BCSF). The BCSF’s
mandate is to represent recreational snowmobile clubs through advocacy, education, and stewardship (BCSF,
n.d.). Commercial snowmobiling is represented by the British Columbia Commercial Snowmobile Operators Association
(BCCSOA), a group of snowmobile tour operators who have mobilized to support marketing, product development, and
government advocacy initiatives (BCCSOA, n.d.).
ORV use has long been the subject of conflict between non-motorized and motorized recreational users of the
wilderness. Non-motorized users claim that motorized users negatively impact the wilderness through noise pollution
and environmental damage by degrading trails and scaring wildlife (Webster, 2013). Recently, wilderness tourism
operators who hold Crown land tenure to operate in remote areas have complained that ORVs negatively affect their
visitors’ experiences. Some of these conflicts may now be mitigated through the implementation of the Off-Road Vehicle
Act, which was passed in 2014. This Act requires mandatory registration of ORVs, and includes elements that promote
safety, enforcement of regulations, education, and outreach (British Columbia Ministry Forest, Lands and Natural
Resource Operations, 2014).

Guest Ranchers and Hunting Outfitters
Guest and Dude Ranches
Guest ranches and dude ranches offer personal and home-like vacation experiences centered on horseback riding
and an authentic ranch experience. These operators typically offer accommodation in a ranch-type environment, and
include as part of the experience the opportunity to participate in ranch activities such as horse riding and cattle
wrangling. Other services and activities may also be available, such as spa treatments, hiking, canoeing, and fishing (BC
Guest Ranchers Association, n.d.).

The British Columbia Guest Ranchers Association (BCGRA) represents guest and dude ranch operators in
the province. It serves and represents its members through cooperative marketing, advertising, development
of operational standards, and member pricing on liability insurance plans (BCGRA, n.d.). For more

A 2011 study of guest ranches by Tourism BC found that there were 57 operating ranches in the province. Most of
these were small operations with one to five employees and serving fewer than 1,000 clients per year (Tourism BC,
2011a). There are also large operations such as the Hills Health Guest Ranch located near 100 Mile House, which can
accommodate hundreds of guests at one time. The ranch features a full on-site spa and two dining rooms, and hosts a
multitude of special events each year. Two other examples of unique guest ranch operations are the Siwash Lake Ranch
in south-central BC, a “high-end” exclusive resort featuring executive-chef prepared meals, and the Echo Valley Ranch
and Spa in the BC interior, offering an alternative therapy spa and gold-panning excursions.

Hunting Outfitters
Hunting is a traditional recreational activity in BC, and it is also one of the original tourism products in the province
(GOABC, n.d.). BC is fortunate to have a vast amount of wilderness available for hunting activities. The exact size of the
hunting market is difficult to quantify, but in 2003, a study found that 5,000 non-resident hunting licences were sold in
BC, contributing $46 million to the provincial economy (CTC, 2012).
Some people choose self-guided hunting activities, but to hunt certain species, a guide outfitter must be hired.
Guide outfitters are licensed by the BC Government to provide commercial hunting services for non-residents. This
commercial hunt service directly employs more than 2,000 BC residents and generates approximately $116 million in
economic activity annually (GOABC, n.d.). Many of these outfitters are small family operations based in rural areas; they
are a source valuable economic activity in areas with limited resources (GOABC, n.d.).

Spotlight On: Guide Outfitters Association of BC
Guide Outfitters Association of BC (GOABC) was established in 1966 to promote and preserve the interests
of guide outfitters who take hunters out into wildlife habitat. GOABC is also the publisher of Mountain Hunter
magazine. Its website outlines a code of conduct and standards for guide outfitters as well as a wildlife DNA
collection program to help provide insight into animal populations. For more information, visit the Guide
Outfitters Association of BC website: http://www.goabc.org

Cycling
Cycling is a popular recreational activity in BC thanks to a variety of terrain, spectacular scenery, and favourable weather
conditions, with approximately 44% of residents participating each year (Tourism BC, 2013). Cycling also attracts out-ofprovince visitors. One study from 2008 reported that out of 5.6 million Canadians who travelled to BC over a two-year
period, almost one million (17%) had participated in a cycling activity (Tourism BC, 2009).

Spotlight On: Cycling Destinations
Several BC destinations have developed cycling as a key tourism product. For example, the Salt Spring
Island group Island Pathways helped make the island more bike-friendly in recent years by installing bike
racks, developing a map with bike routes, encouraging local transportation to accommodate bikes, and
establishing local bike rentals and service. For more information, visit Salt Spring Island Cycling:
http://www.saltspringtourism.com/cycling/
Another great example of cycling tourism is the Kettle Valley Railway in the Okanagan, built on an abandoned
railbed. This 600-kilometre trail network includes a multitude of tunnels and trestles, and is most often
travelled by cycling. Sections of the trail system are also now included in the Trans Canada Trail. For more
information, visit the Kettle Valley Railway website: http://www.kettlevalleyrailway.ca/

Cycling can be generalized into two styles: road cycling and mountain biking.
Road cycling appeals to those who want to travel on paved roads on bikes designed for travelling long distances
efficiently and effectively. Road cycling may refer to racing, both recreational and professional, or cycle touring, where
cyclists travel by bike on single- or multi-day trips. Given the multitude of rolling hills, mountain passes, and stunning
vistas, BC is regarded as a premier cycle touring destination (Destination BC, 2014b).

Figure 5.5 Cyclists in action

Mountain biking generally involves riding on unpaved routes and trails either specially designed for biking or for
multipurpose use. BC’s reputation as a prime mountain biking destination has grown because of the unique array of

Chapter 5. Recreation | 119

trails available, ranging from the steep, challenging routes of Vancouver’s North Shore, to the high alpine cross-country
routes found in the South Chilcotin Mountains (Tourism BC, 2011b).

Take a Closer Look: Mountain Bike Tourism
The report Tourism Essentials Guide: Mountain Bike Tourism is a valuable resource for operators or
communities seeking to develop or promote mountain biking tourism in their area. It can be found at Tourism
Essentials Guide: Mountain Bike Tourism [PDF]: http://www.destinationbc.ca/getattachment/Programs/
Guides-Workshops-and-Webinars/Guides/Tourism-Business-Essentials-Guides/TBE-Guide-MountainBiking-May2011.pdf.aspx

Over the years, mountain biking has grown from being a fringe activity to a mainstay of the tourism economy. In fact,
the growth potential of mountain biking is so highly regarded that the BC Government now considers it as one of the
top growth areas in the outdoor adventure sector (Tourism BC, 2011b).
Indeed, numerous mountain winter resorts such as Whistler Blackcomb, Silverstar, and Kicking Horse have developed
mountain biking trail infrastructure and lift-accessed biking to provide off-season activities. World-class mountain
biking races such as the Test of Metal and the BC Bike Race bring thousands of riders through small communities for
mountain biking. The economic impact of these events is significant. Over the course of a single four-month season
in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor in 2006 (including the communities of North Vancouver, Squamish, and Whistler), the
economic contribution of mountain biking to local economies was $10.3 million (Western Canada Mountain Bike Tourism
Association, 2006).

Spotlight On: Test of Metal and GranFondo
Two major bike races bring significant visitors to the Sea-to-Sky Corridor. The Test of Metal, held in
Squamish, has sold out every year since 1998, and brings upward of 1,000 mountain bikers into the area
for a one-day event each June. For more information, visit The Test of Metal: http://testofmetal.com/. The
GranFondo Whistler is a road biking race from Vancouver to Whistler that now attracts upward of 7,000
participants each year. For more information, visit The GranFondo: http://granfondowhistler.com

Spotlight On: Western Canada Mountain Bike Tourism Association
Western Canada Mountain Bike Tourism Association (MBTA) is a not-for-profit organization working
toward establishing BC, and Western Canada, as the world’s foremost mountain bike tourism destination.
It has hosted a symposium on mountain bike tourism and works with Bike Parks BC to ensure terrain
development.

Camping and Hiking
In 2012, over 19.3 million people visited BC provincial parks, including 16.8 million day visitors, many of whom used the
parks for hiking and exploration in addition to picnics, swimming, and other outdoor activities. Of these visitors, 2.3
million were overnight campers, generating $15.5 million in user fees, with an average guest satisfaction rating of 82%
(BC Parks, 2012). As discussed in Chapter 3, there are also a number of private camping providers in the province.

Wildlife Viewing
Given the diversity and richness of our natural environment, it is not surprising that there is a thriving wildlife
viewing industry in BC. This includes whale, bird, and bear watching as well as travelling to view the northern lights
or alpine flowers (CTC, 2007). One study conducted by the Canadian Tourism Commission established that within BC,
approximately 37% of tourists took part in wildlife viewing while visiting. Significantly, for 13% of visitors, the primary
motivation for their travel to BC was wildlife viewing (CTC, 2007).

Spotlight On: Wilderness Tourism Association of British Columbia
The Wilderness Tourism Association of British Columbia (WTA) provides industry support and advocacy for
those operators offering nature-based tourism products. For more information, visit the Wilderness Tourism
Association of BC website: www.wilderness-tourism.bc.ca

Whale watching occurs along the coast of BC, with tours sometimes leaving from major urban centres, but more
commonly from smaller communities such as Telegraph Cove on northern Vancouver Island. Tours are typically by
boat, on vessels ranging from open, 10-passenger Zodiacs, to comfortable cabin cruisers with inside seating. The most
commonly observed whale is the orca, one of the province’s most distinctive animals. Other whales like the humpback,
minke, and Pacific grey are also frequently encountered. The province’s vast diversity of marine life is a key attraction of
the tours; in addition to whale watching, a typical tour may encounter bald eagles, sea lions, porpoises, and a variety of
sea birds (Destination BC, 2014,d).

Take a Closer Look: Mammal Viewing Guidelines
Marine mammal viewing in Canada has grown in popularity to the point where the federal government
has established marine wildlife viewing guidelines. These establish parameters such as safe viewing distances
and time limits. For more information, visit the marine wildlife viewing guidelines: http://www.pac.dfompo.gc.ca/fm-gp/species-especes/mammals-mammiferes/view-observer-eng.html

Bear viewing — whether for black bears, grizzly bears, or the rare kermode bear — is also popular. Black bears are
common across all regions of BC. Grizzly bears are more likely to be found in remote and mountainous regions; they
have an estimated population in the province of approximately 16,000. Kermode bears, also called spirit bears, are a

Chapter 5. Recreation | 121

subspecies of black bears with a genetic trait that produces white fur instead of black. They are found primarily in
the Great Bear Rainforest of the Central Coast, and figure prominently in the spiritual traditions of BC’s Coastal First
Nations. The spirit bear is also BC’s official animal (Destination BC, 2014a).

Figure 5.6 A bear in Bute Inlet, BC

Tourism operators that offer bear viewing typically operate in remote regions of BC. They may utilize raised viewing
areas or operate from a boat-based platform, and offer accommodation at night. The season is typically limited to May
through October, with the highest chances of viewing success during the salmon spawning season in the fall.

Spotlight On: Commercial Bear Viewing Association of BC
Bear viewing is a complex activity with potential for physical risk to visitors and impacts to the bears. The
Commercial Bear Viewing Association of BC (CBVA) sets standards for operators offering bear viewing. For
more information, visit the Commercial Bear Viewing Association website: http://www.bearviewing.ca

Now that we’ve explored some of the key land-based tourism and recreational experiences in BC, let’s turn to the water.

Water-Based Recreation and Tourism
Water-based recreation and tourism in BC is extensive and varied. The coastline of more than 25,000 kilometres in
length provides ideal opportunities for recreation and tourism (BC Adventure, n.d.). Activities include scuba diving, boat
122 | Chapter 5. Recreation

tours, sport fishing, paddle sports, and more. Following is an overview of a few core water-based activities offered by
BC tourism operators, as well as a brief description of their economic contributions and related industry organizations.

Figure 5.7 Kayakers waiting near whitewater rapids

Scuba Diving
BC waters offer scuba divers a rich diversity of marine life such as giant Pacific octopuses, wolf eels, sixgill sharks,
soft corals, and cloud sponges. As well, a variety of dive sites are available, including marine parks, protected natural
areas, sunken naval vessels, artificial reefs, historic wrecks, and even a submerged fuselage of a Boeing 737 airliner (Dive
Industry Association of BC, n.d.).
A 2004 study conducted by the Dive Industry Association of BC found that the dive industry in BC consisted of 116
operators offering services to tourists and residents alike. The many segments of the industry include manufacturers,
distributers, dive charters, dive shops, and instructional centres. The study estimated that gross revenues from this
industry at $15 million, although this number failed to account for other indirect spending such as trip-related
accommodation and transportation. It is likely that the actual economic value of this subsector is actually significantly
larger (Ivanova, 2004).

Spotlight On: Dive Industry Association of British Columbia
Established in 2002, the Dive Industry Association of British Columbia (DIABC) is a not-for-profit that
represents and supports the recreational diving industry in BC. Funded in part by matching donations from
Destination BC, their diverse membership includes dive shops, tour operators, and individual dive guides. For
more information, visit the Dive Industry Association of BC: http://diveindustrybc.com

Chapter 5. Recreation | 123

Sport Fishing and Lodges
There is a long and rich history of sport fishing in BC. Anglers are drawn to the province’s tidal waters (for salmon
and halibut) and to freshwater rivers and lakes (for trout, steelhead, and sturgeon). The annual rate of recreational
participation is significant; a 2009 study estimated that there are nearly 600,000 anglers (either fresh or saltwater)
in any given year in BC (Tourism BC, 2009). Furthermore, non-resident anglers contributed almost $6 million by
way of licensing fees, and an additional $46 million in non-fishing expenditures to the economy of BC. The British
Columbia Fishing Resorts and Outfitters Association (BCFROA) represents commercial freshwater resorts and outfitters
and delivers advocacy, conservation, and marketing efforts on behalf of its members (BCFROA, n.d.).

Paddle Sports
River rafting, canoeing, sea kayaking, and standup paddle boarding (SUP) are common activities for both recreationists
and tourists alike in BC. Collectively, these sports fall under the paddle sports category, which encompasses any activity
that takes place in small boats propelled by paddles (Education Scotland, n.d.). Although all paddle sports are popular
recreational activities, two of the more sizable and commercially productive paddle sports subsectors are river rafting
and sea kayaking.
River rafting operators can be found on many rivers across BC. Product offerings may range from a three-hour
adrenaline-fuelled tour on the famous Fraser River to a 14-day wilderness exploration down the UNESCO World
Heritage Tatshenshini-Alsek Rivers in northern BC. These trips consist primarily of three types of rafting: paddle rafting,
motorized rafting, and float trips (Destination BC, n.d.).
Commercial rafting in BC is represented by the British Columbia River Outfitters Association (BCROA), which acts as
a regulatory and marketing organization for river rafting in the province. Guides are required to be certified at one of
three levels: guide, senior guide, or trip leader. Each river in BC that is commonly rafted has an extensive set of safety
requirements called “provisions” listed by the BCROA. These provisions set out the minimum level of guide required,
acceptable water levels ranges, and type of equipment needed for each river excursion (BCROA, n.d.).

Figure 5.8 A rafting trip with Canadian Outback Adventures
and Events near Squamish, BC

A 2005 study conducted by Tourism BC identified 59 operators offering river rafting trips in the province. With an
124 | Chapter 5. Recreation

average of 5.5 employees, these operations are typically small in comparison to other industry subsectors. Collectively,
however, they provided services to 216,000 customers and contributed almost $15 million in gross revenues to the BC
economy in 2005. The same study also indicated that up to 75% of participants had travelled to join in the activity,
indicating that they can predominantly be classified as adventure tourists (Tourism BC, 2007a).
Sea kayaking in BC has grown into a sizable recreational and commercial industry in recent years. The province is highly
regarded internationally for its long coastline punctuated by many inlets and fjords. Kayaking trips may be as short
as an afternoon harbour tour, or as long as a seven-day wilderness exploration to the remote regions of Vancouver
Island. Noteworthy areas for sea kayakers include Pacific Rim National Park on western Vancouver Island, Johnstone
Strait on northern Vancouver Island, and Gwaii Haanas National Park in Haida Gwaii.
A 2005 report entitled British Columbia’s Sea Kayaking Sector identified more than 114 operators offering rentals,
instruction, day tours, or multi-day tours. These operators reported gross revenues of approximately $14 million in 2005
(Tourism BC, 2005a).

Spotlight On: The Sea Kayak Guides Alliance of BC
Commercial operators offering tours are represented by the Sea Kayak Guides Alliance of BC (SKGABC),
which represents more than 600 individual and company members working in the commercial sea kayaking
industry. It provides operating standards, guide certification, advocacy, and government liaison services for
its members. For more information, visit the Sea Kayak Guides Alliance of BC website: www.skgabc.com

Trends and Issues
As shown throughout this chapter, recreation, outdoor recreation, and adventure tourism play predominant roles in the
tourism and hospitality industry in BC. However, there are challenges that impact the viability of this sector, as well as
barriers that limit the growth. These topics are discussed briefly here.

Land Use
Access to wilderness areas for tourism operators is an ongoing challenge. Some zones across the province are set aside
for recreation, such as provincial and national parks. However, when it comes to conducting commercial operations in
these same places, gaining access often involves an extensive permitting process that may impose restrictions on the
type of activity and the number of visitors allowed.
In addition, parks are generally limited to non-motorized activities, thus presenting barriers for tourism operators that
seek to offer mechanized recreation. Operators using Crown land for commercial activities also require authorization
from the provincial government; in some instances, priority may be given to resource extraction or development.
The permitting process can be onerous and time consuming, which for small operators, may be a barrier to growth
(Wilderness Tourism Association, 2005).
Environmental issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
Chapter 5. Recreation | 125

Environmental Impacts

Figure 5.9 “Absolutely nothing is allowed here”

Environmental impacts from climate change, deforestation, and resource extraction all have significant potential to
affect this sector of the tourism economy. On a local scale, competition with resource extraction for wilderness areas
is a vital issue; without reliable access to pristine wilderness, many operators are facing threats to their sustainability
(Wilderness Tourism Association, 2005). Indeed, conflicts with the oil and gas industry, forestry, and mining are
constant management challenges for wilderness tourism operators. On a global scale, climate change threatens tourism
in BC in many ways, including irregular and insufficient snowfall for winter operations, the pine beetle epidemic
sweeping through the province’s forests, and climate-related stress impacting prime wildlife viewing of species such as
whales and bears. Environmental issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 10: Environmental Stewardship.

Risk Management
Concerns over risk management and litigation are ongoing for any operator that offers activities with an element
of risk. When lawsuits in adventure tourism occur, they are often extensively publicized by the media, creating a
perception of risky, dangerous, and irresponsible adventure operators. This can negatively affect the sector through
rising insurance rates, increasing governmental regulation, challenging certification requirements, and permitting
difficulties when interfacing with land management agencies.
With the popularity of backcountry skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and other winter sports on the
rise in BC, the number of participants accessing backcountry areas is increasing (Mitsui, 2013). This is becoming a
concern for long-time backcountry enthusiasts as well as safety monitors such as Avalanche Canada. As winter and
summer backcountry equipment becomes more readily accessible, people are able to equip themselves without having
received advanced safety training.
The increase of backcountry users will continue to expose users to possible dangerous situations. The best scenario is
to ensure users receive proper training and education before they venture into the backcountry areas.
126 | Chapter 5. Recreation

Other elements of risk and liability are discussed further in Chapter 11.

Conclusion
Despite some of the challenges faced by recreation, outdoor recreation, and adventure tourism, the industry as a whole
remains an exciting, dynamic, and growing sector of the BC tourism economy. Employment opportunities abound, and
the potential for economic contribution to the province, protection of wilderness areas, and diversification of rural
economies away from resource extraction are exciting prospects. BC is uniquely positioned to maintain positive growth
in this area, contingent upon government support to address the barriers and challenges listed above. Students looking
to develop professionally in this field should strive to gain both hands-on experience in a specialized activity, and a
strong tourism focused education; this combination will offer the best chance to open doors to a long-term career in
this exciting industry.
Now that we understand the importance of recreation to the tourism industry, especially in BC, let’s explore Chapter 6,
which looks at entertainment, the other half of this industry classification.

Case Study: The Wind Within

BC has long been romanticized as a destination that is intrinsically linked to recreation and nature; and
our tourism product has traditionally relied on outdoor assets and the promotion of recreation.
In late 2014, Destination British Columbia launched a video and set of corresponding marketing materials that
sought to expand on the “Super, Natural” brand promise for the province.
Watch

the

video

here: “The

Wild

Within:

British

Columbia,

Canada”:

https://www.youtube.com/

watch?v=dNFrZNjs2ng
On your own or as part of a team, consider the following:
1. What natural elements are being promoted?
2. What recreational activities are featured in the video?
3. Which industry groups or associations are needed to support these activities? Name at least five.
4. What are the advantages of promoting BC’s natural elements as a pillar of marketing campaigns?
5. What are the disadvantages? How might these be mitigated?
After answering these questions, come up with a quick design for a marketing piece that profiles one
recreational activity in your local community. This could be a webpage, a brochure, an app, a poster, or another
marketing piece. Be sure to visit the Destination BC brand website to make sure your ideas fit in with “The Wild
Within” concept and brand: http://www.destinationbc.ca/Resources/british-columbia-tourism-brand.aspx

Overview
When a traveller enters Canada, there’s a good chance he or she will be asked at the border, What is the nature of your
trip? Whether the answer is for business, leisure, or visiting friends and relatives, there’s a possibility that a traveller will
participate in some of the following activities (as listed in the Statistics Canada International Travel Survey):
• Attend a festival or fair, or other cultural events
• Visit a zoo, aquarium, botanical garden, historic site, national park, museum, or art gallery
• Watch sports or participate in gaming
These activities fall under the realm of entertainment as it relates to tourism. Documenting every activity that could
be on a tourist’s to-do list would be nearly impossible, for what one traveller would find entertaining, another may not.
This chapter focuses on the major components of arts, entertainment, and attractions, including motion pictures, video
exhibitions, and wineries, all activities listed under the North American Industry Classification System we learned about
in Chapter 1.

Festivals and Events
Festival and Major Events Canada (FAME) released a report in 2009 detailing the economic impacts of the 15 largest
festivals and events across Canada, which amounted to $750 million in tourist spending and another $300 million in local
operational spending (Enigma Research Consultants, 2009). Let’s take a closer look at this segment of the sector.

Festivals
The International Dictionary of Event Management defines a festival as a “public celebration that conveys, through a
kaleidoscope of activities, certain meanings to participants and spectators” (Goldblatt, 2001, p. 78). Other definitions,
including those used by the Ontario Trillium Foundation and the European Union, highlight accessibility to the general
public and short duration as key elements that define a festival.
Search “festivals in Canada” online and over 54 million results will appear. To define these activities in the context of
tourism, we need to consider operations and marketing: in other words, we must answer the questions, Who are these
activities aimed at? and Why are they being celebrated?
The broad nature of festivals has lead to the development of classification types. For instance, funding for the federal
government’s Building Communities through Arts and Heritage Program is available under three categories, depending
on the type of festival:
1. Local festivals funding is provided to local groups for recurring festivals that present the work of local artists,
artisans, or historical performers.
2. Community anniversaries funding is provided to local groups for non-recurring local events and capital projects
that commemorate an anniversary of 100 years (or greater, in increments of 25 years).
3. Legacy funding is provided to community capital projects that commemorate a 100th anniversary (or greater, in
increments of 25 years) of a significant local historical event or local historical personality.
In 2012-13, funds awarded to BC festivals ranged from $2,000 for the Nelson History Theatre Society’s Nelson Arts and
Heritage Festival to $119,400 for the Vancouver International Film Festival (Government of Canada, 2014a).

Spotlight On: International Festivals and Events Association
Founded in 1956 as the Festival Manager’s Association, the International Festivals and Events Association
(IFEA) supports professionals who produce and support celebrations for the benefit of their communities.
Membership is required to access many of their resources. For more information, visit the International
Festivals and Events Association website: www.ifea.com

Festivals and events in BC celebrate theatre dance, film, crafts, visual arts, and more. Just a few examples are Bard on
the Beach, Vancouver International Improv Festival, Cornucopia, and the Cowichan Wine and Culinary Festival.

Figure 6.2 Guests at Cornucopia in Whistler

Spotlight On: Cornucopia, Whistler’s Celebration of Wine and Food
This festival is dubbed “the fall festival for the indulgent and the connoisseur.” It’s an 11-day showcase
with seminars, tastings, gala events, and all things decadent. For more information, visit Cornucopia:
http://whistlercornucopia.com

Events
An event is a happening at a given place and time, usually of some importance, celebrating or commemorating a special
occasion. To help broaden this simple definition, categories have been developed based on the scale of events. These
categories, presented in Table 6.1 overlap and are not hard and fast, but help cover a range of events.

Events can be extremely complex projects, which is why, over time, the role of event planners has taken on greater
importance. The development of education, training programs, and professional designations such as CMPs (Certified
Meeting Planners), CSEP (Certified Special Events Professional), and CMM (Certificate in Meeting Management) has led
to increased credibility in this business and demonstrates the importance of the sector to the economy. Furthermore,
there are a variety of event management certifications and diplomas offered in BC that enable future event and festival
planners to gain specific skills and knowledge within the sector.
Various tasks involved in event planning include:
• Conceptualizing/theming
• Logistics and planning
• Human resource management
• Security
• Marketing and public relations
• Budgeting and financial management
• Sponsorship procurement
• Management and evaluation
But events aren’t just for leisure visitors. In fact, the tourism industry has a long history of creating, hosting, and
promoting events that draw business travellers. The next section explores meetings, conventions, and incentive travel,
also known as MCIT.

Meetings, Conventions, and Incentive Travel (MCIT)
According to the Business Events Industry Coalition of Canada (BEICC), business events are big business. In 2012, they:
• Delivered at least $27 billion to Canada’s economy (1.5% of Canada’s GDP)
• Contributed $8.5 billion in taxes and service fees to all levels of government
• Created over 341,700 employment opportunities (average salary of over $50,000 per year)
The business events industry in Canada is as big as agriculture and forestry, and it provides nearly twice the number of
jobs that telecommunications and utilities do (BEICC, 2014).

There are several types of business events. Conventions generally have very large attendance, and are held annually
in different locations. They also often require a bidding process. Conferences have specific themes, and are held for
smaller, focused groups. Trade shows/trade fairs can be stand-alone events, or adjoin a convention or conference.
Finally, seminars, workshops, and retreats are examples of smaller-scale MCIT events.

industry in Canada, comprising organizations dedicated to the betterment and promotion of the meetings
and events industry. For more information, visit the Business Events Industry Coalition of Canada website:

As meeting planners became more creative, meeting and convention delegates became more demanding about meeting
sites. No longer are hotel meeting rooms and convention centres the only type of location used; non-traditional venues
have adapted and become competitive in offering services for meeting planners. These include architectural spaces
such as airplane hangars, warehouses, or rooftops and experiential venues such as aquariums, museums, and galleries
(Colston, 2014).

Incentive Travel
For many people new to the travel industry, incentive travel is an unfamiliar concept. The Society of Incentive Travel
Excellence (SITE) has explained that incentive travel involves “motivational and performance improvement strategies
of which travel is a key component” (2014). Unlike other types of business events, incentive travel is focused on fun, food,
and other activities rather than education and work.
Sectors that use incentive travel include insurance, finance, technology, pharmaceutical, and auto manufacturers and
dealers. The incentive travel market is extremely competitive and demanding. When rewarding high-performance staff,
Fortune 500-type companies are looking for the most luxurious and unique travel experiences and products available.

Convention Centres
No discussion of business events would be complete without noting the importance of convention centres — very large
venues that can host thousands of delegates.
Key success factors for convention venues include:
• Air access to the destination
• Quality hotels close to or adjacent to the venue
• Quality venue space
• Relative cost of the destination and venue
• Attractiveness of the destination
BC is home to a number of convention centres, including those in Kelowna, Nanaimo, Penticton, Prince George, and
Victoria. The signature venue for the province is the Vancouver Convention Centre, which underwent a significant
expansion prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Spotlight On: The Vancouver Convention Centre
The Vancouver Convention Centre is owned and managed by the BC Pavilion Corporation (PavCo), a Crown
corporation, and staffed with 70 PavCo employees, six official suppliers, and a further workforce of 291
full-time equivalent jobs. With its unique “scratch kitchen” that uses fresh, local products, an extensive
recycling program, and its legendary “green roof,” the centre is known for its beautiful views and commitment
to

sustainability.

With an understanding of the scope of festivals and events, as well as examples of the venues that host them, let’s turn
our attention to the diverse number of attractions that contribute to the tourism entertainment sector.

Attractions
Without attractions there would be no need for other tourism services. Indeed tourism as such would not exist
if it were not for attractions. (Swarbrooke, 2002, p. 3)
When the Canadian Tourism Commission planned a survey of Canada’s tourist attractions in 1995, there was no official
definition of tourist attractions. After consultation, federal, provincial, territorial, and industry stakeholders agreed on
a working definition: “places whose main purpose is to allow public access for entertainment, interest, or education”
(Canadian Tourism Commission, 1998, p. 3).
Five major categories were established:
1. Heritage attractions: focus on preserving and exhibiting objects, sites, and natural wonders of historical, cultural,
and educational value (e.g., museums, art galleries, historic sites, botanical gardens, zoos, nature parks,
conservation areas)
2. Amusement/entertainment attractions: maintain and provide access to amusement or entertainment facilities
(e.g., arcades; amusement, theme, and water parks)
3. Recreational attractions: maintain and provide access to outdoor or indoor facilities where people can participate
in sports and recreational activities (e.g., golf courses, skiing facilities, marinas, bowling centres)
4. Commercial attractions: retail operations dealing in gifts, handcrafted goods, and souvenirs that actively market to
tourists (e.g., craft stores listed in a tourist guide)
5. Industrial attractions: deal mainly in agriculture, forestry, and manufacturing products that actively market to
tourists (e.g., wineries, fish hatcheries, factories)
Although the data is two decades old (the survey was never repeated at a national level), the overall findings help to
outline the importance of tourist attractions to Canada’s tourism industry. The 1995 survey found:
• Just over half (51%) of attractions charged admission (49% did not).
• Surveyed attractions saw 200 million visitors with 50% of volume in the summer.
• The majority (80%) reported visits lasted under three hours.

Chapter 6. Entertainment | 141

Major revenue sources for attractions include admission, merchandising, food and beverage sales, parking, grants, and
donations. Major expenses include staff, land, insurance, permits and fees, marketing, equipment, and buildings.
The rest of this chapter explores various types of attractions in more detail.

Cultural/Heritage Tourism
The phrase cultural/heritage tourism can be interpreted in many ways. The Canadian Tourism Commission has
defined it as tourism “occurring when participation in a cultural or heritage activity is a significant factor for
traveling. Cultural tourism includes performing arts (theatre, dance, and music), visual arts and crafts, festivals,
museums and cultural centres, and historic sites and interpretive centres” (LinkBC, 2012).

Quesnel, BC

Take a Closer Look: The First Government of Canada Survey of Heritage Institutions
In late 2014 the Department of Canadian Heritage released its Survey of Heritage Institutions, which provides
aggregate financial and operating data to governments and cultural associations. It aims to gain a better
understanding of not-for-profit heritage institutions in Canada in order to aid in the development of policies
and the administration of programs. View the full version of the report at
Government of Canada Survey of Heritage Institutions: 2011 [PDF]: www.pch.gc.ca/DAMAssetPub/DAMverEval-audEval/STAGING/texte-text/
2011_Heritage_Institutions_1414680089816_eng.pdf?WT.contentAuthority=6.0

A 2011 Government of Canada survey of heritage institutions found (2014b):
• Revenues for all heritage institutions in Canada exceeded $1.73 billion (65% of which was unearned revenues —
grants, government funding, and donations)
• Sales in goods and services (gift shops, cafeterias, and other outlets) accounted for 37% of earned revenue,
followed by admissions at 20%
• Three provinces — Ontario (44%), Quebec (25%), and Alberta (9%) — had the largest share of heritage institutions
142 | Chapter 6. Entertainment

• Approximately 48% of heritage institutions charged admission, and the average adult entry fee was $7
Volunteers at heritage institutions outnumbered paid staff by approximately three to one. Of the 128,000 workers in
heritage institutions, approximately 96,000 were volunteers. The amount of time they donated (over six million hours)
contributed to huge savings for institutions. These statistics indicate that volunteerism is a critical success factor for
Canadian heritage institutions.
Overall attendance at heritage institutions totalled almost 45 million visits in 2011, with museums (21.5 million visits)
being the most popular of all heritage institution types surveyed. There were also over 137 million online visits to all
heritage institutions (captured for the first time in the history of the survey).

Performing Arts
Performing arts generally include theatre companies and dinner theatres, dance companies, musical groups, and artists
and other performing arts companies. These activities and entities contribute to a destination’s tourist product offering
and are usually considered an aspect of cultural tourism.

Figure 6.5. Yoshiko Kamikusa of BC’s Goh Ballet

In 2011, the majority of small and medium-sized performing arts companies in Canada were profitable (86.3%). The
average annual net profit was $28,300 (Government of Canada, 2014c).
British Columbia was home to 166 performing arts groups in 2012, and 103 of these were considered micro groups,
indicating that this sector of the industry is dominated by small organizations with one to four employees.

the benefit of residents and visitors alike. Originally intended to showcase BC performers, it also brings
touring groups from other regions to the province. For more information, visit Made in BC:
http://www.madeinbc.org

Art Museums and Galleries
Art museums and galleries may be public, private, or commercial. According to the Canadian Art Museum Directors
Organization (CAMDO, 2014), both art museums and public galleries present works of art to the public, exhibiting a
diverse range of art from more well-known artists to emerging artists. Exhibitions are assembled and organized by a
curator who oversees the installation of the works in the gallery space. However, art museums and public galleries have
different mandates, and therefore offer different visitor experiences.
Art museums collect historical and modern works of art for educational purposes and to preserve them for future
generations. Public galleries, on the other hand, do not generally collect or conserve works of art. Rather, they focus on
exhibitions of contemporary works as well as on programs of lectures, publications, and other events.
A few examples of the art museums and public galleries in BC are the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Greater
Victoria, Two Rivers Gallery in Prince George, and the Kelowna Art Gallery.
Many of the smaller galleries have formed partnerships within geographic regions to share marketing resources and
increase visitor appeal. One example includes the self-guided Art Route Tour in Haida Gwaii.

Museums
The term museum covers a wide range of institutions from wax museums to sports halls of fame. No matter what type
of museum it is, many are now asking if museums are still relevant in today’s high-tech world. In response, museums are
using new technology to expand the visitor experience. One example is the Royal BC Museum, which hosts an online
Learning Portal, lists recent related tweets on its home page, and is home to an IMAX theatre playing IMAX movies that
relate to the museum exhibits.

Spotlight On: Canadian Museums Association
The Canadian Museums Association (CMA) is the national organization for the advancement of Canada’s
museum community. The CMA works for the recognition, growth, and stability of the sector. Canada’s
2,500 museums and related institutions preserve Canada’s collective memory, shape national identity, and
promote tolerance and understanding. For more information, visit the Canadian Museums Association:

British Columbia is home to over 200 museums, including Vancouver’s Museum of Anthropology and Victoria’s Royal BC
Museum, both with impressive displays of Aboriginal art and culture. Smaller community museums include the Fraser
River Discovery Centre in New Westminster, and the Zeballos Heritage Museum.

Botanical Gardens
A botanical garden is a garden that displays native and non-native plants and trees. It conducts educational, research,
and public information programs that enhance public understanding and appreciation of plants, trees, and gardening
(Canadensis, 2014).
Canadian botanical gardens host an estimated 4.5 million visitors per year and are important science and educational
facilities, providing leadership in plant conservation and public education (Botanic Gardens Convervation International,
2014). British Columbia is home to notable botanical gardens such as Vancouver’s Stanley Park, the Butchart Gardens
near Victoria, UBC’s Botanical Garden, and VanDusen Botanical Garden, to name just a few.

Zoos
Zoos all over the world are facing many challenges. A recent article in The Atlantic — whose title poses the question, “Is
the Future of Zoos No Zoos at All?” — discusses how the increased use of technology by biologists, such as habitat
cameras (nest cams, bear den cams), GPS trackers, and live web feeds of natural behaviours, has transformed the zoo
experience into “reality – zoo tv” (Wald, 2014). There is also growing opposition to zoos from organizations such as PETA,
who claim that zoo enclosures deprive animals of the opportunity to meet their basic needs and develop relationships
(PETA, 2014).

Spotlight On: Canada’s Accredited Zoos and Aquariums
Canada’s Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) was founded in 1975. It represents the 33 leading zoological
parks and aquariums in Canada and promotes the welfare of, and encourages the advancement and

www.caza.ca

Canada’s Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) work in support of ethical and responsible facilities. Examples of CAZA
members in BC include the BC Wildlife Park in Kamloops, the Greater Vancouver Zoo, Kicking Horse Grizzly Bear Refuge
near Golden, Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre in Sidney, and the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada’s Accredited Zoos and
Aquariums, 2014).
Canadian zoos with high attendance levels include the Toronto Zoo with over 1.3 million guests in 2010 (Toronto Zoo,
2010), and the Vancouver Aquarium with over 1 million visitors in 2013 (Vancouver Aquarium 2013). In 2013, the Calgary
Zoo employed almost 300 full- and part-time staff and an additional 99 seasonal employees (Calgary Zoo, 2013).

Amusement and Theme Parks

Figure 6.6 Wave spinners at Vancouver’s Playland amusement park

While cultural and heritage attractions strive to present information based on historic and evolving cultures and facts,
amusement parks are attractions that often work to create alternate, fanciful realities. Theme parks have a long history
dating back to the 1500s in Europe, and have evolved ever since. Today, it is hard not to try to compare any amusement
park destination to Disneyland and Disney World. Opened in 1955 in sunny California, Disneyland set the standard
for theme parks. The Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) in Vancouver is considered one of BC’s most recognizable
amusement parks and recently celebrated its 100-year anniversary (PNE, 2015).
146 | Chapter 6. Entertainment

Canada’s ability to compete with US theme parks is hampered by our climate. With a much shorter summer season,
the ability to attract investment in order to sustain large-scale entertainment complexes is limited, as is the market for
these attractions. It’s no wonder that in 2011 profitable Canadian amusement parks only saw an average net profit of
$73,200, with 34% of firms failing to turn a profit that year. BC has only 22 amusement parks, and more than half of these
are considered small, with under 100 employees (Government of Canada, 2014d).

Spotlight On: International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions
The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) is the largest international trade
association for permanently situated amusement facilities worldwide. Dedicated to the preservation and
prosperity of the amusement industry, it represents more than 4,300 facility, supplier, and individual
members from more than 97 countries, including most amusement parks and attractions in the United
States. For more information, visit the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions
website: www.iaapa.org

Motion Picture and Video Exhibitions
The film industry in Canada, and particularly in BC, has gained international recognition in part through events such
as the Toronto International Film Festival, Montreal World Film Festival, and Vancouver International Film Festival.
According to the Motion Picture Association — Canada (2013) these festivals attracted an estimated audience of 1.9
million in 2011, as well as over 18,000 industry delegates. Festival operations, visitor spending, and delegate spending
combined totalled $163 million that year and generated 2,000 jobs (full-time equivalents).
There are no statistics available on film-induced tourism in Canada, but several notable feature films and television
series have been shot here and have drawn loyal fans to production locations. In BC, some of these titles include
Reindeer Games and Double Jeopardy (Prince George), Roxanne (Nelson), The Pledge (Fraser Canyon), Battlestar Galactica
(Kamloops), The Twilight Saga, Smallville, and Supernatural (Greater Vancouver).

Spotlight On: The Whistler Film Festival
Founded in 2001, the Whistler Film Festival has grown to become one of Canada’s premier events for
promoting the development of Western Canada’s film industry and an emerging venue in the international
circuit. The festival, held during the first weekend in December, attracts an audience of over 8,200 and more
than 500 industry delegates to the ski resort of Whistler, British Columbia, for seminars, special events, and
the screening of over 80 independent films from Canada and around the world. For more information, visit
the Whistler Film Festival: www.whistlerfilmfestival.com

Spectator Sports and Sport Tourism
Spectator sports and the growing field of sport tourism also contribute significantly to the economy and have become
a major part of the tourism industry. According to the Canadian Sport Tourism Alliance (2013), sport tourism is any
activity in which people are attracted to a particular location to attend a sport-related event as either a:
• Participant
• Spectator
• Visitor to sport attractions or delegate of sports sector meetings
In 2012, the sport tourism industry in Canada surpassed $5 billion in spending. The domestic market is the largest source
of sport tourists, accounting for 84% of all spending, followed by overseas markets (10.8%) and US visitors (5.3% of sport
tourism revenues) (Canadian Sport Tourism Alliance, 2014).

Spotlight On: Canadian Sport Tourism Alliance
The Canadian Sport Tourism Alliance (CSTA) was created in 2000 created to market Canada internationally
as a preferred sport tourism destination and grow the sport tourism industry in Canada. The purpose of the
alliance was to increase Canadian capacity to attract and host sport tourism events. The alliance has over
400 members including 142 municipalities, 200+ national and provincial sport organizations, and a variety
of product and service suppliers to the industry. For more information, visit the Canadian Sport Tourism
Alliance website: http://canadiansporttourism.com

In British Columbia, sport tourism is supported through the Ministry of Community, Sport and Cultural Development,
which invests in event hosting and the ViaSport program (formerly known as Hosting BC). Building on the success of
the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, the program has a goal to maintain BC’s profile and reputation as
an exceptional major event host. One success story is Kamloops, dubbed the Tournament Capital of Canada, which
has made sport tourism a central component of its economy and welcomes over one million visitors to its tournament
centre facility each year. And since 1977, the BC Winter and Summer Games have moved around the province, drawing
attendees and creating volunteer opportunities for up to 3,200 community members.

Take a Closer Look: The Sport Tourism Guide
The Sport Tourism Guide from Destination BC’s Tourism Business Essentials series covers topics including
understanding sport tourism, industry trends, event bidding and hosting, balance sheets, economic impacts,
case studies, best practices, and links to additional information. For more information, read the Sport

Gaming
According to the Canadian Gaming Association, gaming is one of the largest entertainment industries in Canada. It has
larger revenues than those generated by magazines and book sales, drinking establishments, spectator sports, movie
theatres, and performing arts combined (Canadian Gaming Association, 2011).

Figure 6.7 Vancouver’s Edgewater Casino

In 2011, the association released an economic impact study stating that legalized gaming had nearly tripled in size since
1995, from $6.4 billion to about $15.1 billion.
According to the BC Lottery Corporation, in 2013, the BC gaming industry was made up of:
• 17 casino facilities
• two main horse racetracks
• approximately 4,050 lottery outlets (retailers)
• 28 bingo halls including 18 bingo halls with slot machines (community gaming centres, or CGCs)
Gaming at these facilities and online generated $1.175 billion in net tax revenue to the province of BC, which was
reinvested into the heath care system and distributed to communities through a series of grants (BC Lottery
Corporation, 2013).

Spotlight on: The BC Lottery Corporation (BCLC)
The BC Lottery Corporation (BCLC) is a provincial Crown corporation that operates under the provincial
Gaming Control Act. It is responsible for operating lottery, casino, online, and bingo gaming in BC. For more
informatioon, visit the BC Lottery Corporation website: http://corporate.bclc.com

The provincial industry has grown annually since 2006, except in 2010 (slight decrease of about $15 million). The majority
Chapter 6. Entertainment | 149

of growth was accounted for by the redevelopment/expansion of existing casinos and the introduction of a number of
CGCs (Canadian Gaming Association, 2011).

Agritourism, Culinary Tourism, and Wine Tourism
Let’s now have a closer look at the world of farms, food, and wine in the entertainment and tourism industries.

Agritourism
The Canadian Farm Business Management Council defines agritourism as “travel that combines rural settings with
products of agricultural operations within a tourism experience that is paid for by visitors” (SOTC, 2011). In other words,
rural and natural environments are mixed with agricultural and tourism products and services.
Agritourism products and services can be categorized into three themes:
1. Fixed attractions such as historic farms, living farms, museums, food processing facilities, and natural areas
2. Events based on an agricultural theme such as conferences, rodeos, agricultural fairs, and food festivals
3. Services such as accommodations (B&Bs), tours, retailing (farm produce and products), and activities (fishing,
hiking, etc.) that incorporate agricultural products and/or experiences
At a time when farmers are facing increasing costs and the local food movement is growing in popularity, agritourism
presents a great opportunity to use farm resources to create experiences for visitors, whether they be for
entertainment, education, or as venues for business/meeting events. In BC, examples of agritourism businesses are Salt
Spring Island Cheese, Okanagan Lavender Herb Farm near Kelowna, and Amusé Bistro in the Cowichan Valley, where a
local monk and mushroom expert forages for local fungi (HelloBC, 2014).
The three primary agricultural regions in BC are:
1. The Fraser Valley (outside of Vancouver)
2. The Cowichan Valley (on Vancouver Island)
3. The Okanagan Valley (in the southern central part of BC)
A number of self-guided circle tours and other experiences are available in these and other areas, including annual
festivals and events, such as the Pemberton Slow Food Cycle Sunday, profiled in the Spotlight On below.

Spotlight On: Slow Food Cycle Sunday
The Slow Food Cycle Sunday began in 2005 with the Helmer family farm in Pemberton. The idea is to
connect everyday people and city residents to their farmers. Attendees register in advance and then cycle
from farm to farm gathering ingredients and enjoying tastings and learning more about farm operations. It’s
the opposite of the drive-through fast-food experience, and one that gains popularity every year. For more
information, visit Slow Food Cycle Sunday: SlowFoodCycleSunday.com

Culinary Tourism
Culinary tourism refers to “any tourism experience in which one learns about, appreciates, and/or consumes food and
drink that reflects the local, regional, or national cuisine, heritage, culture, tradition, or culinary techniques” (Ontario
Culinary Tourism Alliance, 2013). The United Nations World Tourism Organization has noted that food tourism is a
dynamic and growing segment, and that over one-third of tourism expenditures relate to food (UNWTO, 2012).
Culinary tourism in Canada began to gain traction as a niche in 2002 when the Canadian Tourism Commission
highlighted it within the cultural tourism market, and according to a Ryerson University study, the average culinary
tourist spends twice the amount of a generic tourist (Grishkewich, 2012).
While an emerging and potentially lucrative market, there is much more to learn about culinary tourists to BC, and
Canada. To date more research has profiled an additional sub-segment of culinary tourism, wine tourism, which we’ll
explore next.

Wine Tourism
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) defines wine tourism as the “tasting, consumption, or
purchase of wine, often at or near the source, such as wineries.” It also includes an educational aspect and festivals
focusing on the production of wine (Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, 2014).

Figure 6.8 Saturna Vineyards on Saturna Island, BC

There are more than 200 wineries in BC, ranging from small family-run vineyards to large estate operations. In 2011,
BC’s wine industry generated $1.43 billion in business revenue, and either directly or indirectly supported over 10,000
full-time jobs (Frank, Rimerman + Co, 2013).
Specific to tourism, wineries across BC attracted over 800,000 visitors in 2011, generating $1.63 million, more than 10%
of total provincial wine revenues. Wine tourism accounted for over 2,000 wine-related jobs that year, approximately
20% of total wine industry jobs (Frank, Rimmerman + Co, 2013).

Chapter 6. Entertainment | 151

Take a Closer Look: Wine Tourism Product Report
For more information on the wine sector in British Columbia, read this 2009 report that speaks to market
profiles, industry makeup and other important information: Wine Tourism Product Report, 2009 [PDF]:
http://www.destinationbc.ca/getattachment/Research/Research-by-Activity/Land-based/
Wine_Sector_Profile.pdf.aspx

According to the 2006 Travel Activities and Motivations Survey (TAMS), 3.3 million Canadians and 30 million Americans
participated in wine tourism in 2004/2005, with BC receiving 45% of the Canadian visitors, and just over 9% of the
American guests. These visitors earned 40% higher incomes than generic visitors, were well-educated, evenly split
between men and women, and represented a slightly older demographic (Destination BC, 2009).
While more recent data is not currently available on this still-developing sector, industry experts agree that agritourism,
culinary tourism, and wine tourism will continue to attract lucrative visitors and play a growing role in BC’s tourism
economy.

Trends and Issues
So far in this chapter, we’ve looked at entertainment experiences from wine to gambling, from farm-fresh foods to
museums and galleries, and at many things in between. But the entertainment sector doesn’t exist in a perfect world.
Now let’s examine some of the trends and issues in the sector today. Festivals, events, and other entertainment
experiences can have significant positive, and negative, impacts on communities and guests.

Impacts of Entertainment
Each type of festival, event, or attraction will have an impact on the host community and guests. Table 6.2 lists some
of the positive impacts that can be built upon and celebrated. It also lists some of the potential negative impacts event
coordinators should strive to limit.

Technology
The role of technology is shifting the guest experience from the physical to the virtual. Online gambling, virtual exhibits,
and live streaming animal habitat cams are just a few of the new ways that visitors can be entertained, often without
having to visit the destination. As this type of experience continues to thrive, the sector must constantly adapt to
capture revenues and attention.

Conclusion
Across Canada and within BC the range of activities to entertain and delight travellers runs from authentic explorations
of cultural phenomena to pure amusement. Those working in the entertainment tourism sector know that providing a
friendly, welcoming experience is a key component in sustaining any tourism destination. Whether through festivals,
events, attractions, or new virtual components, the tourism industry relies on entertainment to complete packages and
ensure guests, whether business or leisure travellers, increase their spending and enjoyment.
Thus far we’ve explored the key sectors of transportation, accommodation, food and beverage, and recreation and
entertainment. The final sector, travel services, brings these all together, and is explored in more detail in Chapter 7.

Case Study: Merridale Estate Cidery

Purchased by husband and wife team Janet Docherty and Rick Pipes in 2000, Merridale Estate Cidery is located
in the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island. The cidery itself was established by the previous owner in 1990
who planted apple trees in the location, which is considered ideal by many for its terrain and climate.
With the purchase of the cidery, Janet and Rick undertook an extensive renovation in order to transform the
facility into an agritourism attraction. They expanded the cellar and tasting rooms and created the Cider House
in 2003 from which they began running tours and tastings. From there they added:

Chapter 6. Entertainment | 155

• The Farmhouse Store with retail sales of their cider product, local agriculture products, and BC arts and
crafts
• The Bistro and Orchard Cookhouse, two distinct food and beverage operations
• The Brick Oven Bakery (producing artisanal baked goods in its on-site brick oven)
• Yurts (two cabin-style tents) for onsite accommodation
The cidery is now a destination for special events such as weddings. It also runs an InCider Club for frequent
purchasers of its products.
Visit the Merridale website at www.merridalecider.com and answer the following questions:
1. What is Merridale’s core business?
2. Who are its customers?
3. Merridale comprises food and beverage, retail, accommodations, and is an attraction. How would you
classify it as a tourism operation?
4. Is Merridale a seasonal operation? What would you consider to be its peak season? How has it extended
revenue-earning opportunities?
5. Merridale’s slogan is “Apples Expressed.” Does this tagline capture its essence? Why or why not?
6. Consider Merridale’s products, experiences, and markets. What partners should the cidery work with,
either globally or locally, to attract business? Name at least three.
7. Do you think Merridale should add components, or eliminate components, from its business? Explain
your answer.

HEATHER KNOWLES AND MORGAN WESTCOTT

Learning Objectives

• Describe the key characteristics of the travel services sector
• Define key travel services terminology
• Differentiate between types of reservation systems and booking channels
• Discuss the impacts of online travel agents on consumers and the sector
• Identify key travel services and organizations in Canada and British Columbia
• Explain the importance of additional tourism services not covered under NAICS
• Describe key trends and issues in travel services worldwide

Overview

Figure 7.1 The homepage of HelloBC.com, a site where consumers can research and
plan their trip to British Columbia

The travel services sector is made up of a complex web of relationships between a variety of suppliers, tourism products,
destination marketing organizations, tour operators, and travel agents, among many others. Under the North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS), travel services comprises businesses and functions that assist with planning
and reserving components of the visitor experience (Government of Canada, 2014).

Chapter 7. Travel Services | 159

Before we move on, let’s explore the term travel services a little more. As detailed in Chapter 1, Canada, the United States,
and Mexico all use NAICS guidelines, which define the tourism industry as consisting of transportation, accommodation,
food and beverage, recreation and entertainment, and travel services.
For many years, however, the tourism industry was classified into eight sectors: accommodations, adventure and
recreation, attractions, events and conferences, food and beverage, tourism services, transportation, and travel trade
(Yukon Department of Tourism and Culture, 2013). As you can see, most of these — from accommodations to food and
beverage — remain virtually the same under NAICS and have been covered thus far in this textbook.
Tourism services support industry development and the delivery of guest experiences, and some of these are missing
from the NAICS classification. To ensure you have a complete picture of the tourism industry in BC, this chapter will
cover both the NAICS travel services activities and some additional tourism services.
First, we’ll review the components of travel services as identified under NAICS, exploring the function of each area and
ways they interact:
1. Travel agencies
2. Online travel agencies (OTAs)
3. Tour operators
4. Destination marketing organizations (DMOs)
5. Other organizations
Following these definitions and descriptions, we’ll take a look at some other support functions that fall under tourism
services. These include sector organizations, tourism and hospitality human resources organizations, training providers,
educational institutions, government branches and ministries, economic development and city planning offices, and
consultants.
Finally, we’ll look at issues and trends in travel services, both at home, and abroad.

Components of Travel Services
While the application of travel services functions are structured somewhat differently around the world, there are a few
core types of travel services in every destination. Essentially, travel services are those processes used by guests to book
components of their trip. Let’s explore these services in more detail.

Travel Agencies

Figure 7.2 A travel agency in the United Kingdom

A travel agency is a business that operates as the intermediary between the travel industry (supplier) and the traveller
(purchaser). Part of the role of the travel agency is to market prepackaged travel tours and holidays to potential
travellers. The agency can further function as a broker between the traveller and hotels, car rentals, and tour companies
(Goeldner & Ritchie, 2003). Travel agencies can be small and privately owned or part of a larger entity.
A travel agent is the direct point of contact for a traveller who is researching and intending to purchase packages and
experiences through an agency. Travel agents can specialize in certain types of travel including specific destinations;
outdoor adventures; and backpacking, rail, cruise, cycling, or culinary tours, to name a few. These specializations can
help travellers when they require advice about their trips. Some travel agents operate at a fixed address and others offer
services both online and at a bricks-and-mortar location. Travellers are then able to have face-to-face conversations
with their agents and also reach them by phone or by email. Travel agents usually have a specialized diploma or
certificate in travel agent/travel services (go2HR, 2014).
Today, travellers have the option of researching and booking everything they need online without the help of a travel
agent. As technology and the internet are increasingly being used to market destinations, people can now choose to
book tours with a particular agency or agent, or they can be fully independent travellers (FITs), creating their own
itineraries.

Online Travel Agents (OTAs)
Increasing numbers of FITs are turning to online travel agents (OTAs), companies that aggregate accommodations
and transportation options and allow users to choose one or many components of their trip based on price or
other incentives. Examples of OTAs include Booking.com, Expedia.ca, Hotwire.com, and Kayak.com. OTAs are gaining
popularity with the travelling public; in 2012, they reported online sales of almost $100 billion (Carey, Kang, & Zea, 2012)
and almost triple that figure, upward of $278 billion, in 2013 (The Economist, 2014).
In early 2015 Expedia purchased Travelocity for $280 million, merging two of the world’s largest travel websites. Expedia

Chapter 7. Travel Services | 161

became the owner of Hotels.com, Hotwire, Egencia, and Travelocity brands, facing its major competition from Priceline
(Alba, 2015).
Although OTAs can provide lower-cost travel options to travellers and the freedom to plan and reserve when they
choose, they have posed challenges for the tourism industry and travel services infrastructure. As evidenced by the
merger of Expedia and Travelocity, the majority of popular OTA sites are owned by just a few companies, causing
some concern over lack of competition between brands. Additionally, many OTAs charge accommodation providers and
operators a commission to be listed in their inventory system. Commission-based services, as applied by Kayak, Expedia,
Hotwire, Hotels.com, and others, can have an impact on smaller operators who cannot afford to pay commissions
for multiple online inventories (Carey, Kang & Zea, 2012). Being excluded from listings can decrease the marketing reach
of the product to potential travellers, which is a challenge when many service providers in the tourism industry are small
or medium-sized businesses with budgets to match.
Finally, governments are stepping in as they see OTAs as a barrier to collecting full tax revenues on accommodations
and transportations sold in their jurisdictions. OTAs frequently charge taxes on the retail price of the component;
however, they purchase these products at a discount, remitting only the portion collected on the lesser amount to the
government. In other words, the OTA pockets the difference between taxes collected and taxes remitted (Associated
Press, 2014).
Some believe this practice shortchanges the destination that is ultimately responsible for delivering the tourism
experience. These communities rely on tax revenue to pay for infrastructure related to the visitor experience. Recent
lawsuits, including one by the state of Montana against a group of OTAs, have highlighted this challenge. To date, the
courts have sided with OTAs, sending the message that these companies are not responsible for collecting tax on behalf
of government (Associated Press, 2014).
While the industry and communities struggle to keep up with the changing dynamics of travel sales, travellers are
adapting to this new world order. One of these adaptations is the ever-increasing use of mobile devices for travel
booking. The Expedia Future of Travel Report found that 49% of travellers from the millennial generation (which includes
those born between 1980 and 1999) use mobile devices to book travel (Expedia Inc., 2014), and these numbers are
expected to continue to increase. Travel agencies are reacting by developing personalized features for digital travellers
and mobile user platforms (ETC Digital, 2014). With the number of smartphones users expected to reach 1.75 billion in
2014 (CWT Travel Management Institute, 2014) these agencies must adapt as demand dictates.

Figure 7.3 This is what a computer looked like in 1996. Less
than 20 years later you can access the world from your mobile
phone.

162 | Chapter 7. Travel Services

A key feature of travel agencies’ mobile services (and to a growing extent transportation carriers) includes the ability
to have up-to-date itinerary changes and information sent directly to their phone (Amadeus, 2014). By using mobile
platforms that can develop customized, up-to-date travel itineraries for clients, agencies and operators are able to
provide a personal touch, ideally increasing customer satisfaction rates.

Take a Closer Look: Expedia – The Future of Travel Report
Expedia is the largest online travel agency in the world. Formed in 1996, Expedia Inc. now oversees a variety
of online travel booking companies. Together they provide travellers with the option to book flights, hotels,
tours, and transportation through mobile or desktop online functions. For more on Expedia’s thoughts on the
future of travel, read its report at Expedia’s report on the Future of Travel: http://expediablog.co.uk/TheFuture-of-Travel/

Despite the growth and demand for OTAs, travel agencies are still in demand by leisure travellers (Hotel Marketing,
2013). The same is true for business travellers, especially in markets such as China and Latin America. Business clients
in these emerging markets place a premium on “high-touch” services, such as paper tickets delivered by hand, and inperson reservations services (BTN Group, 2014).

Tour Operators

Figure 7.4 A group tours the Columbia ice field in Alberta

A tour operator packages all or most of the components of an offered trip and then sells them to the traveller.
These packages can also be sold through retail outlets or travel agencies (CATO, 2014; Goeldner & Ritchie, 2003). Tour
Chapter 7. Travel Services | 163

operators work closely with hotels, transportation providers, and attractions in order to purchase large volumes of
each component and package these at a better rate than the traveller could if purchasing individually. Tour operators
generally sell to the leisure market.

Inbound, Outbound, and Receptive Tour Operators
Tour operators may be inbound, outbound, or receptive:
• Inbound tour operators bring travellers into a country as a group or through individual tour packages (e.g., a
package from China to visit Canada).
• Outbound tour operators work within a country to take travellers to other countries (e.g., a package from Canada
to the United Kingdom).
• Receptive tour operators (RTOs) are not travel agents, and they do not operate the tours. They represent the
various products of tourism suppliers to tour operators in other markets in a business-to-business (B2B)
relationship. Receptive tour operators are key to selling packages to overseas markets (Destination BC, 2014) and
creating awareness around possible product.

Destination Marketing Organizations
Destination marketing organizations (DMOs) include national tourism boards, state/provincial tourism offices, and
community convention and visitor bureaus around the world. DMOs promote “the long-term development and
marketing of a destination, focusing on convention sales, tourism marketing and service” (DMAI, 2014).

Spotlight On: Destination Marketing Association International
Destination Marketing Association International (DMAI) is the global trade association for official DMOs.
It is made up of over 600 official DMOs in 15 countries around the world. DMAI provides its members
with information, resources, research, networking opportunities, professional development, and certification
programs. For more information, visit the Destination Marketing Association International website:
www.destinationmarketing.org

With the proliferation of other planning and booking channels, including OTAs, today’s DMOs are shifting away from
travel services functions and placing a higher priority on destination management components.

Working Together
One way tour operators, DMOs, and travel agents work together is by participating in familiarization tours (FAMs for
short). These are usually hosted by the local DMO and include visits to different tour operators within a region. FAM
attendees can be media, travel agents, RTO representatives, and tour operator representatives. FAMs are frequently low
164 | Chapter 7. Travel Services

to no cost for the guests as the purpose is to orient them to the tour product or experience so they can promote or sell
it to potential guests.

Other Organizations
The majority of examples in this chapter so far have pertained to leisure travellers. There are, however, specialty
organizations that deal specifically with business trips.

Spotlight On: Global Business Travel Association Canada
Internationally, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) represents over 7,000 business travel agents
and corporate travel and meeting managers who collectively manage over $340 billion in business travel
and meetings each year (GBTA, 2014). The Canadian chapter, headquartered in Ontario, holds annual events
and shares resources on its website. For more information, visit the Global Business Travel Association:
www.gbta.org/Canada/

Business Travel Planning and Reservations
Unlike leisure trips, which are generally planned and booked by end consumers using their choice of tools, business
travel often involves a travel management company, or its online tools. Travel managers negotiate with suppliers and
ensure that all the trip components are cost effective and comply with the policies of the organization.
Many business travel planners rely on global distribution systems (GDS) to price and plan components. GDS combine
information from a group of suppliers, such as airlines. In the past, this has created a chain of information from
the supplier to GDS to the travel management company. Today, however, there is a push from airlines (through the
International Air Transport Association’s Resolution 787) to dissolve the GDS model and forge direct relationships with
buyers (BTN Group, 2014).

Destination Management Companies
According to the Association of Destination Management Executives (ADME), a destination management company
(DMC) specializes in designing and implementing corporate programs, including “events, activities, tours,
transportation and program logistics” (ADME, 2014). The packages produced by DMCs are extraordinary experiences
rather than general business trips. These are typically used as employee incentives, corporate retreats, product
launches, and loyalty programs. DMCs are the one point of contact for the client corporation, arranging for airfare,
airport transfers, ground transportation, meals, special activities, and special touches such as branded signage, gifts,
and decor (ADME, 2014). The end user is simply given (or awarded) the package and then liaises with the DMC to ensure
particular arrangements meet his or her needs and schedule.

Chapter 7. Travel Services | 165

As you can see, travel services range from online to personal, and from leisure to business applications. Now that you
have a general sense of the components of travel services, let’s look at some examples in Canada and BC.

Travel Services in Canada and BC
Travel Agencies
In British Columbia and elsewhere in Canada, many agencies are members of the Association of Canadian Travel
Agencies (ACTA). ACTA is an industry-led, membership-based organization that aims to ensure customers have
professional and meaningful counselling. Membership is optional, but it does offer the benefit of ensuring customers
receive the required services and that the travel agencies have a membership board for reference and industry resources
(ACTA, 2014).

Spotlight On: Travel CUTS Travel Agency
Travel CUTS is 100% Canadian owned and operated. As a student, you may have seen its locations on or
around campus. With a primary audience of postsecondary students, professors, and alumni, Travel CUTS
specializes in backpack-style travel to a variety of destinations. It is a full-service travel agency that can help
find flights for travel, book tours with a variety of companies including GAdventures or Intrepid Travel, assist
in booking hostels or hotels, and even help with the SWAP overseas VISA program. For more information,
visit Travel CUTS: www.travelcuts.com

Although travel agencies may be located in a specific community, the agencies and their representatives may operate
internationally, within Canada, within BC, or across regions. In Vancouver alone there are over 500 travel agencies
available to the searching traveller (Travel Agents in BC, 2014). Examples of some of the more recognized larger travel
agencies and agents operating in BC include the British Columbia Automobile Association (BCAA), Marlin Travel, and
Flight Centre.

Tour Operators
Many different types of tour operators work across BC and Canada. Tour operators can specialize in any sector or a
combination of sectors. A company may focus on ski experiences, as is the case with Destination Snow, or perhaps wine
tours in the Okanagan, which is the specialty of Distinctly Kelowna Tours. These operators specialize in one area but
there are others that work with many different service providers.

166 | Chapter 7. Travel Services

Spotlight On: Canadian Association of Tour Operators
The Canadian Association of Tour Operators (CATO) is a membership-based organization that serves as the
voice of the tour operator segment and engages in professional development and networking in the sector.
For more information, visit the Canadian Association of Tour Operators: www.cato.ca

Tour operators can vary in size, niche market, and operation capacity (time of year). An example of a niche BC tour
operator is Prince of Whales Whale Watching in Victoria. Prince of Whales offers specialty whale-watching tours yearround in a variety of boat sizes, working with the local DMO and other local booking agents to sell tours as part of
packages or as a stand-alone service to travellers. It also works to sell its product directly to the potential traveller
through its website, reservation number, and in-person sales agents (Prince of Whales, 2014).

Figure 7.5 Whales off of Victoria, BC

Examples of large RTOs representing Canada internationally include Jonview or CanTours. Operators of all kinds
frequently work closely with a number of destination marketing organizations, as evidenced during Canada’s West
Marketplace, which is a trade marketplace hosted by Destination BC and Travel Alberta. Each year the location of
the marketplace alternates between Alberta and BC (past locations have included Kelowna and Canmore). This event
provides an opportunity for Alberta and BC sellers (tour operators, local accommodation, activities, and DMOs) to sell
their products to international RTOs who in turn work with international tour operators and travel agents to repackage
the travel products. In a span of 10-minute sessions, sellers market and promote their products in hopes of having an
RTO pick up the package for future years.
On a national scale, Rendez-vous Canada is a tourism marketplace presented by the Canadian Tourism Commission that
brings together more than 1,500 tourism professionals from around the world for a series of 12- minute sessions where
they can learn more about Canadian tours and related services (Canadian Tourism Commission, 2015).
Let’s now look a little closer at the role of BC destination marketing organizations (DMOs) in providing travel services.

Chapter 7. Travel Services | 167

Destination Marketing Organizations
At the national level, the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) is responsible for strategic marketing of the country.
It works with industry and government while providing resources for small and medium-sized businesses in the form
of toolkits. In BC, there a variety of travel service providers available to help with the planning process including
Destination BC/HelloBC, regional destination marketing organizations (RDMOs), and local DMOs.

Destination BC/HelloBC
HelloBC is the official travel service platform of Destination BC, British Columbia’s provincial DMO. HelloBC.com offers
access to festival activities, accommodation, transportation options, and trip ideas. This website is complemented by
a social media presence through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (HelloBC, 2014a). Although the online resources are
highly detailed, visitors also have the option of ordering a paper copy of the BC Travel Guide.
To assist with trip planning, HelloBC features a booking agent system, offering discounts and special deals created
in partnership with operators. Although the site can process these value-added components, it does not
handle accommodation bookings, instead directing the interested party to the reservation system of a chosen provider.

Figure 7.6 Cyclists make a stop at a Visitor
Centre, with its distinctive blue and yellow
logo

In addition to operating HelloBC, Destination BC also oversees a network of 136 Visitor Centres that can be identified
by the blue and yellow logo. These are a source of itinerary information for the FIT and a purchase point for travellers
wishing to book trip components (HelloBC, 2014b).

168 | Chapter 7. Travel Services

Regional Destination Marketing Organizations
BC is divided into five regional destination marketing organizations, or RDMOs: Vancouver Island, Thompson
Okanagan, Northern British Columbia, Cariboo Chilcotin Coast and the Kootenay Rockies (HelloBC, 2014c). Along with
Destination BC, these RDMOs work to market their particular region.

Figure 7.7 A tour group in the Kootenay Rockies

Housed within the HelloBC online platform, each RDMO has an online presence and travel guide specific to the region
as well as a regional social media presence. These guides are important as they allow regional operators to participate
in the guide and consumer website in order to encourage visitation to the area and build their tourism operations.

Community Destination Marketing Organizations
Community destination marketing organizations (CDMOs) are responsible for marketing a specific destination or
area, such as Whistler or Kimberley. Travel services typically offered include hotel search engines, specific destination
packages and offers, discounts, events and festival listings, and other information of interest to potential visitors.
In the absence of a CDMO, sometimes these services are provided by the local chamber of commerce or economic
development office.

Spotlight On: Tourism Tofino
Tourism Tofino is the local DMO for the Tofino area, located on the west side of Vancouver Island. Tofino is a
destination region that attracts travellers to Pacific Rim National Park, surfing opportunities, storm watching,
and the Pacific Ocean. As part of its marketing tactics, Tourism Tofino offers visitors key planning tools
on the landing site. To encourage shoulder season visitation, storm-watching deals are highlighted, which
also allows visitors to inquire directly with the accommodation provider and/or tour operator. For more
information, visit Tourism Tofino: www.tourismtofino.com

Complementing BC’s Visitor Centre network mentioned earlier, local visitor centres are managed by individual
communities. Visitor centres may be housed in gateway buildings at strategic locations, in historic or cultural buildings,
or at an office located in town. They are designed to provide general information to travellers and may include other
services such as booking hotels, free Wi-Fi, and help from a visitor information counsellor (SGSEP, 2012).

Other Systems and Organizations
A number of customized and targeted reservation systems are used by BC DMOs and other organizations. One example
is the BC campground reservation online booking systems. BC Parks, Parks Canada, and private campground operators
all use different proprietary reservation systems. Both BC Parks and Parks Canada reservation systems open on a
specific date in the spring for bookings later in the year. These systems let visitors review what a site looks like through
photos or video and pick which site they would like to book in the campground. Many campgrounds also offer a firstcome-first-served system, as well as overflow sites, to accommodate visitors who may not have reserved a site.
In the business market, there are several companies in BC and Canada that facilitate planning and booking. Concur is
an example of a travel management company widely used in British Columbia and Canada by organizations including
CIBC, Kellogg’s, and Pentax. It provides services including trip planning software for use by employees, expense and
invoicing software for use by managers, and a mobile application that ensures clients can take the technology on the go.
170 | Chapter 7. Travel Services

Its services have contributed to client savings, such as reducing the travel expenses for one client by almost one-fifth in
their first year of use in Ontario (Concur, 2014).
BC is home to several DMCs including Cantrav, Pacific Destination Services, and Rare Indigo (Tourism Vancouver, 2014).
All offer event services as well as turnkey operations (where all logistics are handled by the DMC and invoiced to the
corporation).
So far we’ve looked at travel services as defined by NAICS. Next let’s have a closer look at additional services generally
considered to be part of the tourism economy.

Tourism Services
Many organizations can have a hand in tourism development. These include:
• Sector-specific associations
• Tourism and hospitality human resources organizations
• Training providers
• Educational institutions
• Government branches and ministries in land use, planning, development, environmental, transportation, and other
related fields
• Economic development and city planning offices
• Consultants
The rest of this section describes Canadian and BC-based examples of these.

Sector-Specific Associations
Numerous not-for-profit and arm’s-length organizations drive the growth of specific segments of our industry.
Examples of these associations can be found throughout this textbook in the Spotlight On features, and include groups
like:
• BC Hotel Association
• Sea Kayak Guides Alliance of BC
• Restaurants Canada
These can serve as regulatory bodies, advocacy agencies, certification providers, and information sources.

Tourism and Hospitality Human Resource Support
The Canadian Tourism Human Resource Council (CTHRC) is a national sector council responsible for best practice
research, training, and other professional development support on behalf of the 174,000 tourism businesses and the 1.75
million people employed in tourism-related occupations across the country. In BC, an organization called go2HR serves

Chapter 7. Travel Services | 171

to educate employers on attracting, training, and retaining employees, as well as hosts a tourism job board to match
prospective employees with job options in tourism around the province.

Training Providers
Throughout this textbook, you’ll see examples of not-for-profit industry associations that provide training and
certification for industry professionals. For example, the Association of Canadian Travel Agents offers a full-time and
distance program to train for the occupation of certified travel counsellor. Closer to home, an organization called
WorldHost, a division of Destination BC, offers world-class customer service training.
You’ll learn more about training providers and tourism human resources development in Chapter 9: Customer Service.

Educational Institutions

Figure 7.8 President and CEO of Tourism Vancouver, Rick
Antonson, at a LinkBC networking event in early 2014

British Columbia is also home to a number of high-quality public and private colleges and universities that offer
tourism-related educational options. Training options at these colleges and universities include certificates, diplomas,
degrees and masters-level programs in adventure tourism, outdoor recreation, hospitality management, and tourism
management. Whether students are learning how to manage a restaurant at Camosun College, gaining mountain
adventure skills at College of the Rockies, or exploring the world of outdoor recreation and tourism management at the
University of Northern BC, tomorrow’s workforce is being prepared by skilled instructors with solid industry experience.

Spotlight On: LinkBC
LinkBC is a membership-based organization that receives funding from Destination BC to support students
and instructors at postsecondary institutions in connecting with the tourism industry. It hosts an annual
Student Case Competition, a networking event called Student-Industry Rendezvous, and provides students

172 | Chapter 7. Travel Services

with information about education options at its study tourism in BC website. For more information, visit the
LinkBC website: http://linkbc.ca or Study Tourism in BC: www.studytourisminbc.ca

Government Departments
At the time this chapter was written, there were at least eight distinct provincial government ministries that had
influence on tourism and hospitality development in British Columbia. These are:
• Community, Sport and Cultural Development
• Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training
• Advanced Education
• Transportation and Infrastructure
• Environment
• Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations
• International Trade
• Small Business and Economic Development
Ministry names and responsibilities may change over time, but the functions performed by provincial ministries are
critical to tourism operators and communities, as are the functions of similar departments at the federal level.
At the community level, tourism functions are often performed by planning officers, economic development officers,
and chambers of commerce.

Consultants
A final, hidden layer to the travel services sector is that of independent consultants and consulting firms. These people
and companies offer services to the industry in a business-to-business format, and they vary from individuals to smallscale firms to international companies. In BC, tourism-based consulting firms include:
• IntraVISTAS: specializing in aviation and transportation logistics advising
• Chemistry Consulting: specializing in human relations and labour market development
• Tartan: a public-relations and reputation management firm
For many people trained in specific industry fields, consulting offers the opportunity to give back to the industry while
maintaining workload flexibility.

Chapter 7. Travel Services | 173

Trends and Issues
Now that we have an understanding of the travel and tourism services providers in BC, let’s review some of the current
trends and issues in the sector.

Budgets
In the travel services sector, providers such as OTAs and business travel managers must constantly be aware of price
sensitivity. Many tourism services organizations are not-for-profit entities that rely on membership dues, donations,
grants, and government funding to survive. As the economic climate becomes strained and budgets are tightened,
all groups are increasingly forced to demonstrate return on investment to stakeholders. As some of the benefits of travel
services are difficult to define, groups must innovate or face extinction.
The challenge of budget constraints came to life in late 2014 when Destination BC announced it was shutting down
its Visitor Centres at Vancouver International Airport and reviewing five other gateway locations including Peace Arch
and Golden. While the airport locations welcomed over 180,000 visitors per year, analysis performed by Destination BC
showed guests were asking non-tourism questions, and the centres’ value was questioned. Closing the centres at the
airport, it was determined, would save $500,000 per year — but some in the industry were left wondering why they
weren’t consulted prior to the announcement (Smyth, 2014).

Technology

Figure 7.9 Tablets, laptops, and mobile phones put
reservations and booking options at the traveller’s fingertips.

As discussed earlier, online travel agencies have revolutionized the sector in a short span of time. Online travel bookings
and marketing accounts for roughly one-third of all global e-commerce, and according to many these continue to rattle
the sector.

174 | Chapter 7. Travel Services

Take a Closer Look: The Trouble with Travel Distribution
This report, by McKinsey & Company, addresses the widespread impact of technological innovations on
the travel services sector. To view the report online, visit The Trouble with Travel Distribution:
www.mckinsey.com/insights/travel_transportation/the_trouble_with_travel_distribution

That said, OTAs and other technology providers can benefit operators and the travel services sector as a whole. Keeping
in mind that travel services pertain to the planning and reserving of trip components, recent beneficial technologic
improvements include the following (Orfutt, 2013):
• Real-time and automated inventory management, ensuring operators and travellers alike are working with
accurate information when planning and booking
• A pollution and weather detection chip that would help tour operators, transportation providers, and visitors
anticipate, and plan for changes in conditions
• Personalized information presented to visitors to help them narrow their choices in the trip planning process,
ensuring users are not overwhelmed with information, and making the most of limited screen size on mobile
devices and tablets
• Social technologies and on-the-go information sharing, allowing users to plan at the last minute as they travel
• Virtual assistant holograms and tablets carrying information that can replace humans during the travel experience
(for instance, at airport arrivals and visitor centres)
These innovations will likely increase as more advances are made. They also have significant implications for the
marketing of travel products and experiences, which is explored more in Chapter 8.

Conclusion
In a time when financial resources are limited and competition for tourist dollars is strong, the travel services sector
is being forced to innovate at a startling rate. With the emergence of OTAs and the rapid pace of change, it’s likely the
travel services landscape will be radically different by the time you read this.
Just 20 years ago, the travel agent was paramount for booking both leisure and business travel, while today’s traveller
can book a trip using a phone in a matter of minutes. This is one sector with challenging and exciting times ahead.
To this point we have learned about the five sectors of tourism: transportation, accommodation, food and beverage,
recreation and entertainment, and travel services. With this foundation in place, let’s delve deeper into the industry by
learning more about how these sectors are promoted to customers in Chapter 8 on services marketing.

Case Study: Online Travel Agents Sue Skiplagger.com

In late 2014, an online travel agent and airline combined forces to sue a 22-year-old and his company
Skiplagged.com. Skiplagged helped users find less expensive flights by uncovering “hidden city” tickets. These
are flights with stopovers in multiple locations, whereby the passenger gets off at one of the stopover cities
rather than the final destination (Harris and Sasso, 2014).
Hidden city tickets work when the cost to travel from point A to point B to point C is less expensive than a trip
from point A to point B. Passengers book the entire flight but get off at the stopover. This practice is generally
forbidden by airlines because of safety concerns and challenges to logistics as it renders passenger counts
inaccurate, causing potential delays and fuel miscalculations. If discovered, it can result in a passenger having
his or her ticket voided.
The lawsuit against Skiplagged founder Aktarer Zaman stated that the site “intentionally and maliciously …
[promoted] prohibited forms of travel” (Harris and Sasso, 2014, ¶ 4). Orbitz (an OTA) and United Airlines claimed
that Zaman’s website unfairly competed with their business, while making it appear these companies
were partners and endorsing the activity by linking to their websites.
Based on this case summary, answer the following questions:
1. What are the dangers and inconveniences of having passengers deplane partway through a voyage? In
addition to those listed here, come up with two more.
2. Could this lawsuit and the ensuing publicity result in unintended negative consequences for United and

Chapter 7. Travel Services | 177

Orbitz? What might these be?
3. On the other hand, could the suit have unintended positive results for Skiplagged.com? Try to name at
least three.
4. Should Zaman be held responsible for facilitating this type of travel already in practice? Or should
passengers bear the responsibility? Why or why not?
5. Imagine your flight is delayed because a passenger count is inaccurate and fuel must be recalculated.
What action would you take, if any?
6. Look up the case to see what updates are available (United Airlines Inc. v. Zaman, 14-cv-9214, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). Was the outcome what you predicted? Why or why not?

Marketing is a continuous, sequential process through which management plans, researches, implements, controls,
and evaluates activities designed to satisfy the customers’ needs and wants, and meet the organization’s

Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 181

objectives. According to Morrison (2010), services marketing “is a concept based on a recognition of the uniqueness of
all services; it is a branch of marketing that specifically applies to the service industries”(p. 767).
Marketing in the tourism and hospitality industry requires an understanding of the differences between marketing
goods and marketing services. To be successful in tourism marketing, organizations need to understand the unique
characteristics of their tourism experiences, the motivations and behaviours of travelling consumers, and the
fundamental differences between marketing goods and services.

The Evolution of Marketing
Until the 1930s, the primary objective of businesses was manufacturing, with little thought given to sales or marketing.
In the 1930s, a focus on sales became more important; technological advances meant that multiple companies could
produce similar goods, creating increased competition. Even as companies began to understand the importance of sales,
the needs and wants of the customer remained a secondary consideration (Morrison, 2010).
In 1944, the first television commercial, for Bulova watches, reached 4,000 sets (Davis, 2013). The decades that followed,
the 1950s and 1960s, are known as an era when marketing began to truly take off, with the number of mediums
expanding and TV ad spending going from 5% of total TV revenues in 1953 to 15% just one year later (Davis, 2013).

182 | Chapter 8. Services Marketing

Figure 8.2 A 1970s Peter Max-designed ad for the American Cancer Society urging people
to not smoke

The era from approximately 1950 to around 1970 was known as a time of marketing orientation (Morrison, 2010).
Customers had more choice in product, this required companies to shift focus to ensure that consumers knew how their
products matched specific needs. This was also the time where quality of service and customer satisfaction became part
of organizational strategy. We began to see companies develop internal marketing departments, and in the 1960s, the
first full-service advertising agencies began to emerge.
Societal marketing emerged in the 1970s when organizations began to recognize their place in society and their
responsibility to citizens (or at least the appearance thereof). This change is demonstrated, for example, by natural
resource

transparent policies. This decade saw the emergence of media we are familiar with today (the first hand-held mobile
phone was launched in 1973) and the decline of traditional marketing through vehicles such as print; the latter evidenced
by the closure of LIFE Magazine in 1972 amid complaints that TV advertising was too difficult to compete with (Davis,
2013).
The mid-1990s ushered in the start of the online marketing era. E-commerce (electronic commerce) revolutionized
every industry, perhaps impacting the travel industry most of all. Tourism and hospitality service providers
began making use of this technology to optimize marketing to consumers; manage reservations; facilitate transactions;
partner and package itineraries; provide (multiple) customer feedback channels; collect, mine, analyze, and sell data;
and automate functions. The marketing opportunities of this era appear limitless. Table 8.1 summarizes the evolution of
marketing over the last century.

Typically, the progression of marketing in tourism and hospitality has been 10 to 20 years behind other sectors. Some
in the industry attribute this to the traditional career path in the tourism and hospitality industry where managers and
executives worked their way up the ranks (e.g., from bellhop to general manager) rather than through a postsecondary
business education. It was commonly believed that to be a leader in this industry one had to understand the operations
inside-out, so training and development of managers was based on technical and functional capabilities, rather than
marketing savvy. And, as we’ll learn next, marketing services and experiences is distinct and sometimes more
challenging than marketing goods. For these reasons, most businesses in the industry have been developing marketing
skills for only about 30 years (Morrison, 2010).

Differences Between Goods and Services

Figure 8.3 Selling a moment like this one, captured over the holidays in Victoria’s harbour, is different
from selling a tube of toothpaste.

There are four key differences between goods and services. According to numerous scholars (Regan; Rathmell; Shostack;
Zeithaml et al. in Wolak, Kalafatis, & Harris, 1998) services are:
1. Intangible
2. Heterogeneous
3. Inseparable (simultaneously produced and consumed)
4. Perishable
The rest of this section details what these concepts mean.

Intangibility
Tangible goods are ones the customer can see, feel, and/or taste ahead of payment. Intangible services, on the other
hand, cannot be “touched” beforehand. An airplane flight is an example of an intangible service because a customer
purchases it in advance and doesn’t “experience” or “consume” the product until he or she is on the plane.

Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 185

Heterogeneity
While most goods may be replicated identically, services are never exactly the same; they are heterogeneous. Variability
in experiences may be caused by location, time, topography, season, the environment, amenities, events, and service
providers. Because human beings factor so largely in the provision of services, the quality and level of service may differ
between vendors or may even be inconsistent within one provider. We will discuss quality and level of service further in
Chapter 9.

Inseparability
A physical good may last for an extended period of time (in some cases for many years). In contrast, a service is produced
and consumed at the same time. A service exists only at the moment or during the period in which a person is engaged
and immersed in the experience.

Figure 8.4 These empty seats represent lost revenue for the
airline.

Perishability
Services and experiences cannot be stored; they are highly perishable. In contrast, goods may be held in physical
inventory in a lot, warehouse, or a store until purchased, then used and stored at a person’s home or place of work.
If a service is not sold when available, it disappears forever. Using the airline example, once the airplane takes off, the
opportunity to sell tickets on that flight is lost forever, and any empty seats represent revenue lost.

Planning for Services Marketing
To ensure effective services marketing, tourism marketers need to be strategic in their planning process. Using a
tourism marketing system requires carefully evaluating multiple alternatives, choosing the right activities for specific
markets, anticipating challenges, adapting to these challenges, and measuring success (Morrison, 2010).
Tourism marketers can choose to follow a strategic management process called the PRICE concept, where they:

186 | Chapter 8. Services Marketing

• P: plan (where are we now?)
• R: research (where would we like to be?)
• ?I: implement (how do we get there?)
• C: control (how do we make sure we get there?)
• E: evaluate (how do we know if we got there?)
In this way, marketers can be more assured they are strategically satisfying both the customer’s needs and the
organization’s objectives (Morrison, 2010). The relationship between company, employees, and customers in the services
marketing context can be described as a services marketing triangle (Morrison, 2010), which is illustrated in Figure 8.5.

Figure 8.5 Services marketing triangle [Long Description] (adapted from Morrison, 2010)

In traditional marketing, a business broadcasts messaging directly to the consumer. In contrast, in services marketing,
employees play an integral component. The communications between the three groups can be summarized as follows
(Morrison, 2010):
1. External marketing: promotional efforts aimed at potential customers and guests (creating a promise between the
organization and the guest)
2. Internal marketing: training, culture, and internal communications (enabling employees to deliver on the promise)
3. Interactive marketing: direct exchanges between employees and guests (delivering the promise)
The direct and indirect ways that a company or destination reaches its potential customers or guests can be grouped
into eight concepts known as the 8 Ps of services marketing.

Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 187

8 Ps of Services Marketing
The 8 Ps are best described as the specific components required to reach selected markets. In traditional marketing,
there are four Ps: price, product, place, and promotion. In services marketing, the list expands to the following
(Morrison, 2010):
• Product: the range of product and service mix offered to customers
• Place: how the product will be made available to consumers in the market, selection of distribution channels, and
partners
• Promotion: specific combination of marketing techniques (advertising, personal sales, public relations, etc.)
• Pricing: part of a comprehensive revenue management and pricing plan
• People: developing human resources plans and strategies to support positive interactions between hosts and
guests
• Programming: customer-oriented activities (special events, festivals, or special activities) designed to increase
customer spending or length of stay, or to add to the appeal of packages
• Partnership: also known as cooperative marketing, increasing the reach and impact of marketing efforts
• Physical evidence: ways in which businesses can demonstrate their marketing claims and customers can document
their experience such as stories, reviews, blog posts, or in-location signage and components
It’s important that these components all work together in a seamless set of messages and activities known as integrated
marketing communications, or IMC, to ensure the guests receive a clear message and an experience that meets their
expectations.

Integrated Marketing Communications

Figure 8.6 During the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, many marketing partners came together to
deliver an integrated experience to guests, including shopping malls disguised as igloos.

188 | Chapter 8. Services Marketing

Integrated marketing communications (IMC) involves planning and coordinating all the promotional mix elements
(including online and social media components) to be as consistent and mutually supportive as possible. This approach
is much superior to using each element separately and independently.
Tour operators, attractions, hotels, and destination marketing organizations will often break down marketing into
separate departments, losing the opportunity to ensure each activity is aligned with a common goal. Sometimes a
potential visitor or guest is bombarded with messaging about independent destinations within a region, or businesses
within a city, rather than one consistent set of messages about the core attributes of that destination.
It’s important to consider how consumers use various and multiple channels of communication and reach out to them in
a comprehensive and coherent fashion. As a concept, IMC is not new, but it is more challenging than ever due to
the numerous social media and unconventional communication channels now available. Each channel must be well
maintained and aligned around the same messages, and selected with the visitor in mind. Too often businesses and
destinations deploy multiple channels and end up neglecting some of these, rather than ensuring key platforms are well
maintained (Eliason, 2014).
In order to better understand our guests, and the best ways to reach them, let’s take a closer look at the consumer as
the starting and focal point of any marketing plan.

Consumer Behaviour in Tourism and Hospitality
Customers use their senses to see, hear, smell, and touch (and sometimes taste) to decipher messages from businesses,
deciding on a product or service based on their perception of the facts rather than, at times, the actual facts. A number
of factors have been shown to impact the choices the consumer makes, including personal factors, which reflect needs,
wants, motivations, previous experience, and a person’s lifestyle, and interpersonal factors, such as culture, social class,
family, and opinion leaders.

Perception Is Reality
The area of perception can be further broken down to screens and filters, biases, selective retention, and closure
(Morrison, 2010). Let’s look at these concepts in more detail.

Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 189

Figure 8.7 All people view things through their own
perceptual filters.

The world is filled with things that stimulate people. People are exposed to thousands of messages every day. Some
stimuli come from the people around us; for example, a person on the bus might be wearing a branded cap, the bus may
have advertising pasted all over it, and free newspapers distributed at the bus station could be filled with advertising.
The human brain cannot absorb and remember all of these messages; people will screen out most of the stimuli they are
exposed to. They may remember a piece or segment of a message they have seen or heard.

Take a Closer Look: 100 BC Moments Vending Machine
As part of a 2012 integrated campaign, Destination BC (then operating as Tourism BC) created a vending
machine that offered users the opportunity to experience moments that could be part of their visit to British
Columbia. At 14 feet tall, this vending machine dispensed free items like bikes, surf boards, and discounts on
flights to encourage people to travel British Columbia. This experiential innovation was a way to provide
a tangible element to intangible services. It was complemented by an online and social media campaign
using the hashtag #100BCMoments and special web landing page at 100BCMoments.com. A video of the
San Fransisco installation earned hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube; cutting through the clutter
both in person and online. Watch it here: Giant Tourism BC Vending Machine comes to San Francisco:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWbQtK4N8cM

190 | Chapter 8. Services Marketing

Figure 8.8 A “vending machine” in San Francisco entices people to
experience 100 BC Moments

Perceptual Biases
Everyone has perceptual biases; each person sees things from his or her own unique view of the world. An advertising
message can be received and changed to something very different from the marketer’s intended statement.

Selective Retention
Once messages have made it through the screens, filters, and biases, they still may not be retained for long. Customers
will practise selective retention, holding on only to the information that supports their beliefs and attitudes.

Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 191

Closure

Figure 8.9 People use multiple filters to process information.

The brain does not like incomplete images. There is a state of psychological tension present until the image is complete
(closure). Where information is unavailable to round out the images, the mind adds the missing data. Over time, through
the use of imagery and music (such as jingles), messages are ingrained in a customer’s mind, and he or she automatically
adds the company’s name, whether it is mentioned or not.

Applying Psychology to Marketing
Marketers may determine a degree of predictability about customer perceptions. ??Customers are likely to:
• Screen out information that they are already familiar with
• Notice and retain information to satisfy a need they are aware of (want)
• Purchase services that reflect the image they perceive themselves to project
• Notice and retain things out of the norm
• Attach credibility to personal information rather than commercially generated information
Customers are less likely to:
• Use perceptual biases to distort information received on an interpersonal basis
• Absorb complicated information that requires effort to comprehend
• Notice and retain information about a competitive service or product if they are satisfied with another brand
Tourism marketers are in the business of reminding and making customers aware of their needs. Customers have to be
motivated to act on satisfying their wants and needs, while marketers need to trigger the process by supplying objectives
and potential motives.

Spotlight On: Tourism Victoria’s Visitor Centre

192 | Chapter 8. Services Marketing

Tourism Victoria’s Visitor Centre is a member of the Visitor Centre Network. Staff are available to provide
travellers with tourist information, assistance, and advice. The Tourism Victoria Visitor Centre provides
travellers with a wide range of services, including professional visitor counselling, helpful travel information
and literature, and accommodation reservations (Tourism Victoria, 2015).

Consumer Decision-Making Process

Figure 8.10 The Victoria Visitor Centre (at the base of the tower), located in
downtown’s bustling harbour, helps consumers through the decision-making
process.

In 1968, Kollat, Blackwell and Engel released the first edition of a book called Consumer Behavior where they identified a
distinct five-step pattern for consumer decision-making (1972). These steps are: need recognition, information search,
pre-purchase evaluation, purchase, and post-purchase evaluation.
Here are some critical components at each stage:
• Need recognition: For this process to start there needs to be a stimulus; a need must be triggered and identified.
• Information search: The customer begins to consult different sources of information; personal (marketer
dominated) and intrapersonal (non-marketer) factors will likely be used.
• Pre-purchase evaluation: After researching the choices, the customer starts to evaluate options using both
objective criteria, such as price and location, and subjective criteria, such as the perceived status of the product or
service.
• Purchase: The customer intends to buy the product or service that best matches the criteria, although he or she
can still be influenced by a number of factors, such as friends and family who disagree with the purchase, or a
change in personal finances.
• Post-purchase evaluation: After use, the customer evaluates the purchase against expectations; if these don’t
Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 193

match, the customer will be either dissatisfied (expectations not met) or impressed (expectations exceeded). For
this reason, it’s best for hospitality and tourism providers to “under promise” and “over deliver.”

Spotlight On: BC Ferries Vacations

overall experiences, whether travelling to Vancouver, Victoria, the north coast, or to remote and amazing
destinations in-between (BC Ferries Services, 2015).

In order to reach consumers and stimulate need, tourism marketers can employ a number of traditional and online
channels. These are detailed in the next section.

Reaching the Consumer
Marketers have more choices than ever when it comes to broadcasting their message to consumers. Potential travellers
and guests will respond, in varying degrees, to traditional channels and emerging online communications tools. There
are many choices in marketing and communication channels, each with strengths and weaknesses. Determining the
right mix, frequency, and message depends heavily on establishing objectives, completing research, performing a
situational analysis, and creating a positioning approach (Morrison, 2010). Let’s take a closer look at communications
channels that may form part of the marketing mix.

Traditional Channels
Mass Media
Mass media is best described as the use of channels that reach very large markets. Examples include national
newspapers and radio or television advertising. The immediate advantage of using mass media is the ability to reach
multiple target markets in significant numbers. Disadvantages include the high expense and difficulty in effective target
marketing and measuring return.

Figure 8.11 This is an out-of-home ad for Grouse Mountain, in a downtown Vancouver rapid
transit station, targeting people working in the area. Note the special web address for the
campaign: grousemountain.com/night-ski .

Out-Of-Home (OOH)
Out-of-home (OOH) channels refer to four major categories: billboards, transit, alternative outdoor, and street
furniture. OOH advertising plays an important role in the tourism and hospitality industry as it provides an opportunity
to inform travellers in unfamiliar territory. Transit advertising includes airports, rail, and taxi displays. Alternative
outdoor refers to arenas, stadiums, and digital media. Street furniture includes bus shelters, kiosks, and shopping malls.

Take a Closer Look: Tourism Business Essentials: Travel Media Relations Guide
Travel journalists, including bloggers, play an important role in ensuring a destination is well represented in
the press. The Travel Media Relations Guide outlines how to invite, host, and follow up with media in the
best way possible. To read the guide, visit Travel Media Relations Guide [PDF]: www.destinationbc.ca/

Print Media
Print media includes newspapers, magazines, journals, and directories. There is an increased trend away from
traditional purchased print advertising toward editorial features, as these are more trusted by consumers. A print ad
and an editorial feature created together is known as an advertorial.

Spotlight On: The Tartan Group
Founded in the 1990s in Victoria, The Tartan Group is a public relations firm focusing on tourism and
hospitality clients including Clayoquot Wilderness Resort, Harmony Hotel, Inn at Laurel Point, and Hotel
Zed. The staff have extensive experience working in the industry, and the organization has relationships
with multiple tourism associations and press groups. For more information, visit the Tartan Group website:
www.tartangroup.ca

Online Channels

Figure 8.12 This is a webpage detailing cross-promotion and partnership between
the Fairmont Empress Hotel and Helijet. Consumers are being offered this
transportation option next to the hotel booking info.

As discussed in Chapter 7, the internet is nearly twice as important as travel agents as an information source for
travel (Deloitte, 2015). There are an estimated 3 billion people around the globe with internet access, and social media
has become truly integrated into the travel and hospitality industry. TripAdvisor and similar sites have become the
customer’s first point of connection with tourism and hospitality products and experiences. This can be both an
opportunity and a threat: an opportunity to open the channels of communication, but a threat if negative information
about the travel or hospitality organization is widely spread. As online distribution expands, empowered and savvy
travellers are unbundling the booking component and self-booking directly (Deloitte, 2015).
Internet and mobile technology are referred to as interactive media. For tourism and hospitality businesses, there are
significant advantages to creating an online presence: it’s cost effective, it provides global reach, it allows a business to
be available 24/7, and it provides a reciprocal communication platform for customers.

Social Media and Reputation Management
There are also challenges with online marketing, including being noticed within the volume of information customers
are exposed to, and loss of control in delivering a message. Despite these challenges, as more consumers seek real-time
information online, tourism marketers are responding with increasingly sophisticated online marketing strategies. This
section draws from resources and expertise provided by WorldHost Training Services (2013).

Social Media
Social media is a broad term that refers to web-based and mobile applications used for social interaction and the
exchange of content. Social networking is the act of using social media. Unlike traditional media such as newspapers,
magazines, and television, social media is largely powered by user-generated content. This refers to content created
and shared by consumers rather than by marketers, journalists, experts, and other paid professionals, although they too
contribute to social networks.

Word of Mouth in the Age of Social Media
Social networking has transformed how many people interact with businesses and share experiences with others, in
a communication channel known as word of mouth where customers share directly with each other. Consumers now
have a variety of channels on which to express likes and dislikes, many of which have large audiences. Some of this
commentary is made in real time, on a smartphone, while the customer is still in the business (WorldHost, 2013).

Advertising and Trust
Social networks, and review sites in particular, are used more and more to seek information and advice on things to do
and products and services to purchase. Travellers and locals alike check out these sites for ideas on where to stay, eat,
relax, shop, and explore. These channels are highly trusted. A survey of over 28,000 consumers in 56 countries found
that consumers trust the advice of people they know (92%) and consumer opinions posted online (70%) more than any
other advertising source (Nielsen, 2012).

Online Reviews = Business Success
Research shows a direct correlation between consumer reviews and purchase decisions. A 2011 survey by Phocuswright
found that three in four active travellers cite reviews and photos as influential in choosing activities (PR Newswire, 2011).
A 2011 study conducted by Harvard Business School found that, for independent restaurants, a one-star increase in Yelp
ratings led to a 5% to 9% increase in revenue (Luca, 2011). And, according to a study by the Cornell Center for Hospitality
Research, if a hotel increases its review score on Travelocity by 1 point on a 5-point scale, it can raise its price by 11.2%
without affecting demand (Anderson, 2012).

Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 197

Understanding Customer Needs
As we have discussed, service plays an important role in shaping customer impressions, where the ultimate goal of a
tourism or hospitality business is to exceed expectations. Every customer has different wants and needs, but virtually
all customers expect the following basic needs to be taken care of:
• Quality
• Value
• Convenience
• Good service
To fully satisfy customers, businesses must deliver in all four areas. If they meet the basic needs listed above, they’ll
create a passive customer — one who is satisfied, but not likely to write a review or mention a business to others.

Figure 8.13 This unhappy customer is likely to broadcast news of her bad experience across
multiple platforms.

On the other hand, failure to deliver on the promise can result in a disappointed customer undoing all the efforts of the
marketing plan. For this reason, the entire process must be well coordinated and well executed.

Bringing it All Together
The Role of Destination BC
Destination BC is responsible for executing key components of the provincial government’s tourism strategy (British
Columbia Ministry of Jobs, Tourism and Innovation, 2011). As we learned in the last chapter, this provincial destination
marketing organization has been mandated to fulfill several key marketing and leadership responsibilities critical to the
long-term sustainable growth of the provincial tourism industry. This includes marketing British Columbia domestically,
nationally, and internationally as a tourist destination (Destination BC, n.d.). Its first three-year corporate and marketing
strategy was released in November 2014 articulating its new vision, mission, and goals.

Take a Closer Look: Online Reputation Management
This guide from Destination BC’s Tourism Business Essentials series helps businesses understand how
to manage their online reputation and includes tips for responding to reviews and other best practice.

Market Segmentation
Tourism marketers, including the team at Destination BC, choose target markets for their efforts through market
segmentation techniques, where potential visitors are separated by:
• Demographics
• Countries of origin
• Trip purposes
• Trip planning and arrangements
• Psychographics and lifestyles
• Special interests
• Technology uses
The Canadian Tourism Commission’s award-winning Explorer Quotient program provides tourism marketers with
detailed psychographic and travel motivations information (Canadian Tourism Commission, 2008; 2012). It allows
destinations and experiences to market themselves to target audiences based on psychographic profiles (their
psychological tendencies) rather than geographic segments.

Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 199

Take a Closer Look: EQ (Explorer Quotient)
Destination Canada’s EQ tool allows businesses to segment their customers in a new and innovative way. EQ
offers a range of online resources from an EQ Quiz (so you can identify what type of traveller you are) to
business toolkits and more. Explore this new tourism marketing tool by visiting the Explorer Quotient tool:
http://en.destinationcanada.com/resources-industry/explorer-quotient

BC’s Tourism and Hospitality Key Markets
BC’s key target tourism markets can be broken down into three main categories: nearby markets, top priority markets,
and emerging markets (BC Ministry of Jobs, Tourism and Innovation, 2011).
Nearby markets are BC, Alberta, and Washington State, which are characterized by high volume and strong repeat
visitation. Marketing activities to these areas are led by the regions, communities, and/or sectors such as ski. Top
priority markets of Ontario, California, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia are characterized by
high revenue and high spending per visitor. Marketing efforts here are led by Destination BC. Emerging markets, which
include China, India, and Mexico, are monitored and explored by Destination BC.

Performance Measurement and Evaluation
In order to measure its success in the realm of destination marketing, Destination BC has introduced a tool called
the net promoter score (NPS), a metric designed to monitor customer engagement. The NPS indicates the likelihood
of travellers recommending a destination to friends, family, or colleagues. NPS is based on responses to the question,
How likely are you to recommend [British Columbia] as a travel destination to a friend, family member, or colleague?
Responses are scored from 0 = “not at all likely” to 10 = “extremely likely.” Respondents are divided into three categories:
• Detractors (scores of 0 to 6): Unhappy visitors, unlikely to tell others to visit and might even damage the
reputation of a destination through negative word of mouth
• Passives (scores of 7 or 8): Marginally satisfied visitors not excited enough to tell others about their travel
experience
• Promoters (scores of 9 or 10): Loyal enthusiasts likely to return and rave about their travel experience
NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters: NPS = % of
detractors — % of supporters. The intention to recommend a travel destination, reported by the NPS, is a proxy
measure of overall satisfaction with the travel experience. Satisfaction with the travel experience and the intention to
recommend greatly increase the likelihood of a return visit to British Columbia. And word-of-mouth advocacy, either
face-to-face or through social media, is critical for attracting first-time visitors to British Columbia.
Destination BC uses NPS as a performance measurement tool (among others) to help determine the overall effectiveness
of online and integrated marketing communications strategies (Destination BC, 2013). Furthermore, Destination BC
has developed the Remarkable Experiences program to “enable tourism operators to become experts in areas such as
service design and digital marketing” (Destination BC, 2014).

Spotlight On: Aboriginal Travel Services
Aboriginal Travel Services (ATS) is BC’s first Aboriginal-owned travel agency, focusing on business and
leisure needs of companies, First Nations bands, and individual tourists. Located on Coast Salish territories
in downtown Vancouver, ATS reinvests profits into Aboriginal communities by way of youth scholarships
in tourism and hospitality. The agency was developed as a social enterprise, with the dual purpose of
selling travel services that provide cultural and economic opportunities to the communities it serves
and committing to investing in the Aboriginal communities and tourism initiatives (Aboriginal Travel
Services,

2015).

Effective planning, research, customer understanding, integrated marketing communications, and using online
customer service strategies to support effective marketing are fundamental requirements for successful services
marketing. However, it is critical that marketers understand the key trends and issues that will help to identify
tomorrow’s marketing strategies (Government of Canada, 2013).

Trends and Issues

Figure 8.14 Social media trends are just one of the influences that marketers
need to monitor.

Tourism marketers in BC need to monitor trends in the following areas that may impact the success of their marketing
efforts:
• Demographic shifts (aging population, the rise of millennials), and socioeconomics (cultural changes, economic
decline/growth)
Chapter 8. Services Marketing | 201

• Political, economic, and geographic changes (emerging or declining economies)
• Trip purpose (growth of multipurpose trips)
• Psychographic changes (special interests, healthy lifestyles, sustainability)
• Behavioural adaptations (free independent travel, decreasing brand loyalty)
• Product-related trends (emerging niches)
• Distribution channels (online travel agencies, virtual travel)
Remaining abreast of information in these areas is critical to the success of any services marketing plan, which should
be continually monitored and adapted as the landscape changes.

Conclusion
Effective services marketing in the tourism and hospitality sector requires marketers to gain a solid understanding
of the differences between the marketing of goods and services. Successful organizations use market research to
learn the preferences and behaviours of key customer segments. Through a strategic planning process, organizations
and destinations develop a marketing orientation designed to identify customer needs and trigger their wants, while
striving to meet organizational objectives. Activities are designed to support integrated marketing communications
across multiple platforms with reciprocal communications — that is, not just broadcasting information, but having
conversations with customers. Savvy marketers will leverage these conversations to keep up with evolving customer
interests while seeking an understanding of emerging trends in order to anticipate needs and wants. Engaged marketers
also know that social media and integrated marketing communications must be complemented with remarkable
customer service, which ultimately supports successful marketing strategy.
Chapter 9 will delve further into the components of delivering exceptional customer service as a key component of
industry success.

Case Study: The Wickaninnish Inn

Located in Tofino, the Wickaninnish Inn (or “the Wick,” as it’s affectionately known) is a world-recognized highend property famous for offering four seasons of luxury experiences on BC’s “wild coast.” But how does the Wick
stay top-of-mind with tourism consumers? A quick look at their marketing mix offers some answers:
• Product: The inn has long been a leader in offering experiences that go above and beyond a room in a
luxury hotel, starting with their storm-watching packages in the late fall, a time that was once their offseason.
• Place: Reservations can be made online on the inn’s website, via a toll-free number, through OTA sites
including TripAdvisor (where reviews are constantly monitored in order to engage with customers), and

204 | Chapter 8. Services Marketing

other reservation services including the HelloBC program. The staff constantly engages with, and
monitors their customers, tracking trends in traveller purchasing behaviour to ensure it is front and
centre with the inn’s target markets.
• Promotion: The inn has a well-maintained, visually rich website and social media presence on Instagram,
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Google+, and Flickr (a presence that shifts constantly depending
on where consumers can be found online). Its site features a media page with blogs, press releases, and
high-resolution photos and videos to ensure journalists can easily post a story at any time.
• Pricing: The inn has a comprehensive revenue management and pricing plan that includes packaging and
promotions for all seasons. The pricing reflects offering value to guests, while confidently staying at the
higher end of the scale.
• People: Not only does the inn attract and train staff who deliver on its promise of exceptional
experiences, the Wick also has a multi-person team responsible for sales, marketing, and media
(blogging, press releases, photography, hosting familiarization tours).
• Programming: Programs include packaging under themes such as elopement, natural, seasonal, romantic,
spa, and culinary. Many packages include the involvement of hotel personnel such as an elopement
coordinator or concierge to help guests plan specific value-added and memorable components of their
experience, such as a last-minute wedding (Wickaninnish Inn, 2015).
• Partnership: The Wick partners with other experience providers and events such as the Tofino Saltwater
Classic — a fishing tournament hosted by Brendan Morrison of the Vancouver Canucks. By supporting the
event as a platinum sponsor (Tofino Saltwater Classic, 2014), the representatives from the inn meet new
potential guests and solidifies its place in the community.
• Physical evidence: In addition to familiarization tours (see Chapter 7 for definition), the media team
ensures the inn is considered for a number of high-profile awards, and celebrates wins by broadcasting
these as they occur (e.g., Travel and Leisure Awards World’s Best Winner 2014). Prize logos are placed on
the inn’s home page online, in print ads, and in physical locations on the property. The inn also has a
regular consumer newsletter that celebrates achievements and shares promotions with past and future
guests.
Thinking about this example, answer the following questions:
1. Imagine the inn received a review on TripAdvisor that showed a customer was not satisfied. How might it
deal with this?
2. Visit the company’s website at www.wickinn.com. Who are the target customers? How is this conveyed
on the site?
3. What are the prices for packages and accommodations? What does the price signal to you about the
experience you might have at this hotel?
4. Do an online search for “Wick Inn” using your favourite search engine. What are the first five links that
come up? How do these present the property? What hand does the inn’s staff have in these results?
5. Look at the community of Tofino as it is presented online and name five potential partners for the Wick.

• Explain how the quality of customer service differentiates a destination
• Describe how to recover from service failure
• Explain how social media impacts customer service delivery

Overview
In the tourism and hospitality industry, the success or failure of our businesses and destinations depends on service.
Some, however, deliver consistently higher levels of customer service. Why and how are they able to do this? This
chapter will try to answer these questions as we explore the fundamentals of customer service in the context of a
competitive global tourism environment.

Customer Service as Part of BC’s Tourism Marketing Plan
Many credit Expo 86, and the training that began the previous year under the SuperHost banner, with bringing this
important topic to the forefront of BC’s tourism industry.

Take a Closer Look: The SuperNews
Back in the days of Expo 86, it seemed everyone in the industry had a vested interest in improving their
customer service skills. Take a look at the first edition of the SuperNews, a newsletter for industry
professionals that shared the highlights of training received by taxi drivers and at local colleges, and offered
name tags for people to encourage customers to “Expect the Most: SuperHost.” Read a copy of the SuperNews
[PDF]: www.worldhosttraining.com/documents/SuperNews_Vol1_No1.pdf

Customer service remains an integral part of delivering on BC’s tourism marketing promises to our guests. Destination
BC recently launched its Remarkable Experiences program, intended to differentiate the province as a destination
in a global market filled with competitors. Successful execution of this strategy will depend on how well employers
and their staff provide quality customer service, focusing on the importance of the “human element” in the visitor
experience (Destination BC, 2014). And across the country, the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) is encouraging
the development of Canadian Signature Experiences, made all the more memorable because of the high-quality guest
interactions they emphasize (Canadian Tourism Commission, n.d.).

A Key Issue for Employers

Figure 9.2 Great customer service takes place across many platforms
and is critical for tourism and hospitality employers.

In a 2010 Tourism Vancouver Island training and education needs assessment survey, employers and managers indicated
that customer service skills were one of the most significant issues (Tourism Vancouver Island, 2010). Employers and
210 | Chapter 9. Customer Service

human resources managers were most concerned with employee skills and training related to personal development,
tourism/hospitality knowledge, computer and communication skills, leadership/management skills, and customer
service skills and attitudes.
A similar finding emerged from a 2014 LinkBC roundtable discussion held between tourism and hospitality educators
and industry professionals. One of the main topics raised by employers was the need for new tourism professionals to
learn customer service skills and to continue to hone these over time. In all groups, across all sectors, many students
and graduates were found lacking in these skills (LinkBC, 2014).
For this reason, an entire chapter has been dedicated to exploring customer service issues, including quality of customer
service, key challenges and benefits to employers and employees, the concept of customer orientation, and ways to
recover when service interactions go wrong.

Quality of Customer Service

Figure 9.3 Service encounters can start before a guest
enters a business. Does this sign send the right message?
[Long Description]

Quality customer service is an experience of feeling valued or heard. Sometimes it’s an intangible component of why a
guest may prefer one tourism or hospitality provider over another. There is something about quality customer service
that you often can’t put your finger on — but you know it’s there. And it’s a critical factor for tourism success, both as
a means of satisfying ever-increasing customer expectations, and as a way to achieve business profitability (Erdly &
Kesterson-Townes, 2002).
In 2012, Cornell Hospitality presented a report from PKF Hospitality Research that showed guest satisfaction is heavily
influenced by service factors such as employee attitude and the pacing and order of services provided. It found that
the greater the client satisfaction, the higher the revenues for a given hospitality business, and that service plays a far
greater role than price and location in the guest-purchase decision (Cornell Hospitality Research, 2012).

Chapter 9. Customer Service | 211

Training is critical to ensuring quality service and meeting these objectives (Brown et al., 2009). On a global scale,
Canada ranks high in human resources capabilities. Unfortunately, due to the seasonal nature of many tourism and
hospitality positions, and limited access to affordable and accessible training, the industry isn’t always able to take
advantage of this position (Blanke & Chiesa, 2009), as it can be difficult to attract, train, and retain reliable and qualified
staff year-round.

Spotlight On: The Canadian Tourism Human Resources Council
In Canada, the Canadian Tourism Human Resources Commission (CTHRC) offers the national emerit training
program. Certification from emerit recognizes an individual’s competence in his or her occupation as
measured against the National Occupational Standards. Professional certification is available for dozens

The concept of total quality (TQ) refers to an approach by businesses to integrate all employees, from management to
front-level, in a process of continuous learning, with a goal of increasing customer satisfaction. It involves examining all
encounters and points of interaction with guests to identify points of improvement. Total quality management (TQM)
in tourism and hospitality is a process where service expectations are created by the entire team, with a collaborative
approach between management and employees (Kapiki, 2012).

Key Challenges and Benefits to Employers
Many employers struggle to justify the time and expense associated with training, particularly in a seasonal workplace
or environment with high staff turnover (Saunders, 2009). In fact, many of the benefits of training are intangible
and therefore difficult to measure, although there is evidence that the return-on-investment of training is quite high.
For example, employee competence and job satisfaction are not always easily assessed, but can improve productivity
and organizational profitability.

Take a Closer Look: World Travel and Tourism Council Global Talent Trends and Issues Report
The World Travel and Tourism Council’s report on trends in tourism employment speaks to the importance of
hiring and training service tourism and travel staff who can deliver quality experiences as part of the tourism
supply chain. It lists a strong customer service base as the top requirement for staff in tourism and hospitality
businesses. To read the report, visit Global Talent Trends and Issues for the Travel and Tourism Sector [PDF]:
http://www.wttc.org/-/media/382bb1e90c374262bc951226a6618201.ashx

Employers do need to understand the positive impacts of training on their bottom line. Key benefits may include
improved employee attraction/recruitment, retention, engagement, and innovation. Saunders (2009) suggests that to
be most effective, training should be oriented to develop employee potential versus addressing deficiencies.

Benefits to Employees

Figure 9.4 A waitress sings and staff entertain to celebrate a customer birthday at a café. The guests
were so thrilled they shared the photo online.

Customer service training provides employees with a foundation for effective service delivery. Potential benefits of
this training may include improved skills and attitudes; better communication skills; better understanding of workplace
practices; increased morale, confidence, self-satisfaction, and work satisfaction; increased participation; greater job/
career advancement potential; greater interest in and willingness to participate in further training; and
more independence (Grey, 2006).
As employees acquire certifications and credentials, and these are recognized by employers, both groups benefit.
Employees have a tangible way of demonstrating mastery of service knowledge and skills, and employers have tools to
assist with the recruitment and screening of potential staff.

According to Kim (2008), customer-oriented interactions between consumers and tourism employees influence the
quality of the tourism experience. Let’s take a closer look at the concept of customer orientation and what this means
in today’s tourism businesses.

Customer Orientation

Figure 9.5 An American Airlines ad from 1954 shows that, in tourism and
hospitality, service has always been paramount.

Kim defines customer orientation “as the set of activities, behaviours, and beliefs that place high priority on customers’
interests and continuously create superior customer value” (2008, p. 195). Even when employees have positive attributes,

214 | Chapter 9. Customer Service

it may not be enough to ensure positive customer engagements unless they are specifically trained toward customer
orientation (Kim, 2008).

Customer Service and Competition: The Customer-Oriented Organization
According to Masberg and colleagues, “to the customer, only service may distinguish a business from its competition”
(Masberg, Chase, & Madlem, 2003, p. 19). While specific customer service jobs require different skills, building an overall
customer-oriented organization may better meet customer expectations. One way to ensure quality service may be
to encourage tourism and hospitality professionals to acquire industry certifications. Businesses can also choose to
implement tools to determine customer satisfactions levels, such as the SERVQUAL technique that compares customer
perceptions of quality against customer expectations (Morrison, 2010). Under the SERVQUAL model, the five dimensions
of service are:
1. Reliability: where the quality and level of service is consistent
2. Assurance: knowledge and courtesy of staff and their ability to convey trust and confidence
3. Tangibles: the organization’s physical facilities, equipment, and appearance of staff
4. Empathy: the degree of caring, individualized attention that the organization’s staff provide to its customers
5. Responsiveness: the willingness of staff to help customers and provide prompt service
You can remember these five dimensions by using the acronym RATER. When these dimensions are consistently met, a
company is well on its way to becoming customer oriented.

So far we’ve explored the reasons good customer service is critical to our industry. And with the acronym RATER, we
Chapter 9. Customer Service | 215

now understand the basics of what a customer might expect from an organization. Together, these concepts can form
part of a customer relationship management (CRM) strategy for tourism and hospitality businesses. CRMs are tools
used by businesses to select customers and maintain relationships with them to increase their lifetime value to the
business.
There are a number of points in time where this relationship is maintained. For example:
• The first time potential guests visit a website and leave their email address to receive more information
• The moment a reservation is made and the company captures their personal details
• The in-person service encounters from the front desk to the parking lot
• Welcome notes, personalized menus, friendly hellos, and other touches throughout the interaction
• Background messages including clean facilities and equipment in good repair, pleasant decor and ambiance
(flowers, etc.)
• Follow-up communications like a newsletter
• Further interactions on social media
All of these touch points are opportunities to maintain strong relationships with customers and to increase the
likelihood of positive word of mouth sharing.
Let’s take a closer look at one tool that tourism and hospitality businesses are increasingly using as part of their CRM
strategies: rewarding customer loyalty.

Loyalty and Customer Relationships

Figure 9.6 Customer loyalty cards are very common in the food and beverage sector.

With competition between tourism destinations and businesses continuing to grow, organizations are increasingly
216 | Chapter 9. Customer Service

focusing on retaining existing customers, which is often less expensive than attracting new ones. This focus forces
tourism businesses to look at the customer relationship over the long term, or the customer lifetime value (CLV) cycle,
rather than at single transactions only.
It has been proven that it is much less expensive for a company to retain an existing customer than acquire a new one
(Beaujean, Davidson & Madge, 2006). Ultimately, successful organizations will strive to build a base of loyal customers
who will provide repeat business and may influence other potential customers. Building positive relationships with loyal
customers requires planning and diligence for all customer touch points. This may include (Lovelock & Wirtz, 2007):
1. Managing service encounters: training staff to provide personal service to customers
2. Providing customer incentives: inducing customers to frequent the business
3. Providing special service options: offering enhanced services or extra offerings to loyal customers
4. Developing pricing strategies to encourage long-term use: offering repeat customers special prices or rates
5. Maintaining a customer database: keeping an up-to-date set of records on customer purchase history,
preferences, demographics, and so on.
6. Communicating with customers: reaching individual customers through direct or specialized media, using nonmass media approaches
Loyalty programs pull together several of these elements to help a business identify, maintain contact with, and reward
frequent customers.

Examples of Outstanding Service
If one uses the definition of quality in service as “meeting or exceeding customer expectations” (Kapiki, 2012), then
the following examples certainly fit the description. These embody a concept known as a moment of truth (Beaujean,
Davidson & Madge, 2006) when a customer’s interaction with a front-line employee makes a critical difference in his
or her perception of that company or destination. The characteristics of employees that are best able to create these
moments include self-empowerment and self-regulation, a positive outlook, awareness of their feelings and the feelings
of others, and the ability to curb fear and anxiety while being able to access a desire to help others. These past winners
of the WorldHost customer service award demonstrate this concept in action (WorldHost, n.d.):
Tamara Turcotte of the Sidney Airport Travelodge was nominated after she came into work on her day off after hearing
that hundreds of travellers had been stranded after a bomb threat led to the cancellation of ferry trips from nearby
Swartz Bay. Reporting for duty, she helped coordinate accommodations for these travellers, looking beyond the hotel
(which was full) to the homes of coworkers and friends. Her compassion and swift actions helped turn a negative
experience for these guests into a moment of truth about visiting British Columbia.
Agazzi Abbay received word that JetsGo, a small airline and his employer, had suddenly gone out of business, and he
was out of a job. Concerned for the passengers that would be stranded by this abrupt end for the airline, he went to
the airport to give them the opportunity to share their frustration. Even though he was unable to help their situation,
he was able to demonstrate empathy and provide a listening ear as the only former JetsGo employee available across
Canada.
Andrea Chan, a guest services supervisor at the Holiday Inn and Suites in Vancouver, received a call from a hotel guest
who said she was ill. Concerned because the caller sounded disoriented, Andrea recommended a visit to the hospital. To
be sure her guest was safe, Andrea accompanied her to the emergency room and stayed with her until her health and
safety were assured — working well beyond the hours of her shift, and returning home the next morning. By treating
every guest like family, Andrea created a lasting impression about Holiday Inn and its customer service values.
Chapter 9. Customer Service | 217

Of course, it’s not possible for every customer encounter to be positive. Let’s look at what happens when a customer
encounter does not go well, and what can be done about it.

Recovery from Service Failures

Figure 9.7 Handle customer complaints before guests take them online.

If a business fails to meet customer expectations, there’s a risk the customer will tell others about it, often through social
media networks. An on-location problem that turns into an online complaint, going from private to public, can become
far more damaging to business than the original issue. To avoid any problem from escalating, organizations and staff
must work hard to resolve issues before the customer walks out the door — or pulls out a smartphone to make an online
posting.
Of course, it’s not always possible to resolve issues on the spot. A customer’s expectations may go beyond the service the
business is able to provide, or staff might not be authorized by management to provide the means necessary to resolve
the complaint. In these cases, staff must still step up as service professionals, realizing that the actions they take when
faced with a complaint can have a significant impact.
Online complaints highlight this point; reviewers are often more upset about how a problem was handled than about
the problem itself. As well, potential guests who read online complaints are looking for reassurance that the same thing
won’t happen to them. If they don’t find it, they may dismiss the business as an option and move on. How a business
handles complaints, face-to-face and online, is critical to ensuring successful recovery from service failures.
Service recovery occurs when a customer service professional takes action that results in the customer being satisfied
after a service failure has occurred. Often service failures are not the fault of front-line staff, and at times, may not
even be the fault of the business. Failure may be the result of an error made by another employee, by the guest him- or
herself, or by a technical error. Regardless of where the problem originated, when customers bring it to the attention of
the staff, they have certain expectations for resolution.
218 | Chapter 9. Customer Service

Figure 9.8 Listen, understand, act: the building blocks for resolving disputes

Disappointed customers often want:
• An empathetic ear. Sometimes they simply want to vent. They want to know that the employee or manager is
listening and cares.
• An apology. In some cases a sincere apology is enough.
• A solution. Typically customers bring issues to the attention of staff because they want them fixed.
• Compensation. Upset customers are looking for compensation, but not always.
• Follow-up. For some people, it’s important to know that their concerns are brought to the attention of
management and are fixed for future customers.
• Reassurance. Customers want to know they’re in good hands.
Skilled service recovery is especially important in the age of social media. Customers who are active on social networks
are likely to be equally vocal about their satisfaction with service recovery when a problem is expertly handled as they
are with their displeasure when they are disappointed with service (WorldHost Training Services, 2013).
While service recovery is a critical skill, all tourism and hospitality professionals should approach each encounter with
the goal of providing remarkable service. The next section explores how this is accomplished.

Chapter 9. Customer Service | 219

Exceeding Expectations with Remarkable Service

Figure 9.9 British Columbia set the bar high when it welcomed the world
to the 2010 Winter Olympic Games.

We’ve discussed the basic ingredients of meeting customer expectations. However, for a business to be successful, it’s
important to not only meet, but exceed, expectations. Remarkable service doesn’t necessarily require a great deal of
cost, time, or resources. Often it’s the little details, the special attention from employees and the personalized touches
that people remember most. There is no formula for remarkable service. It will depend on the type of customers,
the nature of their visit, and the things they value. Finding ways to provide remarkable service requires support from
management, keen observation skills, and a willingness to “go the extra mile” (Destination BC, 2013).
Providing good service is about understanding, recognizing, and anticipating the needs of customers and working hard
to meet or exceed them. The core service essentials are also simple: make eye contact, smile, greet warmly, and use
the customer’s name. These simple actions tell customers that your organization values them and is eager to help. In
order to exceed expectations, your organization must be on the alert for opportunities to provide remarkable service
(WorldHost Training Services, 2013).

The Role of Service and Social Media in Customer Satisfaction

Figure 9.10 A customer reviews a hotel, and the general manager
responds to address his concerns. [Long Description]

While the basics of great service haven’t changed, social media and networking have raised the stakes in the service
industry. The cost of a negative experience is higher — but so is the value of a positive experience. In fact, the
opportunities of social media reviews and ratings far outweigh the risks.
Businesses that take time to “listen” to social media are going to be more successful at leveraging the power of online
interactions. These companies effectively read review sites such as TripAdvisor, Yelp, and others and respond to guest
comments both good and bad.
Many factors contribute to how people rate businesses, including value, quality, and convenience. More than anything,
however, service influences customer impressions. Whereas a lapse in quality or convenience can be overcome with
excellent service, it is especially challenging to overcome the effects of bad service.

Now that we have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of customer service, maintaining positive relationships
with our guests and aiming to exceed their expectations, let’s look at some organizations that support the training and
development of the industry.

Tourism and Hospitality Human Resource Support
A number of organizations support the training, development, and credentialling of tourism and hospitality
professionals at both the national and provincial level.

Figure 9.11 British Columbia’s tourism industry has come a
long way since Expo 86, delivering great service to visitors
from near and far.

Human Resource Councils
At the national level, the Canadian Tourism Human Resource Council (CTHRC), a national sector council, is responsible
for best practice research, training, and other professional development support on behalf of the 174,000 tourism
222 | Chapter 9. Customer Service

businesses and the 1.75 million people employed in tourism-related occupations across the country. Provincially, the
organization go2HR serves to educate employers on attracting, training, and retaining employees, as well as hosts a
tourism job board to match prospective employees with job options in tourism around the province.

Training Providers
Throughout this textbook, you’ll see examples of not-for-profit industry associations providing training and
certification for industry professionals. For example, the former Canadian Institute of Travel Counsellors (CITC) is now
hosted by the Association of Canadian Travel Agents and continues to offer a full-time and distance program to train for
the occupation of Certified Travel Counsellor. Closer to home, WorldHost Training Services, a division of Destination
BC, offers world-class customer service training.

Educational Institutions
British Columbia is home to a number of high-quality public and private colleges and universities that offer tourismrelated educational options. Training options include certificates, diplomas, and degrees in adventure tourism, outdoor
recreation, hospitality management, and tourism management. Whether students are learning how to manage a
restaurant, gaining mountain adventure skills, or exploring the world of outdoor recreation and tourism management,
tomorrow’s workforce is being prepared by skilled instructors with solid industry experience.
Through these educational opportunities, tourism professionals can earn a range of credentials and certifications that
not only boost their confidence, but have proven benefits to employers seeking fresh ideas and potential leaders for
their organizations.

Chapter 9. Customer Service | 223

Conclusion

Figure 9.12 A satisfied customer shares the news on his mobile
device

BC tourism and hospitality employers named customer service as the most beneficial training topic in a number of
surveys. These skills are integral to customer satisfaction, employee engagement, organizational performance, and a
destination’s competitive position (Freeman, 2011; Tourism Vancouver Island, 2010).
Employers can either commit to creating a learning organization or undermine their business depending on their
investment (or lack thereof) in training. Essentially, employers get out of training what they put into it, often by
attracting and retaining better, more motivated employees. Ultimately, this investment results in a better customer
experience with improved levels of customer loyalty and organizational profitability. Prudent employees seek employers
who value investment in training.
We know there are a variety of ways to ensure quality of service and recover when things go wrong. A key factor of
success is understanding that customers want to be listened to — they would like an apology, a solution, at times
compensation, and often follow-up and reassurance. And when a complaint is expertly handled, the customer can be
converted from a potential social media detractor to a loyal advocate for the business.
From the first wave of training that prepared BC to host Expo 86, to communities and businesses participating

224 | Chapter 9. Customer Service

in WorldHost workshops today, tourism in our province is only as strong as the front-line employees that deliver
experiences to guests.
Another key component in BC’s ability to compete as a tourism destination is its reputation for healthy wildlife, wild
viewscapes, and pristine resources. Chapter 10 highlights the important role the tourism industry can play in either
preserving, or damaging, our natural assets.

Case Study: Accent Inn and WorldHost Training Service

Accent Inns is an award-winning, family-owned and operated company based in Victoria with hotels located
in Victoria, Richmond, Burnaby, Kelowna, and Kamloops. All Accent Inns have developed a reputation for their
quality, reasonable rates, and excellent service. Guest and staff satisfaction are key components of their service
culture to treat every guest like family. The team at Accent Inns put great effort into making every customer
interaction memorable.
In 2013, Accent Inns committed to incorporating customer service training at each property to be delivered
by Accent Inns assistant general managers (AGMs). Core outcomes were to raise the level of service, empower
front-line staff with the tools to exceed guest expectations, and strengthen the facilitation and coaching skills
of the AGM team. Building on the business’s existing training culture and strong corporate values, WorldHost
Training Services created a customized half-day program for the AGMs to use in their hotels.
To prepare, the AGMs completed an experiential 1.5-day train-the-trainer session. An emphasis on coaching
support and a team facilitation approach led many to gain confidence in this new role. One trainer excelled
and was selected as the full-time trainer for Accent Inns. Working with the human resources team from Accent
Inns, WorldHost also completed a needs analysis at each property to ensure staff had input into future training.
Training continues to be developed and delivered internally.
According to Kathy Gaudry, human resources manager for Accent Inns, “The WorldHost team was fantastic; they
worked hard to ensure the training was completely relevant to our employees and our culture. The results were
phenomenal — our junior leaders have acquired the skills they need to deliver training locally to their own teams
— we couldn’t be happier.”
Visit the Accent Inns website (www.accentinns.com) and review the information to answer the following
questions about their customer service culture:
1. What kind of experience do you expect by reading the website’s information and looking at the pictures?
What kind of service do you feel the inns provide?
2. Visit TripAdvisor (TripAdvisor.com) and look up any of the Accent Inn locations.
1. Select a review for families. What does the reviewer say about the property? How does Accent Inns
respond?
2. Select a review for solo travellers. What does the reviewer say about the property? How does
Accent Inns respond?
3. Are there any negative reviews? If so, how does Accent Inns respond?
3. Now that you’ve reviewed the case study, the website, and TripAdvisor for Accent Inns, use the RATER
dimensions to provide examples of how Accent Inns is using the SERVQUAL model.

Overview

Figure 10.1 A foraging black bear is photographed by a tourist on a wildlife viewing trip. Protecting BC’s
natural assets is paramount to maintaining the province’s tourism product.

One of the main reasons people travel is to visit areas that are unspoiled, natural, beautiful, or unique in terms of their
local environment. Unfortunately, through our actions either as tourism businesses or as visitors, we risk damaging
230 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

the natural environments we depend on (Hardin, 1968; Williams & Ponsford, 2008). For this reason, environmental
stewardship in tourism is of paramount importance.
Environmental stewardship can be defined as “the responsible use (including conservation) of natural resources in a
way that takes full and balanced account of the interests of society, future generations, and other species, as well as of
private needs, and accepts significant answerability to society” (Worrell & Appleby, 2000, p. 263).
This chapter explores the concept of environmental stewardship, the impacts of tourism on the natural environment
(and vice versa), and ways we can minimize these impacts.

History of Environmental Stewardship
The topic of stewardship entered public consciousness in the middle of the last century in the works of writers such as
Aldo Leopard (A Sand Country Almanac), Garret Hardin (The Tragedy of the Commons), and Rachel Carson (Silent Spring).
Building on this growing consciousness, the concept of sustainability and sustainable development was introduced.
One of the first commonly accepted definitions of sustainable development came from the World Commission on
Environment and Development, later renamed the Brundtland Commission. It defined sustainable development as
meeting “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”
(Brundtland, 1987, p. 41). Sustainable development differs from environmental stewardship in that it may include aspects
of social, economic and environmental sustainability, whereas environmental stewardship focuses solely on the natural
world.
A related concept is environmental management, where the natural resources of the environment are managed
through policies designed to protect natural values while providing a framework for use. In tourism, this management
may be the responsibility of many groups including individual operators, tourism industry organizations, nongovernmental organizations, or government agencies (Mercer, 2004; Williams & Ponsford, 2008).

Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 231

The Need for Change
Experts around the world agree that the need for stewardship has never been greater, as there exists
overwhelming evidence that the environment is being irrevocably damaged by human actions. Climate change caused
by increased greenhouse gas emissions (World Tourism Organization, 2008a) and the loss of biodiversity due to
declining habitat loss are just two compelling issues.
Tourism continues to grow globally, and many tourists are in pursuit of pristine, natural environments. Development of
tourism products results in increased urbanization, overuse, exceeding carrying capacity, and contamination of natural
resources (Williams & Ponsford, 2008). Later in this chapter, we’ll provide several examples of specific tourism and
hospitality impacts and approaches to mitigating them.
There is one issue that takes precedence over all others: climate change. The next section focuses specifically on
this critical global issue and its relationship to the tourism industry.

Tourism and Climate Change

Figure 10.3 Helms Glacier melting

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded the “observed increase in global average
temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely (> 90% probability) the result of human activities that are
increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere” (World Tourism Organization, 2008a, p. 38). Climate
change should be considered to be one of the most important challenges currently facing the tourism industry.

232 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

Take a Closer Look: Climate Change and Tourism
The report entitled Climate Change and Tourism: Responding to Global Challenges, published by the World
Tourism Organization (2008b), discusses the implications of climate change to the global tourism industry.
It also suggests climate change adaption measures to be undertaken. Find the full report at Climate Change
and Tourism: Responding to Global Challenges [PDF]: http://sdt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/
climate2008.pdf

Impacts of Climate Change
According to the World Tourism Organization, impacts from climate change on tourism include (2008a):
Direct climate impacts are changes that occur as a result of warming trends, cooling trends, or extreme weather events.
Examples include a lack of snow to operate mountain resorts, melting glaciers in mountainous regions, and floods,
landslides, and wildfires that could affect tourist areas.

Figure 10.4 The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which destroyed large sections of coastline in New York
and New Jersey, including popular tourist attraction Coney Island (seen in the distance)

Indirect environmental change impacts are the byproducts of climate change. Global temperature changes may create
water shortages, a loss of biodiversity, impacts to landscape aesthetics, and damage to infrastructure through extreme
weather events. Examples in tourism include the inability to maintain resort facilities in desert environments due to
water shortages, erosion of tropical atolls from rising sea levels, extinction of valuable wildlife species due to changes in
habitat, and increased costs of maintaining infrastructure in the face of environmental change.
Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 233

Impacts of mitigation policies on tourist mobility will become apparent as the tourism industry adjusts to environmental
changes. Environmental impact mitigation strategies may create challenges for the long-term sustainability of the
tourism industry. Tourism products may be offered over a shorter season, prices may increase due to a rise in operating
costs, and there may be a shortage of pristine natural areas available for visits.
Indirect societal change impacts will slowly become apparent. Economic growth may be stunted in some areas and
increase in others, creating societal inequality between nations. Political instability may arise in areas that are facing
drastic environmental impact. All these changes will present new challenges to the industry and may threaten the longterm security of the industry (Watson, Zinyowera, & Moss, 1997; World Tourism Organization, 2008a).
Table 10.1 provides a detailed list of these impacts and their implications for tourism, as compiled by the World Tourism
Organization.

Data source: World Tourism Organization, 2008a, p.61

To understand how we might begin to address these impacts and other environmental issues, it’s helpful to understand
the fundamentals of environmental stewardship theory, which is explored in the next section.

234 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

Environmental Stewardship Theory
Some basic concepts of environmental management and ethics, especially as they apply to tourism, include carrying
capacity, footprint, tragedy of the commons, and the tourism paradox.

Carrying Capacity
Carrying capacity is “the average maximum number of individuals of a given species that can occupy a particular habitat
without permanently impairing the productive capacity of that habitat” (Rees, 2001, p. 229).

Figure 10.5 A tourist’s snapshot of a “full moon party” in Thailand, where bottles, trash, and
human waste litter the beach for days afterward, and noise and light pollution are common

This concept has been applied to tourism in the context of a tourism carrying capacity (TCC), “the maximum number
of visitors which an area can sustain without unacceptable deterioration of the physical environment and without
considerably diminishing user satisfaction” (Salerno, Viviano, Manfredi, Caroli, Thankuri, & Tartari, 2013, p. 116).

Take a Closer Look: Vehicle Congestion in Banff National Park
In late 2014, the Town of Banff approved $70,000 to study the feasibility of introducing a gondola network to
connect the Banff Centre, the Banff Springs Hotel, the Upper Hot Springs, and the existing mountain gondola.
That summer the town experienced 54 days of congestion that exceeded its threshold of 20,000 vehicles per

Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 235

day, with vehicle waits and idle times of up to 1.5 hours during peak periods. To learn more about the issue
and proposed solutions, read “Banff Considers Potential of Gondola Network”: http://calgaryherald.com/
business/local-business/banff-considers-potential-of-gondola-network

There are many examples of TCC being applied in tourism globally. In Canada, national parks use the concept to ensure
visitor numbers are restricted to a sustainable level. Studies of tourism in the Cayman Islands indicate this destination
may soon be exceeding its TCC. Although TCC is a theoretical concept that is often discussed and utilized for analysis,
in reality it can be challenging to restrict the numbers of tourists arriving at a destination.

Footprint
Ecological footprint is essentially a tool to analyze the impact of a population on Earth (Rees, 2001). The model
calculates the total area of land and water resources used to support the population, presenting it in a manner that can
be easily related to — usually in terms of the amount of land needed to support an individual at the standard of living
that person is used to.
Typically, residents of industrialized, developed nations (such as Canada) require a larger land area to support their
lifestyle than residents of developing nations, who have smaller ecological footprints due to lower consumption.

Tragedy of the Commons
Tragedy of the commons is an economic theory first proposed by Garrett Hardin in 1968, which states that if individuals
are given the chance to overuse a common property, they will, in order to realize the maximum personal benefits. If
every person does this, common property quickly becomes overused and damaged (Hardin, 1968).
For example, a group of tourism operators may look at a pristine natural area and see a chance for economic profit,
and in the race for development, little or nothing is done to protect the area. If this unchecked development were to
continue, the damage to the environment could reach a point where the elements that attracted tourists in the first
place are irreversibly damaged, thus resulting in the “tragedy” that Hardin discusses (Hardin, 1968).
The tragedy of the commons leads to something known as the tourism paradox, a concept that describes the
paradoxical nature of tourism’s relationship with the environment.

236 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

The Tourism Paradox

Figure 10.6 BC’s tourism assets centre heavily on scenery. Here is the Coastal Range and oceanfront are
seen together from Neck Point Park near Nanaimo.

A common theme promoted by many tourism destinations is their location in some of the most ecologically fragile
environments in existence — coastal, mountain, and river environments (Williams & Ponsford, 2008). Tourism requires
these areas to be intact to serve as an attraction to visitors. Tourists expect a clean physical environment, appropriate
seasonal conditions, and diversity of wildlife. Destinations failing to provide at least some of these elements risk losing
their competitive edge in the global market; visitors will steer clear of polluted, barren landscapes with unpredictable or
uncomfortable weather.

Spotlight On: The Resort Municipality of Whistler
The community of Whistler relies heavily on natural resources for its local tourism products, such as
skiing, and has long been active in sustainability initiatives. The plan, Whistler 2020, sets out integrated
community strategies for enhancing community life, enhancing the resort experience, ensuring economic
viability, protecting the environment, and partnering for success. For more information about the plan
and Whistler’s progress with these initiatives, visit Whistler 2020: www.whistler.ca/municipal-government/
strategies-and-plans/whistler2020

At the same time, the tourism industry is itself causing environmental damage through its own development in pristine
areas, consumption of resources, and contribution to climate change. This is the paradox: as an industry, tourism
both creates damage and suffers from it. That’s why it’s critical for the industry to be proactive about environmental
sustainability in tourism; failing to do so may result in our downfall (Williams & Ponsford, 2008).
Before we gain a better understanding of the ways the tourism industry and individual operators can try to mitigate
their impacts, let’s take a closer look at the overall management of BC’s environmental resources.
Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 237

Environmental Management in BC
Environmental impacts in BC are managed by a variety of governmental organizations, primarily at the provincial
or federal level. Each of these agencies has a role to play, from regulation of land access and resource extraction
to environmental monitoring and cleanup. To understand how the impacts are managed, let’s review the basic categories
of land use in BC.

Land Use
There are essentially four broad land categories in BC: private land, provincial Crown land, federal Crown land, and First
Nations land.
Private land in BC is any land where private property rights apply. This includes residential, commercial, and
agricultural zoned land throughout the province. If private property rights apply, the owner has more rights over that
land for development and use than any other classification of land. Tourism companies wishing to operate on private
property need to gain ownership of the land, or failing that, permission to operate on the land. Private property accounts
for approximately 5% of the land mass in BC (Government of BC, 2011).
The term Crown land applies to any land that is owned by either the provincial or federal government. Provincial Crown
land makes up 94% of BC, making it the largest category of land in the province. Provincial Crown land is available
for a wide range of activities that encourage recreation and economic development, including tourism (Government of
BC, 2011).

Figure 10.7 A BC Parks ranger conducts an interpretive program

Designated park areas are managed by BC Parks, the agency that reviews and issues permits for tourism companies to

238 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

operate within a park. Other provincial Crown land is managed by a variety of government agencies, such as the Ministry
of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations (MFLNR).
Federal Crown land is all land that is owned by the Government of Canada; in BC, less than 1% of the overall land
is federal Crown land. It primarily consists of parks and protected areas that are managed by Parks Canada, the
federal agency that has a mandate to preserve and share “natural and cultural heritage” and help ensure enjoyment and
appreciation “for present and future generations” (Parks Canada, n.d.).

Take a Closer Look: Parks and Protected Areas in BC
Two examples of pristine parks in BC are Pacific Rim National Park and Garibaldi Provincial Park. Pacific Rim
is operated by Parks Canada. It covers a beautiful stretch of land along the west coast of Vancouver Island.
Visit the webpage at Pacific Rim National Park Reserve: parkscanada.gc.ca/pacrim
Garibaldi is managed by BC Parks. It is located just north of Vancouver and protects a pristine mountainous
region. Learn more at Garibaldi Provincial Park: www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/garibaldi/.
Both parks serve as significant natural attractions for tourism in BC.

First Nations land includes any area where Aboriginal title has been established and responsibilities for management
lie with the relevant First Nations group. Large areas of designated Crown land in BC are considered by First Nations
groups as traditional, and these are currently going through the treaty negotiation process, which will likely result in a
larger proportion of the BC land area coming under First Nations management.

Land Use for Tourism and Hospitality
Businesses and organizations wishing to use Crown land for economic development must apply and be approved for
Crown land tenure, which is an agreement with the BC government to use the land for commercial purposes. Examples
of the types of tourism operations that might seek tenure include mountain resorts, golf courses, backcountry lodges,
tour operators, resort development, and marina construction. It’s estimated that about 16% of the tourism industry in
BC depends on access to Crown land through the Crown land tenure program (Government of BC, 2010).
Different tenures are available depending on the type, location, and intensity of use proposed. A temporary permit
grants use for approved activities for up to two years, but not exclusive use (other commercial operators may still
use the area). A licence of occupation, the next level of tenure, provides for light development (e.g., semi-permanent
structures or trails). This type of licence is typically issued for terms of five to 30 years and is renewable. A lease is a
long-term contract for tenure, typically for 30 years. With a lease, operators can make substantial improvements to the
land including significant structures such as lodges, restaurants, ski lifts, roads, and so on. It is the longest term and the
most secure type of tenure (Government of BC, 2010).
Any tourism business wishing to operate on First Nations land requires permission from the local First Nations
band. Companies wanting to operate in a national park also need to apply for a permit. Although resource extraction
is restricted, national parks often encourage tourism development that is sustainable and appropriate for the local
environment.

Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 239

Environmental Protection and Assessment
Other elements of environmental stewardship in BC fall to the Ministry of Environment. This ministry has five
divisions: Environmental Protection, Environmental Sustainability and Strategic Policy, Parks and Protected Areas,
Climate Action Secretariat, and Conservation Officer Service. These divisions are responsible for environmental cleanup
and spill response, climate change initiatives, protected areas management, and wildlife (British Columbia Ministry of
Environment, n.d.a). This applies to all individuals and commercial enterprises in BC, including tourism.
Additionally, the Environmental Assessment Office plays an important role in environmental stewardship on Crown
lands in BC. All major projects being proposed for development on Crown land must undergo an environmental
assessment and have it approved by this office, which is a neutral agency set up specifically for this purpose. Projects
are evaluated not only for their potential impacts on the environment, but also on their economic, social, cultural,
and heritage aspects. Large-scale tourism projects such as mountain resorts are required to proceed through the
environmental assessment process (Environmental Assessment Office, n.d.).

Figure 10.8 Logging sites visible from the air in Jervis Inlet

The current land management system in BC has led to numerous conflicts between tourism operators and resource
240 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

extraction operations such as mining and forestry. Often, overlapping tenure is given to multiple companies with
conflicting operational goals. Tourism operators typically require a clean environment, high-quality viewscapes, intact
biodiversity, and an environment free of industrial scars. To maintain these values, any resource extraction needs to
occur far from where tourism operators conduct their activities. In recent years, tensions have been building as access
to wilderness areas becomes scarcer, with tourism values often falling second to resource extraction under the existing
system (Webster, 2013).

Take a Closer Look: Conflicts Between Tourism and Resource Extraction in BC
Tourism companies complain that despite being part of the $1.6 billion nature-based tourism industry in BC,
the government favours traditional logging values. This article discusses one example on northern Vancouver
Island where a kayaking operator feels logging is threatening its livelihood. Learn more by reading the article,
“Logging Threatens Tourism, Kayaking Company Charges”: www.pressreader.com/canada/the-vancouversun/20150103/281599533867296

The issues discussed above provide a framework for thinking about environmental management and the impacts of the
tourism industry in BC. As part of the industry, we have an important responsibility to recognize impacts and take steps
to reduce them. The next section addresses how we might do just that.

Mitigating Tourism and Hospitality Impacts

Figure 10.9 Moose tracks on Liard River in northern BC

Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 241

In recent years in BC, the tourism industry has felt the impacts of climate change, habitat destruction, biodiversity loss,
and increased conflicts over the use of natural areas. The winters of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 were two of the warmest
on record, and numerous low-elevation coastal mountain resorts were forced to close in the middle of the winter season
(Hager, 2015). As well, the province is experiencing increased pressure on endangered wildlife species that draw tourists
and residents alike. The death of an orca whale off the coast of Vancouver Island in late 2014 raised questions of water
pollution and contamination (Theodore, 2014).

Take a Closer Look: The Future of Mountain Resorts
With their dependence on quality snow conditions for guests, ski areas will likely be among the first to be
impacted by climate change. Read an article on this topic from the Tyee, “Peak Snow? BC Ski Resorts Brace
for Warmer Era”: thetyee.ca/News/2014/12/22/Peak-Snow-Ski-Resorts/

In the face of this negative environmental news, there are a variety of initiatives underway that have the potential to
implement real change. These include:
• Carbon offsetting
• Energy conservation
• Water conservation
• Food production management
• Waste management
• Accreditation
This section explores these potential solutions.

Carbon Offsetting
Carbon offsetting is a standardized, regulated system that provides organizations with the ability to invest in green
initiatives that will counterbalance their emissions, hence creating a carbon neutral situation (David Suzuki Foundation,
2009).
The concept of carbon offsetting stems from a recognition that despite a desire to entirely eliminate carbon emissions,
sometimes doing so isn’t immediately feasible. Consequently, carbon offsetting has proven popular with tourism
companies that can offset some or all of their emissions, either by themselves or by providing the opportunity for
customers to do so. Examples are most commonly found in the transportation sector, where the reliance on traditional
fossil fuels makes it challenging to completely eliminate carbon emissions.

242 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

Figure 10.10 A detail from the side of a Harbour Air seaplane

Take Harbour Air, for instance, a small BC airline. Since 2007, the company has completely offset all of the emissions
produced by its airplanes by investing in energy-efficiency and fuel-switching projects in BC. The cost of the projects is
passed on to passengers through a small levy added to the ticket price, and despite the cost increase, passenger traffic
increased by 12% to 15% in the following year (Offsetters, n.d.).

Carbon offsetting isn’t just for the transportation sector, however. Tinhorn Creek Winery in Oliver has become a tourism
destination for wine and culinary tourists and has some innovative conservation concepts. In addition to having an
offsetting program, the winery runs its vehicles on biodiesel. It also holds virtual tastings with travel media over the web
(media obtain samples of the product ahead of time), eliminating travel to the Okanagan to have a Tinhorn experience.
The property remains dedicated to exploring sustainability concepts as its survival is based on mitigating climate change
and the negative effects of drastic weather changes on wine production (Tinhorn Creek Winery, 2014).

Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 243

Energy Conservation
Despite the relatively low cost of electricity in BC, it benefits all operators to do their part by reducing consumption and
greenhouse gas emissions. Not only is this the right thing to do for the physical environment, it’s also a means to save
money.
For example, the Four Seasons in Vancouver reduced their electricity consumption by 4,000 megawatt hours in the
period between fall 2012 and spring 2014. They did this by installing timers and photocells on lights, auditing appliances,
ensuring proper maintenance of the furnace and HVAC systems, and cleaning light fixtures and fans so these operated
at their best. The energy reduction represented a savings of $135,000 for the property (Hui, 2014).

Take a Closer Look: Energy Conservation in the Hospitality Sector
BC Hydro’s PowerSmart program for businesses has helped operators large and small — from BC Ferries to
the Pear Tree Restaurant in Burnaby — to reduce their footprint and save money. Read success stories, check
out helpful tools, and learn more about the program by visiting Hospitality: Increase profits by reducing
energy costs: www.bchydro.com/powersmart/business/types-of-business-customers/hospitality.html

BC Ferries is another organization that has realized energy savings. It did this with the help of BC Hydro education
programs and incentives, retrofitting lighting and installing radiant heat in a workshop and toll booths. These efforts
yielded an energy savings of over 335 megawatt hours in one year. That represents enough energy to power 31 average
homes over the same time period (BC Hydro, 2013).

244 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

Water Conservation

Figure 10.11 A hiker comes across surging fresh water from a “pineapple express” storm on BC’s coast

British Columbia is home to 25% of Canada’s fresh water, and so to many it appears that water conservation is not an
issue in the province. However, water is not evenly distributed across regions, nor is it equally available all seasons of the
year (BC Ministry of Environment, n.d.b). This is especially evident on Salt Spring Island, a popular tourist destination
with numerous small accommodation properties. The island experiences water shortages in the peak summer season
when lake and groundwater levels drop and demand is highest.
In 2006, a number of local water conservation groups on Salt Spring Island surveyed 117 accommodation providers
to determine what measures might be taken to alleviate the summer pressure on freshwater systems. They were
pleasantly surprised to find that several properties had already taken steps, including installing low-flow toilets and flow
restrictors on shower heads, requiring minimum two-night stays (which reduces the amount of laundry required), and
offering visitor education campaigns. The combined efforts of properties on the island have proven to make a significant
difference to the collective capacity of 1,500 guests per night (O’Callaghan, 2006).

Food Production and the Environment
As discussed in Chapter 4 on food and beverage services, there is increasing awareness among the general public
about the importance of healthful eating. This goes hand in hand with an increased understanding of food production
issues including environmental impacts such as pollution, soil depletion, and the toxicity (both to humans and the
environment) of industrial food growth practices. Over the last 30 years, American (and to an extent, Canadian)
food growth has centred on the mass production of inexpensive staple foods such as corn and soy, which are used
Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 245

in unhealthy foods like high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil, and are fed to the animals we eat (University of
Minnesota, 2009).

Spotlight On: Island Chefs Collaborative
The Island Chefs Collaborative (ICC) is an organization that supports connections between local agriculture
and the food and beverage industry. Its vision is a local and sustainable food and agriculture system for
Vancouver Island. For more information, visit the Island Chefs Collaborative website: www.iccbc.ca

Farming mass amounts of one crop is known as monoculture, a practice that depletes the soil and encourages the use
of pesticides and fertilizers for increased production. The impacts of these chemicals to date include the creation of
a “dead zone” at the outflow of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, where no fish or other animals can live
(University of Minnesota, 2009).
The soil in which food is grown is becoming less rich as commercial fertilizers focus only on building specific
nutrients. Combined with the long distances that foods are shipped (sometimes causing nutrients to be depleted),
consumers are becoming wary of commercially produced foods (University of Minnesota, 2009).

The 100-Mile Diet and Farm to Table
In 2005, two BC-based journalists, J.B. MacKinnon and Alisa Smith, began chronicling the challenges of only eating food
produced within 100 miles of their homes, as part of a serial of articles for the Tyee. Their posts became a book, The
100-Mile Diet, launched in 2007 and heralded as a vanguard of the local food movement (Tyee, 2005).

Spotlight On: Circle Farm Tour
Created through a partnership between destination marketing organizations in the Fraser Valley
communities of Abbotsford, Chilliwack, Agassiz-Harrison, and Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows, the Circle Farm
Tour brings awareness to farming practices and farmland conservation while creating a collaborative tourism
product. Self-guided tours are made possible through a series of branded maps, brochures, and a central
website. For more information, visit the Circle Farm Tour website: http://circlefarmtour.com

Organizations such as FarmFolk CityFolk, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to food sustainability in the province,
have been promoting farm-to-table dining for over 20 years. Their efforts include working with restaurants to bring
quality ingredients to the sector, and hosting annual events that celebrate the “feast of fields” in regions such as the
Okanagan (FarmFolk CityFolk, 2014).

246 | Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship

Waste Management

Figure 10.12 A food scraps bin ready for composting, collected at a
Vancouver farmer’s market

In 2012 in BC, the amount of garbage generated was equivalent to 570 kilograms per person. With landfills and treatment
sites filling to capacity (and sometimes beyond), it’s imperative that communities and businesses work together in the
practice of proper waste management through implementing recycling programs, reducing garbage, properly treating
industrial and hazardous waste, and treating sewage and wastewater (Government of BC, n.d.).
One very effective means of reducing garbage taken to the landfill is implementing a food waste program in which
food scraps are placed in a green bin and collected by the community for composting. The City of Vancouver initially
introduced such a program to single family households from 2011 to 2013 and saw a 30% drop in garbage generated.
In 2014, the program was expanded to include all households and businesses and placed a ban on food scraps in the
garbage. The program met resistance from the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association, which viewed the initiative
as placing an extra cost and being a logistical challenge for members (Nagel, 2014). Individual restaurateurs were hopeful,
however, that the city would help businesses by increasing pickup and expanding the efficiency of their other recycling
programs (Robinson, 2014).

Accreditation and Certification
Environmental accreditation or certification is a type of voluntary regulation where an organization agrees to follow
a set of standards, predefined processes, or regulations. These are generally developed by independent nongovernmental organizations with a goal of reducing the environmental impact within an industry. Accreditation can
encompass any of the practices discussed so far — from carbon offsetting to energy and water conservation to waste
management.
Beyond the value of making the ethical decision of working to reduce environmental impacts, organizations receive
value by being able to promote themselves as being environmentally friendly and therefore attracting consumers (Font,
2002). And for guests, choosing an independently accredited business may help them avoid companies that are guilty
Chapter 10. Environmental Stewardship | 247

of greenwashing, which is the promotion of environmentally friendly tourism products without actually achieving the
environmental standard promised (Lelenicz & Simoni, 2012; Self, Self, & Bell-Haynes, 2010).

Spotlight On: Green Key Global
Green Key Global is an international certification body that evaluates the accommodations and meetings
industries on the basis of their sustainable initiatives. Headquartered in Ontario, its Green Key Eco-Rating
Program awards from 1 to 5 keys to hotels, with 47 properties currently holding the highest rating. Green
Key Global conducts an on-site assessment and provides operators with suggestions for improving their
sustainability efforts. Awarded keys are then used as marketing and promotional tools. A similar program
serves the meetings and events sector. For more information, visit the Green Key Global website:
http://greenkeyglobal.com

Organizations join such programs voluntarily. This typically involves going through an audit to prove adherence to a set
of environmental standards (Font, 2002). Generally, an audit consists of an independent third party visiting a business
or operation and reviewing its practices against a checklist of standards; those that pass earn the certification or
accreditation.
It is estimated that over 100 different tourism environmental certification programs exist, each with different standards
and criteria (Self, Self, & Bell-Haynes, 2010).

Spotlight On: Green Tourism Canada
Green Tourism Canada is an environmental tourism certification program where tourism operators are
assessed for adherence to sustainability principles. It offers ongoing support and consultation so that
operators may work to achieve a high level of environmental sustainability. For more information, visit Green
Tourism Canada: www.greentourismcanada.ca

Whether it be through carbon offsetting, energy and water conservation, increased use of local and organic food
products, or official accreditation programs, the tourism industry has a number of options for lessening the impacts of
businesses on the physical environment.

Conclusion
Numerous studies suggest society will face increasing pressure for scarce resources and a changing natural
environment due to habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change (Hardin, 1968; Mercer, 2004; Williams & Ponsford,
2008; Wong, 2004; World Tourism Organization, 2008b). The tourism industry must recognize its considerable
contribution to this global challenge and take aggressive steps to mitigate the impacts.

On a global scale, the tourism industry needs to recognize its release of significant carbon emissions and explore ways to
reduce these while maintaining the mobility needed for travel. On a local scale, tourism stakeholders need to recognize
the risk they pose to the destruction of local pristine environments and take steps to ensure the sustainability of their
operations. Only by working together can we ensure a future for tourism and our society as a whole.
This chapter has addressed a major risk to the tourism industry — the threat of environmental impacts and disasters on
businesses and communities. Chapter 11 addresses the concept of risk management and legal liability in the industry.

Case Study: Jumbo Mountain Resort

Jumbo Mountain Resort near Invermere has long been one of the most controversial tourism developments
in BC. Proponents claim that it will add a world-class skiing resort product to the economy. Opponents argue
that the environmental impacts are not worth the limited economic return it offers, including threatening grizzly
bears and other sensitive species (Lavoie, 2014).
The planning process for the resort has taken over 20 years with initial permits issued in 2004. Since then
the project faced several delays in order to clear conditions of its environmental assessment. In December 2014,
the project was delayed again as the government asked for more time to evaluate whether the newly poured
foundations for lodge buildings were located in avalanche zones (Shaw, 2014).
Conduct your own research about Jumbo Mountain Resort using a minimum of three sources, and answer the
questions below.
1. What are some of the environmental impacts listed by those opposed to the resort?
2. How might these impacts be mitigated? What steps is the company taking to do this?
3. In addition to environmental impacts and avalanche risk, have there been there any other challenges to
the resort?
4. Given documented record warm temperatures and low snowfall in other resort areas of the province, and
the currently relatively stable snow conditions at Jumbo, do you think it’s a good long-term investment?
Why or why not?
5. What is the progress of the project today? Do a scan of social media and news sites and try to determine
where public opinion lies.
6. How is the company responding to critics regarding its environmental stewardship strategies? What
platforms is it using to communicate?

DON WEBSTER

Learning Objectives

• Define the concepts of risk and risk management
• Apply the four steps of a risk management process to a tourism operation
• Identify potential liabilities and develop mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of these
• Identify the four elements of a negligent action
• Describe the components of a valid contract under Canadian contract law
• Appraise the statutory requirements for a tourism or hospitality operator as required in BC
• Demonstrate a working knowledge of occupational health and safety in tourism

Overview
This chapter examines the concepts of risk management and legal liability in tourism and hospitality. We’ll review
theoretical risk concepts and practical risk management applications while exploring applicable areas of statute, tort,
and contract law. Insurance and occupational health and safety are also discussed. Examples are provided that apply
to principles of risk management for tourism and hospitality operations. Please note that the advice and definitions
provided in this chapter are general, and should not be relied on in the case of legal action. They will, however, provide
a foundation for working in the tourism industry, and for further study.

What is Risk Management?
Risk is defined as the potential for loss or harm (Canadian Tourism Commission [CTC], 2003a). This could be a financial
loss, damage to property, or injury to workers or guests. Understandably, most tourism operators are interested in
avoiding these impacts to their operation, which is why risk management is needed.

Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability | 255

Figure 11.1 Signage indicates a risk for people wanting to fish
in this stream near Waneta, BC due to turbulent flows and
rapidly rising water levels.

Risk management refers to the practices, policies, and procedures designed to minimize or eliminate unacceptable risks
(Cloutier, 2000; CTC, 2003a; Heshka & Jackson, 2011). Depending on the type of operation and the industry undertaking
the risk management process, these may vary greatly. Consequently, it is helpful to think of risk management as
being a process of determining the exposure to risk, and then initiating action to either minimize or eliminate the risk
(Enterprise Risk Management, 2004).

Why Practise Risk Management?
There are two main reasons for tourism operators to practise risk management: to avoid injury to guests and employees,
and to protect their business operations from financial or physical ruin.
Keeping guests and employees safe is a moral and ethical responsibility of operators and includes avoiding both
emotional and physical harm. Protecting business operations includes protecting against damage to property, damage
to reputation, and any financial impacts occurring from litigation (Centre for Curriculum, Transfer, and Technology
[CCTT], 2003a). By practising this twofold approach, operators demonstrate that they are are prioritizing the health and
safety of individuals, while still taking steps to protect the operational sustainability of their company.

256 | Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability

Figure 11.2 All eyes of the media could be on a business if it has not effectively managed risk.

On a larger scale, practising effective risk management can be seen as an important business skill. The Canadian Tourism
Commission (2003a) suggests that risk management:
• Reduces the likelihood of an unwanted and unplanned event
• Reduces the consequences of the event
• Enhances your ability to access comprehensive and cost-effective insurance
Risk management can be undertaken at any scale. Individuals, companies, societies, communities, cities, regions,
and even governments can follow the process in order to protect themselves from risks, which may range from
company-specific risks such as disruption of revenue to significant international risks such as climate change and civil
disturbances.
Some risk management initiatives are easier than others; they are required by law and enforced by government agencies.
For example, companies providing public transportation (such as passenger transport in a bus) have clearly defined
requirements as set out by their local motor vehicle branch in government. They are required to use appropriately
licensed drivers, submit to commercial vehicle inspections, and insure their vehicles as required. Failing to adhere to
these standards may result in suspension of operating privileges, fines, or even imprisonment.
However, other aspects of risk management are not regulated so extensively. This is characteristic of the majority
of tourism and hospitality activities offered in Canada today. Operators offer services to the general public and selfregulate in terms of safety. If injury to a guest occurs, and that guest feels that he or she has grounds for a financial claim,
that person can initiate a lawsuit against the tourism operator. If this claim is found valid in court, then the tourism
operator may have to pay a large financial settlement to that claimant.
In short, tour operators must comply with applicable statutory requirements and be sure to self-monitor to determine
if the standard that they are operating at is acceptable to society and their peers. Failing to do so may result in a
range of consequences including fines, suspension of operations, or a lawsuit. Clearly, risk management for tourism and
hospitality is a complicated process.

Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability | 257

Concepts of Risk
Before we proceed deeper into an examination of the risk management process, let’s look at three theoretical concepts
of risk: real risk, perceived risk, and inherent risk.
Real risk is the actual statistical likelihood of an incident occurring. This is established through reviews of statistics and
other relevant data, and by an analytical process and use of expertise in the field. There is little ambiguity or subjectivity
in real risk (CTC, 2003a).
Perceived risk is the perception of risk by those undertaking or evaluating something; it may vary greatly based on their
level of apprehension, anxiety, or experience with the specific risk. Perceived risk can also vary greatly from the real
risk of an activity; it can be higher or lower than the actual risk. Successful management of perceived risk may include
operators promoting the risk of activity as high, even if in reality the risk is minimal. This strategy can ensure successful
delivery of an exhilarating, challenging experience while remaining safety conscious (Dowling, 1986).
Inherent risk is the risk that must exist for the activity to occur; examples include the risk of drowning when swimming
and the risk of falling during skiing. It is impossible to eliminate inherent risk from these activities because it would
preclude participating in them. However, operators should take steps to minimize inherent risk; this could include, for
example, providing appropriate safety equipment for guests, training staff, and informing participants of the hazards of
the activity (CCTC, 2003b).

Risk Management Process
A variety of risk management models exist, all of them generally a variation on the same theme, with each having a
slightly different analytical approach. Here we outline the model from the Canadian Tourism Commission for small and
medium enterprises. It has four stages: risk identification, risk analysis, risk control, and risk treatment (CTC, 2003a).

Risk Identification
The first stage of the risk management process is systematically identifying risks facing the organization. This step is
often referred to as risk assessment. An organization can identify risks in the following ways (CTC, 2003a, p. 6):

258 | Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability

• On-site inspections and discussions with management and staff
• Review of products, services, processes, and contracts
• Review of historical activities and losses
• Identification of possible risk scenarios
Once an exhaustive list of the risks is compiled, the next step is to ensure a thorough analysis occurs.

Risk Analysis
A typical risk analysis compares the probability (frequency) of any risks occurring by the consequence (severity) if they
do occur. This can be done either in a qualitative or quantitative manner, with either numerical values or descriptors
applied. For example, an analysis of the risk of the catastrophic failure of a ski lift at a resort resulting in passengers
falling to the ground would likely indicate that the probability of this incident occurring is low due to required safety
checks and maintenance. However, the consequence would likely be high, considering there could be many visitors
involved in a significant fall, resulting in multiple casualties.
Operators need to respond (through risk control, see below) if the analysis determines any of the following: 1) the
probability of the risk occurring is unacceptable; 2) the consequence of the risk occurring is unacceptable; or 3) the
combined impact of the probability and consequence is deemed unacceptable (Cloutier, 2000).

Figure 11.4 Safety equipment required to zip-line

Risk Control
Once the risks are identified and analyzed, the next step is implementing mitigation strategies for any unacceptable
risks. This step is risk control, and it comprises two primary concepts: exposure avoidance and loss reduction.
Exposure avoidance involves any mitigation strategies used to avoid the exposure to the risks. Examples are eliminating
particularly hazardous activities or services, avoiding certain areas due to environmental threats, or changing a tour
destination due to political unrest.
Loss reduction is slightly different; it assumes that you have acknowledged the risk of a particular activity or service,
and choose to continue to offer it, but will take steps to mitigate the severity of damage that may occur (CCTT, 2003a).
Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability | 259

An example is requiring all participants in a ski lesson to wear helmets; the risk of falling still exists, but you have taken
action to reduce the severity of any fall.

Risk Treatment
Failing the ability to control all risks identified, the next step in the process is risk treatment. This includes the
concept of risk transfer and risk retention. Risk transfer refers to the transfer of responsibility to another party, either
contractually or by insurance. Risk can be transferred through contract either by entering into a contract for service,
or by requiring participants to sign a waiver. Risk is transferred through insurance by paying premiums to an insurer,
wherein they absorb the financial risk of an accident. Risk retention refers to the level of risk that is retained by the
company through a conscious decision-making process. Examples of this may include the decision to increase the size
of insurance deductible to use, the use of self insurance, or consciously not transferring risks due to an inability to do
so (CTC, 2003b).

Spotlight On: Canadian Legal Information Institute
It’s helpful to familiarize yourself with past legal rulings to understand the current context for tourism
and hospitality risk management and the law. Managed by the Federation of Law Societies of Canada, the
Canadian Legal Information Institution (CanLII) is a non-profit organization with the goal of making Canadian
law accessible online for free. Its website provides access to court judgments, tribunal decisions, statutes,
and regulations from all Canadian jurisdictions. For more information, visit the Canadian Legal Information
Institute website www.canlii.org

Tort Law and Negligence

Figure 11.5 The plaza at BC’s provincial law courts

260 | Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability

Tort law in Canada refers to the “body of the law which will allow an injured person to obtain compensation from
the person who caused the injury” (Tort Law, n.d., ¶ 1). Two categories of torts exist: intentional and
unintentional. Intentional

torts

consist

of

assault,

battery,

trespass,

false

imprisonment,

nuisance,

and

defamation. Unintentional torts primarily consist of negligence (Tort Law, n.d.). In tourism, most lawsuits involve
negligence, with one party seeking financial compensation.

Take a Closer Look: Crocker v. Sundance Resorts
The ruling in Crocker v. Sundance Resorts provides an interesting examination of the elements of a negligent
action. The case describes an incident where a ski/snowboard resort hosted a tubing competition and
allowed an intoxicated customer to participate. An accident occurred, and the customer was paralyzed as a
result. The resort was found to be negligent as it failed to maintain an appropriate standard of care. Damages
were awarded to plaintiff (the person suing) but were reduced for “contributory negligence on behalf of the
plaintiff,” which means the injured person was also held partly responsible. The ruling can be found here:
Crocker v. Sundance Resorts: www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1988/1988canlii45/1988canlii45.html

Tourism operators must consider their exposure to unintentional torts, specifically negligence. Negligence can be
defined as “the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily
regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something a prudent and reasonable man would not do”
(Cloutier, 2000, p. 13). In other words, if the safety standards of a business fall below an established standard and injury
occurs as a result, the injured person may sue for negligence.
Pursuing legal action against an operation for negligence is a long process that needs to be initiated by the person who
has been injured. To be successful, four elements have to be proved: injury, duty to care, breach in the standard of care,
and causation.
The first of these, injury, means that it must be shown that the person suing did, in fact, receive an injury that resulted in
damages. This might be physical damage, such as a bodily injury, or it may be damage to property.
The concept of duty to care refers to the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, a relationship requiring
the defending party to care for the plaintiff. For example, in tourism, there exist relationships between hotels and
guests, tour guides and tour participants, and instructors and students. The question to ask is whether it is expected
that one person or organization in the relationship is responsible for ensuring the other person is safe from reasonable
harm. Is a tour guide responsible for the safety of the participant? If an operator answers yes, chances are that a duty to
care exists.

Take a Closer Look: The Steveston Hotel Case
The Steveston Hotel Case, made famous in 1999, still serves as a warning to establishments serving liquor. A
hotel was held liable for 50% of the damages that occurred when it permitted a patron to drive home drunk.
The case demonstrated that the hotel had a duty of care to stop serving an already intoxicated person, and to
prevent the intoxicated party from driving. You can read more details of the case by visiting Steveston Hotel

Once a duty has been established, the next step is proving negligence is to show that there was a breach in the standard
of care. This means that the defendant failed to work to the recognized standard. The standard may be established by
professional organizations or simply by the “reasonable person test,” which is an assessment of what other individuals
or operations would have done in the same situation. Tourism operators are responsible for determining what current
standards in industry are; not being aware of industry standards is not be an acceptable defence in the courts.
The last element that needs to be proved is causation. This means that there must be a strong link between the actions
of the defendant that caused injury to the plaintiff. For example, if a ski resort failed to clear the ice off its pathways,
and someone fell and was injured on the icy path, it is likely that causation could be proved (Heshka & Jackson, 2011).

Take a Closer Look: Bindseil v. McDonald’s Restaurants
The ruling in Bindseil v. McDonald’s illustrates the importance of causation. While Mr Bindseil developed
colitis (a serious stomach condition) in the time following a meal at a McDonald’s restaurant, he was unable
to prove that the meal had caused the colitis because the testimony of his medical experts was countered
with experts testifying for McDonald’s. The ruling can be found here: Bindseil v. McDonald’s Restaurants:

Contract Law

Figure 11.6 Signing a contract

262 | Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability

Contracts are frequently used by tourism operators. Common types of contracts include contracts for service,
employment agreements, rental agreements, and legal releases (waivers) (Cloutier, 2000). Given the importance of all of
these types of agreements, it is vital that operators use documents that are valid and clearly based in contract law. For
a contract to be valid and legally enforceable, it must contain all of the following components: an offer and acceptance,
consideration, an intent to enter into a legal relationship, and sufficient capacity (understanding) of those involved
involved (Longchamps & Wright, 2007). Each of these is described below.
Offer and acceptance means that the “offer” (e.g., a rental car agency will advertise a car for rent) must be clear,
unequivocal, and include all of the important and relevant terms in the contract. The acceptance also must be clearly
expressed (e.g., the renter agrees to rent the car according to the terms and conditions offered by signing the contract).
Once the offer is accepted, it becomes a promise with both parties being bound by the terms of the contract.
Consideration refers to the value that is exchanged between parties in the contract, such as money or services (e.g., the
renter pays for use of the rental car). Sometimes consideration is waiving your legal rights for a right to participate in an
activity.
An intent to enter into a legal relationship means that the individuals signing are doing so deliberately and understand
that if they do not do what they have agreed to do they will be in a breach of their contract.
Capacity refers to the ability of individuals to enter the contract. If a person signing a contract does not have sufficient
capacity, the contract will not be binding. The most common reason for not having sufficient capacity is age. In most
cases, a person who has not reached the legal age of majority cannot contract with someone else. Other requirements
for capacity include having sufficient mental capacity, and being the authorized signatory (the person with the authority
to sign on behalf of an organization) (Longchamps & Wright, 2007).
The implications of contract law to the tourism and hospitality industry are extensive; any contact signed needs to have
unambiguous terms, be clearly accepted, have an exchange of value, and be signed by an adult with full mental capacity
or by an authorized signatory of the organization. Failing to adhere to any of these conditions will likely result in the
contract being considered void.

Waivers
For many tourism operators, waivers are considered a key part of their risk management process. Waivers are
particularly important in the adventure, outdoor, and sport tourism sectors where there is a greater risk of personal
injury, and they are an effective risk management tool.

Take a Closer Look: Sample Waiver
Waivers are frequently made available by businesses online. To view a sample of a waiver for a snowcat
operator, visit Sample Waiver: http://valhallapow.com/about/waiver-form

A waiver is a form of contract that transfers acceptance of the risk to the participants by requiring them to acknowledge
the risks present in the activity. It also requires participants to waive their right to take legal action if an accident occurs.
Despite their effectiveness, there have been cases where waivers have failed to protect an organization, often because
the waiver was poorly written or delivered incorrectly (Importance of Waivers in Recreation Programs, n.d.).
Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability | 263

To be effective, a waiver should include four components. First, it should clearly outline the risks in the activity —
voluntary acceptance of risk. Second, it should waive the participant’s right to pursue legal action against the tourism
operation in case of negligence — waiver of rights. Third, it should be relatively short and easy to read, be easily
recognized as a legal document, and include a place for signature that can be witnessed by a company employee. Fourth,
it should be signed by participants only when they have been given ample time to read and understand it well in advance
of the event or activity. Failure to provide enough time may be interpreted by the courts as signing under duress, which
would make the contract void and mean that the waiver could not be used as a defence against negligence (Importance
of Liability Waivers in Recreation Programs, n.d.; Karroll v. Silverstar Resorts, 1988).

Take a Closer Look: Loychuk v. Cougar Mountain Adventures Ltd.
This case illustrates the effectiveness of a waiver program for a tourism operation. It involves two
participants in a zip-line tour in Whistler, BC. A mistake made by an employee of Cougar Mountain
Adventures resulted in the participants colliding on the zip-line at high speed. Negligence was admitted, but
because of the effectiveness of the waiver in both the way it was drafted and delivered, the courts dismissed
the claim. The ruling can be found here: Loychuk v. Cougar Mountain Adventures Ltd.: www.canlii.org/en/
bc/bcsc/doc/2011/2011bcsc193/2011bcsc193.html

Statutory Requirements for Tourism and Hospitality in BC
All tourism companies must adhere to the laws in the jurisdiction in which they operate. In BC there are certain statutes
(laws) that are particularly relevant to tourism and hospitality. These are outlined in brief below.

Hotel Keepers Act
The Hotel Keepers Act allows an accommodation provider to place a lien on guest property for unpaid bills, limits the
liability of the hotel keeper when guest property is stolen and/or damaged, and gives the provider the authority to
require guests to leave in the event of a disturbance (Hotel Keepers Act, 1996).

Take a Closer Look: Hotel Keepers Act
The Hotel Keepers Act is posted online as a resource for managers and staff at BC accommodation properties.

complete/statreg/96206_01

264 | Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability

Hotel Guest Registration Act
The Hotel Guest Registration Act requires hotel keepers to register guests appropriately, which includes noting a
guest’s arrival and departure dates, home address, and type and licence number of any vehicle (Hotel Guest Registration
Act, 1996).

Liquor Control and Licensing Act
The sales and service of alcohol in BC hospitality establishments is highly regulated by the provincial government
through the Liquor Control and Licensing Branch (LCLB).

Spotlight On: BC Liquor Control and Licensing Branch
The Liquor Control and Licensing Branch (LCLB) is responsible for regulation of liquor service, private and
public liquor stores, the importing and manufacture of alcoholic products, and distribution of those products.
For more information, visit the Liquor Control and Licensing Branch: www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/lclb/index.htm

Hospitality operators and their staff must be aware of fundamental requirements of the Liquor Control and Licensing
Act, which defines the ways in which alcohol can be made, imported, purchased, and consumed in BC. These include
(British Columbia Ministry of Justice, 2015):
• The legal drinking age in BC (19 years of age)
• Identification requirements (one piece of government-issued I.D. and a supplementary I.D. with photo or
signature)
• Restrictions on minors: entering pubs and bars (not permitted; exceptions in certain circumstances)
• Serving alcohol in a restaurant (permitted as of age 16 provided they do not mix drinks or open bottles)
• Consumption of alcohol in public places such as parks and beaches (not permitted unless specified as part of an
event or festival)
• Bringing a bottle of wine to a restaurant (permitted, with restrictions)
As these requirements change frequently, it is the responsibility of operators and staff to keep up-to-date on the
particulars of liquor legislation.

Travel Industry Regulation
As part of the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, the Travel Industry Regulation outlines the
requirements for licensing, financial reporting, and the provision of financial security for travel sales. Additionally, it
requires licensed travel agents to contribute to the Travel Assurance Fund, which compensates consumers if a travel
provider is unable to provide the purchased product due to insolvency (Travel Industry Regulation, 2009).

Occupiers Liability Act
The Occupiers Liability Act specifies the responsibilities of those that occupy a premise such as a house, building,
resort, or property to others on their property. It includes a definition of a premise, as well as the duty of care the
occupier has to care for the condition of the premises, activities on the premises, and the conduct of other people (third
parties) on the premises. It also outlines when occupiers liability is excluded, such as on Crown land or private roads
(Occupiers Liability Act, 1996).

Take a Closer Look: Cempel v. Harrison Hot Springs Hotel
The legal ruling in this case highlights the responsibility of a hospitality organization under the Occupiers
Liability Act to keep premises in safe condition even for trespassers. Ms. Cempel had trespassed onto hotel
property, fell into a particularly dangerous hotspring, and suffered severe burns as result. The hotel was

Resort Associations Act
The Resort Associations Act was developed to provide opportunities to fund a variety of promotional services for a
resort community. It outlines the organizational structure for the community and allows funding through member fees
for activities such as marketing, planning special events, developing signage, and acting as a central booking agency
(Resort Associations Act, 1996). To meet the criteria for this Act, resort areas are required to be within a designated
resort region, have alpine ski lift operations, and provide year-round recreational facilities or commercial overnight
accommodation (Government of BC, 2015).

All BC statutes are available online at the BC Laws website, operated by the Government of British Columbia.

Insurance
Obtaining and maintaining appropriate insurance coverage is an important part of the risk management process.
Insurance transfers the financial risks to a third party — the insurance company. Operators pay premiums that are
established by the insurer based on the risk of the coverage. If the likelihood of claims is high, the premiums will be
higher. There are a variety of reasons why a tourism company requires insurance: to control the risk of offered activities,
to meet statutory requirements, because industry partners require it, to protect business and assets, and to protect
employees (CTC, 2003b, p. 3).
Common types of insurance policies required by tourism operators include commercial general liability (CGL), property
insurance, and accounts receivable insurance. CGL insurance can be one of the most important coverages, but
unfortunately it can also be one of the most difficult and expensive to obtain. CGL policies cover operators for liability
if an accident occurs, including bodily injury, medical payments, and personal injury. Property insurance provides
coverage for the financial risks associated with loss of assets such as buildings, equipment, and merchandise. Accounts
receivable insurance can cover a large proportion of account receivables if a customer fails to pay due to default or
insolvency, thus providing a considerable safeguard to any tourism operation (CTC, 2003a; CTC, 2003b; Destination BC,
2013).
Insurance does not prevent accidents from happening, nor does it make an operation safer. It does, however, provide a
reasonable amount of financial protection if an accident does happen.
Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability | 267

Some insurance coverage is optional, and operators may decide to self-insure on assets such as property and accounts
receivable. Self insuring is the practice of an operation retaining the risk rather than transferring through insurance; it
may be a conscious choice or a necessity based on lack of available coverage.
Other insurance coverage may be needed, such as motor vehicle insurance or liability insurance (required by most
industry partners and some statutory requirements). In the end, the tourism operator must determine what coverage is
required and what optional additional coverage is desired.

Spotlight On: go2HR Health and Safety Information
As part of its mandate to support human resources best practice in BC’s tourism and hospitality industry,
go2HR works in the field of occupational health and safety. In partnership with WorkSafeBC, it offers the
Certificate of Recognition (COR) in safety. For more information, visit go2HR Health and Safety Information:
www.go2hr.ca/health-safety

Occupational Health and Safety in Tourism
So far we have primarily discussed risk management from a client/guest perspective. However, substantial effort in a
tourism and hospitality operation must be put into managing worker safety as well. Responsibilities for worker safety
are generally legislated by occupational health and safety laws, which clearly dictate safety standards. Employers who
fail to adhere to these standards may be penalized or fined (WorkSafeBC, 2015a).
WorkSafeBC is the provincial organization for occupational health and safety in BC. It is an independent agency
managed by a board of directors who are appointed by government. The mandate of WorkSafeBC is to (2015b, ¶ 3.):
• Promote the prevention of workplace injury, illness, and disease
• Rehabilitate those who are injured and provide timely return to work
• Provide fair compensation to replace workers’ loss of wages while recovering from injuries
• Ensure sound financial management for a viable workers’ compensation system
There was an average of 6,505 tourism and hospitality WorkSafeBC claims each year from 1998 to 2007, with
approximately $32,100,000 paid out annually (WorkSafeBC, 2015c). This included payments for physical rehabilitation as
well as short- and long-term disability disbursements. To reduce these claims and protect workers, WorkSafeBC has an
extensive worker safety program with educational resources and training programs available. A partnership with go2HR
— the tourism and hospitality human resources organization — has been developed to raise awareness in tourism and
hospitality about worker safety, particularly for young, vulnerable workers (go2HR, 2015).

268 | Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability

Figure 11.8 Kitchen accidents are a common workplace injury
in hospitality. Many are more serious than this.

The nature of tourism and hospitality often means operations need to employ a considerable number of employees;
these are often entry-level positions, requiring little experience. Employers need to be cognizant of the requirements
for worker safety under WorkSafeBC; failing to do so may result in fines for the operation, or far worse — workplace
injuries to employees.

Spotlight On: WorkSafeBC BC Tourism and Hospitality Resources
WorkSafeBC has extensive resources for tourism and hospitality workers to avoid workplace injury. These
include prevention tools for accommodation, adventure tourism, food and beverage, and events. WorkSafeBC
also explains updates and changes to workers’ compensation in BC, and provides opportunities for courses
and training in first aid and injury prevention. For more information, visit WorkSafeBC BC Tourism and
Hospitality Resources: www2.worksafebc.com/Portals/Tourism/Home.asp

In addition to concerns about safety, employers and employees must be aware of the Employment Standards Act.
This act defines the legal requirements around employment such as minimum wage, breaks, meal times, vacation pay,
statutory holidays, age of employment, and leave from work (British Columbia Ministry of Labour, 2015)

Conclusion
Risk management in tourism and hospitality is complex, involving aspects of adhering to statutory requirements, taking
steps to ensure occupational health and safety requirements are met, and undertaking an analytical approach to
mitigating potential liabilities. Most of the actions required need to be proactive by the operators; failing to do so may
result in negative impacts to reputation, damage to property, fines, lawsuits, or in the most tragic result — injury to
guests or employees. Companies not only have a moral and ethical responsibility to practise effective risk management,
failing to do so can result in financial ruin and the cessation of operations.
This chapter reviewed an important consideration for tourism and hospitality professionals. Chapter 12 addresses
another key component of the industry in BC, Aboriginal tourism.

Case Study: Tort Law

In January 2015, a Kamloops woman sued Sun Peaks Resort Corporation after breaking her leg on the
resort’s tubing terrain. The incident took place in 2013.
In court documents, Pamela Boileau said she visited the resort with her husband and two young children to use
the tube park, where, she claimed, no signs were posted restricting the age of children allowed to use the facility.
She then took a ride with her husband and their baby.
According to her filing, “the ride was very fast and bumpy and the tubes went high on the berm and then hit
a big bump and the plaintiff’s infant daughter went flying out of her tube” (Petriuk, 2015). In order to help her
daughter, Boileau stopped the tube she was riding in abruptly and broke her leg in multiple places.
According to Boileau, the next day the resort erected signage prohibiting children under four years of age from
using the tubing park. She sued for general damages, special damages and interest, and money for past and
future health care. The lawsuit named Sun Peaks Resort Corporation and four employees in the claim.
Based on this description of the claim, as circulated in the media, answer the following questions to the best of
your ability:
1. What evidence is there that staff at the resort had engaged in the four stages of risk identification? For
each stage, note what the resort could have done differently.
2. What were the real, perceived, and inherent risks of using the tube park? How would these be different
for an adult participating in tubing and a small child?
3. In your opinion, has the plaintiff established the following? Why or why not?
1. Injury

272 | Chapter 11. Risk Management and Legal Liability

2. Duty to care
3. Breach in the standard of care
4. Causation
4. Would a waiver have made a difference? Explain why or why not.
5. Search the internet to find the details of this case and any updates on what happened with the parties
involved. How did the outcome differ from what you expected?
6. What is your personal feeling about who is responsible for the injury in this case? How does that differ
from what the law has to say?

Overview
In previous chapters, you’ve learned that Aboriginal tourism is an increasingly central part of BC’s tourism economy.
In Canada, tourism operations that are majority owned and operated by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people comprise
this segment of the industry. This chapter explores the global context for Aboriginal tourism development, the history
of the sector in BC, and important facts about Aboriginal tourism in BC today.

276 | Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism

Today’s travellers are attracted to many global destinations because of the opportunity to interact with, and learn from,
other cultures. Visitors to Australia can meet an Aboriginal guide who will help them feel a spiritual connection through
a memorable outback experience. In New Zealand (Aotearoa in the Maori language), tourists are often welcomed into
a ceremonial community marae, a communal or sacred centre that serves a religious and social purpose in Polynesian
societies (New Zealand Maori Tourism Society, 2012).
In the mountainous region of northern Vietnam, traditionally dressed ethnic minority villagers are now opening their
homes to international trekkers, thus generating new income for the community. In the United States, visitors to the
ancient desert wonders of Monument Valley can enhance their experience in a Navaho-run hotel, enjoying indigenous
cuisine while learning about the cultures of the Native American groups that have lived there for centuries.
Globally, indigenous peoples are those groups protected under international or national legislation as having specific
rights based on their historical ties to a particular territory and their cultural or historical distinctiveness from other
populations (Coates, 2004). Indigenous people in Canada are often called First peoples or Aboriginal peoples and have
diverse languages, ceremonies, traditions, and histories. The Canadian Constitution Act recognizes three groups of
Aboriginal people: First Nations, Inuit, and Métis.
Before learning more about Canadian First peoples and their social and cultural connections to tourism, let’s
acknowledge the often negative impacts of recent history on indigenous peoples around the globe. Current attempts to
influence positive change in this area will then be highlighted.

Tourism and Indigenous Human Rights
The history of tourism has seen considerable exploitation of indigenous peoples. Land has been expropriated, economic
activity suppressed by outside interests, and cultural expressions (such as arts and crafts) have been appropriated by
Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism | 277

outside groups. Appropriation refers to the act of taking something for one’s own use, typically without the owner’s
permission.
In recognition of these wider concerns, in 2007, the United Nations created the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
People. This marked a significant achievement in obtaining international recognition of key rights, including, but not
limited to, self-determination, land use, and natural resources rights. It set forth the minimum standards for the survival,
dignity, and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world (United Nations, 2007).

Spotlight On: International Institute for Peace through Tourism
Started in Vancouver in 1988, the International Institute for Peace through Tourism (IIPT) is now based in
Africa and promotes the value of travel and cross-cultural exchange as a key potential contributor to global
peace. It promotes tourism for its role in intercultural dialogue and exchanges, and supports indigenous
communities’ right to self-determination. For more information, visit the International Institute for Peace
through Tourism website: www.iipt.org

Themes related to indigenous tourism were raised at this time, but it was not until 2012 that the Pacific Asia Travel
Association organized a gathering of global indigenous tourism professionals to establish guiding principles for the
development of indigenous tourism. These principles are now known as the Larrakia Declaration on the Development
of Indigenous Tourism, named after the Larrakia Nation, the Australian Aboriginal host community for the meeting
(PATA & WINTA, 2014).

Spotlight On: World Indigenous Tourism Alliance
World Indigenous Tourism Alliance (WINTA) was formed in Australia in 2012 during the same gathering that
created the Larrakia Declaration. A global network, it is made up of over 170 indigenous and non-indigenous
organizations in 40 countries, such as tourism associations, businesses, service providers, and government
groups. For more information, visit the World Indigenous Tourism Alliance websitewww.winta.org

The Larrakia Declaration

Figure 12.2 This “We Don’t Climb” sign expresses the traditional laws of Australian Aboriginal people
and asks that tourists not climb Uluru (once known as Ayers Rock). In the background, dozens of people
continue to climb.

According to the Larrakia Declaration, these are the key principles that should guide all culturally respectful indigenous
tourism business development (World Indigenous Tourism Alliance, 2012, pp. 1-2):
“It is hereby resolved to adopt the following principles; that …
• Respect for customary law and lore, land and water, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions,
cultural heritage that will underpin all tourism decisions.
• Indigenous culture, the land and waters on which it is based, will be protected and promoted through well
managed tourism practices and appropriate interpretation.
• Indigenous peoples will determine the extent, nature and organisational arrangements for their participation in
tourism and that governments and multilateral agencies will support the empowerment of Indigenous people.
• That governments have a duty to consult and accommodate Indigenous peoples before undertaking decisions on
public policy and programs designed to foster the development of Indigenous tourism.
• The tourism industry will respect Indigenous intellectual property rights, cultures and traditional practices, the
need for sustainable and equitable business partnerships and the proper care of the environment and communities
that support them.
• That equitable partnerships between the tourism industry and Indigenous people will include the sharing of
cultural awareness and skills development which support the well-being of communities and enable enhancement
of individual livelihoods.”

Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism | 279

Using these guiding principles, it becomes clear that Aboriginal tourism development can be considered successful only
if the rights of indigenous people are upheld.

Take a Closer Look: UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People
In 2007, the United Nations passed a declaration to address human rights violations against indigenous
people. The document, sometimes known as UNDRIP, contains 46 articles, one of which is “Every indigenous
individual has the right to a nationality” (United Nations, 2007, p. 5). For more information, read the UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People [PDF]: www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/
DRIPS_en.pdf

Before turning our attention to Canadian and BC Aboriginal tourism examples, let’s briefly consider the context in which
these activities in tourism are occurring, and review more important definitions. We can do this by taking a closer look
at Canada’s First peoples.

First Peoples in Canada
First Peoples: A Guide for Newcomers (Wilson & Henderson, 2014) is an excellent resource for tourism professionals who
want to know more about the complex socio-political issues surrounding Aboriginal people in Canadian history and
society today. This section contains highlights from this guide.
In 2011, approximately 1.4 million people in Canada identified themselves as Aboriginal — roughly 4.3% of the total
population.
First Nations people are Aboriginal peoples who do not identify as Inuit or Métis. They have lived across present-day
Canada for thousands of years and have numerous languages, cultures, and spiritual beliefs. For centuries, they managed
their lands and resources with their own governments, laws, and traditions, but with the formation of the country of
Canada, their way of life was changed forever. The government forced a system of band governance on First Nations so
that they could no longer use their system of government. There are now 203 bands in BC, and 614 across the country
(Wilson & Henderson, 2014).

280 | Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism

Figure 12.3 First Nations performer at the opening of the
Aboriginal Pavilion for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic
Games

Colonial settlement has left a legacy of land displacement, economic deprivation, and negative health consequences
that Canada’s First Nations are still striving to overcome (Wilson & Henderson, 2014). However, First Nations people are
working hard to reclaim their traditions, and in many places there is an increasing pride in a revitalized culture.
Indian (or Native Indian) is still an important legal term in Canada, but many Aboriginal people associate it with
government regulation and colonialism and its use has gone out of favour, unlike in the United States where American
Indian is still common (Wilson & Henderson, 2014).
Inuit have lived in the Arctic region of Canada for countless years. Many Inuit still rely on the resources of the land, ice,
and sea to maintain traditional connections to the land. The old ways of life were seriously compromised, however, when
Inuit began to participate with European settlers in the fur trade. The Government of Canada accelerated this change
by requiring many Inuit communities to move away from their traditional hunting and gathering ways of life on the land
and into permanent, centralized settlements (Wilson & Henderson, 2014).

Spotlight On: Inuit Tapiriitt Kanatami
Inuit Tapiriitt Kanatami (ITK) is the national Inuit organization in Canada. It represents four regions:
Nunatsiavut (Labrador), Nunavik (northern Quebec), Nunavut, and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the
Northwest Territories. It is an advocacy organization that represents the interests of Inuit in environmental,
social, political, and economic affairs, including economic and tourism development. For more information,
visit the Inuit Tapiriitt Kanatami website: www.itk.ca

Today, in spite of social and economic hardships created by this change, many Inuit communities focus on protecting
their traditional way of life and language. Recently the inukshuk, an Inuit symbol used as a welcoming signpost for
hunters, was used as a key emblem for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Note that non-Inuit people used to call Inuit people Eskimo, but this is now considered insulting and should be avoided
(Wilson & Henderson, 2014).

Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism | 281

Métis comes from the words to mix. In the 1600s and 1700s, many French and Scottish men migrated to Canada for the
fur trade. Some of them had children with First Nations women and formed new communities, and their people became
the first to be called Métis. Today, the infinity symbol on the Métis flag symbolizes the joining of two cultures that will
live forever.

Spotlight On: Louis Riel Institute
The Louis Riel Institute in Winnipeg is dedicated to the preservation and celebration of Métis culture and
supporting Métis in achieving their educational, career, and life goals. Its website features photographs
and descriptions of Métis art and handicrafts as well as information about community programs. For more
information, visit the Louis Riel Institute website: www.louisrielinstitute.com

The distinct Métis culture is known for its fine beadwork, fiddling, and jigging. Canadian and international tourists can
learn from and enjoy participating in a large number of Métis festivals in most provinces across the country.

Take a Closer Look: Métis Nation Gateway
This portal site features information about the Métis Nation, including healing, economic development,
environment, electoral reform, veterans’ issues, and more. The portal on economic development leads
to information on community development, including tourism policy and plans [PDF]. To explore these
resources, visit Métis Nation Gateway: http://metisportals.ca/wp/

There is an increasing appreciation that intercultural exchanges can help strengthen cultures at risk, if managed
thoughtfully. For example, the growing niche of Arctic cruise tourism has brought both opportunities and challenges
to the isolated small communities of Canada’s rugged Arctic coast. In recognition, the World Wildlife Fund produced a
Code of Conduct for Arctic tourists. In part it reads:
Respect Local Cultures:
• Learn about the culture and customs of the areas you will visit before you go.
• Respect the rights of Arctic residents. You are most likely to be accepted and welcomed if you travel with an
open mind, learn about local culture and traditions, and respect local customs and etiquette.
• If you are not travelling with a tour, let the community you will visit know that you are coming.
• Supplies are sometimes scarce in the Arctic, so be prepared to bring your own.
• Ask permission before you photograph people or enter their property or living spaces.”
(WWF International Arctic Programme, n.d., p. 2)
Tourism can promote community and economic development while preserving indigenous culture. With that in mind,
let’s have a look at the evolution of Aboriginal tourism in Canada, and at some strategies to advance this segment of the
industry.

282 | Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism

Aboriginal Tourism in Canada
Evolution of Aboriginal Tourism in Canada
While there has always been some demand among visitors to Canada to learn more about Aboriginal heritage, driven
by the strong interest of Europeans in particular, until recently there has been no concerted effort to focus on defining
and strengthening Aboriginal cultural tourism. However, over the last 20 years or so, steps have been taken to support
authentic Aboriginal cultural products and experiences and to counter decades of appropriation of Aboriginal symbols
and arts and crafts by non-Aboriginal Canadians.
Aboriginal exhibits and displays were developed for tourism attractions and museums by well-meaning non-Aboriginals
who did not consult with local communities. Souvenir shops were often filled with inexpensive overseas-made replicas
of authentic Aboriginal arts and crafts, and some still are. To this day, we see the Canadian Prairie Aboriginal headdress
being used as a way of (mis)representing First Nations across Canada.

Figure 12.4 Cultural products for sale as souvenirs

As the number of Aboriginal tourism businesses started to increase in the 1980s and 1990s, the federal government
initiated discussions on Aboriginal tourism. The outcome was the formation of national organizations that provided
a coordinated industry voice for operators: Aboriginal Tourism Team Canada (ATTC), Aboriginal Tourism Canada, and
Aboriginal Tourism Marketing Circle (ATMC), and others. These groups started the trend of defining Aboriginal cultural
tourism standards and promoting the establishment of regional, provincial, and territorial organizations to develop and
market more successful businesses. Today, these functions are performed by the Aboriginal Tourism Association of
Canada (ATAC).

Spotlight On: Aboriginal Tourism Association of Canada
Aboriginal Tourism Association of Canada (ATAC) is a consortium of over 20 Aboriginal tourism industry

organizations and government representatives from across Canada. It was formed to create a unified voice
and was formalized in 2014 (building from the ATMC established in 2009). ATAC continues to evolve to
support marketing, product development and training standards, and other initiatives. For more information,
visit the Aboriginal Tourism Association of Canada: www.aboriginalcanada.ca

Aboriginal Tourism in Canada Today
Despite challenges such as appropriation, thanks to these organizations, tourism is becoming a major economic and
cultural driver for Aboriginal communities across Canada. It is estimated that in 2014 “Aboriginal tourism provided over
37,000 jobs in Canada and generated almost $3 billion in gross output into the Canadian economy … up substantially
since 2002 where jobs were estimated at 13,000 and gross output was estimated at $2.3 billion” (O’Neil et al., 2014, p.
i-xii).
To define this segment of the industry, the Aboriginal Tourism Association of Canada (2013, p. 4) uses these terms:
Aboriginal tourism: describes all tourism businesses that are majority-owned and operated by First Nations,
Métis and Inuit. They must also demonstrate a connection and responsibility to the local Aboriginal community
and traditional territory where the operation resides.
Aboriginal cultural tourism: meets the Aboriginal tourism criteria and in addition, a significant portion of the
experience incorporates Aboriginal culture in a manner that is appropriate, respectful and true to the Aboriginal
culture being portrayed. The authenticity is ensured through the active involvement of Aboriginal people in the
development and delivery of the experience.
Aboriginal cultural experiences: offer the visitor a cultural experience in a manner that is appropriate,
respectful and true to the Aboriginal culture being portrayed.

Strengthening Aboriginal Tourism in Canada

Figure 12.5 Cover of Aboriginal Cultural Tourism Business
Planning Guide

Tourism is of significant interest to growing numbers of Aboriginal communities in Canada. If developed in a thoughtful
and sensitive manner, it can have potential positive economic, cultural, and social impacts. Many communities have
undertaken tourism development activities to support cultural revival, intercultural awareness, and economic growth.
This growth brings jobs and career opportunities for Aboriginal people at all skill levels.
In the Aboriginal Cultural Tourism Business Planning Guide, the following are suggested as the foundational building
blocks necessary to run a successful and authentic Aboriginal tourism business:
• Understand the industry, learn about cultural tourists, and develop products carefully
• Ensure experiences are culturally authentic
• Involve the community’s “culture keepers” and Elders
• Practice environmental sustainability
• Prepare an Aboriginal cultural tourism business plan
• Meet visitor expectations through staff training and excellent hospitality, provided from a cultural perspective
• Ensure an effective web and social media presence
• Build personal support networks
The guide also highlights the importance of place to the Aboriginal tourism experience. It suggests that guests leave
an authentic tourism experience with a memorable collection of feelings, memories, and images that all contribute to a
unique sense of place and help guests understand the culture being shared (Kanahele, 1991). In order to highlight this

Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism | 285

sense of place, operators are encouraged to reflect on and impart aspects of their culture with the following elements
of their business (Aboriginal Tourism BC & CTHRC, 2013):
• Decor such as signage, displays, art, photography
• Company name
• Branding elements such as logo and website design
• Employee uniforms or dress code
• Food and beverage
• Traditional stories shared with guests
• Key words and expressions from the Aboriginal host language shared in guest interactions
These touch points create a richer, and more authentic, experience for the visitor.
As an Elder once stated, Aboriginal tourism businesses showcase “culture, heritage and traditions,” and “because these
belong to the entire community, the community should have some input” (Aboriginal Tourism BC & CTHRC, 2013, p. 19).
For this reason, the guide suggests operators consider the extent to which:
• Community members understand the project or business as it is being proposed
• Keepers of the culture are engaged in the development of the idea
• The business or experience reflects community values

on the Trails of 1885 project. This and other initiatives have been successful across the country, including some in British
Columbia, which has begun to emerge as a premier destination for Aboriginal experiences.

Aboriginal Tourism in BC
The Aboriginal Tourism Association of BC (AtBC) was founded in 1996, spurred by a research project that detailed
the changing motivations of visitors to BC. It identified that specific target markets were particularly motivated to
visit BC to experience local or regional Aboriginal culture. Using this information, AtBC created a work plan,
established funding partnerships with governments, developed a membership model, and initiated a range of strategies
and tactics outlined in two five-year plans.

Spotlight On: Aboriginal Tourism BC
BC’s tourism industry is fortunate to have an active organization like Aboriginal Tourism BC (AtBC) which,
while young, has gained an international reputation for effectiveness. Its role is to encourage the professional
development of Aboriginal cultural experiences in the province and to then market those businesses to the
world. For more information, visit Aboriginal Tourism BC: www.aboriginalbc.com/corporate/

Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism | 287

Since its inception, AtBC has grown to represent over 150 diverse stakeholder businesses, including campgrounds, art
galleries and gift shops, hotels, eco-lodges and resorts, Aboriginal restaurants and catering services, cultural heritage
sites and interpretive centres, kayak and canoe tours, adventure tourism operations, and guided hikes through heritage
sites (Aboriginal Tourism BC, 2012). It has also proven adept at online promotion and social media. As well, it has become
world renowned for its strategic approach to Aboriginal tourism development, which we examine in the next section.

A Strategic Approach to Growth
In 2012, AtBC released its five-year strategic plan, which identified targets for Aboriginal cultural tourism industry
success. Its goals by 2017 included (Aboriginal Tourism BC, 2012):
• Increased provincial revenue of $68 million (10% growth per year)
• Employment at 4,000 full-time equivalent positions (10% growth per year)
• 100 market-ready Aboriginal cultural tourism businesses (10% growth per year in all six BC tourism regions)
To achieve these targets, the plan identified key strategies, reviewed and adjusted annually, such as (Aboriginal Tourism
BC, 2013):
• Push for market readiness
• Build and strengthen partnerships
• Focus on online marketing
• Focus on key and emerging markets
• Focus on authenticity and quality assurance
• Take a regional approach
Following good overall tourism planning principles, AtBC ensured its plan aligned with Destination BC’s five-year
tourism strategy, Gaining the Edge, as well as Canada’s federal tourism strategy. As part of this alignment, recent efforts
have placed renewed emphasis on the need for market readiness.

Push for Market Readiness
As we’ve learned elsewhere in this textbook, today’s travellers are more complex than in the past and have higher
expectations. Potential guests are web-savvy and have the world at their fingertips. For this reason, it’s important that
Aboriginal operators ensure they are sufficiently ready to run as a tourism business.
There are three categories of readiness, each with a set of criteria that must be met (Aboriginal Tourism Association of
Canada, 2013):
288 | Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism

• A visitor-ready operation is often a start-up or small operation that might qualify for a listing in a tourism
directory but not be considered ready for cost-shared promotions with other businesses due to lack of amenities
or predictability.
• A market-ready business must meet visitor-ready criteria plus demonstrate a number of other strengths around
customer service, marketing materials, published pricing and payments policies, short response times and
reservations systems, and so on.
• Export-ready criteria include the previous categories, plus sophisticated travel distribution trade channels to
attract out-of-town visitors. They provide highly reliable services to all guests, particularly those travelling with
groups.
By educating cultural tourism businesses about these standards, and then creating incentives for marketing
opportunities, AtBC helps to raise the bar for BC Aboriginal cultural tourism experiences. Its goal is to push as many
operators toward market readiness (the second category) as possible so that they may eventually become export ready
alongside other BC tourism experiences.

Authenticity and Quality Assurance

Figure 12.7 The Authentic Indigenous logo, helping consumers choose
authentic arts and crafts

Another one of the five-year strategic initiatives is the program to encourage visitors to purchase authentic arts
and crafts, not unauthorized knock-offs. The Authentic Indigenous Artisan Program protects Aboriginal artists by
identifying three tiers of artwork for active promotion (Authentic Indigenous, 2015):
• Tier 1: The highest level of authenticity. If an artist, or an artist via an indigenous company, designs, produces, and
distributes an indigenous art product, it will be permitted to display a Tier 1 Authentic Indigenous stamp or tag.
This tag ensures that indigenous artists and craftspeople have been remunerated for their work, while at the same
time the integrity of their designs is being protected.
• Tier 2: Allows indigenous arts entrepreneurs to compete in a market where there has traditionally been no
indigenous involvement. If an indigenous art product is designed by an indigenous person and distributed by an
indigenous person or business, but made outside the indigenous community, it can display a Tier 2 Authentic
Indigenous stamp or tag.
• Tier 3: Allows artists to license their creations for production and sale outside of the indigenous community.

FirstHost

Figure 12.8 Cover to the FirstHost program workbook

Another key component of the Aboriginal tourism experience is the host. In BC, the FirstHost program supports the
development of Aboriginal hosts who are well trained, know what guests are looking for, and who can help provide an
authentic cultural experience. This is a one-day tourism workshop offered through the Native Education College and
delivered throughout the province and Canada.
FirstHost was inspired by Hawaiian tourism pioneer, Dr. George Kanahele (1913-2000), who saw the impact tourism
was having on indigenous culture and set out to educate the industry that “the relationship between place, host and
guest must be one of equality” (Native Education College, 2014, p. 28). Participants learn about hospitality service
290 | Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism

delivery and the special importance of the host, guest, and place relationship. The program is recognized by Aboriginal
Tourism BC, WorldHost, and is funded by the Coastal Corridor Consortium of educators from multiple postsecondary
institutions and cultural organizations (Native Education College, 2014). This well-received workshop, delivered by
Aboriginal trainers, is another reason Aboriginal tourism continues to grow stronger in the province.

Examples of BC Aboriginal Tourism Development

While AtBC members are too numerous to detail here, one BC community is often in the spotlight for its significant
tourism activity, thanks to its physical and cultural assets and positive leadership. Let’s take a closer look at this example.

Nk’Mip
The Osoyoos (Nk’Mip) Indian Band (OIB) is part of the Okanagan First Nation located in the Interior of BC. The band is
home to about 400 on-reserve members. A main goal of the OIB is to move from dependency to a sustainable economy
like that which existed before contact (Centre for First Nations Governance, 2013).

Take a Closer Look: Centre for First Nations Governance Success Stories
The Centre for First Nations Governance is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing self-governance
support to First Nations communities across Canada. It helps with planning, governance, the establishment
of laws, and nation-rebuilding efforts. Its website features success stories, in video format, that highlight
these efforts. For more information, visit the Centre for First Nations Governance Success Stories:
http://fngovernance.org/success

Okanagan First Nations once travelled widely to fish, gather, and hunt. Each year, the first harvests of roots, berries,
fish, and game were celebrated during ceremonies honouring the food chiefs who provided for the people. During the
winter, people returned to permanent winter villages. The names of many of the settlements in the Okanagan Valley —

292 | Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism

Osoyoos, Keremeos, Penticton and Kelowna — come from Aboriginal words for these settled areas and attest to the long
history of the Syilx people on this land.
Just 40 years ago, the OIB was bankrupt and living off government social assistance. In 1988, it sought to turn the
tide on this history and created the Osoyoos Indian Band Development Corporation (OIBDC). Through good leadership
and initiative, the band has been able to develop agriculture, eco-tourism, and commercial, industrial, and residential
developments on its 32,200 acre reserve lands. It does have the good fortune to be located in one of Canada’s premier
agricultural and tourism regions; however, it has also taken a determined and well-crafted effort to become an example
of indigenous economic success. The band employs hundreds of people and has annual revenues of around $26 million
(LinkBC, 2012).

Figure 12.10 Friendly staff at Nk’Mip
Desert Cultural Centre

The OIBDC now manages a number of tourism operations, and visitors to this sunny desert region can stay in the
226-room Spirit Ridge Vineyard Resort & Spa, visit the Nk’Mip Desert Cultural Centre, camp in the Nk’Mip Campground
& RV Resort (a 326-site operation open year round), and enjoy visiting Nk’Mip Cellars (the first Aboriginal-owned winery
in North America). Site preparation is also underway for a $120 million Canyon Desert Resort, a joint venture with
Bellstar Hotels and Resorts located adjacent to the 18-hole Nk’Mip Canyon Desert Golf Course. Future vineyard and
resort developments are on the drawing board (LinkBC, 2012).
The area attracts about 400,000 visitors per year, and at peak tourist season there is essentially full employment among
the more than 470 members of the Osoyoos reserve. In addition to the core businesses, many secondary businesses
have formed. For example, the award-winning Nk’Mip Desert Cultural Centre promotes conservation efforts for desert
wildlife and has also helped to create several spinoff businesses, including a landscaping business, a greenhouse for
indigenous plants, a website development business, and a community arts and crafts market (LinkBC, 2012).

Examples like Nk’Mip demonstrate that BC is on track to become one of the world’s leading destinations for Aboriginal

tourism experiences. Across Canada, First Nations and their partners are using Aboriginal-developed standards to help
preserve and strengthen cultures while building economic benefits for their communities. This is directly in line with
the global trend toward linking tourism with the need to uphold indigenous rights. When developed in partnership with
indigenous communities, Aboriginal tourism can continue to attract visitors, provide quality guest experiences, and
honour Aboriginal heritage.
Up to this point, we’ve gained an understanding of multiple sectors of the industry as well as special considerations for
professionals in BC. Chapter 13 explores careers and work experience in tourism and hospitality.

Case Study: Case Study: Tourism and the Red Dzao and Black Hmong in Vietnam

In the mountainous region of northern Vietnam, ethnic minorities including the Red Dzao and Black Hmong
once generated income through subsistence farming, timber harvesting, and opium cultivation. As tourism to
the region increased, this also became an economic opportunity, one with the potential to benefit many people.
A number of developments, including a community-based tourism project supported by Capilano University and
Hanoi Open University, and funded by the Pacific Asia Travel Association, increased tourism revenues coming

296 | Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism

into the community. The project began in the village of Ta Phin, and after some promising steps forward there,
it was replicated in Lao Chai.
Lao Chai used to be just a lunch stop for tourists trekking through the beautiful region. Over a period of many
years, training and capacity-building activities were undertaken by local indigenous people with the support of
project volunteers. The fascinating culture, the hospitality of the community, and new trekking routes created a
more complete tourism destination. Now the town is seen as a suitable place for an overnight stay.
A potential threat to the rights of the ethnic minorities and the village products has been the lack of inclusion
and participation in decision making and tourism planning. This was evident during the development of Hoang
Lien Son National Park. To protect this regional mountain range, authorities increased the borders of the
park, encroaching on traditionally important natural resources for the village. Additional challenges arose
because non-indigenous Vietnamese hold the majority of government positions and own the majority of tourism
businesses in the region.
Despite these challenges, and with the support of students and faculty from Capilano University and Hanoi Open
University, some indigenous people have set up small shops and a restaurant, which attract visitors interested
in stopping for lunch. Homestays have been certified, allowing guests to enjoy an overnight experience in the
village as part of an indigenous family. As these operations have proved successful, additional families have
worked to train and make investments in their properties.

2. Review the Larrakia Declaration mentioned earlier in this chapter. What, in your opinion, are the most
important of these principles that need to be understood in order for a project like this to succeed?
3. Who were the stakeholders brought to the table by the development project?
4. What changes were implemented? What support was offered to community members?
5. Whose responsibility is the ongoing success of the project? How might success be measured?
6. What are the lessons for Aboriginal tourism development in BC? List five strategies used or actions taken
in Viet Nam that could be applied here at home.

Case Study: Case Study: Trails of 1885 Bridges Cultures and Builds Tourism

Western Canada in the 1880s was facing a time of rapid change as the buffalo disappeared and the established
way of life was rocked to its core. Tensions rose between European settlers and the Métis, whose rights had
been eroded. In 1885, the North-West Resistance (formerly known as the North-West Rebellion) concluded with
the hanging of resistance leader Louis Riel and eight other Aboriginal leaders (Trails of 1885, 2015).
In the years since, residents of Saskatchewan have protected areas from major interpretive centres to remote
meadows and hillsides where solitary historic markers recount stories from an almost mythical past.
In 2006, a small group of tourism developers and historic site managers gathered in Saskatoon to discuss how

Chapter 12. Aboriginal Tourism | 297

these locations and their stories could be brought together and enhanced to collectively attract more visitors to
the region.
As detailed in Cultural and Heritage Tourism: A Handbook for Community Champions, their project included:
• Creating an inventory of 1885-related sites and stories
• Meeting with site stakeholders to gauge interest in the project
• Acknowledging that First Nations and Métis stories had been previously overlooked
• Creating the 1885 coalition (Elders, accommodations, tourism organizations, tourism attractions,
museums, tour operators)
• Reaching beyond Saskatchewan (the site of the main historical event) to Alberta and Manitoba sites
related to the story of the North-West Resistance
• Finding funding, striking a steering committee, and finding a project manager
• Navigating culturally sensitive issues including the language of program delivery
• Creating visuals and branding (including the Trails of 1885 brand itself)
The project relied on the participation of various stakeholder groups and the leadership of a local champion. As
a result of their efforts, an elk-hide proclamation was signed by First Nations, the Métis Nation, and federal and
provincial governments.
Numerous other major events were held throughout the year including the first-ever reenactment of the Battle
of Poundmaker Cree Nation and other 1885 ceremonies in communities across the region. The added impact of
Trails of 1885 resulted in the largest attendance of the annual Métis homecoming festival (Back to Batoche Days).
To support long-term tourism benefits to the region, these activities were reinforced by capital projects such
as highway improvements (to the sites), highway and site signage, large maps at various 1885 sites, and multimillion dollar improvements at Batoche. After this multi-year project, a new non-profit corporation, Trails of
1885 Association, was created to extend the work into the future and promote the region as a long-term tourism
draw.
According to one of the initiative’s leaders, “the project has certainly met one of its main goals—to increase
visitation and visitor satisfaction, while developing First Nations and Métis cultural awareness locally, regionally,
provincially, and nationally” (LinkBC, 2012, p. 66).
Visit the site at www.trailsof1885.com and answer the following questions:
1. List two attractions in each of the three provinces that span this project. What do they have in common?
2. List five stakeholder groups who participated in the development of Trails of 1885. How might their
interests differ? How might they align? Name three benefits of having these partners work together.
3. What kind of tours are available to visitors wanting to learn more about this time in Canada’s history?
4. Based on the website, where would you say the Trails of 1885 falls on the readiness scale (visitor ready,
market ready, export ready)? Why would you classify it in this way?
5. Go back to the Larrakia Declaration and create a checklist made up of the statements. In what ways did
this project adhere to the principles set out in the declaration? Are there any ways the project could have
done better?

Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience
MICKI MCCARTNEY AND LYNDA ROBINSON

Learning Objectives

• Identify and define the steps in career planning
• Identify aspects of labour market information
• Compare and describe types of work learning experiences
• Describe tools and strategies to successfully complete work experience
• Explore career management strategies for workplace success
• Review industry career profiles and professions for common themes

Overview
This chapter is divided into three parts. First, we’ll learn the essential steps of career planning. Then we’ll take a look
at the types of work experience you can engage in while still at school. Finally, we’ll explore how you can integrate your
planning with your education and experiences, and we’ll hear from graduates who have been successful in their career
choices.

Figure 13.1 Students from Vancouver Island University win recognition and gain
experience at the LinkBC Student Case Competition

Let’s start with a review of the essential steps in the career planning process.

Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 301

Career Planning
Shepard and Mani define career planning “as an ongoing process through which an individual sets career goals and
identifies the means to achieve them” (2013, p. 14). It is through career planning that a person evaluates abilities and
interests, assesses values and personality, considers alternative career opportunities, establishes career goals, and plans
practical developmental activities.
Career planning requires individuals to understand themselves and their values, interests, and skills. It is also an ongoing
process, one that must be repeated with changes in employment and life circumstances. As you gain more experience
and knowledge, the process will begin anew.
This section reviews the five essential steps of career planning, which are based on our research and input from industry
experts:
1. Conduct a self-assessment
2. Research the labour market
3. Create your career search toolkit
4. Put your career campaign into action
5. Engage in networking
Let’s start at step one.

Step One: Conduct a Self-Assessment
Self knowledge is the key to choosing a career. It can be overwhelming to begin the process of self-assessment. However,
if done well at the start, the likelihood of securing work that has meaning, purpose, and fulfillment is far greater.
Understanding your preferences, knowing your strengths, and honestly facing the areas you need to develop are the
first steps for effective self-assessment.

Take a Closer Look: Tourism Careers from the CTHRC
The Canadian Tourism HR Council (CTHRC) has a website that can help you explore career options. Start
with its “tourism career quiz” to see where you might find a fit, and browse the list of job boards and
other resources. Check out these Tourism Career Resources: http://www.cthrc.ca/en/resources/
tourism_careers

Rosenberg McKay (2014) identifies self-assessment as “the process of gathering information about you in order to make
a knowledgeable career decision” and adds that “a self-assessment should examine values, interests, personality, and
skills” (¶ 1). Your values should guide your decision making to ensure a good fit for both you and your employer.

302 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

Take a Closer Look: Explore Careers by Skills and Knowledge
The Government of Canada Job Bank website allows you to peruse occupations and explore the skills and
knowledge required to work in these fields. Discover what jobs might be a good match for you at the
Government of Canada Job Bank: http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/es_all-eng.do

Many people find that over the course of their post-secondary program they naturally become more self-aware. It’s
recommended, however, that you take time to do the following in order to facilitate your understanding:
1. Think back to when you were a child. What hopes and dreams did you have for yourself? How have these
changed?
2. Develop a profile of your personality type. One helpful way of classifying personalities was developed by Myers
and Briggs. You can learn more about their personality types by visiting their foundation at Myers and Briggs
Personality Types: www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/.
3. Do an internet search for terms like personal value statement and find examples that inspire you. These
may include key words such as loyalty, accountability, determination, and passion. Now create your own unique
statement that reflects where you are today.
4. Gain a better understanding of yourself by learning how others see you. Ask a close friend, family member, or
trusted academic contact to write down 10 key words that describe you. Notice where these are different or similar
to the words you chose for your value statement.
5. Go back to the introductory chapter of this textbook and make note of the five key sectors of the tourism
industry. With a highlighter or similar tool, choose the two sectors that are the most appealing to you. Why are
these of interest? What life experiences or work experience do you have that apply to these sectors? How do they
align with your personality type and values?
With this foundation in place, you’re ready to face employment reality by gaining a greater understanding of the labour
market.

Step Two: Research the Labour Market
Whether you are career planning for the very first time or you are trying to change careers, gathering labour market
information is necessary to ensure your education and training are relevant. Keep in mind that a career is distinct from
a job. A job can be a part-time or short-term position, whereas a career is work you plan to explore for the length of
your professional life, with each employment opportunity building on the last.
Learning as much as you can about careers within the tourism and hospitality industry will allow you to make good
decisions about your future. Some of the activities you can do to complete your research include visiting job boards to
identify demand and following companies and sectors in the media. Let’s look at these concepts in more detail.

Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 303

Visit Tourism and Hospitality Job Boards to Identify Demand
It’s not enough for you to want to work in a certain field — you have to know what types of jobs are currently being
offered. By visiting job boards you can get a sense of which geographic areas have more opportunities, how much
different jobs pay, and what kind of experience is required.
Websites you can use for this search include:
• The go2HR job board for tourism and hospitality jobs in BC: www.go2hr.ca/jobboard
• Hospitality Works (H Careers): www.hcareers.ca
• HotellerieJobs: www.hotelleriejobs.com/en
• Your local Craigslist classified listings: www.craigslist.org/about/sites
• Listings specific to resort communities (e.g., Whistler: Whistler Job Board:
http://whistlerchamber.chambermaster.com/jobs)
• Career pages for companies like Fairmont Hotels Careers (www.fairmontcareers.com), and JOEY Restaurants
Careers (http://joeyrestaurants.com/careers/)
Make note of any interesting positions, and pay attention to gaps. Compare this to your self-assessment. Where are the
opportunities lining up? What changes might you have to make to advance your career? For example, if you’d like to stay
in the same city, but see no jobs posted that match your needs, it might be time to look elsewhere.

Follow Companies and Sectors in the Media
Make it a point to follow companies and sectors of interest to you in the media. You can do this by using a search
engine to set up notifications (e.g., Google Alerts) about sectors (e.g., restaurants, ski resorts), and following companies
on social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram). You can also monitor news from industry associations to read
their commentary on issues and trends affecting specific sectors of the industry and/or geographic regions. This will
help you identify growth patterns, understand job market trends, and gain an edge should you have the opportunity to
interview.
With this information in hand, you’ll be ready to create a plan.

Spotlight On: The go2HR Job Board
The job board hosted by go2HR is your one-stop shop for tourism and hospitality jobs and careers in
BC. Search by geographic region, keyword, and more. For more information, visit the go2HR Job Board:
https://www.go2hr.ca/jobboard

Step Three: Create Your Career Search Toolkit
You have completed your initial research, and now you need to get down to business! This step involves getting ready to
approach employers about specific opportunities.
304 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

Identify, and be prepared to provide evidence of, the attributes and skills you possess that would be attractive to an
employer. It can be helpful to review these in three categories:
1. Personal attributes: describe what you are like as a person/employee (e.g., your values, personality type, personal
qualities, and characteristics)
2. Technical skills: skills and knowledge required to perform specific work (e.g., how to use restaurant Point-of-Sale
systems, hotel reservations systems, or other computer software)
3. Transferable skills: skills required to perform a variety of tasks that can be transferred from one type of job to
another (e.g., the ability to read a balance sheet and prepare a budget)
Use the list of your skills and attributes when you describe yourself in your documents.

Figure 13.2 Consider a branded set of tools like resumes and business cards to help you stand out from
the crowd.

A standard set of job search documents includes:
1. Cover letter: a long-form document of one page that tells a story, illustrating how your skills and experience make
you an ideal candidate for the job.
2. Resume (sometimes called a curriculum vitae or CV): a point-form document, typically two pages, that
includes your career objective, relevant experience, education, skills, and interests.
3. Reference list: identifies three or four professional contacts who have worked with you, and can vouch for the
quality of your work.
Be sure to update these documents each time you apply for a position and customize them to the opportunity at hand.
You may also want to consider using social media tools and resources to promote yourself. This may include creating
a LinkedIn profile, making a professional (rather than personal) Facebook page, and using Twitter and Instagram
to communicate with companies. Some job seekers also use a professional e-portfolio to demonstrate their skills,

Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 305

knowledge, and abilities. Showcasing your experiences with an e-portfolio is one way to stand out from other applicants
(Lorenzo & Ittleson, 2005).

Take a Closer Look: E-portfolio Tools
This list, updated regularly, was created by EPAC, the Electronic Portfolio Action & Communication listserv.
It provides access to a range of tools for creating e-portfolios with links to key websites. Before using
a specific tool, be sure to check with an instructor to see whether your program has recommended eportfolio platforms at its disposal. To view the list, visit E-portfolio Tools: http://epac.pbworks.com/w/
page/12559686/Evolving%20List%25C2%25A0of%25C2%25A0ePortfolio-related%25C2%25A0Tools

Step Four: Put Your Career Campaign into Action
Now it’s time to make a list of companies to target, and to approach them.
We’ve already addressed how you can find opportunities by scanning postings on websites like the go2HR job board.
This is a great start, but most work opportunities are found in the hidden job market, which consists of jobs that are
not advertised or made public in traditional ways. Many individuals find work in BC’s tourism and hospitality industry by
being referred, getting hired by someone they already know, or starting at an entry-level position and waiting for future
growth opportunities.
If you don’t have any connections in tourism and hospitality, make them! List all the organizations you’re interested in
working for. Now find some key contacts to meet with. These might be:
• The person responsible for hiring within the organization (as noted on its website or in its directory)
• An alumni from your program already working for the company (ask a faculty member to connect you)
• The person who currently works in your ideal role within the company
• A personal contact (family member, friend, or acquaintance) working at the company
Approach your potential contact to set up an informational interview. This is a session where you make contact with
individuals who can use their first-hand experience to educate you about a particular role or company.
Write a short script that will help you remain focused and appear professional as you embark on your first call or send
an initial email. Here’s a sample:
I have five years’ experience working in the tourism and/or hospitality field, mainly holding front-end positions. I have
increased return visitor numbers and received continuous feedback about my outstanding customer service focus. I am
wondering if you have 10 minutes to speak with me.
Your script will change depending on who you are targeting. Prepare a list of questions you want to ask. Remember, at
this stage, you are not asking for a job; you’re asking for advice and gathering information. Don’t ask obvious questions
about information already available on the company’s website or in its print material. Some questions might include:
• What are three words you would use to describe the culture of this company?
• In the time that you’ve worked here, would you say the company has grown? What has changed? What has stayed
306 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

the same?
• What is a day-in-the-life of someone in (name a role) at this company?
• What salary range is available for entry-level employees?
• What types of training and career path support is offered to employees?
• Are there any other people I should be talking to about this? If possible, could you give me their contact
information or introduce me to them?
The conversation should be professional but informal in nature, and many of your questions will be answered in the
natural flow of the conversation. Take notes as you move through the interview, and take a minute after the interview
to fill in details you may have missed while you were there.
After the session, always send a thank-you note. Thank the person for his or her time, and add something specific you
learned in the interview that you believe will be helpful as you navigate your career. Sending an email thank-you is fine,
but sending a written card will help you stand out.
If you’re given the name of someone else to contact, or you are asked to provide further information, be sure to follow
through. This is your opportunity to make a good impression on your contact, and the organization.

Step Five: Engage in Networking
Developing your professional network as an emerging professional in tourism and hospitality is essential. Just as you
need to continue to learn and develop your skill sets, you need to develop and nurture your network; it’s an investment
in your future. Some ways to do this include:
• Conducting multiple informational interviews (covered in the previous step)
• Maintaining contact with academic classmates/faculty
• Attending and presenting at conferences
• Participating in case study competitions and other academic contests
• Using social media networks and groups
• Maintaining good relationships with coworkers at your current job, and staying in touch with people when they

• Asking family and friends to introduce you to tourism and hospitality professionals in their network
Remember that networking is equally about who you know and who knows you; it works both ways. Be generous with
your contacts, information, and resources. As a new professional, you may not have a developed network, but you can
offer your great attitude and valuable ideas, and you will soon gain a reputation as someone who contributes to the field.

Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 307

Figure 13.3 Students eagerly await the start of a networking event

Now that you have a sense of the steps needed to plan your tourism or hospitality career, let’s have a look at an important
tool: work experience, which you can gain while still at school to propel you to your ideal career much faster.

Work Experience
Experiential learning is “based on students being directly involved in a learning experience rather than being recipients
of ready-made content in the form of lectures” (ContactPoint, 2014a). Experiential learning is:
• Action-oriented
• Learner-centred
• Geared toward process, rather than outcomes
In this way, knowledge is created as the learner moves through the experience.
Through your educational program, you may be able to participate in a variety of different learning experiences in
tourism and hospitality. Students who participate in a learning experience outside of the classroom are more likely to
enter the field with both academic and practical workplace skills and knowledge, and have more opportunities for career
advancement.
Let’s have a look at some of the common types of work learning experiences:
• Co-op education
• Internship
• Practicum
• Service learning
308 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

• Volunteering
Each of these is defined below.

Co-op Education
Co-operative, or co-op education refers to “a structured program that integrates work experience in a student’s field
along with academic studies by alternating in-class learning with periods of actual work” (ContactPoint, 2014b, ¶ 1). The
term reflects the co-operative relationship between students, schools, and employers.

Internship
An internship is a temporary on-the-job experience that is “typically offered to students or inexperienced workers”
(ContactPoint, 2014c, ¶ 1). It is generally project-oriented, and supervised.
The intern should have specific learning goals against which he or she can apply experience about a particular industry
or field of work. The term may be paid or unpaid, and may lead to permanent career opportunities with the organization
(ContactPoint, 2014b).

Practicum
A practicum is “applied learning that provides students with practical experience and interaction with professionals
from industry and the community outside of school” (ConnectEd, 2011, p.3). The goal is to support career readiness and
help enhance:
• Higher-order thinking
• Academic skills
• Technical skills
• Applied workplace skills
The experience may be paid or unpaid.

Service Learning
Service learning is defined as a course-based, credit-bearing educational experience in which students:
• Participate in an organized service activity that meets identified community needs
• Reflect on the service activity to gain further understanding of course content, a broader appreciation of the
discipline, and an enhanced sense of civic responsibility (Bringle & Hatcher, 1995)

Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 309

Volunteering
Volunteering involves performing a service without pay in order to obtain work experience, learn new skills, meet
people, contribute to community, and contribute to a cause that’s important to the volunteer (for example, helping
animals, supporting elderly people, working for an environmental cause) (Pickerell, 2014).

Benefits of Work Experience Programs
Students who have completed a formal work experience component benefit from a supportive partnership between the
educational institution, the employer, and themselves. This partnership encourages community stakeholder investment,
student learning opportunities, professional networks, as well as opportunities for employers to participate as coeducators.
Some institutions may work with an experiential education coordinator to ensure a particular position meets the
school’s criteria. Depending on your program, remuneration for work can be by the hour, by salary, by a stipend, as inkind contributions (experiences or services from the business), or as a volunteer assignment. The educational institution
may monitor your placement and ask you to complete an assignment where you reflect on the work experience. Some
programs may have an evaluation component and a supervisor who supports the student’s learning. Students are also
evaluated by the employer, and they will have a supervisor whom they report to directly.
Most often, for students to participate in a work experience program, they are required to maintain a certain grade point
average (GPA) set by the school. Often students are also asked to establish learning goals prior to starting their work
experience.
If your program doesn’t offer a formal work experience program such as a co-op, internship, or practicum, you can still
gain valuable hands-on learning through part-time work and volunteer opportunities. Because tourism is the numberone employer of youth in BC, you can find a part-time job to develop your skills and gain an entry-level opportunity to
join the industry.
Whatever experience you engage in, be it formal, or informal, it’s important to:
• Explore your employer’s organizational culture and social norms
• Do your best on the job
• Gain conflict management and resolution skills
These three keys come directly from BC tourism and hospitality employers (LinkBC, 2014), and are explored in the next
section.

Integrating Planning with Education and Experience
The final career planning element we’ll explore in this chapter involves integrating your education and work experience.
By applying classroom learning to the field, and then bringing lessons from your workplace back to the classroom, you
can see key concepts in action.

310 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

Research Organizational Culture and Social Norms
Each organization has its own culture and social norms. Organizational culture refers to “the customs, rituals, and
values shared by the members of an organization that have to be accepted by new members” (Collins English Dictionary,
2012), and is expressed through its mission statement, vision, beliefs, language systems, and processes. Social norms
refer to the way individuals in the organization interact, communicate, and generally behave with each other.

Figure 13.4 Meet with, and talk to, as many prospective employers as you can. Here, students are talking
to a representative from West Coast Sightseeing.

You will want to understand the culture of an organization before applying for a job there to ensure your values are
congruent. Find out what’s important to the organization by researching the business. How does it present its public
face?
Asking questions of a potential employer about the organization’s culture will help you assess whether it is a good fit for
you. You can do this by asking employees in the organization during the informational interview; or alternatively, in a
formal job interview.

Performance on the Job
This is your time to shine — no matter what role you’ve been assigned. In addition to respecting and working within
a company’s culture, once you start your position, it’s time for you to show initiative (Iannarino, n.d.). Demonstrate an
interest in learning and contributing to the organization’s goals and objectives and you will stand out from other
employees.
Act without waiting to be told what to do and persistently follow through on work responsibilities, regardless of the
obstacles. Think about ways to improve operations, and come up with new ideas, while presenting these in a way that
Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 311

shows you respect management’s expertise. It’s up to you to signal to your employer that you’re someone who can be
counted on and you have leadership potential. Some ways of showing initiative include:
• Asking to observe a meeting
• Asking to shadow a manager in another department
• Reading through company policies and plans, and asking questions about them
• Offering to bring your skills to the table to make a difference, such as setting up a social media account for the
company or creating a training manual for future students in your position
Often, you’ll be able to take advantage of project work at school to accomplish some of the above.

Practise Conflict Management and Resolution
The majority of tourism and hospitality employers stress that conflict management is an essential skill in this customerservice driven industry (LinkBC, 2014). It’s up to you to practise these skills at your workplace.
In most conflicts, the ultimate goal must be to find a resolution. Avoiding or ignoring conflict is not an effective strategy.
While resolving conflict can be uncomfortable, unresolved conflict actually makes the situation worse. Generally,
conflicts have more than one cause. How you choose to resolve conflicts will ultimately demonstrate your ability to be
professional and move upward in your career.
Consider the following three steps to resolving conflicts both at work and in the classroom.

Listen
If at all possible, try not to take the situation or comments personally. Do not make assumptions about people’s
motivations. Jumping to conclusions adds to the conflict and creates more tension and issues to work though.
Consider that if there is a conflict, you might not have fully understood the issue or your part in it. While you may not
like the style or approach of the person you’re interacting with, set the goal of listening with acceptance with the intent
to resolve the conflict. Convey that you are listening respectfully through your body language and tone of voice, and
don’t interrupt. If there are several people involved, let everyone have a chance to speak.

Reflect and Summarize
If you need to, silently count to 10 in your head to give yourself the time to respond appropriately. Acknowledge your
commitment to resolving the conflict, and clarify how the other person is feeling about it. When people feel listened
to, they are often willing to take the first step toward trust, which then creates willingness to work through the issue.
Summarizing what the other person has said allows you to ensure that you’ve fully captured his or her position.
Focus on appreciating what the other person is saying and thinking to understand the source of conflict. Ask what the
other person believes would resolve the conflict. Focus the conversation on mutually resolving the issue.

312 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

Respond
Allow each person the opportunity to explore solutions equally. Take a break from the process if you need to, and come
back to the conflict when you feel refreshed. Often the solution is through compromise, because no one is all wrong or
all right in any given situation. Each time you’re given the chance to respond, do your best to keep language neutral.
By maturely moving through the process of listening, reflecting, summarizing, and responding (and sometimes going
back to the start again), you’ll not only demonstrate your workplace potential, but gain valuable skills for your personal
life.
While adapting to organizational culture, demonstrating strong on-the-job performance, and practising conflict
resolution are important, there are many skills to be learned in the workplace. Others include the ability to apply critical
thinking, acting as a global citizen, and working as part of a team. With this in mind, let’s have a look at success stories
in our industry — graduates who possess these skills and attributes, and have used them to propel their careers forward.

Tourism and Hospitality Success Stories
Just a few years ago the professionals highlighted in this section were students in the classroom. Here, they tell us firsthand what you need to know in order to grow in BC’s tourism and hospitality industry. These success stories span the
following sectors:
• Accommodation (account manager, rooms division coordinator)
• Recreation and entertainment (project coordinator, conference services manager, entrepreneur and small business
owner)
• Travel services (long-range planner, travel designer, industry and communications services manager)
As you read their stories, you’ll see that many of the themes explored in this chapter are echoed in their advice. Please
note that these profiles were current as of spring 2015 – some of these grads may already be on to the next big thing in
their careers!

Accommodation
Brock Martin, Account Manager

Figure 13.5 Brock Martin

Brock manages accounts for Canada Booking.com Online Reservations Inc. He graduated with a bachelor of hospitality
management at Vancouver Community College in 2010. Brock says:
I oversee more than 300 accommodations on Vancouver Island and am their point of contact for day-to-day
support and for assisting them in maximizing their listing’s potential with Booking.com. When I moved to
Vancouver in 2004, I started my first hotel job at the Westin Bayshore as a banquet server. I still remember my
first day; we had to serve a dinner for over 1,200 people, and I remember that despite how crazy it was I knew
this was the industry for me!
From there, I moved to the Pacific Palisades Hotel in banquets, and then I was given an opportunity to move
to the front desk. I remember thinking at first that I didn’t belong at the front desk as I had always just done
food and beverage. I did not think I would fit the position. Well, I was wrong! I immediately knew I loved the
interactions with the guests.
I progressed with my career, moving from a front desk agent to an assistant front office manager, where I
stayed until the hotel unfortunately closed its doors in 2010. Following the Palisades, I held various front office
management positions with Coast Hotels and Delta Hotels in Vancouver, Nanaimo, and Whistler. In 2013, I was
presented with an opportunity to join Booking.com as an account manager, where I am presently working.
Taking courses related to hospitality management and tourism will really assist in developing your career. Once
in a workplace setting, continued education is key. Look for opportunities for cross training and job shadowing,
and ask Human Resources about internal training programs to further your understanding.
Students entering this industry need to have a passion for guest services and for helping people. They need to
be able to think quickly and be a good problem solver. This is a fast-paced, ever-evolving industry and doesn’t fit
someone who likes routine. No two days are ever the same, and that is what I love! Remain flexible and do not
be afraid to try new things. Have an open mind and challenge yourself to think outside of the box.
Specific things students can do to get ahead include networking, further training, and volunteering. Remember,
the industry is very large, yet small at the same time. Take opportunities to volunteer as these are great
314 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

networking opportunities as well. I couldn’t picture myself in any other industry. It is challenging, yet rewarding,
and best of all, it is a lot of fun!

Katie Clarke, Marketing Coordinator

Figure 13.6 Katie Clarke

Katie works at the Parkside Hotel & Spa in Victoria, BC. She graduated with a diploma in hospitality management from
Vancouver Island University in 2011. Katie says:
My initial hotel job was with the Fairmont Empress housekeeping department during my first co-op work term, a
temporary two-month position after which I returned for my second year of schooling. After graduating from
Vancouver Island University, I completed my last co-op semester by working at the Queen Victoria Hotel and
Suites as a guest services agent. My employment continued there after my co-op term was complete, and lasted
until the hotel was sold in October 2012. I left with a wealth of knowledge in guest services.
I began working at the Parkside Hotel & Spa at the time it was purchased by a group of Vancouver Island local
investors. I started in reservations, which was a new department in the early stages of development, and my skills
and qualifications played a large role in assisting with the department’s foundations. I worked as a reservations
agent for seven months before I was promoted to the position of rooms division coordinator. In this position,
I assisted in supervising the department, as well as taking on some marketing responsibilities such as keeping
the hotel website up-to-date, social media, print materials, and much, much more. The role became a jack-ofall-trades position and was a great experience! In fact, I used what I learned in that role to obtain my current
position of marketing coordinator.
My advice for students is that any related education will always help get your foot in the door of a hotel. All
applicable work experience, skills, and knowledge can also be an advantage. If you are a hard worker, a team
player, and willing to help out when other departments need it, you will be successful in any job you do.
Students should understand that the hospitality field can be a career. Some people view a job in the hospitality
industry as temporary or seasonal employment, but it can be a career with many exciting opportunities if you
Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 315

stick with it. The great thing about working in a hotel is that there are so many different departments to explore.
The options are endless.
Networking can provide an advantage in this industry. If you contact your tourism bureau, it can connect you
to organizations to help you further your industry network. Creating great workplace relationships also fosters
getting ahead in any industry. Be sure to keep up with new training and volunteering, as that can be a great
advantage, and most workplaces encourage it!
Though every job will come with its tough days, push past them as there are so many better days ahead! Work
hard and it will pay off!

Recreation and Entertainment
Ana Rowinska, Project Coordinator

Figure 13.7 Ana Rowinska

Ana works for MCI Group Canada. She has multiple credentials including a hospitality restaurant management diploma
from Douglas College (2005), an Event Marketing Association certificate from BCIT (2008), and a bachelor of tourism
management from Capilano University (2013). Ana says:
My love for travel and hospitality were key reasons I took the hospitality restaurant management diploma
program at Douglas College. After receiving my diploma, I decided to focus on event marketing and enrolled at
BCIT for further training.
Students interested in getting into events and or event marketing need to be able to multi-task, be organized,
and have a hard work ethic. Both education and experience are important to work as an event coordinator. You
need to know the ins and outs of the industry by working in events, and you also need to understand the backend strategies of how to implement, organize, and plan events.
316 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

The events industry is not your typical nine-to-five job. Long workdays are common, and you can expect to
sometimes work 16 or more hours in one day to get the job done. Events can happen any day of the week, at any
time. Commitment and the ability to be flexible is key as you are always the first one on scene and the last one
to leave. You need to have patience, be organized, and be able to deal with stress.
Many students expect to be hired at at a high level right after graduation, but in truth, most will be entering the
workforce in their respective fields in an entry-level position. You’ll need to be prepared to work toward gaining
experience with your company before you can move into a supervisor or manager position. My advice is to work
hard, learn, and ask questions, and you will succeed.
Volunteering or working part time with events is key as you will not only gain valuable industry experience, you
will also be networking with your future peers. Experience is invaluable in our sector, so the more events you
work or volunteer in, the more opportunities you will have to expand your network and meet key stakeholders
in the event industry.
To be successful, you need to be organized, have excellent communication skills, and be able to handle stress
and pressure. Don’t get discouraged if things don’t happen exactly like you planned; life throws you curve balls,
and it’s how you deal with those curve balls that allows you to succeed in our industry.
Throughout my career, I have needed to make decisions on what was next for me. You never know which job
may lead you to where, so treat each job as a stepping stone to move ahead in your career.

Christine McCann, Senior Conference Services Manager

Figure 13.8 Christine McCann

Christine is in senior management at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler. She graduated from the Douglas College program
in hotel and restaurant management in 2006. Christine says:
I started at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler as a SWEP (student work experience) student in the banquet
Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 317

department. From there, I became very interested in the organization and execution of events, weddings,
and conferences. During my time as a banquet server, I was able to cross train with conference services, allowing
me to gain insights into the skills and knowledge required to be a successful member of the that team. When
a position opened up for a conference services coordinator, I was overjoyed to receive a role as part of this
fantastic team! Seven years have passed, and I am now in the position of senior conference services manager,
taking care of many large groups throughout the year.
Event and conference planning is a very interesting blend of roles: being on the floor with clients and groups
but also completing many administrative tasks and paperwork to ensure plans are effectively communicated. A
positive attitude, passion for creating outstanding events, and an eye for detail are three key qualities needed.
Members of my team have moved here from many other departments, including banquets, front office, sales,
and food and beverage; however, having a base of operations experience is the normal pathway to a position in
conference services.
Being successful in a conference services role takes passion and an understanding and appreciation for the guest
experience. We are ambassadors for our brand to our guests — 100 to 1,000 guests at a time — and it is important
that we ensure each one feels a special connection to our venue and location.
A positive attitude, willingness to learn and passion for whatever role you choose will always help you on the
road to success.
Volunteering is a fantastic way to try out new roles and meet great contacts. Hands-on experience can be
invaluable in the future. Continuing to seek knowledge, through training, education, industry events — whatever
method is interesting for you — will also be beneficial.
Love what you do, work hard, and listen!

David Woolridge, Entrepreneur and Small Business Owner
David is the owner and founder of Ridge Wilderness Adventures Ltd. He graduated from the outdoor recreation
management program at Capilano University in 2002. David says:
I love people and I love being outside, so I searched for positions that would fill that need. I have worked at canoe
rental companies, guiding outfits, first-aid schools, retail shops, construction, and anything else that I could get
my hands on.
I recommend students get into the field by one of two means: enter a specific program like the one at Capilano
University, or contact a company that does the work they would like to do and apply. If applying directly doesn’t
work, ask the company what it is looking for in a person to be employable.
This work is for those who don’t like to have a fixed routine and who thrive on problem solving and like to do
different things all the time. If you prefer a set schedule and set pay, it is probably not for you.
It’s an amazing job where we get to work at what we love. To succeed in this line of work, attitude and availability
trump aptitude. If you would like to have a lucrative career in the outdoors, you need to possess an outgoing,
friendly, hardworking attitude. This style of work is not nine-to-five; in fact, it’s the opposite of that. Your ability
to work when the work is there is key to success. Obviously, you need to have the ability to do the work, but 9
times out of 10, if that’s all you have you will not succeed.
This industry is all about the people that you know. Go to every event and course you can to meet people and
318 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

get known. Most places will give you the training; you need to do the work if your attitude is right, so sort out
what you need before you start.
If you love the outdoors, love people, and want to have fun for work, this is what you should do.

Cleopatra Corbett, Long-Range Planner

Figure 13.9 Cleopatra Corbett

Cleopatra works as a planner for the City of Vernon. She holds a bachelor of tourism management from Vancouver Island
University (2004) and completed the urban design certificate at Simon Fraser University in 2012. Cleopatra says:
My first experience in community planning came during my third-year co-op work term as a planning assistant
with the District of Ucluelet. I instantly fell in love with the profession: working with local residents, businesses,
non-profits, and elected officials to realize a desired future for the community. Upon graduation, I continued to
work in Ucluelet, followed by Tofino, Golden, and now Vernon, all in British Columbia.
In my field the desired skill set includes planning, communication, collaboration, facilitation, public speaking,
and report writing. For knowledge, you need planning history and theory, community development,
environmental stewardship, marketing, and statistical and research methods. As for education, you want to
study planning, geography, urban design, tourism, recreation, history, and law.
Community planning is incredibly challenging and rewarding work. Put simply, your work can have a tremendous
impact on the environment and the quality of life for residents in your community. You help the community
dream about a desired future and then develop policy to make it happen.

Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 319

My advice would be to have mentors you respect and admire, and to meet with them regularly to ask questions
and look for advice. Always do your best, work hard with integrity, be kind, tell the truth, and do what you love.
Get experience before graduating through volunteer work, internships, and/or co-op work terms. Also, try to
apply course projects in university to real-world projects for businesses, non-profits, or governments in order to
gain meaningful applied experience. Interview people who are in positions that interest you; ask questions and
don’t be afraid to ask for help.
If you are willing to move, you can get any type of job you desire. Being mobile enhances your opportunities.
Practise life-long learning and strive for a healthy work-life balance. Follow your bliss and make the world a
better place.

Marie-Catherine Lapointe, Travel Designer Team Lead

Figure 13.10 Marie-Catherine Lapointe

Marie-Catherine is a travel designer with Discover Holidays Inc. She graduated from Capilano University with a diploma
of tourism management in 2012. Marie-Catherine says:
When I graduated, I knew that I wanted to work in travel services as a central part of the industry with touch
points in every other sector, so when a posting to be a travel designer for a receptive tour operator came up, I
jumped at the chance. I was excited to be working to bring clients from all over the world to Canada, and I took
in every opportunity to learn about the many aspects of the company, including product, marketing, and sales.
Students wanting to get into the tour operator sector need to have a tourism education to really understand
the intricacies of the sectors in the industry, as well as skills in customer service, sales, cultural practices
(particularly dealing with international clients), marketing, and a real passion for the products they are selling.
Teamwork is crucial on our small team, as is being intrinsically motivated to provide the best experience for
clients.
First, receptive tour operators are not travel agents, nor do they operate the tours. We work with travel agents,
wholesale agents, and occasionally with clients directly. However, it is mainly a B2B model. Receptive tour
operators are in a dynamic workplace, with opportunities to learn and gain experience in other sectors and
fields, as well as hone customer service and sales skills.
320 | Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience

My advice is to really take hold of every opportunity that is presented, and to never stop learning about the
industry. This is a very social industry and building a large solid network can help with future opportunities.
Build up your customer service experience, whether it’s through front-line jobs or volunteering, and attend
networking events. Schools often host or sponsor these, and students should be attending them all.
This is a really fun industry, and with so many sectors and positions available, I really believe that there is
something for everyone in tourism.

Jody Young, Industry and Community Services Manager

Figure 13.11 Jody Young

Jody works for Tourism Vancouver Island. She holds a bachelor of tourism management from Vancouver Island
University (2008). Jody says:
After graduation, it took a year and a half before I got my big break into the industry. I’m thankful for the time
it took for my career to really start as it provided me the opportunity to travel around Southeast Asia. I started
at Tourism Vancouver Island in an entry-level position as the distribution coordinator. After just one year in
the role I was promoted to industry services coordinator where I was coordinating the association’s annual
conference and AGM and conducting accommodation inspections. After another year and a half, I was promoted
again to management level within the organization to the role I am currently in. As industry and community
services manager, I oversee many portfolios for the organization such as community tourism development, event
management, research, and promotion of the value of tourism.
The tourism management degree program at Vancouver Island University definitely set me up for success in this
role. I highly recommend completing the four-year degree and getting as much hands-on, real-world experience
that you can while completing your education. Employers will be looking for proven successes and workplace
skills, not just completion of courses.
Although the tourism industry is vast with many desirable, well-paying career opportunities, it is still fairly
Chapter 13. Careers and Work Experience | 321

new. The industry has room to grow on communicating that it is a key economic and social contributor to our
province and country.
I would advise students to jump at an entry-level opportunity as it will be your door to advancing in your career
in a particular organization. Once you’ve got your foot in the door, demonstrate your ability and you will soon
find bigger opportunities presented to you. If I didn’t take the entry-level opportunity that was presented to me,
I wouldn’t be in the role I am in today.
Students can get ahead by taking advantage of student rates at industry events. By attending these industry
events you will rub shoulders with the folks who are at the top of the game in this industry and meeting potential
future employers. Look for opportunities for mentorship programs or internships to gain that workplace
experience as well.

Conclusion
As you can see, successful tourism and hospitality careers depend on reaching out and meeting people (networking),
gaining practical experience, having a great attitude and work ethic, and committing to ongoing learning about the
world, the industry, and yourself.
With diligence and a sense of exploration, you can launch your dream career in tourism and hospitality,
today. Remember that career planning is an ongoing process — the more you practise the steps in this chapter, the more
likely your success.
Now that you’ve explored the five sectors of tourism, special considerations, and your own place in the industry, it’s

and Trends
GEOFFREY BIRD AND EUGENE THOMLINSON

Learning Objectives

• Identify the impacts and benefits globalization has on the tourism industry, as well as tourism’s influence
on globalization
• Use the PEEST model to describe political, economic, environmental, social, and technological trends
affecting global tourism and travel
• Define key terms related to globalization
• Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the interplay of globalization and tourism

Overview

Figure 14.1 Around the world

In today’s integrated and interdependent world, multiple forces represent both opportunities and threats to
tourism. This chapter explores the topic of globalization and how it relates to tourism, and then examines trends

326 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

(political, economic, environmental, societal, and technological influences). The chapter closes with a reflection on what
all this means for tourism in British Columbia.

Globalization and the Tourism Industry
Depending on the focus of the discussion, globalization can be defined in several ways. One broad definition is:
A complex web of social processes that intensify and expand worldwide economic, cultural, political and
technological exchanges and connections. (Campbell, MacKinnon, & Stevens, 2011, p.4)
Globalization can also be simply described as the movement of goods, ideas, values, and people around the world. The
term was first used in the early 1950s to recognize the increasing interdependence of economies and societies around
the world. Globalization, however, has existed for centuries by way of evolving trade routes, including the slave trade,
colonization, and immigration.

Figure 14.2 Bye floating market in Thailand

Today, we are divided into separate countries, each looking out for its own national self-interest. At the same time, other
entities such as multinational corporations cross borders, which leads to global economic and political integration.
Many benefits can result from global integration and interdependence, but we also need to heed its negative effects.

Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 327

We can look at the relationship between globalization and tourism in several ways. For the purposes of this chapter, we
will consider the impact of tourism and travel on globalization, and the impact of globalization on tourism. But first,
let’s keep in mind why it is important for a local tour operator, general manager, or tourism business owner to think
about globalization. More importantly, let’s consider where we should be looking to understand globalization and future
trends. The rest of this chapter will address these topics.

The Impact of Globalization on Tourism
We can assess the impact of globalization on tourism from a number of perspectives. Here, we will discuss five examples:
global mobility and ease of travel; population and demographic trends; terrorism, safety, and security; increased
awareness of new destinations; and poverty.

Global Mobility and Ease of Travel
The advances made in transportation that have enabled global mobility are particularly significant. Modern aircraft,
cruise ships, trains, and other modes of transport allow people to move quickly and relatively cheaply. Aircraft such as
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner have opened new routes by creating an aircraft capable of flying “long haul” distances with
a larger passenger load. Fast trains, road systems, and even city bike rental programs enable people to move, tour, and
explore the world. These changes have allowed more people to travel more often in less time.

Figure 14.3 The Vancouver International Airport official opening in 1931

Ease of travel has also helped to overcome the barriers of fear, frustration, and expense. For example, an international
banking system allows access to money almost anywhere in the world. Multinational corporations, which provide flights,
local transportation, and accommodation and food, have allowed for “one-stop shopping” for travel bookings. Handheld
devices have also changed the nature of travel in terms of what travellers do and how they interact with a destination,
making it easier to, for example, select a restaurant, navigate a big city, or translate a foreign language. As a result, there
are fewer unexplored places in the world anymore.

Population and Demographic Trends
According to the United Nations Population Fund (2015), the world population reached 7 billion in 2011 and is projected
to exceed 9 billion by 2050. The population continues to increase, but not uniformly across the world. Birth and
death rates are vastly different between developed and developing nations (Population Reference Bureau, 2013). In the
developed world, there are more older citizens (over 60 years old) than there are children (under 14). This ratio, which
328 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

first tilted in favour of older people in the late 1990s, is increasing (Business Insider, 2014). In contrast, in the developing
world, this is not expected to occur until the middle of this century. This demographic divide is expected to widen
between the richer and poorer countries of the world in the near future before possibly trending together in 40 or 50
years.
Other critical population trends affecting global development and tourism include the following (UNPF, 2015; World
Tourism Organization, 2010; York, 2014):
• There are approximately 1.8 billion young people in the world (between 10 and 24 years), which is the largest that
this group has ever been. They have tremendous opportunity for economic and social progress, resulting in a
“youth dividend” for countries that embrace this demographic and their youthful vitality. This group is also
travelling more than ever before in history.
• By the end of this century, approximately 40% of the world’s population is expected to be African. While birth rates
are tending to fall around the world, they are still higher across Africa than in most other parts of the globe. This
could result in a youth dividend or further exacerbate problems on the African continent.
• More people are migrating than ever before, with 232 million recent migrants compared with about 175 million in
2000. The top five destinations are the United States, the Russian Federation, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates.
• More than half of the global population is urban, and the urbanization trend is expected to continue as people
search for more jobs, more services, and more activities. Not everyone benefits equally though, as housing and
other infrastructure struggles to keep up with the growing urban population.
To keep up with all of these changes in demographics, destinations will need to provide products and services to suit the
older, culturally diverse, multi-generational travellers as well as the adventurous youth. Additionally, hiring and retaining
staff will require a rethinking of human resource policies and procedures, compensation, and other aspects for the
changing population of employees.

Terrorism, Safety, and Security
Terrorist attacks and political unrest globally have certainly disrupted tourism, but not halted it. The areas most
affected, of course, are those where unrest has occurred and has been the focus of extensive media attention. A global
terrorism index produced by the Vision of Humanity organization shows a fivefold increase in terrorist fatalities since
9/11 (MacAskill, 2014). The Islamic State (ISIS), Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qaida are groups responsible for many
of the 18,000 terrorism-related deaths in 2013, which represented an increase of 60% over the previous year.
While safety and security may not be the driving reasons for tourists selecting a particular destination, certainly a lack
of safety and security often eliminates a location from travellers’ “wish lists.”
Safety and security for travellers is becoming more important as countries move to protect their citizens. Government
agencies around the world produce advisories and warnings for their citizens to stay away from dangerous locations
and political unrest.

Take a Closer Look: Travel Advisories
Travel advisories serve as warning systems for people from specific countries to avoid particular destinations

Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 329

because of actual or potential threats to citizens. To learn more about advisories for specific countries, see
the Canadian government page at Canada’s Travel Advisories (http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories) and
compare them to Australia’s Travel Advisories (http://www.smartraveller.gov.au), the United States’ Travel
Advisories

(http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html),

and

the

United

Kingdom’s Travel Advisories (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice).

The focus on safety and security has had several impacts on travellers. Most notably, security at most airports has been
increased in an effort to protect people and planes (Flight Global, 2015). Screening procedures can take longer and
some items are no longer allowed on board. Other security requirements, such as showing passports and providing
fingerprints, have been implemented for entry into some countries. While all acts of terrorism cannot be stopped, the
tourism industry is attempting to provide as much safety and security as it can.

Increased Awareness of New Destinations
Another influence of globalization on tourism is a greater awareness of destinations and the range of leisure activities,
sites, and cultures to visit around the world. Generating knowledge of a destination is obviously a key first step in
marketing a destination, and this is achieved by way of travel shows, films, blogs, and other forms of communication. The
competition to attract visitors is fierce considering the sheer number of places available for travel; it can be easy to get
lost in the noise of global competition.

Poverty

Figure 14.4 This image of a child playing in the streets of Guatemala was captured by a visitor.

330 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

Globalization has contributed to increased demand for goods and services and overall economic growth, with the
result of global poverty having decreased over the years. However, at the same time, the gap between the richest and
poorest has expanded. A significant portion of the world’s population is simply unable to participate in, or benefit from,
tourism. The economic gains from a tourism economy in a developing country such as Honduras versus a developed
country such as Canada is unequal. Simply put, not everyone has the same opportunities to profit. Environmental
costs are also unevenly distributed in the world, with poor countries lacking the resources to adapt to impacts (such
as droughts, increased disease, soil erosion), and shouldering the majority of the repercussions of phenomena such as
global warming.
Another way to analyze the interplay between tourism and globalization is to consider the reverse view: the impact of
tourism on globalization.

Impact of Tourism on Globalization
In this section, we will look at tourism as a global force — for peace, for cultural homogenization, for commodifying
cultures, and for shaping the way we see the world.

Tourism as a Force for Peace
In the 1980s, a popular hypothesis was that tourism supported global peace by allowing travellers to learn about other
cultures and meet people from other nations, as well as offering benefits accrued from international business. Peace
is an obvious requirement for tourism if the industry is to be robust and sustainable. However, to date, there is little
empirical evidence to support the claim that tourism fosters peace, however attractive as the idea may be.

Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 331

Tourism as Cultural Homogenizer

Figure 14.5 A “Patriotic Kick Line” on a cruise from Alaska to Vancouver

Nevertheless, tourism does offer the opportunity to teach people about how to respect other cultures. Some argue that
globalization has a homogenizing effect on cultures, as Western values are spread through music, fashion, film, and
food, rendering one culture indistinguishable from the next.
Some beliefs and values, such as embracing equality and diversity, or the need to protect children from harm, should be
shared around the world. In the context of tourism and travel, these two issues are significant. For instance, companies
need to ensure that their human resource practices are consistent and fair throughout the world. Exploiting children
for sex is illegal, punishable in both the country visited and the home country of the tourist; some airlines and hotels are
actively involved in supporting the prohibition of child sex tourism. Travellers are expected not to deface heritage sites
or take rare or endangered natural or cultural objects as souvenirs. Such regulations speak to the universality of certain
values and beliefs, which we all are required to follow as global citizens.

332 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

Tourism as Commodifier

Figure 14.6 Dancers at Germaine’s Luau near Honolulu, Hawaii

Another possible influence of tourism on globalization is the process of cultural commodification, which refers to
the drive toward putting a monetary value on every aspect of culture, from buying a sculpture stolen from an ancient
temple, to buying endangered objects such as ivory and coral. This trend results in the degradation or devaluing of
cultural values and beliefs and was explored in Chapter 12 on aboriginal tourism.
As one of the world’s largest industries, tourism impacts local, regional, and global economies. Resorts dot coastlines
around the world and offer a welcome respite from colder climates to anyone wishing to experience a tropical beach,
as well as the local culture and nature. While benefit comes to the community in the form of jobs, more often than not
the larger share of the wealth leaks offshore. In response, local entrepreneurs and aid organizations have helped with
initiatives that embrace local ownership in order for the wealth generated from tourism to stay in country. Communitybased tourism, responsible tourism, and social entrepreneurship all aim to bring greater benefit to local communities.

Tourism As a World View
Tourism is also a major influence in how we see and understand the world. Keith Hollinshead (2006) refers to it as
tourism world-making, or the way in which a place or culture is marketed and/or presented to tourists. Unlike local
people, travellers experience a place for a few days, with limited knowledge of the culture and local way of life. Some
visitors rely on available tourist information to make the most of the experience and to see the highlights. Others turn
away and attempt to “go local” in search of the authentic experience with the belief that they can truly understand a
place by avoiding the tourist sites.
Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 333

Figure 14.7. An elephant is washed at Maesa Elehant Camp in Thailand in preparation for a show for
visitors

If tourists stay in their resort in a given country, their only interaction with a local culture may be the staff at the hotel. In
many cases, visitors experience a place in a fragmented, disconnected way, seeing only a portion of a place. How much
can be gained from such short and transient experiences? This debate leads to one of the often discussed, if not hotly
debated, topics in tourism, that of authenticity of experience. In 1976, Dean MacCannell released his book The Tourist:
A New Theory of the Leisure Class, in which he argued that even those events that seem to be authentic are in some way
staged for the visitor (Drumond, 2013).

Take a Closer Look: Cannibal Tours
In 1988, Dean O’Rourke shot a documentary profiling the experiences of jet-set travellers as they
encountered locals in Papua New Guinea. The movie highlights the challenges that happen when visitors
meet with “the other,” in that their expectations shape the behaviours of the locals. The movie features

Top Trends
Throughout this textbook, a range of trends have been identified that exemplify some of the forces and influences
associated with globalization. This section revisits some of those trends.

Take a Closer Look: Trends Reports
In the tourism and hospitality industry, and in global business, many minds work to decipher industry trends
in order to keep informed and make smart decisions. One example is the Global Competitiveness Report, a
product of the World Economic Forum, which can be read here: Global Competitiveness Report, 2014-2015:
http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015
The UNWTO produces a World Tourism Barometer that is updated regularly, available on a subscription
basis: http://mkt.unwto.org/barometer

First, let’s take a closer look at the difference between trends and fads. While trends and fads may look the same
initially, fads will almost always have a definite start and end; they are finite. Examples include tornado tourism (storm
chasing tours) and shack tourism (where affluent people stay in impoverished neighbourhoods), which appear destined
to disappear as quickly as they appeared.
In contrast, trends influence things for long periods of time, potentially shifting the focus or direction of industry and
society in a completely different direction. For example, the growing awareness of tourism impacts seems to be a longterm trend, leading to greater focus on developing sustainable experiences, products, and services for the mindful
traveller. With hindsight, we can identify the trends versus the fads. Predicting the future, however, is not as easy.
A useful tool to use in the analysis of global trends is PEEST, an acronym for political, economic, environmental, social,
and technological forces that affect the person, organization, or destination under study. Let’s delve into PEEST in more
detail.

Take a Closer Look: Analysis Tools
The more complicated the world gets, the more it’s imperative that business leaders and decision-makers
employ a framework for analyzing trends. While this chapter uses a PEEST approach, other acronyms include
PEST (omitting the environmental review), or PESTLE (including legal and environmental reviews). For more
information about these frameworks, to access templates, and learn to use them in your own analysis,
visit PEST Analysis Free Template: www.businessballs.com/pestanalysisfreetemplate.htm

Political Trends
While we may be intrigued by global issues and their macro implications on the world in which we live, we also need to
pay attention to local politics and policies. Let’s have a look at political trends from different scales.
Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 335

Global Policies

Figure 14.8 The secretary-general of UNWTO visits Greece in 2012

According to the UNWTO report Policy and Practice for Global Tourism, whereas “growth and development were major
priorities in the period since the 1950s, the new millennium is characterised by intense destination competition” (2011,
p.3). Traditional Western destinations are under pressure to formulate policies and create strategies and spending
patterns that will enable them to compete with emerging destinations.

Spotlight On: The International Civil Aviation Organization
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was created in 1944 with the signing of the Chicago
Convention as a specialized agency of the United Nations. It works with 191 countries to help develop aviation
policies and build capacity in countries with underdeveloped air industries. For more information, visit the
International Civil Aviation Organization website: www.icao.int

Each country is responsible for creating and funding its own organizations responsible for tourism development at the
federal, state/provincial, and local level. In the United States, for example, the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries
(OTTI) is responsible for actively participating in domestic and international policy creation. One such policy is a
memorandum of understanding with China regarding leisure group travel. The OTTI is engaged in international tourism
discussions with organizations such as the OECD and APEC (see Spotlight On below), and has a representative at
UNWTO (OTTI, n.d).

336 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

Spotlight On: International Economic Groups
On the international stage, several groups are responsible for developing and setting policy that has an
impact on tourism development. Two examples are:
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has 31 member countries that
gather to discuss a range of policy issues, with a special committee dedicated to tourism. For more
information, visit the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development website: www.oecd.org/
cfe/tourism/
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum also has a Tourism Working Group that recognizes
the importance of sustainable tourism development for countries in the Asia Pacific Rim region. For more
information, visit the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation website: www.apec.org/Groups/SOM-SteeringCommittee-on-Economic-and-Technical-Cooperation/Working-Groups/Tourism.aspx

National Policies
While from a policy perspective, countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom
have embraced tourism growth through a planned approach, tourism policy in Canada tends to struggle in comparison
to the attention given to other sectors such as oil and gas.
A number of organizations, including the Conference Board of Canada and the Tourism Industry Association of Canada,
have made recommendations for strong government policy support that could help strengthen the industry. Two key
policy reforms suggested include (Deloitte, 2013):
1. Changes to air travel regulations, such as increasing air access, phasing out rents paid by airports to the federal
government, and transferring airport ownership to local authorities
2. Streamlining the travel visa issuance process, using technology to make it faster for visitors to obtain visas and
continue to pursue visa-related partnerships with other countries

Take a Closer Look: Passport to Growth — How International Tourist Arrivals Stimulate Canadian Exports
A 2013 report from Deloitte details the ways in which the tourism industry supports overall economic
development in Canada. It highlights industry trends and summarizes recommendations made by tourism
industry advocates for enhancing the sector. For more information visit, Passport to Growth [PDF]:
http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ca/Documents/press-releases/ca-en-tourism-andtrade.pdf

Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 337

Spotlight On: The Five Country Conference
The Five Country Conference (FCC) is a partnership of the governments of Australia, Canada, the New
Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States. Their goal is to work together to restrict the travel of
individuals who pose security and immigration risks, and at the same time increase the efficiency and
customer service for other travellers. For more information, visit www.fivecountryconference.org

The trend here may be the ongoing need to convince and lobby governments at all levels of the potential of tourism and
the value of strategic planning and investment in tourism. It is perhaps not surprising that the tourism and hospitality
sector, with such diverse organizations involved, struggles to find a single voice at times. This leads to a cycle where
the sector rallies around initiatives such as Expo 86 and the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, and then
experiences a period of fragmentation.

Figure 14.9 BC businesses, including this pub,
rallied around the bid to bring the 2010 Olympic
Winter Games to Vancouver

Environmental Trends
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has produced irrefutable evidence that climate change
is human-made. We are already witnessing significant shifts in weather patterns, and climatic events such as tornadoes,
drought, and flooding are occurring with greater frequency and impact. Yet dependence on a global economy fuelled by
population growth and ever-increasing demand for consumer goods has led to significant debate as to how to respond
to climate change, although action is clearly required.

338 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

Environmental Impacts
From a tourism and travel perspective, we have seen examples throughout the chapters of this textbook of how
climate change is impacting tourism. In the transportation sector, drastic temperature changes from sudden ice thaws
to heatwave conditions affect highways and runways, landslides close road systems, and rising sea levels threaten
infrastructure such as airports and cruise ship wharves. In the accommodations sector, coastal storms impact resorts,
summer water shortages put pressure on resort communities, and unpredictable snowfalls close ski resorts. Food
and beverage operators are facing increased food costs as drought conditions make growing certain crops more and
more expensive. In the recreation and entertainment sector, both natural and built attractions are threatened by
unpredictable weather patterns. And travel services providers struggle to stay abreast of the effects of superstorms and
polar vortexes.
The question here is the extent to which we can globally respond to these impacts by adapting and mitigating climate
change to foster more resilient forms of economic growth, of which tourism is a part. Does this mean less air travel?
Possibly. The challenge for tourism is that our economic interdependence requires far-reaching transportation routes,
be it by air, sea, or land.

Economic Trends
Like most other industrial sectors, tourism is affected by global economic trends. Tourism was initially negatively
impacted after the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, with international tourism arrivals dropping globally
(Papatheodorou, Rossello, & Xiao, 2010). However, the industry was quick to rebound, with the number of travellers
increasing by 2010, surpassing the 1 billion mark in 2012 (UNWTO, 2014).

Figure 14.10 A crowd gathers at an airport that now serves as a museum

Economic uncertainties for the tourism industry have persisted, however, leading many industry insiders to
Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 339

monitor several economic trends, including collaborative consumption, shifts in emerging economies, and conscious
consumerism.

Collaborative Consumption
Although the phenomenon of collaborative consumption, also known as the sharing economy, began before the global
financial crisis, it gained strength as a result of it. Collaborative consumption is a blend of economy, technology, and a
social movement where access to goods and skills is more important than ownership (Sacks, 2011).
Airbnb was one of the first, and arguably most well known, examples of the tourism sharing marketplace, but several
other companies have joined it, including Zipcar, Uber, and Couchsurfing. According to Nielsen (2014a), more than twothirds of global respondents to a poll are interested in joining this revolution. The impacts on the tourism industry
are still to be determined, although young travellers, budget-conscious families, and tourists seeking authentic local
experiences seem to be drawn to these services (Canadian Tourism Commission, 2014). This is one trend that is likely to
persist for some time into the future.

Emerging Economies
In 2001, a new acronym was introduced into the economic world — BRIC. This refers to the growing economies of Brazil,
Russia, India, and China (Northam, 2014). These turbo-charged emerging economies were growing fast and looking to
be the new powerhouses in global economic circles, even forming political and economic alliances. South Africa joined
the group in 2010 and they became known as the BRICS.
With this growth came travellers looking for new destinations to visit. Outbound tourism development from China has
been especially energetic, with numbers increasing from 58 million in 2010 to almost 100 million in 2013 (Flannery, 2014).
But all has not gone well for these emerging economies and only China has maintained the pace of expansion. Other
countries have since joined the race, creating another new acronym — MINTS — for the countries of Mexico, Indonesia,
Nigeria, Turkey, and South Korea. Time will tell where new tourism growth and opportunities arise in the frenetic global
economy, and who will be the next powerhouse to watch.

Conscious Consumerism
Conscious consumerism, or socially conscious consumer behaviour, is another economic trend with implications for
the tourism industry. This term refers to consumers who are using their purchasing power to shape the world according
to their values and beliefs, leading organizations to project a more ethical or responsible image (Government of Canada,
2012).
This socially and environmentally responsible purchasing by many consumers (Freestone & McGoldrick, 2008) can
direct travellers to more sustainable services and products. Destinations and businesses interested in pursuing this
market need to be acutely aware of social and environmental issues, potentially ranging from organic produce and
animal welfare to human rights (Shaw, Grehan, Shiu, Hassan, & Thomson, 2005). Some of the key principles for
consideration by the tourism industry include an assumption that the traditional industrial model is not working and
needs to be replaced, that awareness of the issues require a different mindset, and that change will come from the
grassroots rather than from above (Pollack, 2012). This is a shift that has profitability and culture change firmly in its
sights (Nielsen, 2014b).
340 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

Cultural and Social Trends
Defining culture as “a way of life” brings us to consider the implications of globalization as a defining influence in how
we live and, therefore, who we are as individuals. Some argue that globalization has created a culture crisis, with values,
beliefs, and identity all made secondary to economic interests and the pervasive and ever-growing nature of technology
in our lives. Below are three cultural trends, followed by two societal trends.

The Tourist Experience as the Good Life
Some people are motivated to travel as a form of escape from the pressures of the globally interconnected
world. Unplugging, where a hotel or resort offers no technological access in the form of Wi-Fi, television, or phones,
is certainly one way to get people to slow down and, perhaps ironically, reconnect with themselves and loved ones.
Biking, walking, small sailboat cruises, rural tourism, as well as the slow food movement are examples of experiences
that simplify life in order to better appreciate and enjoy it.

Travel as a Time to Bond

Figure 14.11 A group of visiting athletes at the 2011 Western Canada Summer Games in Kamloops

Visiting friends and relatives, known in the industry simply as VFR, is a common and important subset of tourism
demand worldwide. With their busy lives, people are seeking a moment, place, and activity to share with family or
friends. In addition to the growing VFR trend is the increasing popularity of group travel, as exemplified in the sports
tourism sector (see Chapter 6 on entertainment) with sports clubs and teams who travel together, and associations that
bring together people with shared interests in cuisine, walking, birdwatching, or other avocations.

Global Migration
Certainly a trend in globalization is the significant movement of people around the world. For British Columbia,
immigrants (35,160) and non-permanent residents (11,949) represented the main source of population growth in 2014,
Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends | 341

along with just over 10,000 people from other provinces (BC Stats 2015). The population of British Columbia as of January
1, 2015, was estimated at 4.6 million of which nearly 25% are a visible minority (BC Stats 2015). The largest groups are
Chinese (10.0%), South Asian (6.4%), Filipino (2.2%), and Korean (1.2%) (British Columbia Ministry of Attorney General,
2008).
Implications for the tourism industry include a growing need to address the challenges of a multicultural workforce,
including preconceptions related to customer service and management. It’s important for diverse teams to be able to
work well together and to communicate well with visitors and guests.

Technology

(right) launches apps for travellers in 2011

For many years, technology has been strongly tied to tourism as the industry has looked to take advantage of
developments and changes, opening destinations and providing new products and services. From the early days of
Thomas Cook’s first recognized tours, offering train rides to the seaside, to the adoption of mobile technology today,
tourism and hospitality has incorporated technological advances into all aspects of the industry. Two key technology
trends affecting tourism and hospitality today and into the foreseeable future are mobile technology and access.

Wireless Ways
Mobile technology and wireless connections affect many aspects of the tourism industry on a global scale. Mobile
technology allows people increased freedom to negotiate their day-to-day lives while staying connected (Dickinson,
Ghali, Cherrett, Speed, Davies, & Norgate, 2014). Online user-generated content, whether through social media (e.g.,
Facebook, Snapchat) or travel-rating sites (e.g., TripAdvisor, Zagat), is shaping where people go, where they stay and eat,
and the types of activities they engage in.
342 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

Smartphones and applications (or apps) provide access to information and the ability for tourists to shape their travel
en route, affecting tourism travel decisions and behaviours in a more fluid way than ever before (Kramer, Modsching,
Hagen, & Gretzel, 2007; Wang, Park, & Fesenmaier, 2011). Travellers can book hotels instantly, searching for the best
deals available. Mobile apps are replacing the hotel concierge by providing up-to-date information, along with maps and
directions, for many of the desired activities at destinations.
Wireless technology has also given rise to location-based advertising, allowing product or service providers to market
themselves when travellers are in the general area (Hopken, Fuchs, Zanker, & Beer, 2010). Attraction alerts and special
offers, often triggered by applications, provoke the user’s attention to elicit an immediate response.
Internet access has become a standard requirement for accommodations, ahead of other amenities such as in-house
restaurants or pools. The importance of mobile technology and applications is expected to increase as travellers become
more independent and less reliant on packaged options (Buhalis & Law, 2008). Proponents of technology suggest that
traditional ways of providing tourism and hospitality information will disappear as mobile technology becomes even
more prevalent (Dickinson et al., 2014).

Advancing Access
Technological advances in transportation are affecting not only how people travel to and within destinations, but
also the impacts that those forms of transportation are having on the environment. Transportation is one of the
largest consumers of fossil fuels, and tourism is one of the biggest contributors to that consumption (Conrady, 2012);
consequently the tourism industry is taking steps to improve sustainability and reduce impacts. For example, newer
planes, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, use less fuel, generate less noise, and produce fewer emissions than previous
models (Boeing, 2015). Efforts are also being made to offer alternatives for tourism transportation (World Economic
Forum, 2011), including increases in the number of electric cars available through rental agencies.
Transportation advances are also opening more access to the world for more people. In adjusted dollars, the cost of
flights per mile has fallen by about 50% in the past 30 years (Thompson, 2013), allowing more people to travel. There are
now even new vehicles for outer space that have created opportunities for people to begin to explore “the last frontier.”
The cost of these flights is still prohibitively expensive for most people (approximately $20 million), but with continued
advances in technology, this futuristic travel could eventually become commonplace.

Conclusion: The View from British Columbia

Figure 14.13 A cruise ship leaving Vancouver harbour for Alaska

Tourism in BC is already being impacted by globalization. The doors of the province have opened to travellers around
the world, but especially from emerging markets such as China. Shifting products and services to meet the needs and
desires of these new visitors will require flexibility and creativity for BC’s tourism industry in the future.
BC has also been impacted by the increase in new destinations, fighting for share of the growing tourism economy.
Social media and other recent innovations in communication will continue to grow in importance for BC to generate
awareness of its many tourism products and services. BC’s many unique cultures and experiences will help keep the
province competitive as long as the industry also recognizes the potential negative impacts that tourism can have.
Recognition of tourism’s importance in BC’s economy, along with supportive legislation and funding, is key to the longterm survival of the industry. At the same time, steps must be taken to prepare for the effects of climate change,
with potentially shorter winters and reductions in precipitation. BC’s tourism industry is already feeling the effects of
collaborative consumption as services such as Airbnb grow in popularity in the province. The spread of technological
advances and improved wireless access will help the industry satisfy this aspect of the market, while also increasing the
means to raise awareness with more potential visitors.
To take advantage of these global opportunities, British Columbia’s tourism industry will have to react quickly to existing
and emerging trends. In the meantime, we hope this textbook will serve as foundation for emerging tourism and
hospitality professionals as they continue to learn about the industry.

Case Study: The Rise of Dark Tourism

A 2014 article in the The Atlantic, “The Rise of Dark Tourism,” profiled the increase in travel to destinations and
cities related to war, famine, disease, or other dark cultural phenomena, often in real time.
The article primarily used examples of travel to war-torn areas of the Middle East. For instance, a tour that
culminates at the Quneitra Viewpoint allows visitors to watch battles of the Syrian civil war in real time. Tour
leaders include a retired Israel Defense Forces colonel who shared that tourists to the area “feel that they are
a part of it. They can go home and tell their friends, ‘I was on the border and I saw a battle'” (Kamin, 2014, ¶ 2).
Other tours travel to the Israeli border town of Sderot, an area on the Gaza Strip under heavy rocket fire.
According to Philip Stone, director of the Institute for Dark Tourism Research at the U.K.’s University of Central
Lancashire, while war tourism is not a new phenomenon, the increased commercialization has marked a new
trend. Dark tourism now has a more sophisticated infrastructure than the days when Thomas Cook took visitors
to see hangings, and the increase in technology and interpersonal communications has caused this area of
tourism to grow at a faster rate (Kamin, 2014).
The article cites media phenomena such as VICE videos (online documentaries) and celebrity chef Anthony
Bourdain’s show Parts Unknown, as well as the growth of the adventure tourism industry, as contributing factors.
They list hyper-extreme tour operators such as War Zone Tours and Wild Frontiers (both in operation since the
1990s) as pioneers of the sector. More recent examples include former journalist Nicholas Wood, who formed

346 | Chapter 14. Back to the Big Picture: Globalization and Trends

Political Tours, a company that takes around a year to plan small-group excursions to political hot spots such as
Libya, to the tune of $7,000 per guest (Kamin, 2014).
In addition to group tours, FIT (fully independent travellers) are creating their own extreme experiences, such
as joining protestors in Kiev’s Independence Square and visiting Tahrir Square in Egypt to witness the election
of Mohammed Morsi (Kamin, 2014).
Travel to North Korea is also a growing market, doubling in size each year with between 6,000 and 7,000 people
making the trip in 2013. Some travellers cite their visits to countries and areas such as these with motivating
them toward becoming journalists and activists. Others state their experiences are therapeutic, helping them to
understand their own difficult experiences or those of others, such as the military service of family members
(Kamin, 2014). According to one of these tourists, “You go to the most extreme place in order to not be alone
with your feelings. You really can’t be anywhere else but there” (Kamin, 2014, ¶ 25).
Refer to the Institute for Dark Tourism Research (http://dark-tourism.org.uk) and answer the following
questions:
1. Would you classify this type of travel as a trend, or a fad?
2. The article seems to imply that dark tourism is an extension of adventure tourism. Do you agree? Why or
why not?
3. How does the concept of authenticity of experience factor into dark tourism?
4. Imagine you are a citizen in a part of the world that is experiencing hardship and this type of tourism is
increasing in your community. How might you feel about it?
5. Imagine you go to a famous battlefield where Canadians had fought and died, such as Vimy Ridge the
World War I battlefield in France. What are the visitor motivations and what is the outcome of the visitor
experience?
6. Would you classify visits to Ground Zero in New York as dark tourism? Why or why not?
7. What are the implications for tourism operators in these areas in terms of risk management and legal
liability?
