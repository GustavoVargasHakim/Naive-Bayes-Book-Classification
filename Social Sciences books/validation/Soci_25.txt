Introduction

Rapid and pervasive changes have taken place in the past decade in providing support services to individuals
who live with intellectual disabilities and mental illness. These services are most often provided by caregivers
employed at specialized community agencies. However, family members and volunteers may also find themselves
in the role of caregiver. Direct support workers are a diverse group in age, education, and previous experience.
This is a large and growing group, yet many organizations have difficulty recruiting and maintaining highly qualified and trained personnel. Few teaching resources are available to those who educate and employ direct support
workers.
In this open access book, we provide practical explanations of what caregivers can do when supporting individuals
with both intellectual disabilities and mental illness (dual diagnosis). Achieving quality services and care depends
critically on understanding client behaviours. This understanding can direct support workers and other caregivers
in developing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to do their job well. Such understanding can promote positive
changes to the overall quality of the environment in which people live, work, and play. An inclusive environment
contributes to the quality of life for people with dual diagnosis.
Our multidisciplinary authoring team draws on expertise from educators in psychiatric nursing, disability studies,
and behavioural analysis. We balance this professional expertise with practical wisdom gleaned from working in
the field and from consultations with over 20 institutions that educate and employ direct support workers. We
provide easy-to-understand explanations of intellectual disabilities and mental illness, and concrete suggestions
for evidence-informed support. Although this resource is geared to professionals and each chapter incorporates
information from current studies to develop a topic area, each topic is summarized in text boxes emphasizing Key
Points for Caregivers. This structure is designed to support a variety of curriculum planning, orientation, and training sessions. For those interested in more background knowledge, we include a comprehensive reference base.
For those interested mainly in what to do for a specific problem, we provide summaries written in plain language.
In Chapter 1, Support Work: The Fundamentals, we introduce the foundational skills needed to work in the field
of disability support. In Chapter 2, What’s in a Name?, we consider use of language associated with intellectual
disability and using “people-first” language. In Chapter 3, An Overview of Mental Illness, we explain indicators associated with disorders of thinking, disorders of mood, and disorders of behaviour. In Chapter 4, Common
Physical Concerns, we present factors that often impact the physical health of individuals with dual diagnosis. In
Chapter 5, When the Problem Is Pain, we provide tools for assessing pain. In Chapter 6, Behaviour That Hurts, we
explore self-injurious and aggressive behaviours. Finally, in Chapter 7, Sexuality, we discuss promoting healthy
sexual expression.

We invite readers to dip into this book to find answers to their questions about why people with dual diagnosis
might be acting in a particular way. We encourage educators and employers to share the suggestions in the Key
Points for Caregivers with learners, either as handouts or other teaching materials. While everything caregivers
need to know cannot be condensed into one resource, we provide foundational information that can make a difference to those who care about and for individuals with intellectual disabilities and mental illness.

CHAPTER 1: SUPPORT WORK: THE FUNDAMENTALS

Core principles
CHERYL CROCKER, PH.D. (REHABILITATION AND COMMUNITY STUDIES)

Introduction
Supporting individuals who have both an intellectual disability and a mental illness is rarely straightforward.
Support work can be carried out by paid direct support workers, family members, or volunteers. Support can be
offered in a variety of different environments including residential, vocational, and recreation and leisure. In all
aspects of support work, fundamental knowledge from the field of disability studies can offer caregivers important
direction. In this chapter, we identify guiding principles for support work, note historical struggles experienced by
individuals with disabilities, and explain competencies expected of direct support workers.

Guiding Principles for Support Work
Four guiding principles are central to supporting people with disabilities. People with disabilities, just like people
who do not have disabilities, have rights related to citizenship, individual control, equality and human rights, and
universal design.
Citizenship means that people with disabilities have the same rights and responsibilities as people without disabilities. Socially constructed barriers, which prevent participation and discriminate against people with disabilities,
must be eliminated.
Individual control signifies that people with disabilities must be involved in all stages of developing disability
services and policies, and in all decision making that affects their lives. This is often missing in the way services
have traditionally been provided, with services directed by professionals and directed to individuals. The shift to
individual-controlled services has been a recent but very successful change.
Equality and human rights are pivotal in shifting approaches to providing service. In some countries, specific
laws have been created to guarantee equal benefit and protection to all people. Laws prohibit discrimination based
3

on disability. In some countries, legislation has been passed to promote employment equity. When employment
equity laws are enforced, individuals cannot be denied employment for reasons related to ability. Employers are
expected to make every reasonable effort to eliminate discrimination and barriers that have adverse impacts on
people with disabilities.
Universal design requires that the environment be designed to be usable by people with various disabilities. Universal design highlights an important distinction between a disability and a handicap. An individual can have a
disability but not experience a handicap. For example, an individual may have a physical disability and use a
wheelchair. A ramp into a building would allow access to the building, removing a barrier that would handicap
the individual with the physical disability. Universal design eliminates environmental barriers that handicap individuals who have a disability.

Guiding Principles for Support Work
Key Points for Caregivers
Guiding principles for support work state that people with disabilities have rights that relate to:
1. Citizenship, through freedom from discrimination
2. Individual control, through involvement in decisions related to their lives
3. Equality and human rights, through the benefits and protection of the law
4. Universal design, through barrier-free environments
“To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity.”
— Nelson Mandela

Historical Struggles
People with disabilities have struggled for acceptance and equality for centuries. Historically, they have been
ostracized. In ancient times, people with disabilities were often viewed as demonic or unique. Few survived and
those who did were not typically part of the mainstream society. In Greek and Roman times, when able-bodied and
able-minded soldiers were needed, people with disabilities were considered “defective” and exterminated. Later,
in the Middle Ages, people with disabilities were positioned as servants or court jesters and fools; some were still
put to death. The primary response to people with disabilities was ridicule for differences in physical appearance
or behaviour.
The Renaissance brought an era of asylum for people with disabilities as the Catholic Church accepted them as
wards of state. Although they were still cared for in isolation and without education, at least humane treatment
was available. The Industrial Revolution introduced broader-based education, recognizing the need for a literate
society and good workers. This vocational emphasis led to the emergence of sheltered workshops for people with
disabilities.

SUPPORT WORK: THE FUNDAMENTALS • 5

The early 1900s introduced a biological emphasis to caregiving, and the primary service model was one of medical and institutional care. People with disabilities were warehoused in large congregate care facilities with a
promise that training and education would be offered.
The mid-1900s shifted emphasis to the environment. Veterans returning from war spurred a rise in litigation and
legislation to protect their rights to rehabilitation and employment. The civil rights movement in the 1950s and
1960s contributed to a much greater understanding of equality and rights, which trickled down to those with disabilities. The debilitating effects of institutionalization were acknowledged. Normalization, now known as social
role valorization, became the widely held belief: that all individuals, regardless of any disability, should have as
normal an education and living arrangement as possible (Wolfensberger, 1983, 2011).
Today, inclusion is the focus for most governments and services. In the United States, Rosa’s Law (2010) has
changed the way an intellectual disability is conceptualized. Rather than the older term mental retardation, the
term intellectual disability is now used. The focus is on providing supports to individuals in the least restrictive
environment possible.
Despite increasing attention to including individuals with disabilities in mainstream society, it would be a mistake
to believe that persons with disabilities are part of their communities. Many still spend much of the day in environments that are not inclusive. All those who provide support to people with disabilities play a key role in discovering, organizing, and supporting them toward physical and social inclusion.

Historical Struggles
Key Points for Caregivers
Historically, people with disabilities were rejected, laughed at, and even put to death. Today, disability
services emphasize the importance of including people with disabilities in communities. Social role valorization encourages communities to provide normal living, education, and employment opportunities
whenever possible. Rosa’s Law requires that the term mental retardation is replaced with the term intellectual disability.

Competencies Expected of Support Workers
What does it take to be informed and competent when supporting someone with a disability? A competency is
an attribute, knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristic that contributes to successful job performance. Competencies give rise to observable and measurable behaviours that contribute to individual success in an organization (e.g., teamwork and cooperation, communication). Direct support workers, regardless of the service that
is provided, require competencies in working with others, assessing strengths and needs, planning and providing
services, linking to resources, advocacy, documenting and report writing, professionalism and ethical behaviour,
and individualizing support requirements.

6 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Working with others is an expectation for direct support workers. The typical approach is to work collaboratively
with others to plan and implement support plans. A multidisciplinary team might include professionals such as
psychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, medical professionals, and social workers. Parents,
guardians, and family members are also integral to the team. Teams promote coordination and communication,
and add to relationships. They may also identify service gaps and raise awareness of strategies, resources, and
approaches that might be of benefit in direct support. Teams are extremely valuable in furthering positive outcomes for clients who are in difficult or complex situations.
Assessing strengths and needs is a significant part of the direct support worker’s job. The approach that is most
favoured first identifies the talents, gifts, and skills of the individual being supported, with a view to using those
to manage any needs the individual might have. An individualized strengths-based assessment then focuses on the
complex interplay of risks and strengths among individual family members, the family as a unit, and the broader
neighbourhood and environment. The individualized strengths-based approach is an overall philosophical view
supported by policies and standards. It refers to practice methods and strategies that identify and draw upon the
strengths of individuals, families, and communities.
Strengths-based practice requires a shift from a deficit approach, which emphasizes problems and pathology, to
a positive approach (Rapp, Saleebey & Sullivan, 2005; Saleebey, 2006). A strengths-based approach values the
capacity, skills, knowledge, connections, and potential in individuals and communities. Focusing on strengths
does not mean ignoring challenges or spinning struggles into strengths. It does require that people work collaboratively.
Planning and providing services follows assessing strengths and needs. Most services have adopted a person-centred process to assist people with disabilities and their families to build their capacities and capabilities. This planning effort is typically a series of discussions or interactions among the person with a disability, his or her family,
and other members of the multidisciplinary team.
The team assists the individual in developing a description that includes a preferred place to live, favourite people
with whom to socialize, and preferred types of daily activities, including preferred jobs. This description is based
on the individual’s strengths, capabilities, preferences, lifestyle, and cultural background. The planning team
decides what needs to be done, by whom, when, and how the individual is to work toward the preferred future.
An individual program plan serves as a record of the decisions made by the planning team. This plan forms the
foundation for the work of the direct service worker.
Linking to resources requires the direct support worker to have comprehensive knowledge of the community in
which the supported individual lives. Community asset mapping is one approach to acquiring this knowledge. The
community asset mapping process (Asset Based Community Development Institute, n.d.) is intended to initiate
full mobilization of a community and its assets around an individual vision. It allows mapping of relationships
with other organizations for funding, referrals, access to resources, joint service planning, or collaborative projects with contributed staff. Once a community’s assets have been identified, the direct support worker is in a good
position to begin linking the assets with the supported individual based on the individual’s strengths and needs.
Advocacy in all its forms seeks to ensure that people, particularly those who are most vulnerable in society, are
able to have their voice heard on issues that are important to them. Advocacy supports and enables people to

SUPPORT WORK: THE FUNDAMENTALS • 7

access information and services, defend and promote their rights and responsibilities, and explore choices and
options (Support Empower Advocate Promote, n.d.).
Documenting and report writing takes many forms. Most common is documenting history and needs, services,
individual outcomes, and service information. Any documenting should be concise, accurate, current, meaningful,
and consistent. Reports can include case notes, plans, assessment results, letters to parents, referrals to other community services, letters to funders, and reports to supervisors, to mention just a few. Documentation serves six
primary functions: assessment and planning, service delivery, continuity and coordination of services, supervision, service evaluation, and accountability. In documentation, caution should be used with personal opinion and
conclusions; defamatory and negative language should be avoided; over-documentation should be avoided; and
the documentation should be directed to a specific audience.
Professionalism and ethical behaviour is a cornerstone for direct support worker practice. Professionalism is the
conduct, aims, or qualities that characterize or mark a profession or professional person. In 1996 in the United
States, the Council for Standards in Human Service Education adopted Ethical Standards for Human Services
Professionals, which are a set of standards of conduct that human service professionals and educators consider in
ethical and professional decision making (National Organization for Human Services, n.d.).
Section 1 of Ethical Standards is targeted to the human services professional and contains 37 statements in five
responsibility areas: client, employer, community and society, colleagues, and the profession. Section 2, incorporating statements 38 to 54, outlines standards for human services educators. The National Organization for Human
Services, a U.S. organization that publishes the standards, has done much to expand professional development
opportunities, enhance communication, promote professional and organizational identity through certification,
and advocate for a social policy agenda both in the United States and in other countries.
In Canada, the Developmental Services Human Resource Strategy is currently working on developing core competencies for direct support workers. With the intent of “positioning employment in the developmental services
sector as a career of choice,” the DSHRS continues to examine models for training and best practice that will
strengthen professionalism among those who work in the field (DSHRS, n.d.). In Ontario, as part of quality assurance measures mandated in the Social Inclusion of Persons with Developmental Disabilities Act, 2008, developmental service agencies now have set standards to guide their policies and procedures (Government of Ontario,
2011).
Individualizing support requirements. Every person is different and may have individual support requirements
that necessitate the support worker having specialized competencies. Often these competencies are specific to the
environment, such as household management, budgeting, health and wellness, food safety, or job coaching. Other
times they are skills that directly respond to individual needs and may include medication administration, crisis
management, and non-violent crisis intervention or behaviour management. All individuals who are being supported will present with strengths, needs, and characteristics that require specialized knowledge.

8 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Competencies Expected of Support Workers
Key Points for Caregivers
Caregivers who support individuals with disabilities, particularly caregivers who are employed as direct
support workers, are expected to be competent and able to work with others to:
1. Assess the strengths and needs of clients
2. Plan and provide services
3. Link to resources
4. Advocate
5. Record information and write reports
6. Demonstrate professional and ethical behaviour
7. Tailor support requirements in relation to unique requirements of clients

Conclusion
This chapter has provided a snapshot of fundamental knowledge that caregivers can build on as they support individuals with disabilities. In the chapters that follow, we extend these fundamentals to explain support that is specific to individuals with both intellectual disabilities and mental illness.
Those who support people with disabilities are in a unique position to ensure that those individuals are included
in their communities. To maximize the possibilities, it is important for caregivers to be guided by principles
grounded in citizenship, individual control, equality and human rights, and universal design. Further, it is important to appreciate the historical struggles endured by people with disabilities. Knowing the competencies expected
of support workers can assist caregivers, particularly those employed in direct support work positions, to develop
and strengthen their skills.

CHAPTER 2: WHAT'S IN A NAME?

The language of intellectual disability
JOHN SIMPSON R.P.N., M.ED. (SPECIAL EDUCATION)

Introduction
In act 2, scene 2 of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, Juliet declares: “What’s in a name? That which we
call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Unfortunately, Juliet’s point of view doesn’t extend to the
world of disability, where names do matter (Wehmeyer, 2013). This is particularly true for the disability previously called mental retardation. The historical record shows that whenever new names have been introduced to
identify and describe this disability, those names have eventually been abandoned because of the stigma they’ve
acquired (Tassé, 2013). Like the names that preceded them, mental retardation and mentally retarded were clinical terms used to describe the presence of intellectual impairment. Like the other terms, they were eventually
absorbed into popular language and used as insults to demean or belittle someone or someone’s behaviour (Special Olympics Inc., 2014). Insults like “What a retard” and “That’s so retarded” are common examples. While
these insults are often aimed at individuals without disabilities, it is important to know that they have been formed
from negative perceptions and attitudes about persons with mental retardation. They suggest that these persons
are somehow defective, not quite human, or less valuable human beings.
In The Cloak of Competence, Robert Edgerton (1967) wrote, “to find oneself regarded as a mental retardate is to
be burdened by a shattering stigma” (p. 205). Edgerton concluded, “persons cannot believe that they are mentally
retarded and still maintain their self-esteem” (p. 207). Although Edgerton’s terminology is now out of date, concern about the effects of stigma on the lives of people with intellectual impairment remains. It continues to be
expressed in the words of those who have been hurt by the messages imbedded in the label mentally retarded and
its common offshoots, retarded and retard:
• “I use to skip school just so I wouldn’t have to hear kids use the R-word in the halls.”
• “Just hearing the R-word hurts, even if you don’t mean it that way.”
• “You may be joking and calling your friend the R-word, but I still hear it.”

10

WHAT’S IN A NAME? • 11

• “When people say the R-word it really hurts my feelings and I feel bad about myself.” (Special Olympics
Inc., n.d.).
Attempts have been made to move away from the negative connotations and stereotypes associated with the terms
mental retardation and mentally retarded. A variety of alternative names have emerged throughout the world and
within individual countries (Ford, Acosta, & Sutcliffe, 2013). The world still struggles, however, to find a common language that is both respectful and effective in its ability to communicate to all stakeholders. Such language
is needed so that proper identification occurs, needed supports are provided, and suitable environmental adjustments are made (Schalock & Luckasson, 2013).
In this chapter, we discuss the evolution of the clinical or official language that has been used to discuss intellectual impairment. We start with a discussion of the purpose of naming and then move to a description of names that
have historically and more recently been applied. Guidelines for choosing an appropriate name are provided along
with information on how intellectual impairment is currently viewed and diagnosed. Throughout the chapter, the
impact of naming or labelling on people with intellectual impairment is discussed, and implications for caregivers
are identified.

The Purpose of Naming
Naming refers to assigning a specific term or label to someone or something. In the field of disability, naming is
the product of a systematic process of investigation known as diagnosis. Assigning a name, term, or label to an
individual or the individual’s disability is a powerful statement that can convey important messages about how
that individual is perceived and valued, and how human relationships will take place (Davis, 2004; Luckasson &
Reeve, 2001; Schalock, 2011).
In the field of disability, correctly identifying and naming the disability that a person experiences is important for
a number of reasons. Naming enables needed services and supports to be deployed and provides the opportunity
to remove physical and social barriers that prevent individuals from expressing their capabilities. Naming also
makes funding available for needed services and supports. On a broader level, naming encourages research and
communication about a particular disability. This can be important to improving conditions experienced by individuals with the disability. On the other hand, the negative connotations and stereotypes associated with names
such as mental retardation and mentally retarded have caused some self-advocates to adopt the motto “Label Jars,
Not People.”

Historical Perspective
Before the 1900s, the word idiot was used throughout much of the world to describe a generally vague class of
individuals who were not considered to be “normal.” Membership in this class was often assigned simply because
individuals were thought to look or walk “funny,” or because they were poorly coordinated. Others were singled
out because they did not speak, were not successful in school, or appeared to not act their age. The first broadly
used term in North America was feeble-minded. The term became common in the early part of the 1900s and was
eventually divided into diagnostic categories, or levels, of feeble-mindedness: moron, imbecile, and idiot. These
approximated the later categories of mild, moderate, and severe/profound mental retardation, and were assigned

12 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

on the basis of IQ score, after the IQ system was developed and popularized in the early 20th century (Walsh,
2002).
By the middle of the 20th century the terminology shifted, with terms such as mental deficiency and mental defective emerging in an attempt to counteract the negative connotations of feeble-minded. Over time, the idea that
individuals were deficient and defective, and by extension not quite good enough, was replaced by the concept of
developmental rate. This term suggested that persons with intellectual impairment were “slow” or developmentally arrested. The term mental retardation was used to represent this position.
In 1961, the American Association on Mental Deficiency (now the American Association on Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities or AAIDD) issued its new diagnostic and classification manual. It replaced the terms
moron, imbecile, and idiot with mild, moderate, severe, and profound mental retardation. The category borderline
mental retardation was also included, and referred to individuals who fell between 15 and 30 IQ points (between
one and two standard deviations) below the average IQ of 100. In 1973, the borderline category was eliminated as
IQ standards changed, so that people with IQs from 70 to 85 were no longer considered to have mental retardation.
This meant that, overnight, the population of people theoretically considered to have mental retardation (at least
on the basis of IQ score alone) decreased from about 16% to 3% of the general population. This reinforced the
understanding that, to a large extent, mental retardation (although under new names) was and remains a socially
constructed entity based on expectations of intellectual functioning. Those expectations can vary from time period
to time period and from society to society, though individuals with significant disability are identifiable across all
time periods and societies.

The Demise of Mental Retardation
Like the clinical labels feeble-minded, idiot, imbecile, moron, and mental defective, the term mentally retarded
was quickly transformed into a common insult. The result was that well before the end of the 20th century, a challenge led by advocacy organizations deemed use of the label as no longer appropriate.
As acceptance weakened for the terms mental retardation and mentally retarded, a variety of terms arose to take
their place. The following are some examples of replacement terms:
• Mental handicap or developmental handicap. While these terms were once popular, labels that include the
word handicap or handicapped have largely been replaced with disability. Disabilities are impairments in
functioning that can be physical or intellectual, or both in combination. Handicaps, on the other hand, are
social or environmental obstacles imposed by society, institutions or individuals on persons with disabilities
(Finkelstein, 1993). For example, the absence of a wheelchair ramp at the entrance to a building imposes a
handicap on individuals who use wheelchairs. Likewise, failure to provide an individual’s usual communication device imposes a handicap by preventing that individual from effectively communicating his or her
needs, wants, thoughts, or interests in social situations. In addition, the word handicap echoes an earlier
time when persons with disabilities were commonly required to beg on the street for survival—to literally
extend their caps in hand for charitable donations (Darrow & White, 1997).
• Developmental disability. The term developmental disability is commonly used in Canada and some other
countries to refer to intellectual impairment. However, in the United States, developmental disability is also
viewed as an umbrella term that includes individuals who have intellectual or physical impairments, or a

WHAT’S IN A NAME? • 13

combination of both, that occur during the developmental period (National Association of Councils on
Developmental Disabilities, 2014). Examples of disabilities that fall under the heading of developmental
disability are epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and autism, as well as intellectual impairment. When the population
characteristics of all people with developmental disabilities are examined, only about one-quarter of them
have an intellectual impairment sufficient to apply the former label mental retardation (Warren, 2000). The
lack of specificity associated with the term developmental disability can lead to confusion when communicating with individuals or groups outside the jurisdictions that use the term.
• Mental disability. In its Vulnerable Persons Living with a Mental Disability Act, the Province of Manitoba
(Manitoba, 2014) uses the term mental disability to refer to persons with intellectual impairment. This is a
term, however, that some people in the mental health field also claim. One problem with this term is that it
can cause confusion between the concepts of mental illness and intellectual impairment.
• Learning disability. In the United Kingdom, the term learning disability is used, having replaced the term
mental subnormality. In North America, however, learning disability refers to persons with specific learning disabilities that do not impede general intellectual functioning. Dyslexia is an example of a specific
learning disability. Many school districts, however, choose to apply a learning disability label to students
with mild intellectual impairment to avoid the stigma associated with the label mental retardation (Warren,
2000).
• Developmental delay. The term developmental delay has been used when discussing intellectual impairment. However, while individuals with intellectual impairment commonly experience developmental
delays, not all individuals with developmental delays experience intellectual impairment.

Guidelines for Choosing the Right Name
The name chosen to represent a disability has crucial implications for individuals to whom that name is applied.
Therefore choose the name, term, or label with deliberate care. In the end, the name given to a disability should
be able to meet the following standards (Luckasson & Reeve, as cited in Schalock & Luckasson, 2013):
• The name should be specific and refer to a single disability. It should allow the disability to be differentiated
from other disabilities.
• The name should possess attributes that permit it to be accepted and used consistently by all stakeholders.
Examples of stakeholders are individuals, families, service and support providers, professional organizations, advocacy groups, academics, researchers, government representatives, and policymakers.
• The name should effectively represent the current state of knowledge and be able to integrate new knowledge as it appears.
• The name should be functional in definition, diagnosis, classification, and planning of supports.
• The name should have the capacity to communicate important values that are held for the named group of
people.

14 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Intellectual Disability
The term intellectual disability is increasingly understood to meet the guidelines above (Schalock, 2011). It is a
term commonly used by the research community and scholarly journals, and increasingly by the larger international community. Countries that have adopted this term include Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Ireland, Israel, the United States, and the Scandinavian countries. In the United States, President George W. Bush
signed an executive order in 2003 that renamed the President’s Committee on Mental Retardation as the President’s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities (Ford, Acosta, & Sutcliffe, 2013). And, in 2010, the
U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives passed Rosa’s Law (S 2781—111th Congress, 2009), changing references in federal legislation from mental retardation and mentally retarded to intellectual disability and individual with intellectual disability.
Advocacy organizations such as The Arc, Inclusion International, and Special Olympics use the term intellectual
disability. The Canadian Association for Community Living and People First of Canada also use this term,
although both intellectual disability and developmental disability are accepted and usage can vary by region.
Community Living Ontario mentions that it adopted the term intellectual disability “largely to conform with growing national and international use of the term” (Community Living Ontario, 2014).
In addition to the countries and organizations just mentioned, the three principal sources for defining and diagnosing intellectual disability already use or will soon use the term intellectual disability. These sources are the 11th
edition of the AAIDD’s diagnostic manual; the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5); and the 11th revision of the World Health Organization’s
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) (Tassé, 2013). The World Health Organization is expected to
adopt the term in 2015. Of particular importance is that the ICD is used by 70% of the world’s clinicians, with a
similar percentage of services and supports receiving funding based on the diagnostic criteria specified in the ICD
(Wehmeyer, 2013). To avoid use of the word disability, the term disorders of intellectual development has also
been discussed.

People with Intellectual Disabilities: Using People-First Language
Advocates, self-advocates, and professional groups generally agree that labels should not act as personal nouns
to represent individuals. For example, statements such as “Rashid is an epileptic” or “Maria is intellectually disabled” should be avoided. Individuals are much more than the disabilities they happen to experience. They are not
defined by their disabilities. Instead, “people-first language” should be used to introduce the presence of disability. Statements such as “Rashid is a young man with (or, who has) epilepsy” or “Maria has Down Syndrome” or
“Maria is a person who lives with intellectual disability” represent people-first language. Unless there is a reason
to do so, mentioning an individual’s disability is not even needed. Consider how you might describe someone who
does not have a disability: for example, “Rani has a very dry sense of humour” or “Ampreet has such a warm and
caring manner” or “Sarah has a mischievous streak.”
This agreement that people-first language should frame conversations about intellectual disability extends to
agreement that possessive language should be avoided when talking about conditions that are associated with
intellectual or other disabilities. This means, for example, that the apostrophe and letter s should be removed when
referring to Down’s syndrome. Down syndrome is, therefore, the terminology of choice (although some self-advo-

WHAT’S IN A NAME? • 15

cates prefer to say that they have Up syndrome). This avoids the paternalism in naming conditions, disorders, and
diseases for the persons who first identified them.

What Is Intellectual Disability?
Intellectual disability affects general learning, so an individual with an intellectual disability can be expected to
take longer to learn and to encounter a lower learning ceiling. How low the learning ceiling is depends on the
severity of disability, exposure to learning opportunities, and availability of supports. While intellectual disability
places limits on an individual’s ability to understand and use new or complex information, the disability is not
presented in isolation from the surrounding environment. Disability and individual functioning then, is “always
an interaction between features of the person and features of the overall context in which the person lives” (World
Health Organization, 2002). Equally important is that each person’s features include strengths as well as limitations and that these strengths can contribute to effective functioning within environments. This has important
implications for the person-centred planning process.
From a diagnostic point of view, the AAIDD states, “Intellectual disability is characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behaviour as expressed in conceptual, social, and practical
skills. This disability originates before age 18” (Schalock et al., 2010, p.1). Intellectual functioning is determined
by IQ testing, with an IQ below 70 to 75 establishing eligibility for a diagnosis of intellectual disability. The fivepoint IQ range is recognition that IQs are not perfect measures, and that a score of 70 on a single IQ test actually
means that the true score is likely plus or minus 5 IQ points, somewhere between 64 and 76. Adaptive behaviour
refers to behaviours or skills that individuals acquire as they grow and develop. These lead to increasing levels of
independence and social responsibility within the individual’s culture and community. These behaviours or skills
are referenced to norms and take into account the expectations of particular societies for individuals at different
ages. In the context of intellectual disability, the presence or absence of limitations in adaptive behaviour is determined by outcomes achieved on adaptive behaviour assessments. Conceptual, social, and practical skills are categories of adaptive behaviour. They include skills in language, reasoning, writing, social judgment, interpersonal
communication, personal and domestic care, money management, and job responsibilities (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013).
In essence, adaptive behaviour is the outward expression of intellectual functioning. As a consequence, diagnosis
of intellectual disability depends on measurable limitations in adaptive behaviour as much as it depends on limitations in IQ outcomes (see Table 2.1). This suggests that there is no reason to apply a label of intellectual disability
to someone if that person is able to function satisfactorily within his or her environment, regardless of IQ score.

16 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Classification
Like people everywhere, people with intellectual disability are not all the same. The range includes individuals
with “few, if any, self-preservation skills who require round-the-clock supports, to individuals who differ very little from the general population” (Walsh, 2002, p. 73). Classification systems are in part recognition that the name
or label intellectual disability is an inadequate description of how the disability is expressed by each individual.
This is reflected in classification categories that differentiate either levels of intellectual disability or intensities of
support needs.
Levels of intellectual disability are specified by two of the three major diagnosis and classification systems, the
DSM-5 and the ICD-10 (soon to be ICD-11). When an individual is diagnosed with intellectual disability, he
or she is assigned a level of mild, moderate, severe, or profound intellectual disability. In contrast, the AAIDD
chooses to assess for support needs across a variety of everyday domains or areas of functioning. Instead of focusing on limitations or individual deficits that are invariably associated with levels of intellectual disability (“He
can’t do that. … he’s severely retarded!”), this shift in thinking takes as its starting point “considerations of what
it will take to enable people to function successfully in typical environments” (Wehmeyer, 2013, p. 124).
Intensities of support needs are classified as intermittent, limited, extensive, and pervasive. For any individual,
these may vary from domain to domain and from time to time, depending on events and circumstances. Intensities
of support needs are described as follows:
• Intermittent. Support is periodic and of short duration. An example is support during lifespan transitions
such as job loss, family member loss, or an acute medical crisis. During the time that it is given, this support
may be of high or low intensity.
• Limited. Support is more consistent but not intense. An example of this support is time-limited employment
training.
• Extensive. Regular support (e.g., daily) is provided in some environments. For example, long-term support
may be required in the home or work environments.
• Pervasive. Intense and constant supports are provided in all environments. These supports have life-sustaining potential, and typically involve more staff members and intrusiveness than extensive or limited supports. Keep in mind, however, that intermittent supports may be high intensity during the time that they are
provided (Luckasson et al., 2002).

The Impact of Names Beyond the Hurt Feelings: Implications for Service and Support
As has been stressed throughout this chapter, the names or labels that we use to talk about people with disabilities
reveal something important about the way society views them. As a result, the names or labels (and the perceptions that underlie them) have an impact on how we interact with persons with disability. For example, when
adults with intellectual disabilities are viewed as “eternal children” and referred to as “kids,” as was the case
within many large, traditional institutional settings, their possibilities become limited by the expectations that we
commonly hold for children. In practice, this has meant that adults with intellectual disabilities have been talked
to in a childlike manner and have been required to participate in child-oriented activities. This means that they are

WHAT’S IN A NAME? • 17

not provided with opportunities to develop and prosper beyond the confines of the restrictive points of views of
others. By implication, people with intellectual disabilities will never achieve the status of a valued adult.
From the point of view of service and support systems, negative impressions and expectations associated with
disability-related names or labels sometimes mean that labelled individuals do not received services that would
be given to non-labelled individuals. For example, an impatient mental health professional may dismiss concerns
of a support provider about a person with intellectual disabilities and a suspected mental health disturbance, with
a comment such as “What do you expect? She’s mentally retarded!” Reiss and colleagues (1982) refer to this
practice as “diagnostic overshadowing”: the tendency to diminish the importance of unexpected or symptomatic
behaviour as merely representative of intellectual disability. This form of stereotyping and prejudice is demeaning. In part, it has contributed to the comparatively poorer health and shorter lifespan experienced by people with
intellectual disabilities. It is important, therefore, for service and support providers to confront their own misconceptions and prejudices, should they exist. Other people’s misconceptions and prejudices might then be corrected
for the well-being of people with intellectual disabilities.
When service and support providers understand the impact of names and language and the attitudes that support
them, they are better equipped to understand appropriate names and language to use, as well as language to avoid.

The Impact of Names Beyond the Hurt Feelings: Implications for Service and
Support
… Language to AVOID
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Avoid describing people with intellectual disabilities as all the same. For example, avoid using the
word the, as in the intellectually disabled, when talking about individuals with intellectual disabilities. This form of description treats people with disabilities as objects and interferes with recognizing
each person’s uniqueness.
2. Avoid referring to individuals as particularly remarkable or interesting because they are people
with intellectual disabilities. Language that sets individuals or groups apart as somehow special or
unusual because of their disability actually reduces their value as human beings. This includes praising someone as “brave” or “courageous,” simply because that person has an impairment.
3. Avoid using language that expresses pity for a person with disability or for their family. For example, avoid comments such as “It’s just so unfair (or “What a shame” or “What a pity” or “How
awful”) that your son has to live with such a disability.”
4. Avoid polite terms or language that is vague and confusing. Though some terms sound sensitive,
such as differently abled or developmentally challenged, those terms only indicate that a disability
exists. They do not actually identify the disability.
5. Avoid using language that labels a person with an intellectual disability as someone who suffers

18 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

from, is a victim of, or is afflicted with the disability. These descriptions give negative suggestions
about the person with the disability.
6. Avoid using language that describes people with intellectual disabilities as having lower status.
For example, by describing people without disabilities as “normal,” individuals with disabilities are
suggested to be “abnormal.” This can suggest that people with disability are not good enough to
belong to the preferred group, normal.

The Impact of Names Beyond the Hurt Feelings: Implications for Service and
Support
… Language To USE
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Use language that is respectful, caring, and kind, and that communicates that the person is valued.
2. Use language that is appropriate to age and culture. For example, when meeting an older adult, a
common custom may be to use a greeting such as “I am pleased to meet you Mr. Dodge. May I call
you Henry?” rather than presuming that Mr. Dodge can be called Henry simply because he has intellectual disability.
3. Use language that is preferred by the person living with the disability. For example, members of
the People First self-advocacy organization in Great Britain prefer to say that they experience learning difficulties instead of saying that they have intellectual disability, or a learning disability.
4. Use the person’s name and discuss issues in the same way that you would discuss issues when
talking with or talking about someone who does not live with intellectual disability.
5. Treat each person as a person first, and with the understanding that using diagnostic labels is
required only rarely and only in highly specific situations.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have discussed the evolution of language used to talk about people with intellectual disabilities.
The value of naming has been described, as have been the negative consequences associated with names that
were historically applied to people with intellectual disabilities. Guidelines for choosing an appropriate name
have been listed, with the term intellectual disability identified as the name or label that has widespread national
and international use and appears to meet standards for selection. The importance of using people-first language
to frame discussion has been emphasized, stressing that the labels and diagnoses assigned to individuals do not
define individuals.

This chapter has included a definition of intellectual disability, along with a description of the criteria used to diagnose intellectual disabilities. The value of classifying disability according to intensities of support needs, rather
than on the basis of level of disability, has been described. Finally, implications for service and support providers
have been discussed from the point of view of the impact that names and language can have on people with intellectual disabilities.

CHAPTER 3: AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS

Common psychiatric disorders
SHERRI MELROSE, PH.D. (NURSING)

Introduction
People who are mentally ill can have considerable difficulty with their thinking, their mood, or their behaviour.
Mental illness is not the same as experiencing normal stress and sadness. One main difference is that mental illness
causes significant distress and impairs functioning, making it difficult to cope with the demands of everyday life
(Canadian Mental Health Association CMHA, n.d; Mental Health Foundation, n.d; Mental Health Foundation of
Australia, n.d; National Alliance on Mental Health, n.d; Public Health Agency of Canada PHAC, n.d.). In other
words, when people are mentally ill, they can’t manage activities of daily living, work effectively, or maintain
relationships. Their overwhelming distress is not just a reaction to daily events, and they are not behaving that
way on purpose. Just like a physical illness, when a mental illness is not recognized and treated, it can worsen and
will last for an unnecessarily long time.
It is not easy to recognize when the distress experienced by a person with an intellectual disability is actually a
symptom of mental illness. The stigma associated with mental illness makes most people reluctant to talk about
their experiences of having strange thoughts or deep sadness. For individuals with intellectual disabilities who
already struggle to find the right words to express themselves, talking about their unusual experiences can be
overwhelming.
When health professionals diagnose psychiatric disorders, they rely on information obtained during interviews
with clients. However, clients with intellectual disabilities may not have the language or memory skills needed to
explain what has been happening. When these clients have had only limited opportunities to socialize with others,
they may be unsure about whether their experiences are “normal” or not. People in their lives may have ignored
their symptoms of mental illness because they believed these symptoms were simply part of the disability.
In this chapter, we describe indicators of mental illness in three key areas: disorders of thinking, disorders of
mood, and disorders of behaviour. Although only qualified clinicians can diagnose psychiatric disorders in individuals with disabilities, all those who care for them can help report the kinds of indicators that could be symp22

AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 23

toms of mental illness. The chapter begins with a brief background of mental health care; identifies key indicators
associated with disorders of thinking, mood, and behaviour; and emphasizes relevant observations that caregivers
must report.

Background of Mental Health Care
History
Until the 17th century, most people who were considered to be insane were viewed as sinful, weak, or possessed
by demons. Cast out of most societies, they were incarcerated in jails or poorhouses. Although asylums or mental
hospitals were eventually created to house people with mental illness, early treatment approaches were crude.
Individuals with intellectual disabilities, traditionally referred to as mentally retarded, were often housed in these
asylums as well. Distinctions between insanity and retardation were not always clear. Those named as mildly
retarded were believed to be worry-free and therefore mentally healthy. Those with the label severely retarded
were believed to be unable to express feelings and therefore not able to experience emotional distress (Werges,
2007). Inmates in the asylums were not viewed as people with an illness; rather, they were considered untreatable
and were punished for any unusual behaviour.
By the early 20th century, mental health care became viewed as a public responsibility, and insane asylums were
replaced by hospitals providing medical care. During the 1950s and 1960s, research led to an increased understanding of mental illness, and specific psychiatric disorders and associated treatments were identified. As it
became clear that psychosocial factors can contribute to mental illness, psychiatric disorders became more normalized, or viewed as conditions that could happen to anyone. However, advances in understanding mental illness
in individuals with intellectual disabilities occurred at a much slower pace. Separate institutions were established
for these individuals and unusual behaviour was still not always considered a symptom of mental illness.
By the 1970s, a movement toward de-institutionalizing people with mental illness began to grow. Admissions to
hospital beds were decreased and community agencies were expected to provide care. Unfortunately, for many
individuals the expected help from community agencies still remains elusive. Today numerous individuals with
mental illness find refuge only in jails and homeless shelters. Those with severe and persistent mental illness
present in general hospital emergency rooms and yet, if admitted at all, may be discharged within days without
having received the help they need. These shorter hospital stays and limited community supports have made it
even more difficult to understand the unique needs of those diagnosed with both intellectual disability and mental
illness (dually diagnosed).

Reversing the Trend
In an effort to reverse the international trend of neglecting health services and care for people who are mentally ill,
the World Health Organization (2013) presented their Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020, calling for governments to find better ways to recognize mental illness and improve treatment. Similarly, the National Institutes of
Mental Health (2008) in the United States, the Mental Health Commission of Canada (2012), the Mental Health
Council of Australia (n.d.), and the government of the United Kingdom (Her Majesty’s Government, 2011) all

24 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

developed strategic plans to improve mental health. It is hoped that these strategic plans will be the start of changing society’s perceptions of mental illness.

Diagnosis
Throughout history, the process of classifying different types of mental illness and finding ways to consistently
explain people’s unusual experiences has taken many forms. Today, psychiatrists and clinicians use two manuals
to classify and diagnose psychiatric disorders. The first is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The DSM was first published in 1952 and
has been revised several times. The DSM-5 is a reference manual that outlines a set of criteria that health professionals can use to provide consistent treatment of mental illness, including symptoms, descriptions, markers, and
treatments of mental disorders.
The second is the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision
(ICD-10, World Health Organization, 2010). This manual uses a system of coding created by the World Health
Organization to track health interventions. More than 40% of people with intellectual disabilities are dually diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (Cooper et al., 2007; Lunsky, Klein-Geltink, & Yates, 2013).
For clinicians to use diagnostic manuals and other assessment tools to accurately diagnose psychiatric disorders,
they need in-depth descriptions of how clients are thinking, what their mood is like, and how they are behaving.
Knowing that people with intellectual disabilities may not be able to provide all the information needed, their caregivers can contribute by sharing relevant observations. In the following sections, we highlight indicators known
to be associated with common psychiatric disorders.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Thinking
Schizophrenia
According to the World Fellowship of Schizophrenia and Allied Disorders (n.d.), schizophrenia strikes 1% of the
world’s population. Individuals with intellectual disabilities are affected by schizophrenia more frequently than
the general population, and they are more likely to be hospitalized for their symptoms (Balogh et al., 2010). Schizophrenia affects people from all walks of life and usually first appears between the ages of 15 and 30. Not everyone will experience the same symptoms, but some symptoms are common to many, such as withdrawing, hearing
voices, talking to oneself, seeing things that are not there, neglecting personal hygiene, and showing low energy.
Schizophrenia refers to a group of severe, disabling psychiatric disorders marked by withdrawal from reality,
illogical thinking, delusions (fixed false beliefs that cannot be changed through reasoning), hallucinations (hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, or feeling touched by things that are not there), and flat affect (lack of observable
expressions of emotions, monotone voice, expressionless face, immobile body).
Distinguishing between positive or hard, and negative or soft, symptoms is particularly important with schizophrenia. Notice that in this context, the word positive is not the same as good. Rather, positive symptoms are psychotic and demonstrate how the individual has lost touch with reality. Positive symptoms are those that do exist
but should not exist, such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking and behaviour. Delusions fall

AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 25

into several categories. An individual with a persecutory delusion may believe he is being tormented, followed,
tricked, or spied on. An individual with a grandiose delusion may believe she has special powers. An individual
with a reference delusion may believe that passages in books, newspapers, television shows, song lyrics, or other
environmental cues are directed to him. In delusions of thought withdrawal or thought insertion, the individual
believes others are reading her mind, her thoughts are being transmitted to others, or outside forces are imposing
their thoughts or impulses on her.
In contrast, negative symptoms are those characteristics that should be there but are lacking. For example, negative symptoms include apathy (lack of interest in people, things, and activities), lack of motivation, blunted affect
(reduced displays of emotion), poverty of speech (brief terse replies to questions that lack content), anhedonia
(lack of interest in activities once enjoyed), and asociality (avoidance of relationships). Keep in mind that the
inability to show emotion associated with a blunted affect does not reflect an inability to feel emotion. Similarly, it
is helpful to understand that withdrawing from others is a coping mechanism for an individual with schizophrenia
and not a rejection of those who initiate contact.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Thinking: Schizophrenia
Key Points for Caregivers
1. With schizophrenia, all those who care for verbal clients must try to know the content of any hallucination or delusion their client is experiencing or has experienced. A typical hallucination might
involve a deep, loud commanding male voice repeatedly telling a client that he or she is “worthless and
must die.” Caregivers are expected to pose a clear question, such as “Are you hearing voices right now?”
when clients are talking to themselves.
2. Caregivers of non-verbal clients must try to determine if hallucinations or delusions are occurring.
Indicators of hallucinations include:
a. Staring to the side and nodding and making hand motions as though listening to a conversation
others do not hear
b. Physically attacking an unseen other person
c. Staring with an angry or frightened expression at strangers or well-liked companions in a situation
that does not require those emotions
d. Covering the eyes or ears as if to protect oneself, when threats are not present
e. Frowning as though something smelled or tasted foul
f. Dressing in protective ways such as wrapping on extra scarves or blankets when the weather does
not require it
3. The nature of schizophrenia prevents the client from understanding that the voices or other hallucinations or delusions are not real. The only treatment that is effective in decreasing the thought changes
in schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. Without medication, trying to orient clients to reality can
bring on profound anxiety and even aggressive actions. Caregivers must know what psychiatric medications have been prescribed.
4. The major side effects of psychiatric medication are a further challenge to treating schizophrenia. Hal-

26 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

lucinations and delusions often include the belief that antipsychotic medication is poison. In response
to this belief, psychotic clients frequently pretend to swallow pills, or cheek. Given this unchangeable
reluctance to swallowing pills, clients often receive long-acting antipsychotic medications intramuscularly during monthly clinic visits. However, caregivers must always watch clients swallow their psychiatric medications.

Psychosis
Traditionally, explanations of psychiatric disorders were introduced as conditions considered either psychotic (not
in touch with reality, such as schizophrenia) or neurotic (in touch with reality but deeply troubled, such as anxiety). However, as research extends knowledge within the field, the experience of psychosis is now understood
to be associated with a number of non-psychiatric conditions. Both children and adults with intellectual disabilities may engage in self-talk and conversations with imaginary friends. These fantasy conversations can appear as
though they are indicators of psychosis such as delusions or hallucinations. When clients are able to indicate some
awareness that these conversations are imaginary, and when clients seem to be directing or controlling them, they
are not considered indicators of psychosis. Psychotic symptoms may be present with clients who are dehydrated,
experiencing seizure disorders, on new medications, or taking street drugs.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Thinking: Psychosis
Key Points for Caregivers
1. With psychosis, determine whether clients know that fantasy conversations are not real.
2. Rule out dehydration, particularly in clients who are elderly.
3. Ask whether the client has been having seizures or has a seizure disorder.
4. Note whether a new medication or new medical condition is present.
5. Document any street drug use, as many drugs induce psychotic-like behaviour.

Dementia
Dementia is not a specific disease; rather, it is a group of symptoms that affect thinking and social abilities enough
to seriously interfere with daily functioning (Mayo Clinic, n.d.). Dementia occurs at a higher rate in people with
intellectual disabilities than it does in the general population (Janicki & Dalton, 2000; Jokien et al., 2013; National
Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices, 2013; Shooshtari et al., 2011). Adults with Down
syndrome are particularly susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease as they approach middle age (Wilkinson & Janicki,
n.d.).
Progressive memory loss that occurs over a period of time is often associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other

AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 27

dementias. However, in clients with intellectual disabilities, indicators may be seen first in symptoms of physical deterioration. Previously mastered skills with daily living may become a problem. Clients may have difficulty
with their sight, hearing, and speech. They may remain inactive for long periods of time. Their gait (the way they
walk) may change. They may lose their sense of balance and fall frequently. Seizures may occur in those previously unaffected. As their condition worsens, clients find it very hard to learn new information. They become
disoriented and no longer recognize caregivers and family. During all stages of dementia, feelings of intense anxiety and fearfulness are common.
When memory loss occurs, most people feel frightened, frustrated, and angry. When they can’t answer a question
they once could, they may confabulate (unintentionally make up) a reply. Keep in mind that confabulating is not
lying and people are not deliberately being deceitful.
Sundowning, or sundown syndrome, is expected in clients with dementia. In this state, clients show increased
agitation, restlessness, and confusion in the late afternoon, evening, and night (Khachiyants et al., 2011). At sundown, clients may become more anxious and disoriented. They may pace, wander, and even become aggressive
and yell or scream as the day comes to a close. Clients can be more difficult to redirect at this time. It is important
to note that dark, quiet rooms may be frightening to sundowning clients.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Thinking: Dementia
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Keep records of changes in behaviour and loss of previous abilities. This is especially important to health care workers diagnosing dementia. Therefore, maintaining clear records of how clients
function throughout their adult life is useful. These records can be formal medical charts obtained
from physicians, or they can be informal records obtained from family members or clients themselves. Scrapbooks, photo albums, video home movies, and audio recordings will illustrate how
clients spoke, moved, and responded when they were well and healthy. Comparing a previous picture, audio, or video with a current cell phone capture of a client can clarify changes that are happening.
2. Record specific examples of physical weakening, particularly in speaking and walking. For
example, identify how a client’s gait (or how they walk) is changing. Keep a record of any falls,
stumbles, or times when clients seem to lose their balance.
3. Prepare for and seek medical help immediately if seizures occur. A seizure in someone previously unaffected and that is not part of a medical condition can indicate dementia.
4. Understand and identify how often confabulation answers are occurring. Confabulation
means making up answers without intending to lie. Knowing that clients with dementia are not
lying or making things up on purpose can help caregivers understand that this behaviour is part of a
psychiatric disorder and not acting-out behaviour.
5. Understand and identify how often sundowning is occurring. Sundowning means increased
agitation in the evening. Clients may seem to be expressing anger by behaviours such as screaming
and yelling, but it is important to understand that this behaviour is likely a response to an intense and

28 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

constant inner fear that clients are unable to escape.
6. Create and communicate supports that help memory lapses. People with dementia are forgetful, get lost, and can have difficulty recognizing friends, family, and staff. Whenever possible, create
cues to help with memory loss, such as calendars of events, photo collections, or scrapbooks. Ensure
that these cues are consistent and that as many people as possible in the client’s life know about
them.

Differentiating between Dementia, Delirium, Dehydration, and Depression
Dementia should not be confused with delirium, dehydration, or depression, even though all these conditions can
leave clients feeling confused. Dementia, as explained above, is a progressive disorder where people become confused over a long period of time. Delirium is a disorder where people become confused quite suddenly and it
can be caused by a medical condition such as an infection. Dehydration is also a condition where people become
confused quite suddenly; it is caused by not taking in enough fluids. Depression, as explained in the following
section, is a mood disorder where deep sadness can make people seem as though they are confused.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Mood
Depression
Depression is a mood disorder where people feel very sad even when things are going well. Mood disorders are
disturbances in the regulation of mood, behaviour, and affect that go beyond the normal ups and downs that most
people experience. Mood refers to a pervading feeling (a feeling that is there all the time) that lasts for more than
two weeks. With depression, a person’s mood becomes so intense that others just cannot help to cheer them up.
Medications, such as antidespressant drugs, are needed to treat depression when it is serious enough to be diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder.
One out of every five people experiences depression during his or her life, and the rate of depression among people with intellectual disabilities is significantly higher (Shooshtari et al., 2011). Many people with mood disorders
have coexisting mental and physical disorders. For example, about half of those with a depressive disorder also
suffer from an anxiety disorder.
Health care providers rely heavily on descriptions of clients’ affect to diagnose depression. Affect refers to the
outward expression of emotion on people’s faces, their bodies, and the way they speak. People cannot usually
control their affect. Even when people who are depressed try to smile, their affect may seem “flat “or without any
real emotion. People who are depressed sometimes have a restricted affect where they do not seem to show any
emotion at all. They may also have an inappropriate affect where the emotions that they show do not match the
content of what they are saying; for example, laughing when describing a loved one’s recent death. Affect can
also be labile (change quickly) with no apparent connection to events in the environment.
Types of depression include major or unipolar depression, dysthymia, and bipolar affective disorder.

AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 29

Major or unipolar depression is a mood disturbance in which the major symptoms—depressed mood and loss of
interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities—occur daily for at least two weeks and severely incapacitate a
person’s usual ability to function. In extreme cases, psychosis can be present in depressive disorders. When people with intellectual disabilities experience major depression, they may try to stay in bed all day, become mute,
eat too little or too much, and refuse to wash or even use the toilet.
Major or unipolar depression can be further described as agitated or retarded. An agitated depression is accompanied by psychomotor agitation such as restlessness, sobbing, and excessive talking. A retarded depression is
accompanied by slowed or absent psychomotor activity.
Depressive disorders can be exogenous or endogenous. Exogenous means that the illness follows a clearly defined
stress such as a death or unexpected change in living arrangements. Endogenous means that no obvious stressors exist. It is important to emphasize that an endogenous major depression is NOT a reaction to loss. A lively
approach by caregivers or others seeking to cheer up clients is ineffective.
Dysthymia is a mood disorder where people do feel sad for most of the day but they can still function, particularly
toward the end of the day. Dysthymia can last for years and often goes unrecognized.
Bipolar affective disorder, formerly known as manic depressive illness, is marked by serious mood swings. Typically, clients experience extreme highs (mania or hypomania) alternating with extreme lows (depression). People
feel normal only in the periods between the highs and lows. For some people, the cycles occur so rapidly that they
hardly ever feel a sense of control over their mood swings.
In the manic phase of their bipolar illness, clients demonstrate grandiosity (feeling grand and better than others),
jocularity (joking more than is appropriate), flight of ideas (rapidly skipping from one idea to the next in conversation), and decreased impulse control. They may go several days without sleeping at all. They may demonstrate
problematic social behaviours such as aggression, property destruction, fecal smearing, stripping off clothing,
and urinating in inappropriate places (McKee et al., 2004). People with intellectual disabilities may demonstrate
grandiosity by believing they can drive a car when they cannot, for example. They may demonstrate decreased
impulse control by spending all their money instead of saving in a planned way. They may engage in risky sexual
activity that results in pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. They can be expected to neglect their needs to
eat well, to sleep adequately, and to care for themselves.

Suicide
Thinking about suicide is common in people who are depressed. Caregivers must always ask if clients have ever
thought about hurting or killing themselves, or otherwise try to assess clients who are or may be depressed. People
who are thinking about killing themselves may engage in risky behaviour, such as walking into traffic with their
eyes closed. They may seem preoccupied with the topics of death, of others who have died, and of funerals. It is
important to ask verbal clients three questions:
1. Have you considered taking your own life?
2. How do you plan to commit suicide?
3. What stops you?

30 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

In clients with little or no ability to express their thoughts of suicide, unusual behaviours may be associated with
a wish to stop unrelenting mental distress by dying. A behaviour may not actually seem potentially lethal, such as
manual self-strangulation. However, when people intend to die and believe what they are doing will cause death,
their attempts to kill themselves must be taken seriously (Byrne, Hurley, and James, 2007)
It is important to emphasize that suicide gestures and attempts are sometimes made when a client appears to be
getting better and caregivers believe that the depression has lifted. However, a brighter and more cheerful affect
may signify the client’s feelings of relief. The client’s feelings about wanting to die may not have changed. In fact,
when people begin to feel their energy returning, they are more able to follow through on their decision to end
their life. Similarly, given that antidepressant medications can be expected to take 7 to 21 days to become fully
effective, they may actually provide clients with the increase in energy needed to act on their suicidal ideas.
A further key consideration is to ensure that any items that might be used for self-harm (razors, knives, pills, belts,
or cords) on a client’s person or in their environment are taken away. Keeping clients who are depressed and suicidal safe requires consistent monitoring. Increased caregiver time, attention, and presence are needed.
Vegetative shift is a term used by mental health professionals to describe problems associated with depressive disorders. A vegetative shift occurs when vegetative signs shift or change. Critical vegetative signs include affect,
energy, pleasure, appetite, sleep, and thoughts of suicide. A memory aid for indicators of vegetative shift is “A E
P A S S.”

• A–an Affect of sadness and poor concentration. Identify sad facial, postural, and emotional
responses that last for weeks at a time and do not seem to fit the context. Sadness in clients may or
may not be a response to something that has happened. Clients may show their depression through
crying, becoming withdrawn and non-responsive, or becoming agitated and verbally and physically
aggressive.
• E–Energy loss and fatigue. Write down the number of times clients are refusing to leave their beds,
take care of activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing, and attend work or leisure activities. Include times when either constipation or incontinence occurs in relation to lacking the energy
to go to the bathroom. Include the number of hours clients spend sitting or lying down for long periods of time just watching TV or doing nothing.
• P–Pleasure or interest. Notice whether clients are no longer taking pleasure in activities they once

AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 31

enjoyed. Notice also when clients with bipolar disorder are cycling into a manic or hyperactive state,
when they may carry out pleasurable activities impulsively. In particular, monitor reckless behaviour
in spending money and sexual activity.
• A–Appetite changes. Appetite can increase or decrease in depressive disorders. Carefully record
client weight and identify any gains or losses. Tantrums at meals, and stealing or hoarding food for
constant nibbling, can reflect a need to soothe the emotional distress of depression. In contrast,
refusing to take the time to eat can reflect the hyperactivity associated with a manic state.
• S–Sleep disturbances. Keep a record of the number of hours clients sleep each night, including the
time they go to bed, the number of times they get up in the night, and the time they wake up. Difficulty falling asleep can be an indicator of anxiety. Waking up early can be an indicator of depression.
Sleeping in late can be a response to dysthymia, where people feel sad in the morning but then feel
better as the day progresses. Remaining in bed and sleeping or dozing for long periods of time during both night and day can be a way of withdrawing that is often associated with depression. In contrast, going to bed late, getting up frequently in the night, and getting out of bed early can indicate a
pattern of hyperactivity associated with a manic state.
• S–Suicidal thinking. Ask verbal clients if they have thought about taking their own life, if they have
a plan to do so, and what (if anything) stops them. Assess if clients seem to speak often about death
when such discussions are out of context. Probe whether the thinking behind self-harming behaviour
is related to an intent to commit suicide. Important: Remove any objects that could be used for
self-harm.

Anxiety
Anxiety disorders are a group of conditions marked by pathological or extreme anxiety or dread. People with anxiety experience disturbances of mood, behaviour, and most systems in the body, making them unable to continue
with everyday activities. Many feel anxious most of the time for no apparent reason.
Anxiety is different from fear. Fear is a response to an event or object that a person is aware of. The psychiatric
disorder of anxiety occurs when the intensity and duration of anxiety does not match the potential for harm or
threat to the affected person. Symptoms of anxiety disorders often include aches and pains throughout the body,
and treating these can distract caregivers from recognizing anxiety as a cause of the physical pain.
People with intellectual disabilities struggle with anxiety more often than the general population. In part, this may
be due to slightly different brain structures, limited expressive language abilities, and difficulty understanding
social situations, which seem unpredictable and scary (Cooray & Bakala, 2005). Anxiety can be expressed with
physical symptoms such as stomach aches, headaches, increased heart rate or pounding heart, feeling startled easily, trembling, sweating, and difficulty swallowing. It can be expressed behaviourally through increased agitation,
crying, repeating comments about feeling afraid, withdrawing, regressing toward more childlike behaviour, clinging to caregivers, and freezing (not being able to move). As intellectually disabled people often depend on or feel
they are dependent on others for their survival, their feelings of constant vulnerability can lead to frequent expressions of anxiety.
Treatment for verbal clients can include cognitive behavioural therapy. Anti-anxiety medications can help both

32 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

verbal and non-verbal clients feel a much-needed sense of peace. However, repeatedly probing to find out what
clients fear may not uncover a threat that others would recognize or believe is harmful. Therefore, finding ways
to offer comfort to clients rather than simply seeking to understand a cause for their anxiety disorder is helpful.
Two disorders commonly suffered by people with intellectual disabilities are post-traumatic stress disorder and
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder in which an overwhelming traumatic event is re-experienced,
causing intense fear, helplessness, horror, and avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma. Nightmares,
insomnia, flashbacks, mistrust, intense psychological distress, and self-medication with substance abuse are common in people with PTSD (Mayo Clinic, n.d.).
People with intellectual disabilities experience PTSD somewhat differently as they may not be able to describe the
event that caused the trauma. Caregivers may not be aware of nightmares that are occurring. The flashbacks and
memories may be vague and distorted and the memories confused. The flashbacks may seem so real that clients
feel they are being traumatized again and again (Byrne, Hurley, & James, 2007). Conversely, flashbacks may be
reported as additional traumatic events, with the result that records become inaccurate and make treatment difficult.
In one study, 75% of participants with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities had experienced at least one traumatic event during their lifespan, putting them at significant risk for PTSD (Martorell et al., 2009). Examples of
traumas that intellectually disabled people face include physical and sexual abuse, loss of a parent, removal of
children, involvement in vehicle or other collisions, and natural catastrophes. Reliving the trauma can result in
acting-out behaviour (aggression or fighting back, inappropriate displays of sexuality, withdrawing in fear) that
cannot be redirected.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Mood: Anxiety
Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Monitor sleeping and identify whether nightmares are occurring. When possible, identify what
the nightmares are about.
2. Record situations when clients seem fearful, particularly when there does not seem to be anything or anyone around who could hurt them. Notice if clients avoid certain situations or individuals
by verbal and non-verbal resistance and behaviours.
3. Provide records of known traumatic events to caregivers and family members. Exchange information about these events to determine whether they are new traumas or flashbacks.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), once thought to be simply a response to anxiety, is now considered a bio-

AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 33

logical condition. Obsessions (the thinking component) are uncontrollable, persistent, and repeated thoughts or
impulses. They frequently revolve around themes of contamination, aggression, orderliness, sex, and religion.
Compulsions (the behaving component) are the actions people take to try and relieve the pressure of the unrelenting obsessions. Compulsions are ritualistic patterns of behaviour often involving excessive cleaning, washing,
counting, repeating, ordering, and arranging, or hoarding and checking. Repeated eye blinking, hair pulling, head
banging, unusual behaviours when urinating or defecating, and self-mutilation are common.
People with OCD do not want to have obsessive thoughts, as those thoughts cause overpowering feelings of pressure and anxiety. They do not want to act on the thoughts either. However, because of the biological nature of the
disorder, people are driven to believe that the only way to relieve the pressure of the obsessions is to keep acting
on the compulsions. When people are in the process of acting on their compulsions, they can become very angry
when their actions are interrupted. In essence, interruptions make the pressure and anxiety feel much worse.
People with intellectual disabilities often respond to interruptions of their ritualistic behaviour with aggressive
retaliation such as hitting, spitting, and biting. They may not know why they must act this way, but they feel better
when they do and desperately distressed when they do not.
In spite of a preoccupation with cleaning-centred behaviours, clients with this disorder may not achieve personal
cleanliness and will present with extreme self-care deficits. Experts suggest that interrupting the behaviour simply
increases the anxiety. With this in mind, caregivers can help by avoiding interrupting. For example, rather than
interrupting a ritual such as repeated hand washing, a caregiver can ensure that hand lotion is available. With this
disorder, the goal is not to prevent ritualistic behaviour, but to delay it.
The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (Anafranil) can have an anti-obsession effect. Side effects of the drug
include a potential for seizures and withdrawal reactions.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Mood: Anxiety
Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Delay rather than interrupt ritualistic behaviours. Expect that clients may respond with
aggression when redirected away from their repetitive behaviours. When caregivers view the behaviours through the eyes of clients, caregivers can acknowledge a client’s belief that these behaviours
are the only possible relief from unbearable anxiety.
2. Prepare for and seek medical help immediately if seizures occur, particularly if clients have,
or have the potential for, seizure disorders and are taking the antidepressant medication
clomipramine (also called Anafranil).
3. Make comfort measures available when ritualistic behaviours result in physical symptoms.
For example, keep available hand lotion for excessive hand washing, and padding or helmets for

34 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

head banging.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Behaviour
Personality Disorders
In the preceding sections, we have discussed psychiatric disorders that include or could include elements of psychosis (not being in touch with reality). Clients diagnosed with a thought disorder such as schizophrenia can be
expected to have psychotic symptoms before they are treated with antipsychotic medications. We now turn our
attention to disorders of behaviour, in which psychotic breaks from reality are not expected.
A personality disorder occurs when personality traits—behaviour patterns that reflect how a person perceives and
relates to others and self—become rigid, maladaptive, and fixed. The disorder primarily affects the way an individual gets along with others. In the general population, people with personality disorders have a great deal of
difficulty getting along with others and functioning well. Their behaviour can be disturbing to those around them.
Often a pattern of repeating the behaviour occurs in different situations, despite efforts to make changes. Personality disorders are believed to be present from a young age, and while medications may be helpful, there are no
antipersonality disorder drugs available as there are antipsychotic and antidepressive drugs.
In the intellectually disabled population, clinicians continue to question whether the same diagnostic criteria for
personality disorders should be used (Alexander & Cooray, 2003; Chester, 2010). In part, this is because people
with intellectual disabilities (especially those who are moderately and severely disabled) can have difficulty getting along with others for a variety of reasons, many of which can be explained in context. Often, caregivers and
family members can support clients toward changing their behaviours, but this is not always possible for people
diagnosed with a personality disorder. Without diagnostic criteria that have been adapted to the unique needs of
the intellectually disabled, clinicians are often reluctant to impose on clients the stigma that can come with this
diagnosis.

Borderline Personality Disorder
Borderline personality disorder is characterized by displays of hostility, emotional dysfunction, mood swings, and
aggression (Wilson, 2001). Clients who have this disorder can overreact to typical requests and events. They can
be verbally aggressive in ways that are very disturbing to victims. This verbal aggression can quickly lead to physical aggression. They frequently engage in self-injuring and suicidal behaviour.
Clients with borderline personality disorder do not seem able to see the connection between their behaviour and
consequences. They may have encounters with the justice system. They tend to view people, circumstances, and
events in their lives as either all good or all bad—a tendency that is referred to as splitting. This tendency can
be destructive in that clients often polarize the people working with them into groups of either “good” or “bad.”
Clients may become overattached to some people and make serious accusations against others. It is critical for
caregivers to avoid siding with clients against other people or caregivers. Let clients know their accusations will

AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 35

be recorded, discussed, and acted on professionally during team meetings. It is important to ensure that communication with these clients does not suggest an alignment of the caregiver and client against any other member of
the team.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Behaviour: Borderline Personality Disorder
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Gather as much information as possible about clients’ patterns of overreacting and behaviour that
is harmful to self or others. Identify if the patterns began occurring at a young age and whether any
elements of the behaviour have changed and improved over time and with support.
2. With borderline personality disorder, consistent communication among caregivers is critically
important. Divisions among caregivers can occur if clients split or view individuals around them
only as all good or all bad.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have discussed the psychiatric disorders of thinking, mood, and behaviour. These disorders
cause so much distress that clients cannot function and enjoy their lives. We have described key indicators of these
disorders and emphasized relevant observations that caregivers must watch for and attend to.
Disorders of thinking include schizophrenia, dementia, and psychosis. Disorders of mood include depression (for
example, major depression or bipolar affective disorder) and anxiety (for example, post-traumatic stress disorder
and obsessive-compulsive disorder). Disorders of behaviour include borderline personality disorder. None of the
indicators that are present with these disorders are displayed on purpose. Just as the nature of physical illnesses
causes people’s minds and bodies to act in certain ways, mental illness does as well. Understanding the links
between difficult behaviours and diagnosed psychiatric disorders can make all the difference in supporting dually
diagnosed clients toward success.

CHAPTER 4: COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS

Factors impacting health
JOHN SIMPSON R.P.N., M.ED. (SPECIAL EDUCATION)

Introduction
The life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities is increasing. This is particularly noticeable for persons
with Down syndrome, for whom the average life expectancy has risen from 26 years in 1983 to 55 years today,
and many now live into their 60s and 70s (Emerson & Baines, 2010; National Association for Down Syndrome,
2012; Ouellette-Kuntz et al., 2004). Severity of disability affects longevity, however, and life expectancy tends to
decrease as the severity of intellectual disability increases. Largely this occurs because people with severe intellectual disabilities experience a greater prevalence of associated health conditions such as severe mobility impairments, seizure disorders, vision and hearing impairments, swallowing difficulties, and inability to independently
feed oneself (Ouellette-Kuntz et al., 2004). Epilepsy, for example, affects 22% to 33% of all people with intellectual disabilities, but increases as the severity of disability increases; half of all people with severe intellectual
disabilities have epilepsy (Royal College of Nursing, 2006). This compares to a prevalence rate of about 0.5% for
the general population.
Individuals with mild intellectual disabilities have an average life expectancy that is near that of the general population. When death does occur, it is commonly due to the same age-related health conditions that take the lives
of members of the general population: cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory conditions, and diabetesrelated complications (Horwitz et al., 2000). Still, while the overall life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities is increasing, it remains about 10 years less than that of the general population. On average, people with
intellectual disabilities have twice as many health conditions as others, and are from three to six times more likely
to die from preventable causes (Department of Health, 2009; Havercamp, Scandlin & Roth, 2004). In fact, in a
review commissioned by Britain’s Department of Health, 90 of 244, or 37%, of the deaths that were reviewed
were found to be avoidable (Heslop et al., 2014).
In this chapter, we discuss the overall health status of people with intellectual disabilities and mental illness as
well as factors that have an impact on health status and lifespan. We describe health and wellness challenges of
39

40 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

particular importance to dually diagnosed people and identify strategies for assisting people who are experiencing specific challenges. The importance of including people with intellectual disabilities in health promotion programs and activities is also discussed.

Health Status
There is broad agreement that people with intellectual disabilities, on the whole, have poorer health, greater health
needs, and shorter lives than the general population. However, evidence shows time and time again that the considerable health needs of people with intellectual disabilities are often under- or undiagnosed, or poorly managed (Balogh et al., 2008; Department of Health, 2001; Emerson, 2011; Emerson & Baines, 2010; Morin et al.,
2012). For example, the proportion of extracted teeth to filled teeth for people with intellectual disabilities has
been reported to be higher than in the general population, indicating that intellectual disability is a risk factor that
increases the likelihood of extraction. When Special Olympics Inc. screened 3,500 of its athletes at the Dublin
World Summer Games, they found that:
• 30% failed hearing tests (this is six times greater than the rate in the general population)
• 35% had obvious signs of tooth decay, while 53% showed clear evidence of gum disease
• 12% reported tooth or mouth pain at the time of examination (in contrast with about 2% of the general population reporting pain at the time of dentist visits)
• 33% required corrective lenses, but only half of them had glasses at the time of examination
• 50% of the athletes had one or more foot diseases or conditions
• All of them (who had an average age of 24.7 years) had high rates of low bone mineral density (increasing
the risk for fractures), comparable to rates reported in women aged 65 and older (Corbin, Malina, & Shepherd, 2005)

Health Status
Key Points for Caregivers
Those who support and care for persons with intellectual disability can get clear signals from findings of
research with Special Olympic athletes.
1. Arrange routine vision and hearing examinations, particularly for age-related deterioration. Adults
with Down syndrome are particularly likely to have vision and hearing problems. Those over the age
of 30 are at increased risk for early development of cataracts, refractive errors such as near- and farsightedness, and degeneration of the cornea.
2. Encourage healthy dietary habits and promote or provide regular daily dental hygiene. Schedule
routine dental appointments for cleaning, examinations, and maintenance of oral health. Individuals
with intellectual disability are much more likely than individuals without disability to report that

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 41

they have not had their teeth cleaned by a dental hygienist within five years, or that they have never
had their teeth cleaned by a dental hygienist.
3. Promote or provide proper foot care, ensuring that cleanliness is maintained, nails are correctly
cut, and clean socks and proper-fitting shoes are worn. It’s been said that to determine how well a
person with disability or dependency needs is being cared for, check the condition of his or her teeth
and toenails. Although this form of assessment is far too simplistic, it does provide a telling measure.
4. Provide well-balanced meals and regular weight-bearing exercise such as walking to promote
overall health and bone maintenance. Individuals with Down syndrome as well as underweight or
small-boned individuals are more at risk of bone loss and osteoporosis. Also at risk are individuals
who experience delayed puberty or early menopause, which can accompany some conditions linked
with intellectual disability.

When surveyed about the condition of their own health, individuals with intellectual disabilities are much more
likely than individuals without intellectual disability to report poor or only fair health, and much less likely to
describe their health as excellent. They indicate that they are more likely than others in the general population to
live an inactive lifestyle and less likely to be physically fit (Campbell, 2001). As a result, people with intellectual
disabilities are also more likely than others to be overweight (or in some cases underweight) and are at increased
risk for illnesses and diseases associated with weight-related conditions. High rates of victimization also place
both children and adults with intellectual disabilities in positions of health and mental health risk. Children with
intellectual disabilities, for instance, are four times more likely to be abused than children without intellectual
disabilities, while women with intellectual disabilities are 50% more likely to be sexually abused than women
without intellectual disability (Horwitz et al., 2000; Sobsey & Doe, 1991).
In all cases, potential health complications associated with specific conditions deserve careful vigilance. For
example, individuals with Down syndrome are more likely than other people to have congenital heart defects,
thyroid disease, leukemia, and Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration. They are also at greater risk for weight and
lifestyle-related problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Because of the high prevalence of associated conditions, Sullivan and colleagues (2006) have argued that patients with intellectual disabilities require
more attention from health care providers than most other patients.

Factors Affecting Health Status
People with intellectual disabilities have associated health conditions that account for some premature mortality.
But a related problem is that they also have less access to adequate health services. This means that the presence
of intellectual disability decreases the likelihood that an individual will receive accessible information and opportunities important to leading a healthy lifestyle. It also means that when the individual is ill, he or she is less
likely than members of the general population to receive treatment, and more likely to receive inadequate or inappropriate treatment, if treatment is provided at all. A report by Britain’s leading advocacy group for people with
intellectual disabilities, Death by Indifference (Mencap, 2007), asserts that disparities in health status and health
service are due to institutional discrimination. From the organization’s perspective, institutional discrimination
occurs when people with intellectual disabilities are not valued in a manner equal to that of other citizens needing

42 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

health services. This factor, along with failure to understand the needs of people with intellectual disabilities and
to adapt service delivery to them means that their health needs are sometimes not met.
Landmark documents from Britain (Valuing People and Valuing People Now, Department of Health, 2001, 2009)
and the United States (Closing the Gap, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2002), among others, agree that health services for people with intellectual disabilities have been inadequate, and they call on health
care professionals to confront their own prejudices and address their own educational needs, where they exist, so
that they are better prepared to provide services equal to those given to the general population. As well, a sizable
body of literature supports the idea that people with intellectual disabilities have been and remain inadequately
served by the health care system. In most cases, disparity in access to adequate health services does not represent
a conscious decision but a long-established or entrenched way of practising. The following factors, separately and
in combination, contribute to the comparatively poor health and generally shorter lifespans experienced by people
with intellectual disabilities.
Lack of health care providers who are willing to provide or interested in providing care and treatment for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Most people with intellectual disabilities have always lived in their home
communities, and de-institutionalization has repatriated the great majority of others who were previously institutionalized. However, some mainstream health care practitioners still don’t see people with intellectual disabilities
as being their responsibility. Instead, people with intellectual disabilities are viewed as being the responsibility of
a specialized system that deals specifically with this population. The result is that some people with intellectual
disabilities are not able to have their health needs met (Mencap, 2004).
Absence of adequate preparation for health care providers. The World Health Survey of 51 countries (World
Health Organization/World Bank Group, 2011) reported that people with disabilities were more than twice as
likely as people without disabilities to describe health care provider skills that were inadequate to meet their needs.
This survey also found that people with disabilities were three times as likely to be denied needed health care.
Surveys have found that few health care practitioners are educated about intellectual disabilities, and many admit
that they have insufficient education to effectively meet the health needs of patients with intellectual disabilities (Mencap, 2004; NHS Scotland, 2004; Ouellette-Kuntz et al., 2004; Reichard & Turnbull III, 2004; U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2002). In one survey of 215 general practitioners, for example, 75%
indicated that they had no training related to treating people with intellectual disabilities (Mencap, 2004). The
resulting lack of confidence and feelings of inadequacy have contributed to practitioners’ reluctance to treat and
care for patients with intellectual disabilities, which is commonly reflected in the following ways:
• Uncertainty about how to interact with patients with intellectual disabilities
• No understanding of illness presentation by individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly in the case
of patients with severe disabilities and limited verbal skills (often experienced as inability to correctly interpret behavioural clues as indicators of illness-related or anxiety-related distress)
• Inadequate understanding of health problems and issues experienced by individuals with complex developmental disabilities and intellectual disability
• Inadequate understanding of methods to adapt to challenges in promoting mutual comfort and effective
communication during examination and treatment processes
• Misconceptions about intellectual disabilities

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 43

• Uncomplimentary attitudes about people with intellectual disabilities
On the other hand, education has been shown to better prepare health care providers to treat and care for patients
with intellectual disabilities. Education is effective in changing misconceptions, challenging and overturning
uncomplimentary attitudes, and producing greater willingness to treat and care for patients with intellectual disabilities (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2002).
The nature of the health care system. Modest fee-for-service rates, along with significant capital expenditures,
operational costs, and high patient volume, interfere with the ability of many primary health care providers to
contribute the time needed to effectively assess and treat patients with intellectual disabilities. Depending on individual characteristics, patients with intellectual disabilities may require longer appointments or a series of shorter
appointments. In some cases, extra orientation and follow-up time may be needed to promote patient comfort,
familiarity with procedures, and general understanding (Reichard & Turnbull III, 2004; Royal College of Nursing, 2006). Unwillingness or inability to accommodate the longer appointments required by many patients with
intellectual disabilities has an impact on the adequacy of health care provision and may discourage contact with
health care providers entirely.
The general unfamiliarity of health care professionals with people with intellectual disabilities can also be problematic. Confusion about laws on consent and the rights of individual patients with intellectual disabilities, along
with absent or inaccurate information about intellectual disabilities, can cause health care providers to make decisions based on faulty assumptions.
The nature of the intellectual disability service and support system. In its World Report on Disability, the World
Health Organization/World Bank Group (2011) reported that many residential and home care workers are poorly
trained and poorly paid. This is commonly the case for those who support people with intellectual disabilities
as it is for those who work in the broader home care service industry. This means that, in many cases, salaried
support providers have limited skills in recognizing and acting on health care problems (Australian Association
of Developmental Disability Medicine Inc. and National and NSW Councils for Intellectual Disability, n.d.). In
places where formalized education does exist, as across much of Canada, the sheer size of the demand for support
providers, along with comparatively poor salaries, means that individuals without formal credentials regularly
give direct support. For these individuals, support provision is often a brief stop before moving on to something
else.
Because high support-staff turnover rates are common within most intellectual disability-related service systems
(exceeding 100% per year in some cases), knowledge about and understanding of supported individuals is often
compromised (Melrose et al., 2013; Royal College of Nursing, 2006). This means that individuals with intellectual
disabilities may not have advocates or surrogates who are sufficiently familiar with their personalities, communication styles, idiosyncrasies, and physical health issues. This also has negative implications for the psychosocial
health of individuals with intellectual disabilities, who have no control over the continuance of significant relationships in their lives.
The service and support system is shifting in emphasis from a medical model to a social or human rights model
that gives attention to inclusion and participation, autonomy, and individual choice. This, however, may make
it more difficult for some support providers to notice and respond to health matters (Royal College of Nursing,
2006). Support providers may also hold prejudices against the health care system, based on their familiarity with

44 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

the troubled historical relationship between the health care system and people with intellectual disabilities. In one
case, support providers in a community residence in the United States refused to give prescribed antidepressant
medications to a person with intellectual disabilities, citing well-known concerns about the overuse of antipsychotic medications with the intellectual disability population. In this case, the distrust of the support providers, at
least in part, may have unwittingly contributed to the person’s suicide some time later (Brown, 1990).
Poor socioeconomic conditions. Intellectual disability occurs across all socioeconomic sectors in all societies.
Although intellectual disability “seems to know no boundaries, it is observed in disproportionately high numbers
in the more vulnerable segments of the population such as the poor, the disenfranchised, and ethnic minorities”
(Beirne-Smith, Ittenbach, & Patton, 2002, p. 208). This imbalance, however, appears to be the case only for people
with intellectual disabilities who have IQs higher than 50; comparatively severe intellectual disabilities is evenly
distributed among socioeconomic divisions (Department of Health, 2001).
While the reasons for the uneven distribution of mild intellectual disabilities are not entirely clear, individuals
with an income below the poverty line are three times more likely to have intellectual disabilities than those who
don’t experience poverty. Though people with intellectual disabilities (and people with disabilities, generally) are
overrepresented in low-income and unemployed sectors, poverty in itself creates a web of conditions that dramatically increases the risk for developmental concerns and ill health (Drew & Hardman, 2004). For example, poverty
means that food and adequate housing are less affordable, if affordable at all. Poor children are more likely to
experience malnutrition and exposure to various environmental contaminants and toxic substances.
In general, disadvantaged social groups are more likely to be poor and at greater risk for illness and disability. In
Canada, for instance, the poverty rate for young children who are Aboriginal, new immigrants, or members of a
visible minority is about twice that of all children (Campaign 2000/2003). In the United States, the rate of poverty
for people who identify as African-American is about three times that of people who are listed as non-Hispanic
White (8% vs. 24.1%; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2003).
While being poor or coming from a minority population increases exposure to conditions that are known to produce illness and disability, these circumstances also place individuals at the core of a complex interaction of factors that increase the risk of illness and disability. Vulnerable people have the additional risk of less access to
essential health and social services as others (Beirne-Smith, Ittenbach, & Patton, 2002). It is a paradox that these
essential health and social services seem to be least available to the people who most need them.
Dependency and limited communication skills. The dependence of people with intellectual disabilities on others
can interfere with their ability to resolve health-related issues and problems. In many cases, primary support
providers must be able to detect and report symptoms of illness that individuals with intellectual disabilities
may not be able to communicate themselves (Horwitz et al., 2000; Nocon, 2006; Ouellette-Kuntz et al., 2004;
Reichard & Turnbull III, 2004). Limited communication skills reduce the chances of identifying and reporting illness early (if reporting occurs at all), and often inhibit or prevent the first-hand descriptions of illness that health
care providers commonly rely on for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
Individuals experiencing illness are inclined to automatically defer to others in perceived authority and the wish to
please others, which can also interfere with accurate diagnosis and treatment of health problems. This inclination
is characterized by the tendency to give the response that the ill person believes the health care provider is seeking,
or the response that the ill person thinks is most likely to gain approval. In this context, health care and support

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 45

providers need to be conscious of asking questions in an understandable manner and avoid leading questions that
suggest a preferred answer. When the accuracy of an ill person’s response is in doubt, it can be helpful to pose the
original question again in another form. If the question requires a yes or no response, asking the same question in
its opposite form can help confirm the accuracy of the original reply (Royal College of Nursing, 2006).
Like many people, individuals with intellectual disabilities may be reluctant to seek medical care because the
diagnostic process, imagined consequences, and anticipated procedures frighten them. This feeling can be compounded by concern about new and unfamiliar surroundings, and by apprehension about interacting with unfamiliar health care providers.

Factors Affecting Health Status
Key Points for Caregivers
People with intellectual disabilities have the right to be as healthy as anyone else. They also have the right
to the same health care access and treatment as others within the general population. Examples of legislation that protect the equality rights of all persons with disability are section 15 of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms, the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, and Britain’s Disability Discrimination
Act. In addition, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a declaration
of commitment to equality rights that has been ratified by 143 countries.

To promote health care access and adequate treatment, those who support and care for people with intellectual
disabilities are encouraged to take responsibility for each of the following activities:
• Maintain ongoing records regarding health status, including changes in weight, eating and elimination
patterns, sleeping patterns, mood, behaviour, illnesses, medications (including effects and side effects),
communication methods, issues related to specific conditions and situations, and any concerns that develop,
along with events that occurred prior to the development of those concerns.
• Act as a resource for health care professionals; for example, ongoing health status records can be shared
during appointments. Formal assessment tools such as the Comprehensive Health Assessment Program
(CHAP) can be used by the health professional and support provider to develop a complete health history
(Lennox et al., 2007). The CHAP is available as a 21-page booklet with two parts. The first part is completed by the support provider in advance of the appointment and provides a health history along with a
description of the issue that prompted the appointment with the health professional. The second part is completed by a general practitioner and involves a review of the health history and then a targeted examination
of the individual. At the end, a health action plan is developed. A feature of the CHAP is that it prompts the
doctor to be aware of health conditions that are commonly missed or poorly managed, as well as health conditions that occur to individuals with specific syndromes. The CHAP booklet can be downloaded from certain CHAP-related websites on request by representatives of support agencies.
• Arrange appointments with health care providers that are long enough to accommodate the person’s
needs. This may include arranging health care appointments during clinic times that are comparatively

46 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

quiet. In some cases, a preliminary visit or visits may need to be scheduled for the support provider to discuss the impending health-related appointment with a cooperating health care provider. Information important to a successful appointment can be discussed, such as the client’s method of communication (verbal or
by signing, computer assistance, pictures, symbols, or other means). Other impactful issues can be discussed, such as the need to provide health-related information in small amounts and to allow sufficient time
for information processing and understanding. In addition, the support provider should obtain a practical
understanding of expectations and procedures that the client will encounter so that the support provider can
adequately prepare the individual for the appointment.
• Explain and/or demonstrate behaviours that will be expected or procedures that will be performed when
at the health care provider’s, to promote understanding and reduce anxiety. This should be done in advance
of an appointment. For some individuals, this may require a desensitization process over a period of days,
weeks, or months. In this case, a task analysis should be developed that breaks down an expectation or procedure into its component parts, so that each part can be taught in succession until the complete expectation
or procedure is understood and tolerated (see Table 4.1).

Common Health Challenges
Constipation
By definition, constipation occurs when a person has two or fewer bowel movements in a week. This is commonly
accompanied by straining during bowel movements or by simply having difficulty with bowel movements (for
example, trying for 10 minutes without success). The inability to completely evacuate the bowels and producing hard or pencil-thin stools are also characteristic of constipation. Support providers should view a swollen
abdomen, abdominal pain, and vomiting as possible indicators of constipation.
Though at one point or another constipation affects nearly everyone, chronic constipation occurs more commonly
in people with intellectual disabilities. Morad and colleagues (2007) found that 8% of more than 2,000 individuals
in Israeli residential facilities were experiencing constipation at the time of their survey, although only about 2%
of the general population is thought to have constipation at any given time.
Constipation is more likely to affect those with severe or profound disabilities, those with mobility restrictions, or
those who are otherwise inactive. In one study, almost 70% of institutionalized persons with severe or profound
intellectual disabilities were experiencing constipation at the time of the study (Bohmer et al., 2001). Neurological
conditions such as cerebral palsy place individuals at greater risk for constipation. It is also more likely to affect
those with inadequate hydration and limited food choices (inadequate dietary fibre and excessive amounts of dairy
products), and those taking long-term medications that produce constipation as an incidental consequence. Examples of these medications are anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines (minor tranquilizers), and antacids containing calcium. In some cases, overreliance on laxatives contributes to constipation becoming chronic. When symptoms are
unrecognized in people with intellectual disabilities, constipation can pose a serious threat to health, including the
possibility of death (Royal College of Nursing, 2006).

Common Health Challenges: Constipation
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Prepare or promote the preparation of well-balanced meals that include adequate sources of fibre
such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grain breads.
2. Encourage adequate fluid intake. Eight glasses of water or other fluids each day can be considered
adequate, unless an individual has fluid intake restrictions or other requirements. Caffeine-containing drinks have a dehydrating effect and milk or dairy-based drinks may be constipating for some
people.
3. Promote or provide regular daily exercise. For individuals in wheelchairs, occasional side-to-side
movement, if possible, or exercise while seated in the chair may be helpful. A physiotherapist may
be able to recommend exercises and activities.
4. Encourage supported individuals to move their bowels when they feel the urge.

48 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Seek medical assistance if:
1. Constipation is experienced for the first time or there has been a change in bowel routine
2. Constipation does not respond to natural remedies such as increased dietary fibre or fluid intake,
or to replacing sedentary activity with regular exercise such as walking or swimming
3. Blood is evident in stool or during bowel movements, or rectally at any other time
4. Unplanned weight loss occurs
5. Pain occurs with bowel movements, or abdominal pain or cramps occur
6. Nausea or vomiting occur
7. Constipation lasts for more than two weeks

Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a common condition in people with intellectual disabilities, with prevalence increasing with the severity of the disabilities. In situations where intellectual disabilities and cerebral palsy coexist, and for individuals
with severe intellectual disability, the prevalence of epilepsy is about 50%. The cause is often complex, and in
50% to 60% of cases the cause is unknown. The same cause may produce both intellectual disability and epilepsy
or, in some cases, epilepsy itself may be responsible for the intellectual disability. In any case, epilepsy contributes
to the morbidity and mortality profiles of many people with intellectual disabilities and represents a condition
requiring careful observation (Royal College of Nursing, 2006; Santos-Teachout et al., 2007).
By definition, epilepsy is characterized by sudden, brief changes in the brain’s electrical activity. It is a symptom
of a neurological disorder and is expressed in the form of seizures (Epilepsy Canada, n.d.). Seizures can be
generalized or partial, depending on the extent of brain involvement. If there is extensive activity affecting the
entire brain, then seizures are generalized. If the activity is localized in a specific area of the brain, the seizure is
considered partial. A single seizure does not constitute epilepsy, nor do seizures associated with conditions that
may cause event-specific seizure activity, such as illness with an accompanying fever in young children (febrile
seizures). An actual diagnosis of epilepsy depends on an observable pattern of seizure activity along with confirming results from specific diagnostic testing.
Events that may trigger seizures (Epilepsy Canada, n.d.) include:
• Stress
• Poor nutrition
• Missed medication
• Flickering lights
• Skipping meals
• Illness, fever, and allergies
• Lack of sleep

• Emotions such as anger, worry, and fear

Whether generalized or partial, epileptic seizures can take a number of different forms. The most common form
or type of epileptic seizure is the complex partial seizure, which accounts for 40% of all seizures. These seizures
are often preceded by an aura, which is a strange sensation such as an odd smell, strange taste, tingling sensation,
unusual sound, or a sense of uneasiness or dread. An aura is actually a simple partial seizure, and may be the only
form of an individual’s seizure activity; this is the case in 20% of seizures. In the case of complex partial seizures,
however, an aura may signal that a seizure is about to take place. An individual who then experiences a complex
partial seizure may appear dazed and confused and may engage in random walking, mumbling, head turning, and
pulling at his or her clothes. There is a change in the individual’s level of consciousness (the individual is not fully
conscious, nor is he or she unconscious), with the seizure itself lasting from 30 seconds to three minutes.
Tonic–clonic seizures (previously called grand mal seizures) are generalized, and are the kind of seizure that commonly comes to mind when epilepsy is mentioned, though they only account for 20% of all seizures. The characteristic pattern of tonic–clonic seizures may or may not include an aura. When an aura is present, it provides a
warning that may permit the individual time to lie down on the floor or may allow someone nearby to assist the
individual to the floor before he or she becomes unconscious and otherwise falls. The aura may be accompanied
by a cry that also serves a warning that a seizure is about to take place.
Normally, a tonic–clonic seizure lasts from one to a few minutes and has two distinct phases. The tonic phase is
characterized by stiffening of the body and is followed by the clonic phase, characterized by energy release in
the form of rhythmic jerking of the extremities, otherwise called a convulsion. In the tonic phase, breathing may
appear to be suspended (lips may turn blue). During the seizure, the individual may drool and may lose bladder
and/or bowel control. After the clonic phase and then recovery, breathing may appear to be stertorous or audible, much like snoring. While the individual may bite his or her tongue, at no time should a support provider try
to insert anything into the individual’s mouth. During the tonic phase the jaw is tightly clenched, and during the
clonic phase teeth commonly chatter. Attempting to insert an object such as a spoon into the individual’s mouth
to compress the tongue at any point during a seizure may cause injury. Contrary to the once popular myth, people
cannot swallow their tongue. Once a seizure has run its course, the individual is typically confused, tired, and may
have a headache. He or she will have no memory of the seizure and will require time to rest.
When assisting individuals experiencing tonic–clonic seizures:
• Stay calm.
• If possible, assist the person to the ground.
• Protect the person from injury by removing nearby obstacles that he or she may bang up against.
• Do not restrain the person.
• Do not insert anything into the person’s mouth.
• Time the duration of the seizure.
• Call for medical assistance if the seizure lasts for five minutes or more.
• Once the seizure is over, place the person in the recovery position (on his or her left side) and allow him or

50 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

her to rest, checking back periodically.
• Reassure and reorient the person when he or she has recovered.
Absence seizures (previously called petit mal seizures) are very brief, lasting for a matter of seconds. They occur
more often to children than to adults, and when they occur, the individual gives the impression of daydreaming,
momentary inattention, or staring. Because of their brief nature, others who may be with individuals experiencing
these seizures may not notice the seizure activity.
Other types of epileptic seizures are myoclonic, involving a single or repetitive jerking of muscles without a loss of
consciousness, and atonic, also called akinetic or drop seizures. In atonic seizures, loss of muscle tonicity occurs
and the individual is unable to sit or stand; if standing, the individual will fall to the ground without a loss of consciousness. Like tonic–clonic seizures, atonic seizures create a risk for injury.
Seizures that last for more than five minutes tend not to resolve without medical intervention. Therefore, seizures
that last for five minutes or longer, or two or more seizures that occur in succession without intervening periods
of recovery or return to normal functioning, should be considered a medical emergency. This condition is known
as status epilepticus (Brophy et al., 2012). Status epilepticus can occur in cases of non-convulsive as well as convulsive epilepsy. In all such cases, an ambulance should be called.

Common Health Challenges: Epilepsy
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Be conscious of situations and conditions that are likely to trigger seizures for supported individuals. Avoid or reduce exposure to triggers whenever possible.
2. Provide appropriate assistance to the individual if a seizure does occur.
3. After a seizure, record the conditions under which the seizure occurred, along with a description
of the seizure activity. Describe how long the seizure lasted and emergency measures if needed.
Describe any events that accompanied the seizure, such as loss of bladder control or injury. Describe
the nature of the recovery after the seizure.

Respiratory Disease
Though the vast majority of individuals with intellectual disabilities live in community settings, existing institutions characteristically house a disproportionate number of individuals with severe and profound intellectual
disabilities. Difficulties with movement, independent mobility, and swallowing are especially high within this
population. As a result, and because of the risks inherent in community living, institutionalized individuals (and
individuals in other community situations) are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections through transmission of infectious agents, aspiration (breathing food or liquid into the lungs), and reflux (see discussion on gas-

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 51

trointestinal problems). Almost half the deaths that occur in institutions are attributed to the respiratory illnesses
pneumonia and influenza.
Individuals with Down syndrome are also at particular risk for respiratory infections. These individuals tend to
breathe through the mouth and have physical malformations that can interfere with sinus drainage, and a poor
immune system that makes them susceptible to infections (Horwitz et al., 2000; Royal College of Nursing, 2006).

Cancer
The rate of gastrointestinal cancer in individuals with intellectual disabilities is about twice the rate as that
observed in the general population. This may be due to gastrointestinal reflux (see discussion on gastrointestinal
problems) and chronic constipation that are comparatively common in individuals with severe and complex disabilities living in community settings. Individuals with Down syndrome are at risk for a particular form of cancer
called lymphoblastic leukemia (Horwitz et al., 2000).

Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease accounts for as much as 50% of deaths among people with intellectual disabilities, depending on the population reviewed. Because of lifestyle factors that more closely resemble those of the general population, individuals with mild intellectual disabilities (about 85% of people with intellectual disabilities) are more
vulnerable than individuals with more severe disabilities.
Congenital heart defects affect 30% to 60% of children with Down syndrome, regardless of severity. Congenital
heart defects are also common in children with Williams syndrome. With advances in medical technology, however, survival rates have improved dramatically over the years. Vigilance remains important for at-risk populations, with electrocardiogram and echocardiogram screenings recommended for infants with Williams or Down
syndrome (Horwitz et al., 2000).

Diabetes
The likelihood of developing diabetes appears to be greater for people with intellectual disabilities than for the
general population. This seems to be the case even more for people with Down syndrome, who appear to have
a greater likelihood of developing the disease at an earlier age (Horwitz et al., 2000; Royal College of Nursing,
2006).

Gastrointestinal Problems
Comparatively high rates of helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection are found in people with intellectual disabilities who are in community living situations or who attend day centres or vocational workshops. H. pylori is a
bacterium that usually infects the stomach and, along with reflux and chronic constipation, is viewed as a predisposing factor for the greater occurrence of gastric cancer observed in people with intellectual disabilities (Royal
College of Nursing, 2006).
Gastroesophageal reflux disease and reflux esophagitis occur frequently in individuals with severe or profound

52 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

intellectual disabilities. These are chronic conditions caused by stomach acid entering the esophagus. Their prevalence in people living in institutions is high. Individuals with Fragile X syndrome also have particular vulnerability, as do individuals with scoliosis, cerebral palsy, and those taking anticonvulsant medications or other
benzodiazepines. Though easily treated, gastroesophageal reflux disease is often unnoticed in individuals with
intellectual disabilities, which may be why they have a higher rate of esophageal and gastrointestinal cancer. Vomiting (along with blood in the vomit), effortless regurgitation of meals after eating, and depressive symptoms,
should raise clinical suspicions (Santos-Teachout et al., 2007).

Sensory Impairments
The available data show that as many as 72% of all children with intellectual disability have ophthalmological
problems (compared with 25% in the general population). Common vision impairments are refractive errors, strabismus (the muscles of the eyes not well coordinated and the eyes not lining up in the same direction), cataracts
(clouding of the lens of the eye), keratoconus (thinning cornea and bulging outward in a cone shape, causing
blurred vision), nystagmus (repetitive, uncontrolled movements of the eye that can result in poor vision), and poor
visual acuity (Royal College of Nursing, 2006). Individuals with severe intellectual disabilities are more likely
to have visual impairments than individuals with mild intellectual disabilities. They are also more likely to have
hearing problems, with about 40% of individuals with severe disabilities believed to have hearing impairments
(Santos-Teachout et al., 2007).
People with intellectual disabilities tend to experience vision and hearing deterioration earlier than the general
people. In addition, some causes of intellectual disabilities, or their co-occurring conditions, also produce sensory
impairments. Cerebral palsy, Fragile X syndrome, and fetal rubella syndrome are associated with such impairments. Adults with Down syndrome who are over the age of 30 are predisposed to develop premature age-related
cataracts, refractive errors, and degenerative corneal problems. They are also at risk for early age-related hearing
loss. On the whole, deafness is comparatively common in people with intellectual disabilities, but it is frequently
unrecognized or poorly managed (Horwitz et al., 2000).

Obesity
Although obesity, generally, is on the rise in North America, obesity levels in people with intellectual disabilities
remain higher than in the general population (Horwitz et al., 2000; Rimmer & Yamaki, 2006). Adults with mild
intellectual disabilities, especially women, are most vulnerable. Individuals with comparatively severe intellectual disabilities are less likely to be overweight or obese, likely because of the greater menu control maintained
by support providers. Therefore, risk of obesity decreases as the severity of disability increases (Stancliffe et al.,
2011).
Living situations and the cause of the disability are also factors and have a noticeable impact on obesity prevalence. Individuals with intellectual disabilities who live at home or on their own, for instance, have a higher rate of
obesity than those in community living situations. Individuals who live their own are more likely to have unbalanced meals and rely on convenience foods (Horwitz et al., 2000; Royal College of Nursing, 2006).
Some genetic conditions or chromosomal irregularities that cause intellectual disability are associated with
weight-related problems. For example, Down syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome are correlated with weight gain

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 53

or obesity (a primary feature of Prader-Willi syndrome is compulsive overeating). Other factors that create risk
for obesity and its inherent dangers are:
• The tendency to be physically inactive (In a survey of 1,500 people with intellectual disability in 14 European countries, more than 50% of individuals reported sedentary leisure time activities such as TV watching
or reading [Walsh, Kerr, & van Schrojenstein Lantman-Devalk, 2003].)
• Dependence on others to create opportunities for physical activity
• Lack of access to or difficulty understanding health promotion materials and campaigns that encourage
healthy lifestyles
• Greater likelihood (compared with the general population) of being on medications such as anticonvulsants or antipsychotics that have weight gain as a side effect (Horwitz et al., 2000; van Schrojenstein Lantman-De Valk, Metsemakers, Haveman, & Crebolder, 2000)
Some individuals with intellectual disabilities are at comparatively greater risk for being underweight. This is the
case for individuals with metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria (PKU), in which certain nutrients cannot be
effectively broken down and used by the body, and for individuals with swallowing or feeding problems that can
be attributed to severe neurological damage (Royal College of Nursing, 2006). An additional concern for individuals with swallowing or feeding problems is the potential for choking and for aspiration. In this case, the principal
caution is that those who assist with feeding must understand proper techniques to lessen the risk for choking and
aspiration.
Where weight-related or swallowing/feeding-related concerns exist, appropriate health care providers should be
consulted. For instance, a nutritionist can develop a weight management program for individuals whose weight
presents a health concern. Similarly, an occupational therapist can provide instruction about how to correctly assist
individuals who have swallowing or feeding challenges, as may be the case with individuals who have severe
forms of cerebral palsy. For example, the therapist will be able to demonstrate alternative techniques to the dangerous practice of “bird feeding” (feeding an individual with his or her neck extended and increasing the risk of
aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs).

Medication Use
In its survey of 14 European countries, the Pomona Project found that 65% of people with intellectual disabilities
used one or more medications (Walsh et al., 2003). About 50% used nervous-system-related medications, principally anti-epileptics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. High rates of polypharmacy, or use of multiple medications, mean that individuals with intellectual disabilities are more susceptible to drug interactions than is
the general population. Such interactions may produce, among other possibilities, sedation, confusion, constipation, balance difficulties and falls, incontinence, weight gain, impairments in epilepsy management, metabolic
effects, and movement-related disorders (Ouellette-Kuntz et al., 2004). Therefore, support providers and health
care providers must understand the effects and side effects of medications used by clients and patients with intellectual disabilities, and the extent to which those clients and patients experience them.
The use of antipsychotic medications with people with intellectual disabilities has been controversial and is often
high in long-stay institutions. Emerson and Baines (2010) report use by almost 45% of institutionalized people in

54 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

the United Kingdom. Use diminishes to 20% to 30% in community-based residences, and to around 10% in family homes. Individuals who are most likely to receive antipsychotic medications are those who reside in congregate living situations, are mobile, and are overweight. Antipsychotics cause weight gain, however, so it is unclear
whether weight is a factor that influences prescription or a feature of prescription usage. Antipsychotic medication
use also appears more prevalent in situations where nurses are the main support providers.
Antipsychotic medications are meant for a specific purpose: to treat individuals who are or at risk of psychosis,
like that experienced by people who live with schizophrenia. For the most part, however, antipsychotics are prescribed as a mechanism to manage challenging behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities. This has occurred
and continues to occur in some circumstances “despite no evidence for their effectiveness in treating challenging
behaviours and considerable evidence of harmful side effects” (Emerson & Baines, 2010, p. 10).
The challenge for support providers is to apply appropriate assessment approaches to better understand and
respond to challenging behaviours when they exist. This may include consulting behaviour specialists. Support
providers must keep in mind that behaviour occurs in a context that includes both an individual’s internal experience and external or environmental conditions. This means that components of the physical and social environments also need to be considered when trying to understand why challenging behaviours occur.

Mistreatment
There is widespread agreement that the prevalence of abuse in children and adults with intellectual disabilities is
greater than in the general population. Unfortunately, abuse often comes from the hands of those who are assigned
to provide care, support, and protection.
Though abuse of individuals with intellectual disabilities is no longer an accepted standard (as it was through
much of history), it nonetheless continues to occupy a place in the dark corners of the disability world. In one
study, Waldman, Swerdloff, & Perlman (1999) found that children who are abused are four times more likely
to have intellectual disabilities than non-abused children. In another study, Verdugo, Bermejo & Fuentes (1995)
found that 11.5% of children with intellectual disabilities had some evidence of mistreatment by age 19, compared with 1.5% of children without intellectual disabilities. In a more general study, Crosse, Kayey, & Ratnofsky
(1993) found that children with disabilities are almost two times more likely to be sexually abused than children
without disabilities. Though mistreatment is likely the result of a convergence of multiple factors, factors that
appear to place individuals with intellectual disability at greater risk are:
• The view that people with intellectual disabilities are “less human” and therefore less valuable (or simply
that they are lesser valued human beings)
• Physical and social isolation/segregation or marginalization, and the societal perception of differentness
• Lack of personal empowerment or ability/opportunity to influence others or circumstances
• Dependence on caregivers and support providers
• Learned compliance—people with intellectual disability are characteristically expected to do as they are
told, to acquiesce to the requests, demands, and commands of others
• Physical defencelessness—people with intellectual disabilities who are dependent on others often have no
recourse to defend themselves, to run, or to make other choices that will reduce the likelihood of mistreat-

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 55

ment
• Limited opportunities to develop social skills and resources needed to prevent or escape mistreatment
• Unwillingness by others to believe information from the mistreated person with disability or unwillingness
to act on news of mistreatment—cultures of silence and inaction can develop among support and health care
providers that function to tacitly approve and maintain mistreatment of vulnerable persons
• Limited communication skills—the individual with intellectual disabilities may not be able to speak or may
have very limited word skills
• The inability of the individual with intellectual disabilities to differentiate between normal and unacceptable
behaviour by others—individuals with intellectual disabilities are at risk for exploitation and sexual abuse
because of limited or absent sex education, for example
• Limited cognitive abilities, increasing risk for mistreatment by people who misinterpret lack of understanding for non-compliance, and by people who are impatient or who see little personal risk in mistreating people who are at a cognitive disadvantage
• Behavioural challenges or overly compliant behaviour by the person with disability
• Stressful working or living conditions with limited resources and supports—for example, health care professionals or support providers responsible for supervising an unreasonably large number of individuals,
workers not sufficiently prepared or supported to help individuals with challenges, or a socially isolated
parent who is unable to cope with the 24-hour requirements of his or her son or daughter
• Absence of exemplary role models—when capable and caring colleagues, managers, family members, or
friends are absent, inappropriate behavioural responses are more likely to be accepted and normalized
within a specific environment
• Insufficient education and lack of supervised practice and feedback
• Lack of effective and enforced policies and procedures. Abusive behaviour is more likely to occur in workplace environments where there are no formalized expectations, requirements, or guidelines that support
appropriate behaviour and deter inappropriate or abusive behaviour. Abusive behaviour is also more likely
to occur in environments with appropriate policies and procedures when compliance with those policies and
procedures is not effectively monitored and enforced (Manitoba Family Services and Housing, 2000).

Common Health Challenges: Mistreatment
Key Points for Caregivers
The foundation to providing appropriate support is respect for the right of individuals with intellectual
disability to make informed choices and decisions about their own lives. Informed choices and decisions
mean that people make their decisions based on a full and adequate understanding of all available options
and their possible consequences. For supported persons with intellectual disability, it also means that they
are able to discuss choices with people who are important to the decision and who genuinely have the best
interests of the supported person in mind. When more severe disability exists, others must make decisions

56 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

based on how they understand the supported person’s wishes and values, still in the genuine best interests
of that person.

Down Syndrome
Down syndrome occurs because of a chromosomal irregularity in human chromosome 21 (chromosomes contain
genes). In the vast majority of cases, Down syndrome occurs spontaneously, rather than by inheritance. Overall,
the incidence of Down syndrome is about one in every 700 to 1,000 live births, with the rate increasing to about
one in 35 by the time the mother reaches age 45. Because most children are born to younger women, however,
80% of all Down syndrome children are born to women below the age of 35. In about 5% of cases, Down syndrome originates in the father, with paternal age past 50 to 55 believed to be a factor.
Although the reasons are not fully understood, people with Down syndrome experience accelerated aging
(National Down Syndrome Society, 2012). It seems likely, however, that accelerated aging is largely due to genes
on chromosome 21 that are related to the aging process. According to Moran and colleagues (2013), “the experience of accelerated aging can be seen medically, physically and functionally” (p. 4). Family members and support
providers often report that individuals with Down syndrome just seem to slow down in their late 40s and 50s.
Support workers should be conscious of and prepared for aging-related issues that commonly affect individuals
with Down syndrome before most other people. One major aging-related issue is the potential development of
early onset Alzheimer disease. Like the aging process, this disease has a gene located on chromosome 21, causing
individuals with Down syndrome to be susceptible to the disease.
Whether age-related or otherwise, certain health conditions are especially common among individuals with Down
syndrome. The following deserve the attention of support providers and health care professionals:
• Atlantoaxial instability (AI). AI occurs in 10% to 40% of individuals with Down syndrome and involves a
looseness of movement at the point where the first and second cervical vertebrae meet. This creates risk for
spinal cord injury. Some experts believe that this risk necessitates curtailment of contact sports for individuals with AI. Screening for non-symptomatic AI is an important consideration for health care professionals.
• Congenital heart defects. While only 0.8% of children in the general population have congenital heart
defects, 30% to 60% of children with Down syndrome are born with heart defects (Forster-Gibson & Berg,
2011).
• Thyroid disease. Individuals with Down syndrome have a greater prevalence of thyroid disorders and are
more likely to contract thyroid disorders at an earlier age than the general population, with 15% to 50%
being hypothyroid (Forster-Gibson & Berg, 2011).
• Osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis, or brittle bones, in the population of individuals with Down
syndrome is uncommonly high. In addition to Down syndrome itself, accompanying features (where they
occur) such as small body size, delayed puberty, early onset menopause, and hypogonadism (undersized
testes) are contributing factors in the development of osteoporosis.
• Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease or Alzheimer-like neuropathology has a sweeping effect on the
Down syndrome population, with as many as 50% of individuals affected by the age of 60. As mentioned,

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 57

a genetic marker for Alzheimer disease is found on chromosome 21, meaning that people with Down syndrome are predisposed to Alzheimer disease.
• Leukemia. Childhood leukemia affects about 1% of individuals with Down syndrome. The risk for
leukemia is 15 to 20 times greater than for individuals in the general population.
• Dental problems. Children and adults with Down syndrome commonly experience a variety of dental problems: delayed eruption of teeth, atypical sequence of eruption, missing teeth, enamel deficiencies, bruxism
(teeth grinding), and periodontal (gum) disease. This suggests the importance of professional dental and
periodontal care.
• Vision problems. Refractive errors are prevalent in individuals with Down syndrome, as are strabismus and
nystagmus. Regular vision screening and optometric/ophthalmologic care is indicated.
• Other health problems. Drainage problems of the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear to
the back of the nose) and sinuses, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), gastroesophageal reflux, and seizure
disorders are overrepresented in individuals with Down syndrome (Horwitz et al., 2000; Moran et al.,
2013).
While Down syndrome is commonly accompanied by a variety of challenging medical complications, the advent
of antibiotics and advances in medical procedures mean that many physical problems can be corrected or effectively treated. Because of these advances, the life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome has improved
dramatically.

Older People with Intellectual Disabilities
Like everyone else, people with intellectual disabilities experience health problems that are related to aging. However, older people with intellectual disabilities have higher rates of respiratory disorders, arthritis, hypertension,
urinary incontinence, immobility, hearing impairment, and cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). Though the signs
and symptoms of dementia are the same as those experienced by people without intellectual disabilities, dementia
tends to be recognized later if it occurs. This may be due to support providers and health professionals confusing
signs and symptoms of dementia with intellectual disabilities. It may also be due to the capacity of highly structured and routine environments, like those in community living situations, to mask emerging difficulties.
Note: Dementia is an umbrella term used to represent a cluster of symptoms that can be due to a variety of brain
disorders (see Chapter 3). The symptoms include loss of memory, judgment, and reasoning, as well as changes
in mood and behaviour. Functioning across everyday activities is impaired. It is important however, that support
providers and health care professionals are aware that other conditions can produce symptoms similar to dementia. These can include depression, thyroid disease, infections, and drug interactions (Alzheimer Society of Canada,
2011). All of these need to be considered by health care professionals when there is concern about dementia or
dementia-like features.

Impact of Support Providers on Health Status
It is important for support providers to work with family members and to keep them or appointed guardians
informed (for example, a family member who has been given substitute decision-maker status for an adult brother

58 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

or sister.) In addition to simply being good, respectful practice, it may be a legal requirement to discuss health
issues, plans, and potential actions with loved ones, and obtain consent for particular procedures.
With that understanding, support providers can have an impact on maintaining and improving health status by:
• Arranging health care screening for potential health problems, and particularly for health problems that
occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities (for example, vision and hearing screens, as well as
screens that are commonly recommended for all people at particular ages)
• Preventing or limiting the spread of infections by regularly and strategically washing their hands and sneezing into their sleeve (support providers should stay away from the workplace if they are ill)
• Using proper feeding and drinking techniques when assisting individuals with severe neuromuscular
impairment and dependency needs, to decrease the risk of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia
• Promoting fitness and a heart-healthy lifestyle with attention given to exercise/activity and nutrition (with
the guidance of appropriate health care and fitness professionals, and with attention to limitations imposed
by some conditions)
• Knowing about and attending to the special dietary needs of individuals with disorders that require dietary
modifications (such as phenylketonuria), with the guidance of appropriate health care professionals
• Ensuring that immunizations and immunization records are up-to-date
• Enabling access to the same health promotion information as other members of the general population
through
◦ Modifying health promotion information as needed to promote understanding, with the assistance of
public health professionals
◦ Providing opportunities to practice a healthy lifestyle
• Knowing, monitoring, recording, and reporting effects and side effect of medications; if giving medications
is a recognized responsibility, giving them in the prescribed manner and in a safe and reliable way that conforms to best practice policies and procedures; arranging for regular medication reviews
• Recognizing that all behaviour is communication and that behaviour can communicate meaningful information about an individual’s health, which is particularly important when working with individuals with severe
disabilities and others who do not speak, or who have limited speech (for example, self-injurious behaviour
such as wrist biting or head banging is commonly associated with pain in people with severe disabilities,
when it has not occurred before)
• Following or helping to improve existing policies and procedures, and obeying legal obligations related to
the treatment of people with intellectual disabilities
• Participating in ongoing education programs that teach how to work with people with challenging behaviours (when they exist) in an effective manner, with attention to respect and dignity

COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 59

Health Promotion
The World Health Organization (2000) has stated that people with intellectual disabilities and their support
providers need appropriate and ongoing education about healthy living practices. This information has commonly
been inaccessible to many people with intellectual disabilities because of their dependency on others, and because
of limited ability to understand, integrate, and independently act on healthy lifestyle information.
Gaining the attention of people with intellectual disabilities and their support providers is a central health promotion strategy. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, this means that healthy lifestyle information needs to
be accessible, discussed, practised, and reinforced in the places where people with intellectual disabilities live,
work, learn, and socialize (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2002). Toward that end, health promotion planning requires the conscious, deliberate inclusion or targeting of people with intellectual disabilities
and the development of strategies that better promote understanding and intended action by people with intellectual disabilities and their support providers. The World Health Organization suggests adapting existing self-care
and wellness programs to fit the needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Depending on specific needs,
this may mean using assistive technology and different forms of media to imbed learning and reinforce healthy
behaviours. It may also mean using a no-fail approach that includes reducing complex information into its more
easily understood component parts and teaching in an incremental way until desired learning is established.

Health Promotion
Key Points for Caregivers
Men and women with intellectual disabilities often lack the skill and opportunities to independently practise healthy living. Support providers and health care professionals are important to maintaining and
improving health of people with intellectual disabilities through healthy living practices. This means that
it is important for support providers and health care professionals to locate or develop best practice health
promotion programs and then apply those programs. This gives people with intellectual disabilities the
same opportunities to live healthy lives as other citizens.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have discussed the disparity in health status and lifespan between people with intellectual disabilities and the general population. For a small proportion of individuals with intellectual disabilities, health
problems and reduced lifespan can be attributed to conditions associated with specific disorders, which can cooccur with or cause intellectual disabilities. For the most part, however, disparity in health status and reduced
lifespan can be attributed to external factors that limit access to health care, or health care that is inappropriate or
not equal to that received by most of the general population.
After the discussion of external factors affecting health status, we presented a discussion of issues and health
problems that are particularly common to persons with intellectual disabilities. This included a discussion of the

60 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

substantial vulnerability to mistreatment that many people with intellectual disabilities experience, and a specific
discussion of Down syndrome and other health problems that occur more frequently. Accelerated aging was said
to affect people with Down syndrome, but the entire population of persons with intellectual disabilities was also
described as experiencing higher rates of many aging-related disorders and limitations.
Because of the high proportion of people with intellectual disabilities who require medications, and often multiple
medications (polypharmacy), we have stressed the importance of safely providing and then monitoring the impact
of medication use. The roles and responsibilities of support and health care providers received attention throughout the chapter, with the understanding that both groups are important to maintaining or improving the health of
individuals with intellectual disability. Health promotion has been discussed as a particular strategy for maintaining and improving health that until now has largely been inaccessible to people with intellectual disabilities.

CHAPTER 5: WHEN THE PROBLEM IS PAIN

Assessing for pain
DEBRA DUSOME, R.N., EX.A.T., M.A. (PSYCHIATRIC NURSING)

Introduction
Just like all people, individuals with intellectual disabilities experience pain. People with intellectual disabilities
experience chronic pain related to medical conditions such as arthritis, cerebral palsy with significant spasticity,
heart conditions, migraines, toothaches, earaches, infections, and other health issues. They experience pain related
to traumatic injuries such as falls, accidents, broken bones, bruising, and injury from violence perpetrated against
them. Some health condition interventions such as surgery or assessment procedures may be intrusive and painful.
Medical assessments and treatment interventions can be scary and painful for any person, but they can be especially frightening for an individual with both intellectual disabilities and mental health challenges. Medical
assessments and interventions often lead to an increase in anxiety, and sometimes aggressive behaviour, when
individuals don’t understand what and why certain events are happening (McKenzie, Smith & Purcell, 2012).
According to McCaffrey (1968), pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is and exists whenever he or
she says it does. But a problem arises when individuals cannot report what is happening to them. The majority of
individuals with intellectual disabilities are able to give some account of the pain they are experiencing, but the
descriptions of localization of the pain and the potential origins of the pain can be difficult for some to articulate
(Findlay, Williams & Scior, 2014; Hennequin, Morin, & Feine, 2000). Individuals who lack expressive language
and have limited comprehension of language can usually only articulate their distress through changes in behaviour and facial expression, so pain must be assessed using a combination of behavioural cues and proxy information (information provided by others) (Davies & Evans, 2001).

Ethical Principles for Addressing Physical Health Conditions and Assessing Pain
The ethical principles of beneficence (the duty to benefit another) and non-maleficence (the duty to do no harm)
oblige health care professionals, caregivers, and direct support staff to provide medical care for health problems
64

WHEN THE PROBLEM IS PAIN • 65

and pain management and comfort to all individuals, including those who are unable to speak for themselves
(Herr et al., 2011). The principles of justice (the equal treatment of individuals) and respect for human dignity also
require support workers to do the best for individuals in their care.

The Hierarchy of Pain Assessment Techniques
Pain assessment techniques should follow a logical progression or hierarchy such as the one devised by Herr and
colleagues (2011).
Obtain self-report. Get as much self-report of pain as possible. This may be a simple yes or no head nod or vocalization. It could include pointing or hand grasps or eye blinking. If a self-report is not possible, state the reason
and proceed with assessment.
Search for potential causes of pain. Does the individual have arthritis or other chronic medical conditions that
could be causing pain? Has the person experienced a trauma that would cause pain or has he or she experienced
surgery or treatments such as wound care, blood tests, rehabilitation activities, or positioning/turning that are normally known to cause pain? Does the person show a significant change in behaviour such as signs of trouble with
breathing, fainting, or change in bowel movements or passing urine?
Observe the person’s behaviour. Use valid and reliable behavioural pain measurement tools. Look for a change
in the individual’s normal behaviour patterns, such as a normally outgoing person becoming more withdrawn, or
a quiet, passive person starting to strike out aggressively, or a person engaging in self-injurious behaviour that is
not typical (Bosch, 2002; Carr & Owen-Deschryver, 2007). Sleep and apparent sedation do not necessarily rule
out a person experiencing pain. It is important that the assessment for pain involves the caregiver or staff person
with the greatest knowledge of the person and his or her regular behaviours.
Obtain proxy reports of pain and behaviour/activity changes. Credible information can be obtained by proxy
(from family members, parents, unlicensed or professional caregivers) who know the individual well. Parents and
consistent caregivers are often the best sources of reliable information to assist with pain assessment. These individuals may have direct knowledge of how the person has responded to painful or illness-related situations in the
past. They may be able to pick up on subtle signs that a new caregiver may not notice. Combine proxy information
with direct observation of the individual and a thorough health assessment and examination. Proxy information
does not take the place of a thorough physical, mental, and diagnostic workup.
Attempt a trial of pain relief medication or comfort measures. If mild or moderate pain is suspected, try comfort
measures and non-opioid (non-narcotic) medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen every six hours for 24
hours. If behaviour improves, assume pain was the cause. For severe pain, a low-dose short-acting pain reliever
such as hydrocodone or morphine should be given as a one-time dose under the direction of a physician to see
if it brings relief. If so, a routine of regular pain medication may be ordered to manage pain. If pain or distress
is not relieved after a reasonable pain relief trial with medication, then further assessment is required to identify
the potential problem. In individuals with intellectual disabilities it is important to start with a lower dose of medication and work up to an effective dose, as these individuals may have greater sensitivities to medications. Go
slowly, but the ultimate goal is to treat the pain effectively.

Guiding Principles Pain Assessment
People with intellectual disabilities have been cognitively impaired since birth or early childhood, and their intellectual disability continues throughout their lifetime (Herr et al., 2011). Intellectual disabilities can be accompanied by physical disabilities as well (Bottos & Chambers, 2006). An IQ of 50 to 70 indicates mild cognitive
impairment and represents 85% of the population of people with intellectual disabilities. The majority of these
individuals are verbal and usually acquire academic skills to the level of Grade 6. Most can self-report on their
pain and the circumstances related to their pain. Individuals with an IQ below 50 have moderate, severe, or profound cognitive impairments. The Faces Pain Scale—Revised (see figure 5.1) can be used for those with suspected mental age greater than five years of age (Goodenough et. al., 1999).
Bottos and Chambers (2006) report that both children and adults with intellectual disabilities have higher tolerance for pain experiences when compared with healthy individuals. This may be related to challenges in recognizing and communicating pain to others. People with intellectual disabilities have been observed carrying out
normal daily activities even when they have been seriously injured. Children and adults with intellectual disabilities often have medical conditions that require ongoing treatment or regular procedures and investigations that
are associated with pain. Caregivers, family members, and professional caregivers need to regularly assess for the
presence of pain, its location, and its severity. Once pain is identified, it needs to be treated and comfort measures
provided.
Individual behavioural responses to pain vary from an increase in activity, such as pacing and vocalizations, to
dampening of behaviours, such as becoming quieter and isolating from others. Although there have been some
reports of differing sensitivities to pain (Foley & McCutcheon, 2004), most children and adults with intellectual
disabilities do have intact sensory function (Symons, Shinde, & Gilles, 2008), which means they feel pain. However, people with intellectual disabilities may not express pain in the ways others do, and therefore it is important
for caregivers to understand an individual’s specific response to pain (Cheetham, 2001; Chivell, 2001; Temple et
al., 2012; McGraft et al., 1998). Neurological perception and motor and/or communication abilities of an individ-

WHEN THE PROBLEM IS PAIN • 67

ual with intellectual disabilities can create challenges for others to effectively recognize that the individual is in
pain. This can result in under- or overestimation of pain, which is why it is important to have people who know
the individual well involved in the pain assessment and treatment process.

Behavioural Pain Assessment Tools

Fig. 5.1 Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale

According to Keck and colleagues (1996), children and adults, including those with intellectual disabilities, can
point to the face on a pain scale that indicates their pain level. Individuals who can count and understand numbers
can use the number scale, and those who can read can successfully use the word scales. The individual needs to
comprehend the relationship of the scale to his or her experience of pain. The picture faces are often preferred as
pain indicators and have been found to be successfully used by people with moderate and severe cognitive disabilities. Identifying possible causes for the pain and developing a treatment plan for most individuals with severe and
profound levels of disability will also require proxy information and a thorough physical assessment. Although
the Faces Pain Scale can indicate the presence of pain, it cannot identify the cause or location of pain.

68 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Individualized Numeric Rating Scale

Fig. 5.2 Individualized Numeric Rating Scale

The Individualized Numeric Rating Scale (Curley, 2010) has primarily been used to assess pain in children with
profound intellectual disability who are unable to use words to express pain (see the figure 5.2). These individuals depend on parents or caregivers who know them extremely well to report on their levels of pain. Several
studies have demonstrated that parents of children with intellectual disabilities can describe their child’s pain indicators (Carter, McArthur, & Cunliffe, 2002; Hunt et al., 2003; Voepel-Lewis, Maliviya, & Tait, 2005).
Care must be taken when transferring the use of the Numeric Rating Scale to adults and to people who do not
have a consistent relationship with the individual with severe and profound intellectual functioning. Ideally, the
setting should have some sort of documented health history of the individual, whether that is an institution, group
home, assisted living, with family members or foster caregivers, or independent with supports. If the parents of
the individual are still living and have regular contact with their son or daughter, they can provide a health history
and their child’s individual response to pain, health challenges, and visits to the doctor, dentist, and other health
care providers. This information is valuable for helping the caregiver assess pain.
The Individualized Numeric Rating Scale is typically used in acute health care settings where the individual is
receiving surgery, is in intensive care, or undergoing procedures known to be extremely painful, such as caring
for severe burns. The parents or consistent caregiver are asked to fill in the scale with behavioural indicators of
pain (Solodiuk et al., 2010). To do this they must have personal knowledge of the person when they are well
and experiencing no pain. They must also have personal knowledge of behavioural indicators when the person
has mild pain (headache, stomach ache), moderate pain (earache, toothache), or severe pain (broken bone, severe
traumatic injury, post-surgery). The scale is then filled in with that person’s individual responses, such as rocking
when in moderate pain, history of head punching when having experienced a previous punctured eardrum, etc.
These behavioural indicators are then used to provide the optimal level of pain relief.

FLACC Pain Assessment Scale
The FLACC Pain Assessment Scale (Merkel et al., 1997) looks at five categories of behaviour in an individual:

WHEN THE PROBLEM IS PAIN • 69

(F) face, (L) legs, (A) activity, (C) cry, and (C) consolability. Each of the five categories is scored from 0 to 2,
which results in a total score between 0 and 10. The higher the score on this instrument, the higher the pain (see
Table 5.1).

Picture Resources for Identifying Emotions of Physical Distress
For individuals who have functional language comprehension but limited expressive language, pictures can often
be used to indicate wants, needs, or signs of distress. The website of Do2Learn Educational Resources for Special
Needs (http://www.do2learn.com) includes many resources and programs for people working with individuals
with special needs, including pictures that can be used for identifying emotions of physical distress. Pictures can
be found at http://www.do2learn.com/picturecards/printcards/2inch/imagegrids.
The pictures shown in figure 5.3 are samples of some of the images that may be useful for working with individuals with intellectual disability. Copies could be made and laminated for use in household, group home, school, or
work settings. Alternatively, a binder could be compiled for each individual, with images that are useful for that
person’s communication with others.

Fig. 5.3 Emotions of Physical Distress

Using the Disability Distress Tool
Meaningful communication with individuals with profound communication limitations depends on family members, caregivers, or support workers to identify and translate verbal, visual, or sound cues. Distress means many
different things to different people (Regnard et al., 2007). Most people would agree that distress relates to more
than just pain and physical discomfort. Many individuals with intellectual disabilities can give cues that they are
distressed but may not be able to clearly communicate the source of their distress. This is most important for the
individual who experiences cognitive, physical, and mental health challenges. Most distress cues are identified
as deviations from the individual’s normal way of being in the world. For this reason, it is important to identify
the characteristics of an individual when he or she is content, so that caregivers can identify a change in verbal,
visual, and sound cues when the individual is in distress.
Regnard and colleagues (2007) emphasize that while distress may be hidden, it is never silent. People with intellectual disabilities have differing abilities for receiving, understanding, remembering, and expressing themselves
through use of verbal and non-verbal language. They depend on others to recognize and translate their specific
language of signs and behaviours. The Disability Distress Tool (DisDAT) was designed by Regnard and validated
by his research team to help caregivers recognize and respond to distress in individuals with intellectual disabilities (see Table 5.2). When using the DisDAT, it is critically important to document signs and cues when an individual is content to compare with signs and cues he or she displays when distressed.

Both people who know the individuals and those who do not know them are able to identify distress using the DisDAT tool. However, people who know an individual’s specific signs and cues able to identify the distress earlier.
(Distress is noted as a change from contented behaviours to behaviours that indicated distress.) Keep in mind that
each person typically has his or her own language of distress. The DisDat is available online at http://prc.coh.org/

72 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Pain and Health Care for Dually Diagnosed Persons
People with intellectual disabilities and mental illness deserve the same standard of care as all other individuals.
This means they should have regular annual checkups with a physician, a dentist, and any other health professional
who is regularly involved in their care, such as a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. Individuals may have
one or more medical conditions that require more regular follow-up (for example, diabetes that requires monitoring by a physician every three months). Caregivers should expect and advocate for this level of care to ensure
that complications related to disease processes are detected early. People with intellectual disabilities may require
a longer appointment time and/or may feel more comfortable if a person they trust accompanies them to their
appointments (see Chapter 4).
Unfortunately many people with dual diagnosis receive substandard care, perhaps because a health care professional holds prejudicial beliefs about individuals with intellectual disabilities, or simply because he or she does
not know how to care for individuals with intellectual disabilities. If an individual has experienced diagnostic testing and surgical procedures in the past without adequate pain treatment, or didn’t understand what was happening
or what was expected, he or she may be fearful and anxious before health care visits. Similarly, when health care
services have not recognized, treated, or managed an individual’s pain well, the caregiver can leave the experience feeling the negative emotional impact (Findlay, Williams, Baum, Scior, 2014).
The gold standard for good pain assessment is to have the individual self-report symptoms as much as he or she
is able before a proxy adds information. Caregivers should report regular behaviour, any changes that they have
observed, and whether they have seen these responses in the past related to specific health care concerns.
None of this information takes the place of a thorough physical assessment and diagnostic workup by a health
care professional. Ideally, clients should see health care professionals who know them well and who have the individual’s health care history. In emergencies and in situations where the individual is in obvious pain or distress,
they may see health care professionals they have never met before. This can be quite frightening and anxietyprovoking for many individuals, especially for those who also have mental health issues (see Chapter 3). Thus,
it is important that the individual be accompanied to appointments or to the emergency department by a family
member or caregiver who knows the most about the person, who can provide comfort, and who is trusted by the
person. Many people with intellectual disabilities may require some anxiety medication or sedation for complex
dental or medical procedures, so they really appreciate having someone with them who cares. Often an individual
can be helped by distracting activities, ongoing conversations, a comforting object, or a promise of an enjoyed
activity after a health care visit.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have discussed the experience of pain. Health care providers, direct support workers, and all
those who care for and about individuals living with intellectual disabilities have an ethical duty to implement
pain assessments with both verbal and non-verbal information. Often the main indicators that a person is in distress are behavioural cues and information from others. The progression or hierarchy of steps to assess pain are 1)
obtain a self-report, 2) search for potential causes, 3) observe behaviours, 4) obtain information from others (proxy
reporting), and 5) attempt a trial of pain medication. People may experience pain even when they are carrying out

WHEN THE PROBLEM IS PAIN • 73

normal daily activities, and therefore a guiding principle is to involve those who know the person throughout the
process of assessing and treating pain.
Five tools to assess physical pain have been explained: 1) the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale, 2) the
Individualized Numeric Rating Scale, 3) the FLACC Pain Assessment Scale, 4) pictures for identifying distress,
and 5) the DisDat. We have emphasized how dually diagnosed people require regular checkups that include thorough physical assessments and diagnostic workups. During complex medical procedures, caregivers can request
that health care professionals provide anxiety medications. Caregivers can provide distracting activities or an
enjoyable activity after the procedure. Assessing and responding when dually diagnosed people say or show that
they are in pain is a critical element in supporting them toward living healthy lives.

CHAPTER 6: BEHAVIOUR THAT HURTS

Self-injuring and aggressive behaviour
ELIZABETH ATHENS, PH.D. (BEHAVIOR ANALYST) AND SHERRI MELROSE, PH.D. (NURSING)

Introduction
Caregivers can struggle with how to respond when people who live with both intellectual disabilities and mental
illness express themselves through behaviours that are hurtful, either to themselves or to others. Unfortunately,
challenging or problem behaviours such as self-injury and aggression are highly prevalent in individuals with
dual diagnosis (Allen & Davis, 2007; Benson & Brooks, 2008; Lowe et al., 2007; Lloyd & Kennedy, 2014). As
well as jeopardizing their own and others’ physical safety, challenging behaviours can result in 1) isolation when
individuals are denied access to community facilities (Emerson, 1995); 2) greater likelihood of chemical restraint
(Webber, McVilly, & Chan, 2011); 3) more frequent admission to psychiatric units than the general population
(Lunsky & Balogh, 2010); and 4) more restrictive interventions during hospital stays (Chaplin, 2011).
In some instances, when people engage in self-injurious and aggressive behaviours, their actions are related to
pain (see Chapter 5), to a health-related disorder (see Chapter 4), or to escalating symptoms of a psychiatric disorder (see Chapter 3). In other instances, their actions may be triggered by stress (Charlot & Shedlack, 2002) or a
lack of the social skills needed to cope with life events (Barnhill & McNelis, 2012; Waters & Healy, 2012).
Medications, particularly antipsychotics, are often prescribed despite mounting concern about their overuse (Edelsohn et al., 2014; Gormez & Varghese, 2014; Lunsky & Elserafi, 2012). When challenging behaviour is not caused
by psychiatric disorders, treatment with psychiatric medication can even cause the behaviour to worsen (Allen &
Davies, 2007; Valdovinos et al., 2005).
Clearly, it is important to investigate any possible links between challenging behaviours and physical health, mental health, and stress or social triggers. It is also important to collaborate with health professionals about prescribing medications that may help. However, first and foremost, when people are engaging in hurtful behaviour, these
behaviours must be addressed. Although challenging behaviours may have started in response to identifiable concerns, they often persist long after the original concern has been resolved (May & Kennedy, 2010).

When individuals engage in behaviour that hurts it is helpful to focus less on the causes of the behaviour and more
on what purpose the behaviour serves. Applied behavioural analysis is a treatment approach that investigates what
purpose a behaviour may be serving and helps develop methods to change the behaviour with new ways of meeting an individual’s needs (Behavior Analyst Certification Board, n.d.). In this chapter we provide an overview of
applied behavioural analysis and then discuss strategies to help decrease self-injurious and aggressive behaviour.

Overview of Applied Behavioural Analysis
A widely accepted definition of applied behaviour analysis is that it is a systematic process of applying interventions grounded in learning theory to both improve behaviours and to demonstrate that the interventions are
responsible for improving the behaviour (Baer, Wolf, & Risley, 1968). Extending from early work based on principles of behaviour modification, behaviour analysts use positive reinforcement to increase desirable behaviours,
generalize learned behaviours, or reduce undesirable behaviours. One of the key tools that professionals in the
field of applied behavioural analysis use on a regular basis is functional behavioural assessment.

Overview of Applied Behavioural Analysis
Key Points for Caregivers
People may hurt themselves (called self-injury) or other people (called aggression). Self-injury or aggression may occur because of pain, a health-related disorder, stress, as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder,
or because a person lacks social skills. Medications may even make the problem worse. These possibilities
must all be investigated. Challenging behaviour that starts for one reason may continue even when that
reason is no longer there. Behavioural analysis looks at what needs are served by a behaviour and then
finds other ways that people can meet those needs.

Functional Behavioural Assessment
Although most caregivers are not expected to implement functional behavioural assessments with their clients,
understanding the thinking behind this tool can make an important difference in providing evidence-informed
care. Morris (n.d.) identified the ABCs of functional behavioural assessments as Analysis, Behaviour, and Consequence. Analysis occurs when professionals direct the client to perform an action to identify existing or previous
behaviour. Behaviour is the response from the client: successful performance, non-compliance, or no response.
Consequence is the therapist’s response “which can range from strong positive reinforcement (i.e., a special treat,
verbal praise) to a strong negative response, such as ‘No!’” (Morris, n.d. ). When behavioural analysts implement
functional behavioural assessments, these ABCs ground their thinking.
Functional behavioural assessments look beyond observable behaviour and examine what function the behaviour
may be serving (Mauro, n.d.). Knowing what is valuable, important, and reinforcing to individuals can help caregivers support their clients toward alternative ways of behaving that will still meet client needs. Functional analysis of challenging sexual behaviours is discussed in Chapter 7.

78 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Research with children and individuals living with autism spectrum disorders has contributed to our understanding
of functional behavioural analysis, and people with dual diagnosis can benefit from insights generated from this
research. One seminal study conducted with children sheds important light on why individuals would continue
or maintain their challenging behaviours. Iwata and colleagues (1982, 1994) identified three variables or reasons
why challenging behaviours were actually serving a valuable purpose. The first reason was that the behaviour
resulted in attention. In the study, children were given toys to play with and told that an adult in the room had work
to do. With each demonstration of challenging behaviour, the child was given attention, albeit socially disapproving attention, with comments such as “Don’t do that!” The second reason was that the behaviour afforded them
an escape from demands. When children were given educational activities to complete, their challenging behaviours resulted in not having to complete the activity. The third reason was that the behaviour seemed to increase
the sensory stimulation the children were experiencing when being alone. Motivation to continue the behaviour
was believed to be linked to the feelings of self-stimulation that occurred. Self-stimulation is defined as behaviour
that creates internal pleasure or removes displeasure without the involvement of any other person (O’Neill et al.,
1997).
Subsequent research also supports these findings and extends our growing understanding of what behavioural analysts look for when implementing functional assessments. For example, Iwata and colleagues (1994) studied 152
individuals with developmental disabilities who demonstrated self-injurious behaviour over an 11-year period.
Their findings indicated that negative reinforcement in the form of escape from demands or aversive stimulation
accounted for 38.1% of the behaviours, the largest proportion of the sample. Positive reinforcement in the form
of access to preferred stimulation such as attention, food, or materials, accounted for 26.3% of the behaviours.
Automatic reinforcement of the senses, also known as autonomic sensory reinforcement, accounted for 25.7%.
Automatic reinforcement is a type of reinforcement that creates a favourable result without any involvement
from others (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). Multiple controlling variables (such as both escape and attention)
accounted for 5.3% of the behaviours, and 4.6% were uninterpretable.
Similar results are found in numerous follow-up studies of functional analyses for self-injuring or aggressive
behaviour (Beavers, Iwata, & Lerman, 2013; Hanley, Iwata, & McCord, 2003; Kurtz et al., 2003; O’Reilly, 1995).
In short, people may be demonstrating challenging behaviour that serves the purpose of escaping from aversive
stimulation, accessing preferred stimulation, or creating automatic sensory reinforcement. For example, individuals may want to escape from math work, house cleaning, life skills activities such as brushing teeth, stimulation that is too loud, work that is too difficult to complete, or even from a non-preferred texture. They may want
to access preferred stimulation such as being with people they like, tasting food they enjoy, and participating in
activities they believe are fun. Finally, they may want to create autonomic sensory stimulation to bring about a
feeling of pressure (such as head banging), or the sound produced by the behaviour (such as hitting ears), or different sights (such as eye gouging), or tactile experiences (such as scratching and self-biting).
It may be useful to think of these behaviours as a form of self-expression and a way of communicating needs,
such as “I want attention” or “I need a break.” Viewing challenging behaviours through the lens of behavioural
analysis, self-injuring behaviour may indicate a need for sensory stimulation, and aggressive behaviour may indicate a need for social reinforcement.

Functional Behavioural Analysis
Key Points for Caregivers
Functional behaviour analysis helps us understand why people continue injuring themselves or being
aggressive. Three common reasons for any behaviour are that it:
1. Provides an escape from something a person does not like
2. Provides access to something a person does like
3. Provides stimulation that a person can create when they are alone
When people need to escape from an activity that is difficult or unpleasant, providing a break may help.
When they need access to something they value, such as favourite people, food, or activities, providing this
access before challenging behaviour begins may prevent the challenging behaviour from occurring. When
people are alone and they need stimulation, they can be given alternatives through opportunities for them
to see, hear, smell, touch, and taste.

Topography of Behaviour
Having a familiarity with the vocabulary or terms used to describe behaviours demonstrated by individuals with
dual diagnosis is important. One term used by behavioural analysts and other professional groups when implementing functional behavioural assessments or when devising behaviour intervention plans is topography of
behaviour. Topography is a detailed description of the natural features of a geographical area. In other words,
topography clearly describes what is there and what we see. A topographical description does not include interpretations of what is observed. For example, maps of a geographical area do not usually include commentary about
whether the area is “good” or “bad.”
When topography frames a way of describing challenging behaviour, the same clarity of description and absence
of judging value or imposing expectations is expected. For example, reporting that an individual was disrespectful
does not describe what is there and what we can see. Descriptions such as “Terra refused to comply with a direction” provide clarity. Similarly, Webster (n.d.) illustrated two different topographical ways of reporting a tantrum.
Wording could be “Dylan threw himself on the floor, kicked, and screamed in a high-pitched voice. He did not
make physical contact with other individuals, furniture, or other items in the environment.” Different wording
could be “Dylan swung his arms and struck other clients and staff, while screaming in a high-pitched voice”
(Webster, n.d.). Although each of these reports describes a tantrum, the topographical elements of the descriptions
provide critical information when assessing aggression.

80 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Topography of Behaviour
Key Points for Caregivers
Challenging behaviours must be described and reported in detail so that others have a clear picture of what
people are actually doing. Topography of behaviour, like topography of a geographic area illustrated in
a map, describes only what is there and what we see. Topographies of behaviour do not judge value or
include expectations.

Strategies to Help Decrease Self-Injurious and Aggressive Behaviour
Once functional behavioural assessments have been implemented to indicate the purpose a behaviour may be
serving, and the topography of the behaviour has been described clearly and without judgment, caregivers can
consider new ways to support individuals toward meeting their needs. In this section, we draw from the field of
behavioural analysis to outline three approaches that can help decrease self-injurious and aggressive behaviour.
The first addresses escaping from aversive stimulation; the second addresses accessing preferred stimulation; and
the third addresses creating automatic sensory reinforcement.
Escaping from aversive stimulation. When individuals hurt themselves or others to escape from situations that
are aversive, behavioural analysis interventions can be directed toward 1) making the behaviour no longer a way
to escape (Escape Extinction, EE); 2) providing instruction to help make the situation less aversive (Skills Training, SK); or 3) finding an alternative way to escape (Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behavior, DRAB)
(Geiger, Carr, & Leblanc, 2010).
Accessing preferred stimulation. When individuals engage in challenging behaviour to access the kind of stimulation they prefer (such as attention from people, food, or activities), strategies can be directed toward other ways
they can access these people and the things they enjoy (Functional Communication Training, FCT). For example,
as part of an FCT approach, caregivers gave a card reading “I want to talk” to an individual demonstrating aggressive behaviour (Roscoe, Kindle, & Pence, 2010). By using the card instead of aggressive behaviour, the individual was able to access what was important to him, which in this case was conversations with others. In another
example of FCT, caregivers taught an individual demonstrating self-injurious behaviour to ask, “Am I doing good
work?” Each time the individual did this instead of hurting herself, caregivers provided her with 10 to 15 seconds
of attention (Durand & Carr, 1991).
Creating automatic sensory reinforcement. When individuals engage in challenging behaviours, particularly
behaviours that are self-injurious to create their own sensory reinforcement, finding the right strategy to help
decrease the behaviour can be difficult. Since autonomic sensory reinforcement does not rely on other people, the
reinforcement that caregivers are able to offer may not be meaningful. Identifying what might be pleasing about a
behaviour that is hurtful to self or others is not straightforward. Questions must be asked about whether the pleasing stimulus is a physiologic effect, and if so, what is the feeling?

BEHAVIOR THAT HURTS • 81

However, strategies that ignore the challenging behaviour and provide reinforcement when the behaviour does not
occur for a specified period of time (Differential Reinforcement of Other, DRO) show promise. In one case where
DRO effectively decreased a behaviour, caregivers set up a schedule for praising a boy when he decreased his
skin-picking behaviour. The schedule included leaving the boy alone but entering the room regularly. Each time
the boy did not engage in skin-picking, caregivers offered a token and praise such as “Good job not scratching”
(Toussaint & Tiger, 2012).
Another strategy that can lead to substantial decreases in automatically reinforced challenging behaviour is environmental enrichment. This strategy begins with an assessment that identifies what items the individual prefers,
and then ensuring that these items are made available. Research has shown this strategy can substantially decrease
self-injury that is automatically reinforced (Lindauer, DeLeon, & Fisher, 1999; Smith et. al, 1993; Vollmer, Marcus, & LeBlanc, 1994). Environmental enrichment is the least labour intensive of all the strategies described in
this chapter. No one is required to monitor individuals in order to implement the strategy; instead, the preferred
items are made available in ways that provide an enriched environment. This approach may be useful when little time is available for individual attention. To successfully implement this strategy over longer periods of time,
individuals need continued assessment for items/activities they still enjoy, those they have tired of, and new ones
that could be added.
A final strategy simply makes the desired sensory stimuli freely available. For example, when an individual
engaged in self-injurious hand mouthing, behavioural analysts hypothesized that his hand mouthing produced
mouth stimulation, hand stimulation, or both. In response, they made Twizzlers (licorice-flavoured candy sticks),
mouth guards, and hand stimulators freely available for mouth and hand stimulation (Piazza et al., 2000).
As the preceding discussion has illustrated, when caregivers are able to accurately identify what an individual
finds stimulating about a challenging behaviour, they are more able to support them towards behaving in ways that
do not focus on hurting themselves or others.

Strategies to Help Decrease Self-Injurious and Aggressive Behaviour
Key Points for Caregivers
Strategies to help decrease self-injurious and aggressive behaviours provide individuals with alternative
ways to meet their needs.
1. When people need to escape difficult situations, strategies can prevent escape, can offer instruction to
make the situation less difficult, or can offer an alternative way to escape.
2. When people want access to stimulation they like, such as food, activities, or attention from people,
strategies can make these people and things available. Strategies can include:
a. Card reading or saying “Help please” or “Break please” as an alternative to aggressive or self-injurious behaviour
b. Presenting fewer or less difficult tasks for the individual to complete
c. Breaking down larger or complex tasks into smaller steps

82 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

d. Providing help and prompts to the individual at regular and ongoing points of time, only reducing
help when the individual shows that he or she has mastered the skill independently
3. When people want stimulation for their senses when they are alone, strategies can offer comparable
ways to experience the sensations and feelings. An example of a strategy is substituting appropriate food
treats to provide alternate sensations experienced during hand mouthing.
a. Regular scheduled praise from a caregiver, such as “Good job not …” when challenging behaviour
does not occur within a specified period of time
b. Providing preferred items for the individual to interact with instead of engaging in challenging
behaviour.

Conclusion
People may engage in self-injurious and aggressive behaviours because of pain, a health-related disorder, symptoms of a psychiatric disorder, medications, stress, or because they lack social skills. The behaviour may even
continue or be maintained long after the problem that caused the behaviour been resolved. In this chapter, we have
emphasized the importance of addressing these challenging behaviours and provided strategies from the field of
applied behavioural analysis that can help decrease the behaviours.
Behavioural analysis is an approach that determines the purpose a behaviour serves or what value it might have
to people, and then finds other ways to meet their needs. Functional behaviour analysis is a tool that can identify
specific reasons why people would find it valuable to maintain self-injurious and aggressive behaviour. Common reasons are that the behaviour provides escape from aversive stimulations (unpleasant or difficult experiences), access to preferred stimulation (pleasant experiences often with people, food, and activities), and creates
automatic sensory reinforcement (sensory stimulation when the person is alone). Topographical descriptions are
clear detailed descriptions of the behaviour we can see. When topography of behaviour is explained in functional
behaviour analysis, no judgments about value are included.
Knowing that people might be engaging in challenging behaviours to escape, caregivers can try strategies to prevent escape, to offer instruction and help, or to find alternative ways to escape. Similarly, knowing that people
might want access to people, food, and activities they like, caregivers can try to make these people and things
more available. Finally, knowing that people might value stimulation for their senses when they are alone, caregivers can look for ways to offer pleasing experiences with sight, sound, smell, and touch.

Promoting healthy sexual expression

Introduction
Individuals with intellectual disabilities experience difficulty in interpreting behavioural cues within their social
environments. This may in turn create negative outcomes for their expression of sexuality (Meany-Tavaras &
Gavidia-Payne, 2012). People with intellectual disabilities are overrepresented as both victims and perpetrators of
sexual offences (Hogg et al., 2001; Lambrick & Glaser, 2004). According to Szollos and McCabe (1995), 50% of
females with intellectual disabilities will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, and males with intellectual disability are more likely to be sexually abused than other males.
One of the most significant factors in the sexual victimization of individuals with intellectual disabilities is their
knowledge deficit regarding acceptable behaviour. More specifically, they may have limited sexual knowledge in
the areas of consent and what constitutes appropriate sexual contact (Galea, Butler, & Iacono, 2004; Gust et al.,
2003). They can find it difficult to assert their own opinions and they may give in to the suggestions or directions
given by others, particularly when expressing their sexuality (Hayashi, Arakida & Ohashi, 2011).
People with intellectual disabilities depend on family members and service providers to teach them how to appropriately express their sexuality, which is a critical aspect of social competence. Many individuals with intellectual
disability need ongoing education about sexuality, particularly self-protective strategies, so that others will not
take advantage of them.
However, depending on past life experiences, the kind of education needed varies from one person to another.
Individuals with a mild to moderate disability who live with their own or a foster family may have attended sexual
health classes as part of the social skills training provided in schools, vocational programs, and sheltered workshops. Those with a severe or profound disability who live in group homes or institutions surrounded by professional caregivers and others like themselves will have had fewer educational opportunities.

SEXUALITY • 87

Those with more social skills training, more exposure to different life experiences, and more opportunities to
function socially can be expected to demonstrate more social competencies (Abbott & McConkey, 2006; Simpson, 2010). Despite the diverse educational needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities, supporting them to
show healthy expressions of their sexuality is important. In this chapter we discuss three critical areas that should
be considered when providing sexual education support: discussion topics, understanding boundaries, and differentiating between challenging behaviours and sex offending behaviours.

Discussion Topics for Sexual Education Support
Although major gains have been made in the last two decades in normalizing, including, and integrating people
with intellectual disability into community settings, their sexual health continues to be an overlooked area (Scotti
et al., 1996; Thompson et al., 2014). Historically, in many countries intellectual disability or “feeble-mindedness”
was considered hereditary, and individuals identified as mentally defective were sterilized without their knowledge to prevent procreation (Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004). Today, sexual education programs for people with
intellectual disabilities are becoming more commonplace and researchers are beginning to understand the kinds
of discussion topics that are most valuable.
Critical discussion topics that can help individuals begin to understand their own personal sexuality are puberty,
menstruation, menopause, masturbation, relationships, protective behaviours, sexuality, safer sex practices, contraception, pregnancy and birth, sexual health screening tests, sexually transmitted infections, and legal issues
regarding sexuality (Butler, Leighton, & Galea, 2003). Other topics are body grooming and cleanliness, first
impressions in speaking to your partner, communication training, self-assertiveness training, a sense of space
between participant and others, manners in public spaces, sexual harassment, stalker victimization, male–female
relationships, and differences between male and female bodies (Hayashi, Arkida, & Ohashi, 2011). While support
workers and family members themselves may not be the one delivering sexual education programs, it is helpful
for all those involved to initiate discussions about these topic areas, invite further questions, and provide ongoing
guidance.
A controversial sexual education topic that also needs to be discussed is parenting. Both family members and
caregivers have expressed concern about parenthood and marriage for adults with intellectual disabilities (Oliver
et al., 2002). Parents with intellectual disabilities represent one of the most vulnerable parenting groups (Booth &
Booth, 2005). Most concerns relate to neglect or emotional abuse, with 40% to 60% of parents with intellectual
disabilities having their children removed by child protective agencies because they failed to meet the standard of
good enough parenting (Cleaver & Nicholson, 2005). Researchers believe that these numbers could be lowered
if parents with intellectual disabilities had adequate supports and education (Cleaver & Nicholson, 2005; Murphy
& Feldman, 2002). Specific areas these parents need help with are generalizing information from one setting to
another; knowledge about normal childhood development and the care needs of infants, children, and adolescents;
and knowledge about how to play with and show appropriate affection to their children (Wilson et al., 2013).
According to the International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual Disabilities (2008), parents with
intellectual disabilities need both parenting skill education and a strong social network. When parents, especially
mothers, are surrounded by helpful family members, friends, and professionals, they develop an increased capacity to care for their children (Guinea, 2001; Koeske & Koeske, 1990; Wilson et al., 2013). Unfortunately, the real-

88 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

ity is that these parents often find themselves with limited social and environmental support (Mayes, Llewellyn,
& McConnell, 2006).

Discussion Topics for Sexual Education Support
Key Points for Caregivers
Sexual health is often overlooked in individuals with intellectual disabilities. They are very vulnerable to
sexual abuse and may not understand what consenting to sexual activity means. They may not know how to
express their sexuality. Sex education programs often include important discussions of normal expressions
of sexuality such as masturbation, relationships, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, and safe sex
practices. These kinds of topics must also be part of the everyday conversations that take place between
intellectually disabled individuals and the people in their lives. When individuals with intellectual disabilities are parents, they need a network of people around them and opportunities to learn about children’s
development and showing appropriate affection to children.

Understanding Boundaries
Boundaries are the limits in relationships within which we feel psychologically safe (Kent, 2012). Individuals
with intellectual disabilities may have difficulty understanding the boundaries that are expected in conventional
social relationships. For example, they may interrupt, have difficulty taking turns or waiting for assistance, and
steal other’s belongings. When interacting with caregivers, they may express sexual feelings through behaviours
such as intruding into the caregiver’s personal space, requesting to be a boyfriend or girlfriend, and attempting to
kiss or touch in a sexual manner. These behaviours leave caregivers feeling confused and uncomfortable. A fitting
response is for staff groups to consistently and immediately provide straightforward feedback that these behaviours are not acceptable.
Similarly, individuals with intellectual disabilities may demonstrate inappropriate sexual behaviours in public. Examples are masturbation, genital exposure, inappropriate sexual touching, and embracing others too closely
(Bielecki & Swender, 2004; Nagahama, 2003; Yamamoto, 1991). They may walk into public areas naked, touch
others, or allow themselves to be touched. They may grab others roughly to get attention or indicate a personal
need. In individuals with dual diagnosis, these overt sexual demonstrations may indicate an escalating psychiatric
disorder. Rather than simply viewing these behaviours as distasteful, it is vital for caregivers to document, report,
and discuss them with other staff members and health professionals.
It is important to hold these individuals accountable for their behaviour. When behaviours seriously violate the
boundaries and feelings of psychological safety for caregivers and others, it is important to ask what would happen to those who are not intellectually disabled if they engaged in these same behaviours. If the answer is that they
would be charged with sexual or physical assault, then involving the police must be considered. Treating people
with disabilities differently suggests that they are not responsible for their actions and thus not real members of
society.

SEXUALITY • 89

Caregivers model the process of setting boundaries through their own actions. They can use anatomical rather
than slang or baby-talk words during discussions related to sexuality. They should avoid flirting, telling or listening to sexual jokes, and swearing or offensive language (Cooper, 2012). They can show respect for modesty
by performing personal care in private rather than public spaces. Simple acts such as knocking before entering
someone`s room and keeping doors open during private discussions communicate subtle cues about acceptable
behaviour. Instead of allowing a non-verbal person to grab others in an aggressive way when he or she wants
something, redirecting the action by demonstrating a more gentle way to reach out can be helpful. As previously
mentioned and in accordance with any applicable agency policy, caregivers must confront and report inappropriate expression of sexual expression to their supervisors or even the police.

Providing Resources
For individuals with limited language or who use pictures as part of their communication strategies, signs and/or
picture cards for yes, no, don’t touch, and stop are useful. As discussed in Chapter 5, prepared cards illustrating
common needs and feelings are available at the Do2Learn (n.d.) website, http://www.do2learn.com.
Another useful resource to promote awareness about boundaries is the Circle of Relationships activity (WalkerHirsch & Champagne, 1991). Here, different levels of intimacy and appropriate social behaviours are indicated by
colour groups (see Table 7.1). A hand-out of Table 7.1 could be provided to participants, who can then be invited
to link names of people they know to a colour group.

Understanding Boundaries and Providing Resources
Key Points for Caregivers
Establishing boundaries in relationships can create safe psychological spaces. When individuals with an
intellectual disability express their sexuality in inappropriate ways, their behaviour needs to be addressed
just as it would with non-disabled individuals. Open demonstrations of sexuality may be linked to mental
illnesses and must be reported and discussed with other staff and health professionals. In some instances,
the behaviour must be reported to police. Caregivers can model respectful behaviour that shows the difference between private and public actions. This is an important way for individuals with intellectual disability to learn about setting boundaries. Resources are available, such as picture cards and the Circle of
Relationships activity.

Differentiating between Challenging Behaviours and Sex Offending Behaviours
People with intellectual disabilities and offending behaviour, including sexual offending, usually access services
from both the justice system and disability care services. Staff from different professional groups may not agree
on whether the behaviour should be viewed as challenging or sex offending, Problematic sexual behaviour can be
aligned with clinical processes and viewed either way (Doyle, 2004). Although philosophies about challenging
behaviour and sex offending behaviour have some characteristics in common, knowing that significant differences
exist can be helpful in understanding how to provide consistent and informed support.
Challenging behaviours are viewed as violent and have been defined as “behaviour of such intensity, frequency
or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy or behaviour which is
likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities” (Emerson, 1995, p. 4). Sexually violent behaviour includes actual, attempted, or threatened sexual contact with a person who is non-consenting or unable to give consent (Boer et al., 1997). This includes all sexual contact with children. The behaviour
may interfere with the gaining of new skills and learning opportunities, so that the quality of life of others may be
impacted as well as the quality of life of the individual with the challenging behaviour. Examples of challenging
behaviours include self-injury, self-stimulation, physical and verbal aggression, sexually inappropriate behaviour,
and property destruction (Doyle, 2004).
The term challenging behaviour has been used as an attempt to avoid further stigmatizing a population of individuals who are already marginalized. It is meant to demonstrate that the behaviour is an adaptive response to
other factors or a means of communicating distress to others (as discussed in Chapter 6). Assessment is likely
to incorporate indicators of psychiatric disorders. Interventions focus on exploring the environmental, biological,
educational, and social factors responsible for the behaviour rather than placing the blame on the individual participating in the behaviour. It is within this way of thinking that clinicians are trying to come to terms with and
develop interventions for sexually violent behaviour.

SEXUALITY • 91

Understanding challenging behaviour requires believing that human behaviour occurs for some reason and within
a certain context. Functional analysis is the way clinicians and workers in the intellectual disability field attempt
to understand the meaning or communicative intent of the behaviour. The relationship between the behaviour, the
preceding events, and the consequences of the behaviour are explored. Treatment processes then look at ways to
alter preceding events or consequences in order to change the behaviour and to address the needs the individual is
attempting to communicate.
Treatment approaches that view the behaviour as sexual offending regard the same actions as violent but emphasize protecting the community and preventing the behaviour from reoccurring. Rather than considering the meaning behind the behaviour, this view suggests that individuals must take responsibility for their behaviour and for
the consequences of their actions. This way of thinking highlights that there is a risk for both the community and
the offending individual if the seriousness of sex offending is underplayed. For example, we cannot hold children
or vulnerable disabled adults responsible for triggering an offender`s behaviour, and we cannot just dismiss the
damaging consequences of the sex offending behaviour.
There are two important arguments against viewing sex offending behaviour as being simply challenging. First,
treatment framed from a sex offending view does not reflect the values inherent in the process of conducting a
functional analysis. Second, there is a risk for both the community and the offending individual if the seriousness
of sex offending is underplayed. Table 7.2 presents differences between behaviours that are challenging and those
that are sex offending (Doyle, 2004).

92 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Table 7.2 Values-based assumptions: Challenging behaviour versus sex offending behaviour
Challenging Behaviour

Sex Offending Behaviour

The primary intention of a functional analysis
approach to challenging behaviour is to identify the purpose, meaning, and communicative intent of a behaviour in order to provide
behavioural support.

Evaluation of intent and motivation is key to understanding offending
behaviour. Darke (1990) indicates that committing sexual offences
achieves power and control over more vulnerable people through the use
of sexual aggression. Sorting out the how and identifying the form the
behaviour takes and the circumstances under which the behaviour occurs is
paramount in order to develop relapse-prevention strategies.

Once the purpose of the individual’s behaviour has been determined, behavioural support is given with the primary aim to hold
that individual’s dignity as a primary concern.

The risky nature of sexual offending behaviour means that the focus needs
to be on the behaviour itself rather than the meaning behind the behaviour.
The damage to vulnerable victims can have great impact on them for the
rest of their lives. While the dignity of the offender is of concern, protecting the community and managing the risk of reoffending behaviour both
compete for priority.

In functional analysis, the goal is to understand the purpose of the behaviour in order to
teach and develop effective alternatives. The
approach is educational and involves the systematic instruction of new adaptive skills.

Assessment of sexual offending behaviour is carried out to prevent and
protect the public and not necessarily to understand the purpose of the
behaviour for the offender. The educational focus is relapse prevention and
addressing contributing factors such as problem solving and decision making, anger management, alcohol and drug abuse prevention, sexuality, and
legal issues such as consent. The Association for the Treatment of Sexual
Abusers website is a helpful resource (http://www.atsa.com/index.html ).

Functional analysis is designed to determine
the relationships between environmental conditions and the person’s behaviours. The
environment has an ongoing reciprocal role in
shaping the behaviour and is the focus of
developing alternative strategies. Precipitating environmental factors and factors that
reinforce or maintain the behaviour are
adapted to facilitate the development of more
adaptive behaviours. The individual is not
blamed.

Removing personal responsibility for offending behaviour is potentially
dangerous. In the case of the sexual offender, the environment may be seen
as only eliciting the expression of an existing deviant sexual orientation
and hence is not a true interaction. Children and vulnerable individuals
cannot be held responsible for the offender’s behaviour. Many people with
intellectual disability who commit sexual offences have limited internal
inhibitors and a poor understanding of the legal consequences of their
behaviour. It is important to emphasize that the behaviour is wrong, it hurts
others, and it has legal and emotional consequences that may affect the
quality of life of the offender as well as the victims.

Differentiating between Challenging Behaviours and Sex Offending Behaviours
Key Points for Caregivers
Inappropriate expressions of sexuality are very serious. Whether they are open or violent, they can traumatize victims and leave offenders facing lifelong consequences. Different professional groups do not all
agree on the best treatment approaches. Some view sexually violent behaviours that hurt others and interfere with quality of life for others as challenging. Others view these behaviours as sexual offending.
Treatment approaches that view the behaviour as challenging will try to find out why individuals act this
way, what the behaviour means, and how it meets an otherwise unmet need. When caregivers are involved,
they will admit that the behaviour is unacceptable and hurts others as well as themselves. They will also

SEXUALITY • 93

recognize that the behaviours are occurring for a reason and they will guide individuals toward meeting
their needs with more acceptable behaviours.
Treatment approaches that view the behaviour as sexual offending will not focus on what the behaviour
means. Here, when caregivers are involved, they will still admit that the behaviour is unacceptable and
hurts others as well as themselves. However, they will pay more attention to strategies that prevent the
behaviour from reoccurring and to protecting all the people in the community that the individual interacts
with.
Although views about treatment approaches are different and each individual is unique, inappropriate
expressions of sexuality must all be reported, discussed, and addressed as a team.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have discussed how caregivers can provide sexual education support to their clients through discussion topics, understanding boundaries, and differentiating between challenging behaviours and sex offending
behaviours. Individuals with intellectual disabilities are very vulnerable to sexual abuse and victimization. They
may not fully understand how to express their sexuality in socially acceptable ways and their consent for sexual
activity may not be well informed. Those who are dually diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder are even more vulnerable. Their behaviour may be directly related to a psychiatric disorder and may indicate an escalating mental
health crisis.
Caregivers can supplement existing sexual education programs in which clients are or have been involved,
through conversations about normal expressions of sexuality such as masturbation, relationships, contraception,
sexually transmitted diseases, and safe sex practices. Individuals with intellectual disabilities may be parents. For
these parents to be supported toward retaining custody of their children and enjoying their family life, they need
most to be surrounded by a network of caring, helpful people.
Understanding boundaries, or the limits we create within relationships to feel psychologically safe, is critically
important. Inappropriate expressions of sexuality such as masturbation in public, genital exposure, inappropriate
sexual touching, and embracing others too closely should not be tolerated. When non-disabled individuals demonstrate this behaviour, it is viewed as inappropriate and often reported to police. Individuals with disabilities are just
as accountable for their behaviour. Caregivers and others in their environment should not be made to feel uncomfortable or psychologically unsafe because of an individual’s behaviour. The behaviour should not be ignored. It
should be discussed among agency staff, recorded, and reported according to agency policy. Caregivers can model
how to set boundaries by requiring acceptable personal space during their interactions with clients.
Any inappropriate expression of sexuality must be taken seriously. People who witness, who are victimized, or
who are assaulted as a consequence of these behaviours can be left devastated. Perpetrators are usually penalized.
Although professionals do not always agree about whether the behaviour should be viewed as challenging or as
sex offending, there is a clear consensus that the behaviour is hurtful, unacceptable, and must stop. Children and
other adults must be protected and individuals must find strategies to prevent the behaviour from reoccurring.
Finally, adults with intellectual disabilities can embrace their sexuality every bit as fully as everyone else in society. Knowing this, seeking ways to ensure these adults have the knowledge they need can become a priority.

Increasing clients’ expressions of their sexuality in healthy ways will allow others to see their capabilities and
personalities as people we value and want to come to know.

CHAPTER 1: SUPPORT WORK: THE FUNDAMENTALS

Guiding Principles for Support Work
Key Points for Caregivers
Guiding principles for support work state that people with disabilities have rights that relate to
1. citizenship, through freedom from discrimination
2. individual control, through involvement in decisions related to their lives
3. equality and human rights, through the benefits and protection of the law
4. universal design, through barrier-free environments.
“To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity.”
— Nelson Mandela

Historical Struggles
Key Points for Caregivers
In the past, people with disabilities were rejected, laughed at, and even put to death. Today, disability
services emphasize the importance of including people with disabilities in communities. Social role valorization encourages communities to provide normal living, education, and employment opportunities
whenever possible. Rosa’s Law requires that the term mental retardation is replaced with the term intellectual disability.

Competencies Expected of Support Workers
Key Points for Caregivers
Caregivers who support individuals with disabilities, particularly caregivers who are employed as direct
support workers, are expected to be competent and able to work with others to
1. assess the strengths and needs of clients
2. plan and provide services
3. link to resources
4. advocate
5. record information and write reports
6. demonstrate professional and ethical behaviour
7. tailor support requirements in relation to unique requirements of clients

CHAPTER 2: WHAT'S IN A NAME?

The Impact of Names Beyond the Hurt Feelings: Implications for Service and
Support
… Language to AVOID
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Avoid describing persons with intellectual disability as all the same. For example, avoid using the
word the, as in the intellectually disabled, when talking about individuals with intellectual disability.
This form of description treats persons with disability as objects and interferes with recognizing each
person’s uniqueness.
2. Avoid referring to individuals as particularly remarkable or interesting because they are persons
with intellectual disabilities. Language that sets individuals or groups apart as somehow special or
unusual because of their disability actually reduces their value as human beings. This includes praising someone as brave or courageous, simply because that person has an impairment.
3. Avoid using language that expresses pity for a person with disability or for their family. For example, avoid comments such as “It’s just so unfair (or “What a shame” or “What a pity” or “How
awful”) that your son has to live with such a disability.”
4. Avoid polite terms or language that is vague and confusing. Though some terms sound sensitive,
such as differently abled or developmentally challenged, those terms only indicate that a disability
exists. They do not actually identify the disability
5. Avoid using language that labels a person with intellectual disability as someone who suffers from,
is a victim of, or is afflicted with the disability. These descriptions give negative suggestions about
the person with the disability.
6. Avoid using language that describes persons with intellectual disabilities as having lower status.
For example, by describing persons without disabilities as normal, individuals with disabilities are
suggested to be abnormal. This can suggest that persons with disability are not good enough to
belong to the preferred group, normal.

CHAPTER 2: WHAT'S IN A NAME? • 101

The Impact of Names Beyond the Hurt Feelings: Implications for Service and
Support
… Language To USE
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Use language that is respectful, caring, and kind, and that communicates that the person is valued.
2. Use language that is appropriate to age and culture. For example, when meeting an older adult, a
common custom may be to use a greeting such as: “I am pleased to meet you Mr. Dodge. May I call
you Henry?” rather than presuming that Mr. Dodge can be called Henry simply because he has intellectual disability.
3. Use language that is preferred by the person living with the disability. For example, members of
the People First self-advocacy organization in Great Britain prefer to say that they experience “learning difficulties” instead of saying that they have intellectual disability, or a learning disability.
4. Use the person’s name and discuss issues in the same way that you would discuss issues when
talking with or talking about someone who does not live with intellectual disability.
5. Treat each person as a person first, and with the understanding that using diagnostic labels is
required only rarely and only in highly specific situations.

CHAPTER 3: AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Thinking: Schizophrenia
Key Points for Caregivers
1. With schizophrenia, all those who care for verbal clients must try to know the content of any hallucination or delusion their client is experiencing or has experienced. A typical hallucination might
involve a deep, loud commanding male voice repeatedly telling a client that he or she is “worthless and
must die.” Caregivers are expected to pose a clear question, such as “Are you hearing voices right now?”
when clients are talking to themselves.
2. Caregivers of non-verbal clients must try to determine if hallucinations or delusions are occurring.
Indicators of hallucinations include
a. Staring to the side and nodding and making hand motions as though listening to a conversation
others do not hear.
b. Physically attacking an unseen other person.
c. Staring with an angry or frightened expression at strangers or well-liked companions, in a situation
that does not require those emotions.
d. Covering the eyes or ears as if to protect oneself, when threats are not present.
e. Frowning as though something smelled or tasted foul.
f. Dressing in protective ways such as wrapping on extra scarves or blankets when the weather does
not require it.
3. The nature of schizophrenia prevents the client from understanding that the voices or other hallucinations or delusions are not real. The only treatment that is effective in decreasing the thought changes
in schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. Without medication, trying to orient clients to reality can
bring on profound anxiety and even aggressive actions. Caregivers must know what psychiatric medications have been prescribed.
4. The major side effects of psychiatric medication are a further challenge to treating schizophrenia. Hallucinations and delusions often include the belief that antipsychotic medication is poison. In response
to this belief, psychotic clients frequently pretend to swallow pills, or cheek. Given this unchangeable
reluctance to swallowing pills, clients often receive long-acting antipsychotic medications intra-muscu-

102

CHAPTER 3: AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 103

larly during monthly clinic visits. However, caregivers must always watch clients swallow their psychiatric medications.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Thinking: Psychosis
Key Points for Caregivers
1. With psychosis, determine whether clients know that fantasy conversations are not real.
2. Rule out dehydration, particularly in clients who are elderly.
3. Ask whether the client has been having seizures or has a seizure disorder.
4. Note whether a new medication or new medical condition is present.
5. Document any street drug use, as many drugs induce psychotic-like behaviour.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Thinking: Dementia
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Keep records of changes in behaviour and loss of previous abilities. This is especially important to health care workers diagnosing dementia. Therefore, maintaining clear records of how clients
function throughout their adult life is useful. These records can be formal medical charts obtained
from physicians, or they can be informal records obtained from family members or clients themselves. Scrapbooks, photo albums, video home movies, and audio recordings will illustrate how
clients spoke, moved, and responded when they were well and healthy. Comparing a previous picture, audio, or video with a current cell phone capture of a client can clarify changes that are happening.
2. Record specific examples of physical weakening, particularly in speaking and walking. For
example, identify how a client’s gait or how they walk is changing. Keep a record of any falls, stumbles, or times when clients seem to lose their balance.
3. Prepare for and seek medical help immediately if seizures occur. A seizure in someone previously unaffected, and that is not part of a medical condition, can indicate dementia.
4. Understand and identify how often confabulation answers are occurring. Confabulation
means making up answers without intending to lie. Knowing that clients with dementia are not
lying or making things up on purpose can help caregivers understand that this behaviour is part of a
psychiatric disorder and not acting-out behaviour.
5. Understand and identify how often sundowning is occurring. Sundowning means increased

104 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

agitation in the evening. Clients may seem to be expressing anger by behaviours such as screaming
and yelling, but it is important to understand that this behaviour is likely a response to an intense and
constant inner fear that clients are unable to escape.
6. Create and communicate supports that help memory lapses. People with dementia are forgetful, get lost, and can have difficulty recognizing friends, family, and staff. Whenever possible, create
cues to help with memory loss, such as calendars of events, photo collections, or scrapbooks. Ensure
that these cues are consistent and that as many people as possible in the client’s life know about
them.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Mood: Vegetative Shift
Key Points for Caregivers
Vegetative shift is a term used by mental health professionals to describe problems associated with depressive disorders. A vegetative shift occurs when vegetative signs shift or change. Critical vegetative signs
include affect, energy, pleasure, appetite, sleep, and thoughts of suicide. A memory aid for indicators of
vegetative shift is “A E P A S S.”
Use the “A E P A S S” (Affect, Energy, Pleasure, Appetite, Sleep, Suicide) memory aid to document
a shift in vegetative signs.
• “A” – an Affect of sadness and poor concentration. Identify sad facial, postural, and emotional
responses that last for weeks at a time and that do not seem to fit the context. Sadness in clients may
or may not be a response to something that has happened. Clients may show their depression through
crying, becoming withdrawn and non-responsive, or becoming agitated and verbally and physically
aggressive.
• “E” – Energy loss and fatigue. Write down the number of times clients are refusing to leave their
beds, take care of activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing, and attend work or leisure
activities. Include times when either constipation or incontinence occurs in relation to lacking the
energy to go to the bathroom. Include the number of hours clients spend sitting or lying down for
long periods of time just watching TV or doing nothing.
• “P” – Pleasure or interest. Notice whether clients are no longer taking pleasure in activities they
once enjoyed. Notice also when clients with a bipolar disorder are cycling into a manic or hyperactive state, when they may carry out pleasurable activities impulsively. In particular, monitor reckless
behaviour in spending money and sexual activity.
• “A” – Appetite changes. Appetite can increase or decrease in depressive disorders. Carefully record
client weight and identify any gains or losses. Tantrums at meals, and stealing or hoarding food for
constant nibbling, can reflect a need to soothe the emotional distress of depression. In contrast,
refusing to take time to eat can reflect the hyperactivity associated with a manic state.
• “S” – Sleep disturbances. Keep a record of the number of hours clients sleep each night, including
the time they go to bed, the number of times they get up in the night, and the time they wake up. Dif-

CHAPTER 3: AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL ILLNESS • 105

ficulty falling asleep can be an indicator of anxiety. Waking up early can be an indicator of depression. Sleeping in late can be a response to dysthymia, where people feel sad in the morning but then
feel better as the day progresses. Remaining in bed and sleeping or dozing for long periods of time
during both night and day can be a way of withdrawing that is often associated with depression. In
contrast, going to bed late, getting up frequently in the night, and getting out of bed early can indicate a pattern of hyperactivity associated with a manic state.
• “S” – Suicidal thinking. Ask verbal clients if they have thought about taking their own life, if they
have a plan to do so, and what (if anything) stops them. Assess if clients seem to speak often about
death when such discussions are out of context. Probe whether the thinking behind self-harming
behaviour is related to an intent to commit suicide. Important: Remove any objects that could be
used for self-harm.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Mood: Anxiety, Post-traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD)
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Monitor sleeping and identify whether nightmares are occurring. When possible, identify what
the nightmares are about.
2. Record situations when clients seem fearful, particularly when there does not seem to be anything or anyone around who could hurt them. Notice if clients avoid certain situations or individuals
by verbal and non-verbal resistance and behaviours.
3. Provide records of known traumatic events to caregivers and family members. Exchange information about these events to distinguish whether they are new traumas or flashbacks.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Mood: Anxiety, Obsessive-compulsive
Disorder (OCD)
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Delay rather than interrupt ritualistic behaviours. Expect that clients may respond with
aggression when re-directed away from their repetitive behaviours. When caregivers view the behaviours through the eyes of clients, caregivers can acknowledge a client’s belief that these behaviours
are the only possible relief from unbearable anxiety.

106 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

2. Prepare for and seek medical help immediately if seizures occur, particularly if clients have or
have the potential for seizure disorders and are taking the antidepressant medication clomipramine
(also called Anafranil).
3. Make comfort measures available when ritualistic behaviours result in physical symptoms.
For example, hand lotion for excessive hand washing, and padding or helmets for head banging.

Indicators Associated with Disorders of Behaviour: Borderline Personality Disorder
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Gather as much information as possible about clients’ patterns of over-reacting and behaviour
that is harmful to self or others. Identify if the patterns began occurring at a young age and whether
any elements of the behaviour have changed and improved over time and with support.
2. With borderline personality disorder, consistent communication among caregivers is critically
important. Divisions among caregivers can occur if clients split or view individuals around them
only as all good or all bad.

CHAPTER 4: COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS

Health Status
Key Points for Caregivers
Those who support and care for persons with intellectual disability can get clear signals from findings of
research with Special Olympic athletes.
1. Arrange routine vision and hearing examinations, particularly for age-related deterioration. Adults
with Down syndrome are particularly likely to have vision and hearing problems. Those over the age
of thirty are at increased risk for early development of cataracts, refractive errors such as near- and
far-sightedness, and degeneration of the cornea.
2. Encourage healthy dietary habits and promote or provide regular daily dental hygiene. Schedule
routine dental appointments for cleaning, examinations, and maintenance of oral health. Individuals
with intellectual disability are much more likely than individuals without disability to report that
they have not had their teeth cleaned by a dental hygienist within five years, or that they have never
had their teeth cleaned by a dental hygienist.
3. Promote or provide proper foot care, ensuring that cleanliness is maintained, nails are correctly
cut, and clean socks and properly fitting shoes are worn. It’s been said that to determine how well a
person with disability or dependency needs is being cared for, check the condition of his or her teeth
and toenails. Although this form of assessment is far too simplistic, it does provide a telling measure.
4. Provide well-balanced meals and regular weight-bearing exercise such as walking to promote
overall health and bone maintenance. Individuals with Down syndrome as well as underweight or
small-boned individuals are more at risk of bone loss and osteoporosis. Also at risk are individuals
who experience delayed puberty or early menopause, which can be part of some conditions linked
with intellectual disability.

108 • SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES & MENTAL ILLNESS

Factors Affecting Health Status
Key Points for Caregivers
People with intellectual disability have the right to be as healthy as anyone else. They also have the right to
the same health care access and treatment as others within the general population. Examples of legislation
that protects the equality rights of all persons with disability are section 15 of the 1982 Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms, the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, and Britain’s 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. In addition, the 2006 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is
a declaration of commitment to equality rights that has now been ratified by 143 countries.

Common Health Challenges: Constipation
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Prepare or promote the preparation of well-balanced meals that include adequate sources of fibre
such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grain breads.
2. Encourage adequate fluid intake. Eight glasses of water or other fluids each day can be considered
adequate, unless an individual has fluid intake restrictions or other requirements. Caffeine-containing drinks have a dehydrating effect and milk or dairy-based drinks may be constipating for some
people.
3. Promote or provide regular daily exercise. For individuals in wheelchairs, occasional side-to-side
movement, if possible, or exercise while seated in the chair may be helpful. A physiotherapist may
be able to recommend exercises and activities.
4. Encourage supported individuals to move their bowels when they feel the urge.
Medical assistance should be sought
1. if constipation is experienced for the first time or there has been a change in bowel routine
2. if constipation does not respond to natural remedies such as increased dietary fibre or fluid intake,
or to replacing sedentary activity with regular exercise such as walking or swimming
3. if blood is evident in stool or during bowel movements, or rectally at any other time
4. if unplanned weight loss occurs
5. if pain occurs with bowel movements, or abdominal pain or cramps occur
6. if nausea or vomiting occur
7. if constipation lasts for more than two weeks.

CHAPTER 4: COMMON PHYSICAL CONCERNS • 109

Common Health Challenges: Epilepsy
Key Points for Caregivers
1. Be conscious of situations and conditions that are likely to trigger seizures for supported individuals. Avoid or reduce exposure to triggers whenever possible.
2. Provide appropriate assistance to the individual if a seizure does occur.
3. After a seizure, record the conditions under which the seizure occurred, along with a description
of the seizure activity. Describe how long the seizure lasted and emergency measures if needed.
Describe any events that accompanied the seizure, such as loss of bladder control or injury. Describe
the nature of the recovery after the seizure.

Common Health Challenges: Mistreatment
Key Points for Caregivers
The foundation to providing appropriate support is respect for the right of individuals with intellectual
disability to make informed choices and decisions about their own lives. Informed choices and decisions
mean that people make their decisions based on a full and adequate understanding of all available options
and their possible consequences. For supported persons with intellectual disability, it also means that they
are able to discuss choices with people who are important to the decision and who genuinely have the best
interests of the supported person in mind. When more severe disability exists, others must make decisions
based on how they understand the supported person’s wishes and values, still in the genuine best interests
of that person.

Health Promotion
Key Points for Caregivers
Men and women with intellectual disability often lack the skill and opportunities to independently practice
healthy living. Support providers and health care professionals are important to maintaining and improving
health of people with intellectual disability through healthy living practices. This means that it is important for support providers and health care professionals to locate or develop best practice health promotion
programs and then apply those programs. This gives persons with intellectual disability the same opportunities to live healthy lives as other citizens.

2. Search for potential causes
3. Observe behaviours
4. Obtain proxy reporting
5. Attempt trial of pain medication

111

CHAPTER 6: BEHAVIOUR THAT HURTS

Overview of Applied Behavioural Analysis
Key Points for Caregivers
People may hurt themselves (called self-injury) or other people (called aggression). Self-injury or aggression may occur because of pain, a health-related disorder, stress, as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder,
or because a person lacks social skills. Medications may even make the problem worse. These possibilities
must all be investigated. Challenging behaviour that starts for one reason may continue even when that
reason is no longer there. Behavioural analysis looks at what needs are served by a behaviour and then
finds other ways that people can meet those needs.

Functional Behavioural Analysis
Key Points for Caregivers
Functional behaviour analysis helps us understand why people continue injuring themselves or being
aggressive. Three common reasons for any behaviour are that it:
1. provides an escape from something a person does not like
2. provides access to something a person does like
3. provides stimulation that a person can create when they are alone.
When people need to escape from an activity that is difficult or unpleasant, providing a break may help.
When they need access to something they value, such as favourite people, food, or activities, providing this
access before challenging behaviour begins may prevent the challenging behaviour from occurring. When
people are alone and need stimulation, they can be given alternatives through opportunities for them to see,
hear, smell, touch, and taste.

112

CHAPTER 6: BEHAVIOUR THAT HURTS • 113

Topography of Behaviour
Key Points for Caregivers
Challenging behaviours must be described and reported in detail so that others have a clear picture of what
people are actually doing. Topography of behaviour, like topography of a geographic area illustrated in
a map, describes only what is there and what we see. Topographies of behaviour do not judge value or
include expectations.

Strategies to Help Decrease Self-Injurious and Aggressive Behaviour
Key Points for Caregivers
Strategies to help decrease self-injurious and aggressive behaviours provide individuals with alternative
ways to meet their needs.
1. When people need to escape difficult situations, strategies can prevent escape, can offer instruction to
make the situation less difficult, or can offer an alternative way to escape.
2. When people want access to stimulation they like, such as food, activities, or attention from people,
strategies can make these people and things available. Strategies can include
a. card reading or saying “Help please” or “Break please” as an alternative to aggressive or self-injurious behaviour
b. presenting fewer or less difficult tasks for the individual to complete
c. breaking down larger or complex tasks into smaller steps
d. providing help and prompts to the individual at regular and ongoing points of time, only reducing
help when the individual shows that he or she has mastered the skill independently
3. When people want stimulation for their senses when they are alone, strategies can offer comparable
ways to experience the sensations and feelings. An example of a strategy is substituting appropriate food
treats to provide alternate sensations experienced during hand mouthing.
a. regular scheduled praise from a caregiver, such as ‘Good job not …’ when challenging behaviour
does not occur within a specified period of time
b. providing preferred items for the individual to interact with instead of engaging in challenging
behaviour.

CHAPTER 7: SEXUALITY

Discussion Topics for Sexual Education Support
Key Points for Caregivers
Sexual health is often overlooked in individuals with intellectual disabilities. They are very vulnerable to
sexual abuse and may not understand what consenting to sexual activity means. They may not know how to
express their sexuality. Sex education programs often include important discussions of normal expressions
of sexuality such as masturbation, relationships, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, and safe sex
practices. These kinds of topics must also be part of the everyday conversations that take place between
intellectually disabled individuals and the people in their lives. When individuals with intellectual disabilities are parents, they need a network of people around them and opportunities to learn about children’s
development and showing appropriate affection to children.

Understanding Boundaries and Providing Resources
Key Points for Caregivers
Establishing boundaries in relationships can create safe psychological spaces. When individuals with an
intellectual disability express their sexuality in inappropriate ways, their behaviour needs to be addressed
just as it would be with non-disabled individuals. Open demonstrations of sexuality may be linked to
mental illnesses and must be reported and discussed with other staff and health professionals. In some
instances, the behaviour must be reported to police. Caregivers can model respectful behaviour that shows
the difference between private and public actions. This is an important way for individuals with intellectual
disability to learn about setting boundaries. Resources are available, such as picture cards and the Circle of
Relationships activity.

114

CHAPTER 7: SEXUALITY • 115

Differentiating Between Challenging Behaviours and Sex Offending Behaviours
Key Points for Caregivers
Inappropriate expressions of sexuality are very serious. Whether they are open or violent, they can traumatize victims and leave offenders facing lifelong consequences. Different professional groups do not all
agree on the best treatment approaches. Some view sexually violent behaviours that hurt others and interfere with quality of life for others as challenging. Others view these behaviours as sexual offending. Treatment approaches that view the behaviour as challenging will try to find out why individuals act this way,
what the behaviour means, and how it meets an otherwise unmet need. When caregivers are involved, they
will admit that the behaviour is unacceptable and hurts others as well as themselves. They will also recognize that the behaviour is occurring for a reason and they will guide individuals toward meeting their needs
with more acceptable behaviours.
Treatment approaches that view the behaviour as sexual offending will not focus on what the behaviour
means. Here, when caregivers are involved, they will still admit that the behaviour is unacceptable and
hurts others as well as themselves. However, they will pay more attention to strategies that prevent the
behaviour from re-occurring and to protecting all the people in the community that the individual interacts
with.
Although views about treatment approaches are different and each individual is unique, inappropriate
expressions of sexuality must all be reported, discussed, and addressed as a team.
