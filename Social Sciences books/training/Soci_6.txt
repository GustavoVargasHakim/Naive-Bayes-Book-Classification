A Note to Students

If you are a student, you may be reading this book because
you are enrolled in:
• IELI 2470—Cross-Cultural Perspectives, or perhaps
• IELI 2475—Cross-Cultural Explorations
These courses are designed to fulfill General Education
breadth requirements in social sciences at USU (Utah State
University). As the USU Catalog states:
General Education breadth requirements are intended to
introduce students to the nature, history, and methods of
different disciplines; and to help students understand the
cultural, historical, and natural contexts shaping the human
experience.

The title of this book is Speaking of Culture and its purpose
is to define culture and many other concepts associated
with it. My hope is that the readings in this book will help
you to better understand the breadth of the concept of

speaking of culture | vii

culture and provide you with a vocabulary for discussing it
more articulately.
Culture is one of those broad concepts that is used
widely, although somewhat imprecisely, in everyday
English. It also cuts across many academic disciplines, and
this book draws on many of them. It touches, for instance,
on anthropology, biology, history, mythology, political
science, psychology, and sociology.
This book will not be the only material you will study
in IELI 2470/2475. Your professor may provide you with
additional readings and/or encourage you to do
independent research on topics of interest. You may watch
culturally relevant movies or documentaries. You will, I
hope, also have grand conversations with your peers.
My name, by the way, is Nolan Weil. I have been a
professor in the Intensive English Language Institute
(IELI) since 2004 and have taught this course or similar
courses many times over the years. Perhaps I will be your
teacher for this course, or perhaps you will have another
professor from IELI. If I am your teacher, you will get to
know me better as we meet regularly face-to face
throughout the semester. If I am not your teacher, you may
know me perhaps only as the voice behind this text.

Introduction

Suggested Focus
This introduction to the book will give you a brief survey of the topics
covered in each chapter. Identify two chapters that you think might be
particularly interesting. Why do you think so? Be prepared to discuss your
choices with other readers.

The word culture is among the most frequently used words
in English. We use it frequently in daily speech and
encounter it often in both popular and academic texts.
Directly or indirectly, it is the subject matter of many
university courses. Even when it is not the exclusive focus,
it plays a role in many discussions across the humanities
and social sciences. But most of the time, we use it without
defining it or even thinking much about exactly what we
mean by it.
Despite the ease with which we use the term, culture is
speaking of culture | 1

not a simple concept. The primary purpose of this book
is to promote a better understanding of the scope of the
idea. Indeed, the word has a very wide range of meanings,
and they are not all consistent with one another. For one
thing, it has a relatively long history, and its primary uses
have changed markedly over several centuries. Even in my
lifetime (I was born in 1953) the ways in which scholars have
defined culture have only become more diverse.
To come to grips with culture then will require that we
give an account of the various ways that culture has come
to be defined. It also goes without saying that one cannot
define any concept without introducing still other
associated concepts, so this book is rich in such secondary
concepts.
We begin our mission of defining culture in Chapter 1
with a brief recounting of the history of the word. We point
to its Latin root and recount the senses attached to it in 18th
century France, and later, in 19th century England, before
20th century anthropologists made it a central concept of
their discipline. We round out the chapter by calling
attention to the proliferation of definitions of culture over
the last 50 years. We end by introducing seven themes that
Faulkner, Baldwin, Lindsley and Hecht (2006) have
identified as encompassing all of the most common ways in
which scholars have sought to define culture.
In Chapter 2, we put definitions of culture on the shelf
temporarily, and put on the hat of the physical
anthropologist. Our purpose is to emphasize the idea that
culture, as anthropologists originally conceived it, is
characteristic of the human species. That being the case,
we want to remind readers of the antiquity of our species
because it lays a foundation for putting human culture into
a historical perspective in the chapter that follows. We also
2|

want to shine a light on the relationship between human
diversity and geography and advance the argument that
“race” is, biologically speaking, a meaningless category.
Concepts such as those of race and ethnicity are often seen
as bound up with culture, but my hope is that readers leave
Chapter 2 with a sense that when it comes to humanity, the
only “race” is the “human race.”
In Chapter 3, we return to an explicit focus on culture,
defining it as a product of human activity. We learn that the
first modern humans came into a world already swimming
in culture. Their hominid precursors, for example, were
already tool users. The first half of the chapter features
a discussion of the material culture of the Paleolithic, a
time stretching from roughly 50,000 to 10,000 years ago.
You will no doubt marvel at the remarkable tools of stone,
bone, horn and ivory, and the various other artifacts that
are hard to describe as anything less than art. The second
half deals with the remarkable similarities in the world’s
mythologies, tracing their major themes back to Africa, and
proposing that a major innovation that took place roughly
40,000 years ago may have given rise to most of the world’s
mythologies as they have come down to us today.
Chapter 4 might best be regarded as a bridge from the
Paleolithic to the present. There is no grand theory in the
chapter and no technical terminology to master. It merely
begins with a quote from a renowned folklorist, who
declared that “Material culture records human intrusion
in the environment” (Henry Glassie, 1999: 1). Taking
inspiration from the quote and from Glassie’s descriptive
approach to material culture, I was moved to write a simple
homely narrative based on my travels across several
regions of the country. I caught hold of the first
impressions that came to mind when I recalled several
speaking of culture | 3

memorable travels. These recollections were of
waterscapes and landscapes, and the most obvious
intrusions were boats and buildings.
Structural definitions of culture often consist of lists of
elements that refer to products of thought (or those things
that can be expressed by means of language) and those
things which are recognizable primarily as actions (i.e.
performances, or ways of doing things). The intent of
Chapter 5 is to define a handful of terms that are generally
regarded as aspects of culture: beliefs, values, norms,
customs, traditions, and rituals. This certainly does not
exhaust the list of elements typically mentioned as integral
to culture, but they are terms that we routinely fall back on
when challenged to define culture. They are also terms that
we find difficult to differentiate. What, for example, is the
difference between a custom and a tradition? Although it
may be a fool’s errand, we will do our best to distinguish
this handful of interrelated terms one from another.
In Chapter 6, we take a closer look at several ways in
which anthropologists have put beliefs and values to work
in the service of cultural inquiry. We look at the theory of
Florence Kluckhohn and Fred Strodtbeck, known as Values
Orientation Theory, which proposes that human societies
can be compared on the basis of how they answer a limited
number of universal questions. We then summarize the
results from another approach to universal values, that of
Geert Hofstede, who has proposed a theory purporting to
identify different orientations across national cultures. We
contrast that with a Chinese Values Survey reflecting a
Confucian worldview. We wrap up the chapter with a
critique of Hofstede’s theory, motivated by a suspicion that
the persistence of the theory is due more to charisma than
to the veracity of the theory.
4|

Chapter 7 takes up the theme of culture as groupmembership, questioning the labeling of large national
groups as cultures on the grounds that few people in
today’s multicultural societies actually live in groups where
everyone shares the same culture. In other words, we
argue, culture is not something that is contained within
groups. We define some social categories often discussed
by sociologists including race, ethnicity and social class.
We then examine group-membership as historians and
political scientists have often discussed them through the
lens of nationalism.
We round out this ever so incomplete attempt to extend
our everyday, casual ways of speaking of culture by
inquiring into the roots of American culture. In Chapter
8, we call upon some of the elements of culture discussed
in Chapters 5 and 6, most obviously beliefs, values, and
folkways. But whereas Chapter 5 focused on defining the
terms in general, and Chapter 6 inquired into beliefs and
values as cultural universals, Chapter 8 inquires into the
particular beliefs and values of the United States. We start
with a conventional depiction of the United States as
exemplifying values such as individualism, freedom,
equality, and beliefs in change and progress, and as
embracing norms of competitiveness, informality, and so
on. Then we challenge that as perhaps too much of a
stereotype. Drawing on the “nation” concept from Chapter
7, we take a historical view of the United States as a country
of eleven nations all exerting regional influence, and four
dominant cultures dueling for political authority.
This book does not explicitly cover all of the seven
themes introduced in chapter one. There isn’t really much
about culture as process or culture as refinement. And
culture as power and ideology is only suggested in Chapter
speaking of culture | 5

8. However, perhaps there is enough here for every student
to gain some small measure of appreciation for the many
ideas we might want to keep in mind when speaking of
culture.

Chapter 1: What is Culture?

Suggested Focus
Here are some questions and some tasks to guide you in your reading of the
chapter. If you can address everything on this list, you will be off to a good
start.

1. What is the origin of the English word, “culture?”
2. How has the meaning of the word changed over time? Trace its
evolution from the 18th to the 21st century.
3. Contrast Sir Edward Tylor’s 19th century view of culture with that
of Franz Boas at the beginning of the 20th century. How are they
similar? How are they different?
4. What is the significance of Kroeber and Kluckhohn’s classic work
published in 1952?
5. List the seven themes that seem to capture the scholarly literature
on culture. Which theme(s) do you find most compelling?

speaking of culture | 7

History of the word
Scholars sometimes preface their definitions of culture by
recounting historical uses of the word. Jahoda (2012) has
noted that it comes originally from the Latin, colere,
meaning “to till the ground” thus referring to agriculture. It
was also used centuries ago in English when talking about
agricultural production, for example, “the culture of
barley.” Biologists use it in a similar way today when they
speak of preparing “cultures of bacteria.”
In 18th century France, says Jahoda, culture was thought
to be “training or refinement of the mind or taste.” In
everyday English, we still use the word in this sense. For
instance, we might call someone a cultured person if he
or she enjoys fine wine, or appreciates classical music, or
visiting art museums.
Still later, culture came to be associated with “the
qualities of an educated person.” Conversely, an
uneducated person might be referred to as “uncultured.”
Indeed, throughout the 19th century, culture was thought
of as “refinement through education.” For example, the
English writer Matthew Arnold (1896, p. xi) referred to
“acquainting ourselves with the best that has been known
and said in the world.” If Arnold were still alive today, he
would no doubt praise the person who reads Shakespeare
but frown on the one that watches The Simpsons or Family
Guy.

8|

Near the end of the 19th
century, the meaning of
culture began to converge on
the
meaning
that
anthropologists would adopt
in the 20th century. Sir
Edward Tylor (1871, p. 1), for
instance, wrote that:
Culture, or civilization … is that
complex whole which includes Sir Edward Tylor
knowledge, belief, arts, morals,
laws, customs and any other
capabilities
and
habits
acquired by man as a member of society.’’

Notice that Tylor viewed culture as synonymous with
civilization, which he claimed evolved in three stages. The
first stage, Tylor called “savagery.” People who lived by
hunting and gathering, Tylor claimed, exemplified this
stage. The second stage, “barbarism,” Tylor said, described
nomadic pastoralists, or people who lived by herding
animals. The third stage, the civilized stage, described
societies characterized by: urbanization, social
stratification, specialization of labor, and centralization of
political authority.
The elements Tylor identified with culture—knowledge,
beliefs, and so on—are certainly consistent with 20th
century views. However, anthropologists since the time of
Franz Boas tend to see culture as distinct from civilization.

speaking of culture | 9

Boas was born in Germany
and migrated to the United
States in 1896. Insisting
that the study of culture
should be based on
observation,
not
speculation, Boas spent
many
years
studying
Native American cultures.
Over the course of his
Franz Boas
career,
he
collected
volumes of information on
linguistics, art, dance, and
archaeology. Boas’ studies convinced him of the
sophistication of Native cultures, so in contrast to Tylor,
Boas and his students rejected the idea of indigenous
cultures as inferior to “Western” cultures. Today, Boas is
widely regarded as the founder of cultural anthropology in
the U.S. (Franz Boas, 2017)

A flourishing enterprise
Academic interest in culture exploded in the 20th century
and continues to resonate today. Scholars attempting to
master the growing literature usually begin with the classic
work of Kroeber and Kluckhohn who in 1952 reviewed over
160 definitions of culture that had been proposed by social
scientists until that time. And as if 160 definitions were
not enough, Kroeber and Kluckhohn went on to offer their
own:

10 |

Culture consists of patterns … of … behavior acquired and
transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive
achievement of human groups, including their embodiments
in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of traditional,
… historical … ideas and especially their attached values;
culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as
products of action, on the other as conditioning elements of
further action. (Kroeber & Kluckhohn, 1952: 181)

Since the time of Kroeber and Kluckhohn, scholars have
continually revisited old definitions while trying to invent
new ones. A recent analysis of the literature uncovered 313
definitions!

Seven contemporary themes in the treatment
of culture
One of the most ambitious attempts to survey written
definitions of culture is the work of Faulkner, Baldwin,
Lindsley & Hecht. The 313 definitions they found in the
academic literature revealed seven distinct themes. These
included definitions framed in terms of:
• Structure/pattern – culture as a system or framework of
elements (e.g., ideas, behavior, symbols, or any
combination of these or other elements)
• Function – culture as a means for achieving some end
• Process – culture as an ongoing process of social
construction
• Product – culture as a collection of artifacts (with or
without deliberate symbolic intent)
speaking of culture | 11

• Refinement – culture as individual or group cultivation to
higher intellect or morality
• Group membership – culture as signifying a place or group
of people, including a focus on belonging to a place or
group
• Power or ideology – culture as an expression of groupbased domination and power
(Faulkner, Baldwin, Lindsley & Hecht, 2006: 29-30)

Final reflection
Given so many themes, you might feel like agreeing with
Jahoda (2012: 299) who complained that:
more than half a century after Kroeber and Kluckhohn, and
a literature that could easily ﬁll a sizeable library, the most
striking feature of these deﬁnitions is their diversity.

You might also agree with him that many of the
definitions seem logically incompatible. Surely it is
inconsistent, for example, to say that culture is both a
system of beliefs or behaviors and at the same time a group
of people. One way to escape from this inconsistency is
to recognize that when we refer to a group of people as a
culture, what we are really saying is that the group shares
a particular system of beliefs and behaviors. I don’t know
whether we can easily escape from every inconsistency in
the same way. Nevertheless, we will follow the philosopher
Wittgenstein (1958: par 66) who said that the meaning of a
word is its use in language.

12 |

Since the word culture has so many uses in English, our
strategy in the chapters to come will be to investigate many
of these uses. In the process, we will also have to come
to a sharper understanding of many other terms often
associated with culture, and these terms, too, have multiple
uses that we will have to sort out. In the end, I hope the
pages that follow will help us better understand how to
put the word “culture,” as well as many closely associated
concepts, to good use as we explore our own cross-cultural
perspectives.

Application
FOR FURTHER THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION

Below are some excerpts of definitions from various sources, organized in
seven groups. Keep in mind the proposal of Faulkner, Baldwin, Lindsley and
Hecht that scholarly definitions tend to fall into one (or more) thematic
categories:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Structure
Function
Process
Product
Refinement
Group Membership
Power/Ideology

For each cluster of definitions below, name the category from above that
best describes the theme represented by the items included in the cluster.

Suggested Focus
There are several important arguments in this chapter. If you follow them
carefully, you may come away with all the necessary resources to address
the following questions and tasks.

1. What does it mean to say that human diversity is geographically
structured?
2. Explain the essential difference between the Multiregional Origin
Hypothesis and the Recent African Origin Hypothesis. How does
your previous understanding of human origins compare with these
explanations?
3. List at least three genetically determined traits discussed in the
chapter. Which two seem linked to geography and climate? Which
one might be due mainly to chance?
4. Explain the connection between geography, human nutritional
requirements, and skin color.
5. How has the concept of race changed since the time of Carl
Linnaeus?

Origins and Diversity of Humanity
Before exploring the concept of culture in greater depth,
we will take a brief look at humanity through the lens of
biological anthropology. Although we humans may not be
the only species to exhibit culture, we depend on it in a
way that no other species does. Moreover, human culture is
certainly as old as the human species itself. But how old is
that? And how do we explain human diversity? Finally, how
did our species come to be distributed across the whole
earth? We’ll take up all of these questions in this chapter.

20 |

Anyone who has ever visited an ethnically diverse city
like New York, London, Toronto, or Sydney, is surely
impressed by the diversity of people living in these cities.
These cities, and others like them, have attracted migrants
from every corner of the world. Noticing this diversity may
naturally make some of us curious. Where is this or that
person from? Or to be more precise, where are the person’s
ancestors from (for the person in question may be truly
from New York, having been born there and having never
lived anywhere else). Sometimes it is hard to guess from
a person’s appearance where his/her ancestors are from
originally. But sometimes it is not so hard. Where do you
suppose the ancestors of the people depicted below
probably originated?

Indeed, a person’s physical appearance can be a good
clue from where in the world the person’s ancestors came.
speaking of culture | 21

We see a person with a particular face, and we think —
India, while for others, we think — China, or Africa, or
Europe. Sometimes we can be even more precise—that
person looks Somali, we think (if we are familiar with
Somalis), while another we guess is an Eastern European
of some sort. Of course, we can be mistaken, but those of
us who have met people from many different places may
become quite good at guessing a person’s ancestral origins.
On the other hand, many people in the world today have
mixed ancestry, which complicates the point I am trying to
make. You may be wondering, “just what is that point?”
Only that humans exhibit a fair amount of genetic
diversity (for it is our genes that determine our physical
characteristics) and also that genetic diversity is
geographically structured, which is the geneticist’s way of
saying that people from particular regions resemble each
other more than they resemble people from other regions.
In the past, this observation led both laymen and scholars
to believe that people could be neatly classified into easily
distinguishable groups, called ‘races.’
Today, most biologists believe that (biologically
speaking) the only race is the human race. What does this
mean? Where did our respective ancestors come from in
the first place? Did our ancestral groups just spring into
existence independent of all other groups? Or is each group
a branch from the trunk of one great tree, which came from
a single seed? In other words, if we trace our ancestry back
far enough, will we discover that we really belong, not to
different regional tribes, but to one original tribe?
The academic discipline most intimately connected with
the search for answers to questions about human origins
is physical anthropology (also known as biological

22 |

anthropology). We thus begin our cross-cultural
explorations by first situating ourselves as a species.

Where did we all come from?
Scientific knowledge of
human origins is based on
the study of skulls and other
skeletal remains, most of
them unearthed in the 20th
century. In the last 30 years,
advances in molecular
genetics have also advanced
our knowledge. From this
material, anthropologists Artist’s depiction of Homo
erectus
infer that the first ancestors
we might be willing to
regard as fully human
appeared in Africa about 2 million years ago. We know
them as Homo erectus (“upright man”). We call ourselves
Homo sapiens (“wise man”), meaning that while we might
see these distant cousins as somehow human, we do not see
them as belonging to our species. But their exact
relationship to us has been a subject of debate over the last
half-century, as scholars have debated two competing
theories for explaining how human beings populated the
planet. Let’s look at these two theories.

The Multiregional Origin Hypothesis
There are many variations of the Multiregional Origin

speaking of culture | 23

Hypothesis, making it hard to construct a simple narrative,
but the basic story goes something like this.
As suggested above, Homo erectus, first appeared in Africa
about 2 million years ago. From fossil evidence, we guess
that some groups migrated out of Africa reaching
Indonesia, China, and Georgia about 1.7 million years ago.
Other groups may have wandered into Europe about 1.5
million years ago. According to multi-regionalists, (e.g.,
Thorne & Wolpoff, 2003), as Homo erectus spread across Asia
and Europe, they established separate regional
populations. These populations gradually evolved with
some gene mixing occurring when migrating groups
sometimes came into contact with one another. Multiregionalists propose that Homo erectus gradually evolved to
eventually become Homo sapiens. If this theory is correct,
say the multi-regionalists, it explains why Homo sapiens
appeared suddenly across Europe, Asia and Australia about
50,000 years ago.

The Recent African Origin Hypothesis
Not every anthropologist accepts the Multiregional Origin
Hypothesis. Supporters of the Recent African Origin Hypothesis
agree that various species of the genus Homo, including
Homo erectus first appeared in Africa and that some groups
migrated out of Africa. They doubt, however, that Asian
populations of Homo erectus gave rise to Homo sapiens.
Instead, they argue, there were many migrations of various
archaic humans out of Africa over 1.5-2.0 million years,
none of which gave rise to Homo sapiens. According to the
Recent African Origin Hypothesis, our immediate ancestors
evolved—perhaps from Homo erectus, yes, although not of
the world travelling Asian variety, but instead from those
24 |

Homo erectus who had remained, evolving, in Africa (Cann
& Wilson, 2003).
According to the Recent African Origin Hypothesis, our
closest ancestors originated in East Africa about 150,000
– 200,000 years ago and migrated out of Africa in several
waves beginning about 100,000 years ago. Some of these
waves may have died out. But one wave, which began about
90,000 years ago, carried early humans out of Africa,
possibly through present day Yemen. Over the next 15,000
years, groups of early moderns followed the coast of the
Indian Ocean, around the Indian subcontinent as far as
present day Indonesia and southern China. By about
65,000 years ago, some groups reached Australia, Borneo
and New Guinea. About 50,000 years ago, after the climate
in Europe began to warm following an Ice Age, some
groups moved north and east across the European
continent (Oppenheimer, 2003).

speaking of culture | 25

On these migrations,
Homo sapiens may have
encountered
various
hominid cousins, including
Homo
neanderthalensis
(Neanderthal man). Some
geneticists believe modern
humans may carry a small
amount
(~2.5%)
of
Artist’s depiction of Neanderthal Neanderthal DNA (Green, et
Man
al., 2010). Otherwise there is
not much evidence of
interbreeding
between
moderns and archaic humans. Eventually, all
representatives of the genus Homo other than Homo sapiens
disappeared; we do not know exactly why.
About 40,000-45,000 years ago, modern humans began
spreading north throughout Asia. Then beginning about
25,000 years ago, some groups crossed over a Bering land
bridge from Siberia to Alaska. Gradually, over the next
10,000 years, these migrants from Asia spread throughout
all of North and South America. Of course, not everyone
left Africa. Some descendants of groups that left may have
even returned. We do not know all of the details, but over
the past 30 years, a lot of evidence has been discovered
that supports the Recent African Origin hypothesis
(Oppenheimer, 2003). Today, it is probably fair to say, it is
the consensus view among anthropologists although few
would say the matter is completely settled.
If the Recent African Origin theory is correct, it means
every living human being can trace his/her ancestry to
Africans who left Africa roughly 90,000 years ago. In other
words, there is a fundamental sense in which deep down
26 |

we are all African, and ultimately as different as we may
seem to be, we are all one big family.

But why do we all look so different on the
surface?
If our ancestors all came from Africa, you may be
wondering, why do we all look as different as we do? To
answer this question, we have to draw on principles from
evolutionary biology and population genetics.
To survive, a species must be well adapted to its
environment. Some species occupy a very narrow
geographic range; we say it is specialized. Feder and Park
(1993, p. 328) give as an example the koala, which lives only
in Australia and eats primarily the leaves of eucalyptus
trees. Koalas do not exhibit much variation. Other species,
however, are generalized; they inhabit a wide range of
environments and exhibit a greater degree of variation. We
humans are an example of a generalized species. We
inhabit environments from the tropics to the arctic, from
deserts to rainforests, and from sea level to high
mountains. Many of the traits we possess are therefore
polymorphic, that is they exist in many different forms,
which allow us to adapt to a wider range of environments.
One trait that shows great variation in humans is skin
color. If we look at a map showing the distribution of skin
color across the world today, we find that darker skin is
concentrated near the equator while lighter skin is
concentrated in the northern latitudes. If the recent
African origin theory is correct, our earliest modern human
ancestors had evolved in Africa for about 100,000 years
before leaving on their journeys to the far ends of the earth.

speaking of culture | 27

Those ancient ancestors were most certainly black, having
evolved in the intense equatorial sun.

Global human skin color distribution

Black skin is a natural sunscreen and therefore good
protection against sunburn and skin cancer, but that is
probably not the reason our African ancestors evolved dark
skins. More important may have been a connection
between skin color, ultraviolet radiation (UV), and an
important vitamin. According to Jablonski & Chaplin
(2010), dark skin is the body’s way of preserving folate
(Vitamin B), which is rapidly destroyed by UV radiation
leading to folate deficiency, a major cause of birth defects,
developmental disorders, and various degenerative
diseases (Lucock et al., 2003). Light skinned people would
not have thrived in such an environment; therefore, the
frequency of genes for light skin would have been greatly
reduced or eliminated from the gene pool.
When the earliest migrations out of Africa took humans
around the coast of India, the selective pressures (with
regard to skin color) remained the same. Indeed, people
indigenous to southern India tend to be quite dark. But as
human populations moved northward, selective pressure
for dark skin diminished. In fact, populations in the
28 |

northern most latitudes encountered a different kind of
adaptive challenge. Adequate Vitamin D synthesis requires
exposure to UV radiation. Humans in the northern
latitudes needed to absorb all the UV light they could for
Vitamin D synthesis. Since white skin allows in more UV
while dark skin filters it out, populations that settled in
the north underwent selection for white skin. Dark skinned
people in the far north would have suffered from rickets, a
bone disease caused by Vitamin D deficiency. The fact that
some northern people (like the Inuit) are darker than we
would expect is explained by their diet of fish and marine
mammals, which is rich in Vitamin D. Because the Inuit got
adequate Vitamin D from their food, they did not depend
on sunlight for Vitamin D synthesis and so did not face
selective pressure for lighter skin.
Populations that settled in the middle latitudes (between
23° and 46°) evolved yet another adaptive trait. In the
middle latitudes, UV radiation varies greatly by season, so
people indigenous to the middle latitudes evolved white
skin with the ability to tan (i.e., become darker). In essence,
they could change their color considerably, becoming
several shades darker in summer, and getting pale again
with the winter. In the modern era, of course, people of
all colors have migrated, or been otherwise displaced, to
places not originally inhabited by their ancestors. Cultural
adaptations compensate for any environmental
disadvantages associated with particular skin colors. For
instance, white people in sun-drenched regions shield
themselves from UV radiation with clothing, and black
children in sun-deprived regions may drink milk, which in
places like the U.S. is routinely fortified with Vitamin D.
Body build is another trait that may have undergone
selection. People like the Maasai of Kenya, who live in a hot
speaking of culture | 29

climate, are often long limbed and slender, which promotes
heat loss. People like the Inuit (mentioned above), who live
in a cold climate, are often stocky with short fingers and
toes, a body build that helps preserve body heat. Similarly,
people whose ancestors settled in cold or dry areas often
have long noses to warm or moisten the air before taking it
into the lungs. People whose ancestors stayed in hot humid
places (where the air is already warm and moist) have noses
that are short and broad.
So one explanation for human physical variation is
natural selection, which is the idea that the environment
(e.g., geography and climate) selected particular traits and
not others. Why? Because those traits enabled the
individuals that possessed them to reproduce more
successfully and therefore to pass these genetically
determined traits to their offspring. As our African
ancestors settled in different regions over tens of
thousands of years, they gradually acquired physical traits
well suited to their environments. They began to look more
and more like the people that today we would tag as Indian,
and Chinese, and Northern European, and for that matter
African too.
But while natural selection shapes the physical
characteristics of populations, random processes also play
a role. Gene flow and genetic drift are random processes that
also surely affected our ancestors on their global
migrations. For much of human history, humans lived in
small, geographically separated groups of interbreeding
individuals. Sometimes, different populations came into
contact and interbred. When this occurred, there was gene
flow, or the mixing of genes between two populations. Gene
flow served to reduce the genetic variation between

30 |

interbreeding groups. Physical differences between the
groups became blurred as a result of mixing.
On the other hand, sometimes a population may have
split into two or more groups, each of which went its own
way. This led to genetic drift. Especially when populations
are small, chances are that the frequencies of particular
genes in populations that split will be quite different. For
example, it is not likely that the (many) genes that control
height will be equally distributed when a relatively small
population splits into two groups. One group may retain
more of the genes that contribute to a taller stature, and
after several generations, the average height of one group
will tend to be greater than that of another (Feder & Park,
1993).
In conclusion, nearly 100,000 years of migrations have
shaped from an original population of Africans an
assortment of regional groups differing phenotypically
from each other in ways shaped by geography, climate, and
chance. At the same time, Africans themselves have also
continued to evolve. Today Africa remains the continent
with the greatest amount of genetic (and linguistic)
diversity anywhere on the earth, further lending support to
the idea that it all started in Africa.

Race is not a biologically meaningful concept
The topic of race is a sensitive one because race is
historically tied to issues of inequality and oppression that
still trouble us today. But what is race? Simply stated, race
involves the idea that humans can be classified into a few
basic groups based on genetic and physical traits, ancestry,
or social relations. Today scholars think of race as a folk

speaking of culture | 31

concept, not a scientific concept although once upon a time,
the concept was treated with great scientific authority.
It is true that most groups tend to classify other groups
in relationship to themselves. A group with limited
knowledge and experience of another group living nearby
may merely create a simple category that distinguishes the
in-group from the out-group. For instance, the Abenaki
who inhabited the northern regions of North America, and
referred to themselves as Alnôbak, “real people,” referred
to their neighbors in the arctic as Eskimo, “eaters of raw
flesh,” or so it is widely believed. Meanwhile, the ‘Eskimo’
called themselves Inuit, or … you guessed it, “real people.”
Each group thought of itself as “real people,” while they
thought of the other group as, well, perhaps not real people.
On the other hand, complex societies with considerable
knowledge of other people may produce elaborate systems
of classification. It is often said that Europeans had no
particular awareness of race until the 1700s; however, a
variety of cultural documents from the European Middle
Ages show that during the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries,
Europeans were already creating a discourse of race even
before the development of an explicit vocabulary of race
(Heng, 2011).
Europeans had, of course, long been familiar with the
peoples of Africa and the Middle East. But from the
15th-18th centuries, Europeans also began to encounter
many of the world’s other peoples for the first time,
especially in the Americas, Australia and the Pacific
Islands. These encounters along with the rise of science
set the stage for the development of scientific attempts to
explain human diversity, and the concept of race became a
subject of scientific interest.
Scientists such as the Swedish botanist, physician and
32 |

zoologist, Carl Linnaeus, laid the foundation for a scientific
racism that would last well into the 20th century. In 1735,
Linnaeus invented a system for classifying living
organisms that would greatly influence European ideas
about race. Linnaeus classified humans into four racial
types based on skin color and facial and bodily features.
He named the types after their assumed place of origin,
associating each type with a color: Africanus (black),
Asiaticus (yellow), Americanus (red), and Europeaeaus
(white). He even described behavioral traits he thought
distinguished each race. While biologists still regard the
Linnaean system as useful for classifying living organisms
generally, modern biologists eventually rejected Linnaeus’
classification of humans by racial type (Jandt, 2016, pp.
9-10).
For centuries though, racial classification was
considered scientifically legitimate. Moreover, Europeans’
embrace of scientific racism assured them of their own
racial superiority. From the 16th to the mid-20th century,
scientific racism made it easy for Europeans to justify their
colonial domination and exploitation of indigenous
populations in North and South America, Africa, the
Middle East, South Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands.
The history of nations in the ‘New World,’ from the United
States to Brazil, is still tarnished by the legacy of black
slavery, justified by a theory of race reinforced by the
science of the day. Unfortunately, even after slavery was
finally ended, racist assumptions continued, casting a long
shadow over the lives of the descendants of enslaved
peoples.
In the mid to late 20th century, Western nations began
the slow and painful work of confronting and redressing
racial injustices of the past. Biologists, working with the
speaking of culture | 33

benefit of advanced technologies, particularly in the field
of genetics, began to realize that the centuries old theory
of race was genetically incoherent. Today, the scientific
consensus is that while human diversity is undeniable,
traditional systems of racial classification have no
biological basis (Feder & Park, 1993).
Nevertheless, it is difficult for many people to accept that
when we think we see people of different races, we are
deceived. To understand how this is so, we should realize
that despite the visibility of a few (genetically determined)
traits, humans vary (genetically) in many other ways that
are not visible. And if we are going to find a genetic basis
for race, we should look at all of our genes, not just the ones
that result in a few visible traits. For a theory of race to have
any genetic basis, geneticists should be able to find large
groups of people that are genetically homogeneous within
their group but heterogeneous with respect to contrasting
groups. This is just not the case. A tremendous amount of
genetic variability is actually shared among supposed racial
groups, and genetic variation between individuals of the
“same racial group” is sometimes greater than the genetic
variation between individuals of two “different racial
groups.” In other words, geneticists are not able to find
any non-arbitrary way to draw boundaries around groups
(Marks, 2010).
But surely, some people may still argue, the fact that one
person’s skin is as black as mahogany while another’s is
almost as white as snow is evidence of some typological
difference. Indeed, skin color, in particular, continues to
be a salient feature for many, even if they agree that skin
color is just one trait among many. For any reader that is
not persuaded by the arguments against the reality of race
articulated above, Relethford (2009, p. 21) has suggested
34 |

that comparing traits such as skin color to height might
help us understand the problem better. Borrowing from
Relethford’s argument, we might note, for instance, that
like skin color, height too is a continuous variable. In other
words, people come in all sizes from very short to very tall
and everywhere in between just as people come in many
different shades of color. In daily conversation, we may use
crude labels such as ‘‘short,’’ ‘‘medium,’’ and ‘‘tall,’’ but do we
think that these represent three precisely defined groups.
In most places in the world, 198 cm would certainly be tall.
But how about someone who is 218 cm. Suddenly, we might
feel the need for a new category—“very tall.” And where
exactly should we draw the line between tall and very tall:
207 cm, 208 cm, or 207.5 cm? And how many categories
would we feel we needed to cover people of every height?
Relethford’s point is that we know that the labels we use
in everyday life are subjective and imprecise, but no one
thinks that terms like ‘‘short,’’ ‘‘medium,’’ and ‘‘tall’’ refer
to discrete groups, and that human beings comes in only
three, or five, or seven varieties of height.
In the end, Relethford says:
Race is a crude ﬁrst-order approximation to human biological
variation that is arbitrary in terms of the number and
deﬁnition of races. As such, race may not provide the best way
of describing or analyzing human variation.

This does not contradict what we have said earlier, that
human variability is geographically structured, and that
based on a person’s appearance, we can often guess at the
geographical origins of his/her ancestors. But that is not
the same thing as saying that the person in question

speaking of culture | 35

belongs to some genetically coherent category that one
could call a race. In the end, there is only one race, the
human race.

Final Reflection
Although socially constructed concepts of race do not
appear to rest on firm biological foundations, race will no
doubt continue to occupy a prominent place in the social
and political discourse, especially in countries with colonial
legacies or histories stained by slavery and racial injustice.
And scientific or not, the social construction of race is often
a basis for the formation of identity, although whether that
identity can in every instance be legitimately called a
cultural identity is another matter for debate.

Application
FOR FURTHER THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION

1. Now that you have finished reading Chapter 2 what is your
response? What was familiar to you? Did anything surprise you?
2. How was the origin of humans explained in the community where
you grew up? Was there more than one explanation?
3. How much attention do people where you are from pay to skin
color? Is skin color seen as a basis for differentiating people in any
way? If so, how?
4. What is the writer’s point of view on race? Do you find it
persuasive? Why or why not?

Chapter 3: Origins of
Culture

Suggested Focus
This chapter is full of details. The questions and tasks below will help you
pick out the most important ones. Of course, main ideas are important as
well. As you pick out details, be sure to ask what it all adds up to.

1. Identify two ways in which human culture differs from the
culture-like behavior of other animals.
2. List all of the tools named in the chapter. Identify the material they
were made from and their use. Identify a major innovation in tool
making that increased the effectiveness of single tools.
3. Make a list of all the objects that we moderns might regard as art.
Indicate their place of discovery, material, and a notable fact about
each item.
4. Explain the bold new theory of Michael Witzel. In what way does
Witzel’s theory draw on ideas from Chapter 2?

speaking of culture | 41

Culture as a product of human activity
Once upon a time, social scientists regarded humans as
the only species to exhibit culture. But if language and tool
use are both signs of culture, we must acknowledge that
other species may also possess some rudiments of culture.
Whales and dolphins, for instance, may have some capacity
for language. And chimpanzees have been observed
making tools, “fishing rods” so to speak, for retrieving
termites from their nests. Bottle-nosed dolphins also
appear to be tool-users. They have been observed to break
off pieces of sea sponge and use this in order to probe for
fish along the sea bottom. Ethologists have even observed
that some species of songbirds, and some species of fish
too, exhibit “socially learned cultural traditions” (Mesoudi,
2011: 195-196).
However, no other species demonstrates the cultural
virtuosity of human beings. For one thing, the cultures of
non-human species do not seem to evolve from one
generation to the next, as human culture does. Moreover,
cultural innovation by the combining of two or more
separate elements into entirely new tools or practices does
not seem to occur among non-humans, whereas it is a
hallmark of human cultural evolution.
In the last chapter, we placed humanity in a biological
context. If the Recent African Origin theory is correct, we
said, our earliest ancestors came from Africa and spent
90,000 years migrating to every habitable continent on
earth. Along the way, they assumed a variety of different
regional appearances. But as they migrated to geographic
and climatic regions that sometimes differed from the
lands of their ancestors, they met new environmental
challenges. New environments required the invention of
42 |

new tools and new ways of doing things. In turn, the
continual evolution of culturally transmitted knowledge
and skill enabled people to become ever more able to thrive
in new environments.
In this chapter, we return to our story of human
migrations out of Africa and across the globe. This time,
however, we will focus on the origins of culture. As you
read, keep in mind the seven themes introduced in Chapter
1. In this chapter, we shall frame culture as a product of
human activity. But be on the lookout for other themes
that may enter the discussion, in particular themes that call
attention to functions and processes.

Paleolithic material culture
Our knowledge of pre-historic culture is limited. We can
only guess at the beliefs and the daily social interactions
of early humans. Our most concrete knowledge of prehistoric culture comes from the discoveries of
archaeologists who have uncovered many material objects
buried with the skeletal remains of early humans. And
these objects are limited to those made of materials able
to withstand the natural forces of decomposition. Among
the most plentiful objects are tools, the most important of
which seem to have served the purpose of securing and
processing food. To the casual modern observer, the tools
seem rough and unsophisticated. However, careful study
of them suggests that their creation required careful
planning, detailed knowledge of various materials, and
skillful craftsmanship.
To convince yourself that the knowledge and skill of early
humans is deserving of admiration and respect, imagine
the following scenario. You (and a group of friends) are
speaking of culture | 43

dropped off in a pristine wilderness, naked, and with none
of the tools or materials you now take for granted. (OK,
you may have some matches since it is almost certain you
would not know how to start a fire without them.)
All around you is everything you need to survive: rock,
wood, edible plants and animals. How will you get food?
How about some clothing? You probably will not even know
what plants you can eat. You might have some idea what
animals you could eat. Suppose, by some miracle, you
secure a fish, or a rabbit, perhaps a deer. What will you
do with it? With no metal knives, you will have to reinvent
stone blades for skinning and cutting up the deer. Stone
blades will also be your best bet for scraping the deerskin
to make leather for clothing. Good luck (unless you already
know something about stone tools).
Of course, the exercise imagined above is clearly unfair.
If you had been born in the Upper Paleolithic (say 40,000
years ago), you would have been born into a group of people
who already had all the necessary tools for hunting,
skinning, butchering, and everything else necessary for
survival. You would have grown up under the watchful eye
of people who knew how to make and use the tools. You
probably would have learned by watching and doing, and
those more skillful than you would have guided you
(Barham, 2013).
When our ancestors left Africa 90,000 years ago, they
already possessed technologies for exploiting the
environment. At that time, our people, Homo sapiens, were
not the only cultural species in the world. Our close cousins,
Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis were still around,
and there is evidence that both of them knew how to
control fire. They were makers and users of tools as well.
Even the much earlier Homo habilis may have been a
44 |

toolmaker. Maybe even Australopithecus. Many of the tools
that Homo sapiens used had already been in use for over
2 million years. In other words, our ancestors came from
a long line of hominid species that survived by means of
cultural know-how. So our ancestors ventured forth out
of Africa with the best (Stone Age) technology of the day.
Encountering new environments and new needs, they
refined those tools and developed new ones too (Brown,
1990).
Archaeologists refer to the time between 50,000 and
10,000 years ago as the Upper Paleolithic. It was a
remarkably creative period of human cultural evolution
(Feder & Park, 2007). Let’s have a look now at some of the
material culture typical of the Upper Paleolithic.

Stone tools
Stone tools were among the most important early tools.
Items like the ones shown below enabled early humans to
secure protein rich diets. Hammerstones and hand axes
were the oldest stone tools in the ancient

speaking of culture | 45

human “toolkit.”
Hammerstones were used for smashing animal bones to
get the nutritious marrow inside (“Stone Tool Technology,”
2015). Hammerstones were also used to manufacture sharp
stone tools such as hand axes, and a wide variety of other
stone blades and projectile points. Toolmakers used a
technique known as knapping. By striking a hard
sedimentary rock, such as flint, a toolmaker fractured the
stone to create a sharp edge. By carefully chipping the
edges of the entire rock, the knapper created large hand
axes and various smaller blades of stone. Hand axes and
blades were used for jobs like cutting meat, scrapping
animal skins to make leather for clothing, and for carving
or whittling wood (“Stone Age Tool Makers,” 2010; “Stone
Tool Technology,” 2015).
A major innovation involved the insight that blades could
be attached to shafts and handles. We call this technology
hafting. For example, a projectile point, such as the one
shown above, was attached to a long, straight shaft,

46 |

fashioned from an appropriate tree branch. This involved
considerable knowledge of materials and design. The shaft
had to be notched to create a slot to insert the projectile
point. A sticky material needed to be added to help hold
the stone projectile point in place. This required some
knowledge of natural glues and how to get them, e.g., the
resins of tree bark, or bitumen from tar pits. The point
also had to be tightly bound to the shaft. This was usually
done with strips of leather or sinews. Toolmakers learned
that if the leather was soaked in water, and tightly wrapped
around the point and shaft, the leather would shrink as it
dried, creating a very tight wrap, holding the point firmly
in place (Barham, 2013).

harpoons, and sewing needles. Of course, materials like
stone and bone remain long after other types of materials
have decomposed. The animal skin clothing, for instance,
is long gone even though the needles used to make it can
still be found. And speaking of clothes, early humans were
not so busy with survival that they had to neglect fashion.

Bone Needles

Carved Figurines
In a sense, our species simply improved upon the tool
making traditions of earlier hominids. On the other hand,
as far as we know, we were the first to create objects of
art. Carved figurines are found in abundance in the Upper
Paleolithic. Examples include items like the Löwenmensch,
found in a cave in Germany. The Löwenmensch, carved
from wholly mammoth ivory, is about 35,000-40,000 years
old (“Lion-Man,” 2017). The “Venus of Dolní Věstonice,”
(2017) depicting a nude female was found in the Czech
Republic. It is the oldest known ceramic figurine at about
25,000-30,000 years old. More well-known perhaps is the
“Venus of Willendorf,” (2017), discovered in Austria. Carved
out of limestone, it is about 27,000-29,000 years old. In fact,
many figurines resembling, in form, these Venus figurines
have been discovered, so many that we could regard the
artifact as an Upper Paleolithic meme. The “Venus of

48 |

Brassempouy,” (2017), made of ivory and discovered in a
cave in France, is one of the earliest realistic
representations of a human face. It is about 25,000 years
old. Notice the hairstyles on the Venuses. Don’t they
suggest that hairstyling is a thoroughly ancient cultural
practice? (“Great Human Odyssey,” 2015).

Painting
Painting too is an ancient achievement. There is evidence
of it in every part of the world. Perhaps the oldest and most
remarkable paintings are those that have been discovered
in caves in France and Spain. Particularly awesome are the
30,000-32,000-year-old paintings discovered in the
Chauvet-Pont-d’Arc Cave in France. In the interest of
preserving and protecting the site, the cave is no longer
open to the public, but today, tourists can visit a facsimile
of the cave, where full-scale replicas of the paintings are on
display. The museum faithfully reproduces the ambience of
the cave its silence, darkness, temperature, humidity and
acoustics (“Chauvet Cave,” 2017).

Hundreds of animals of at least 13 different species are
depicted with astounding realism. The paintings have a
3-dimensional quality that suggests movement, and some
animals are even depicted interacting, for example, wholly
rhinoceroses butting horns. Of course, we do not know
what the artists of the Upper Paleolithic thought about
their painting. Was it simply an expression of aesthetic
sensibility? Or was it connected with ritual and magic
intent, as some interpreters have suggested? There is
more to know about the material culture of the Upper
Paleolithic than we can summarize here. There is evidence,
for instance, that the first musical instruments may have
emerged at that time. Indeed, flutes made of bone and even
ivory, some as old as 40,000 years, have been discovered in
caves in southern Germany (Conard, Malina & Münzel,
2009).
In conclusion, with the tool use of Paleolithic humans,

52 |

we see cultural continuity with the hominids that came
before us. But we see a dramatic evolution of culture in
Homo sapiens beginning about 40,000 years ago with the
rise of art and music. Homo sapiens turned the corner
towards becoming fully modern in more than just
anatomy. If culture is defined as “refinement,” it was surely
in full swing in the Upper Paleolithic.

Origins of mythology
While some products of human activity can be classified
as material culture, other products are non-material. Stone
tools, for instance, that remain long after their creators are
gone, are obviously material. Music, on the other hand, is
ephemeral. We suppose, quite reasonably, that flute music
drifted through the valleys of Ice Age Europe only because
we have found flutes, and where there were flutes (a
material product), there must have been music (a nonmaterial product). Was there also spoken language? There
is certainly no good reason to doubt it. Then how about
stories? Music and stories would be examples of cultural
products that are non-material.
If anything, storytelling may be more ancient than
painting, sculpting, and music. Even more surprising is
that just as all humans may have come from an original
population of Africans, there may have also been a single
African source for all of our collective creation myths.
Creation myths are stories that seem intended to answer
the deepest curiosities that we humans seem to harbor. On
the surface, at least, these myths pose answers to questions
such as:

speaking of culture | 53

• Where did this world in which we find ourselves come
from?
• How did it arise?
• How did we humans come to be here?
• What will become of us?
In this section, we’ll summarize a remarkable piece of
scholarship by Michael Witzel (2012) on the origins of the
world’s mythologies. Witzel’s work was inspired, in part,
by the Recent African Origin hypothesis. In brief, Witzel
claims that when humans left Africa, they did so telling a
particular story about the origins of the world, (today we
would call it the universe). The story told of the beginnings
of the earth and everything in it, as well as the sky above. It
included a recounting of the appearance of generations of
humans, and it ended with a final destruction.
But before we examine Witzel’s ideas about the origin of
world mythology, let’s sample some of the creation stories
of various peoples around the world.

Stories of creation – A sampling
In the beginning, neither heaven nor earth had names.
Apsu, the god of fresh waters, and Tiamat, the goddess of
the salt oceans, and Mummu, the god of the mist that rises
from both of them, were still mingled as one. There were no
mountains, there was no pastureland, and not even a reedmarsh could be found to break the surface of the waters.
It was then that Apsu and Tiamat parented two gods, and
then two more who outgrew the first pair. These further

54 |

parented gods, until Ea, who was the god of rivers and was
Tiamat and Apsu’s great-grandson, was born. Ea was the
cleverest of the gods, and with his magic Ea became the
most powerful of the gods, ruling even his forebears.
Apsu and Tiamat’s descendants became an unruly crowd.
Eventually Apsu, in his frustration and inability to sleep
with the clamor, went to Tiamat, and he proposed to her
that he slay their noisy offspring. Tiamat was furious at
his suggestion to kill their clan, but after leaving her Apsu
resolved to proceed with his murderous plan. When the
young gods heard of his plot against them, they were silent
and fearful, but soon Ea was hatching a scheme. He cast a
spell on Apsu, pulled Apsu’s crown from his head, and slew
him. Ea then built his palace on Apsu’s waters, and it was
there that, with the goddess Damkina, he fathered Marduk,
the four-eared, four-eyed giant who was god of the rains
and storms.
Enuma Elish – Babylonia, 1100 BCE in writing; possibly existed
from c. 1800 BCE, (Creation Stories from Around the World)
***
There was neither “being” [sat] nor “nonbeing” [asat] then,
nor intermediate space, nor heaven beyond it. What turned
around? Where? In whose protection? Was there water?
—Only a deep abyss.
There was neither death nor immortality then, nor was
there a mark of day and night. It breathed, windless, by
its own determination, this One. Beyond this there was
nothing at all. Darkness was hidden by darkness, in the
beginning.

speaking of culture | 55

A featureless salty ocean was all this (universe). A germ,
covered by emptiness, was born through the power of heat
as the One. Desire arose then in this (One), in the
beginning, which was the first seed of mind. In “nonbeing”
the seers found the umbilical cord [relationship] of being,
searching (for it) in their hearts with planning. Obliquely
stretched out was their cord.
Was there really “below”? Was there really “above”? There
were the ones bestowing seed, there were “greatnesses”
[pregnancies]. Below were their own determinations,
above was granting.
Who then knows well, who will proclaim here, from where
they have been born, from where (came) this wide
emanation? Later than its emanation are the gods. Who
then knows from where it developed?
From where this emanation developed, whether it has been
created or not—if there is an “overseer” of this (world) in
the highest heaven, he alone knows it—or (what) if he does
not know?
Rig Veda – India, c. 1000 BCE, (Witzel, 2012: 107)
***
Verily, at first Chaos [void] came to be, but next widebosomed Earth, the ever sure foundation of all … and Eros
(Love), fairest among the deathless gods… From Chaos
came forth Erebus [darkness] and black Night; but of Night
were born Aether and Day, who she conceived and bore in
union with love from Erebus. And Earth first bore starry
heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side.

Theogony – Greece, c. 700 BCE, (Witzel, 2012: 108)
***
In the beginning the Elohim made the sky and the earth,
but the earth was shapeless and everything was dark. The
Elohim said “Let there be light,” and there was the light that
made day different from night. And that was the first day.
The Elohim said, “Let there be a dome to separate the
heavens from the waters below,” and there were the
heavens. And that was the second day.The Elohim said, “Let
the waters of the earth gather so that there are seas and
there is dry land,” and so it was. The Elohim said, “Let there
be vegetation on the land, with plants to yield seeds and
fruits,” and so it was. And that was the third day.
The Elohim said, “Let there be light in the heavens, and let
them change with the seasons,” and so there were stars.
Then the Elohim made a sun and a moon to rule over the
day and to rule over the night. And that was the fourth day.
The Elohim said, “Let there be creatures in the waters, and
let there be birds in the skies,” and so there were sea
monsters and sea creatures and birds. The Elohim blessed
them, saying “Be fruitful and multiply”. And that was the
fifth day.
The Elohim said, “Let the earth have animals of various
kinds”, and so it was. Then the Elohim said, “Let us make
humans after our own likeness, and let them rule over the
fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over the cattle and
creeping things of the land, and over all the earth.” The
Elohim said to these humans, “Be fruitful and multiply, and
fill the earth and subdue it, ruling over the fish and the
speaking of culture | 57

birds and the animals of the land. We have given you every
plant and tree yielding seed. To every beast and bird of the
Earth we have given every green plant for food.” And that
was the sixth day.
And on the seventh day the making of the heavens and
earth was finished, and the Elohim rested.
The Elohim – Hebrew, c. 600 BCE, (Creation Stories from
Around the World)

In a time when Heaven and Earth still were without form,
was called the great beginning. The tao began in the great

And at once the moving earth lay stretched abroad.

***
The first world was Tokpela [Endless Space].
But first, they say, there was only the Creator, Taiowa. All
else was endless space. There was no beginning and no end,
no time, no shape, no life. Just an immeasurable void that
had its beginning and end, time, shape, and life in the mind
of Taiowa the Creator.
Then he, the infinite, conceived the finite. First he created
Sótuknang to make it manifest, saying to him, “I have
created you, the first power and instrument as a person, to
speaking of culture | 59

carry out my plan for life in endless space… Go now and
lay out these universes in proper order so they may work
harmoniously with one another according to my plan.
Sótuknang did as he was commanded. From endless space,
he gathered that which was to be manifest as solid
substance, molded it into forms, and arranged them in
nine universal kingdoms: one for Taiowa the Creator, one
for himself, and seven universes for the life to come…
Hopi – Arizona, compiled in 1950s, (Waters & Fredericks, 1977)

Similarities among creation stories
Upon first reading, the stories may seem quite different.
But perhaps you noticed that beyond the differences in
style, and in particular details, the basic theme is the same.
Each myth, for instance, begins in much the same way. The
world comes into existence out of chaos, formlessness, and
darkness. Or, in some cases, out of primordial sea. At first,
the world comes about not by an act of creation, but as an
emergence, an emanation.
Some accounts are more abstract and philosophical. The
passage from the Rig Veda, for instance, begins in
philosophical abstraction making the distinction between
“being” [sat] and “nonbeing” [asat]. Moreover, it remains
reflective, never quite becoming something the reader can
easily visualize. (If you need to be convinced, please read it
again.)
Other accounts, like the Babylonian Enuma Elish or the
Greek Theogony portray the emergence of the world using
more sensual, anthropomorphic images. However, the
60 |

basic theme is the same. You may have noticed in many of
these stories that powerful beings, such as gods, come only
after the world has emanated out of the void:
• Apsu, the god of fresh waters, and Tiamat, the goddess of the
salt oceans, and Mummu, the god of the mist that rises from
both of them, were still mingled as one. There were no
mountains, there was no pastureland, and not even a reedmarsh could be found to break the surface of the waters. It was
then that Apsu and Tiamat parented two gods, and then two
more who outgrew the first pair. (Enuma Elish)
• Later than its emanation are the gods. (Rig Veda)
• … at first Chaos [void] came to be, but next wide-bosomed
Earth, the ever sure foundation of all … and Eros (Love), fairest
among the deathless gods… From Chaos came forth Erebus
[darkness] and black Night… (Theogony)
And notice how many of the narratives emphasize the
emergence of mind or a primordial consciousness arising
out of the void:
• Desire arose then in this (One), in the beginning, which was the
first seed of mind. (Rig Veda)
Sometimes this emergence is characterized in terms of
breath or breathing:
• The Tao began in the great emptiness… Then “breaths” were
born from space and time. (Huainan Zi)
Breathing, or mind are sometimes characterized as coexistent with the void:
• Io dwelt within the breathing space of immensity. (Maori)
speaking of culture | 61

• There was no beginning and no end, no time, no shape, no life.
Just an immeasurable void that had its beginning and end,
time, shape, and life in the mind of Taiowa the Creator. (Hopi)
In some versions of the story, the qualities of the material
world are sometimes brought into existence by an act of
imagination:
• Then he, the infinite, conceived the finite. (Hopi)
In other versions, the qualities of the world are brought
about by an act of speech:
• And he began by saying these words—That he might cease
remaining inactive: “Darkness become a light-possessing
darkness.” And at once light appeared …etc. (Maori)
• … but the earth was shapeless and everything was dark. The
Elohim said “Let there be light,” and there was the light that
made day different from night. (Hebrew)

Accounting for common motifs
What do we make of these worldwide similarities? Are they
simply coincidental? Scholars of comparative mythology
have proposed several possible theories.

62 |

1. Diffusion
One theory is that
individual motifs
spread outward
from an early
civilization, such
as
Egypt
or
Mesopotamia to
the older hunter
and
gatherer
cultures living on
Witzel has hypothesized that the Laurasian
the frontiers of
myth complex originated in Southwest Asia
the empire. These
tribal
peoples
then adopted the
“parent” myths and developed their own local variations of
the myth based on their own local experiences.
Witzel acknowledges that some religious mythologies, e.g.,
Judeo-Christian-Islamic and Buddhist are known to have
spread regionally in this way. However, he notes that the
many myths continue according to a complex sequence of
episodes. In literature, we would call this a plot. Witzel
questions whether an entire myth complex could really
successfully spread worldwide across such great distances
to end up as far away from the early centers of civilization
as South America and the Pacific Islands.

2. Myths as universal features of human
psychology
Other scholars see myths as expressions of universal
speaking of culture | 63

patterns of human thought (Campbell, 1949; Jung, 1953).
According to this theory being human naturally involves
universal experiences: of human relationship, of
nurturance, of struggle for survival, of conflict, of passing
through life stages, of death, and so on. Moreover, humans
evolved as language using and concept-forming animals,
and as creators of symbolic forms of expression. As a result,
certain thoughts and images arise spontaneously in human
imagination by virtue of our common humanity.
Supporters of this theory suggest that the motifs expressed
in myths arose independently in many different places
around the world because human experience, out of which
the mythical imagination arises, is similar everywhere. But
the myths differ in specific details because the imagery is
also influenced by local geography and history. (Hmmm, a
kind of Multiregional Origins hypothesis?)
Witzel agrees that humans may be biologically structured,
with the kind of brain that produces similar images in
people everywhere. However, he argues, it is hard to believe
that the motifs would be organized everywhere into the
same long, elaborately structured tales. Instead, Witzel
offers a third explanation.

3. Creation myths all arose from a single (very)
ancient source
Witzel has argued that an original mythology sprang up
in ancestral Africa. From there, it was told and retold by
our ancestors as they began their global migrations out of
Africa 90,000 years ago. Ah-ha, the Recent African Origin
hypothesis applied to mythology. Witzel’s argument is
64 |

quite persuasive and seems to be supported by major
discoveries over the last 30 years in linguistics, population
genetics, and archaeology.
Based on extensive study of the themes and storylines
across mythologies all over the world, Witzel has identified
two classes of myths. He calls these two types Gondwana
and Laurasian. Of the two, the Gondwana type appears to be
older and less elaborately developed. Gondwana mythology
is still found today among people in sub-Saharan Africa,
and in Melanesia, Australia, and the Andamanese Islands.
Laurasian mythology is found across Europe, Asia,
northern and eastern Africa and the Americas. (Witzel
hypthesizes an even earlier, Pan-Gaian mythology,
ancestral to both the Gondwanan and Laurasian but doubts
that we have the means to learn very much about it.)
Witzel thinks the Laurasian myth probably diverged from
the Gondwana myth at least 40,000 years ago, originating
somewhere in southwestern Asia, before spreading to
northern and eastern Africa, Europe, northern and eastern
Asia, and eventually throughout the Americas. If Witzel is
correct, Laurasian mythology thrived long before the great
early civilizations and the major religious traditions of the
world. In other words, the world’s mythologies did not
spread outward from the great civilizations. On the
contrary, the first great civilizations (including those of
Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and China) adopted oral
traditions that were already tens of thousands of years old
by the time these early civilizations arose. Today we engage
with Laurasian mythology when we study the literature of
classical civilizations. And many of the motifs are still

speaking of culture | 65

discernable in the great religious traditions of today, in
Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

The Laurasian “Novel”

Pangu

66 |

Witzel

The Laurasian Novel

characterizes Laurasian mythology as a sort of first novel.
By this he means that the creation myths found among
people everywhere in the world all seem to be variations on
one basic plot as shown in the sidebar. Although particular
elements may be minimalized or missing in some myths, or
more elaborately developed in others, the basic storylines
are remarkably similar. The Laurasian novel begins with
the primordial creation, the earth emerging finally out of
chaos, darkness, or water. In versions where the earth
emerges out of water, an “earth diver” pulls the earth up out
of the sea. In some versions, the earth comes out of a great,
cosmic egg (for example Pangu in Chinese mythology).
In some versions, the earth is formed when a giant who
existed before the world emerged is killed and carved into
pieces and whose body parts become the heavens and earth
(Pangu again, or Ymir in Norse mythology, and Kronos in
speaking of culture | 67

Greek mythology). In many creation myths, the earth is
closely associated with the idea of a Great Mother and in
many myths is personified by woman. At the same time, the
sky makes an appearance as the counterpart of the earth,
and the idea, the image, of a Sky Father is born.
Interestingly, in the Egyptian relief from the Book of the
Dead of Nesitqnebtashru (below), the usual arrangement
is reversed. The sky is the goddess, Nut (held up by the
air god, Shu, and two ram-headed deities). The Earth God,
Geb, reclines beneath. Originally, however, Nut was
regarded as goddess of the nighttime sky, so this may
depict the situation at night, when the daytime sky is
overshadowed by the darkness of earth (Campbell, 1988,
cited in Witzel, 2012: 380).

Egyptian relief from the Book of the Dead of Nesitqnebtashru

68 |

But first in the imagination of
some early storytellers, the
father is laying with the mother
in sexual union and they must
be pulled apart. The sky is
pushed into place sometimes
by the children, the offspring of
the original parents. The theme
is illustrated (right) in a Maori
carving depicting the primal
couple,
the
earth
mother—Papa, and the sky
father—Rangui,
locked
Maori primal couple, Papa
together in a tight embrace.
and Rangui

Sometimes the sky is propped
into place by a world tree, or a
stone pillar, or a world mountain. The cosmos is beginning
to take the shape that we know. Now there is an earth and
sky, but it is often a watery earth, and so the early
storytellers must make provisions for the creation of dry
land.
In many myths, there is a demiurge, a being who must
form the whole of the material world, who must prepare
the world for habitation. The demiurge may come out of
the mind of a Supreme Being and be sent to build the world
and put into it all of the things, animate and inanimate.
The demiurge brings light to the world and sets the sun in
place. Once there is a sun and an alternation of day and
night, the earth is ready to support life. The earth then
receives moisture (water); in some traditions, there is the
slaying of a dragon and the earth is fertilized in its blood.

speaking of culture | 69

The demiurge, sometimes known too as a trickster, not
only prepares the world but brings human life into it as
well. The trickster also brings culturally important
elements to humans such as “fire” and “the heavenly drink,”
(i.e., alcoholic drink). But the creation of humans and many
of these cultural developments do not emerge until later
in the story, so as with any good novel, we can leave the
trickster, lurking in the background as we turn to the next
important chapter in our Laurasian novel.

The Fall of the Titans, oil painting by Cornelis van Haarlem
(1588–1590)

Back to the two original gods, Earth and Sky. Earth and Sky
produce children. These are the first gods and goddesses,
and the story progresses through an epic spanning four or
five generations of gods/goddesses and their exploits.
These are tales of conflict and treachery among the gods
but in the process the lands of the earth are laid out and the
70 |

earth is peopled. In some versions of the story an original
giant, sometimes one of the primordial gods is cut into
pieces, and scattered to form the dry land. Themes of incest
among the various gods or deities and continuing
competition and conflict dominate many versions of the
Laurasian novel. There is often warfare between two
groups of gods who sometimes agree to share power;
sometimes, defeated gods leave the inhabited center of the
world. In Greek mythology, for example, the younger
generation of gods, the Olympians, go to war with the older
generation, the Titans, to see who will reign over the
universe.
After several
generations
of
gods,
human
beings make
their
appearance
and the plot
follows the
succession of
noble
lineages of
humans. The
first humans
are
Huitzilopochtl, Aztec god of the sun
semidivine.
Across the
globe, from
Egypt and Mesopotamia and on to India, China, Japan, and
Polynesia, and into the Americas, there are stories of noble
speaking of culture | 71

lineages; often the characters in these lineages trace their
ancestry to a sun deity. A common feature of these stories
is that after one or two generations, the descendants of
the sun deity lose their immortality; i.e., humans become
mortal.
In some myths, there is a competing storyline though.
Many creation stories involve the creation of humans from
clay. In other stories humans come from trees, maize, an
egg, or a gourd. However, according to Witzel, this
particular storyline is more representative of Gondwana
mythology. Witzel surmises that Laurasian mythology is
intimately tied to shamanism—a male vocation—and that
when older Gondwana motifs find their way into the
Laurasia storyline, it may be because of the co-existence in
various cultures of “grandmothers tales,” motifs kept alive
through stories told by women.
A dramatic chapter in the story of humans comes after
humans have lived for many generations on the earth.
Somehow humans displease or anger a powerful being who
destroys most of humankind in a great flood. The
Laurasian saga then continues with the reemergence of
humans and there are many overlapping tales of heroes.
Some heroes are semidivine, and their exploits coincide
with those of the gods. Sometimes, there is an age of heroes
after the gods.
Finally, the Laurasian novel ends in a final destruction of
the world. Even the gods are destroyed. The Ragnarök in
Norse mythology is one of the most detailed stories of the
final destruction. Odin and Thor and all the major gods and
their adversaries, Fenrir, the wolf and the giant poisonous
serpent, Jörmungandr are all destroyed. The sun turns
72 |

black, the earth sinks into the sea, the stars vanish, steam
rises, and flames touch the heavens. After the destruction,
the world resurfaces new and fertile. Some surviving gods
return and the world will be populated anew by two human
survivors. The final destruction is thus paired with the hope
for a new, more perfect world. In many myths, the world
is created anew and there are a series of Four or Five Ages,
each age ending in a final destruction.

The Ragnarök in Norse mythology is one of the most detailed stories
of the final destruction.

Final Reflection
What does this discussion about an apparently very old
plot have to do with us today? Well if Witzel is correct,
the basic storyline of creation and human origins found in
both oral and literary traditions worldwide was “written”
a very long time ago, and we humans have been telling
various versions of this same story for over 100,000 years.
Following the stories of our own traditions back to their
earliest origins, we all find ourselves, perhaps, sitting in
the same circle. In this chapter, we have suggested that the
speaking of culture | 73

well-known creation myths found in the literature and oral
traditions from every corner of the world are a dramatic
reminder of the power of cultural transmission in shaping
the human imagination.

For Further Thought and Discussion

do you think are reflected (either explicitly or implicitly) in this

Chapter 4: Material Culture

Suggested Focus
This chapter is more impressionistic than the preceding ones. Don’t expect
to find answers to the following questions in the text. The best way to get
something from the chapter is to read yourself into the text.

1. In your own words, explain the point that Henry Glassie is making
in the quote that kicks off the chapter. Take it apart and explain
phrase by phrase with concrete examples that might illustrate
Glassie’s meaning.
2. This chapter discusses the differences (rather than the similarities)
in material culture from one region to another in the U.S. What are
some factors that seem to affect material culture?
3. How is material culture a reflection of the life of particular places?

The things we make
“Material culture records human intrusion in the
environment,” says Henry Glassie (1999: 1) in his book
speaking of culture | 81

Material Culture. “It is the way we imagine a distinction
between nature and culture, and then rebuild nature to our
desire, shaping, reshaping, and arranging things during
life. We live in material culture, depend upon it, take it for
granted, and realize through it our grandest aspirations.”
In many ways, material culture is the most obvious
element of culture. Of particular interest to the crosscultural explorer is the way that material culture changes
as one crosses otherwise invisible cultural boundaries. In
traveling from one place to another, it is often the visible
change in the manmade environment that first alerts the
traveler to the fact that she has crossed from one cultural
environment to another. This is not to ignore differences
one might notice in spoken (or written) language, or the
behavioral routines of people. There may be those too, of
course.

Taking to the road
Reflecting on Glassie’s characterization of culture as a
record of “human intrusion in the environment,” I am
reminded of my encounters with these intrusions in my
many travels–east, west, north, and south–across the
United States. Traveling by car in 1985 from my hometown
of Toledo, Ohio on the west end of Lake Erie through
Pennsylvania, upstate New York, Vermont, and New
Hampshire to the coast of Maine, I heard English
everywhere, of course. But when I arrived in Maine, the
accent of the natives was obviously different from my
northern Ohio, mid-Western accent. It amused me, for I
had previously traveled in the Deep South and was familiar
with the many accents of Southerners, but I had never
spoken with a native resident of Maine. However, what
82 |

impressed me more were the differences in cultural
landscapes.
In many respects, Maine was strangely familiar to me
although the geography is hardly the same as Ohio’s. Let
me explain. Northern Ohio is situated in a region of Ohio
known as the Lake Plains. Largely flat, much of northern
Ohio lies on the southern shores of Lake Erie, claiming
about 312 miles (502 km) of Lake Erie’s shoreline. On the
other hand, Maine, the northeastern most state of the U.S.,
is on the Atlantic coast and has a rugged, rocky coastline.
Both states have river systems that flow into large bodies
of water. The rivers of northern Ohio flow into Lake Erie.
The rivers of Maine flow to the Atlantic. Both states have
flourishing marine cultures. But it is not the geography I
want to focus on.
What struck me just as much as the differences in geography
werethedifferencesinthemarineculturesofOhioandMaine.Of
course,whethertravelingtheshorelineofLakeErieortheAtlantic
coast of Maine, one sees many boats. But my impression as a
travelerwasthattheproportionofboatsofdifferenttypesseemed
quitedifferent.
On Lake Erie one sees huge lake freighters, especially near big
industrialcitieslikeToledoandCleveland.

“As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most, with a crew and
good captain well seasoned” (song lyric from The Wreck of the Edmund
Fitzgerald

I am old enough to remember when the Edmund Fitzgerald

1975. It was subsequently immortalized by Canadian folk-rock
singer Gordon Lightfoot in a song called The Wreck of the Edmund
Fitzgerald.

Commercial fishing boats are also sometimes spotted in the
GreatLakestoo.Otherwise,theGreatLakesseascapeisdominated
by recreational craft. Powerboats seem most popular although
sailboatscanbeseenaswell. Marinas in Ohio are generally laid
out in a series of piers. Since there are no appreciable tides
in the Great Lakes, Lake Erie boaters can tie their boats at
docks near shore and walk right to them.

speaking of culture | 85

Marinas lining the shore of Lake Erie in Sandusky, Ohio

The impression is quite different along the Maine coast. Large
ships, while sometimes spotted, are more often seen only on the
distant horizon. On the other hand, commercial fishing is the
lifeblood of coastal Maine, and the lobster boat is an especially
commonsight.Isawthemeverywhere.

Lobster boat on Maine coast

There are many recreational boats too, and these certainly
include powerboats, but somehow powerboats do not dominate
my recollections of the Maine coast as they do that of Lake Erie.
Instead Sailboats seem somewhat more prevalent. And because
there are substantial tides along the Atlantic coast, boats are
anchored to the sea floor at some distance from shore rather than
tied to docks on the edge of the shoreline. A boat owner typically
needs to use a small rowboat (or dinghy) to get to the boat (unless
shewantstoswim). Oneisalsomuchmorelikelytoencounterasea

Heading Inland
Leaving the shores of Lake Erie and the coast of Maine
and traveling inland, both states quickly undergo a cultural
metamorphosis. We leave the vehicles and implements of
the sea behind and encounter those of the farm and small
town. In this sense, whether in Ohio or in Maine, one
moves from one cultural setting to another by traveling just
a few miles inland. But as we did with coastal Ohio and
coastal Maine, let’s compare a couple of material features
found in abundance in both rural Ohio and rural Maine.
Whether traveling across Ohio or Maine one cannot go
far without seeing a barn. Barns in both Ohio and Maine
are generally of two basic types. There are barns with
simple gabled roofs and gambrel style barns. Other shapes
are sometimes found as well, but the simple gable and the
gambrel are typical. Perhaps gambrel barns are more
numerous in Ohio than in Maine although I cannot prove
it. Barns are often painted red and sometimes white, or
maybe not painted at all. But whether red, white, or
unpainted, what is notable is that the siding on the barns
in Maine is sometimes nailed horizontally, while in Ohio,
the boards are often wider, and they are nailed vertically.
If there is a reason for these differences other than simple
local custom, I do not know. But it does not really matter,
for what concerns us here is the raw visual encounter.

Another obvious example of “human intrusion in the
environment” is the existence of houses (and other buildings:
churches, stores, government buildings, etc.) Houses in both
statescomeinmanystyles.Thewaysofbuildinginbothstateshave
been influenced by other regions, of course, and by historical
developments in architecture. This makes it hard to summarize
similaritiesanddifferencesinthewaysofbuilding.
But crossing Maine, the traveler will surely see an
abundance of variations on the simple, classic, cuboid
designs found throughout New England, including the
Cape Cod and the Saltbox.

Moreover, it would not be hard to find houses sided with
cedar shakes.

Cedar siding is common on traditional New England houses.

Nevertheless, except for differences in geography, it

speaking of culture | 93

might be hard for the traveler to tell from a casual
observation of houses whether she is in Ohio or in Maine.
And frankly, as an Ohioan, I would be hard pressed to name
the typical architectural style in Ohio. According to Zillow,
an online real estate database company, the most prevalent
architectural style in Maine is the Cape Cod design,
whereas in Ohio, it is Colonial. In this respect, Ohio
resembles Massachusetts or Connecticut more than Maine
does. Indeed, architectural preferences in Ohio are
somewhat more similar to those of New England generally,
than to those of other Midwestern states, such as
Minnesota or Nebraska (Home architecture, 2017).

For a more obvious contrast in American architectural

styles, the traveler can head south and west from Ohio,
down the Mississippi River to New Orleans where the
dominant building style is French.

Continuing west into Texas, the traveler begins to
encounter Spanish architecture. Further west still, in New
Mexico, the cultural landscape features an abundance of
buildings in the Native American Pueblo style. Perhaps
nothingcaptures thedifferencesbetween TexasandNewMexico
better than touring the campuses of the University of Texas, in
Austinandthe UniversityofNewMexico, inAlbuquerque.

While the Zimmerman Library at the University of New
Mexico was built in 1938, one finds examples of the
indigenous architecture that inspired it 60 miles west of
Albuquerque atop a 365-foot high mesa in the village of
Sky City in Ácoma Pueblo, home to the Ácoma people.
96 |

According to legend, the Ácoma people have lived there
since before the time of Christ. Archaeologists cannot be
certain of that but have confirmed that the site has been
inhabited since at least 1200 CE, making it perhaps the
oldest continuously inhabited community in the United
States (Minge, 2002).

Final reflection
So far, we have barely scratched the surface in pointing out
some architectural differences across broad regions of the
United States. Our purpose, however, is not to make an
exhaustive study of American architectural styles. It is only
to illustrate Glassie’s characterization of material culture as
“human intrusion in the environment” and to call attention
to the ways in which that intrusion differs according to
local customs, heritage, needs, and tastes.
Buildings are obviously large intrusions in the natural
environment, and we have not even begun to look at all
the various kinds of structures that comprise the built
environment from churches, synagogues, and mosques to
government buildings, storefronts, and stadiums. Of
course, material culture also includes the associated

speaking of culture | 97

furnishings, appliances, tools, implements, and personal
possessions within buildings.
We are surrounded by material culture. As Boivin (2008:
225) reminds us: “From the moment we are born, we
engage in an ongoing and increasingly intensive
interaction with environments that are to varying degrees
natural and human-made.” They are environments that we
have shaped and that in turn have shaped us, “and yet,”
notes Boivin, “in many ways, we have barely begun to study
its role in our lives.”

Non-material aspects of culture
Social scientists have long distinguished material from
non-material culture despite the fact that they are closely
intertwined. Material culture consists of tangible objects
that people create: tools, toys, buildings, furniture, images,
and even print and digital media—a seemingly endless list
of items. As we saw in Chapter 3, material culture can tell
us a lot about the activities of people as remote in time as
the Upper Paleolithic (and earlier). In fact, material culture
is almost all we have to inform us about human culture
in the deep past before the existence of written records.
While material culture provides clues about the lives of the
people who create and use it, material culture alone is silent
about many other details, for much of human culture is
non-material.
Non-material culture includes such things as: beliefs,
values, norms, customs, traditions, and rituals, to give just
a few examples. In this chapter, we will discuss these
typical categories of thought and action often associated
with the concept of culture.

Beliefs
A belief is a propositional attitude, a settled way of
thinking. Since a proposition is a statement, beliefs when
expressed (at least in English) generally take the form of
declarative sentences. As Schwitzgebel (2015) has pointed
out, the vast majority of our beliefs are actually quite
mundane. We rarely bother to express them at all, and we
certainly never question them. Here are a couple of
examples of some pretty mundane beliefs:

102 |

• All people have heads.
• The hand on the end of my arm is my hand (not someone
else’s).
Mundane beliefs are, for the most part, universally
shared by all normally functioning people. Of course, not
all beliefs are universally shared. Some beliefs are purely
personal. Mary may believe, with good reason, that eggs
give her indigestion. George may believe, without very
good evidence, that the best way to guarantee rain is to
wash his car. Personal beliefs may be well founded or not
so well founded. At any rate, mundane beliefs and purely
personal beliefs are of no particular cross-cultural interest.
Of greater interest for students of culture are the beliefs
(and systems of beliefs) that are widely shared among
members of particular communities of people. While
mundane beliefs may be universally shared across most
cultures, culturally shared beliefs tend to have boundaries.
The members of one group may consider their own, shared
cultural beliefs as self-evidently true, while members of
other groups might consider the same beliefs as
questionable, if not strange and arbitrary. Culturally
relevant beliefs govern every conceivable aspect of social
life: religious, political, economic, and domestic to mention
only a few. (This categorization of beliefs is casual at best; it
is not meant to exhaust all the possible ways the word belief
is used in everyday English.)

Values
Cultural values are closely associated with both the beliefs
and norms of a cultural community. Values can be defined
as the abstract concepts or standards that represent the
speaking of culture | 103

ideals of a group. They point to what the group most
regards as right, good, beautiful, desirable, etc. Values are
often identified in discourse by means of words or phrases,
e.g., “freedom,” “equality,” “filial piety,” “respect for elders.”
Values, though, go hand in hand with beliefs. Think of a
value, when articulated, as a short hand way of referring to
a belief. But of course, a value is hardly a value unless it is
acted upon. In other words, we generally think of a value as
a guide to conduct.
What purpose do values serve? – we might want to ask.
For one thing, shared cultural values may help promote
group cohesion. They encourage group members to behave
in ways that the group considers appropriate, proper,
honorable, praiseworthy, and the like. As is true also with
beliefs and norms though, not everyone necessarily
adheres to the widely shared values of a culture to the same
degree, and sometimes not at all. In fact, some cultural
values may even be in conflict with other values.
Cross-cultural
comparisons
of
values
using
questionnaires have been particularly popular with social
scientists for well over a half-century. Later in our
explorations, we will examine several different frameworks
that social scientists have proposed for studying
differences in values across cultures.

Norms
Norms are the expectations or rules, formal or informal,
about how one should behave in a particular social
situation. Sociologists since the time of William Graham
Sumner (1906) have generally distinguished two different
types of norms: folkways and mores. Folkways are a loose
collection of usual or customary ways in which the
104 |

members of a particular cultural community behave.
Examples include: how people greet one another, how they
dress, what they eat, how they prepare it, and how they
eat it, how they handle inter-personal conflict, etc. Mores
(pronounced “more-rays”) are stricter than folkways. They
are the standards of moral conduct and ethical behavior
that the people in a cultural community expect of one
another. They include such things as rules against killing,
rules about who can or cannot have sex with whom, and so
on.
The mores of a society are enforced in various ways. The
most important mores are upheld by means of laws, which
are explicitly stated rules. People who violate laws may have
to pay a penalty, for example, going to jail, or paying a
monetary fine. Other mores may not be strictly against the
law but are nevertheless strongly endorsed by a society.
Such mores may be upheld mainly by means of social
sanctions, which are ways of communicating disapproval
or putting pressure on people who violate a community’s
mores. For example, people who violate mores for which
there are no formal laws may find that the people of a
community make life uncomfortable for them. The
community may publically condemn the person
(“shaming”) or avoid interacting with the person
(“shunning”).
One way to look at the difference between folkways and
mores is to say that folkways reflect what a cultural
community regards as appropriate or inappropriate, polite
or rude. Mores, however, reflect what a community
considers as morally or ethically right or wrong.

speaking of culture | 105

Customs and Traditions
Customs and traditions are two more terms often
employed in discussing culture. A custom is a widely
accepted way of doing something, specific to a particular
society, place or time, and that has developed through
repetition over a long period of time. So defined, it is hard
to see how customs differ from folkways as discussed
above. I am not sure they do. Whether a practice is called
a folkway or custom might revolve around whether the
practice is being discussed by a sociologist or a social
historian.
But what is a tradition? David Gross (1992: 8) defines
tradition as “a set of practices, a constellation of beliefs,
or mode of thinking that exists in the present, but was
inherited from the past.” Gross further elaborates, writing
that a tradition “can be a set of observances, a collection of
doctrines or teachings, a particular type of behavior, a way
of thinking about the world or oneself, a way of regarding
others or interpreting reality.”
Gross (1992: 12) acknowledges that customs and
traditions have much in common and that therefore the
differences between them are easily blurred. He insists,
however, that from the perspective of society as a whole,
customs are less important than traditions. Compared with
traditions, Gross claims, customs involve “mostly
superficial modes of behavior” that “are not as heavily
invested with value.” For example, says Gross, long
standing forms of greeting, like bowing in Japan, or
shaking hands in the U.S. are “relatively insignificant social
habits,” better characterized as customs than as traditions.
Still, Gross admits, “the boundary separating custom from
tradition is not always easy to discern.”
106 |

To call any practice a tradition, however, is often taken
to imply that the practice is not just of great value but also
ancient, something that has been passed down through
many generations unchanged. Scholarly studies of
tradition, however, contradict this widely held assumption.
Although some traditions may have ancient roots, rarely,
if ever, does any practice remain fixed for all time. Times
change, and traditions disappear or are significantly
transformed.
Even more startling, traditions are often invented and
passed off as ancient, when in fact they are fully modern. As
Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) have argued, the invention
of tradition is a hallmark of that “recent historical
innovation, the ‘nation,’ with its associated phenomena:
nationalism, the nation-state, national symbols, histories
and the rest.” Although today’s nation-states are modern
inventions, they “generally claim to be the opposite …
namely rooted in the remotest antiquity,” representing
human communities that are entirely ‘natural’ (Hobsbawm
& Ranger, 1983: 13-14).

Rituals
Ritual refers primarily to categories of action. Rites and
ceremonies are other words commonly used to identify
particular forms of ritual. Like the word “culture,” the word
“ritual” has such a broad range of uses in everyday English
that it might be hard to decide what counts as ritual and
what does not. When I have asked American students to
identify rituals, they often give examples such as:
• gathering to watch fireworks on the 4th of July

speaking of culture | 107

• throwing tailgate parties outside the stadium before
football games
• “trick or treating” on Halloween
• gathering around the TV on Thanksgiving to watch
parades and football
• enjoying Thanksgiving dinner, including turkey and
other dishes typical of the occasion
I have always thought examples like these involve an
overly loose use of the word ritual. To me the above
examples are customs; I don’t think I would call them
traditions. Not that there must always be clear boundaries
between such concepts. Nevertheless, I have always
thought of rituals as involving actions performed in very
structured ways, often having some religious or spiritual
significance, or perhaps a social or civic purpose.
In studying ritual, one soon learns that there is little
agreement among scholars about how exactly to define
ritual. Some scholars take a broad approach. They might
find no problem with the examples given above. Other
scholars may be more likely to agree with me that using the
term too broadly turns almost every collective routine into
ritual. For instance, some scholars go so far as to regard the
conventional handshake as a form of ritual. This seems to
me a step too far.
It is true, when we define ritual more narrowly, as I
would like to do, many of us living in modern secular
societies may find it hard to identify examples of rituals.
Indeed, formal ritual activity seems to have become less
important in modern societies than it was in more
traditional societies. While the lives of people in traditional
societies are often filled with ritual obligations, those of us
108 |

living in modern secular societies tend to observe just a few
rites to mark major life transitions such as birth, marriage,
and death (Bell, 2009). We moderns tend to think of rituals
as special activities, separate from our daily routines.
How can we make sense of this unruly concept? In her
book, Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions, Bell suggests a
distinction between ritual and ritual-like activities.
Ritual-like activities are activities that have some
characteristics of ritual, such as formality, appeal to
tradition, disciplined invariance, rule-governance, and
performance. For instance, says Bell, there is a formality to
routines of greeting and parting that make them ritual-like
even if we do not consider them full-fledged rituals. The
same can be said of table manners. On the other hand, the
American celebration of Thanksgiving is a good example
of an activity that is ritual-like in its appeal to tradition.
Thanksgiving is often thought of as a kind of re-enactment
of the first Thanksgiving although, as Bell (2009: 145) points
out, stories about the origin of Thanksgiving may be more
myth than historical fact. But let’s move quickly on to ritual
proper.
Since ritual practices vary so widely, scholars have often
taken a genre approach in studying them, grouping them
into categories according to shared characteristics. Some
scholars have kept the number of categories very small.
For instance, cultural anthropologist Victor Turner divided
all rituals into one of two basic genres: life-crisis rituals
and affliction rituals. On the other hand, Ronald Grimes, a
professor of religious studies, proposed a system of sixteen
different categories. However, a system that may be more
convenient for our purposes is the one proposed by
religious studies scholar Catherine Bell (2009). Her list of
ritual genres offers a compromise between simplicity and
speaking of culture | 109

completeness. Bell suggests that rituals can be grouped
into six basic genres: 1) rites of passage, 2) calendrical and
commemorative rites, 3) rites of exchange and
communion, 4) rites of affliction, 5) rites of feasting,
fasting, and festivals, and 6) political rites.
Rites of passage (or life-cycle rites) are ceremonies that call
attention to major events in the social life of individuals.
These include rites associated with birth, the transition
from childhood to adulthood, marriage, and death. Rites
of passage can also mark initiation into religious
communities, for example, baptism in Christian
communities. Clubs, fraternities, and secret societies often
put new initiates through ritual ordeals before accepting
them into the new community.
In some societies, rites of passage may be short and
simple while in others they may be lengthy and complex. In
the U.S. and many other industrialized countries, rites of
passage are often less highly organized and less elaborate
except perhaps in some subcultures or small communities.
On the other hand, in agricultural villages in China, says
Bell (2009: 96), birth rituals are often still observed in all
their traditional complexity. When a young woman
marries, she is brought to live with the husband’s family.
She may be considered an outsider of little importance
until she bears a son to carry on the family name. Her
mother-in-law may engage in rituals involving
presentation of offerings to special maternal deities.
Pregnancy and childbirth are also surrounded by a
seemingly endless series of ritual observances.
Calendrical rites are another important category of ritual.
Bell (2009: 103) distinguishes two types: seasonal and
commemorative. Seasonal celebrations are associated with
cycles of planting and harvesting among agriculturalists,
110 |

while among pastoralists, the focus is on grazing and
moving the herd. Sowing seeds in many different societies
is commonly accompanied by offerings to ancestors or
deities. Harvesting often involves the giving of the first
yield to the gods or the ancestors, as well as communal
feasting accompanied by music, dance, and a relaxing of
social restraint. Commemorative celebrations usually revolve
around remembrance or re-enactment of important
historical events (even though the supposed date of an
event may not be known for sure). The events
commemorated are often events that play a role in a
particular religious tradition or celebrate aspects of
national heritage. The rite of Holy Communion in the
Catholic Church, for instance, is performed in
remembrance of the Last Supper.
Then there are rites of exchange and communion. These
involve the making of offerings to a god or gods, sometimes
with the expectation of getting something in return, like
a good harvest. Offerings may also be made to praise or
please or appease a god or deity. In some cultures, the
offering consisted of the sacrifice of an animal (e.g., the
ancient Hebrews), and some cultures have even practiced
human sacrifice (e.g., the Aztecs). Rituals of affliction, on the
other hand, are actions taken to diagnose and deal with
the unseen causes of misfortune or to alleviate physical or
mental illnesses. Many pre-modern cultures believe such
problems are caused by things like evil spirits, spirits of the
dead, magic or witchcraft. Rituals of affliction often involve
not just the afflicted but entire communities and have as
their objective the idea of purification or exorcism.
Another ritual genre is that of feasting, fasting, and
festivals. These usually place less overt emphasis on the
presence of deities than rites of exchange and communion.
speaking of culture | 111

Instead what seems to be important is the public display of
cultural and religious commitment and sentiment. A good
example of ritual fasting is the worldwide Muslim
communal fasting during the month of Ramadan, the
ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. During
Ramadan, Muslims do not eat or drink anything from the
time the sun rises until it sets. (Exceptions are made for
the elderly, the sick, and for pregnant women, as well as for
people traveling.) After Ramadan, Muslims celebrate Eid al
Fitr, literally the “feast of breaking the fast.” Well known
festivals include Carnival in places like New Orleans and
Brazil and water festivals that take place in many countries
in East and Southeast Asia (e.g., China, Cambodia, Laos,
Myanmar and Thailand).
Finally, observes Bell (2009: 220), political rites make up
a diverse and loose genre. These include ceremonial
practices that display and promote the power of political
institutions. The coronation of the Queen of England
would be an example. In addition, national salutes might
also count as political rites, e.g., the American pledge of
allegiance, or to give a more sinister example from the
WWII era, the “Heil Hitler” salute. Revolutionary or antiestablishment gestures could also be counted as political
rites, for instance, cross-burning by the KKK.

Final reflection
The terms covered in this chapter are among the most
common terms used in enumerating what we have called
non-material aspects of culture. But to reiterate a point
made at the beginning of the chapter, it is not always
possible to separate material and non-material culture. For
instance, while we have defined a custom as a widely
112 |

accepted way of doing something, that doing may very well
include a material object. For instance, it might be
customary to send a friend or relative a birthday
greeting—an action, but that greeting may take material
form—a birthday card. Or let’s take ritual as an example.
Although a ritual is an action, ritual actions often employ
ritual objects: incense, candles, chalices, prayer beads,
bells, gongs, drums, and so on.
Not only can it be difficult to separate material and nonmaterial culture, it is also not always easy to distinguish
between some categories of non-material culture discussed
in this chapter. For instance, we have already discussed
the difficulty of distinguishing between a custom and a
tradition. Is there a difference between a custom and a
norm? If there is, it is surely subtle and unimportant for our
purposes. On the other hand, there clearly is a difference
between a law (at least in the modern sense of the term)
and a more.
At this point, I would invite you, dear reader, to go
through the list of terms introduced in the chapter and
provide original examples of beliefs, values, norms,
customs, traditions, and rituals that you consider to be
elements of a cultural community that you are familiar
with.

Application
FOR FURTHER THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION

1. Identify at least three beliefs that are important in a cultural
community that you identify with. Try to discover beliefs that
govern different aspects of life, e.g., political, economic, social, or
some other. Can you name an associated value for each belief ?
2. See if you can discover a cultural belief that is at odds with one of
your own deeply held personal beliefs.
3. We often belong to more than one cultural community. Sometimes
the beliefs of one community are in conflict with the beliefs of
another community. Can you identify any such situation in your
own experience?
FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

1. Culture is not something fixed. Cultures can change over time. Can
you discover a custom that has changed in the lifetime of someone
that you know (e.g., a parent or grandparent)?
2. Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) have argued that what we regard
as ancient traditions are sometimes more recent than we think.
Can you discover any tradition that is actually more recent than
people commonly believe?

Chapter 6: Beliefs, Values,
and Cultural Universals

Suggested Focus
This chapter delves into two theories of cultural values in more detail. The
following tasks invite you not only to restate ideas from the chapter but also
to apply the theories to communities of your own choosing.

1. What are the five questions that every society must answer,
according to Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck? Identify the three
potential responses to each question.
2. List and define Hofstede’s six dimensions of culture. Choose two
national cultures that interest you. Compare and contrast them
using Hofstede’s model.
3. Identify four problems that critics have identified with Hofstede’s
theory.
4. Do you think it is possible to identify national values, or do you
think values differ significantly from person to person and place to
place? Explain.

Value Orientations Theory
The Kluckhohn-Strodtbeck Value Orientations theory
represents one of the earliest efforts to develop a crosscultural theory of values. According to Kluckhohn and
Strodtbeck (1961), every culture faces the same basic
survival needs and must answer the same universal
questions. It is out of this need that cultural values arise.
The basic questions faced by people everywhere fall into
five categories and reflect concerns about: 1) human
nature, 2) the relationship between human beings and the
natural world, 3) time, 4) human activity, and 5) social
relations. Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck hypothesized three
possible responses or orientations to each of the concerns.

What is the inherent nature of human beings?
This is a question, say Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck, that all
societies ask, and there are generally three different
responses. The people in some societies are inclined to
believe that people are inherently evil and that the society
must exercise strong measures to keep the evil impulses
of people in check. On the other hand, other societies are
more likely to see human beings as born basically good
118 |

and possessing an inherent tendency towards goodness.
Between these two poles are societies that see human
beings as possessing the potential to be either good or evil
depending upon the influences that surround them.
Societies also differ on whether human nature is
immutable (unchangeable) or mutable (changeable).

What is the relationship between human beings and the
natural world?
Some societies believe nature is a powerful force in the face
of which human beings are essentially helpless. We could
describe this as “nature over humans.” Other societies are
more likely to believe that through intelligence and the
application of knowledge, humans can control nature. In
other words, they embrace a “humans over nature”
position. Between these two extremes are the societies who
believe humans are wise to strive to live in “harmony with
nature.”

What is the best way to think about time?
Some societies are rooted in the past, believing that people
should learn from history and strive to preserve the
traditions of the past. Other societies place more value on
the here and now, believing people should live fully in the
present. Then there are societies that place the greatest
value on the future, believing people should always delay
immediate satisfactions while they plan and work hard to
make a better future.

speaking of culture | 119

What is the proper mode of human activity?
In some societies, “being” is the most valued orientation.
Striving for great things is not necessary or important. In
other societies, “becoming” is what is most valued. Life is
regarded as a process of continual unfolding. Our purpose
on earth, the people might say, is to become fully human.
Finally, there are societies that are primarily oriented to
“doing.” In such societies, people are likely to think of the
inactive life as a wasted life. People are more likely to
express the view that we are here to work hard and that
human worth is measured by the sum of accomplishments.

What is the ideal relationship between the individual and
society?
Expressed another way, we can say the concern is about
how a society is best organized. People in some societies
think it most natural that a society be organized
hierarchically. They hold to the view that some people are
born to lead and others to follow. Leaders, they feel, should
make all the important decisions. Other societies are best
described as valuing collateral relationships. In such
societies, everyone has an important role to play in society;
therefore, important decisions should be made by
consensus. In still other societies, the individual is the
primary unit of society. In societies that place great value
on individualism, people are likely to believe that each
person should have control over his/her own destiny. When
groups convene to make decisions, they should follow the
principle of “one person, one vote.”
In an early application of the theory, Kluckhohn and
Strodtbeck interviewed members of five cultural groups in
120 |

the American Southwest: 1) Navajo people traveling around
the Southwest seeking work, 2) white homesteaders in
Texas, 3) Mexican-Americans, 4) Mormon villagers, and 5)
Zuni pueblo dwellers. Researchers have found the
framework useful in making sense of diverse cultures
around the world.
As Hill (2002) has observed, Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck did
not consider the theory to be complete. In fact, they
originally proposed a sixth value orientation—Space: here,
there, or far away, which they could not quite figure out
how to investigate at the time. And Hill has proposed a
number of additional questions that one might expect
cultural groups to grapple with:
• Space – Should space belong to individuals, to groups
(especially the family) or to everybody?
• Work – What should be the basic motivation for work?
To make a contribution to society, to have a sense of
personal achievement, or to attain financial security?
• Gender – How should society distribute roles, power and
responsibility between the sexes? Should decisionmaking be done primarily by men, by women, or by
both?
• The Relationship between State and Individual – Should
rights and responsibilities be granted to the nation or
the individual?
Today, the Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck framework is just
one among many attempts to study universal human
values. Others include those of Hofstede (1997), Rokeach
(1979), and Schwartz (2006).

Hofstede’s dimensions of culture theory
Geert Hofstede articulated a Dimensions of Culture theory
in the 1980s, and has updated and revised it over the years.
Hofstede’s theory currently gets a lot of attention in basic
texts that include discussion of cultural values. Based on
survey data collected from IBM employees, Hofstede has
argued that his theory is particularly useful for highlighting
similarities and differences between national cultures.
Hofstede initially identified four dimensions.

Power Distance
Power distance is a measure of the degree to which less
powerful members of society expect and accept an unequal
distribution of power. There is a certain degree of
inequality in all societies, notes Hofstede; however, there
is relatively more equality in some societies than in others.
Countries vary along a continuum from countries where
power distance is very low to countries where power
distance is very high. Measured on a scale of 1-100 for
instance, Denmark scores very low and Mexico scores quite
high. The U.S. falls somewhere in between.
Countries with lower PDI values tend to be more
egalitarian. For instance, there is more equality between
parents and children with parents more likely to accept it if
children argue with them, or “talk back” to use a common
expression. In the work place, bosses are more likely to ask
employees for input, and in fact, subordinates expect to
be consulted. On the other hand, in countries with high
power distance, parents expect children to obey without
questioning. People of higher status may expect
conspicuous displays of respect from subordinates. In the

122 |

workplace, superiors and subordinates are not likely to see
each other as equals, and it is assumed that bosses will
make decisions without consulting employees. In general,
status is more important in high power distance countries.

Individualism vs. collectivism
Individualism vs. collectivism anchor opposite ends of a
continuum that describes how people define themselves
and their relationships with others. Countries that score
higher on individualism measure are considered by
definition less collectivistic than countries that score lower.
In more highly individualistic societies, the interests of
individuals receive more emphasis than those of the group
(e.g., the family, the company, etc.). Individualistic
124 |

societies put more value on self-striving and personal
accomplishment, while more collectivistic societies put
more emphasis on the importance of relationships and
loyalty. People are defined more by what they do in
individualistic societies while in collectivistic societies,
they are defined more by their membership in particular
groups. Communication is more direct in individualistic
societies but more indirect in collectivistic societies. The
U.S. ranks very high in individualism, and South Korea
ranks quite low. Japan falls close to the middle.

Masculinity vs. femininity
Masculinity vs. femininity refers to a dimension that
describes the extent to which strong distinctions exist
between men’s and women’s roles in society. Societies that
score higher on the masculinity scale tend to value
assertiveness, competition, and material success.
Countries that score lower in masculinity tend to embrace
values more widely thought of as feminine values, e.g.,
modesty, quality of life, interpersonal relationships, and
greater concern for the disadvantaged of society. Societies
high in masculinity are also more likely to have strong
opinions about what constitutes men’s work vs. women’s
work while societies low in masculinity permit much
greater overlapping in the social roles of men and women.

Uncertainty avoidance
Uncertainty avoidance measures the extent to which people
value predictability and view uncertainty or the unknown
as threatening. People in societies that measure high in
uncertainty avoidance prefer to know exactly what to
expect in any given situation. They want firm rules and
strict codes of behavior. They dislike ambiguity. People

126 |

from countries that score low on uncertainty avoidance
generally have a higher tolerance for ambiguity. They are
happy to have few rules and prefer less structured rather
than more tightly structured contexts. In educational
settings, people from countries high in uncertainty
avoidance expect their teachers to be experts with all of
the answers. People from countries low in uncertainty
avoidance don’t mind it when a teacher says, “I don’t
know.”

Long-term vs. short-term orientation
Long-term vs. short-term orientation is a 5th dimension
developed some years after the initial four. It emerged as a
result of an effort by a research group (The Chinese Culture
Connection, 1987) to develop a universal values framework
with a non-Western bias. According to Hofstede (1997: 161),
the resulting Chinese Values Survey overlapped with three
of Hofstede’s dimensions: power distance, individualism,
and masculinity although not with the uncertainty
avoidance dimension. In addition, the group found a
unique factor not reflected in Hofstede’s work, which they
called Confucian dynamism. Hofstede has since
incorporated Confucian dynamism into his own theory as
long-term vs. short-term orientation. Long-term
orientation is associated with thrift, savings, persistence
toward results, and the willingness to subordinate oneself
for a purpose. Short-term orientation is associated with
less saving, a preference for quick results, and unrestrained
spending in response to social pressure (often referred to
in English as “keeping up with the Joneses”).

Indulgence vs. self-restraint
Indulgence vs. self-restraint represents another new
dimension. People living in countries that score high on
indulgence are more likely to value the free gratification of
human desires. Enjoying life and having fun are important
to them. On the other hand, people in countries high on
restraint are more likely to believe that gratification should
be curbed and that it should be regulated by strict social
norms (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010: 281).

Critique of Hofstede’s theory
Among the various attempts by social scientists to study
human values from a cultural perspective, Hofstede’s is
certainly popular. In fact, it would be a rare culture text
that did not pay special attention to Hofstede’s theory. The
current text is a case in point. However, Hofstede’s theory

speaking of culture | 129

has also been seriously questioned, and we will summarize
some of the most common criticisms below.
First, Hofstede’s methodology has been criticized. To
begin with, the way in which the questionnaire was
developed has been described as haphazard (Orr & Hauser,
2008). Indeed, the questionnaire was not even originally
developed to explore cultural values but instead to assess
job satisfaction within IBM. It is hard to believe that
questions framed to explore workplace attitudes are
relevant to broader cultural attitudes outside of the work
place.
Critics also point out that Hofstede’s conclusions are
based on insufficient samples McSweeney, 2002). Although
117,000 questionnaires were administered, only the results
from 40 countries were used. Furthermore, only 6 countries
had more than 1000 respondents, and in 15 countries, there
were fewer than 200 respondents. Surely it is not
appropriate for 200 people to speak on behalf of a country
of millions.
Critics have also been skeptical about the assumption
that IBM employees are representative of national cultures
as a whole. And even within IBM, the surveys were
administered only to certain categories of workers, i.e.,
“marketing-plus-sales,” leaving out many other employee
categories, including blue-collar workers, full-time
students, retired employees, etc. (McSweeney, 2002).
Hofstede has suggested that restricting the sample in this
way effectively controls for the effects of occupational
category and class, insuring that the relevant variable of
comparison is nationality. However, it seems hard to
escape the conclusion that since the study consisted solely
of IBM employees, the results may have more to say about
IBM corporate culture than about anything broader.
130 |

Moreover, we should not forget that when Hofstede’s
research was first conducted, IBM employed mostly men,
so women’s perspectives are also largely missing (Orr &
Hauser, 2008).
Hofstede’s theory has also been faulted for promoting
a largely static view of culture (Hamden-Turner &
Trompenaars, 1997). As Orr and Hauser (2008) have
suggested, the world has changed in dramatic ways since
Hofstede’s research began. The world map has changed,
cultures themselves may have changed, and the original
data is likely to be out of date. In fact, it is somewhat of
a puzzle why Hofstede’s theory continues to enjoy the
popularity that it does. Indeed, over the years, attempts by
many researchers to replicate Hofstede’s findings have not
been very successful (Orr & Hauser, 2008).

Final reflection
In this chapter, we have surveyed two approaches to the
study of cultural values: that of Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck,
that of Hofstede. The study of values will no doubt remain
a vibrant subject for cross-cultural researchers.
However, implicit in Hofstede’s work, in particular, is
the idea that there exists such a thing as a national culture.
In discussing cultural values, we have temporarily gone
along with this suggestion. However, in closing, let us raise
the question of whether the idea of national culture actually
makes any sense. McSweeney (2002: 110), echoing the
sentiments of many other scholars insists that, “the
prefixing of the name of a country to something to imply
national uniformity is grossly over-used.” In his view,
Hofstede’s dimensions are little more than statistical
myths.

In the chapters to come, we will suggest that culture is a
term better applied to small collectivities and explain why
the idea that there is any such thing as national culture may
be a mere illusion.

Application
FOR FURTHER THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION

1. Choose a community that you know well and decide where you
think most members of the community would place themselves
within Table 6.1—the Kluckhohn-Strodtbeck Value Orientations
framework. Explain your reasoning. Are your views the same or
different from those of your primary community?
2. Is your primary cultural community a “high-indulgence” or a
“high-restraint” community? How does this cultural orientation
align with your own personal orientation? Are you a
“high-indulgence” or a “high-restraint” person?

Membership and Identity

speaking of culture | 135

Suggested Focus
This chapter deals with a complex topic that has generated much scholarly
debate. The following questions and tasks will get you started on the road
to understanding the issues.

1. Give a one-sentence definition of ethnicity. List some features often
associated with ethnicity. Identify some other terms that also
might suggest ethnicity?
2. Why do many scholars now think it is incorrect to define ethnicity
in terms of shared culture? How do they now prefer to define it?
3. If race is not biological category, and it is not a cultural category,
what is it? How does Appiah prove that racial identification is not
necessarily a cultural affair?
4. In what way do social classes seem to exhibit cultural differences?
5. What is the difference between a country, a nation, and a
nation-state? How is a nation like an ethnic group, and how is it
different?
6. Identify two forms of nationalism. How are they similar and how
are they different? What does the work of Theiss-Morse teach us
about American national identity?

Preliminary remarks
In this chapter, we will examine the theme of culture as
group membership. One of the most common ways that
we use the term culture in everyday English is to refer to
people who share the same nationality. We think of people
from Korea, for instance, as exemplifying “Korean culture,”
or people from Saudi Arabia as exemplifying “Saudi
culture.”

136 |

If we are interested in arriving at a coherent
understanding of the concept of culture, I believe this
usage leads us astray. The idea that culture is a product of
human activity and that it includes everything that people
make and everything they think and do (together) … that
idea of culture seems fairly clear and useful. However, to
turn around and call a whole nationality a culture, as we are
often tempted to do, is an invitation to confusion.
Perhaps it made sense for anthropologists in the 19th
and early 20th centuries who focused on traditional
societies to think of the small geographically isolated
groups they studied as cultures. Such groups were small
enough that for the most part they did share all aspects of
culture: language, beliefs, kinship patterns, technologies,
etc.
But the large collectives of the modern world that we
call nation-states are not culturally homogenous. In other
words, we will expect to find different cultures in different
places, or even different cultures intermingling with one
another in the same places. We say that the society in
question is multicultural. What this means for the idea of
culture as group membership is that we will need a strategy
for identifying the various groups that are presumably the
repositories of the many cultures of a multicultural society.
One way that sociologists have tried to conceptualize the
parts that together make up the whole of a society is by
means of the distinction between culture and subculture.
On the other hand, historians and political scientists have
been more interested in a macroscopic view, inquiring into
the origins of nationality and the relationships between
such things as nationality and ethnicity.

speaking of culture | 137

Cultures and subcultures
According to many sociologists, the dominant culture of a
society is the one exemplified by the most powerful group
in the society. Taking the United States as an example,
Andersen, Taylor and Logio (2015: 36-37) suggest that while
it is hard to isolate a dominant culture, there seems to be
a “widely acknowledged ‘American’ culture,” epitomized by
“middle class values, habits, and economic resources,
strongly influenced by . . . television, the fashion industry,
and Anglo-European traditions,” and readily thought of as
“including diverse elements such as fast food, Christmas
shopping, and professional sports.” Philosopher and
cultural theorist Kwame Appiah (1994: 116) is more pointed,
emphasizing America’s historically Christian beginnings,
its Englishness in terms both of language and traditions,
and the mark left on it by the dominant classes, including
government, business, and cultural elites.
In contrast to the dominant culture of a society, say
sociologists, are the various subcultures, conceived as
groups that are part of the dominant culture but that differ
from it in important ways. Many sociology textbooks are
quick to propose race and ethnicity as important bases for
the formation of subcultures. Other commonly mentioned
bases include geographic region, occupation, social or
economic class, and religion (Dowd & Dowd, 2003: 25).
Although this way of thinking about the connections
between culture and groups has now fallen somewhat out
of favor among cultural theorists, it is still common in basic
sociology texts. Therefore, we will outline it here along with
the caveat that there is an alternative way of looking at
group membership, one grounded in the concept of
identity rather than of culture.
138 |

Ethnicity
The term ethnicity has to do with the study of ethnic groups
and ethnic relations. But what is an ethnic group? Let’s
start by making clear what it is not. It is not a biological
category. Therefore, it is not possible to establish a person’s
ethnicity by genetic testing. Instead, an ethnic group is
one whose members share a common ancestry, or at least
believe that they do, and that also share one or more other
features, possibly including language, collective memory,
culture, ritual, dress, and religion (Meer, 2014; Zenner,
1996). According to Meer (p. 37), the shared features may be
real or imagined. Although sociologists once treated ethnic
groups as if they were categories that could be objectively
established, at least in principle, many scholars today see
ethnicity primarily as a form of self-identification (Banton,
2015; Meer, 2014). In other words, an individual’s ethnicity
is not something that can be tested for by checking off a list
of defining features that serve to establish that individual’s
ethnicity.
If you ask an American about his/her ethnicity, you
might get a variety of different answers. Some people will
emphasize their American-ness, by which they mean they
do not think of themselves as belonging to any particular
ethnic group. Others may point to national origins,
emphasizing the fact that they are children of immigrants
(or even perhaps themselves immigrants). If they identify
strongly with their immigrant heritage, they might use a
term, such as Italian American, Cuban American, or
Mexican American. Americans of African ancestry are
likely to identify (or be automatically identified by others)
as African American. Americans of various Asian
backgrounds, may specify that they are Chinese American,
speaking of culture | 139

Japanese American, Korean American, etc. (although if
they think they are speaking to someone that wouldn’t
know the difference, they might just say, Asian American.

Many U.S. cities abound in ethnic neighborhoods. (Dragon Gate
to Chinatown in San Francisco)

A common phenomenon in the United States is the
presence of neighborhoods, popularly characterized as
ethnic, especially in large cosmopolitan cities. Such
neighborhoods result from the fact that the U.S. has
historically been a country open to immigration, and
immigrants are often likely to settle where their fellow
countrymen have previously settled. Many American cities,
for instance, have their Little Italy(s), China Towns, Korea
Towns, and so on. The residents of these ethnic enclaves
might be more or less integrated into the larger society
depending upon such factors as how long they have lived in
the U.S., or how well they speak English.
A Native American (i.e., an American Indian) might
interpret an inquiry about ethnicity as a question about
tribal identity. He or she might say—Ute, Shoshoni,
140 |

Navaho, Lakota, etc. On the other hand, since not all of
these tribal names are names that the tribes claim as their
own, they may refer to themselves in their native language.
For instance, the Navajo call themselves Diné. Tribal
affiliations would also be salient in Africa, the Middle East
and Central Asia. For instance, two major tribes in
Afghanistan are the Tajiks and Pashtuns.
In China, the term minzu (民族) is used to refer to what,
in English, we would call ethnic groups. Officially, the
Chinese government recognizes 56 minzu. Just how the
government decided on 56 as the definitive number of
minzu in China, however, is an interesting story.
It
may
be

Hui people, third largest ethnic group in China

tempting to think that people who share an ethnic identity
also share a common culture. Indeed, that is what is
implied in calling an ethnic group a subculture. Sometimes
it is the case that people who share an ethnic identity are
also culturally similar. But it is shared identity and not
speaking of culture | 141

shared culture that makes a group ethnic. In fact, scholars
specializing in ethnic studies have discovered many
examples of different groups claiming a common ethnic
identity but not sharing a common language, nor even
common beliefs, values, customs or traditions. This shows
that the connections between culture, group membership,
and identity are loose at best.
It is also important to note that ethnic identification is
not an irreversible decision. Sometimes people change
ethnicity as easily as they might change clothes by simply
deciding to no longer identify as, for example, Han 汉族
(the largest minzu in China) but to identify instead as Hui
回族 (one of the largest “national minorities” in China).

Racial identity
Since the demise of the idea that race is grounded in
biology—race, like ethnicity, has come to be regarded
primarily as a matter of social identity. Also like ethnicity, it
is often presumed, incorrectly, that individuals who share
a racial identity must share a common culture. As Appiah
(1994: 117) has noted, “it is perfectly possible for a black and
a white American to grow up together in a shared adoptive
family—with the same knowledge and values—and still
grow into separate racial identities, in part because their
experience outside the family, in public space, is bound to
be racially differentiated.” In other words, it is a mistake,
not only to assume that race and ethnicity represent
biological categories; it is also a mistake to assume them to
be cultural categories.
As we mentioned in the previous section, ethnic
identification is typically (although not always) self-

142 |

determined. On the other hand, racial identities are more
likely to be imposed on an individual by others. For
example, “white” Americans are likely to presume certain
individuals to be “black” or African American based on
perceived physical characteristics, including skin color,
hair texture and various facial features alleged to be
characteristically African. Long before “African American”
children have ever had time to reflect on matters of
identity, that identity has been decided for them. As with
any identity, individuals have it within their power to resist
ethnic or racial identification. Ironically, the best, and
perhaps only way to effectively resist an ascribed identity is
to proudly embrace it.

Barack Obama and family in the Whitehouse Green Room

No doubt the most well-known American to reflect
publicly on the perplexities of racial identification in
America is Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United
States and the first black president. In his memoir, Dreams
from My Father, Obama (1995), writes eloquently of the
speaking of culture | 143

confusion he experienced growing up the son of a white
woman born in Kansas and a black man from Kenya. How
did Barack Obama come to embrace a black, or AfricanAmerican identity?
Born in Hawaii, a cauldron of ethnic diversity, peopled
by groups from all across Asia and the Pacific Islands,
Obama tells a story of race and identity that is nuanced
and reflective. Barack’s father was somewhat of a mystery
to him since his mother and father divorced and his father
returned to Kenya shortly before Barack turned 3 years old.
Throughout his childhood, Obama recounts, his white
family nurtured in him a sense of respect and pride in his
African heritage, anticipating that his appearance would
eventually require him to face questions of racial identity.
These questions surfaced gradually during adolescence,
when he began to experience a tug of war between his
white and his black identities.
Inspired by a nationally ranked University of Hawaii
basketball team with an all-black starting lineup, Barack
joined his high school basketball team. There, he says, he
made his closest white friends, and he met Ray (not his real
name), a biracial young man who introduced Barack to a
number of African Americans from the Mainland. Barack’s
experiences in multiracial Hawaii caused him to reflect
deeply on the subtle, and sometimes not so subtle,
indignities frequently faced by blacks. Increasingly
confronted by the perspectives of his black friends and his
own experiences with discrimination, Obama writes:

144 |

I learned to slip back and forth between my black and white
worlds, understanding that each possessed its own language
and customs and structures of meaning, convinced that with
a little translation on my part the two worlds would cohere.
Still, the feeling that something wasn’t quite right stayed with
me (p. 82).

Amid growing confusion, Obama writes that he turned
for counsel to black writers: Baldwin, Ellison, Hughes,
Wright, DuBois, and Malcolm X. After high school, Barack’s
quest continued throughout two years of study at
Occidental University in LA before he transferred to
Colombia University in New York. Gradually, he
constructed a provisional black identity, while never really
disavowing his white one.
But it seems to have been in Chicago that Barack Obama
finally put the finishing touches on the African American
identity that he would eventually embrace when he ran for
president in 2008. After years of working as a community
organizer in the black neighborhoods of Chicago, he had
become well known in the black community. He joined an
African American church. And he married Michelle
Robinson, herself African American and a lifelong
Chicagoan.
President Obama’s story illustrates some of the
dynamics involved in racial identification. Obama faced
questions of racial identity initially because his appearance
prompted people to label him as black. In the end, rather
than resist that label, Obama embraced it.

speaking of culture | 145

Social class and culture
Social class refers to the hierarchical ranking of people in
society based on presumably identifiable factors. American
sociologists, in trying to define these relevant factors more
precisely have tended to use the term socioeconomic status
(SES) which is measured by combining indices of family
wealth and/or income, educational attainment, and
occupational prestige (Oakes and Rossi, 2003). While
Americans are sometimes reluctant to acknowledge the
existence of social class as a determinant of social life in
the U.S., scholars have long argued that social class is a
culturally marked category. Clearly social class is reflected
in the material lives of people. For instance, lower class and
upper class people typically live in different neighborhoods,
belong to different social clubs, and attend different
educational institutions (Domhoff, 1998).
Sociologists argue that different social classes seem to
embrace a different system of values and that this is
reflected in childrearing. For instance, Kohn (1977) showed
that middle-class parents tended to value self-direction
while working class parents valued conformity to external
authority. Middle class parents aimed to instill in children
qualities of intellectual curiosity, dependability,
consideration for others, and self-control, whereas
working class parents tended to emphasize obedience,
neatness, and good manners.
More recent research (e.g., Lareau, 2011) confirms Kohn’s
findings, further emphasizing the advantages that middleclass parenting tends to confer on middle-class children.
For example, in observational studies of families, Lareau
found “more talking in middle-class homes than in
working class and poor homes, leading to the
146 |

development,” among middle class children, of “greater
verbal agility, larger vocabularies, more comfort with
authority figures, and more familiarity with abstract
concepts” (p. 5).
According to Kraus, Piff and Keltner (2011), social class
is also signaled behaviorally. For instance, in videotaped
interactions between people (in the U.S.) from different
social classes, lower-class individuals tended to show
greater social engagement as evidenced by non-verbal
signs such as eye contact, head nods, and laughs compared
to higher-class individuals who were less engaged (as
evidenced by less responsive head nodding and less eye
contact) and who were more likely to disengage by means
of actions such as checking their cell phones or doodling
(Kraus & Keltner, 2009).
Lower-class and upper class individuals also exhibit
different belief systems, with lower-class people more likely
to attribute social circumstances such as income inequality
to contextual forces (e.g., educational opportunity). On the
other hand, upper-class people are more likely to explain
inequality in dispositional terms (e.g., as a result of
differences in talent) Kluegel & Smith, 1986.
In short, different social classes seem to be distinguished
from one another by many of the characteristics that we
have previously identified as elements of culture, e.g.,
patterns of beliefs, values, collective habits, social behavior,
material possessions, etc.

Nationality
In this section, we will discuss group membership and
identity as historians and political scientists are more likely
to view them. Although their interests overlap somewhat
speaking of culture | 147

with those of sociologists, the main focus of historians and
political scientists is somewhat different. Rather than
taking the “microscopic” view that seeks to divide a larger
culture into constituent subcultures, political scientists
tend to take a more “macroscopic” view. Political scientists,
in other words, are more interested in exploring how the
various subgroups of society relate to the larger political
units of the world. Rather than dwelling on subcultural
identities, they are more likely to inquire into national
identities and the implications this may have for
international relations. Let’s shift our focus then from
ethnicity to nationality.
Our everyday understanding of nationality is that it
refers to the particular country whose passport we carry.
But this is a loose way of speaking. According to
International Law, nationality refers to membership in a
nation or sovereign state (“Nationality” 2013). Before
elaborating further, it will be useful to clarify some terms
that are often wrongly taken to be synonymous: country,
nation, and state. These are terms that have more precise
meanings in the disciplines of history, political science, and
international relations than they do in everyday
discourse. The non-expert uses terms like country and
nation with little reflection, but feels perhaps a bit uncertain
about the term state. Let’s define these terms as the political
scientist uses them.
First, what is a country? A country is simply a geographic
area with relatively well-defined borders. Sometimes these
borders are natural, e.g., a river or mountain range. But
often they are best thought of more abstractly as lines on a
map.
A nation is something entirely different. A nation is not
a geographical entity. Instead, it is a group of people with
148 |

a shared identity. Drawing on the opinions of various
scholars, Barrington (1997: 713) has suggested that many
definitions seem to converge on the idea that nations are
united by shared cultural features, which often include
myths, religious beliefs, language, political ideologies, etc.).
Unfortunately, this definition of nation has much in
common with the definition of an ethnic group. What is
the difference? Some scholars believe the difference is only
a matter of scale, e.g., that an ethnic group is simply a
smaller unit than a nation but not otherwise different in
kind. Others insist that because nations imply a
relationship to a state, in a way that that of an ethnic group
usually does not, it is important to make a clear distinction
between ethnic groups and nations (Eriksen, 2002: 97). In
other words, as Barrington further emphasizes, in addition
to shared cultural features, nations are united in a belief in
the right to territorial control over a national homeland.

speaking of culture | 149

The stateless Kurds occupy the border regions of five countries

What then is a state? First, let’s note that by the term
state, as we are using it here, we do not mean the
subdivisions of a country, as in “Utah is one of the 50 states
of the United States.” Instead, we mean the main political
unit that provides the means by which authority is
exercised over a territory and its people. In other words, the
state, as we are defining it here, refers to the instruments
of government, including things like a military to counter
external threats, a police force to maintain internal order,
and various administrative and legal institutions.
Finally, one sometimes encounters the term nation-state.
This refers to an ideal wherein a country, nation, and state
align perfectly. However, as Walby (2003: 531) has pointed
out, perfect examples of the nation-state are rarely found
in the real world where “there are far more nations than

150 |

states.” In fact, nations sometimes spill over the territorial
boundaries of multiple states. For example, the Kurds, who
can be found in parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and
Armenia, can be seen as a nation without a state. Because
they involve territorial claims, efforts on the part of some
Kurds to establish an autonomous state are resisted by the
governments of Turkey and others, sometimes leading to
violent conflict.
On the
other

boundaries exist two or more nations. This is the case in
Israel, which is home to both Israelis and Palestinians. The
latter, however, have for decades pressed for an
independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, the socalled “two state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
As the above discussion suggests, one reason that issues
of national identity are complicated is because the
relationships between nationhood, ethnicity, country,
territory and state are extraordinarily complex.
Now let’s return to our original definition of a nation and
inquire into the origins of nations. Recall that a nation is
a group of people who see themselves as united by various
shared cultural features, including myths, religious beliefs,
language, political ideologies, etc. Some scholars see
nations as having deep roots extending back to ancient
times. Smith (1986), for instance, claims that most nations
are rooted in ethnic communities and that there is a sense
in which nations have existed in various forms throughout
recorded history.
On the other hand, Gellner (1983) and Anderson (1991)
argue that nations merely imagine themselves as old, when
in fact they are really recent historical developments,
having only emerged in 19th century Europe with the rise
of sophisticated high cultures and literate populations.
Gellner and Anderson are counted among a group of
scholars often referred to as modernists who argue that
while there may have been elites in pre-modern societies
with visions of nationhood, national consciousness is a
mass phenomenon. According to this view, nations, as we
understand them today, only came into being when
societies developed ways of conveying a feeling of national
unity to the masses. At first this occurred by means such
152 |

as print and the spread of universal schooling and later by
means of radio, film and television. What Gellner suggests,
in fact, is that nations are a product of nationalism, which
is not merely “the awakening of nations to selfconsciousness,” as nationalists often proclaim, but instead
“invents nations where they do not exist” (cited in Erikson,
2002: 96).

Two different historical processes of nationalism

It is perhaps also useful to point out that not all nations
came to be nations in the same way, nor are all nations
constituted in exactly the same way. Looking at nations in
historical perspective, for instance, a distinction is often
made between ethnic nations and civic nations. The difference
turns on the question of whether the members of a
population developed a feeling of national identity before or
after the emergence of a modern state. As an illustration,
historians often point to Britain and France as the first
European nation-states to emerge through a process often
described as civic nationalism. In other words, in Britain and
France, the rational, civic, and political units of modernity
came first, and the development of a national
consciousness came later. On the other hand, Germany and
speaking of culture | 153

Russia followed a path of ethnic nationalism in which the
emergence of a national consciousness came first, followed
by the development of a fully modern state (Nikolas, 1999).
Where does the United States fit into this scheme?
Opinions vary. As Erikson (2002: 138) has pointed out, the
U.S. differs in important ways from Europe. For one thing,
it has no myths pointing to some supposed ancient origins.
In fact, it was founded barely before the beginning of the
modern era. This is not to say, however, that the U.S. lacks
a national myth; only that it is not a myth lost in the mists
of memory.
The American myth is instead a historical narrative
stretching back only about 400 years when English settlers
began arriving on the continent. The most important
chapter perhaps (from the perspective of American
national identity) revolves around the difficult and
contentious negotiation of a set of founding ideals and
principles, articulated in two rather brief documents: The
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Thereafter,
the myth continues with an account of the rapid population
of the continent by successive waves of immigration from
four other continents, Europe, Africa, Asia, and South
America. However, in our telling of the national myth, we
often omit the shameful history of injustice dealt to the
indigenous First Nations (as they are called in Canada) or
make of these details only footnotes. On the other hand,
we usually do confront the history of slavery that nearly
tore the nation apart in a civil war. We usually also recount
the story of the more than 100-year struggle of African
Americans to secure the full rights of citizenship, with its
major 20th century victories, as these reinforce a narrative
of American striving to live up to its ideals.
Today the United States is often described as multiethnic
154 |

in the sense that many of its people can trace their ancestry
to one or more geographic regions around the world.
Indeed, while most Americans speak English, at least 350
different languages are spoken in U.S. homes, including
languages from every (inhabited) continent, as well as 150
Native American languages (U. S. Bureau, 2015).
But is the U.S. an ethnic nation or a civic nation? Or to
put it in historical terms, is the U.S. a product of ethnic
nationalism or civic nationalism? Social scientists have
often regarded the U.S. as a civic nation but not in the
same way as Britain or France. American national identity
is presumably based on shared cultural features rather than
on shared ethnic heritage. However, American identity is
complicated, and current public discourse suggests a sharp
divide among American people.
One sees among many American conservatives, for
instance, a tendency to stress the nation’s Colonial Era
origins (1629-1763) with its Protestant (Christian) roots and
its Revolutionary Era (1764-1800), featuring the Founding
Fathers, who were mostly, white (male) and English.
Theiss-Morse (2009: 15-16) sees this as at the root of an
ethnocultural view of American identity. While many
Americans may see this as only part of the story, there are
some who see it as the most important part. Some
Americans have embraced this particular narrative at
various points throughout American history to promote
nativist rhetoric and restrictive immigration policies.
White supremacists often seize upon it in their efforts to
marginalize, not only immigrants, but anyone not
perceived to be ethnically “white,” Christian, and of
European ancestry.
The liberal left, on the other hand, is more inclined to
emphasize a view, which Theiss-Morse has called
speaking of culture | 155

“American identity as a set of principles” (p. 18-20). Liberals
tend to acknowledge the revolutionary achievements of the
Founding Fathers in establishing the noble ideals and
liberal political principles of liberty, equality, democracy,
and constitutionalism. However, they do not hesitate to
recognize that the Founding Fathers were flawed men,
some of whom even defended the institution of slavery,
while others continued to own slaves even after they saw
that it contradicted the founding ideals. Moreover, liberals
give equal weight to the story of American immigration,
recognizing that the nation’s founding principles made
room for newcomers who could come from anywhere and
become American simply by embracing those principles.
Identity as a set of principles seems more closely aligned
to a multicultural, rather than an ethnocultural view of the
nation.
While the above contrast somewhat over simplifies the
complexities of American national identity, it does
illustrate the fact that the question of American identity is
a highly contested one. Kaufmann (2000) has claimed that
the view of the U.S. as a civic nation is supported only if we
restrict our attention to developments that have occurred
since the 1960’s. According to Kaufmann, for almost its
entire history, the political and cultural elite defined the
U.S. in ethnic terms as white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant.
During periods of high immigration, this elite expended
great effort to assimilate immigrants to their own ethnic
ideal, and when the growth of immigrant populations
posed a challenge, defensive responses arose, including
restrictions to immigration. In fact, from 1920-1960, this
defensive response was institutionalized. After this long
period in which national quotas kept a tight lid on
immigration, the U.S. only became more open to
156 |

immigration again in 1965 with the passage of the
Immigration and Nationality Act.
The tendency, then, to see the U.S. as a civic nation of
immigrants is a recent historical development. Nor is the
U.S. exceptional in this respect. Rather, the U.S. is merely
part of a broader trend among “Western” nations to
redefine themselves in civic terms. In fact, Kaufmann
(2000: 31) cites research showing that contrary to popular
perceptions of the U.S. as a land of immigration, “Western
Europe … has had a higher immigrant population than the
United States since the 1970’s and by 1990 had
proportionately two to three times the number of foreignborn” as the United States.
Whether the post-1960’s immigration trends will
continue is currently in doubt across much of Western
Europe and the United States as evidenced by such events
as Great Britain’s decision in 2016 to withdraw from the
European Union, the rise of far-right challenges to liberal
European democracies, not to mention the 2016 U.S.
election, which has brought in a president that apparently
seeks to recreate immigration policies reminiscent of the
exclusionary pre-1965 era.

National identity
Earlier we suggested that anthropologists and sociologists
have moved from trying to establish the cultural features
that define groups to studying how the members of groups
self-identify. Political scientists have made similar moves
in their studies of nationalism. Rather than focusing wholly
on ethnocultural roots or civic transformations, the recent
trend among many scholars is to focus on the social and
psychological dynamics of national identity.
speaking of culture | 157

As the previous discussion suggests, some Americans,
despite clearly being citizens (by either birth or
naturalization) may be regarded by other Americans as
somehow less American than others. This might lead us
to ask whether individual Americans themselves differ in
the degree to which they embrace an American national
identity. And in fact, Theiss-Morse (2009), found this to be
the case. In an extensive study of American households,
Theiss-Morse concluded that Americans could be
distinguished from one another according to whether they
are strong, medium, or weak identifiers and that the
strength of national identity was also tied to other social
characteristics.
For example, compared with weak identifiers, strong
identifiers are more likely to be: older, Christian, less
educated, more trusting of others, and more likely to
identify with other social groups in general. On the other
hand, black Americans and Americans with extremely
liberal political views are less likely to claim a strong
American identity. Strong identifiers are also more likely
to describe themselves as “typical Americans.” People who
espouse a strong national identity are also more likely to set
exclusionary group boundaries on the national group—to
claim, for instance, that a “true American” is white, or
Christian, or native-born. In contrast, weak identifiers are
less likely to believe that their fellow Americans must
possess any particular qualities to be counted as American.
While Theiss-Morse has utilized social identity theory to
describe American social identity, she has also noted that,
of course, the same kind of analysis can be made of any
national identity, German, Japanese, Brazilian, etc.

158 |

Final reflection
The relationship between culture and group membership is
complicated. Whereas scholars once defined certain types
of groups, e.g. ethnic and racial groups, or national groups,
on the basis of shared culture, group membership is now
more likely to be seen as a matter of social identification.
Moreover, social identities are fluid rather than fixed and
are established by means of processes whereby group
members negotiate the boundaries of the group as well as
the degree to which they identify with valued groups.

Application
FOR FURTHER THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION

1. Do you identify with any particular ethnic group or groups? For
each group with which you identify, explain how members of the
group define themselves.
2. Do you think of yourself in terms of any racial identity? Explain.
3. How would you describe your national identity? How typical are
you of other people from your country? … a) very typical,
b) somewhat typical, or c) not very typical. … What makes you
typical or atypical?
4. Some people embrace more than one identity, or feel themselves to
have different identities in different social contexts. We can refer to
this as hybridity. Are you a person with a hybrid identity? If so, can
you elaborate on that experience?

Chapter 8: Roots of
American National Culture

Suggested Focus
This chapter is a crash course in American history from the perspective of
social history and cultural geography. If you can grasp the argument of this
chapter, you might begin to see American culture in a completely new light.

1. Name from memory as many as you can of the American beliefs
and values discussed at the beginning of the chapter.
2. What does Woodard mean when he says there are 11 nations in
North America? (What is a nation?)
3. Besides the English, which three other European powers
established a major presence in North America?
4. What makes New York the unique city that it is?
5. To which colonies does Albion’s Seed refer? From where did these
colonists come exactly? How was the understanding of “freedom”
different in each of those colonies?
6. From where did the founders of the Deep South come?
7. What happened during the Westward Expansion?

Preliminary remarks
The title of this chapter, The Roots of American Culture, may
require a bit of explaining; otherwise perhaps it may not
be apparent how the two parts of the chapter fit together.
Where does one look for the roots of a national culture?
This chapter suggests looking in two places. On one hand,
we might suppose those roots might be exposed if we
simply examine the beliefs and values that seem to animate
the culture as it lies before us in the present. This then is
how we begin this chapter on American national culture,
with a snapshot of American beliefs and values that have
been repeatedly identified by observers of the American
scene.
On the other hand, we suggest, perhaps this view is too
superficial, painting American culture in an overly
generalized, stereotypical way. We point out that there is
too much strife and political division in the United States to
suppose that the national culture can be so easily captured.
In fact, we question whether there is a “national culture”
at all and suggest that if we look at the founding and
settlement of the United States in historical perspective,
as we do throughout the remainder of the chapter, we see
not one national culture but many regional cultures. And
while an overwhelming majority of Americans may say
they hold dearly the value of “freedom,” if we look closely,
we begin to see that not all Americans understand freedom
in the same way. Once we realize this, we may be better
able to understand the obvious divisions in contemporary
American society.

166 |

American beliefs and values
As pointed out in the last chapter, it is a mistake to
automatically assume that everyone in a large multicultural
country like the U.S. shares a common culture. But this
hasn’t stopped many writers from suggesting that they do.
Among the most recent popular essays to address the
question of American beliefs and values is Gary Althen’s
“American Values and Assumptions.” Here is a list of the
beliefs and values that Althen (2003) identifies as typically
American:
• individualism, freedom, competitiveness and privacy
• equality
• informality
• the future, change and progress
• the goodness of humanity
• time
• achievement, action, work and materialism
• directness and assertiveness
In what follows, I summarize Althen’s description of
typical American values and assumptions, sometimes
extending his examples with my own.

Individualism
According to Althen (2003), “the most important thing to
understand about Americans is probably their devotion to
individualism. They are trained from very early in their
lives to consider themselves as separate individuals who

speaking of culture | 167

are responsible for their own situations . . . and . . .
destinies. They’re not trained to see themselves as
members of a close-knit interdependent family, religious
group, tribe, nation, or any other collectivity.”
Althen illustrates the above point by describing an
interaction he observed between a three-year-old boy and
his mother. They are at the mall, and the boy wants to know
if he can have an Orange Julius, (a kind of cold drink made
from orange juice and ice). The mother explains to him
that he doesn’t have enough money for an Orange Julius
because he bought a cookie earlier. He has enough for a
hot dog. Either he can have a hot dog now, she says, or he
can save his money and come back another day to buy an
Orange Julius.
Althen says that people from other countries often have
a hard time believing the story. They wonder, not just why
such a young child would have his own money, but how
anyone could reasonably expect a three-year-old to make
the kind of decision his mother has suggested. But
Americans, he says, understand perfectly. They know that
such decisions are beyond the abilities of three-year-olds,
but they see the mother as simply introducing the boy to
an American cultural ideal—that of making one’s own
decisions and being responsible for the consequences.

Freedom
Americans feel strongly about their freedom as individuals.
They don’t want the government or other authorities
meddling in their personal affairs or telling them what they
can and cannot do. One consequence of this respect for the
individuality of persons, Althen claims is that Americans
tend not to show the kind of deference to parents that
168 |

people in more family-oriented societies do. For example,
Americans think that parents should not interfere in their
children’s choices regarding such things as marriage
partners or careers. This doesn’t mean that children do not
consider the advice of parents; quite the contrary,
psychologists find that American children generally
embrace the same general values as their parents and
respect their opinions. It is just that Americans strongly
believe everyone should be free to choose the life he/she
wishes to live.

Competitiveness
The strong emphasis on individualism pushes Americans
to be highly competitive. Althen sees this reflected not only
in the American enthusiasm for athletic events and sports
heroes, who are praised for being “real competitors,” but
also in the competitiveness that pervades schools and
extracurricular activities. According to Althen, Americans
are continually making social comparison aimed at
determining:
. . . who is faster, smarter, richer, better looking; whose
children are the most successful; whose husband is the best
provider or the best cook or the best lover; which salesperson
sold the most during the past quarter; who earned his ﬁrst
million dollars at the earliest age; and so on.

Privacy
Americans assign great value to personal privacy, says
Althen, assuming that everyone needs time alone to reflect

speaking of culture | 169

or replenish his or her psychic energy. Althen claims that
Americans don’t understand people who think they always
have to be in the company of others. He thinks foreigners
are often puzzled by the invisible boundaries that seem to
surround American homes, yards, and offices, which seem
open and inviting but in fact are not. Privacy in the home is
facilitated by the tendency of American houses to be quite
large. Even young children may have bedrooms of their
own over which they are given exclusive control.

Equality
The American Declaration of Independence asserted
(among other things) that “all men are created equal.”
Perhaps most Americans are aware that equality is an ideal
rather than a fully realized state of affairs; nevertheless,
says Althen, most Americans “have a deep faith that in
some fundamental way all people . . . are of equal value, that
no one is born superior to anyone else.”

Informality
American social behavior is marked by extraordinary
informality. Althen sees this reflected in the tendency of
Americans to move quickly, after introductions, to the use
of first names rather than titles (like Mr. or Mrs.) with
family names. Americans, says Althen, typically interact in
casual and friendly ways. Informality is also reflected in
speech; formal speech is generally reserved for public
events and only the most ceremonious of occasions.
Similarly, Americans are fond of casual dress. Even in the
business world, where formal attire is the rule, certain
meetings or days of the week may be designated as

170 |

“business casual,” when it is acceptable to shed ties, suit
coats, skirts and blazers. Foreigners encountering
American informality for the first time may decide that
Americans are crude, rude, and disrespectful.

The Future, Change, and Progress
The United States is a relatively young country. Although
the first European colonies appeared in North America
nearly 400 years ago, the United States is only 230 years old
as I write these words. Perhaps this is why the U.S. tends
to seem less tied to the past and more oriented towards
the future. Moreover, the country has changed dramatically
since the time of its founding, becoming a major world
power only in the last 75 years.
To most Americans, science, technology and innovation
are more salient than history and tradition, says Althen.
Americans tend to regard change as good, and the new as
an improvement over the old. In other words, change is
an indication of progress. Americans also tend to believe
that every problem has a solution, and they are, according
to Althen, “impatient with people they see as passively
accepting conditions that are less than desirable.”

The Goodness of Humanity
Although some Americans belong to religious groups that
emphasize the inherent sinfulness of man, Althen claims
that the basic American attitude is more optimistic. For one
thing, the American belief in progress and a better future,
Althen argues, would not be possible if Americans did not
believe human nature was basically good, or at least that
people have it within their power to improve themselves.

speaking of culture | 171

The robust commercial literature of self-help or selfimprovement is another source of evidence for this
conviction.

Time
Americans regard time as a precious resource, says Althen.
They believe time should always be used wisely and never
wasted. Americans are obsessed with efficiency, or getting
the best possible results with the least expenditure of
resources, including time.

Achievement, Action, Work, and Materialism
American society is action oriented. Contemplation and
reflection are not valued much unless they contribute to
improved performance. Americans admire hard work, but
especially hard work that results in substantial
achievement. “Americans tend to define and evaluate
people,” says Althen, “by the jobs they have.” On the other
hand, “family backgrounds, educational attainments, and
other characteristics are considered less important.”
Americans have also been thought of as particularly
materialistic people, and there is no denying that American
society is driven by a kind of consumer mania. Material
consumption is widely seen as the legitimate reward for
hard work.

Directness and Assertiveness
Americans have a reputation for being direct in their
communication. They feel people should express their
opinions explicitly and frankly. As Althen expresses it,

172 |

“Americans usually assume that conflicts or disagreements
are best settled by means of forthright discussions among
the people involved. If I dislike something you are doing, I
should tell you about it directly so you will know, clearly and
from me personally, how I feel about it.”
Assertiveness extends the idea of directness in the
expression of opinion to the realm of action. Many
Americans are raised to insist upon their rights, especially
if they feel they have been treated unfairly, or cheated, e.g.,
in a business transaction. There is a strong tradition, for
example, of returning merchandise to retail stores, not only
if it is defective but even if it just does not live up to an
individual’s expectation as a customer. The retailer who
refuses to satisfy a customer’s demand to refund the cost
of an unacceptable product is likely to face a stiff argument
from an assertive or even angry customer. The customer
service personnel of major retailers tend, therefore, to be
quite deferential to customer demands.

Conclusion
In his discussions of American values and assumptions,
Althen is careful to point out that generalizations can be
risky—that it would be a mistake to think that all
Americans hold exactly the same beliefs, or even that when
Americans do agree, that they do so with the same degree
of conviction. He is also careful to note that the
generalizations represent the predominant views of white,
middle class people who have for a long time held a
majority of the country’s positions in business, education,
science and industry, politics, journalism, and literature.
He acknowledges that the attitudes of many of the nation’s
various ethnic minorities might differ from the values of
speaking of culture | 173

the “dominant” culture but insists that as long as we
recognize these limitations, it is reasonable to regard the
observations he offers as true on the average.
There may be a good deal of truth to Althen’s claim;
however, a closer look into American history reveals
considerable
regional
variation
in
Americans’
understanding of even the most fundamental ideals, e.g.,
ideas about the freedom of the individual. In Part 2, we will
see that a closer look at the American political scene, may
force us to conclude that even when Americans endorse
the same values, they may actually have different things in
mind.

A closer look at American cultural diversity
In this section, I want to show why the idea of a dominant
American culture is more complicated than it is often taken
to be. Listen to any serious political commentary on
American TV and sooner or later you will hear about the
radical polarization of American culture and politics.
Commentators may differ on whether we have always been
this way, or whether it is worse than ever, but journalists
and scholars alike are nearly unanimous in insisting that
the country is anything but unified. Every U.S. President at
the annual State of the Union Address says we are unified,
but that is something the President must say. “The state of
our Union is strong,” are the words traditionally uttered.
But does anyone believe it?

174 |

Figure 8.1. Woodard (2011) argues that there are 11 American nations
occupying the continental U.S.

And just when many of us think we have finally put the
American Civil War and the shameful legacy of slavery
behind us once and for all by electing the first black
president, the nation turns around and elects a successor
that surely has Abraham Lincoln turning over in his grave.
How is it possible? Essays like Althen’s certainly do not give
us any clue.
What could possibly explain it?
Perhaps we can find a clue in the work of cultural
geographers, historians, and journalists. Back to the
original question: Is there really a dominant American
culture? Depending upon whom you read, there is not one
unified American culture. Rather, at least four cultures
sprang from British roots, and altogether there may be as
many as eleven national cultures in the U.S. today. (See
Figure 8.1)

Understanding U.S. Cultural Landscapes
In 1831, 26-year old French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville
toured the United States. Four years later, he published
the first of two volumes of Democracy in America. At that
time, Tocqueville saw the United States as composed of
almost separate nations (Jandt, 2016). Since then, cultural
geographers have produced evidence to support many of
Tocqueville’s observations, noting that as various cultural
groups arrived in North America, they tended to settle
where their own people had already settled. As a result,
different regions of the U.S. came to exhibit distinctive
regional cultures. Zelinsky (1973) identified five distinctive
cultural regions while Bigelow (1980) identified no fewer
than nine. (See Table 8.1)

Table 8.1 Studies identifying U.S. regional cultures

Joel Garreau (1981), while an editor for the Washington
Post, also wrote a book proclaiming that the North
American continent is actually home to nine nations. Based
on the observations of hundreds of observers of the
American scene, Garreau begins The Nine Nations of North
America by urging his readers to forget everything they
learned in sixth-grade geography about the borders

176 |

separating the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, as well as all the
state and provincial boundaries within. Says Garreau:
Consider, instead, the way North America really works.
It is Nine Nations. Each has its capital and its distinctive
web of power and influence. A few are allies, but many
are adversaries. Some are close to being raw frontiers;
others have four centuries of history. Each has a peculiar
economy; each commands a certain emotional
allegiance from its citizens. These nations look
different, feel different, and sound different from each
other, and few of their boundaries match the political
lines drawn on current maps. Some are clearly divided
topographically by mountains, deserts, and rivers.
Others are separated by architecture, music, language,
and ways of making a living. Each nation has its own list
of desires. Each nation knows how it plans to get what
it needs from whoever’s got it. …Most important, each
nation has a distinct prism through which it views the
world. (Garreau, 1981: 1-2)

Historian David Hackett Fischer (1989) has argued that
U.S. culture is best understood as an uneasy coexistence of
just four original core cultures derived from four British
folkways, each hailing from a different region of 17th
century England. Most recently, journalist Colin Woodard
(2011) drawing on the work of Fischer and others has
identified eleven North American nations. In the sections
that follow, I hope to show why essays like Althen’s may
not be helpful for understanding American culture. In the
process, I will briefly recount the story of the settling of
North America for those who may not be entirely aware of
that history.
speaking of culture | 177

Officially, of course, only three countries, Canada, the
United States, and Mexico, occupy the entirety of North
America, and each country began as a European project.
The principal powers driving the settlement of the
continent were England, France, and Spain. All three
powers had a major presence in parts of what is now the
United States before the U.S. assumed its present shape.

Spanish influence
Spain was the first European power to insert itself into the
Americas, starting in the Caribbean islands after the arrival
of Christopher Columbus in 1492. Spain would eventually
dominate most of South America and Mexico and even
gain a temporary foothold in present day Florida as well as
much of the American Southwest and California.
By the time the ﬁrst Englishmen stepped off the boat at
Jamestown . . . Spanish explorers had already trekked through
the plains of Kansas, beheld the Great Smoky Mountains of
Tennessee, and stood at the rim of the Grand Canyon. They
had mapped the coast of Oregon . . . [and] established shortlived colonies on the shores of Georgia and Virginia. In 1565,
they founded St. Augustine, Florida, now the oldest European
city in the United States. By the end of the sixteenth century,
Spaniards had been living in the deserts of Sonora and
Chihuahua for decades, and their colony of New Mexico was
marking its ﬁfth birthday. (Woodard, 2011: 23)

The descendants of the first Spanish settlers in the
Southwest (many of whom intermarried with the
indigenous peoples) thought of this region as el Norte (the

178 |

north), and while Spanish influence on the West would
eventually be eclipsed by English folkways, Spanish
influences persist to this day.

French influence
While the Spanish spread out across the South and laid
claim to the West, the French dropped in from the North.
Frenchmen explored the coasts of Newfoundland and
sailed up the Saint Lawrence River in 1534. They sailed the
coasts of New Brunswick and Maine and established the
first successful French settlement in Nova Scotia in 1605,
followed by Quebec City in 1608 and Montreal in 1642. From
Montreal, the St. Lawrence River carried them to the Great
Lakes and from there by way of an extensive network of
rivers into the vast interior of the continent, the so-called
Louisiana territory. Following the great Mississippi River
down to the Gulf of Mexico, the French founded New
Orleans in 1718.
Moreover, the French established a more sympathetic
and human relationship with the native peoples than either
the Spanish or the English had. As Woodard (2011) has
observed, the Spanish enslaved the Indians; the English
drove them out; but the French settled near them, learned
their customs and established trading alliances “based on
honesty, fair dealing, and mutual respect” (p. 35)
The legacy of New France, as it was called, can still be
felt in isolated pockets of the U.S., like southern Louisiana
and the city of New Orleans, and also near the northern
boundaries of eastern states like Vermont and Maine.
Otherwise, it has a stronger pull on Canada where it
continues to resist domination by the English-speaking
regions of Canada. On the other hand, Spanish influences
speaking of culture | 179

are more widely felt in the United States, particularly in
South Florida and throughout the southwestern U.S. and
California. However, the dominant culture of the United
States—or as Fischer (1989) has argued—the four
dominant cultures are British.

Dutch influence
Another European power to establish a presence in North
America was the Netherlands. In 1624, the Dutch
established a fur trading post on what is today the Island
of Manhattan in New York City. In fact, Woodard (2011:
65) reminds us, the character of New York City is due very
much to the cultural imprint of the first Dutch settlers of
New York. Of course, it was not called New York back then
but New Amsterdam.
Unlike the Puritans who would come five years later, the
Dutch had no interest in creating a model society. Nor were
they interested in establishing democratic government.
During the first few decades of its existence, New
Amsterdam was formally governed by the Dutch West
India Company, one of the first global corporations. The
Dutch were interested in North America primarily for
commercial purposes.
To understand how the Dutch influenced New York, it is
important to understand the culture and social history of
the Netherlands. By the end of the 1500’s, the Dutch had
waged a successful war of independence against a huge
monarchical empire (the kingdom of Spain). They had
asserted the inborn human right to rebel against an
oppressive government, and they had established a
kingless republic nearly two centuries before the American

180 |

Revolution, which established American independence
from the British Empire.
“In the early 1600s, the Netherlands was the most
modern and sophisticated country on Earth,” says
Woodard (2011: 66-67). They were committed to free
inquiry. Their universities were among the best in the
world. Scientists and intellectuals from countries where
free inquiry was suppressed flocked to the Netherlands and
produced revolutionary scientific and philosophical texts.
Dutch acceptance of freedom of the press resulted in the
wide distribution of texts that were banned elsewhere in
Europe. The Dutch asserted the right of freedom from
persecution for the free exercise of religion. They produced
magnificent works of art and established laws and business
practices that set the standard for the Western world. They
invented modern banking, establishing the first
clearinghouse at the Bank of Amsterdam for the exchange
of the world’s currencies.
The Dutch had also virtually invented the global
corporation with the establishment of the Dutch East India
Company in 1602. With 10,000 ships of advanced design,
shareholders from all social classes, thousands of workers,
and global operations, the Netherlands dominated
shipping in northern Europe in the early 1600s.
By the time the Dutch West India Company founded New
Amsterdam, the Netherlands had assumed a role in the world
economy equivalent to that of the United States in the late
20th century, setting the standards for international business,
ﬁnance, and law. (Woodard, 2011: 67)

The Dutch effectively transplanted all of these cultural

speaking of culture | 181

achievements to New Amsterdam. Dutch openness and
tolerance consequently attracted a remarkable diversity of
people. The ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity, says
Woodard, shocked early visitors. The streets of New
Amsterdam teamed with people from everywhere, just as
New York does today.
By the mid 1600’s, there were “French-speaking Walloons;
Lutherans from Poland, Finland; and Sweden; Catholics from
Ireland and Portugal; and Anglicans, Puritans, and Quakers
from New England. . . [D]ozens of Ashkenazim [eastern
European Jews] and Spanish-speaking Sephardim [Jews from
Spain] settled in New Amsterdam in the 1650s, forming the
nucleus of what would eventually become the largest Jewish
community in the world. Indians roamed the streets, and
Africans—slave, free and half-free—already formed a ﬁfth of
the population. A Muslim from Morocco had been farming
outside the city walls for three decades. (Woodard, 2011: 66)

When the Duke of York, future King James II of England,
arrived with a naval fleet in 1664, the Dutch were forced
to cede political control of New Amsterdam to England.
New Amsterdam became New York. However, the Dutch
managed to negotiate terms, which enabled them to
maintain a presence and preserve Dutch norms and values.
Thus, diversity, tolerance, upward mobility, and the
emphasis on private enterprise, characteristics historically
associated with the United States in general and New York
in particular, began in New Amsterdam and represent the
Dutch legacy in America.

Albion’s Seed

Geographic origins of four English groups that colonized different
regions of North America

Of the three major European powers, the English were
latecomers. But when they finally came, they washed over
the continent like a tsunami. Today English cultural
influences prevail over vast areas of both Canada and the
United States.
In his book, Albion’s Seed, David Fischer argues that the
foundations of U.S. culture were laid between 1629-1775 by
four great waves of English-speaking immigrants. Each
wave brought a group of people from a different region of

184 |

England, and each group settled in a different region of
British America.
• The first wave (1629-1640) brought Puritans from the
East of England to Massachusetts.
• The second wave (1642-1675) brought a small Royalist
elite and large numbers of indentured servants from the
South of England to Virginia.
• The third wave (1675-1725) consisted of people from the
North Midlands of England and Wales. This group
settled primarily in the Delaware Valley.
• Finally, multiple waves of people arrived between
1718-1775 from the borders of North Britain and Ireland.
Most of these people settled in the mountains of the
Appalachian backcountry.
According to Fischer, despite all being English-speaking
Protestants living under British laws and enjoying certain
British “liberties,” each group came from a different
geographical region, and each region had its own
particular social, political, and economic circumstances. As
a result, the basic attitudes, behaviors, and values of each
group were profoundly different.

Massachusetts (Yankeedom)
The Puritans who founded Massachusetts Bay Colony were
not the first English settlers in New England; the so-called
Pilgrims beat them by about 10 years. But the
Massachusetts Bay Puritans left a more lasting legacy. The
Puritans came in greater numbers over an eleven-year
period (1629-1640), primarily from East Anglia. In the 17th

speaking of culture | 185

century, East Anglia was the most economically developed
area of Britain. East Anglians were artisans, farmers, and
skilled craftsmen; they were well educated and literate.
They had little respect for royal or aristocratic privilege. In
East Anglia, they had practiced local self-government by
means of elected representatives (selectmen) whom they
trusted to carry out the affairs of the community. They were
middle class and roughly all equal in material wealth.
When they migrated to Massachusetts, they brought
with them their own particular folkways. These included
many of the customs and values they had been accustomed
to in East Anglia. They were also deeply religious and
brought a utopian vision of a society that would bring
about God’s kingdom on earth, governed by a particular
Puritan interpretation of the Bible. They only accepted
people into their communities that were willing to conform
to their Puritan brand of Calvinism; dissenters were
punished or exiled.
On the other hand, according to Boorstin (1958), the
Puritans were completely non- utopian and practical in the
way they lived their daily lives. Because they considered
their theological questions answered, says Boorstin, they
could focus less on the ends of society and more on the
practical means for making society work effectively.
Eventually, historical circumstances would even sweep the
religious authoritarianism away, leaving behind a legacy
self-government, local control, and direct democracy.
As Woodard (2011) has observed, “Yankees would come
to have faith in government to a degree incomprehensible
to people of the other American nations.” New Englanders
trusted government to defend the public good against the
selfish schemes of moneyed interests. They were in favor
of promoting morality by prohibiting and regulating
186 |

undesirable activities. They believed in the value of public
spending on infrastructure and schools as a means for
creating a better society. Today, notes Woodard, “More
than any other group in America, Yankees conceive of
government as being run by and for themselves.” They
believe everyone should participate, and nothing makes
them angrier than the manipulation of the political process
for private gain (p. 60).

Virginia (Tidewater)
According to Fischer (1989) as the Puritan migrations were
coming to an end in 1641, a new migration was just about
to begin. This migration was from the south of England,
and these newcomers settled in what is today southeast
Virginia, in the area known as the Tidewater. The founders
of Virginia were about as different from the New England
Puritans as any group could be.
While the Puritans were artisans, farmers, and
craftsmen from the east of England, the Tidewater
Virginians had been English “gentlemen” in south
England. The economy of south England in 17th century
was organized mainly around the production of grain and
wool. While the Puritans enjoyed a fairly egalitarian life in
East Anglia, the south of England was marked by severe
economic inequality. Those who didn’t own land were
tenants. The region had also suffered greatly during the
English Civil War, a conflict that pitted the King of England
against the Parliament over the manner in which England
was to be governed. The landed gentry of south England
were Royalists; they supported the King. However, they
found themselves on the losing side of the conflict. Unlike
the Puritans who migrated to New England for religious
speaking of culture | 187

reasons, the Royalists hoped to escape their deteriorating
situation by seeking their fortunes in the New World. To
the extent that religion was important to them, they
embraced the Anglican Church of England, the same
church as the King of England.
Like the Puritans, the Royalists were not the first English
settlers in their respective region. The earliest Virginians
had founded the Jamestown Colony in 1607. Also, like the
Puritans, the Royalists turned out to be more successful
administrators than the settlers who had come before. But
while the Jamestown settlers had been incompetent in
many ways, they had set the stage for a successful
agricultural export industry based on tobacco (Woodard,
2011).
Tobacco was a very lucrative crop and Virginia was
perfect for growing it, but it was very labor-intensive. The
Virginians solved their labor problem by recruiting a large
workforce of desperate people from London, Bristol, and
Liverpool. In fact, poor newcomers greatly outnumbered
the Royalist elites; more than 75 percent of immigrants to
Virginia came as indentured servants. Two thirds were
unskilled laborers and most could not read or write. The
Royalists, in fact, succeeded in reproducing the conditions
that had existed in the south of England where they had
been the lords and masters of large estates, exploiting a
vast and permanent underclass of poor, uneducated
Englishmen. Even worse, when the Virginians began losing
their workforce because the servants completed their
indentures, they turned to slave labor, which would
eventually spread across the entire southern United States.
Before the abolition of slavery in 1865, millions of Africans
would be kidnapped and shipped to the New World (and

188 |

later bred In America) as permanent property (Woodard,
2011).
As Fischer (1989) has pointed out, people everywhere in
British America embraced the ideal of liberty (freedom) in
one form or another; however, it would be a mistake to
think that liberty had the same meaning to New
Englanders as it did to Virginians. New Englanders
believed in ordered liberty, which meant that liberty
belonged not just to an individual but to an entire
community. In other words, an individual’s liberties or
rights were not absolute but had to be balanced against the
public good. New Englanders voluntarily agreed to accept
constraints upon their liberties as long as they were
consistent with written laws and as long as it was they
themselves that collectively determined the laws. It is also
true though that because the original Puritan founders saw
themselves as God’s chosen people, they did not at first feel
compelled to extend freedom to anyone outside of their
Puritan communities.
The Virginians, in contrast, embraced a form of liberty
that Fischer has described as hegemonic or hierarchical
liberty. According to Fischer (1989) freedom for the
Virginian was conceived as “the power to rule, and not to be
overruled by others. . . . It never occurred to most Virginia
gentlemen that liberty belonged to everyone” (pp. 411-412).
Moreover, the higher one’s status, the greater one’s
liberties. While New Englanders governed themselves by
mutual agreement arrived at in town hall meetings,
Virginian society was ruled from the top by a small group of
wealthy plantation owners who completely dominated the
economic and political affairs of the colony.

speaking of culture | 189

Delaware Valley (The Midlands)
The third major wave of English immigration took place
between 1675-1725 and originated from many different
parts of England, but one region in particular stood
out—the North Midlands, a rocky and sparsely settled
region inhabited by farmers and shepherds. The people had
descended from Viking invaders who had colonized the
region in the Middle Ages. They favored the Norse customs
of individual ownership of houses and fields and resented
the imposition of the Norman system of feudal manors,
which the southern Royalists had embraced (p.446). The
most peculiar thing about the people was their religion.
They were neither Puritans like the people of eastern
England, nor Anglican like the Royalists of the south, but
Quaker, or as they called themselves Friends.
The Quakers began arriving in great numbers in 1675,
settling in the Delaware Valley, spreading out into what
is today western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
Sandwiched between Puritan Massachusetts and Royalist
Virginia, Woodward (2011) refers to this region as the
Midlands.
By 1750, the Quakers had become the third largest
religious group in the British colonies (Fischer, p. 422). Like
the Puritans and unlike the Royalists, the Quakers sought
to establish a model society based on deeply held religious
beliefs. But whereas the Puritans tended restrict the
liberties of outsiders, even persecuting them, the Quakers
(under the leadership of William Penn) “envisioned a
country where people of different creeds and ethnic
backgrounds could live together in harmony” (Woodard,
p. 94). The Quakers would not impose their religion on
anyone but would invite everyone into the community who

190 |

accepted their worldview. They extended the right to vote
to almost anyone and provided land on cheap terms. They
maintained peace with the local Indians, paid them for
their land, and respected their interests.
Quakers held government to be an absolute necessity
and were intensely committed to public debate. At the same
time, they developed a tradition of minimal government
interference in the lives of people. The Quaker view of
liberty was different from that of both the Puritans and
the Royalists. While the Puritans embraced ordered or
bounded liberty for God’s chosen few, and the Royalists
embraced a hierarchical view of liberty for the privileged
elite (and who saw no contradiction in the keeping of
slaves), the Quakers believed in reciprocal liberty, a liberty
that they believed should embrace all of humanity. The
Quakers were the most egalitarian of the three colonies
discussed so far, and they would be among the most
outspoken opponents of slavery.

Appalachia
The last great waves of folk migration came between
1718-1775 from the so-called borderlands of the British
Empire, Ireland, Scotland, and the northern counties of
England. They were a clan-based warrior people whose
ancestors had endured 800 years of almost constant
warfare with England (Woodard, p. 101). Unlike the
Puritans or the Quakers who dreamed of establishing
model societies based upon their religious beliefs, or the
Royalists who wished to regain their aristocratic wealth
and privilege, the Borderlanders sought to escape from
economic privation: high rents, low wages, heavy taxation,
famine and starvation.
speaking of culture | 191

These new immigrants landed on American shores
primarily by means of Philadelphia and New Castle in the
Quaker Midlands, mainly because of the Quaker policy of
welcoming immigrants. Unfortunately, the Borderlanders,
proved too belligerent and violent for the peace-loving
Quakers, who tried to get them out of their towns and into
the Appalachian backcountry as quickly as possible. The
Appalachian Mountains extend for 800 miles from
Pennsylvania to Georgia and several hundred miles east
to west from the Piedmont Plateau to the Mississippi. The
Borderlanders would end up spreading their folkways
throughout this vast region.
While the other three colonial regions established
commercial enterprises revolving around cash groups and
manufactured goods, the Borderlanders lived primarily by
hunting, fishing, and farming. In Britain, they had never
been accustomed to investing in fixed property because it
was too easily lost in war. In the American backcountry,
they carried on in the same way; whatever wealth they had
was largely mobile, consisting of herds of pigs, cattle, and
sheep. They practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, moving
to new lands every few years when they had depleted the
soil in one place. In time, some individuals managed to
acquire large tracts of land, while others remained landless.
The result was to reproduce the pervasive inequality that
had existed in the northern English borderlands.
Early on, Appalachia acquired a reputation as a violent
and lawless place. In the earliest years of settlement, there
was little in the way of government. To the extent that there
was any order or justice, it was according to the principle
lex talionis, which held that “a good man must seek to do
right in the world, but when wrong was done to him, he

192 |

must punish the wrongdoer himself by an act of
retribution. . .” (Fischer, p. 765).
The people that settled Appalachia held to an ideal of
liberty that Fischer has called “natural liberty,”
characterized by a fierce resistance to any form of external
restraint and “strenuously hostile to ordering institutions”
(Fischer, p. 777). This included hostility to organized
churches and established clergy. The Appalachian
backcountry was a place of mixed religious denominations,
just as the borders of North Britain had been. However,
if there was a dominant denomination, it may have been
Scottish Presbyterianism.
In essence, the Borderlanders reproduced many aspects
of the society they had left behind in the British
borderlands, a society marked by economic inequality, a
culture of violence and retributive justice, jealous
protection of individual liberty, and distrust of
government. A more different culture from that of New
England or the Midlands is hard to imagine. Except
perhaps for the Deep South.

speaking of culture | 193

Englanders from Barbados
The Deep South

Popularly regarded as the cultural boundary separating North and
South (Dixie)

Fischer does not deal with the founders of the Deep South
in Albion’s Seed for the simple reason that none of them
came directly from England as the Puritans, Virginians,
Quakers, and Borderlanders had. Instead, they were in
Woodard’s words “the sons and grandsons of the founders
of an older English colony: Barbados, the richest and most
horrifying society in the English-speaking world” (p. 82).
The colonizers of Barbados had established a wealthy and
powerful plantation economy based on sugar cane, grown
entirely by means of a brutal system of slave labor. Having
run out of land on Barbados, it became necessary for
Barbadians to find new lands, which they did by migrating

194 |

to other islands in the Caribbean and to the east coast of
North America.
The Barbadians arrived near present day Charleston,
South Carolina in 1670 and set to work replicating a slave
state almost identical to the one they had left behind in
Barbados. They bought enslaved Africans by the boatloads
and put them to work growing rice and indigo for export to
England. They often worked them to death just as they had
in Barbados. They built a tremendous amount of wealth
from this slave labor, and most of it was concentrated in the
hands of a few ruling families who comprised only about
one quarter of the white population. They governed the
territory solely to serve their own interests, ignoring the
bottom three-quarters of the white population, and of
course the black majority who actually made up 80 percent
of the population. The brutality of the system is certainly
shocking to modern sensibilities, and it was even shocking
to the Barbadian’s contemporaries.
While slavery was initially tolerated in all of the colonies,
it was an organizing economic principle only in the
Tidewater region and the Deep South. However, there were
important differences. Initially, the Tidewater leaders had
imported labor in the form of indentured servants both
white and black. Indentured servants could earn their
freedom, and many blacks did. In the Tidewater, slaves
outnumbered whites by only 1.7 to 1, and the slave
population grew naturally after 1740, eliminating the need
to import slaves. And because there were few newcomers,
the black population of the Tidewater was “relatively
homogenous and strongly influenced by the English
culture it was embedded within” (Woodard, p. 87). Having
African heritage did not necessarily make someone a slave

speaking of culture | 195

in the Tidewater. People in the Tidewater found it harder to
deny the humanity of black people.
In the Deep South, however, the black population
outnumbered the white population by about 5 to 1, and
blacks lived largely apart from whites. Moreover, the
separation of whites and blacks was strictly enforced, and
the white minority thought of blacks as inherently inferior.
Because they were so greatly outnumbered, Southern
plantation owners also feared the possibility of a violent
rebellion, and they organized militias and conducted
training exercises in case they might need to respond to
an uprising. “Deep Southern society,” says Woodard, “was
not only militarized, caste-structured, and deferential to
authority, it was also aggressively expansionist” (p. 90).
Unfortunately, the slaveholding practices of the Deep
South eventually caught hold in the Tidewater too. By the
middle of the 18th century, permanent slavery came to be
the norm everywhere south of the Mason-Dixon line.

The Westward Expansion
After the American Revolution, four of the nations that we
have just surveyed headed west: New England, the
Midlands, Appalachia, and the Deep South all raced
towards the interior of the continent apparently with little
mixing. Figure 8.1 shows the territories that each nation
settled. Woodard’s argument and the work of cultural
geographers suggests that these four nations carried their
particular folkways and cultural attitudes with them and
that the states they settled still bear those same cultural
markings.

196 |

The Far West
The cultural migrations were halted for a time by the sheer
extremity of the West, which was not well suited to
farming. Only two groups braved the arid West. The
Mormons hailed from Yankee roots. Like the New England
Puritans, two centuries earlier, they set out on a utopian
religious mission, and began arriving in the 1840s on the
shores the Great Salt Lake in present day Utah. “With a
communal mind-set and intense group cohesion,” notes
Woodard, “the Mormons were able to build and maintain
irrigation projects that enabled small farmers in the region
to survive in far Western conditions.” Interestingly, the
Mormon values of communitarianism, morality, and good
works are all Yankee values. One wonders sometimes why
Utah politicians seem to align themselves so often with
politicians espousing values more typical of Appalachia and
the Deep South rather than with New England.
The other hardy souls to venture into the Far West were
the Forty-niners, so named after the year 1849 which
brought a flood of frontiersmen to California seeking gold.
Otherwise, the West was successfully settled only after the
arrival of corporations and the federal government, the
only two forces capable of providing an infrastructure that
would eventually permit widespread settlement.
Westerners would come to resent both the corporations
and the federal government as unwelcome intrusions in
their lives.

The Left Coast
“Why is it,” asks Woodard, “that the coastal zone of
northern California, Oregon and Washington seems to

speaking of culture | 197

have so much more in common with New England than
with the other parts of those states?” The explanation,
according to Woodard, is that the first Americans to
colonize it were New England Yankees who arrived by ship.
New Englanders were well positioned to colonize the area
having become familiar with the region as New France’s
main competitor in the fur trade.
The first Yankee settlers were merchants, missionaries,
and woodsmen. They arrived determined to create a “New
England on the Pacific.” The other group to settle the
region consisted of farmers, prospectors and fur traders
from Greater Appalachia. They arrived overland by wagon,
and took control of the countryside, leaving the coastal
towns and government to the Yankees. The Yankee desire
to reproduce New England was ultimately unsuccessful
because as ever more migrants arrived from the
Appalachian Midwest and elsewhere, the Yankees were
outnumbered fifteen to one. They did manage, however, to
maintain control over most civic institutions.
Today the region shares with coastal New England the
same Yankee idealism and faith in good government and
social reform blended with Appalachian self-sufficient
individualism.

Final reflection
While these various European founders of the United
States were working out their destinies, the U.S. was also
a destination for immigrants from all over the world.
Throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, the
majority of immigrants were from Europe, first from
northern and western Europe, then from southern and
eastern Europe, and then once again from western Europe.
198 |

From the 1960s on, the majority of immigrants have come
from Asia and Latin America.
Given the passage of time and the huge influx of
immigrants, it might not seem believable that these
founding nations would have maintained their distinct
cultural identities. Haven’t they surely been diluted and
transformed, asks Woodard, by the tens of millions of
immigrants moving into the various regions? It might
seem, says Woodard, that by now these original cultures
must have “melted into one another, creating a rich,
pluralistic stew.”
However, cultural geographers such as Zelinsky (1973)
have found reasons to believe that once the settlers of a
region leave their cultural mark, newcomers are more likely
to assimilate the dominant culture of the region. The
newcomers surely bring with them their own cultural
legacies, foods, religions, fashions, and ideas, suggests
Woodard, but they do not replace the established ethos.
In American Nations, Woodard argues that the divisions
in American politics can be understood in large part by
understanding the cultural divisions that have been part of
the United States since its founding. These divisions can
help us understand regional differences in basic
sentiments such trust vs. distrust of government. They can
also help us understand why certain regions of the country
are for or against gun control, environmental regulation, or
the regulation of financial institutions, and so on, or for or
against particular Congressional legislation.

Chapter 2: Supplementary
Taxonomy – A very incomplete illustration
Biologists have constructed various systems of classification to organize the
relationships between organisms. Most traditional is the Linnaean system,
invented by Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778). Here three domains (proposed by
Carl Woese) appear above an otherwise traditional Linnaean scheme,
which placed Kingdoms at the top. Biologists have proposed 3-7
Kingdoms—exactly how many is a matter of debate; here we show three.
Each Kingdom consists of numerous Phyla; each Phylum has many Classes,
and so on.

Every organism has a unique scientific name consisting of genus and
species. For example, the common chimpanzee is Pan troglodytes, while we
modern humans are Homo sapiens. When necessary, biologists add a
subspecies designation. For instance, some biologists argue that wolves and
dogs are really one species, so the grey wolf is Canus lupus lupus, while the
domestic dog is Canus lupus familiaris.

NOTE: The Linnaean system classifies organisms based on morphology and
does not represent evolutionary relationships. In more modern,
phylogenetic (or cladistic) systems, evolutionary relations are taken into
account along with morphology.
