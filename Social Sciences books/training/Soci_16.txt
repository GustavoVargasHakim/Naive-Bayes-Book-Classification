These intercultural learning modules will develop
your understanding of cultural difference, diversity
and the critical perspectives that will add a new and
important dimension to your international experience.
Intercultural learning requires more than developing
your understanding of cultural customs or dos and
don’ts. These modules will challenge you to think about
the deeper issues of culture, race, imperialism,
white privilege and cultural diversity that underpin
all intercultural interactions. Intercultural learning
also requires learning about ourselves. Approach these
modules with an open mind and be prepared to critically
reflect on your own perspectives, which shape your
interpretation of intercultural experiences. Developing
this critical perspective will prepare you to remain open
to cultural difference, an important skill to establish as
you set off on your intercultural experience.

Why an eBook on intercultural learning?

What this eBook isn’t….

And what it is….

This book emerged as a result of our own experiences
of preparing students for international study
opportunities, as well as insights from research that we
have conducted into international student exchange
in Australia. We recognised that while there were
some excellent resources available that addressed the
practical aspects of such preparation, and some useful
material on location-specific cultural issues, there was
little available to support students in developing a more
‘critical’ approach to preparing for international study
experiences. It is our strongly held belief that such
a critical approach helps to ensure that students are
not merely ‘tourists’ passively experiencing another
culture, but rather have the tools to actively engage in
an exploration of the complex dynamics of culture and,
through critical reflection, to link this new understanding
to their own experience.

This intercultural learning eBook is not intended to
provide guidance on the practical aspects of preparation
for international study experiences. Support in
ensuring that travellers are aware of issues relating to
passports, visas, travel medicine etc., is important, but
best provided by those organising the specific travel
opportunity. This resource is also not intended as a
replacement for location-specific cultural information
and preparation. Learning about the culture of your
destination, including appropriate cultural etiquette,
is an important aspect of pre-travel preparation, and a
range of other freely available resources do a good job
of providing this information. This eBook isn’t therefore
intended as a stand-alone resource that addresses all
aspects of student preparation.

This resource is intended to equip students with a
‘critical lens’ through which their preparation process
and experience of international travel can be viewed.
A critical lens allows students to apply a deeper and
more complex analysis to their experiences, and,
when combined with a critically reflective approach,
to enhance their learning about culture and its context.
Such a critical lens inevitably requires reflection not just
on the culture of others, but on our own cultural identity
and positioning – both at home and when abroad. This
intercultural learning resource therefore sits alongside
the traditional practical and location-specific aspects of
preparation for international travel and is intended to
complement and extend these rather than replace them.

The learning style in these modules is
approached from an ‘adult’ learning
perspective. Your wealth of existing
knowledge and experience informs
your learning, and your encounters
with new concepts and information is
inevitably ‘filtered’ through the lens of
that experience. Forming connections
between the ‘existing’ and the ‘new’
is therefore an important part of
intercultural learning.

UN D E R ST AN D IN G CU L T U R E
& C UL T UR AL D IFFER ENCE
The ability to recognise and understand your own
cultural context is seen as an essential prerequisite for
understanding and interacting with people from different
cultural backgrounds. Let’s begin by grappling with the
idea of culture itself.
This module examines the highly nuanced,
multi-dimensional, and dynamic nature of the concept
of culture. The concept of culture is contested1, as it
can mean different things to different people and in
different contexts. Part of the difficulty in arriving at a
comprehensive definition stems from the fact that when
talking about culture we are usually referring to a rather
limited ‘visible’ dimension (such as language, works
of art, dress, etc.), and not necessarily considering the
rather large ‘invisible’ area of concepts and ideas (such
as values, attitudes, and worldviews).
An iceberg is often used as a metaphor for culture; on the
surface we are able to see the more obvious aspects of
culture, however, there are many aspects that lie deeper
and require time and critical thinking to comprehend.

Common misconceptions of culture can be created by
using definitions that limit understandings of culture to
discrete and readily identifiable categories.1
Consider these three different ways of defining culture:
… the eight major factors which set groups apart from
one another, and which give individuals and groups
elements of identity: age, class, race, ethnicity, levels of
ability, language, spiritual belief systems, educational
achievement, and gender differences.3
… an abstract concept that refers to learned and shared
patterns of perceiving and adapting to the world. Culture
is reflected in its products: the learned, shared beliefs,
values, attitudes, and behaviours that are characteristic
of a society or population. Culture is not a static
phenomenon; it is dynamic and ever-changing, but it
maintains a sense of coherence.4
Culture in its widest sense can be understood as a specific
way of thinking, acting and feeling about one’s own
actions and the actions of others. This includes conscious
or underlying explanations of the world and one’s own
and other people’s place within it. It also encompasses
beliefs, faiths, ideologies and worldviews, which we call
upon to assert reality, truths, values and ideas of good and
bad. Culture as a group phenomenon develops further and
changes according to changes in society. Culture as the
property of an individual is open to further development
depending on knowledge and experience.5

What do you notice about these three
definitions of culture?

These definitions highlight differences between
narrow and broad conceptualisations of culture. The
first definition captures the factors that most people
probably recognise and take into consideration when
thinking about culture. By contrast, the second definition
suggests a more expansive and inclusive view of culture.
Similarly, the final definition emphasises culture’s
existence as a variable and fluid construct, both on a
group and individual level.
In the last two definitions, culture is understood as
dynamic and relational, multi-dimensional, and expansive.
The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESC0) stresses (as UNESCO is one
organisation) the importance of understanding cultures
not as ‘self-enclosed or static entities’; rather:
Cultures are like clouds, their confines ever changing,
coming together or moving apart … and sometimes
merging to produce new forms arising from those that
preceded them, yet differing from them entirely … Culture
is the very substratum of all human activities, which
derive their meaning and value from it.6

of culture? Has your idea of culture
shifted? If so, in what way?

What are the differences and
similarities in the definitions?
Which definitions capture the visible
aspects of culture and which capture
the invisible?

Key point

Avoid falling into a very limited and narrow
understanding of what we mean when we talk
about culture. Dynamic and fluid approaches to
defining culture have a much better chance of
capturing a sense of the complex, changing and
multi-dimensional nature of this concept.
1

Culture is relational and fluid, providing
frames of reference for negotiating the
world.

2

Culture is systemic, occurring within,
between, and across individuals, families,
communities, and regions.

3

Each individual carries culture – culture is
not simply a construct applied to ‘others’
apart from ‘us’.

4

Culture embodies heterogeneity, carries
temporal qualities, and cannot be
singularised.2

In other words, when we begin to recognise the complexity of culture, it becomes
apparent that ways of thinking about culture which tend to oversimplify, reduce
and homogenise cultures are inadequate. If we are interested in understanding
our own culture, and in learning about the cultures of other people, an approach
that recognises and values this complexity is a valuable starting point.

TI C
r P e r s p e c ti v e ( E

Given culture is dynamic, complex and prone to generalisation, the notion of
intercultural competence is critiqued by a number of authors. Competence
“refers to the ability to do something successful or efficiently. The focus remains
on what people do rather than on the knowledge they have”.8 Practitioners should
question the idea of the ‘cultural expert’ and challenge top-down, outsider, or etic
approaches to understanding culture. Alternatively, an emic approach, or from
within, entails collaborative processes where both outsiders and insiders are
changed by cultural interactions. This requires developing greater awareness
of self, sharing knowledge, creating partnerships and acknowledging issues of
power, racism and the dynamic nature of culture.

tsi
de

While we have now developed some understanding of culture and cultural
difference, we need to be aware of the limitations to fully understand other
cultures. We need to recognise the plurality of cultures and be aware of any
tendencies towards essentialism, or generalisations that reduce complex
and dynamic cultures to some key definitive factors.7 Essentialism of culture
minimises the internal differences within that culture. The challenge is to
recognise and embrace diversity through respect and inclusion rather than a
process of exclusion.8

your own culture by answering the following questions:

Q4 How would you describe the source of your values
– are they religious values, social values, personal
values, professional values?
Q5 Can you see a connection between these values
and the institutions that have moulded and

from yours?
Q8 Is your culture determined by your family origin or
is it grounded in where you were born?

OR
Q1 How would you describe yourself as a ‘cultural
being’?
Q2 How is reality understood in your particular
culture? Is it viewed as dualistic or holistic?
Q3 What is the concept of self in your particular
culture? Is it viewed as a separate or
interconnected part of the natural, non-human
world?
Q4 What are some of the key historical events that
have shaped your cultural concept of self or in
other words, your ‘cultural being’?

Q1 What is your culture?

Q5 What is the concept of time? Is it viewed as linear,
circular, segmented, or future-oriented?

Q2 What are the most important features of your
culture?

Q6 What is the concept of relationships, including the
differences in gender roles?

Q3 How have your values been moulded and shaped

It’s not change or technology that threatens the integrity
of the ‘ethnosphere’… it is power … the crude face of

I M PE RI A LI SM A ND
CULTURAL DI VE RSI TY

The previous module introduced you to some different
and more inclusive ways of thinking about culture. Key
to these was the idea that culture is complex and multidimensional and that we should resist ways of thinking
about culture which are over-simplistic, narrow and
reductionist.

The concept of imperialism is used across disciplines,
often with meanings that are taken for granted.
Imperialism tends to be used in at least four different
ways when describing the form of European imperialism
which ‘started’ in the fifteenth century:

We now begin to turn our attention to some of the
broader issues that are essential in developing a
sophisticated and critical understanding of culture. This
unit explores the historical and continuing impact of
imperialism on cultural diversity. Imperialism is itself
a complex concept, but the relationship between culture,
cultural diversity and imperialism is so significant that
grappling with this idea is very important.
A note on terminology

1

Imperialism as economic expansion.

2

Imperialism as the subjugation of ‘others’.

3

Imperialism as an idea or spirit with many
forms of realisation.

4 Imperialism as a discursive field of
knowledge.12

While the concepts of imperialism and colonialism
are interconnected, the terms should not be seen
as synonymous. Rather, it is generally agreed that
colonialism is but one expression of imperialism,
“a particular realisation of the imperial imagination”.12

Imperialism can be defined as a policy of extending
a country’s power or influence through colonisation,
military force, economic control, or other means13.
It is these ‘other means’, which are the primary concern
of this unit, and arguably which constitute the primary
manifestation of imperialism in the contemporary world.
These ‘other means’ of extending a country’s power or
influence are commonly captured by the concept of
cultural imperialism.
As its name suggests, cultural imperialism refers
to the cultural aspects of imperialism. To attempt to
define cultural imperialism would require a broadly
accepted view of both culture and imperialism. Yet as
we know from the previous unit, a full appreciation of
the complex, dynamic, and nuanced nature of culture
defies a simple or uncontroversial definition. In its
broadest sense, the concept of cultural imperialism
“seems to mean that the process of imperialist control
is aided and abetted by importing supportive forms of
culture”.14 This can include the transmission of ideas and
ways of thinking from one culture to another, when this
transmission has the effect of privileging a dominant
cultural perspective. This is not limited to the human
service or helping professions but can also include
the environmental movement, business and science
based professions.

Many academics across the globe have expressed
concern about the forces of cultural imperialism in
international professional work.15, 16, 17, 18 For example,
social work writers have been raising awareness of the
problematic dominance of Western influences, stressing
the need for social work to free itself from the in-built
assumptions and cultural biases of Western theories and
models of practice.15 There is concern that Western ideas
of social work, such as a focus on individual needs and
the priority afforded scientific evidence, are exported
to other settings and cultural contexts, and can create a
form of cultural imperialism.

Similarly, within the environmental management
discipline, green grabbing or “resource alienation
in the name of the environment”19 is another form
of imperialism. Alienation of people from their land
can occur through complete removal of access or the
introduction of new rules around access (such as notions
of land ownership) and management of resources.
Local people are sometimes constructed as outdated
environmental destructors who require correction

environmental imperialism is combined with power and
privilege to justify sacrifices of the livelihood of ‘the few’,
usually impoverished communities, for the perceived
benefit of global society.

At times, the contradictions of
imperialism are difficult to identify
and, in a sense, require us to hold
a mirror to our own cultural practices. Read
this article by Janice Boddy which highlights
the irony of Western campaigns to abolish the
practice of female genital cutting in Africa that
have occurred at the same time as increasing
demand for labiaplasty in the US and UK. Boddy
argues that these practices “vividly expose the
similarities between “us” and African “others”.20

Refer back to our earlier module on
culture. How might emic approaches
help us to hold up a mirror to our
own cultural practices, to see the similarities
between ourselves and ‘others’ and to challenge
ideas of the superiority of the external ‘expert’?
What might some processes to develop more
collaborative understandings look like?

Entrenched notions that Western ideology and practices
are superior continue to reign across the globe.18 The
exportation of Western knowledge, values and beliefs
can be seen to help to sustain hegemony and control.15,
18, 21
This issue will be re-visited and explored further
in Module 5. For now, it is sufficient to stress that the
concept of cultural imperialism is usually used as a
negative, pejorative term across various disciplines
and endeavours. As you can imagine, if one culture or
cultural perspective is privileged above others this can

lead to the diminishing and devaluing of other cultures.
Therefore, one of the key reasons frequently suggested
for opposing any form of cultural imperialism is that of
the preservation of cultural diversity.

shared principles of our common humanity.5 Inclusion
is important not only across communities but within
communities where diversity will also exist.11 Promotion
of cultural diversity is a universal human right.6

WHY PRE SE RVE
CULTURAL DI VE RSI TY?

As you become increasingly familiar with the concept
of imperialism, particularly cultural imperialism, you
may begin to see evidence of it in many places around
you. The privileging of one culture over another and the
increasing dominance of one set of cultural features
and beliefs over others has been identified as one of
the features of modern globalisation. We need to
become conscious of this dynamic and begin to adopt
a critically aware approach to thinking about our own
role in this process.

Cultural diversity has always been a distinctive feature

of most societies worldwide. Political systems and
movements of various persuasions and forms have often
tried to deny this. This was most notable in the 19th
and 20th centuries where exploitative and oppressive
imperialist policies and practices permeated the
globe, particularly in the form of Western political and
economic domination in so-called ‘developing’ countries.
UNESCO suggests that cultural diversity should be
defined “as the capacity to maintain the dynamic of
change in all of us, whether individuals or groups”.6
Diversity is one of the core concepts of intercultural
learning. This concept recognises that cultural
difference, or diversity, is valuable and worthy
of protection.

White supremacy is the unnamed political system that has
made the modern world what it is today.22

As emphasised in the first two units, how we conceptualise
and thus understand concepts and words matter:

It is difficult to travel very far along the path of cultural
understanding, and in particular an understanding
of cultural difference, without running up against the
issues of racism and privilege. A significant challenge
in understanding the nature and impact of racism and
privilege is being open to examining our own experience
of these issues. In this unit, we’ll explore the ways in
which racism and privilege impact upon individuals’
life choices and experiences, the contentious concepts
of ‘race’ and racism, and the interconnected concepts of
power and privilege.

Words indicate understandings of reality, shape interactions
within discourses that produce them, and expose specific
conceptualisations of power relations and people’s place
in the world. They also influence actions taken. [Therefore]
questioning words and meanings is more than arguing about
semantics.23

RA CI S M AN D L IFE CHO ICES
Our previous unit discussed the processes of
imperialism and colonisation, which enabled European
countries to expand their rule. A key consequence is the
ongoing destruction of people’s ways of life, or in its most
extreme form, cultural genocide.
Alongside these imperialist ventures, racialisation also
ensued, where colonised peoples were positioned as
inferior. This process was extended across the planet and
became embedded in countries colonised by Europeans,
resulting in a redistribution of world resources through
the politicisation of biological attributes. In other words,
racist beliefs were used to justify the exercise of power
in many areas of life, producing dramatic negative
economic and social impacts for many peoples around
the world. The ideology of racism continues to permeate
various contemporary socio-economic and cultural
contexts across the globe.17, 23

For example, the United Nations International
Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial
Discrimination defines racial discrimination as:
Any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based
on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which
has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the
recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of
human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political,
economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.24

Although the above definition is clearly valuable in
placing racism within the context of Human Rights, it
nonetheless “suffers from the traditional assumption that
race is something that exists and has a scientific basis”,
a point worthy of further consideration.25
‘Race’ and ‘racism’ are contentious concepts that are
often used interchangeably. It is indeed indisputable
that all human beings belong to the same race –
Homo sapiens. Yet historically, the meaning of race
has varied. Early definitions focussed on a racialised
hierarchy based on physical attributes, particularly
skin colour. Later definitions focussed on allegedly
different intelligence levels that favoured white skin.
Unsurprisingly, this theory has since been thoroughly
discredited. However, the misconception of race as
a biological entity has recently acquired a new lease

2

3

of life through genetic biology and socio-biology.
These disciplines seek to explain variations in human
physicality and behaviour through genomes. But again,
it is “the politicisation of this biologically based process
… that results in racism, whilst further exposing its
socially constructed basis”.23
Racism is a set of economic, political and ideological
practices whereby a dominant group exercises hegemony
over subordinate groups.26

Racism is a reactionary concept “founded upon the
scientifically false premises that there are physical
and psychological inequalities between human races,
and that the social and cultural history of mankind is
dependent upon these racial distinctions”.27 The way
in which this reaction can emerge may be through
more overt expressions of discrimination or exclusion,
however, new forms of racism can be taken for granted
in aspects of daily life. For example, racism can appear
in the form of a narrow construction of Australian
identity or way of life, that excludes minority groups.28
Racism may also be expressed through institutional
or systemic discrimination, yet these forms continue
to “impact strongly on the life chances of individuals
who are not part of the mainstream”.25 As these forms
of racism are more difficult to prove and identify,
covert racism remains a pervasive part of our society.29

Hidden forms of racism

Racism has three inter-related and interactive
components that are embedded in, and negotiated
through the minutiae of everyday life: personal;
institutional; and cultural.23 Critical race theorists

understanding of racism: that racism interacts and
intersects with other forms of oppression, such as
classism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism.30

Key point

The dynamic of racism, whereby individuals
and groups of people are discriminated against
and subjugated on the basis of perceived
physical characteristics such as skin colour,
has been a pervasive and destructive force
in many human societies. Dominant groups
have claimed, either explicitly or implicitly,
superiority over others on the basis of race and
acted upon these claims in discriminatory and
destructive ways. Racism has therefore had a
significant impact on the lives and experiences
of many individuals and groups around the
world. This means that a critical understanding
of culture and cultural difference must include
recognising and understanding both the nature
of racism and its consequences.

that they are unexamined – to those who benefit from
them”.34 This video by Sacha Norrie highlights some of
the aspects of privilege that can remain invisible.

“Invisible Privilege” by Sacha Norrie

SKI N COLOUR
Skin colour is one of the more disturbing, largely
unexamined, and persistent social constructs that
perpetuates discrimination and divides power.
As Indigenous scholar Aileen Moreton-Robinson points
out “whiteness as a racial identity … confers dominance
and privilege [that] remains unmarked and unnamed”.35
For Moreton-Robinson, the category of race subsumes
all other sources of social division, including gender.36
Indeed, in most Western societies, whiteness is a default
standard against which all other groups of colour are
compared, contrasted and made visible.33
Click here to watch the video:
Black and white

To address or minimise the effects of racism, all forms
of hidden racism need to be made visible, including the
intersecting and largely invisible structural forces that
confer power and privilege to dominant groups. That is,
those who have access to resources and power beyond
the common advantages of marginalised citizens.31, 32, 33
However, “most privilege is not recognised as such”.31
In fact, “one of the functions of privilege is to structure
the world so that privileges are invisible – in the sense

Whiteness would not be so problematic if it were not
predicated on white supremacy, imposed overtly and
covertly on racialised minorities, and made invisible
to those who benefit from its existence.33 Whiteness “is
both personal and political”.36 In white majority nations
such as Australia the universality of whiteness allows it
to mask its privileged position. It has thus been argued
that white privilege should be the object of inquiry in
understanding race relations.37

‘...most of the time, I forget what skin colour
I hold and the skin colour of others. The only
time I am reminded is when someone asks me,
“Where are you from?” My mind, always thinks
of the funny reply, “I come from my mother’s
womb”!, but I never say this. Then it hits me like
a brick, I am perceived as being “other”. Socially,
in my younger days, on reflection, I see that
I tried so hard to fit in, and was swept along in
the current of the dominant river. These days,
I am reminded, of the Eurocentric world I live
in, when I put the television on and when I walk
into a shopping centre.’ - Dhammika Pererira-Marland

For those of us who come from a privileged racial
background, unpacking what it means to be white can
prove a challenging and confronting task. US research
found that the question ‘What does it mean to be white?’
was very challenging for white Euro-Americans – the
question simply did not make sense. Interviewing in
downtown San Francisco, researchers found that the most
common response to this question was to ask if it was a
trick. Incredulity was usually followed by a declaration
that this was not something they ever think about.36
Effective change lies in making whiteness visible, by
exploring it as a racial or cultural construct, and defining
whiteness in a non-defensive and non-racist manner.
In order to do this:
White society must be willing to look at themselves
honestly, to confront the truth about themselves and the
world, and to liberate themselves from the invisible cultural
conditioning of a racialised society.33

Part of confronting this truth is to engage with the
broader context in which your international experience
is taking place by learning about the relationship
between local actions and global issues.38, 39 Teju Cole
has highlighted that the international endeavours of
white society to ‘help’ others, known as the White Saviour
Industrial Complex can be “a big emotional experience
that validates privilege” while lacking attention to
the contextual conditions that create poverty and
inequality.40 This speech by Ivan Illich in 1968 elaborates
this point further and provides some confronting
perspectives on the idea of helping or notions of white
superiority, particularly when matched with ignorance
of the broader political, social and economic
relationships between countries.

Engaging with issues of racism and privilege
can be very challenging – both intellectually
and personally. This is, however, an important
challenge if our goal is to develop an inclusive and
critical understanding of culture. In Module 1 we
were encouraged to recognise that culture was
multidimensional and complex and to reject simplistic
definitions and reductionist ways of thinking about
it. Any such complex understanding of culture must
consider the impact of racism because of the pervasive
impact that this dynamic has had on individuals, groups
and indeed societies around the globe. A critically
reflective approach to such an understanding will
involve thinking about these issues not just as abstract
concepts but also as they manifest in our own lives.
For some this may mean reflecting on the experience
of racism themselves, while for others it will involve
recognising and understanding the often-invisible
experience of privilege.

A class divided – Jane Elliott

For those of us who come from privileged racial
backgrounds, one means by which we can begin to
unpack what it means to be white is to understand
ourselves as racial beings. This requires us to learn from
the experiences of those who do not share the same
racial privilege.
What does it mean to be white?

For some ideas about what it means to be white, read
this list by Peggy McIntosh on the daily effects of white
privilege.
Write a brief response, using the following questions as
a guide:
Q1 Have you ever been denied access to educational
opportunities because of the colour of your skin?
Q2 Have you ever been denied access to social and
economic opportunities because of the colour of
your skin?
Q3 Have you ever felt discouraged from considering
certain career paths because of the colour of your
skin?

In the 1970s, primary school teacher Jane Elliott devised
an exercise for her pupils with the aim of learning about
racism and discrimination. The exercise is known as
Blue Eyes-Brown Eyes. This recording shows Ms Elliott
conducting the exercise with her students, and then later
a similar exercise with adults.

You can’t really know the ‘self’ fully until you have
engaged in critical reflection.41

The previous unit suggested that an understanding
of racism and privilege required going beyond
abstract, conceptual knowledge about these issues.
A critical understanding involves reflection on our own
situations and experiences, connecting these to the
broader concepts and dynamics under consideration.
This is also true for our broader goal of intercultural
learning. Intercultural awareness “is not about a passive
absorption of cultural knowledge” which one then applies
in intercultural interactions; rather, it requires ongoing
self-examination and critical reflection about key aspects
of one’s cultural self.42 A critically reflective framework
helps to make explicit the ways in which culture shapes
our values, beliefs, and worldviews. We’ll explore this
further in this module.

One of the key writers on critical reflection, Jan Fook defines critical
reflection as:
… a transformative process based upon a theoretical framework whereby
one engages in a process of understanding how power and domination come
into practice. This process includes an analysis of structural factors such as
class, ‘race’, and gender. It includes also an analysis of cultural factors, such
as beliefs and behaviours. These insights are then reflexively linked to one’s
understanding based upon their experiences.41

The importance of critical reflection in intercultural interactions cannot
be over-stated. Without a reflective awareness of our own cultural selves,
we risk reproducing the very dynamics that have been discussed in this
eBook so far – cultural reductionism, imperialism and racism. Cultural
awareness involves not simply knowing something of the nature of
culture, or learning about the culture of others, it involves developing a
deep and critical awareness of our own cultural selves and our position
in relation to issues such as cultural imperialism and racism. Central to
the process of excavating the elements that make up our cultural self is
the development of a critically reflective framework. Learning to navigate
cultural differences with openness, awareness and respect requires
explicit acknowledgement of one’s cultural self, by “making the ‘invisible’
visible”43 or exploring those aspects that are not known to our self or
others.

not known to others

Through your participation in the reflective exercises of the previous
units you have already begun to explore your capacity to critically reflect
upon key aspects of your culture, and cultural self. The aim of this unit is
to consolidate that learning. In so doing, we examine (or for many of you,
re-examine) the concept of critical reflection. In particular, we explore its
usefulness as a conceptual and theoretical tool that helps make explicit
aspects of one’s cultural self.

Reflection on

The first aspect is to identify the topic, feelings or events
that will form the focus for your reflection. This may
be a critical incident that has occurred that disrupted
or made you re-think your professional assumptions.
Alternatively, you may be encountering a mismatch
between the theory you have been learning during your
course and the application of that theory in practice.
These differences can particularly arise in resourcepoor settings. The first aspect therefore is to identify the
topic or event that will form the subject of your critical
reflection.
Reflecting with

Reflection can occur in formal or informal settings. You
may choose to integrate reflection as part of your daily
life through conversations or journaling, or through more
formal group experiences with your peers, teaching
staff or community members. In practice, a mix of these
options can be beneficial. Individual reflection can have
the advantage of time, space and privacy of thoughts;
however, learning about the reactions of others to a
similar experience can often assist with unearthing our
own cultural assumptions.

Reflective processes require honesty and can create
a degree of discomfort. Group reflective exercises
in particular require a safe space for everyone to
share thoughts, ideas and experiences without fear of
judgement. This requires all participants to respect
confidentiality and to maintain attitudes of curiosity
without judgement, removing competition and
communicating with respect. The same attitudes can
be applied in individual self-reflection; this is not a
time to be overly critical, but rather to adopt an open
attitude of learning about self. The skills that assist with
creating safe environments include active and reflective
listening, reserving judgement, seeking to understand
other points of view, believing that others are acting
with good intent, being aware of power and practising
humility.
Active listening can be hampered by bad habits such as

mind-wandering, multi-tasking or thinking ahead.50

gained in the module thus far:
Interculturality is an ongoing discovery, a perpetual
wondering, the recognition that the ‘other’ is not a void to
be filled but a plenitude to be discovered. When we start
to think we have developed intercultural competencies,
it is very likely that we have in fact started to close
ourselves off from what is actually going on….6

As noted in the second module on imperialism
and cultural diversity, professional practice in the
international domain must “not become an exercise in
cultural imperialism”.15 These arguments have been
made across a range of disciplines, including social
work, medicine, physiotherapy, nursing, occupational
therapy, education, psychology and anthropology.* The
process of repositioning international work requires a
certain criticality about the assumptions underpinning
the Western knowledge base upon which the profession
has been built.16, 51, 52 It is important to avoid reinforcing
notions of the superiority of Western models of practice
that so often prove inappropriate in many non-Western
cultures and to be able to recognise that professional
practice will take alternative forms in different contexts,
due to different worldviews, culture and socio-economic
environments.36, 53, 54
This is not a simple matter of determining that all
knowledge from the West is ‘bad’ and all indigenous
or Eastern knowledge is ‘good’ but rather it is about
awareness of your own cultural lens and openness to
alternative ways of knowing, seeing and being in the
world.55 Perhaps you could aim to become an observer of
your own profession and appreciate that Western models
of practice offer “but a single lens through which to view
the world”.50 Cultivating awareness of your own Western
assumptions takes practice and even practitioners with
substantial international experience must continually
work at questioning their assumptions, as culture is an
embedded and taken for granted part of our daily lives.56

Our earlier module on reflective practice offers one means of
becoming more aware of your own cultural bias, and reflection is an
important ongoing practice in many professions. Other strategies
include cultivating an attitude of “curiosity ahead of judgement” and
recognising one’s own intercultural incompetence.57 This attitude
comes from the practice of cultural relativism, where

This requires practitioners to cultivate the skills to suspend
judgement, tolerate ambiguity, understand that there will be
multiple truths and have a critical awareness of how and by whom
knowledge is created.44 Further to this, it is important to “consider
every culture a dynamic culture and every interaction a dynamic
interaction… as a collaborative partnership based on powersharing”.29 These sentiments are echoed in the concept of cultural
humility which requires “a change in overall perspective and way
of life…[to] be aware of power imbalances and being humble in
every interaction with every individual” by exercising the attributes
of openness, self-awareness, egoless, supportive interaction and
self-reflection and critique.47

For students embarking on an international experience,
it is common to feel a desire to contribute or make
a difference for their host community. However, it
is important to recognise that on arrival in a new
environment, there will be differences to encounter
and much to learn. It can be helpful to think through
the following four stages prior to being able to make a
contribution that your host community would consider
worthwhile. Four stages that students should consider
during an international experience are: recognising,
encountering, adapting and mastering.59 That is you
should first seek to recognise your cultural self;
develop awareness of cultural bias and any ethnocentric
tendencies; encounter by going, doing, seeing and
observing; and adapt by adjusting to or negotiating
new behaviour required in different environments.
Finally, mastering is not intended as an expectation
that you will master intercultural skills, but rather
master the confidence to navigate yourself in your new
environment. These stages are highlighted here to
remind you to question your intentions or expectations
around your international experience and that it will take
time to adjust and adapt to new environments.
While these preparation modules will cultivate your
openness to new experiences and develop your critical
lens, it is also important to recognise that you can never
be fully prepared for an international experience and
that experiences frequently do not match expectations.60,
61, 62
Take care to balance any perceived need to complete

something meaningful or to contribute to your host
community, and instead check in with hosts about their
interests and priorities.63 Experiences of culture shock
are common for students, and practical concerns such
as a fear of not making friends, language barriers or
worries from home can impact on your ability to engage
in higher level intercultural learning.64 It can be helpful
to view every interaction as an intercultural learning
opportunity. These students offer some advice on dealing
with some of the practical concerns of embarking on an
international experience.

As this module highlights, effective intercultural
practice is complex and requires awareness of your
attitudes, values, knowledge and skills. The issues
that have been discussed in this intercultural learning
eBook represent some of the foundational knowledge
and essential approaches that are required for such
effective practice. Engaging with this material should,
however, be considered a starting point in developing
cultural awareness rather than the achievement of such
a goal. Intercultural learning should be considered
a lifelong learning exercise, and one that requires
an ongoing commitment to grappling with these
challenging concepts, being open to new ideas and
experiences, and engaging in critical reflection about
our own cultural selves.

Samantha Webhi asserts that unpacking motivations
for participating in an intercultural exchange can assist
with identifying any pre-conceived ethnocentric or
colonising tendencies. For example, a fascination with
other cultures may indicate a tendency to voyeurism
and imperialism; ‘liking’ people from another country
could mask assumptions of homogeneity; a perception
that it is easier to ‘make a difference’ in an international
rather than a local setting needs to be challenged; and
the desire to ‘give back’ may indicate a lack of awareness
of power relations and the potential for reinforcing
oppression.65
Read this article by Samantha Webhi, that deconstructs
student motivations for undertaking an international
experience and reflect on your own motivations.
Note down your expectations and learning goals for
your international experience. Also note down some
of your fears or concerns and what strategies might
help to manage these? What assumptions might be
underpinning your motivations, fears and expectations?

Narayan Gopalkrishan encourages us to ‘treat every
interaction we have with people from a new culture as an
opportunity to learn’. How might the use of your critically
reflective framework assist in ensuring you learn from
the richness of your intercultural encounters?

Recognising that intercultural-cultural learning is a
life-long endeavour, it is important to consolidate your
learning from your international experience and link this
directly to aspects of your professional practice.
Review the professional standards for your discipline.
Q1 How does your professional body define
intercultural practice?
Q2 Which skills, attitudes or values are required in your
professional practice?
Q3 Which aspects of these modules resonate with
you most, such that you would like to continue to
incorporate them into your professional practice?

Write yourself a letter to address these questions and
ask a close relative or friend to post this to you shortly
after your return from your international experience.
At this point, the letter will be a reminder to revisit your

Looking Forward

Intercultural learning is a lifelong process. The content
you have covered in these modules is complex,
challenging and at times, confronting. As you are now
aware, the idea of becoming culturally competent
represents an over-simplified understanding of
intercultural learning. These modules are the starting
point in developing your critical lens through which you
can examine, reflect and extract deeper learning from
your intercultural experiences. Maintaining a critical
perspective that is informed by an awareness of your
cultural self takes practice. We encourage you to keep
working on the development of your critical lens, expect
to make mistakes and reflect on your experiences.
You will be able to apply these skills not only to your
upcoming intercultural experience, but also throughout
your personal and professional working life. Good luck
and safe journey.

Acculturation: 1) The degree to which
an individual accepts and adheres to the
majority dominant cultural values and their
own cultural values.66 2) The process of
adoption of culture between individuals or
groups. Acculturation can be voluntary where
agreement to adopt another’s culture is
mutual, or forced when one compels another
to accept and participate in their culture.16
Active listening is a communication
technique. To listen actively means to fully
concentrate on what is being said rather
than just passively hear the message of
the speaker. It is engagement throughout
the whole interview in a neutral and nonjudgmental way. Listening and responding
go hand in hand. Someone’s listening can be
distracted by other things around, by
multi-tasking, or by thinking about other
things at the same time, which then influence
what has been remembered and actually
understood.67
Alienation: The feeling or reality of exclusion,
non-belonging and separateness.16
Colonialism: Refers to the event of an alien
people invading the territory inhabited by
people of a different race and culture, to
establish political, social, spiritual, intellectual
and economic domination over that territory
and people. It includes territorial and resource
appropriation by the coloniser and loss of

sovereignty by the colonised. The term also
refers to a set of beliefs used to legitimate
or promote this system, especially the belief
that the mores of the coloniser are superior to
those of the colonised.16

issues, ideologies, beliefs and religions, and
race and ethnicities. It can refer also to work
acknowledging other diverse identities,
such as sexual, political, professional and
organisational.70

Critical consciousness: The ability to perceive
social, political and economic oppression
and to take action against the oppressive
elements of society.68

Cultural awareness: An understanding of
a relevant cultural issue, not necessarily
accompanied by a common or accepted
practice or action.66

Critical reflection: 1) A transformative process
based upon a theoretical framework whereby
one engages in a process of understanding
how power and domination come into
practice. Critical reflection is inclusive of
both a structural analysis (such as class,
gender, race etc), and cultural factors (such
as values, beliefs, and behaviours)69; 2) An
approach to analysing practice or experience,
based on the identification of the assumptions
embedded in that practice or experience. Part
of the difficulty in being able to pin down the
idea of critical reflection with any certainty
possibly arises because critical reflection
itself seems to derive from a number of
different intellectual traditions. The main
traditions from which critical reflection arises
are: 1) reflective practice; 2) reflexivity; 3)
postmodernism and deconstruction; and 4)
critical social theory49.

Cultural competence: 1) The ability to
successfully form, foster and improve
relationships with members of a culture
different from one’s own. It aims to avoid
cultural blindness or the assumption that all
people are the same. At the same time, it is
important not to fall into the trap of believing
that there are so many differences that we
cannot understand or relate to other people
at all. Cross-cultural competence is based on
a commitment to actively seek information
about different ways of doing things and
applying and incorporating this information
in practice. It is based on an understanding
of the values, perceptions, social structure,
norms mores, and verbal and non-verbal
communication strategies of other cultures.7
2) Is the process by which individuals and
systems respond respectfully and effectively
to people of all cultures, languages, classes,
races, ethnic backgrounds, religions, and other
diversity factors in a manner that recognises,
affirms, and values the worth of individuals,

Cross-cultural practice: Practice where there
is a diversity of traditions and intergenerational

families, and communities and protects and
preserves the dignity of each.71
Cultural diversity: is above all, a fact: there
exists a wide range of distinct cultures,
even if the contours delimiting a particular
culture prove more difficult to establish than
might at first sight appear. It is related to the
dynamic process whereby cultures change
while remaining themselves, in a state of
permanent openness to one another. At the
individual level, this is reflected in multiple
and changing cultural identities, which are not
easily reducible to definite categories.6
Cultural genocide: Cultural genocide is
a term used to describe the deliberate
destruction of the cultural heritage of
a people or nation for political, military,
religious, ideological, ethnical, or racial
reasons. Cultural genocide is the purposeful
weakening and ultimate destruction of
cultural values and practices. The United
Nations discusses of genocide as violence
committed “with intent to destroy, in whole
or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or
religious group”. Many scholars consider
this approach too narrow approach as it
fails to acknowledge the full impacts of
cultural destruction.79
Cultural imperialism: Refers to the cultural
aspects of imperialism (see Imperialism
below). Cultural Imperialism encompasses a

range of broadly similar phenomena, and as
such, it is difficult to define, but in its broadest
sense, cultural imperialism refers to the
process whereby imperialist control is aided
and abetted by importing supportive forms of
culture.14
Cultural ‘self’: Cultural awareness involves
not simply knowing something of the nature
of culture, or learning about the culture of
others, it involves developing a deep and
critical awareness of our own cultural selves
and our position in relation to issues such as
cultural imperialism and racism. Central to the
process of excavating the elements that make
up our cultural self is the development of a
critically reflective framework.41
Culture: Is a system of beliefs, values and
customs that are learned, shared, and
transmitted through symbols.66 Cultures
continually evolve through internal processes
and in contact with the environment and other
cultures. Culture is the very substratum of all
human activities, which derive their meaning
and value from it.6 Cultures are not monolithic
structures that exert definable influences over
people’s values, beliefs and behaviours. Often
influences are subtle, go unrecognised or exist
as a composite of cultural and spiritual values
drawn from a variety of sources.42 Culture is
an abstract concept that refers to learned and
shared patterns of perceiving and adapting to
the world.4

Culture shock: The stress, anxiety or
discomfort a person feels when they are placed
in an unfamiliar cultural environment, due to
the loss of familiar meanings and cues relating
to communication and behaviour.66
Emic and etic approaches: an emic
approach, or from within, entails collaborative
processes where both outsiders and insiders
are changed by cultural interactions. An etic
approach is top-down, an outsider point of
view and understanding.8, 72
Ethnicity: A sense of group identification with
beliefs, values and customs that are learned,
shared and transmitted through symbols.66
While ‘race’, ethnicity and nation are often
used interchangeably, they are discrete.
‘Race’ tends to focus on physical attributes
or phenotypes such as skin colour, ethnicity
or origins associated with a specific cultural
group, and nation with nationality within a
nation-state.23
Ethnocentrism: A basic attitude expressing
the belief that one’s own ethnic group or one’s
own culture is superior to other ethnic groups
or cultures, and that one’s cultural standards
can be applied in a universal manner.73
Ethnosphere: A term coined by anthropologist
Wade Davis to refer to the sum total of all
thoughts, dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations,
and intuitions brought into being by the
human imagination since the dawn of

consciousness. The ethnosphere is humanity’s
great legacy. It is a symbol of all that we are,
and all that we can be.10
Eurocentricism: The view that many
Europeans and their descendants have of
themselves as being culturally and politically
superior to all other peoples in the world.16
Globalisation is the ongoing process that is
linking people, neighbourhoods, cities, regions
and countries much more closely together
than they have ever been before. This has
resulted in our lives being intertwined with
people in all parts of the world via the rapid
distribution of the food we eat, the clothing we
wear, the music we listen to, the information
we get and the ideas we hold.75
Hegemony is leadership or dominance of one
state or social group over another. Nowadays
it is also used to describe the relatively
dominant position of a particular set of ideas
and their associated tendency to become
common sense.76
Imperialism: 1) A total system of foreign
power in which another culture, people, and
way of life penetrate, transform and come
to define the colonised society16; 2) A policy
of extending a country’s power or influence
through colonisation, military force, economic
control, or other means. The term ‘imperialism’
should not be confused with ‘colonialism’
as it often is. Imperialism operates from the

centre, it is a state policy, and is developed
for ideological as well as financial reasons,
whereas colonialism is nothing more than
development for settlement or commercial
intentions.13
Institutionalised racism: The ways in which
racist beliefs or values have been built into the
operations of social institutions in such a way
to discriminate against, control and oppress
various minority groups.66
Multiculturalism emphasises the need to
respect and be sensitive to the cultures of
different groups.66
Race is a highly contentious term that has
shifted considerably over time. Scientifically,
all human beings belong to the same race,
yet historically the meaning of the term race
has varied. It once focussed on a racialised
hierarchy that encompassed the physical
attributes of all ‘races’ – identified by skin
colour and depicted in popular parlance as
white, yellow, red and black. Definitions of
‘race’ racialised skin colour. Later, it focussed
on allegedly different intelligence levels that
favoured the white ‘race’. ‘Race’ as a biological
entity has acquired a new lease of life through
genetic biology and socio-biology. These
explain variations in human physicality and
behaviour through genomes. Importantly, it
is ‘the politicisation of this biologically based
process and through the negative evaluation
of darker skin that results in racism, whilst

further exposing its socially constructed
basis’.23 Given what we know about the
capacity of humans to achieve and function
within any culture, present-day inequalities
between so-called ‘racial’ groups are not
consequences of their biological inheritance
but products of historical and contemporary
social, economic, educational, and political
circumstances.77
Racism: A set of economic, political and
ideological practices whereby a dominant
group exercises hegemony over subordinate
groups.26 The United Nations’ International
Convention on the Elimination of all forms
of Racial Discrimination24 defines racial
discrimination as any distinction, exclusion,
restriction or preference based on race,
colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin
which has the purpose or effect of nullifying
or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or
exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights
and fundamental freedoms in the political,
economic, social, cultural or any other field
of public life. Racism has three inter-related,
interactive components that are embedded
in and negotiated through the minutiae of
everyday life: personal; institutional and
cultural.23
Western refers to a way of thinking, a history
of philosophy rooted in ‘rational’ thought
where the individual subject is highly valued;
where secular humanism prevails and
the rational, autonomous, freely choosing

individual is highly valued; where democracy
and freedom of choice is seen as the most just
system promoting human rights and social
justice – fairness and equality of opportunity;
where neoliberal economics tend to dominate
the social terrain and free market economics
and free trade are seen as priorities; where
the dominant history is that of exploration
and conquest, of voyages of discovery in the
interests of progress and the development of
Western civilisations; and where social life is
highly bureaucratised, impersonal and largely
individualistic.16
White privilege is institutional rather than
personal set of benefits for those who are, by
race, having ‘white skin’. Thus whiteness is a
racial identity and in most Western societies
it is a default standard against which all other
groups of colour are compared, contrasted
and made visible.35
Worldview is a way of seeing and
understanding the world. It is a philosophy
of life. It is a mental framework of ideas and
attitudes about the world we live in, people
around us, existing beliefs and ultimately
ourselves in relation to it all. One’s worldview
is shaped by socio-economical, cultural,
historical and contemporary happenings.
One also acts accordingly to one’s values and
worldview.78

assumptions have you noticed in your original description and where
might they have come from? What does your description reveal about
your values, beliefs or awareness of power? What does this tell you about
