In 1998, when I started to work on my PhD dissertation at Cambridge
University on the capability approach and gender inequality, there were
very few scholars working on the capability approach. I recall searching
on the internet for publications on the topic, not receiving more than a
few hundred hits (rather than the, roughly, 440,000 hits one gets today).
I had studied economics and additional courses in social and political
sciences and gender studies, and I had a strong intuition that, for the
study of gender inequalities, the capability approach was a much more
suitable framework than the prevailing ways in which economists as
well as political theorists analysed unjustified gender inequalities. I was
extremely lucky that Amartya Sen had agreed to supervise my doctoral
studies. He not only opened a world that was new for me (being the first
in my family to study for a PhD and the first to study abroad), but also
taught me not to be afraid of developing myself as an interdisciplinary
scholar. And, importantly, he very patiently helped me to grasp the
capability approach in all its details. The privilege of having Amartya
Sen as my PhD supervisor meant that I had the best possible access to
the scholar who had developed the capability approach as it emerged
at the end of the twentieth century. When I graduated from Cambridge
University, I asked Amartya whether he was planning to write another
book on the capability approach, such as his classic Commodities and
Capabilities. He smiled, shook his head and responded: “No, it has grown
over my head”. His judgement was probably very accurate — in essence
the problem of a literature becoming unwieldy — and that challenge
only became much worse over the next two decades. One way to read
this book is to see it as an attempt to tame the proliferation of scholarship
about the capability approach since the turn of the last century.

4

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Over the last fifteen years, I have published quite a number of articles,
book chapters and online pieces on the capability approach, including
many that had as their main aim to clarify or explain certain aspects of
it. But I kept receiving many emails from students who had questions
about the capability approach. Their emails, as well as conversations
with scholars sceptical of the importance of this approach, made it
clear that a general introduction was necessary to answer as many of
these questions as possible. I decided to write an introductory overview
of the capability approach, in which the aim was not to develop my
own, novel version of a capability theory, but rather to try to present
a general helicopter view of the approach. In addition, I felt that too
many claims about or critiques of the capability approach that were
circulating were based either on some scholar’s own interest in seeing
the approach develop exclusively in a certain direction, or else were
based on misunderstandings, often due to miscommunication between
different disciplines.
The result lies in front of you. Unfortunately, it took me much
longer to write this than I had originally planned; almost twelve
years lie between the initial idea and its completion. Yet in hindsight,
despite that at many points the ambition of writing this book felt like
a heavy psychological burden, I have no regrets that I’m only now
completing it. Only in the last year, after the publication of an article
in the Journal of Human Development and Capabilities in which I offered
a general definition of the capability approach (Robeyns 2016b), did it
became clear to me exactly what the general anatomy of the approach
looked like. Thanks to discussions with students and other scholars,
the generalisation of the capability approach that emerged from that
journal article was further crystallised and polished. That generalisation
is the heart of this book, and it is presented in chapter 2. In addition, I
also provide what one could see as an F.A.Q. guide to the capability
literature — the most frequently voiced questions and criticisms will be
clarified and discussed in chapters 3 and 4.
Over the many years of developing my own understanding of the
capability approach, I have learnt a lot from other scholars as well as
from those whom I taught. Intellectually, my biggest debt is no doubt
to Amartya Sen, who had the single most important influence on my
intellectual development. I also learnt a lot from conversations on

capability approach to hundreds of students, but in particular during a
week-long course at the University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, in
2011; during a workshop at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo in March
2016; during a Masterclass at the London School of Economics in which
I worked on a draft of this book manuscript in February 2017; and
during a Research Master’s tutorial in practical philosophy at Utrecht
University during the academic year 2016–2017.
I benefited from the comments I received at two book manuscript
workshops that were held over the last year, one at the Erasmus
University Rotterdam organised by Constanze Binder and Sem de
Maagt, and the other as a session at the 2017 Human Devolpment &
Capability Association (HDCA) conference in Cape Town, organised
by Morten Fibieger Byskov and Rebecca Gutwald. I benefited from the
comments I received at those occasions from Morten Fibieger Byskov,
Willem van der Deijl, Monique Deveaux, Akshath Jitendranath, Caroline
Suransky and Miriam Teschl in Rotterdam, and from Solava Ibrahim,
Serene Khader and Henry Richardson in Cape Town. In addition, I
also received comments on parts of the draft manuscript from Conrad
Heilmann, Chris Lyon, Bart Mijland, Raphael Ng, Petra van der Kooij,
Roland Pierik and Polly Vizard. I owe special thanks to Constanze
Binder, Séverine Deneulin, Morten Fibieger Byskov, Matthias Kramm,
Sem de Maagt and Henry Richardson, whose comments led to multiple
substantive changes. Thanks also to the two anonymous reviewers who

reviewed the book proposal in 2011 and especially to Tania Burchardt,
who reviewed the final manuscript and provided very valuable
suggestions for final revisions.
My thanks are also due to Robert van der Veen, for his permission
to draw on our joint work in section 3.8. I would furthermore like
to acknowledge generous research funding from the Netherlands
Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), who awarded me three
grants over the last 15 years that allowed me to further develop my
research on the capability approach: a four-year postdoctoral scholarship
(2002–2006) to work on the capability approach and theories of justice;
a VIDI grant (2006–2011) to work on demographic changes and social
justice using the capability approach as one of the normative tools;
and finally the Horizon grant (2011–2016) awarded to a consortium
of scholars from three universities and led by Marcus Düwell, for an
interdisciplinary analysis of practical self-understanding. Thanks also
to the team at Open Book Publishers — in particular Lucy Barnes,
Bianca Gualandi, Alice Meyer, and Alessandra Tosi — who have been a
real pleasure to work with.
This book is dedicated to my family — to my husband Roland Pierik
and our children Aaron and Ischa. This book contains not only almost
half a million characters typed and retyped by me, but also visible and
less visible contributions from my three (little) men. Obviously, as a
fellow political philosopher with interdisciplinary leanings, there are
insights from Roland in various places in this book, including some
direct citations. Moreover, Roland helped me not to let the best be the
enemy of the good, and kept encouraging me to finish this book. If I
waited until I was happy with each sentence and paragraph, this book
probably would never see the light of day. Ischa’s contribution may be
the least visible, yet it is there. It is his unconventional view of human
affairs that keeps prompting me not to accept norms or practices that
are unjust or make no sense. Aaron provided the artwork for the cover.
The woven piece very well represents the multi-dimensional nature
of the capability approach, as well as the fact that life is made up by
one’s own choice of functionings, which follows a dynamic and always
unfinished pattern. If one has enough bright and colourful functionings,
they can be woven together to become something bigger than the mere
functionings taken separately — a flourishing life worth living.

1. Introduction

1.1 Why the capability approach?
Many people who encounter the capability approach for the first time
find the ideas embedded within it intuitively attractive. The basic claim
of the capability approach is that, when asking normative questions,
we should ask what people are able to do and what lives they are able
to lead. That claim resonates with widespread ideas among citizens,
academics, and politicians about how to make policies, views about
what social justice requires, or bottom-up views about development and
social progress. Perhaps the most important contribution the capability
approach makes is to prompt us to ask alternative questions, and to
focus on different dimensions when we make observations or when we
gather the relevant data for making evaluations or judgements.
What is the capability approach? This book will answer that question
in detail. But let us start with a first, preliminary description, taken from
a quote by Amartya Sen, who introduced the theoretical idea of the
capability approach in his 1979 Tanner Lecture (Sen 1980a) and soon
after in empirical work (Sen and Sengupta 1983; Sen 1985a). According
to Sen, the capability approach “is an intellectual discipline that gives a
central role to the evaluation of a person’s achievements and freedoms
in terms of his or her actual ability to do the different things a person
has reason to value doing or being” (Sen 2009a, 16). As we will see later
in this book, I will propose a definition and an account of the capability
approach that does not exactly equal Sen’s but rather can be interpreted

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

as a generalisation of Sen’s definition.1 Yet Sen’s definition is a good way
to start, since it highlights that the capability approach is concerned
with aspects of people’s lives such as their health, the education they
can enjoy and the support they enjoy from their social networks; it is
also concerned with what people can do, such as being able to work,
raise a family, travel, or be politically active. The capability approach
cares about people’s real freedoms to do these things, and the level of
wellbeing that they will reach when choosing from the options open to
them. It is a rich, multidimensional approach.
Here’s an example illustrating the difference the capability approach
makes. Everyone agrees that poverty needs to be combatted — but
who are the people that suffer from poverty? Which conceptual and
normative framework do we use when we identify the poor? Which
definition of poverty do we use when we analyse the incidence of
poverty in a country? As empirical research has shown, it does matter
whether one uses the widespread income-based metric, or whether
one takes a capability perspective and focuses on a set of thresholds of
basic functionings, the lack of which indicates a dimension of poverty.
Caterina Ruggeri Laderchi (1997) used data from a Chilean household
survey to investigate the extent to which an income-based measure is
able to capture some basic functionings that could arguably be seen as
central to poverty analysis: basic education, health and nutrition. She
found that the income variable in itself is insignificant as a determinant
of the shortfall in health, schooling and child nutrition and that the role
that income plays is highly non-linear and depends on a number of
other personal, household and regional characteristics. In other words,
looking at the income level in a household to determine whether the
members of that household are poor may be an unreliable indicator for
the prevalence of poverty. The difference between, on the one hand,
the income-based measurements and, on the other hand, measurements
based on a selection of basic indicators that reflect how people are
doing has also been confirmed by a large number of other studies in
the last twenty-five years.2 It is for that income-based approach that the
1	The exact definition and description of the capability approach that I will develop
in this book is broader than Sen’s own. The reason, as will become clear in due
course, is that the “having reason to value” clause in Sen’s definition is, in my view,
a special case of the general definition of the capability approach.

capability approach offers an alternative — but, as will be explained in
this book, it is also an alternative to many other approaches and theories,
such as the happiness approach or resources-based theories of justice.
While the capability approach has been used to identify the poor,
it has also been used for many other purposes. Over the last twentyfive years, the range of fields in which the capability approach has been
applied and developed has expanded dramatically, and now includes
global public health, development ethics, environmental protection
and ecological sustainability, education, technological design, welfare
state policies and many, many more.3 Nor has the use of the capability
approach been restricted to empirical research only. Some of its purposes
have been theoretical, such as the construction of theories of justice
(Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2000; Nussbaum 2006b; Claassen 2016), or
the development of a riches-line, which allows us to identify the rich
(Robeyns 2017b). Other uses of the capability approach have combined
theoretical and empirical research, such as Jonathan Wolff and Avner
De-Shalit’s (2007) study of disadvantage.
For all these endeavours, the capability approach asks: What are
people really able to do and what kind of person are they able to be? It asks
what people can do and be (their capabilities) and what they are
actually achieving in terms of beings and doings (their functionings).
Do the envisioned institutions, practices and policies focus on people’s
capabilities, that is, their opportunities to do what they value and be the
kind of person they want to be? Do people have the same capabilities in
life?4 Or do global economic structures, domestic policies or brute bad
luck make people’s capabilities unequal, and if so, is that unfair and
should we do something about that? Do development projects focus on
3	See section 1.4 for a more detailed discussion of the scope of the capability approach,
and some references to the various fields in which it is now applied and developed.
4	
Some capability scholars, in particular Martha Nussbaum, have extended the
capability approach to include the functionings of non-human animals. In this
book, I restrict the discussion to human functionings and human capabilities. This
is not to deny that the functionings of non-human animals are important, nor
that for some ethical questions we need to consider both humans and non-human
animals. There is a literature that analyses whether the capability approach can
plausibly be extended to include non-human animals, which will not be discussed
here, given the focus on humans (e.g. Nussbaum 2006b; Schinkel 2008; Cripps 2010;
Wissenburg 2011; Holland and Linch 2016). Note that there is also a large literature
on ‘the capabilities of firms’, which is not related to how the term ‘capabilities’ is
used in the capability approach. In this book, the term ‘capabilities’ refers only to
the capabilities of members of the human species.

10

expanding people’s capabilities, or do they have another public policy
goal (such as economic growth), or are they merely serving the interests
of a dominant group? The capability approach thus offers a different
perspective than alternative approaches that focus on the accumulation
of material resources, or the mental states of people, such as their overall
satisfaction with their lives.

1.2 The worries of the sceptics
Although the capability approach appeals to many readers, others have
wondered whether this theory is really any different from other more
established theories, or whether the capability approach is promising as
a theory with sufficient bite. For example John Rawls (1999, 13), while
acknowledging that the idea of basic capabilities is important, calls it “an
unworkable idea” for a liberal conception of justice. John Roemer (1996,
191–93) has criticized the capability approach for being insufficiently
specified — a complaint that is also echoed in the critique made by
Pratab Bhanu Mehta (2009). Others have questioned the practical
significance of the capability approach for policy making and empirical
assessment. For instance, Robert Sugden (1993, 1953) has questioned
the usefulness of the capability approach for welfare economics — a
critique to which we will return in section 4.10. In addition, at seminars
and other scholarly gatherings, an often-heard criticism is that the
capability approach is old wine in new bottles — it aims to do what the
non-economic social sciences have been doing all along. If that is the
case, then why should we bother?5
There are two types of answer to the sceptics. The first is conceptual
or theoretical and that answer will be given in the remainder of this
book. In a nutshell, the reason the capability approach is worth our time
and attention is that it gives us a new way of evaluating the lives of
individuals and the societies in which these people live their lives. The
attention is shifted to public values currently not always considered most
important — such as wellbeing, freedom and justice. It is an alternative
discourse or paradigm, perhaps even a ‘counter-theory’ to a range
of more mainstream discourses on society, poverty and prosperity.
5	Several more specific critiques on the capability approach will be discussed in
chapter 4.

1. Introduction

11

Moreover, it brings insights from several disciplines together, and gives
scholars a common interdisciplinary language. Nevertheless, it doesn’t
follow that the capability approach will always offer a framework that
is to be preferred over other frameworks: as this book will show, the
capability approach can contribute something, but we should be careful
not to overplay our hand and believe that it can do a better job for all
ethical questions.
The second answer to the sceptic is empirical — to show the sceptic
what difference the capability approach makes. The earlier mentioned
study by Ruggeri Laderchi (1997) and dozens of similar studies do
exactly that. In 2006, I provided a survey of the studies in which the
capability approach had been put into practice (Robeyns 2006b) — a task
that I think is no longer feasible today in a single paper or chapter, given
that the empirical literature of applications of the capability approach
has grown dramatically. But in order to illustrate in somewhat greater
depth this kind of answer to the sceptic, let us focus on one type of
empirical application of the capability approach: namely how we
perceive and evaluate our lives at a macro level, and how we evaluate
the social arrangements in which we live those lives.

1.3 A yardstick for the evaluation of prosperity
and progress
For many decades, the dominant way to measure prosperity and social
progress has been to focus on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or Gross
National Product (GNP) per capita. The more we produce, the more
developed our country has been taken to be. Yet a large literature has
emerged showing that GDP per capita is limited and often flawed as a
measure of social and economic progress (Fleurbaey 2009; Stiglitz, Sen
and Fitoussi 2010; Fleurbaey and Blanchet 2013; Coyle 2015).
In one of the very first empirical applications of the capability
approach, Amartya Sen (1985a) used some very simple statistics to
illustrate how deceiving GDP per capita can be as a measure of prosperity
and progress.6 Sen showed that, in the early 1980s, the (roughly
6	An even earlier empirical study, in which the capability approach is referred to
as the right evaluative framework, was done by Amartya Sen and Sunil Sengupta
(1983).

12

equivalent) GNP per capita of Brazil and Mexico was more than seven
times the (roughly equivalent) GNP per capita of India, China and Sri
Lanka — yet performances in life expectancy, infant mortality and child
death rates were best in Sri Lanka, better in China compared to India
and better in Mexico compared to Brazil. Important social indicators
related to life, premature death and health, can thus not be read from
the average national income statistic. Another finding was that India
performs badly regarding basic education but has considerably higher
tertiary education rates than China and Sri Lanka. Thus, Sen concluded
that the public policy of China and especially Sri Lanka towards
distributing food, public health measures, medical services and school
education have led to their remarkable achievements in the capabilities
of survival and education. What can this application teach us about
the capability approach? First, the ranking of countries based on GNP
per capita can be quite different from a ranking based on the selected
functionings. Second, growth in GNP per capita should not be equated
with growth in living standards.
Sen has often made use of the power of comparing the differences
in the ranking of countries based on GDP per capita with indicators
of some essential functionings. Recently Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen
(2013, 46–50) used the capability approach to develop an analysis of
India’s development policies. For example, as table 1.1 shows, they
compared India with the fifteen other poorest countries outside subSaharan Africa in terms of development indicators.7
Of those sixteen countries, India ranks on top in terms of GDP
per capita, but ranks very low for a range of functionings, such as life
expectancy at birth, infant mortality, undernourishment, schooling
and literacy. Other countries, with fewer financial means, were able to
achieve better outcomes in terms of those functionings. Once again, the
point is made that focussing on income-based metrics such as disposable
income at the household level, or GDP per capita at the national level,
gives limited information on the lives people can lead.

Those other countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, Haiti,
Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Moldova, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Yemen.

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

This type of illustration of the power of the capability approach, whereby
at the macro level the quality of life in a country is compared with GDP
per capita, is not restricted to poor countries only. For example, the
capability approach has recently also been taken up by the ‘Better Life
Initiative’ of the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. The aim of this initiative is to track wellbeing, both
in the present day and historically, by looking at ten dimensions of
wellbeing: per capita GDP, real wages, educational attainment, life
expectancy, height, personal security, the quality of political institutions,
environmental quality, income inequality and gender inequality.
Several of these dimensions can be conceptualized through a capability
lens and others (such as per capita GDP or real wages) are needed for
a comparison between capability dimensions and income dimensions,
or can be seen as core capability determinants or capability inputs. In a
recent report, which reconstructed the outcomes on those dimensions
between 1820 and 2000, it was found that some dimensions, such as
education and health outcomes, are strongly correlated with per capita
GDP, but others are not — such as the quality of political institutions,
homicide rates and exposure to conflicts (Van Zanden et al. 2014).
Another example that illustrates the difference the capability
approach can make is the analysis of gender inequality, for which it
is clear that we are missing out the most important dimensions if we
only focus on how income is distributed. There are two main problems
with an income-based approach to gender inequalities. The first is that
it is often assumed that income within households will be shared. Yet
that assumption makes most of the economic inequalities between
women and men invisible (Woolley and Marshall 1994; Phipps and
Burton 1995; Robeyns 2006a). Moreover, gender scholars across the
disciplines have argued that one of the most important dimensions
of gender inequality is the distribution of burdens between men
and women (paid work, household work and care work); the fact
that women are expected to do the lion’s share of unpaid household
work and care work makes them financially vulnerable and restricts
their options. Any account of gender inequality that wants to focus
on what really matters should talk about the gender division of paid
and unpaid work, and the capability approach allows us to do that,
since both paid and unpaid work can be conceptualized as important

capabilities of human beings (e.g. Lewis and Giullari 2005; Robeyns
2003, 2010; Addabbo, Lanzi and Picchio 2010).
Moreover, for millions of girls and women worldwide, the most
important capability that is denied to them is extremely basic — the
capability to live in the first place. As Sen showed in an early study and
as has been repeatedly confirmed since, millions of women are ‘missing’
from the surface of the Earth (and from the population statistics), since
newborn girls have been killed or fatally neglected, or female foetuses
have been aborted, because they were females in a society in which
daughters are more likely to be seen as a burden, especially when
compared to sons (Sen 1990b, 2003b, 1992b; Klasen 1994; Klasen and
Wink 2003). In sum, tracking the gap between women’s achievements
in income and wealth or labour market outcomes will not reveal
some crucial dimensions of gender inequality, whereas the capability
approach draws attention to these non-income-based dimensions.
Using the capability approach when thinking about prosperity
and social progress has another advantage: it will impede policy
makers from using mistaken assumptions about human beings in
their policies, including how we live together and interact in society
and communities, what is valuable in our lives and what kind of
governmental and societal support is needed in order for people (and
in particular the disadvantaged) to flourish. For example, in their study
of disadvantage in affluent societies, in particular the UK and Israel,
Jonathan Wolff and Avner De-Shalit discuss the effects of a government
policy of clearing a slum by moving the inhabitants to newly built tower
blocks. While there may be clear material advantages to this policy — in
particular, improving the hygiene conditions in which people live — a
capabilitarian analysis will point out that this policy damages the social
aspects of people’s wellbeing, since social networks and communities are
broken up and cannot simply be assumed to be rebuilt in the new tower
blocks (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 168, 178–79). Since social relationships
among people are key to their wellbeing, this may well have additional
derivative effects on other dimensions of people’s lives, such as their
mental health. Understanding people as beings whose nature consists
of a plurality of dimensions can help governments to think carefully
through all the relevant effects of their policies.

1.4 Scope and development
of the capability approach
The previous section provides one type of answer to those who are
sceptical about the capability approach, namely by showing what
difference it makes in practice. The other strand in answering the
sceptic who asks “Why bother?” is to explain in detail how one should
understand the capability approach as a conceptual and theoretical
frame and how it differs from other theoretical frameworks. After all, a
proper understanding of what the capability approach precisely is (and
is not) should also help in making clear what difference it can make.
While this book is not framed as a reply to the sceptic, implicitly such
an argument is made in the chapters to come.
Nevertheless, we should not simply assume that the added value
of the capability approach is equal across cases, fields and disciplines.
In some areas, the difference between the capability approach and the
dominant ways of thinking and evaluating are so significant that we can
rightly speak of a ‘counter-theory’. In other debates and discussions, the
difference that the capability approach makes to the prevailing modes
of analysis has been more limited. Moreover, the development of the
capability approach itself is uneven within different disciplines.
In some debates, the capability approach has been so much
studied, developed or applied that we should no longer speak of “the
potential of the capability approach” or “the promises of the capability
approach”, since the work that has been done has made quite clear what
difference the capability approach actually makes. The prime example
is the literature and debate on the very idea of what development is.
The capability approach has made a crucial foundational contribution
to the growth of the human development paradigm which is now wellknown, especially through the work of the Human Development Reports,
which are annually published by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). In addition, the most well-known of Sen’s
books among the wider public is Development as Freedom, which uses
the capability approach as a key element of his alternative vision on
development (Sen 1999a). In economics, Sabina Alkire, James Foster and

1. Introduction



17

their collaborators have made major contributions to the development
of poverty measures based on the capability approach, with the
development of the Multidimensional Poverty Index (Alkire and
Foster 2011; Alkire et al. 2015). In the area of development studies, the
capability approach is no longer a new and emerging alternative (as it
was twenty to thirty years ago), but rather one of the major established
frameworks.8
Another area is philosophical thinking about the metric of distributive
justice (that is: what we ought to compare between individuals when
we make statements about whether certain inequalities between people
are unjust). In this literature too, the capability approach has by now
established itself as an important alternative.9 And while work on
development and on justice perhaps stands out, there are now significant
bodies of literature on the capability approach in many fields, such
as health economics and public health,10 technology,11 sustainability
analysis and environmental policy studies,12 disability studies,13 and

the vast amount of literature in educational studies that works with the
capability approach.14
However, in other academic fields it is more disputed to what extent
the capability approach has been shown to make a real difference. For
example, in ethical theories within the systematic/analytical strand of
philosophy, the capability approach hasn’t yet been much developed.
Similarly, one can doubt whether the capability approach has
contributed to a significant change in mainstream economic thinking.
The development of the capability approach within different academic
disciplines and discussions thus differs significantly, and the effect the
capability approach has had on developing new policies also differs
drastically between different policy fields.
In the debates where the capability approach is now well-established,
the development of that literature has often raised new questions. For
example, in philosophical theories of justice there are now enough
convincing arguments that the capability approach makes a difference,
but the very possibility of a capability theory of justice has also allowed
us to be much more explicit about which questions remain unaddressed
in case one wants to make a substantive theory of (distributive) justice
(Freeman 2006; Robeyns 2016d). This is a ‘normal’ way in which a
paradigm develops. It therefore shouldn’t be surprising that we have
just as many questions about the capability approach as we had a few
years ago. We may even have more, but they are different to those that
were raised a decade or two ago.
Whatever the unevenness in its uptake and development between
disciplines, and independently of the new questions that the capability
approach has raised, the current state of the literature which I will present
in this book confirms that the capability approach is here to stay. It makes
a difference in many debates. It is one of those rare theories that strongly
connects disciplines and offers a truly interdisciplinary language. And it
leads to recommendations on how to organise society and choose policies
that are often genuine alternatives for prevailing views.

1.5 A guide for the reader
This book has an extremely simple structure. There are five chapters — an
introduction (this chapter), a short concluding chapter (chapter 5) and
three very long chapters in the middle. In chapter 2 we start with a
rather simple explanation of the capability approach, and then present
a more detailed account of capability theories, focusing in particular on
their structure and properties. I will present the capability approach
by describing it as having a modular structure — whereby each specific
capability theory combines the core elements of the non-optional module
with a range of non-core modules. This way of looking at the capability
approach helps those who want to apply the capability approach to a
particular question or problem to see clearly which elements are needed
for such an application; it also makes it very clear that the capability
approach can be specified in diverse ways. One could see chapter 2 as
trying to provide the anatomy of the capability approach — to try to see
behind its skin, to detect what its various organs are, how they interact
and which ones are essential, whereas others may be more tangential.
In chapter 3 we discuss further details and try to clear up some
misunderstandings. The capability approach is a field that is notoriously
prone to misunderstandings, in part because of its interdisciplinary
nature, but also because the terminology differs somewhat between
different authors. Chapter 3 tries to present the literature as neutrally as
possible and describes how it has been evolving.
Chapter 4 then zooms in on a range of critiques that have been
made of the capability approach, such as the argument that it is too
individualistic, or that it cannot properly account for power. In this
chapter, my own voice will be more prominent, as I will engage with
these claims, agreeing with some of them (and, as philosophers do,
giving reasons why I agree), but also arguing against some other critiques.
Here, it will become clear what the value is of the distinction between the
general capability approach and more specific capability theories, which
I introduced elsewhere (Robeyns 2016b) and explain again in section
2.3. As it turns out, some of the critiques are valid against particular
capability theories, but make no sense against the capability approach in
general. I hope that the adoption of this distinction between capability
theories or applications on the one hand, and capability approach on

20

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

the other, will clear the capability literature of many confusing and
unnecessary criticisms, so that we can devote our energy to those that
are powerful and with which we need to engage. Moreover, let us not
forget that the capability approach is a tool and not an end in itself; we
should master it as well as we can, perhaps also as efficiently as we can,
and then move on to use it in the work that really matters.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework

2.1 Introduction
The previous chapter listed a range of fields in which the capability
approach has been taken up, and in chapters 3 and 4 we focus in more
detail on how the capability approach can (or cannot) make a difference
for thinking about wellbeing, social and distributive justice, human
rights, welfare economics and other topics. This broad uptake of the
capability approach across disciplines and across different types of
knowledge production (from theoretical and abstract to applied or
policy oriented) is testimony to its success. But how is the capability
approach understood in these different fields, and is it possible to
give a coherent and clarifying account of how we can understand the
capability approach across those fields?1 In other words, how should we
understand the capability approach as an overarching framework, that
unites its more specific uses in different fields and disciplines?
1	In developing the account of the capability approach as presented in this book, I
have started in an inductive way by trying to generalize from how the capability
approach has been used in the literature. However, that literature has been critically
scrutinized, and in some cases I have come to the conclusion that some ideas in
this broad ‘capabilities literature’ do not survive careful analysis, and should be
rejected. Put differently, my methodology has been to be as inclusive as possible,
but not at the cost of endorsing (what I believe to be) confusions or errors.

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

This chapter gives an account of that general framework. It provides
explanations and insights into what the capability approach is, what its
core claims are, and what additional claims we should pay attention to.
This chapter will also answer the question: what do we mean exactly
when we say that the capability approach is a framework or an approach?
In other words, in this chapter, I will give an account (or a
description) of the capability approach at the most general level. I will
bracket additional details and questions about which disagreement or
confusion exists; chapter 3 will offer more detailed clarifications and
chapter 4 will discuss issues of debate and dispute. Taken together, these
three chapters provide my understanding of the capability approach.
Chapter 2 is structured as follows. In the next section, we look at a
preliminary definition of the capability approach. Section 2.3 proposes
to make a distinction between ‘the capability approach’ and ‘a capability
theory’. This distinction is crucial — it will help us to clarify various
issues that we will look at in this book, and it also provides some answers
to the sceptics of the capability approach whom we encountered in the
previous chapter. Section 2.4 describes, from a bottom-up perspective,
the many ways in which the capability approach has been developed
within particular theories, and argues why it is important to acknowledge
the great diversity within capabilitarian scholarship. Sections 2.5 to 2.11
present an analytic account of the capability approach, and show what is
needed to develop a particular capability theory, application or analysis.
In 2.5, I propose the modular view of the capability approach, which
allows us to distinguish between three different types of modules that
make up a capability theory. The first, the A-module, consists of those
properties that each capability theory must have (section 2.6). This is the
non-optional core of each capability theory. The B-modules are a set of
modules in which the module itself is non-optional, but there are different
possible choices regarding the content of the module (section 2.7). For
example, we cannot have a capability theory or application without
having chosen a purpose for that theory or application — yet there are
many different purposes among which we can choose. The third group
of modules, the C-modules, are either non-optional but dependent on
a choice made in the B-modules, or else are completely optional. For
example, if the purpose you choose is to measure poverty, then you
need to decide on some empirical methods in the C-modules; but if your

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



23

aim is to make a theory of justice, you don’t need to choose empirical
methods and hence the C-module for empirical methods (module C3)
is not relevant for your capability application (section 2.8).2 In the next
section, 2.9, I discuss the possibility of hybrid theories — theories that
give a central role to functionings and capabilities yet violate some
other core proposition(s). Section 2.11 rounds up the discussion of the
modular view by discussing the relevance and advantages of seeing the
capability approach from this perspective.
Section 2.12 summarises the conceptual aspects that have been
explained by presenting a visualisation of the conceptual framework of
the capability approach. Section 2.13 uses the modular view to illuminate
the observation, which has been made by several capability scholars,
that the capability approach has been used in a narrow and in a broad
sense, and explains what difference lies behind this distinction. In the
broader use of the capability approach, supporting or complementary
theories or additional normative principles are added to the core of the
approach — yet none of them is itself essential to the capability approach.
These are choices made in B-modules or the C-modules. The modular
view of the capability approach that will be central to this chapter can
thus help to formulate in a sharper manner some observations that have
already been made in the capability literature. The chapter closes by
looking ahead to the next chapter.

2.2 A preliminary definition
of the capability approach
The capability approach has in recent decades emerged as a new
theoretical framework about wellbeing, freedom to achieve wellbeing,
and all the public values in which either of these can play a role, such
as development and social justice. Although there is some scholarly
disagreement on the best description of the capability approach (which
will be addressed in this chapter), it is generally understood as a

capability approach here unclear: please bear with me until we have reached the
end of this chapter, when the different modules will have been unpacked and

conceptual framework for a range of evaluative exercises, including
most prominently the following: (1) the assessment of individual levels
of achieved wellbeing and wellbeing freedom; (2) the evaluation and
assessment of social arrangements or institutions;3 and (3) the design of
policies and other forms of social change in society.
We can trace some aspects of the capability approach back to,
among others, Aristotle, Adam Smith, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill,4
yet it is Sen who pioneered the approach and a growing number of
other scholars across the humanities and the social sciences who have
significantly developed it — most significantly Martha Nussbaum, who
has developed the capability approach into a partial theory of social
justice.5 Nussbaum also understands her own capabilities account as a
version of a theory of human rights.6 The capability approach purports
that freedom to achieve wellbeing is a matter of what people are able to
do and to be, and thus the kind of life they are effectively able to lead. The
capability approach is generally conceived as a flexible and multipurpose
framework, rather than a precise theory (Sen 1992a, 48; Alkire 2005;
Robeyns 2005b, 2016b; Qizilbash 2012; Hick and Burchardt 2016, 78).
The open-ended and underspecified nature of the capability approach is
crucial, but it has not made it easier for its students to understand what
kind of theoretical endeavour the capability approach exactly is. How
should we understand it? Isn’t there a better account possible than the
3	Amartya Sen often uses the term “social arrangement”, which is widely used in the
social choice literature and in some other parts of the literature on the capability
approach. Yet this term is not very widely used in other disciplines, and many
have wondered what “social arrangement” exactly means (e.g. Béteille 1993). Other
scholars tend to use the term “institutions”, using a broad definition — understood
as the formal and informal rules in society that structure, facilitate and delineate
actions and interactions. “Institutions” are thus not merely laws and formal rules
such as those related to the system of property rights or the social security system,
but also informal rules and social norms, such as social norms that expect women
to be responsible for raising the children and caring for the ill and elderly, or forbid
members of different castes to work together or interact on an equal footing.
4	See Nussbaum (1988, 1992), Sen (1993a, 1999a, 14, 24); Walsh (2000); Qizilbash
(2016); Basu and López-Calva (2011, 156–59).
5	A partial theory of justice is a theory that gives us an account of some aspects
of what justice requires, but does not comment on what justice requires in other
instances or areas.

somewhat limited description of the capability approach as ‘an open,
flexible and multi-purpose framework’? Answering these questions will
be the task of this chapter.7
The open and underspecified nature of the capability approach also
explains why the term ‘capability approach’ was adopted and is now
widely used rather than ‘capability theory’. Yet as I will argue in section
2.3, we could use the terms ‘capability theory’ and ‘capability approach’
in a more illuminating way to signify a more substantive difference,
which will help us to get a better grip on the capability literature.
It may be helpful to introduce the term ‘advantage’ here, which is a
technical term used in academic debates about interpersonal comparisons
and in debates about distributive justice.8 A person’s advantage is
those aspects of that person’s interests that matter (generally, or in a
specific context). Hence ‘advantage’ could refer to a person’s achieved
wellbeing, or it could refer to her opportunity to achieve wellbeing, or
it could refer to her negative freedoms, or to her positive freedoms, or
to some other aspect of her interests. By using the very general term
‘advantage’, we allow ourselves to remain agnostic between the more
particular specifications of that term;9 our analysis will apply to all
the different ways in which ‘advantage’ could be used. This technical
term ‘advantage’ thus allows us to move the arguments to a higher
level of generality or abstraction, since we can focus, for example, on
which conditions interpersonal comparisons of advantage need to meet,
without having to decide on the exact content of ‘advantage’.

7	
For earlier attempts to describe the capability approach, see amongst others
Deneulin (2014); Gasper (2007, 1997); Alkire, Qizilbash and Comim (2008); Qizilbash
(2012); Robeyns (2005b, 2016b).
8	A ‘technical term’ is a term which is used in a specialist debate, and has a meaning
that is defined within that debate. In many cases, the term refers to something other
than its referent in common-sense language (that is, a layperson’s use of language).
9	To ‘remain agnostic’ means that, for the purpose of that analysis, one does not
make a choice between different options, and hence proceeds with an analysis that
should be valid for all those options. This does not mean that one cannot make a
choice, or really believes that all available options are equally good, but rather that
one wants to present an analysis that is applicable to as wide a range of choices as
possible.

26

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Within the capability approach, there are two different specifications
of ‘advantage’: achieved wellbeing, and the freedom to achieve
wellbeing. The notions of ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’ — which will
be explained in detail in section 2.6.1 — are used to flesh out the account
of achieved wellbeing and the freedom to achieve wellbeing.10 Whether
the capability approach is used to analyse distributive injustice, or
measure poverty, or develop curriculum design — in all these projects
the capability approach prioritises certain people’s beings and doings
and their opportunities to realize those beings and doings (such as their
genuine opportunities to be educated, their ability to move around or
to enjoy supportive social relationships). This stands in contrast to other
accounts of advantage, which focus exclusively on mental categories
(such as happiness) or on the material means to wellbeing (such as
resources like income or wealth).11
Thus, the capability approach is a conceptual framework, which is
in most cases used as a normative framework for the evaluation and
assessment of individual wellbeing and that of institutions, in addition
to its much more infrequent use for non-normative purposes.12 It can
be used to evaluate a range of values that draw on an assessment of
people’s wellbeing, such as inequality, poverty, changes in the wellbeing
of persons or the average wellbeing of the members of a group. It can
also be used as an evaluative tool providing an alternative for social
cost-benefit analysis, or as a framework within which to design and
10	Following Amartya Sen (1985c), some would say there are four different ideas
of advantage in the capability approach: achieved wellbeing, freedom to achieve
wellbeing, achieved agency, and freedom to achieve agency. Yet whether the
capability approach should always and for all purposes consider agency freedom
to be an end in itself is disputed, and depends in large measure on what one wants
to use the capability approach for.
11	Of course, it doesn’t follow that mental categories or the material means play
no role at all; but the normative priority lies with functionings and capabilities,
and hence happiness or material resources play a more limited role (and, in the
case of resources, a purely instrumental role). The relations between functionings/
capabilities and resources will be elaborated in 3.12; the relationship between
functionings/capabilities and happiness will be elaborated in more detail in
section 3.8.

evaluate policies and institutions, such as welfare state design in
affluent societies, or poverty reduction strategies by governments and
non-governmental organisations in developing countries.
What does it mean, exactly, if we say that something is a normative
analysis? Unfortunately, social scientists and philosophers use these
terms slightly differently. My estimate is that, given their numerical
dominance, the terminology that social scientists use is dominant
within the capability literature. Yet the terminology of philosophers is
more refined and hence I will start by explaining the philosophers’ use
of those terms, and then lay out how social scientists use them.
What might a rough typology of research in this area look like?
By drawing on some discussions on methods in ethics and political
philosophy (O. O’Neill 2009; List and Valentini 2016), I would like
to propose the following typology for use within the capability
literature. There are (at least) five types of research that are relevant
for the capability approach. The first type of scholarship is conceptual
research, which conducts conceptual analysis — the investigation of
how we should use and understand certain concepts such as ‘freedom’,
‘democracy’, ‘wellbeing’, and so forth. An example of such conceptual
analysis is provided in section 3.3, where I offer a (relatively simple)
conceptual analysis of the question of what kind of freedoms (if any)
capabilities could be. The second strand of research is descriptive. Here,
research and analyses provide us with an empirical understanding
of a phenomenon by describing it. This could be done with different
methods, from the thick descriptions provided by ethnographic methods
to the quantitative methods that are widely used in mainstream social
sciences. The third type of research is explanatory analysis. This research
provides an explanation of a phenomenon — what the mechanisms are
that cause a phenomenon, or what the determinants of a phenomenon
are. For example, the social determinants of health: the parameters
or factors that determine the distribution of health outcomes over
the population. A fourth type of research is evaluative, and consists of
analyses in which values are used to evaluate a state of affairs. A claim is
evaluative if it relies on evaluative terms, such as good or bad, better or
worse, or desirable or undesirable. Finally, an analysis is normative if it is

28

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

prescriptive — it entails a moral norm that tells us what we ought to do.13
Evaluative analyses and prescriptive analyses are closely intertwined,
and often we first conduct an evaluative analysis, which is followed by
a prescriptive analysis, e.g. by policy recommendations, as is done, for
example, in the evaluative analysis of India’s development conducted
by Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen (2013). However, one could also make
an evaluative analysis while leaving the prescriptive analysis for
someone else to make, perhaps leaving it to the agents who need to
make the change themselves. For example, one can use the capability
approach to make an evaluation or assessment of inequalities between
men and women, without drawing prescriptive conclusions (Robeyns
2003, 2006a). Or one can make a prescriptive analysis that is not based
on an evaluation, because it is based on universal moral rules. Examples
are the capability theories of justice by Nussbaum (2000; 2006b) and
Claassen (2016).
The difference with the dominant terminology used by economists
(and other social scientists) is that they only distinguish between two
types of analysis: ‘positive’ versus ‘normative’ economics, whereby
‘positive’ economics is seen as relying only on ‘facts’, whereas ‘normative
economics’ also relies on values (e.g. Reiss 2013, 3). Hence economists
do not distinguish between what philosophers call ‘evaluative analysis’
and ‘normative analysis’ but rather lump them both together under
the heading ‘normative analysis’. The main take-home message is that
the capability approach is used predominantly in the field of ethical
analysis (philosophers’ terminology) or normative analysis (economists’
terminology), somewhat less often in the fields of descriptive analysis
and conceptual analysis, and least in the field of explanatory analysis.
We will revisit this in section 3.10, where we address whether the
capability approach can be an explanatory theory.

13	Alkire (2008) calls these normative applications “prospective analysis”, and argues
that we need to distinguish the evaluative applications of the capability approach
from the “prospective applications” of the capability approach. I agree, but since we
should avoid introducing new terms when the terms needed are already available,
it would be better to use the term ‘prescriptive applications’ or, as philosophers do,
‘normative analysis’, rather than introducing ‘prospective applications’ as a new
term.

2.3 The capability approach
versus capability theories
The above preliminary definition highlights that the capability
approach is an open-ended and underspecified framework, which
can be used for multiple purposes. It is open-ended because the general
capability approach can be developed in a range of different directions,
with different purposes, and it is underspecified because additional
specifications are needed before the capability approach can become
effective for a particular purpose — especially if we want it to be
normative (whether evaluative or prescriptive). As a consequence, ‘the
capability approach’ itself is an open, general idea, but there are many
different ways to ‘close’ or ‘specify’ this notion. What is needed for this
specifying or closing of the capability approach will depend on the
aim of using the approach, e.g. whether we want to develop it into a
(partial) theory of justice, or use it to assess inequality, or conceptualise
development, or use it for some other purpose.
This distinction between the general, open, underspecified capability
approach, and its particular use for specific purposes is absolutely
crucial if we want to understand it properly. In order to highlight that
distinction, but also to make it easier for us to be clear when we are
talking about the general, open, underspecified capability approach,
and when we are talking about a particular use for specific purposes,
I propose that we use two different terms (Robeyns 2016b, 398). Let us
use the term ‘the capability approach’ for the general, open, underspecified
approach, and let us employ the term ‘a capability theory’ or ‘a capability
analysis, capability account or capability application’ for a specific use of
the capability approach, that is, for a use that has a specific goal, such
as measuring poverty and deriving some policy prescriptions, or
developing a capabilitarian cost-benefit analysis, or theorising about
human rights, or developing a theory of social justice. In order to
improve readability, I will speak in what follows of ‘a capability theory’
as a short-hand for ‘a capability account, or capability application, or
capability theory’.14
14	I kindly request readers who are primarily interested in the capability approach
for policy design and (empirical) applications to read ‘capability application’ every
time the term ‘capability theory’ is used.

30

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

One reason why this distinction between ‘capability approach’ and
‘capability theory’ is so important, is that many theories with which the
capability approach has been compared over time are specific theories,
not general open frameworks. For example, John Rawls’s famous
theory of justice is not a general approach but rather a specific theory
of institutional justice (Rawls 2009), and this has made the comparison
with the capability approach at best difficult (Robeyns 2008b). The
appropriate comparison would be Rawls’s theory of justice with a
properly developed capability theory of justice, such as Nussbaum’s
Frontiers of Justice (Nussbaum 2006b), but not Rawls’s theory of justice
with the (general) capability approach.
Another reason why the distinction between ‘capability approach’
and ‘capability theory’ is important, is that it can help provide an
answer to the “number of authors [who] ‘complain’ that the capability
approach does not address questions they put to it” (Alkire 2005, 123).
That complaint is misguided, since the capability approach cannot, by
its very nature, answer all the questions that should instead be put to
particular capability theories. For example, it is a mistake to criticise
Amartya Sen because he has not drawn up a specific list of relevant
functionings in his capability approach; that critique would only have
bite if Sen were to develop a particular capability theory or capability
application where the selection of functionings is a requirement.15
In short, there is one capability approach and there are many
capability theories, and keeping that distinction sharply in mind should
clear up many misunderstandings in the literature.
However, if we accept the distinction between capability theories
and the capability approach, it raises the question of what these
different capability theories have in common. Before addressing that
issue, I first want to present a bottom-up description of the many
modes in which capability analyses have been conducted. This will
give us a better sense of what the capability approach has been used
for, and what it can do for us.
15	Yet even for capability theories, it is unlikely that Sen would agree that he has to
draw up a list of capabilities, since he is a proponent of a procedural method for
selecting capabilities. At the beginning of this century, there was a fierce discussion
in the capability literature about whether it was a valid critique of Sen’s work that
it lacked a specific list (Nussbaum 2003a; Robeyns 2003; Sen 2004a; Qizilbash 2005).
Luckily that debate seems to be settled now. For an overview of the different ways
in which dimensions can be selected in the capability approach, see section 2.7.2.

2.4 The many modes of capability analysis
If the capability approach is an open framework, then what are the ways
in which it has been closed to form more specific and powerful analyses?
Scholars use the capability approach for different types of analysis,
with different goals, relying on different methodologies, with different
corresponding roles for functionings and capabilities. Not all of these
are capability theories; some are capability applications, both empirical
as well as theoretical. We can observe that there is a rich diversity of
ways in which the capability approach has been used. Table 2.1 gives
an overview of these different usages, by listing the different types of
capability analyses.
Normative theorising within the capability approach is often done
by moral and political philosophers. The capability approach is then
used as one element of a normative theory, such as a theory of justice
or a theory of disadvantage. For example, Elizabeth Anderson (1999)
has proposed the outlines of a theory of social justice (which she calls
“democratic equality”) in which certain basic levels of capabilities that
are needed to function as equal citizens should be guaranteed to all.
Martha Nussbaum (2006b) has developed a minimal theory of social
justice in which she defends a list of basic capabilities that everyone
should be entitled to, as a matter of human dignity.
While most normative theorising within the capability approach
has related to justice, other values have also been developed and
analysed using the capability approach. Some theorists of freedom
have developed accounts of freedom or rights using the capability
approach (van Hees 2013). Another important value that has been
studied from the perspective of the capability approach is ecological
sustainability (e.g. Anand and Sen 1994, 2000; Robeyns and Van der
Veen 2007; Lessmann and Rauschmayer 2013; Crabtree 2013; Sen
2013). Efficiency is a value about which very limited conceptual
work is done, but which nevertheless is inescapably normative, and
it can be theorised in many different ways (Le Grand 1990; Heath
2006). If we ask what efficiency is, we could answer by referring to
Pareto optimality or x-efficiency, but we could also develop a notion
of efficiency from a capability perspective (Sen 1993b). Such a notion
would answer the question ‘efficiency of what?’ with ‘efficiency in the
space of capabilities (or functionings, or a mixture)’.

Quantitative social scientists, especially economists, are mostly
interested in measurement. This quantitative work could serve
different purposes, e.g. the measurement of multidimensional
poverty analysis (Alkire and Foster 2011; Alkire et al. 2015), or the
measurement of the disadvantages faced by disabled people (Kuklys
2005; Zaidi and Burchardt 2005). Moreover, some quantitative social
scientists, mathematicians, and econometricians have been working
on investigating the methods that could be used for quantitative
capability analyses (Kuklys 2005; Di Tommaso 2007; Krishnakumar
2007; Krishnakumar and Ballon 2008; Krishnakumar and Nagar 2008).
Thick description or descriptive analysis is another mode of
capability analysis. For example, it can be used to describe the realities
of schoolgirls in countries that may have formal access to school for both
girls and boys, but where other hurdles (such as high risk of rape on the
way to school, or the lack of sanitary provisions at school) mean that this
formal right is not enough to guarantee these girls the corresponding
capability (Unterhalter 2003b).
Finally, the capability approach can be used for conceptual work
beyond the conceptualisation of values, as is done within normative
philosophy. Sometimes the capability approach lends itself well to
providing a better understanding of a certain phenomenon. For example,
we could understand education as a legal right or as an investment in
human capital, but we could also conceptualise it as the expansion of a
capability, or develop an account of education that draws on both the
capability approach and human rights theory. This would not only help
us to look differently at what education is; a different conceptualisation
would also have normative implications, for example related to the
curriculum design, or to answer the question of what is needed to
ensure that capability, or of how much education should be guaranteed
to children with low potential market-related human capital (McCowan
2011; Nussbaum 2012; Robeyns 2006c; Walker 2012a; Walker and
Unterhalter 2007; Wigley and Akkoyunlu-Wigley 2006).
Of course, texts and research projects often have multiple goals, and
therefore particular studies often mix these different goals and methods.
Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen’s (1996, 2002, 2013) comprehensive
analyses of India’s human development achievements are in part an
evaluative analysis based on various social indicators, but also in part

34

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

a prescriptive analysis. Similarly, Nussbaum’s (2000) book Women and
Human Development is primarily normative and philosophical, but
also includes thick descriptions of how institutions enable or hamper
people’s capabilities, by focussing on the lives of particular women.
What is the value of distinguishing between different uses of
the capability approach? It is important because functionings and
capabilities — the core concepts in the capability approach — play
different roles in each type of analysis. In quality of life measurement,
the functionings and capabilities are the social indicators that reflect a
person’s quality of life. In thick descriptions and descriptive analysis, the
functionings and capabilities form part of the narrative. This narrative
can aim to reflect the quality of life, but it can also aim to understand
some other aspect of people’s lives, such as by explaining behaviour
that might appear irrational according to traditional economic analysis,
or revealing layers of complexities that a quantitative analysis can rarely
capture. In philosophical reasoning, the functionings and capabilities
play yet another role, as they are often part of the foundations of a
utopian account of a just society or of the goals that morally sound
policies should pursue.
The flexibility of functionings and capabilities, which can be applied
in different ways within different types of capability analysis, means that
there are no hard and fast rules that govern how to select the relevant
capabilities. Each type of analysis, with its particular goals, will require
its own answer to this question. The different roles that functionings
and capabilities can play in different types of capability analyses have
important implications for the question of how to select the relevant
capabilities: each type of analysis, with its particular goals, will require
its own answer to this question. The selection of capabilities as social
indicators of the quality of life is a very different undertaking from
the selection of capabilities for a utopian theory of justice: the quality
standards for research and scholarship are different, the epistemic
constraints of the research are different, the best available practices in
the field are different. Moral philosophers, quantitative social scientists,
and qualitative social scientists have each signed up to a different set
of meta-theoretical assumptions, and find different academic practices

2. Core Ideas and the Framework

acceptable and unacceptable. For example, many ethnographers tend to
reject normative theorising and also often object to what they consider
the reductionist nature of quantitative empirical analysis, whereas many
economists tend to discard the thick descriptions by ethnographers,
claiming they are merely anecdotal and hence not scientific.
Two remarks before closing this section. First, providing a typology
of the work on the capability approach, as this section attempts to do,
remains work in progress. In 2004, I could only discern three main
modes of capability analysis: quality of life analysis; thick description/
descriptive analysis; and normative theories — though I left open the
possibility that the capability approach could be used for other goals
too (Robeyns 2005a). In her book Creating Capabilities, Nussbaum
(2011) writes that the capability approach comes in only two modes:
comparative qualify of life assessment, and as a theory of justice. I don’t
think that is correct: not all modes of capability analysis can be reduced
to these two modes, as I have argued elsewhere in detail (Robeyns 2011,
2016b). The different modes of capability analysis described in table 2.1
provide a more comprehensive overview, but we should not assume
that this overview is complete. It is quite likely that table 2.1 will, in
due course, have to be updated to reflect new types of work that uses
the capability approach. Moreover, one may also prefer another way
to categorise the different types of work done within the capability
literature, and hence other typologies are possible and may be more
illuminating.
Second, it is important that we fully acknowledge the diversity of
disciplines, the diversity of goals we have for the creation of knowledge,
and the diversity of methods used within the capability approach. At
the same time, we need not forget that some aspects of its development
might need to be discipline-specific, or specific for one’s goals. As a
result, the capability approach is at the same time multidisciplinary,
interdisciplinary, but also forms part of developments within disciplines
and methods. These different ‘faces’ of the capability approach all need
to be fully acknowledged if we want to understand it in a nuanced and
complete way.

36

2.5 The modular view of the capability approach
It is time to take stock. What do we already know about the capability
approach, and what questions are raised by the analysis so far?
The capability approach is an open approach, and depending on
its purpose can be developed into a range of capability theories or
capabilitarian applications. It is focused on what people can do and
be (their capabilities) and on what they are actually achieving in terms
of beings and doings (their functionings). However, this still does
not answer the question of what kind of framework the capability
approach is. Can we give an account of a capability theory that is more
enlightening regarding what exactly makes a theory a capabilitarian
theory, and what doesn’t?
In this book, I present an account of the capability approach that,
on the one hand, makes clear what all capability theories share, yet on
the other hand allows us to better understand the many forms that a
capability theory or capability account can take — hence to appreciate
the diversity within the capability approach more fully. The modular
view that I present here is a modified (and, I hope, improved) version
of the cartwheel model that I have developed elsewhere (Robeyns
2016b). The modular view shifts the focus a little bit from the question
of how to understand the capability approach in general, to the
question of how the various capability accounts, applications and
theories should be understood and how they should be constructed.
After all, students, scholars, policy makers and activists are often not
concerned with the capability approach in general, but rather want to
know whether it would be a smart idea to use the capability approach
to construct a particular capability theory, application or account for
the problem or question they are trying to analyse. In order to answer
the question of whether, for their purposes, the capability approach is
a helpful framework to consider, they need to know what is needed
for a capability theory, application or account. The modular view that
will follow will give those who want to develop a capability theory,
application or analysis a list of properties their theory has to meet,
a list of choices that need to be made but in which several options
regarding content are possible, and a list of modules that they could
take into account, but which will not always be necessary.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



37

Recall that in order to improve readability, I use the term ‘a capability
theory’ as a short-hand for ‘a capability account, or capability analysis,
or capability application, or capability theory’. A capability theory is
constructed based on three different types of module, which (in order
to facilitate discussion) will be called the A-module, B-modules and
C-modules. The A-module is a single module which is compulsory
for all capability theories. The A-module consists of a number of
propositions (definitions and claims) which a capability theory should
not violate. This is the core of the capability approach, and hence entails
those properties that all capability theories share. The B-modules consist
of a range of non-optional modules with optional content. That is, if
we construct a capability theory, we have to consider the issue that the
module addresses, but there are several different options to choose from
in considering that particular issue. For example, module B1 concerns the
‘purpose’ of the theory: do we want to make a theory of justice, or a more
comprehensive evaluative framework for societal institutions, or do we
want to measure poverty or inequality, or design a curriculum, or do we
want to use the capability approach to conceptualise ‘social progress’
or ‘efficiency’ or to rethink the role of universities in the twenty-first
century? All these purposes are possible within the capability approach.
The point of seeing these as B-modules is that one has to be clear about
one’s purpose, but there are many different purposes possible. The
C-modules are either contingent on a particular choice made in a
B-module, or they can be fully optional. For example, one can offer a
comprehensive evaluation of a country’s development path, and decide
that as part of this evaluation, one wants to include particular accounts
of the history and culture of that country, since this may make more
comprehensible the reasons why that country has taken this particular
development path rather than another. The particular historical account
that would be part of one’s capability theory would then be optional.16

16	To say that the insertion of those theories is fully optional is not the same as saying
that capability theories that will be developed with different types of additional
complementary theories will all be equally good. For example, historians are very
likely to think that most theories, even normative theories, have to be historically
informed, and hence the relevant historical knowledge will need to be added to
a capability theory. But these are matters of dispute that have to be debated, and
cannot be settled by narrowing down the definition of a capability theory.

38

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Given this three-fold structure of the modular view of capability
theories, let us now investigate what the content of the compulsory
module A is, as well as what the options are within the B-modules and
C-modules.

of all capability theories

2.6.1 A1: Functionings and capabilities
Functionings and capabilities are the core concepts in the capability
approach. They are also the dimensions in which interpersonal
comparisons of ‘advantage’ are made (this is what property A5
entails).17 They are the most important distinctive features of all
capabilitarian theories. There are some differences in the usage of these
notions between different capability theorists,18 but these differences
do not affect the essence of these notions: capabilities are what people
are able to be and to do, and functionings point to the corresponding
achievements.
17	See section 2.2 for an explanation of the technical term ‘advantage’.

Capabilities are real freedoms or real opportunities, which do
not refer to access to resources or opportunities for certain levels of
satisfaction. Examples of ‘beings’ are being well-nourished, being
undernourished, being sheltered and housed in a decent house, being
educated, being illiterate, being part of a supportive social network;
these also include very different beings such as being part of a criminal
network and being depressed. Examples of the ‘doings’ are travelling,
caring for a child, voting in an election, taking part in a debate, taking
drugs, killing animals, eating animals, consuming great amounts of fuel
in order to heat one’s house, and donating money to charity.
Capabilities are a person’s real freedoms or opportunities to achieve
functionings.19 Thus, while travelling is a functioning, the real
opportunity to travel is the corresponding capability. A person who
does not travel may or may not be free and able to travel; the notion
of capability seeks to capture precisely the fact of whether the person
could travel if she wanted to. The distinction between functionings
and capabilities is between the realized and the effectively possible, in
other words, between achievements, on the one hand, and freedoms or
opportunities from which one can choose, on the other.
Functionings are constitutive of human life. At least, this is a
widespread view, certainly in the social sciences, policy studies, and
in a significant part of philosophy — and I think it is a view that is
helpful for the interdisciplinary, practical orientation that the vast
majority of capability research has.20 That means one cannot be a human
being without having at least a range of functionings; they make the
lives of human beings both lives (as opposed to the existence of innate
objects) and human (in contrast to the lives of trees or animals). Human
functionings are those beings and doings that constitute human life and
that are central to our understandings of ourselves as human beings.
It is hard to think of any phenomenological account of the lives of

See also section 3.3 which discusses in more depth the kind of freedoms or
opportunities that capabilities are.
20	The exceptions are those philosophers who want to develop normative theories
while steering away from any metaphysical claims (that is, claims about how things
are when we try to uncover their essential nature). I agree that the description of
‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’ in this section makes metaphysical claims, but I
think they are very ‘minimal’ (in the sense that they are not wildly implausible, and
still leave open a wide variety of theories to be developed) and hence we should not
be troubled by these metaphysical assumptions.

40

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

humans — either an account given by a human being herself, or an
account from a third-person perspective — which does not include a
description of a range of human functionings. Yet, not all beings and
doings are functionings; for example, flying like a bird or living for two
hundred years like an oak tree are not human functionings.
In addition, some human beings or doings may not be constitutive
but rather contingent upon our social institutions; these, arguably,
should not qualify as ‘universal functionings’ — that is, functionings
no matter the social circumstances in which one lives — but are rather
‘context-dependent functionings’, functionings that are to a significant
extent dependent on the existing social structures. For example, ‘owning
a house’ is not a universal functioning, yet ‘being sheltered in a safe way
and protected from the elements’ is a universal functioning. One can also
include the capability of being sheltered in government-funded housing
or by a rental market for family houses, which is regulated in such a
way that it does not endanger important aspects of that capability.
Note that many features of a person could be described either as a
being or as a doing: we can say that a person is housed in a pleasantly
warm dwelling, or that this person does consume lots of energy to keep her
house warm. Yet other functionings are much more straightforwardly
described as either a being or a doing, for example ‘being healthy’ (a
being) or ‘killing animals’ (a doing).
A final remark. Acknowledging that functionings and capabilities
are the core concepts of the capability approach generates some further
conceptual questions, which have not all been sufficiently addressed in
the literature. An important question is whether additional structural
requirements that apply to the relations between various capabilities
should be imposed on the capability approach in general (not merely
as a particular choice for a specific capability theory). Relatively little
work has been done on the question of the conceptual properties
of capabilities understood as freedoms or opportunities and on the
question of the minimum requirements of the opportunity set that
make up these various capabilities. But it is clear that more needs to
be said about which properties we want functionings, capabilities, and
capability sets to meet. One important property has been pointed out
by Kaushik Basu (1987), who argued that the moral relevance lies not in
the various capabilities each taken by themselves and only considering

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



41

the choices made by one person. Rather, the moral relevance lies in
whether capabilities are truly available to us given the choices made by
others, since that is the real freedom to live our lives in various ways,
as it is truly open to us. For example, if a teenager lives in a family in
which there are only enough resources for one of the children to pursue
higher education, then he only truly has the capability to pursue higher
education if none of his older siblings has made that choice before him.21

2.6.2 A2: Functionings and capabilities
are value-neutral categories
Functionings and capabilities are defined in a value-neutral way. Many
functionings are valuable, but not all functionings necessarily have a
positive value. Instead, some functionings have no value or even have
a negative value, e.g. the functioning of being affected by a painful,
debilitating and ultimately incurable illness, suffering from excessive
levels of stress, or engaging in acts of unjustifiable violence. In those
latter cases, we are better off without that functionings outcome,
and the functionings outcome has a negative value. Functionings are
constitutive elements of human life, which consist of both wellbeing
and ill-being. The notion of functionings should, therefore, be valueneutral in the sense that we should conceptually allow for the idea of
‘bad functionings’ or functionings with a negative value (Deneulin and
Stewart 2002, 67; Nussbaum 2003a, 45; Stewart 2005, 190; Carter 2014,
79–81).
There are many beings and doings that have negative value, but they
are still ‘a being’ or ‘a doing’ and, hence, a functioning. Nussbaum made
that point forcefully when she argued that the capability to rape should
not be a capability that we have reason to protect (Nussbaum 2003:
44–45). A country could effectively enable people to rape, for example,
either when rape is not illegal (as it is not between husband and wife in
many countries), or when rape is illegal, but de facto never leads to any
21	Arguably, some of that work is being done by social choice theorists and others
working with axiomatic methods, but unfortunately almost none of the insights
of that work have spread among the disciplines within the capability literature
where axiomatic and other formal methods are not used (and, presumably, not well
understood). See, for example, Pattanaik (2006); Xu (2002); Gotoh, Suzumura and
Yoshihara (2005); Gaertner and Xu (2006, 2008).

42

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

punishment of the aggressor. If there is a set of social norms justifying
rape, and would-be rapists help each other to be able to rape, then
would-be rapists in that country effectively enjoy the capability to rape.
But clearly, rape is a moral bad, and a huge harm to its victims; it is thus
not a capability that a country should want to protect. This example
illustrates that functionings as well as capabilities can be harmful or
have a negative value, as well as be positive or valuable. At an abstract
and general level, ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’ are thus in themselves
neutral concepts, and hence we cannot escape the imperative to decide
which ones we want to support and enable, and which ones we want to
fight or eliminate. Frances Stewart and Séverine Deneulin (2002, 67) put
it as follows:
[…] some capabilities have negative values (e.g. committing murder),
while others may be trivial (riding a one-wheeled bicycle). Hence there is
a need to differentiate between ‘valuable’ and non-valuable capabilities,
and indeed, within the latter, between those that are positive but of lesser
importance and those that actually have negative value.

The above examples show that some functionings can be unequivocally
good (e.g. being in good health) or unequivocally bad (e.g. being
raped or being murdered). In those cases, there will be unanimity on
whether the functionings outcome is bad or good. But now we need to
add a layer of complexity. Sometimes, it will be a matter of doubt, or of
dispute, whether a functioning will be good or bad — or the goodness
or badness may depend on the context and/or the normative theory we
endorse. An interesting example is giving care, or ‘care work’.22 Clearly
being able to care for someone could be considered a valuable capability.
For example, in the case of child care, there is much joy to be gained, and
many parents would like to work less so as to spend more time with
their children. But care work has a very ambiguous character if we try
to answer whether it should be considered to be a valuable functioning
from the perspective of the person who does the care. Lots of care is
performed primarily because there is familial or social pressure put on
someone (generally women) to do so, or because no-one else is doing it
22	On the complex nature of ‘care’, and what the need to care and be cared for requires
from a just society, see e.g. Tronto (1987); Kittay (1999); Nussbaum (2006b); Folbre
(1994); Folbre and Bittman (2004); Engster (2007); Gheaus (2011); Gheaus and
Robeyns (2011).

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



43

(Lewis and Giullari 2005). There is also the hypothesis that care work
can be a positive functioning if done for a limited amount of time, but
becomes a negative functioning if it is done for many hours. Hence, from
the functionings outcome in itself, we cannot conclude whether this is
a positive element of that person’s quality of life, or rather a negative
element; in fact, sometimes it will be an ambiguous situation, which
cannot easily be judged (Robeyns 2003).
One could wonder, though, whether this ambiguity cannot simply
be resolved by reformulating the corresponding capability slightly
differently. In theory, this may be true. If there are no empirical
constraints related to the observations we can make, then one could in
many cases rephrase such functionings that are ambiguously valued into
another capability where its valuation is clearly positive. For example,
one could say that the functioning of providing care in itself can be
ambiguous (since some people do too much, thereby harming their own
longer-term wellbeing, or do it because no-one else is providing the care
and social norms require them to do it). Yet there is a closely related
capability that is clearly valuable: the capability to provide hands-on
care, which takes into account that one has a robust choice not to care if
one does not want to, and that one does not find oneself in a situation in
which the care is of insufficient quantity and/or quality if one does not
deliver the care oneself. If such a robust capability to care is available, it
would be genuinely valuable, since one would have a real option not
to choose the functioning without paying an unacceptable price (e.g.
that the person in need of care is not properly cared for). However,
the problem with this solution, of reformulating functionings that are
ambiguously valuable into capabilities that are unequivocally valuable,
is the constraints it places on empirical information. We may be able to
use these layers of filters and conditions in first-person analyses, or in
ethnographic analyses, but in most cases not in large-scale empirical
analyses.
Many specific capability theories make the mistake of defining
functionings as those beings and doings that one has reason to value.
But the problem with this value-laden definition is that it collapses two
aspects of the development of a capability theory into one: the definition
of the relevant space (e.g. income, or happiness, or functionings) and,
once we have chosen our functionings and capabilities, the normative

44

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

decision regarding which of those capabilities will be the focus of our
theory. We may agree on the first issue and not on the second and still
both rightly believe that we endorse a capability theory — yet this is
only possible if we analytically separate the normative choice for
functionings and capabilities from the additional normative decision
of which functionings we will regard as valuable and which we will
not regard as valuable. Collapsing these two normative moments into
one is not a good idea; instead, we need to acknowledge that there
are two normative moves being made when we use functionings and
capabilities as our evaluative space, and we need to justify each of those
two normative moves separately.
Note that the value-laden definition of functionings and capabilities,
which defines them as always good and valuable, may be less
problematic when one develops a capability theory of severe poverty or
destitution. We all agree that poor health, poor housing, poor sanitation,
poor nutrition and social exclusion are dimensions of destitution. So, for
example, the dimensions chosen for the Multidimensional Poverty Index
developed by Sabina Alkire and her colleagues — health, education and
living standard — may not elicit much disagreement.23 But for many
other capability theories, it is disputed whether a particular functionings
outcome is valuable or not. The entire field of applied ethics is filled with
questions and cases in which these disputes are debated. Is sex work
bad for adult sex workers, or should it be seen as a valuable capability?
Is the capability of parents not to vaccinate their children against polio
or measles a valuable freedom? If employees in highly competitive
organisations are not allowed to read their emails after working hours,
is that then a valuable capability that is taken away from them, or are we
protecting them from becoming workaholics and protecting them from
the pressure to work all the time, including at evenings and weekends?
As these examples show, we need to allow for the conceptual possibility
that there are functionings that are always valuable, never valuable,
valuable or non-valuable in some contexts but not in others, or where

Human Development Initiative (OPHI), under the leadership of Sabina Alkire. See

we simply are not sure. This requires that functionings and capabilities
are conceptualised in a value-neutral way, and hence this should be a
core requirement of the capability approach.

2.6.3 A3: Conversion factors
A third core idea of the capability approach is that persons have different
abilities to convert resources into functionings. These are called conversion
factors: the factors which determine the degree to which a person can
transform a resource into a functioning. This has been an important
idea in Amartya Sen’s version of the capability approach (Sen 1992a,
19–21, 26–30, 37–38) and for those scholars influenced by his writings.
Resources, such as marketable goods and services, but also goods and
services emerging from the non-market economy (including household
production) have certain characteristics that make them of interest to
people. In Sen’s work in welfare economics, the notion of ‘resources’ was
limited to material and/or measurable resources (in particular: money
or consumer goods) but one could also apply the notion of conversion
factors to a broader understanding of resources, including, for example,
the educational degrees that one has.
The example of a bike is often used to illustrate the idea of conversion
factors. We are interested in a bike not primarily because it is an object
made from certain materials with a specific shape and colour, but
because it can take us to places where we want to go, and in a faster way
than if we were walking. These characteristics of a good or commodity
enable or contribute to a functioning. A bike enables the functioning
of mobility, to be able to move oneself freely and more rapidly than
walking. But a person might be able to turn that resource into a valuable
functioning to a different degree than other persons, depending on the
relevant conversion factors. For example, an able-bodied person who
was taught to ride a bicycle when he was a child has a high conversion
factor enabling him to turn the bicycle into the ability to move around
efficiently, whereas a person with a physical impairment or someone
who never learnt to ride a bike has a very low conversion factor. The
conversion factors thus represent how much functioning one can get
out of a resource; in our example, how much mobility the person can
get out of a bicycle.

46

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

There are several different types of conversion factors, and the
conversion factors discussed are often categorized into three groups
(Robeyns 2005b, 99; Crocker and Robeyns 2009, 68). All conversion
factors influence how a person can be or is free to convert the
characteristics of the resources into a functioning, yet the sources of
these factors may differ. Personal conversion factors are internal to the
person, such as metabolism, physical condition, sex, reading skills, or
intelligence. If a person is disabled, or if she is in a bad physical condition,
or has never learned to cycle, then the bike will be of limited help in
enabling the functioning of mobility. Social conversion factors are factors
stemming from the society in which one lives, such as public policies,
social norms, practices that unfairly discriminate, societal hierarchies,
or power relations related to class, gender, race, or caste. Environmental
conversion factors emerge from the physical or built environment in
which a person lives. Among aspects of one’s geographical location are
climate, pollution, the likelihood of earthquakes, and the presence or
absence of seas and oceans. Among aspects of the built environment
are the stability of buildings, roads, and bridges, and the means of
transportation and communication. Take again the example of the
bicycle. How much a bicycle contributes to a person’s mobility depends
on that person’s physical condition (a personal conversion factor), the
social mores including whether women are generally allowed to ride a
bicycle (a social conversion factor), and the availability of decent roads
or bike paths (an environmental conversion factor). Once we start to be
aware of the existence of conversion factors, it becomes clear that they
are a very pervasive phenomenon. For example, a pregnant or lactating
woman needs more of the same food than another woman in order to
be well-nourished. Or people living in delta regions need protection
from flooding if they want to enjoy the same capability of being safely
sheltered as people living in the mountains. There are an infinite number
of other examples illustrating the importance of conversion factors. The
three types of conversion factor all push us to acknowledge that it is
not sufficient to know the resources a person owns or can use in order
to be able to assess the wellbeing that he or she has achieved or could
achieve; rather, we need to know much more about the person and the
circumstances in which he or she is living. Differences in conversion
factors are one important source of human diversity, which is a central

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



47

concern in the capability approach, and will be discussed in more detail
in section 3.5.
Note that many conversion factors are not fixed or given, but can
be altered by policies and choices that we make. And the effects of a
particular conversion factor can also depend on the social and personal
resources that a person has, as well as on the other conversion factors.
For example, having a physical impairment that doesn’t allow one to
walk severely restricts one’s capability to be mobile if one finds oneself
in a situation in which one doesn’t have access to a wheelchair, and in
which the state of the roads is bad and vehicles used for public transport
are not wheelchair-accessible. But suppose now the built environment
is different: all walking-impaired people have a right to a wheelchair,
roads are wheelchair-friendly, public transport is wheelchair-accessible
and society is characterised by a set of social norms whereby people
consider it nothing but self-evident to provide help to fellow travellers
who can’t walk. In such an alternative social state, with a different
set of resources and social and environmental conversion factors, the
same personal conversion factor (not being able to walk) plays out very
differently. In sum, in order to know what people are able to do and be,
we need to analyse the full picture of their resources, and the various
conversion factors, or else analyse the functionings and capabilities
directly. The advantage of having a clear picture of the resources needed,
and the particular conversion factors needed, is that it also gives those
aiming to expand capability sets information on where interventions
can be made.

2.6.4 A4: The means-ends distinction
The fourth core characteristic of the capability approach is the meansends distinction. The approach stresses that we should always be clear,
when valuing something, whether we value it as an end in itself, or as a
means to a valuable end. For the capability approach, when considering
interpersonal comparisons of advantage, the ultimate ends are people’s
valuable capabilities (there could be other ends as well; see 2.6.6). This
implies that the capability approach requires us to evaluate policies and
other changes according to their impact on people’s capabilities as well
as their actual functionings; yet at the same time we need to ask whether

48

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

the preconditions — the means and the enabling circumstances — for
those capabilities are in place. We must ask whether people are able
to be healthy, and whether the means or resources necessary for this
capability, such as clean water, adequate sanitation, access to doctors,
protection from infections and diseases and basic knowledge on health
issues are present. We must ask whether people are well-nourished, and
whether the means or conditions for the realization of this capability,
such as having sufficient food supplies and food entitlements, are
being met. We must ask whether people have access to a high-quality
education system, to real political participation, and to community
activities that support them, that enable them to cope with struggles in
daily life, and that foster caring friendships. Hence we do need to take
the means into account, but we can only do so if we first know what the
ends are.
Many of the arguments that capability theorists have advanced
against alternative normative frameworks can be traced back to the
objection that alternative approaches focus on particular means to
wellbeing rather than the ends.24 There are two important reasons why
the capability approach dictates that we have to start our analysis from
the ends rather than the means. Firstly, people differ in their ability to
convert means into valuable opportunities (capabilities) or outcomes
(functionings) (Sen 1992a, 26–28, 36–38). Since ends are what ultimately
matter when thinking about wellbeing and the quality of life, means can
only work as fully reliable proxies of people’s opportunities to achieve
those ends if all people have the same capacities or powers to convert
those means into equal capability sets. This is an assumption that goes
against a core characteristic of the capability approach, namely claim
A3 — the inter-individual differences in the conversion of resources
into functionings and capabilities. Capability scholars believe that these
inter-individual differences are far-reaching and significant, and hence
this also explains why the idea of conversion factors is a compulsory
option in the capability approach (see 2.6.3). Theories that focus on

24	This is a critique that the capability approach shares with the happiness approach,
which also focusses on what it considers to be an end in itself — happiness. Still,
capability scholars have reasons why they do not endorse the singular focus on
happiness, as the happiness approach proposes. See section 3.8.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



49

means run the risk of downplaying the normative relevance of not only
these conversion factors, but also the differences in structural constraints
that people face (see 2.7.5).
The second reason why the capability approach requires us to start
from ends rather than means is that there are some vitally important
ends that do not depend very much on material means, and hence
would not be picked up in our analysis if we were to focus on means
only. For example, self-respect, supportive relationships in school or in
the workplace, or friendship are all very important ends that people
may want; yet there are no crucial means to those ends that one could
use as a readily measurable proxy. We need to focus on ends directly if
we want to capture what is important.
One could argue, however, that the capability approach does not
focus entirely on ends, but rather on the question of whether a person is
being put in the conditions in which she can pursue her ultimate ends.
For example, being able to read could be seen as a means rather than an
end in itself, since people’s ultimate ends will be more specific, such as
reading street signs, the newspaper, or the Bible or Koran. It is therefore
somewhat more precise to say that the capability approach focuses on
people’s ends in terms of beings and doings expressed in general terms:
being literate, being mobile, being able to hold a decent job. Whether a
particular person then decides to translate these general capabilities into
the more specific capabilities A, B or C (e.g. reading street signs, reading
the newspaper or reading the Bible) is up to them. Whether that person
decides to stay put, travel to the US or rather to China, is in principle
not important for a capability analysis: the question is rather whether
a person has these capabilities in more general terms.25 Another way
of framing this is to say that the end of policy making and institutional
design is to provide people with general capabilities, whereas the ends
of persons are more specific capabilities.26
Of course, the normative focus on ends does not imply that the
capability approach does not at all value means such as material or
25	
However, while a focus on available options rather than realised choices is
the default normative focus of capability theories, there are some capability
applications where, for good reasons, the focus is on achieved functionings rather
than capabilities. This will be elaborated in the next section.
26	On the distinction between general capabilities and specific capabilities, see 3.2.4.

50

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

financial resources. Instead, a capability analysis will typically focus
on resources and other means. For example, in their evaluation of
development in India, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen (2002, 3) have
stressed that working within the capability approach in no way
excludes the integration of an analysis of resources such as food. In
sum, all the means of wellbeing, like the availability of commodities,
legal entitlements to them, other social institutions, and so forth, are
important, but the capability approach presses the point that they are
not the ends of wellbeing, only their means. Food may be abundant in
the village, but a starving person may have nothing to exchange for it,
no legal claim on it, or no way of preventing intestinal parasites from
consuming it before he or she does. In all these cases, at least some
resources will be available, but that person will remain hungry and,
after a while, undernourished.27
Nevertheless, one could wonder: wouldn’t it be better to focus
on means only, rather than making the normative analysis more
complicated and more informationally demanding by also focusing on
functionings and capabilities? Capability scholars would respond that
starting a normative analysis from the ends rather than means has at
least two advantages, in addition to the fundamental reason mentioned
earlier that a focus on ends is needed to appropriately capture interindividual differences.
First, if we start from being explicit about our ends, the valuation
of means will retain the status of an instrumental valuation rather than
risk taking on the nature of a valuation of ends. For example, money or
economic growth will not be valued for their own sake, but only in so far
as they contribute to an expansion of people’s capabilities. For those who
have been working within the capability framework, this has become a
deeply ingrained practice — but one only needs to read the newspapers
for a few days to see how often policies are justified or discussed without
a clear distinction being made between means and ends.
Second, by starting from ends, we do not a priori assume that
there is only one overriding important means to those ends (such as

27	The relationship between means and capabilities is analysed in more depth in
section 3.12.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



51

income), but rather explicitly ask the question: which types of means are
important for the fostering and nurturing of a particular capability, or
set of capabilities? For some capabilities, the most important means will
indeed be financial resources and economic production, but for others it
may be a change in political practices and institutions, such as effective
guarantees and protections of freedom of thought, political participation,
social or cultural practices, social structures, social institutions, public
goods, social norms, and traditions and habits. As a consequence, an
effective capability-enhancing policy may not be increasing disposable
income, but rather fighting a homophobic, ethnophobic, racist or sexist
social climate.

2.6.5 A5: Functionings and capabilities
as the evaluative space
If a capability theory is a normative theory (as is often the case), then
functionings and capabilities form the entire evaluative space, or are
part of the evaluative space.28 A normative theory is a theory that entails
a value judgement: something is better than or worse than something
else. This value judgement can be used to compare the position of
different persons or states of affairs (as in inequality analysis) or it can
be used to judge one course of action as ‘better’ than another course of
action (as in policy design). For all these types of normative theories, we
need normative claims, since concepts alone cannot ground normativity.
The first normative claim which each capability theory should
respect is thus that functionings and capabilities form the ‘evaluative
space’. According to the capability approach, the ends of wellbeing
freedom, justice, and development should be conceptualized in terms
of people’s functionings and/or capabilities. This claim is not contested
28	I am using the term ‘normative’ here in the way it is used by social scientists, hence
encompassing what philosophers call both ‘normative’ and ‘evaluative’. For these
different uses of terminology, see section 2.2. It is also possible to use the notions
of ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’ for non-normative purposes (see section 3.10). In
that case, the basic notions from the core are all that one takes from the capability
approach; one does not need this normative part of the core. I will suggest in the
concluding chapter 5 that explanatory applications of the capability approach are
part of how it could be fruitfully developed in the future.

52

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

among scholars of the capability approach; for example, Sabina Alkire
(2005, 122) described the capability approach as the proposition “that
social arrangements should be evaluated according to the extent of
freedom people have to promote or achieve functionings they value”.
However, if we fully take into account that functionings can be positive
but also negative (see 2.6.2), we should also acknowledge that our lives
are better if they contain fewer of the functionings that are negative,
such as physical violence or stress. Alkire’s proposition should therefore
minimally be extended by adding “and to promote the weakening of
those functionings that have a negative value”.29
However, what is relevant is not only which opportunities are
open to us individually, hence in a piecemeal way, but rather which
combinations or sets of potential functionings are open to us. For example,
suppose you are a low-skilled poor single parent who lives in a society
without decent social provisions. Take the following functionings: (1)
to hold a job, which will require you to spend many hours on working
and commuting, but will generate the income needed to properly feed
yourself and your family; (2) to care for your children at home and give
them all the attention, care and supervision they need. In a piecemeal
analysis, both (1) and (2) are opportunities open to that parent, but
they are not both together open to her. The point about the capability
approach is precisely that it is comprehensive; we must ask which sets
of capabilities are open to us, that is: can you simultaneously provide
for your family and properly care for and supervise your children? Or
are you rather forced to make some hard, perhaps even tragic choices
between two functionings which are both central and valuable?
Note that while most types of capability analysis require
interpersonal comparisons, one could also use the capability approach
to evaluate the wellbeing or wellbeing freedom of one person at one
point in time (e.g. evaluate her situation against a capability yardstick)
or to evaluate the changes in her wellbeing or wellbeing freedom over
29	Moreover, further extensions of this proposition may be needed. One issue is that
we should not only focus on capabilities that people value, but also on capabilities
that they do not, but should, value (see section 2.7.2). Another issue is that the
evaluative space should not necessarily be restricted to capabilities only, but could
also be functionings, or a combination of functionings and capabilities (see section
2.6.5).

2. Core Ideas and the Framework

53

time. The capability approach could thus also be used by a single person
in her deliberate decision-making or evaluation processes, but these
uses of the capability approach are much less prevalent in the scholarly
literature. Yet all these normative exercises share the property that they
use functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space — the space
in which personal evaluations or interpersonal comparisons are made.

2.6.6 A6: Other dimensions of ultimate value
However, this brings us straight to another core property of module
A, namely that functionings and/or capabilities are not necessarily the
only elements of ultimate value. Capabilitarian theories might endorse
functionings and/or capabilities as their account of ultimate value but
may add other elements of ultimate value, such as procedural fairness.
Other factors may also matter normatively, and in most capability
theories these other principles or objects of evaluation will play a role.
This implies that the capability approach is, in itself, incomplete as an
account of the good since it may have to be supplemented with other
values or principles.30 Sen has been a strong defender of this claim,
for example, in his argument that capabilities capture the opportunity
aspect of freedom but not the process aspect of freedom, which is also
important (e.g. Sen 2002a, 583–622).31
At this point, it may be useful to reflect on a suggestion made by
Henry Richardson (2015) to drop the use of the word ‘intrinsic’ when
describing the value of functionings and capabilities — as is often
done in the capability literature. For non-philosophers, saying that
something has ‘intrinsic value’ is a way to say that something is much
more important than something else, or it is used to say that we don’t
need to investigate what the effects of this object are on another object.
If we think that something doesn’t have intrinsic value, we would hold
that it is desirable if it expands functionings and capabilities; economic

30	
For example, if Henry Richardson (2007) is right in arguing that the idea of
capabilities cannot capture basic liberties, then one need not reject the capability
approach, but instead could add an insistence on basic liberties to one’s capability
theory, as Richardson (2007, 394) rightly points out.
31	This distinction, and its relevance, will be discussed in more detail in section 3.3.

54

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

growth is a prominent example in both the capability literature and in
the human development literature. Yet in philosophy, there is a longstanding debate about what it means to say of something that it has
intrinsic value, and it has increasingly been contested that it is helpful to
speak of ‘intrinsic values’ given what philosophers generally would like
to say when they use that word (Kagan 1998; Rabinowicz and RønnowRasmussen 2000).
In philosophy, the term ‘intrinsic’ refers to a metaphysical claim;
something we claim to be intrinsically valuable only derives its value
from some internal properties. Yet in the capability approach, this is not
really what we want to say about functionings (or capabilities). Rather,
as Richardson rightly argues, we should be thinking about what we
take to be worth seeking for its own sake. Richardson prefers to call
this ‘thinking in terms of final ends’; in addition, one could also use the
terminology ‘that which has ultimate value’ (see also Rabinowicz and
Rønnow-Rasmussen 2000, 48).32 This has the advantage that we do not
need to drop the widely used, and in my view very useful, distinction
between instrumental value and ultimate value. Those things that have
ultimate value are the things we seek because they are an end (of policy
making, decision making, evaluations); those things that do not have
ultimate value, hence that are not ends, will be valued to the extent that
they have instrumental value for those ends.
Of course, non-philosophers may object and argue they are using
‘intrinsic value’ and ‘ultimate value’ as synonyms. But if we want to
develop the capability approach in a way that draws on the insights
from all disciplines, we should try to accommodate this insight from
philosophy into the interdisciplinary language of the capability
approach, especially if there is a very easy-to-use alternative available
to us. We can either, as Richardson proposes, speak of the selected
functionings and capabilities as final ends, or we can say that the selected
functionings and capabilities have ultimate value — that is, they have
value as ends in themselves and not because they are useful for some
32	“[…] the relevant values can be said to be ‘end-point values’, insofar as they are
not simply conducive to or necessary for something else that is of value. They are
‘final’, then, in this sense of being ‘ultimate’” (Rabinowicz and Rønnow-Rasmussen
2000, 48).

further end. It is of course possible for a capability to have ultimate value
and for the corresponding functioning to have instrumental value. For
example, being knowledgeable and educated can very plausibly be seen
as of ultimate value, but is also of instrumental value for various other
capabilities, such as the capability of being healthy, being able to pursue
projects, being able to hold a job, and so forth.
However, the question is whether it is possible to change the use of
a term that is so widespread in some disciplines yet regarded as wrong
from the point of view of another discipline. It may be that the best
we can hope for is to become aware of the different usages of the term
‘intrinsic value’, which in the social sciences is used in a much looser
way than in philosophy, and doesn’t have the metaphysical implications
that philosophers attribute to it.

2.6.7 A7: Value pluralism
There are at least two types of value pluralism within the capability
approach. One type is the other objects of ultimate value, which was
briefly addressed in the previous section. This is what Sen called in
his Dewey lectures principle pluralism (Sen 1985c, 176). Expanding
capabilities and functionings is not all that matters; there are other
moral principles and goals with ultimate value that are also important
when evaluating social states, or when deciding what we ought to do
(whether as individuals or policy makers). Examples are deontic norms
and principles that apply to the processes that lead to the expansion
of capability sets. This value pluralism plays a very important role
in understanding the need to have the C-module C4, which will be
discussed in section 2.8.4.
It is interesting to note that at some stage in Sen’s development of
the capability approach, his readers lost this principle-pluralism and
thought that the capability approach could stand on its own. But a
reading of Sen’s earlier work on the capability approach shows that all
along, Sen felt that capabilities can and need to be supplemented with
other principles and values. For example, in his 1982 article ‘Rights and
Agency’, Sen argues that “goal rights, including capability rights, and
other goals, can be combined with deontological values […], along with

56

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

other agent-relative considerations, in an integrated system” (Sen 1982,
4). Luckily, the more recent publications in the secondary literature
on the capability approach increasingly acknowledge this principle
pluralism; the modules A7 and C4 of the modular view presented in
this book suggest that it is no longer possible not to acknowledge this
possibility.
The second type of value-pluralism relates to what is often called
the multidimensional nature of the capability approach. Functionings
and capabilities are not ‘values’ in the sense of ‘public values’ (justice,
efficiency, solidarity, ecological sustainability, etc.) but they are objects
of ultimate value — things that we value as ends in themselves. Given
some very minimal assumptions about human nature, it is obvious that
these dimensions are multiple: human beings value the opportunity to
be in good health, to engage in social interactions, to have meaningful
activities, to be sheltered and safe, not be subjected to excessive levels of
stress, and so forth. Of course, it is logically conceivable to say that for a
particular normative exercise, we only look at one dimension. But while
it may be consistent and logical, it nevertheless makes no sense — for at
least two reasons.
First, the very reason why the capability approach has been offered
as an alternative to other normative approaches is to add informational
riches — to show which dimensions have been left out of the other types of
analysis, and why adding them matters. It also makes many evaluations
much more nuanced, allowing them to reflect the complexities of life
as it is. For example, an African-American lawyer may be successful in
her professional life in terms of her professional achievements and the
material rewards she receives for her work, but she may also encounter
disrespect and humiliation in a society that is sexist and racist. Being
materially well-off doesn’t mean that one is living a life with all the
capabilities to which one should be entitled in a just society. Only multidimensional metrics of evaluation can capture those ambiguities and
informational riches.
Second, without value pluralism, it would follow that the happiness
approach is a special case of the capability approach — namely a
capability theory in which only one functioning matters, namely being
happy. Again, while this is strictly speaking a consistent and logical

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



57

possibility, it makes no sense given that the capability approach was
conceived to form an alternative to both the income metric and other
resourcist approaches on the one hand, and the happiness approach
and other mental metric approaches on the other. Thus, in order to make
the capability approach a genuine alternative to other approaches, we
need to acknowledge several functionings and capabilities, rather than
just one.

2.6.8 A8: The principle of each person as an end
A final core property of each capability theory or application is that
each person counts as a moral equal. Martha Nussbaum calls this
principle “the principle of each person as an end”. Throughout her
work she has offered strong arguments in defence of this principle
(Nussbaum 2000, 56):
The account we strive for [i.e. the capability approach] should preserve
liberties and opportunities for each and every person, taken one by one,
respecting each of them as an end, rather than simply as the agent or
supporter of the ends of others. […] We need only notice that there is a
type of focus on the individual person as such that requires no particular
metaphysical position, and no bias against love or care. It arises naturally
from the recognition that each person has just one life to live, not more
than one. […] If we combine this observation with the thought […]
that each person is valuable and worthy of respect as an end, we must
conclude that we should look not just to the total or the average, but to
the functioning of each and every person.

Nussbaum’s principle of each person as an end is the same as what is also
known as ethical or normative individualism in debates in philosophy
of science. Ethical individualism, or normative individualism, makes a
claim about who or what should count in our evaluative exercises and
decisions. It postulates that individual persons, and only individual
persons are the units of ultimate moral concern. In other words, when
evaluating different social arrangements, we are only interested in the
(direct and indirect) effects of those arrangements on individuals.
As will be explained in more detail in section 4.6, the idea of ethical
individualism is often conflated with other notions of individualism,

58

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

such as the ontological idea that human beings are individuals who can
live and flourish independently of others. However, there is no such
claim in the principle of ethical individualism. The claim is rather one
about whose interests should count. And ethical individualism claims
that only the interests of persons should count. Ultimately, we care about
each individual person. Ethical individualism forces us to make sure we
ask questions about how the interests of each and every person are served or
protected, rather than assuming that because, for example, all the other
family members are doing fine, the daughter-in-law will be doing fine
too. If, as all defensible moral theories do, we argue that every human
being has equal moral worth, then we must attach value to the interests
of each and every one of the affected persons. Thus, my first conclusion
is that ethical individualism is a desirable property, since it is necessary
to treat people as moral equals.
But ethical individualism is not only a desirable property, it is also an
unavoidable property. By its very nature the evaluation of functionings
and capabilities is an evaluation of the wellbeing and freedom to achieve
wellbeing of individual persons. Functionings are ‘beings’ and ‘doings’:
these are dimensions of a human being, which is an embodied being,
not merely a mind or a soul. And with the exception of the conjoined
twins, and the case of the unborn child and the pregnant mother, bodies
are physically separated from each other.33 We are born as a human
being with a body and future of her own, and we will die as a human
being with a body and a past life narrative that is unique. This human
being, that lives her life in an embodied way, thus has functionings that
are related to her person, which is embodied. It is with the functionings
and capabilities of these persons that the capability approach is
concerned with.34 However, as I will explain in detail in section 4.6,
from this it does not follow that the capability approach conceptualises
people in an atomistic fashion, and thus that the capability approach is
‘individualistic’ — meant in a negative, pejorative way. And it also does
not imply that a capabilitarian evaluation could not also evaluate the

33	As Richardson (2016, 5) puts it, “all capabilities […] are dependent on the body.
Without relying on one’s body there is nothing one can do or be”.
34	Some have argued in favour of what they call ‘collective capabilities’, which I will
discuss in section 3.6.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



59

means (including social institutions, structures, and norms) as well as
conversion factors, as well as non-capabilitarian elements of value — as
long as we are clear what the role or status of each of those elements is.35
Note that the use of the term ‘normative individualism’ is deeply
disputed. Some scholars see no problem at all in using that term,
since they use it in a technical sense that they believe should not be
conflated with any pejorative use of the term ‘individualism’ in daily
life. Other scholars resist the term ‘ethical individualism’, since they
cannot separate it from (a) the notions of ontological and explanatory
individualism, and/or (b) from the pejorative meaning that the term
‘individualism’ has in daily life, which is probably close to a term such
as ‘egoism’. While the first group is, in my view, right, the second group
conveys important information about how the capability approach will
be perceived in a broader setting, including outside academia. It may
therefore be recommendable to replace the term ‘ethical or normative
individualism’ with the term ‘the principle of each person as an end’
whenever possible.

2.7 The B-modules: non-optional modules with
optional content
I believe that the best way to understand the capability approach is
by taking the content of the A-module as non-optional. All capability
theories need to endorse the content of the A-module (ideally in an
explicit way) or at a very minimum should not have properties that
violate the content of the A-module. But there are also properties of a
capability theory where the module is non-optional, yet there is choice
involved in the content of the module. This doesn’t mean that ‘anything
goes’ in terms of the choice of the content, but it does mean that within
each module, there is a range of options to choose from. These are
the B-modules, each of which contains a range of possible content,
35	However, the question remains whether the capability approach is fully compatible
with indigenous world views and normative frameworks, as well as thick forms
of communitarianism. This is a question that doesn’t allow for a straightforward
answer, and requires more analysis. For some first explorations of the compatibility
of indigenous world views with the capability approach, see Binder and Binder
(2016); Bockstael and Watene (2016); Watene (2016).

60

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

from which the capability theorist can decide what content to adopt.
However, the range of content of the B-modules must not contradict the
A-module. The following table lists the non-optional B-modules with
optional content.

Meta-theoretical commitments

2.7.1 B1: The purpose of the capability theory
The first module, which is itself non-optional, but where the content
can be chosen, is the purpose of the theory. For example, one could
use the capability approach to construct a theory of justice, to develop
an international empirical comparison, to reform an educational
curriculum, to develop alternative welfare economics, or to evaluate the
effects of laws on people’s capabilities. Questions of scope and reach
also need to be addressed in this module. For example, is a theory of
justice a political or a comprehensive theory? Is such a theory domestic
or global? Other questions that need to be addressed involve the
intended audience. Is one constructing an academic theory where great
attention is given to detail and even the smallest distinctions are taken
as relevant, or is one addressing policy makers or societal organisations
for whom every detail does not matter and the time to think and read
may be much more constrained, while the accessibility of the ideas is
much more important?
Of course, one could argue that B1 is not specific to capability theories,
and also holds for, say, deontological theories, or utilitarian theories,
or theories that use care ethics as their basic normative foundation.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



61

While that is true, there are two reasons to highlight B1, the purpose of
the capability theory, in the account that I am developing. The first is
that it will help us to be explicit about the purpose. There are plenty of
pieces published in the capability literature in which the purpose of the
application or theory is not made explicit, and as a consequence it leads
to people based in different disciplines or fields talking alongside each
other. Second, it seems that the need to be explicit about the purpose
(including the audience) of one’s capability theory or application is
stronger in the capability literature than in other approaches, because
in comparison to those other approaches it has a much more radically
multidisciplinary uptake.

2.7.2 B2: The selection of dimensions
The second B-module is the selection of capabilities and/or functionings.
We need to specify which capabilities matter for our particular capability
theory. This is a deeply normative question, and touches the core of
the difference that the capability approach can make. After all, the
dimensions that one selects to analyse will determine what we will
observe — and also, equally importantly, what we will not observe
since the dimensions are not selected.
There is, by now, a large body of literature discussing the various
ways in which one can make that selection, including some overview
articles that survey the different methods for particular purposes (e.g.
Alkire 2002; Robeyns 2005a; Byskov forthcoming). These methods
explicitly include various participatory, deliberative and/or democratic
approaches, which are widely used in capability applications.
There are two crucial factors determining which selection procedure
is suitable. The first is the purpose of the capability theory (hence the
choice made in B1). If we develop an account of wellbeing for thinking
about how our lives are going, we are not constrained by questions such
as the legitimate scope of government intervention, whereas a theory of
political justice would need to take that element into account. Another
example is if we would like to use the capability approach to think about
what is universally demanded by moral principles, hence to develop
the capability approach into a theory of morality: there the selection

62

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

may be constrained by a method of moral justification for categorically
binding principles, which is much more demanding than a method
that justifies principles we offer to each other as rationally defensible
proposals in the public realm. At the empirical and policy level, similar
questions arise. For example, one could take the international human
rights treaties as reflecting a given political consensus, and use those to
select capabilities (Vizard 2007). Or, one’s main goal may be to analyse
what difference the capability approach makes for poverty or inequality
analysis in comparison with income metrics, in which case one may opt
for a method that makes the normativity explicit but nevertheless stays
close to existing practices in the social sciences, assuming the epistemic
validity of those practices (Robeyns 2003).
The second factor determining which selection procedure is suitable
is the set of constraints one takes as given in the normative analysis one is
making. In an ideal world, there would always be cooperation between
scholars with different disciplinary expertise, who would understand
each other well, and who would be able to speak the language of the
other disciplines involved in developing the capability theory. In an
ideal world, there would also be no time constraints on the amount of
time one has to develop a capability theory, and no financial constraints
on the data gathering, or social, psychological or political constraints
on the types of question one can ask when conducting a survey. One
would be able always to conduct one’s own fieldwork if one wanted,
one would have access to all the empirical knowledge one needed, and
one would not be constrained in gathering the information one wanted
to gather. Clearly, the methods for such an ideal world would be very
different from the methods that are used in practice — where databasedriven selection may be the best one can do.
Still, whichever method one uses, what always remains important,
and very much in the spirit of the capability approach, is not to act in a
mechanical way, or to see the question of the selection of dimensions as
a technocratic exercise. Even if one cannot, for example, collect certain
data, one could nevertheless still mention the dimensions that one would
have wanted to include if it had been possible, and perhaps provide
some reasonable informed guess of what difference the inclusion of that
dimension would have made.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework

2.7.3 B3: Human diversity
Within the capability approach human diversity is a core characteristic,
and indeed a core motivation for developing the capability approach
in the first place. Yet the account of human diversity that one endorses
can differ. For example, scholars with a background in structuralist
sociology or Marxism often believe that the social class to which one
belongs is a very important factor in human diversity, which has great
influence on which options lie open to a person, but also on how a
person’s character and aspirations are formed. For those scholars, class
interacts with, and in some cases even outweighs, all other identity
aspects. For others, such as libertarians, these differences are not so
important.36 They would not attach much (normative or explanatory)
importance to one’s gender, ethnicity, race, social class, and so forth:
everyone is, first and foremost, an individual whose personal ambitions
and projects matter. Yet, whether one is a Marxist or a libertarian or one
of the many other positions one can take, one always, either implicitly
or explicitly, endorses a view on human nature and on human diversity.
That choice should be made in capability theories, since the capability
approach rejects the use of an implicit, unacknowledged account of
human diversity. Hence such an account belongs to the B-modules: one
has to have an account of human diversity, but, as long as one is willing
to defend one’s account and it survives critical analysis, there are several
accounts that one can opt for.
Note that if one puts all the modules A, B and C together, a picture
will emerge about the great importance attached to human diversity in
the capability approach; this will be analysed in more detail in section 3.5.

2.7.4 B4: Agency
Another B-module is the acknowledgement of agency. As a working
definition, we can use Sen’s definition of an agent as “someone who
acts and brings about change, and whose achievements can be judged in

36	For an introduction to libertarianism, see Vallentyne and Van der Vossen (2014).

64

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

terms of her own values and objectives, whether or not we assess them
in terms of some external criteria as well” (Sen 1999a, 19).
Applications of the capability approach should endorse some account
of agency, except if there are good reasons why agency should be taken
to be absent, or why in a particular capability application agency is
simply not relevant (for example, when one wants to investigate the
correlation between an income metric and some achieved functionings).
But clearly, as with other key ethical concepts such as ‘wellbeing’ or
‘freedom’, the concept of ‘agency’ can be fleshed out in many different
ways. The capability approach is not committed to one particular account
of agency. Similar to the acknowledgement of structural constraints,
there is no agreed-upon or standard claim about how much agency, or
what particular type, should be assumed; the claim is minimalistic in
the sense that, as with the structural constraints which will be discussed
in the next section, agency cannot simply be ignored and must be
accounted for. One can give agency a key role in a capability theory (e.g.
Crocker 2008; Claassen 2016) or a more restricted role, perhaps also using
different terminology. One can also develop the account of agency by
spelling out some of its preconditions, which may include capabilities.
For example, Tom de Herdt (2008) analysed the capability of not
having to be subjected to public shame as a precondition of agency, and
showed how this may be relevant for social policymaking by illustrating
its importance in a food relief programme in Kinshasa. For empirical
scholars and policy scholars, an empirically sound account of agency
will be crucial; for moral philosophers, a more theoretical account of
what conceptualisation of agency is morally relevant will be needed.
Thus, the precise content of this B-module will differ significantly
between different capability theories and applications — but, in all
cases, some acknowledgement of agency will be needed.37

37	Martha Nussbaum explicitly refrains from integrating the notion of ‘agency’ in her
capability theory (Nussbaum 2000, 14). However, this does not mean that there isn’t
an account of agency in her theory, since the inclusion of the capability of practical
reason on her list of central human capabilities can be understood as corresponding
to one particular conceptualisation of agency.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



65

2.7.5 B5: Structural constraints
The fifth B-module is the account of structural constraints: the institutions,
policies, laws, social norms and so forth, that people in different social
positions face. Those differences in the structural constraints that people
face can have a great influence on their conversion factors, and hence
on their capability sets. For example, if relationships between people
of the same sex are criminalised, then gay people may have all the
means and resources they would wish, but they will still not be able to
enjoy a happy family life. Or if people of colour face explicit or implicit
discrimination on the labour market, then they will not be able to use
the same labour-market resources (their degrees, training, experience)
to generate the same levels of capabilities in the professional sphere of
life, compared with groups that face no (or less) discrimination.
In addition, structural constraints also play a role in the shaping
of people’s capabilities that are not heavily dependent on material
resources. If one group of people is, for cultural, historical or religious
reasons, stigmatized as outcasts, then they will be treated with
disrespect by other groups in society. The same holds for all groups
that suffer from stigma, such as, for example, people with psychiatric
disorders or other mental health issues. These structural constraints will
also affect the capabilities that do not rely on resources directly, such as
opportunities for friendships or for a healthy sense of self-confidence.
Which of those structural constraints will be important for a
particular capability analysis will depend on the context. For example,
in her study of the living standards of waste pickers, scavengers, and
plastic recycling and scrap trading entrepreneurs in Delhi, Kaveri Gill
(2010) showed that caste plays a very important role in the capability
sets of different castes. For example, those at the very bottom of the
hierarchical ladder of waste workers — the waste pickers — have no
opportunities for upward mobility due to social norms and societal
discrimination related to their caste. In this study, social norms related
to caste are key as a structural constraint; in other studies, it may be the
anatomy of twenty-first century capitalism, or gender norms in genderstratified societies, or some other set of structural constraints.

66

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

In sum, structural constraints can have a very important role in
shaping people’s capability sets, and therefore have to be part of
capability theories. Structural constraints vary depending on one’s
caste, class, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, (dis)abilities, and
the economic system in which one lives. These structural constraints
are very likely to have an influence on a person’s capability set (and in
most cases also do have that influence). Having an account of structural
constraints is therefore non-optional: every capability theory has one,
although sometimes this account will be very implicit. For example, I
will argue in section 4.10 that part of the critique of mainstream welfare
economics is that it has a very weak or minimal account of structural
constraints. Heterodox welfare economists who are embracing the
capability approach are not only doing so because they think the
endorsement of the capability account of wellbeing is better than the
preferences-based accounts that are dominant in mainstream economics,
but often also because they hope that the minimal account of structural
constraints in welfare economics can be replaced by a richer account
that is better informed by insights from the other social sciences and
from the humanities.

2.7.6 B6: The choice between functionings,
capabilities, or both
In developing a capability theory, we need to decide whether we think
that what matters are capabilities, functionings, or a combination of
both. The core proposition that functionings and capabilities form
the evaluative space (A5), was not decisive regarding the question of
whether it is only functionings, or only capabilities, or a mixture of both,
that form this space.
There are various arguments given in the literature defending a
range of views that only capabilities matter; or that primarily secured
functionings matter; or that for particular capability theories it is
impossible only to focus on capabilities; or that we sometimes have good
reasons to focus on functionings. These various claims and arguments
will be reviewed in section 3.4; as will be argued in that section, there
are good reasons why people could reasonably disagree on whether the
capability analysis they are conducting should focus on functionings or

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



67

capabilities or a mixture. It follows that a choice must be made, but that
there are various options to choose from.

2.7.7 B7: Meta-theoretical commitments
Finally, each capability theory will embrace some meta-theoretical
commitments. Yet often, these meta-theoretical commitments are
shared commitments within one’s discipline or one’s school within
that discipline, and as a graduate student one has become socialised
in accepting these meta-theoretical commitments as given. As a
consequence, it often happens that scholars are not even aware that
there are such things as meta-theoretical commitments. For example,
if one wants to conduct a measurement exercise (a choice made in the
module B1) then one may be committed to the methodological principle
of parsimony (to build a model with as few assumptions and as elegantly
as possible) or, instead, to providing a measurement that is embedded
into a rich narrative description aimed at a better understanding. Or,
if one wants to construct a theory of justice (again, a choice made in
the module B1), then one may aim for an ideal or non-ideal theory
of justice, or for a partial or a comprehensive account of justice. Or
one may espouse certain views about the status of theories of justice
or meta-ethical claims related to, for example, the role that intuitions
are permitted to play as a source of normativity. Some debates within
the capability approach, but also between capability scholars and
those working in other paradigms, would be truly enlightened if we
made the meta-theoretical commitments of our theories, accounts and
applications more explicit.

2.8 The C-modules: contingent modules
In addition to the compulsory content of the core A-module, and the
optional content of the non-optional B-modules, a capability theory
could also add a third type of module, which I will call the contingent
modules. These are either modules that need to be taken on board due
to some choices that have been made in a B-module, or else they are
entirely optional, independent of what one has chosen in the B-modules.
The following table gives an overview of the contingent modules.

68

2.8.1 C1: Additional ontological and explanatory theories
Two capabilitarian thinkers could each aspire to make a theory of justice,
yet embrace very different views on human nature and on the degree to
which certain outcomes can be explained solely by people’s choices or
are also affected by structural constraints. This can matter a lot for the
particular capability theories that one develops.
For example, in earlier work, I showed that the capability approach’s
answer to whether there is anything wrong with the traditional gender
division of labour depends a lot on the social ontological claims related to
gender that are (implicitly) endorsed as well as the explanatory views of
how that division of labour came about (Robeyns 2008c). If one believes
that the fact that women end up doing most of the unpaid and care
work, while men end up doing most of the paid labour market work, is
a result of differences in talents, dispositions and preferences, then one
would judge that the different functionings outcomes that result for men
and women within households provide them with maximal levels of
wellbeing given the formal institutional background that they face. But
if one endorses a feminist explanation of this division of labour between
men and women within households, then one is likely to stress power
differences, the role of societal expectations and social norms in decision
making, and so forth (e.g. Okin 1989; Folbre 1994). The same observed
functionings outcomes in households with a traditional gender division
of labour would then be evaluated differently.
Similarly, Miriam Teschl and Laurent Derobert argue that a range of
different accounts of social and personal identity are possible, and this
may also impact on how we interpret a person forfeiting a capability that
we would all deem valuable (Teschl and Derobert 2008). If we believe that

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



69

our religious identities are a matter of rational deliberation and decisionmaking, then we will judge the choice to physically self-harm because of
one’s religion differently than if we have an account of identity where
there is much less scope for choice and rational deliberation regarding
our religious affiliation or other group memberships.
In short, different ontological and explanatory options are available
in module C1, and they may have effects on various other elements or
dimensions of the capability theory that are being constructed. However,
we should be careful and not mistakenly conclude that ‘anything goes’
when we add additional ontological theories, since there should not be
any conflicts with the propositions of the A-module — and, in addition,
some ontological and explanatory accounts are much better supported
by critical analysis and empirical knowledge.

2.8.2 C2: Weighing dimensions
For some capability theories, the prioritising, weighing or aggregating
of dimensions (functionings and capabilities) may not be needed. For
example, one may simply want to describe how a country has developed
over time in terms of a number of important functionings, as a way of
giving information about the evolution of the quality of life that may
give different insights than the evolution of GDP (e.g. Van Zanden
et al. 2014). Weighing dimensions is therefore not required for each
capability theory or capability application, in contrast to the selection of
dimensions, which is inevitable.
However, for some other choices that one can make in B1, the
capabilitarian scholar or practitioner needs to make choices related to
the weighing of the different dimensions. If that is the case, then there are
different methods for how one could weigh. When considering which
weighing method to use, the same factors are relevant as in the case of
selecting the dimensions: the purposes of one’s capability theory, and
the constraints one has to take into account when choosing a method.
In contrast to the overview works that have been written on how to
select dimensions (e.g. Alkire 2002; Robeyns 2005a; Byskov forthcoming),
capability scholars have written much less about which methods one
could use to decide on the weights given to each dimension, specifically

70

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

focussing on functionings or capabilities as the dimensions. What
lessons and insights can we learn from what has so far been argued in
this literature on the weighing of dimensions? (Alkire 2016; Alkire et al.
2015, chapter 6; Robeyns 2006b, 356–58)
First, the selection of weights for the capability approach is structurally
similar to other multidimensional metrics (in the case of evaluations)
or decision-making procedures (in case one needs to decide to which
capabilities to give priority in policies or collective decision making).
Hence one should consult existing discussions in other debates where
multidimensionality plays an important role. Let us first look at the
group of applications in which the capability approach is used to make
decisions about what we, collectively, ought to do. That may be in an
organisation; or at the level of a community that needs to decide whether
to spend tax revenues on investing more in public green spaces, or in
social services for particular groups, or in taking measures to prevent
crime, or in anything else that can likely be understood as leading to
positive effects on our capabilities. In those cases, we can learn from
social choice theory, and from theories of democratic decision making,
how we could proceed.38 Decisions could be made by voting, or by
deliberation, or by deliberation and/or voting among those who are the
representatives of the relevant population.
Second, the applications of the capability approach that involve a
multidimensional metric of wellbeing or wellbeing freedom could
use (most of) the weighing methods that have been discussed for
multidimensional metrics in general. Koen Decancq and María Ana
Lugo (2013) have reviewed eight different approaches to set weights
for multidimensional metrics, which they categorize in three classes:
data-driven weights in which the weights are a function of the
distribution of the various dimensions in the population surveyed;
normative approaches in which either experts decide on the weights,
or the weights are equal or arbitrary; and hybrid weights that are in

38	In the case of democratic theory, the discussion is often about which laws to
implement, but the same insights apply to policy making. Both the literature on
democratic theory (e.g. Dryzek 2000; Gutmann and Thompson 2004) and social
choice theory (e.g. Arrow, Sen and Suzumura 2002, 2010; Sen 1999c, 2017; Gaertner
2009) are vast and will not be further discussed here.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework

71

part data-driven but in addition depend on some normative decision.
Note that in the data-driven and hybrid approaches, the selection of
dimensions and the weights tends to be done through a process in
which the selection of dimensions and the determination of the weights
go hand in hand. One example is the proposal by Erik Schokkaert
(2007) of using happiness as the master-value by which we weigh the
various capabilities that together form the multidimensional account of
wellbeing. In this proposal, if the functionings do not contribute to one’s
happiness, they are given a zero weight and hence no longer count in
the wellbeing index. In methods such as this one, there are two rounds
of the selections of the dimensions: the first before one collects the data,
and the second when one uses econometric techniques to determine
the contribution that the various functionings make to the master-value
(here: life-satisfaction) and uses those as weights; those functionings
that will make no contribution will receive a weight of zero, which is
the same as being deleted as a dimension in the wellbeing index.
Third, for non-empirical applications, we can categorize methods
to determine weights in the same way as we could categorise methods
for the selection of dimensions. Morten Fibieger Byskov (forthcoming)
distinguishes between ad-hoc methods (such as the data-driven methods
discussed by Decancq and Lugo), procedural methods, or foundational
methods. A theoretical capability application could include answers to
all B-modules (including the selection of dimensions) yet decide that
the weighing of those dimensions should be done in a procedural way,
e.g. via a democratic decision-making process. Alternatively, one could
introduce one master-value that will determine which capabilities are
relevant, and also what weights they should be given. One example is
the empirical work done by Erik Schokkaert (2007), which was discussed
above. Another example, which is theoretical, is Rutger Claassen’s
capabilitarian theory of justice, in which the selection and weighing
of capabilities is done based on their contribution to that person’s
“navigational agency” (Claassen 2016).
Note that in the case in which one has essentially a monistic theory
in which there is a master-value, one may doubt whether this doesn’t
violate property A7 from the A-module. At first value, it seems that it
does. But proponents of a monistic theory may respond that all theories

72

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

or measures ultimately must choose one principle or value that tells
us something about the relative weight of the different dimensions. In
Nussbaum’s work, they argue, there is also an implicit master-value,
namely human dignity. It seems to me that this issue is not sufficiently
analysed and the dispute not settled. One question one could raise
is whether all master-values have the same function. It seems to be
different whether the capabilities constitute the dimensions of a good life
(as in the case of flourishing), or whether they contribute to the mastervalue. For the time being, we should in any case flag this as an issue to
which more attention should be paid in the further development of our
understanding of the capability approach.

2.8.3 C3: Methods for empirical analysis.
If in B1 one chooses an empirical study, one needs to know which
methods to use. This is the task of the module C3. For example, the study
could contain choices about which multivariate analysis tools to use or
whether certain existing data sets are capturing functionings, capabilities,
or merely rough indicators. In C3, we also make methodological choices
related to empirical analysis: does a particular capability issue require
quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, or a combination? In part, the
contours of the empirical analysis will be influenced by one’s ambitions
and goals: is one trying to measure functionings and/or capabilities
directly, or is one measuring resources and conversion factors in order
to infer the capability set?
For empirical capability applications, these are of course huge
methodological questions that need to be answered. These empirical
methods questions may be particularly challenging for the capability
approach for two reasons. First, because it is a radically multidimensional
approach, and multidimensional analysis is by its very nature more
complicated than a one-dimensional analysis. Second, in many cases, the
relevant dimensions will include dimensions on which the collection of
data is difficult, or on which no data are available — such as the quality
of our social networks, the degree to which we do not suffer from
excessive levels of stress, or our mental health. Nevertheless, as Alkire

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



73

(2005, 129) rightly points out in her discussion on what is needed for
the empirical operationalisation of the capability approach, one has to
adopt the best existing empirical research (and its methods) that exists,
and either master those new techniques that have been developed in
other fields, or else engage in collaborations. Hick and Burchardt (2016,
88) raise the related point that there is a need for capability scholars
to reach out and engage with related fields where similar themes and
problems are faced. Only after that route has been travelled can we
know the limits of empirical analyses of the capability approach.

2.8.4 C4: Additional normative principles and concerns
Finally, module C4 provides room for additional normative concerns or
moral principles that capability scholars aim to add to their capability
theory. For example, in a particular capability theory, a principle of
non-discrimination may play a role or, alternatively, one may want to
work out a capabilitarian theory that subscribes to the non-domination
principle as it has been defended by Republican political theory (Pettit
2001, 2009). Or, if one ascribes to a rich account of empowerment that
stresses the relevance of ‘power’ and hence strongly incorporates
relational aspects (e.g. Drydyk 2013; Koggel 2013), then one may add
a principle related to enhancing people’s empowerment, or prioritising
the empowerment of the worst-off, as an additional normative principle
to be added in module C4. Again, there are several elements belonging
to module C4 that could be added to a capability theory.

2.9 The modular view of the
capability account: a summary
In the previous sections, we have looked at the different elements of
the modular account of the capability approach, consisting of the core
A-module, the compulsory B-modules with optional content, and the
contingent C-modules. For an easily accessible overview, the different
elements of the modular view of the capability approach are summarised
in table 2.5.

74

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Table 2.5 The modular view of the capability approach
The A-module: the non-optional core
A1: Functionings and capabilities as core concepts
A2: Functionings and capabilities are value-neutral categories
A3: Conversion factors
A4: The distinction between means and ends
A5: Functionings and/or capabilities form the evaluative space
A6: Other dimensions of ultimate value
A7: Value pluralism
A8: Valuing each person as an end
The B-modules: non-optional modules with optional content
B1: The purpose of the capability theory
B2: The selection of dimensions
B3: An account of human diversity
B4: An account of agency
B5: An account of structural constraints
B6: The choice between functionings, capabilities, or both
B7: Meta-theoretical commitments
The C-modules: contingent modules
C1: Additional ontological and explanatory theories
C2: Weighing dimensions
C3: Methods for empirical analysis
C4: Additional normative principles and concerns

What, exactly, is the status of this characterisation of the capability
approach? Is this list of modules and the core properties exhaustive,
and is this a proposal to change the current definitions on offer in the
literature?
The answers have been given throughout the sections so far, but
now that we have gone through the different modules and know their
content, it is worthwhile to repeat and summarize this in a very explicit
manner. The modular view is an attempt at understanding the plurality
of capability theories on offer in the literature, doing justice to this
plurality, yet at the same time avoiding the idea that ‘anything goes’.
By distinguishing between three types of modules — the A-module,

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



75

the content of which one must adopt, the B-modules, which are nonoptional but have optional content, and the C-modules, which are
contingent — we can get a better grasp of the peculiar nature of the
capability approach: not exactly a precise theory, but also not something
that can be anything one likes it to be. I hope that this way of looking at
the anatomy of the capability approach will help us to understand what
the approach is, but also provide more guidance to those who want to
use the general capability approach as a guiding theoretical framework
to work on particular theoretical or empirical issues and problems.
The content of the A-module, the B-modules and C-modules is,
as with everything in scholarship, a proposal that can be modified
to accommodate new insights. If someone has convincing arguments
why one element or module should be deleted, modified, or added,
then that should be done. Given what we know from the history of
scholarship, it is rather unlikely that no further modifications will be
proposed in the future.

2.10 Hybrid theories
In the previous sections, we have seen which modules are core in a
capability theory, which ones need to be addressed but have optional
content, and which ones may or may not be necessary to add to a
particular capability theory. One question that this modular view raises is
what we should think of a theory or an application that uses the addition
of normative principles that are in contradiction with a property of the
A-module. For example, suppose one would want to add the normative
principle that institutions and personal behaviour should honour the
traditions of one’s local community. There may be aspects of those
traditions that are in tension with the principle of treating each person
as an end, for example, because women are not given the same moral
status in those traditions as men. What should we then say? Would such
a theory no longer be a capability theory, even if the bulk of the theory is
trying to think about the quality of life and desirable institutions in terms
of the enhancement of functionings and capabilities?
I propose that we introduce the notion of a hybrid theory — theories
or applications that use the notions of ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’

76

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

yet do not endorse all propositions in the A-module. Let me stress that
categorizing these theories as ‘hybrid’ entails no value judgement,
whether positive or negative; rather, it is only a matter of clarifying the
possibilities of having capability theories but in addition also hybrid
theories which use part of the A-module yet also insert elements from
other ethical frameworks that go against some propositions in the
A-module. Thus, appreciating the possibility of hybrid views enlarges
the diversity of theories that are possible.
Can we give an example of such a hybrid theory? Perhaps surprisingly,
an example may be Amartya Sen’s theorising about justice. According to
the interpretation by Antoinette Baujard and Muriel Gilardone (2017),
Sen’s (2006, 2009c) recent work on justice does not endorse functionings
and/or capabilities as the metric of justice, but should rather be seen
as a procedural or democratic account of justice, in which the idea of
having functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space is merely
a suggestion, which should be put to the public who eventually, in a
process of public reasoning, have to decide what justice is about. If that
interpretation is correct, then Sen is unwilling to commit to proposition
A5 (‘functionings and capabilities form the evaluative space’) when
theorising about justice, since that is something to be decided by a
process of public reasoning.39 Clearly, when Sen theorises about justice,
he has certain meta-theoretical commitments (module B7) that make
it inconsistent for him to endorse A5, namely the meta-theoretical
commitment that the nature of justice will be decided by a democratic
process. Whether that is a plausible meta-theoretical position, has been
subject of debate in the capability literature (e.g. Claassen 2011; Byskov
2017) but need not concern us here. The point that is relevant for us is
that Sen’s theorizing about justice could be seen as a public reasoningcapability theory of justice.
39	Note that for other capability applications or capability theories, such as making quality
of life assessment studies, Sen has no problem endorsing proposition A5. Moreover,
one could also ask whether regarding his earlier publications on justice it would be
implausible to interpret Sen’s writings as an endorsement of A5. In my view (and
pace Baujard and Gilardone’s interpretation), Sen has made several statements in
earlier work that could be seen as an endorsement of all propositions of module A
for the case of theorizing about justice (e.g. Sen 1980, 1990a, 2000).

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



77

Other potential candidates for hybrid theories are the theories that
we discussed in section 2.8.2, in which functionings and capabilities
play an important role, yet in the theory or measurement construction
those functionings and capabilities turn out not to be of ultimate value,
but rather to be instrumental for some further end that is normatively
prior to the functionings and capabilities themselves. There is, in
those cases, a master-value that determines how important (if at all)
those capabilities are: capabilities that we could value, but which do
not contribute to the master-value, will then not be given any ultimate
value. As we discussed there, it is unclear whether those theories that
endorse a master-value violate module A7 (value pluralism) or not. If
we conclude they do, then the best way to understand these views is to
regard them as hybrid theories too.

2.11 The relevance and implications of the
modular view
Understanding the capability approach as having a modular structure
leads to a number of insights. Let me highlight three important ones:
countering the risk of inflation, whereby we have no criteria for deciding
when a theory is or is not a capability theory; appreciating the diversity
of capability theories that are possible; and getting a better sense of how
Sen’s and Nussbaum’s writings relate to each other.
First, the modular view can help us to contain the risk of inflation: too
many things being labelled as belonging to the ‘capability approach’,
whereas they do not meet the essential characteristics of the A-module.
The modular view of the capability approach which I presented gives us
a description that includes all the work in the capability approach that
should legitimately be included. There are, of course, other descriptions
of the capability approach available in the literature. Yet to my mind
most of these descriptions (including my own previous attempts at
describing the approach) were insufficiently detailed and illuminating.
If a description is too vague, we run the risk of inflation.
For example, one could aim to work on multi-dimensional poverty
analysis and highlight the fact that we should be interested in the

78

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

combination of achievements that people are able to have. This would
point at two important insights in the capability approach — namely
its multidimensional character, as well as focussing on opportunity
sets rather than on outcomes. But if the opportunities one focusses on
are not capabilities, but rather opportunities to access certain bundles
of commodities, then it would be an unjustified inflation to call this a
capability application; rather, it would be another type of opportunitybased multidimensional inequality measure.
Second, to understand that capability theories have a modular
structure is crucial in understanding the diversity of capability theories
that are possible. Let me try to illustrate this. Module C4 states that
additional normative principles may be part of a capability theory, and
property A6 that functionings and capabilities are not necessarily all
that matters in a capability theory. From this it does not follow that all
capability scholars have to endorse each and every capability theory.
Surely there will be capability theorists who will take issue with the
normative principles that are added in module C4 by other capability
theorists when they design their theory. That is perfectly fine, as long
as both theorists recognise that (a) the capability approach entails the
possibility to add such additional normative principles in module C4,
and (b) the normative principles they have added in module C4 are not
thereby required for each and every other capability theory.40
Take the following example. One may defend a political theory of
disadvantage which states that no-one should live in poverty, no matter
whether people are partly causally responsible for having ended up in
that situation. Such a theory would endorse a principle (in module C4)
that there should be, at the level of outcomes (and hence not at the level of
opportunities) institutionally enforced solidarity via redistribution. Let
us call those who endorse this principle the S-theorists (S for solidarity).
This is a strong normative claim: many other normative political theories
40	
I believe that Martha Nussbaum makes a mistake when she argues that a
commitment to the normative principle of political liberalism is essential to the
capability approach, hence to each and every capability theory. For my arguments
why this is a mistake, see Robeyns (2016b). Political liberalism is an additional
normative commitment that is not a property of the A-module, but rather a choice
in module C4.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



79

rather defend that everyone should have a genuine opportunity to
live a decent life, but still attribute some responsibility to all persons
for realising that life. Let us call these theorists the O-theorists (O for
opportunity). Both the S-theorists and the O-theorists can agree that
we should understand people’s wellbeing in terms of functionings and
capabilities. The S-theorists and the O-theorists are both capabilitarians.
They have to acknowledge that the other group’s theory is a capability
theory, without having to endorse the other theory. In other words, a
capability theorist can agree that the normative position or theory that
someone else is defending is a capability theory, without having to
endorse that specific theory. There is absolutely no inconsistency in this
situation.
Thirdly, the modular view of the capability approach endorses
the view that Martha Nussbaum’s work on the capability approach
should be understood as a capability theory, that is, a theory in
which specific choices are made regarding the modules. It is not, as
Nussbaum (2011) suggests in her Creating Capabilities, a version of
the capability approach structurally on a par with Sen’s more general
capability approach. What Sen has tried to do in his work on the
capability approach, is to carve out the general capability approach, as
well as to give some more specific capability applications. Admittedly,
Sen’s work on the capability approach (rather than his work on a
variety of capability applications) would have benefited from a more
systematic description of how he saw the anatomy of the capability
approach. To my mind, that has been missing from his work, and that
is what I have tried to develop here and in an earlier paper (Robeyns
2016b). Yet everything put together, I agree with the understanding
of Mozaffar Qizilbash, who concludes an analysis of the difference
between Nussbaum’s and Sen’s work on the capability approach by
saying that “On this reading […] Nussbaum’s capabilities approach
emerges as one particular application or development of Sen’s original
formulation of the approach” (Qizilbash 2013, 38).
It is a mistake to understand the capability literature as a field
with two major thinkers who have each proposed one version
of the capability approach, which have then inspired the work by
many other scholars. Rather, there is only one capability approach

80

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

which is a generalisation of the work by Sen together with further
developments by many others. In addition, there are many dozens
capability theories — about justice, human rights, social choice theory,
welfare economics, poverty measurement, relational egalitarianism,
curriculum design, development project assessment, technological
design, and so forth. Clearly, Nussbaum has been one of the most
prolific and important contributors; she has pushed the boundaries of
capabilitarian theories and has rightly advanced the agenda to achieve
more clarity on the essential characteristics that any capability theory
should meet. However, she has offered us a more specific capability
theory, rather than another version of the approach, even if it is the
capability theory that is by far the most influential capability theory
among philosophers. Establishing the anatomy of the capability
approach and its relation to particular capability theories is very
important, because it vastly expands the scope of the capability
approach, and increases the potential types of capability applications
and capabilitarian theories.
In sum, there is much pluralism within the capability approach.
Someone who considers herself a capabilitarian or capability thinker
does not need to endorse all capability theories. In fact, it is impossible
to endorse all capability theories, since different choices made in
module C1 (ontological and explanatory theories that are endorsed)
and module C4 (additional normative principles) can be in conflict with
each other. It is presumably coherent to be a Marxist capabilitarian, and
it is presumably also coherent to be a libertarian capabilitarian, but it is
not coherent to endorse the views taken by those two positions, since
they are incompatible.

2.12 A visualisation of the core
conceptual elements
We have now covered enough ground in understanding the core
concepts of the capability approach to construct a visualisation of
these concepts. Figure 2.1 below gives a graphical representation of the
different elements of the capability approach, and how they relate. Note

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



81

that the arrows do not indicate normative importance but rather indicate
which parts of this conceptual system are determinants of, or have an
influence on, other parts.
Let us start our description where economists generally start (and
often also end): with resources. In the capability approach, the term
‘resources’ is interpreted in a broader sense than the understanding
of that term elsewhere in the social sciences. Economics and the
quantitative empirical social sciences have traditionally focussed
on material resources only: either income and wealth, or else on
the consumption that these financial means (or unpaid production)
generated. One important lesson learnt from feminist economics is that
about half of economic production happens outside the market and the
formal economy, which is the reason why the box at the far left in Figure
2.1 also includes resources created by non-market production (Folbre
2008; Folbre and Bittman 2004).
Both the resources and the consumption could be conceptualised as
capability inputs: they are the means to the opportunities to be the person
one wants to be, and do what one has reason to value doing. The means
do not all have the same power to generate capabilities; this depends on
a person’s conversion factors, as well as the structural constraints that
she faces. Those structural constraints can have a great influence on the
conversion factors as well as on the capability sets directly.
From this visualisation, we can also see the difference between the
social conversion factors and the structural constraints. The structural
constraints affect a person’s set of conversion factors, including the social
conversion factors she faces. But recall that those conversion factors tell
us something about the degree to which people can turn resources into
capabilities. Conversion factors are thus, conceptually and empirically,
closely related to the capability inputs — that is, the resources that are
needed to generate capabilities. Structural constraints affect conversion
factors, but can also affect a person’s capability set without impacting on
the conversion of resources in capabilities. For example, if a certain set
of social norms characterizes a group in society as not having the same
moral status as others, then this affects the capabilities of the members
of that group directly, not merely in terms of what they can get out of

82

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

their resources. A good example is gay people, a significant percentage
of whom are not worse off in financial terms than straight people, but
they often cannot express their sexual orientation in public, at the risk of
humiliation, aggression, or even risking their jobs or their lives.
Another part of the visualisation to pay attention to is the choice
that people make given the capability set they have. These choices are
always constrained in some sense, and the question is which types of
constraints a particular capability theory will take into account. Also, the
term ‘choice’ is used here in a very thin (or, as philosophers say, ‘weak’)
sense: it is not assumed that elaborate thinking and weighing is done
before we decide which capabilities to use and realise into functionings.
In fact, we have ample evidence from psychology that there are many
other factors that influence the decisions we make, including how
hungry or tired we are, the people in our company, or the amount of
time we have to make a decision (Ariely 2010; Kahneman 2011). Most
capability theories will have an (implicit) theory of choice: they will
have views on the extent to which people’s past history (which includes
the structural constraints they faced in their personal past) as well as
societal processes, such as preference formation mechanisms, influence
the choices that we make from the opportunities that are available to us.
The last element of the visualisation is the level of satisfaction
or dissatisfaction with one’s functionings and capability levels each
person will have. Of course, this does not mean that we need to attribute
ethical significance to those levels of satisfaction; rather, the point in the
visualisation is that satisfaction with one’s functionings and capability
levels is not the same thing as those capability sets and combination of
functionings achievements themselves. For now, we will concentrate on
deepening our understanding of the capability approach itself, but in
section 3.8, we will engage in more depth with the question whether we
should look at functionings and capabilities, rather than satisfaction, or
some other mental metrics, such as happiness.
Two remarks are important. First, this is a stylized visualisation, and
also a simplification. It is meant to help us see the different elements
of the capability approach and how they relate; it is not a fine-grained
and exhaustive picture of all the elements that determine a person’s
capability set. One important limitation is that this is not a dynamic
visualisation and that many arrows, indicating relationships between



84

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

various parts, are not present.41 In addition, the choices we make
from our capability set at one point in time, will be determinants of
our resources and our capability set in the future. Another important
limitation of this visualisation is that it gives us only the resources,
capabilities, functionings and satisfaction of one person, but, as was
mentioned before, capability sets are interdependent; hence choices
made from one person’s capability set will lead to changes in another
person’s capability set.

2.13 The narrow and broad uses
of the capability approach
We have now reached the end of the discussion of the modular view
of the capability approach. Yet before closing this chapter, let us pause
to use this modular view to clarify something that has been noted by
several capability scholars, namely that the capability approach has
been used and can be used in narrower or more limited ways on the one
hand, and broader or richer ways on the other (e.g. Alkire, Qizilbash
and Comim 2008, 4–5; Crocker and Robeyns 2009; Qizilbash 2012).42 The
distinction has been slightly differently presented by different authors,
but the general gist of their analyses has been that the capability
approach can either be seen as offering something limited, or else much
more ambitious and wide-reaching:
[…] several interpretations of the scope of the capability approach are
used in the wider literature […]. These can be charted between two
poles: one narrow and broad, with the broad subsuming the narrow.
[…] The narrow interpretation sees the approach primarily as identifying

41	In reality, almost everything is related to almost everything else in one way or
another, but putting all those arrows on a visualisation would make it completely
uninformative. After all, the task of scholarship is to abstract away from distracting
details to see more clearly.
42	Readers who have never come across that distinction between the narrow and
broad use of the capability approach may simply ignore this section and move on,
since the anatomy of the capability approach that has been presented in this book
covers the same terrain. In essence, this section is written for those who came across
this terminology in the literature, and wonder how it relates to what has been said
so far in this book.

2. Core Ideas and the Framework



85

capability and functionings as the primary informational space for
certain exercises. The broad interpretation views the capability approach
as providing a more extensive and demanding evaluative framework,
for example by introducing human rights or plural principles beyond
the expansion of capabilities — principles which embody other values
of concerns such as equity, sustainability or responsibility. (Alkire,
Qizilbash and Comim 2008, 4–5)

In the narrow way, the capability approach tells us what information we
should look at if we are to judge how well someone’s life is going or has
gone; this kind of information is needed in any account of wellbeing or
human development, or for any kind of interpersonal comparisons. Since
the capability approach contends that the relevant kind of information
concerns human functionings and capabilities, the approach provides
part of what is needed for interpersonal comparisons of advantage.
The modular view presented in this chapter can help to make sense
of this observation that there is both a narrower and a wider use of the
capability approach. In the narrow use of the capability approach, the
focus is often strictly on the evaluation of individual functioning levels
or on both functionings and capabilities. If we look at the narrow use of
the capability approach through the lens of the modular understanding
of the approach, we can see that the narrow view chooses interpersonal
comparisons as the purpose of the capability theory (module B1); and
that it will have to make a selection of dimensions (module B2) and make
a choice between functionings or capabilities (module B6); its choice for
human diversity (module B3) will be reflected in the choices it makes in
B2, but also in which groups (if any) it will compare. Its meta-theoretical
commitments (B7) are likely related to limiting research to those things
that can be measured. The narrow use of the capability approach will
most likely not have much to say about agency (B4) and structural
constraints (B5) but adopt the implicit theories of agency and structural
constraints that are used in the empirical literatures on interpersonal
comparisons. Finally, the narrower view must decide on how to weigh
the dimensions (module C2) and which methods for empirical analysis
(module C3) to make.
In its broad uses, the capability approach not only evaluates the
lives of individuals (as in the narrow use), but also includes other

86

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

considerations in its evaluations, which are ‘borrowed’ from other
approaches or theories. For example, the broader use of the capability
approach often pays attention to other normative considerations
and other values than only wellbeing, such as efficiency, agency, or
procedural fairness.
The broad view would, in most cases, have a more ambitious purpose
for its use of the capability approach, such as societal evaluation or policy
design. It would also have (either implicit or explicit) richer theories
of human diversity, agency and structural constraints, and — most
importantly — add several additional ontological and explanatory
theories (module C1) and additional normative principles (module C4).
The narrow view does not include modules C1 and C4, and this can
make a huge difference to the kind of capability theory that emerges.
An example of the broad view is David Crocker’s (2008) book on
development ethics, in which he has extended the capability approach
with accounts of agency, democratic deliberation and participation
into a more detailed account of development ethics. Yet Crocker
acknowledges that not all versions of the capability approach embrace
agency so explicitly. The capability approach proper need not endorse
a strong account of agency, but there are several scholars who have
developed particular capability theories and applications in which
agency plays a central role (e.g. Claassen and Düwell 2013; Claassen
2016; Trommlerová, Klasen and Leßmann 2015).
Why is this difference between the narrow and the broad uses of
the capability approach relevant and important? There are several
important reasons. First, to assess a critique of the capability approach,
we need to know whether the critique addresses the capability approach
in its narrow use, or rather a specific version of its broad use. Second, we
need to be clear that many of the additional normative commitments in
the broad use of the capability approach are not essential to the capability
approach: rather, they are optional choices made in modules B and,
especially, module C1 (additional ontological and explanatory theories)
and module C4 (additional normative principles and concerns). This
insight will also be important when we address the question, in section
4.9, of whether we can simply talk about ‘the capability approach’ and
‘the human development paradigm’ as the same thing.

2.14 Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter has been to give a comprehensive
explanation of the capability approach: what is it trying to do, what
are the many ways in which it has been used, what are the properties
that all capability theories share, and what is the structure that we can
detect in the construction of capability theories and applications? In
order to get a helicopter view, I have deliberately put aside a number
of additional distinctions and details. They will be the focus of the next
chapter, whereas critiques and areas of contestation and debate will be
discussed in chapter 4.

3.1 Introduction
This chapter aims to deepen our understanding of the capability
approach, by analysing and clarifying a range of questions that a
student of the capability approach may have. My aim has been to
include the most frequently asked questions raised by students of
the capability approach, as well as a few cases which, in my view,
currently lead to confusion in the literature. The questions and issues
which are much more a matter of debate or contestation have been
collected in chapter 4. Admittedly, the distinction between questions
that require clarification on the one hand, and issues of debate on the
other, is not a neat one. But that should not bother us: nothing much
hangs on whether a topic is included in chapter 3 or rather in chapter
4; what matters is that students of the capability approach are able to
find answers to the questions they have.
In this chapter, the following topics are clarified and analysed:
How do the terminologies used by Sen and Nussbaum differ, and
which additional terminological refinements have been proposed in
the literature? (Section 3.2) Can ‘capabilities’ properly be described
as freedom, and if so, which types of freedom are capabilities? And
is it always a good idea to speak of capabilities in terms of freedom?
(Section 3.3) Which considerations should play a role in making the
relevant choices in module B6 — the choice between functionings or
capabilities (or both) — for one’s capability theory? (Section 3.4) How
exactly does the capability approach account for human diversity, and

why is human diversity given so much importance in the capability
literature? (Section 3.5) What does the notion ‘collective capability’ refer
to? (Section 3.6) Which notion of wellbeing does the capability approach
give us? (Section 3.7) How does the capability approach differ from the
happiness approach, and what are the reasons that capability scholars do
not adopt the happiness approach? (Section 3.8) To what extent — and
how — can the capability approach deal with adaptive preferences?
(Section 3.9) Can a capability theory also be an explanatory theory, or is
that not possible? (Section 3.10) Can the capability approach be used to
study all normative questions, or is it not a suitable framework for some
normative questions? (Section 3.11) The capability approach is often
positioned as an alternative for resourcist theories — but what exactly
is the role of resources in the capability approach? (Section 3.12) Finally,
we consider how the capability approach relates to two established
literatures: theories of justice and theories of human rights. Which
choices in module B and module C are needed in order to construct a
capability theory of justice? (Section 3.13) And how do capabilities and
human rights relate to each other? (Section 3.14)

3.2 Refining the notions of ‘capability’
and ‘functioning’
While at a very introductory level, the terms ‘functionings’ and
‘capability’ seem to be easy and straightforward, the terminology
used in the literature is, alas, not always clear. There has been quite
considerable confusion in the use of the terminology, although — if one
takes a meta-disciplinary helicopter view — it is possible to discern that
particular uses of certain terms are more dominant than others. The
confusion has several sources. First, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum
have used the same terminology somewhat differently to each other,
and since most capability scholars are more influenced either by Sen
or by Nussbaum, its use in the wider literature is not standardised.
Moreover, both Sen and Nussbaum have changed their use over time,
without always making this explicit. Thirdly, there are differences in
terminological choices that can be traced back to established differences
in different disciplines, which are having their effect on the different
disciplinary streams in the capability literature.

There are at least four terminological issues that need to be noted:
(1) ‘capability’ understood as a single opportunity versus ‘capability’
understood as an opportunity set; (2) Nussbaum’s more complex
terminology; (3) the quite different meanings given in the literature
to the term ‘basic capabilities’; and (4) additional refinements — both
some that have been proposed in the literature, as well as a proposal
that I will put on the table, namely to take the robustness of a capability
into account. Let’s look at these four issues in turn.

3.2.1 Capability as an opportunity versus
capability as an opportunity set
Let us first look at Sen’s original terminology. The major constituents
of the capability approach are functionings and capabilities. Functionings
are the ‘beings and doings’ of a person, whereas a person’s capability
is “the various combinations of functionings that a person can achieve.
Capability is thus a set of combinations of functionings, reflecting the
person’s freedom to lead one type of life or another” (Sen 1992a, 40).
According to Sen, a person has only one capability (or capability set),
which consists of a combination of possible, reachable functionings.
A person’s functionings and her capability are closely related but
distinct, as the following quote illustrates:
A functioning is an achievement, whereas a capability is the ability
to achieve. Functionings are, in a sense, more directly related to
living conditions, since they are different aspects of living conditions.
Capabilities, in contrast, are notions of freedom, in the positive sense:
what real opportunities you have regarding the life you may lead. (Sen
1987, 36)

Sen thus used the term ‘a capability’ for what we could also call ‘a
capability set’. The advantage of each person corresponds to one
capability (hence ‘a person’s overall freedom to do the things they want
to do and be the person they want to be’). In the original terminology,
each person had one capability, and the use of the word ‘capabilities’
therefore had to refer to the capabilities of various persons.
In Sen’s original terminology, a person’s capability consisted of a
range of potential functionings, out of which a particular combination
of functionings could be chosen. Functionings could therefore be either

92

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

potential or achieved. This kind of language is most familiar to social
choice scholars and scholars in formal welfare economics, where the
focus of much of the analysis is on the opportunity set.
However, many other scholars working on the capability paradigm,
including Martha Nussbaum, have labelled these potential functionings
‘capabilities’, and only use the term ‘functioning’ for an outcome. In
that terminology, the capability set consists of a number of capabilities,
in the same way as a person’s overall freedom is made up of a number
of more specific freedoms. One does not find this usage of ‘capabilities’
(meaning the separate elements of one person’s capability set) in Sen’s
earlier writings, and in his later writings he (perhaps reluctantly) uses
the word ‘capability’ in both senses interchangeably.
What, then, is the terminology that is now predominantly used? As
was explained in chapter 2, a functioning is a state of one’s being (such
as being healthy or ill), or something one is doing (such as going on
a trip or raising children). The real opportunity to accomplish such a
functioning, is the corresponding capability. Hence if my sister goes on
a trip and invites me along, but I decide to stay at home because I want
to do something else, then I have the capability to go on a trip, but I
chose not to have the corresponding outcome — the functioning. Each
functioning corresponds exactly to one capability.
This plural use of capabilities is widespread in the contemporary
literature on the capability approach — with the exception of those
working in social choice theory, formal welfare economics and related
fields. The terminology as used by the broader group of scholars
working on the capability approach seems to be more straightforward
and less technical, but when reading Sen’s (earlier) work it is important
to know that the term ‘capability’ started with a different definition.1

3.2.2 Nussbaum’s terminology
In Women and Human Development, her first book-length work on her
capabilities theory, Martha Nussbaum used the following terminology,
which she still uses in her recent book on the capability approach
(Nussbaum 2011, 20–25). Human capabilities are “what people are
1	For a seminal analysis of the differences between Nussbaum’s and Sen’s conceptual
and terminological apparatus, see the twin papers by David A. Crocker (1992, 1995).

3. Clarifications

93

actually able to do and to be” (Nussbaum 2000, 5). From those human
capabilities, Nussbaum identifies a list of ten “central capabilities” which
have the status of rights: they “may not be infringed upon to pursue
other types of social advantage” (Nussbaum 2000, 14). According to
Nussbaum’s minimal account of social justice, these central capabilities
have to be protected up to a certain threshold level.
Nussbaum helpfully distinguishes between three further notions to
unpack the concept of ‘human capabilities’: basic capabilities, internal
capabilities, and combined capabilities (Nussbaum 2000, 84–85). The
term basic capabilities refers to “the innate equipment of individuals that
is necessary for developing the more advanced capabilities”, such as
the capability of speech and language, which is present in a new-born
but needs to be fostered before it can develop into a true capability.
Internal capabilities are “the matured conditions of readiness” — the
internal aspect of the capability. If I have the skill and meet the physical
preconditions of walking, then I may or may not be able to go for a
walk — depending, for example, on whether as a woman I am legally
allowed to leave the house without a male relative, or whether there
is not currently a hurricane posing a real danger if I were to leave my
house. If those suitable external conditions are in place, we can speak of
combined capabilities.
Finally, a functioning is an “active realisation of one or more
capabilities. […] Functionings are beings and doings that are the
outgrowths or realizations of capabilities” (Nussbaum 2011, 25). Hence,
in Nussbaum’s terminology, a functioning stands in relation to a
capability as an outcome stands in relation to an opportunity.
While the substantive distinctions to which Nussbaum’s terminology
refers are very helpful, the specific words chosen may be not ideal.
There are two problems. First, for many capability scholars, the
reference to the term ‘capability’ refers to the real opportunity to do
something or be the person one wants to be; ‘internal capabilities’ do
not fit that category. They are, starting from that perspective, simply
not a capability, but rather necessary elements of a capability, or a
precondition for a capability. It would have been better to call ‘internal
capabilities’ simply ‘internal characteristics’ or else ‘skills, talents,
character traits and abilities’. Such terminology would also make the
link with various other behavioural and social disciplines much easier.

94

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

What Nussbaum calls ‘combined capabilities’ could then simply be
called ‘human capabilities’, which consist of the presence of those skills,
talents, character traits and abilities, together with suitable external
conditions and circumstances. Second, Nussbaum uses the term ‘basic
capability’ after it had already been used in two other different ways,
as the next section will show. Why not simply call these ‘innate human
characteristics’?

3.2.3 What are ‘basic capabilities’?
The way readers from different disciplines use terminology in particular
ways is clearly exemplified by the various interpretations of the term
‘basic capabilities’.
One interpretation is Nussbaum’s. As was mentioned before,
Nussbaum (2000, 84) uses the term ‘basic capabilities’ to refer to “the
innate equipment of individuals that is necessary for developing the
more advanced capabilities”, such as the capability of speech and
language, which is present in a new-born but needs to be fostered. Yet
of the four ways in which the term ‘basic capabilities’ is used in the
literature, this one may be the least prevalent.
Sen (1980) mentioned the term ‘basic capability’ as his first rough
attempt to answer the ‘equality of what?’ question, but changed his
terminology in subsequent work (what he called ‘basic capability’
would later become ‘capability’).2 In his later writings, Sen reserved
the term ‘basic capabilities’ to refer to a threshold level for the relevant
capabilities. A basic capability is “the ability to satisfy certain elementary
and crucially important functionings up to certain levels” (Sen 1992a, 45
fn 19). Basic capabilities refer to the freedom to do some basic things
considered necessary for survival and to avoid or escape poverty or
other serious deprivations. The relevance of basic capabilities is “not so
much in ranking living standards, but in deciding on a cut-off point for
the purpose of assessing poverty and deprivation” (Sen 1987, 109).

2	The ‘equality of what?’ debate was prompted by Sen’s Tanner lecture with the same
title (Sen 1980a), in which he argued that almost any theory of distributive justice is
egalitarian, in the sense that they all advocate equality of something. The question
to pose to a theory of distributive justice is therefore not whether it is egalitarian or
not, but what is its answer to the ‘equality of what?’ question.

3. Clarifications

95

A third way in which the term ‘basic capabilities’ can be used is,
as in analytical political philosophy, to refer to essential (moral and/
or political) entitlements that signify a higher level of moral urgency,
according to the philosopher’s own normative commitments. For
example, Rutger Claassen, who has been developing an agency-based
capability theory of justice, has been using the term ‘basic’ in that sense
(Claassen 2016).
A fourth way to use the term ‘basic capability’ has been proposed
by Bernard Williams. Yet this has, to the best of my knowledge, not
been taken up by anyone. Williams has argued that it is important to
distinguish between the capability to choose yet another new brand
of washing powder from, say, Adam Smith’s often-cited capability to
appear in public without shame. Williams rightly notes that “what you
need, in order to appear without shame in public, differs depending on
where you are, but there is an invariant capability here, namely that of
appearing in public without shame. This underlying capability is more
basic” (Williams 1987, 101). I agree with the need for the distinction that
Williams makes, but I would rather call these underlying capabilities
the general capabilities, so as to avoid confusion with Sen’s use of basic
capabilities. I will turn to the discussion of general versus specific
capabilities in section 3.2.4, but first I want to ask the question: how
should we interpret the term ‘basic capability’?
My reading is that, within the capability literature, the most
widespread (and hence dominant) use of ‘basic capabilities’ is Sen’s
use, referring to poverty or deprivation. Hence, while the notion
of capabilities refers to a very broad range of opportunities, ‘basic
capabilities’ refers to the real opportunity to avoid poverty or to meet
or exceed a threshold of wellbeing. By focusing on ‘basic’ capabilities,
we are limiting the set of all capabilities in two ways: first, by having a
selection of capabilities (i.e. those that are key to capturing wellbeing,
and those that are centrally important), and second, by imposing a
threshold at which those capabilities will be evaluated (i.e. at a low or
poverty-like level).
Basic capabilities are thus crucial for poverty analysis and in general
for studying the wellbeing of large sections of the population in poor
countries, or for theories of justice that endorse sufficiency as their
distributive rule. In affluent countries, by contrast, wellbeing analysis

96

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

often focuses on capabilities that are less necessary both for survival
and the avoidance of poverty. It is important to acknowledge that
the capability approach is not restricted to poverty and deprivation
analysis but can also serve as a framework for, say, project or policy
evaluations or inequality measurement in non-poor communities. Sen’s
and Nussbaum’s extensive writings on the capability approach in the
context of poverty alleviation and development questions have misled
some of their readers into thinking that the capability approach is about
poverty and development issues only. Yet as has been absolutely clear
from the description and account of the capability approach presented
in chapters 1 and 2, there is conceptually or normatively no reason to
restrict its scope in this way. The term ‘basic capabilities’ is helpful since
it can signal to the reader when the capability approach is specifically
used in this context.

3.2.4 Conceptual and terminological refinements
Over the years, several proposals have been made to refine the notions
of ‘functioning’ and ‘capability’, or to add additional qualifications
which may be helpful in capability analyses.
The first refinement — which is straightforward but still very
helpful — is the distinction between general and specific functionings and
capabilities (Alkire 2002, 31). Suppose we are concerned with questions
about what is needed for people not to be socially excluded. Sen has
repeatedly referred to Adam Smith’s example that, in order to be able to
appear in public without shame, one needed (in the time and place Smith
lived) a linen shirt. Yet in other countries one would need a sari, or a suit,
or something else. We all know that in every specific time and place,
there are certain types of clothes one shouldn’t wear if one doesn’t want
to be frowned upon or be seen as inappropriately dressed. We could
say that, for women in place A, being able to wear a sari is important,
and for men in another place, being able to wear a suit is important, in
order not to be excluded. ‘Being able to wear a sari’ and ‘being able to
wear a suit’ are specific capabilities; ‘being able to wear the clothes that
are considered appropriate’ is the more general capability. Thus, if we
formulate the relevant capabilities at a higher level of generality, it will
be easier to reach agreement on what those are, than if we focus on more

3. Clarifications



97

specific capabilities (Sen 1992a, 108–09). General capabilities are thus
the more generic and more abstract capabilities. The idea of general
versus more specific functionings and capabilities is also entailed by
Nussbaum’s idea of the multiple realisability of capabilities that are under
scrutiny: the selected capabilities “can be more concretely specified in
accordance with local beliefs and circumstances” (Nussbaum 2000, 77).
A second conceptual refinement to consider is the concept of ‘refined
functioning’. Sen (1987, 36–37) has proposed the concept of ‘refined
functioning’ to designate functioning that takes note of the available
alternatives. Sen (1992a, 52) notes: “‘fasting’ as a functioning is not just
starving; it is choosing to starve when one does have other options”. The aim
of this proposal is to try to bridge the choice between functionings and
capabilities by a conceptual move. That is, one could focus on achieved
functionings levels but — where appropriate — include the exercise of
choice as one of the relevant functionings (Fleurbaey 2002). This allows
us to stay within the realm of (observable) achievements, but because
the act of choosing is included, one can derive from that functioning
relevant information about whether one had options or not.
A third conceptual refinement — this time a qualification or property
that we can attribute to a functioning or a capability — has been proposed
by Avner De-Shalit and Jonathan Wolff. They have argued that what is
relevant for the most disadvantaged persons is not so much whether
they have any functionings, but rather whether those functionings are
secure (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 2013). The idea here is that we are
not only interested in the functionings that people can achieve, but also
in the prospects that a person has to sustain that level — that is, the
risk and vulnerability of losing that functionings achievement should
be taken into account, even if the risk never materialises. The objective
fact of risk and vulnerability itself should be seen as having an influence
on how we normatively judge a functionings achievement (Wolff and
De-Shalit 2007, 63–73).
Another qualification that we could add to capabilities is their
robustness — referring to the probability of a capability being realisable.
The standard definition of a capability is that it is a genuine option: if we
have the capability and we choose this opportunity, then we should also
enjoy the outcome — the functioning. But this presents us with a very
dichotomous view of our options: either we have an option with a 100%

98

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

probability, or else, if the probability is significantly less, it is implied
that we do not have the capability. That is, arguably, a rather unhelpful
way of thinking about real life processes. For example, the problem
with women’s opportunities in advanced economies is definitely not
that women have no capabilities to achieve professional success; rather,
the problem is that, given a variety of mechanisms that are biased
against female professionals, the robustness of the capabilities they are
given is weaker. If an equally talented man and woman both want to
succeed professionally, they may, in a liberal society, both have that
capability — but the probability that the man will be able to succeed will
be higher than the woman’s. She does have some opportunity, but that
opportunity is less robust. Probabilities of success if one were to want
to exercise that capability would be a way to express this. In the above
gender case, the source of the different probabilities lies in the social and
environmental conversion factors. But the source of the difference in
robustness could also lie in internal factors. For example, a person with
a psychiatric condition may have some opportunities for finding a job,
but those opportunities may be much more precarious then they would
be if she didn’t have those psychiatric challenges.

3.3 Are capabilities freedoms,
and if so, which ones?
Amartya Sen (1990c, 460) has described capabilities as
the freedom[s] to achieve valuable human functionings, which can vary
from such elementary things as being well-nourished and avoiding
escapable morbidity and mortality, to such complex achievements
as having self-respect, being well-integrated in society, and so on.
Capabilities thus reflect the actual freedoms that people respectively
enjoy in being able to lead the kind of lives they have reason to value.

But several philosophers and social scientists have questioned the
understanding (or, for philosophers: ‘conceptualisation’) of capabilities
in terms of freedoms, asking whether capabilities could plausibly be
understood as freedoms, whether Sen was not overextending the use
of freedom, whether freedom is all there is to the capability approach,
and whether it is wise to use the terminology of freedom for the goals

3. Clarifications



99

of the capability approach (e.g. Cohen 1993; Gasper and Van Staveren
2003; Hill 2003; Okin 2003, 291–92). Let us therefore clarify and analyse
the conceptualisation of capabilities as freedom by answering three
questions. First, capabilities have been described as positive freedoms,
but how should we understand that notion, and is that the best way to
describe what kind of freedoms capabilities are? (Section 3.3.1) Secondly,
is there a better conceptualisation of freedom that captures what
capabilities are? (Section 3.3.2) Thirdly, if it is the case that capabilities
can coherently be conceptualised as freedoms, are capabilities then
best understood as freedoms, or is it better to avoid that terminology?
(Section 3.3.3).

3.3.1 Capabilities as positive freedoms?
Sen has often used the distinction between positive and negative
freedoms, thereby describing capabilities as positive freedoms. For
example, Sen (1984b, 315) has stated that he is trying “to outline a
characterization of positive freedoms in the form of capabilities of
persons”.3 In some discourses, especially in the social sciences, the term
‘positive freedoms’ is used to refer to access to certain valuable goods,
such as the freedom to affordable high quality health care or education.
Positive freedoms are contrasted with negative freedoms, which refer
to the absence of interference by others, such as the freedom to own a
gun.4 Yet these are by no means standard understandings of positive
and negative freedom.
In making the claim that capabilities are positive freedoms, Sen
often approvingly refers to Isaiah Berlin’s canonical distinction between
positive and negative freedom, but unfortunately doesn’t explain in
detail how we should read Berlin. This is potentially confusing, since
Berlin’s use of the term ‘positive freedom’ is far from crystal clear.

3	Other statements equating capabilities with positive freedoms can be found in
Sen (1982, 6, 38–39; 1984c, 78, 86; 1985c, 201; 2008, 18 among other places). In his
1979 Tanner lecture in which Sen coined the term ‘capability’, he did not refer to
freedoms, but did use other terms such as ‘ability’ and ‘power’.
4	According to Sen (2009c, 282) this is the understanding of positive and negative
freedom in welfare economics.

100

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Let us start from the clearest concept in Berlin — his notion of
negative freedom — which Berlin (1969, 122) defines as follows: “I am
normally said to be free to the degree to which no man or body of men
interferes with my activity”. The opposite of having negative freedom is
being coerced — the deliberate interference of other persons in an area
of my life in which I could, without the interference, act freely. Negative
freedom thus corresponds to freedom as non-interference, and Berlin
speaks approvingly of this kind of freedom: “[…] non-interference,
which is the opposite of coercion, is good as such, although it is not
the only good. This is the ‘negative’ conception of liberty in its classical
form” (1969, 128).
On positive freedom, there is much less clarity in Berlin’s work.
Berlin first introduces positive freedom as the freedom to be one’s own
master:
I wish to be the instrument of my own, not of other men’s, acts of will. I
wish to be a subject, not an object; to be moved by reasons, by conscious
purposes, which are my own, not by causes which affect me, as it were,
from outside. I wish to be a somebody, not nobody, a doer — deciding,
not being decided for; self-directed and not acted upon by external nature
or by other men as if I were a thing, or an animal, or a slave incapable of
playing a human role, that is, conceiving goals and policies of my own
and realizing them. (Berlin 1969, 131)

Berlin argues that the metaphor of self-mastery historically developed
into the idea that a person has two selves, a dominant self which is
identified with reason and a ‘higher nature’, and a ‘heteronomous self’
which follows desires and passions and needs to be disciplined. Berlin
continues that the first self, the ‘real self’, may become seen as wider
than the individual,
as a social whole of which the individual is an element or aspect: a tribe, a
race, a church, a state, the great society of the living and the dead and the
yet unborn. This entity is then identified as being the ‘true’ self which,
by imposing its collective, or ‘organic’ single will upon its recalcitrant
‘members’ achieves its own, and therefore their ‘higher freedom’. (Berlin
1969, 132)

Put differently, men are “coerced in the name of some goal (let us
say, justice or public health) which they would if they were more
enlightened, themselves pursue, but do not, because they are blind or

ignorant or corrupt” (132–133). Berlin acknowledges that one could, in
principle, develop the same justification of tyranny starting from the
definition of negative freedom, but continues to argue that this is easier
with the positive conception of freedom. The reason is that the idea of
positive freedom as self-mastery entails a distinction between my ‘true’
self and an ‘untrue self’. It is therefore possible that someone else other
than you knows better what your true self is, which opens up a space
for another person to coerce you in the name of your ‘true self’. Berlin
believes that this has historically been the case with tyrannical regimes
that propagated an ideology entailing a notion of positive freedom as
self-mastery, whereby everything can be justified in the name of some
true or higher self that needs to master other impulses and desires.
It is not difficult to see that positive freedom in Berlin’s sense is not
the kind of freedom that capabilities represent, especially not when
understood against the historically tyrannical shape that this ideal
(according to Berlin) took. Capabilities are not about people’s internal
attitudes towards what they should do with their lives. At the political
level, the capability approach would advocate that we should organise
our political life in such a way as to expand people’s capabilities,
whereby the capability approach will judge that two persons had the
same initial equal freedom if both of them had the same initial set of
valuable options from which to choose. The capability approach,
therefore, is not strongly perfectionist and teleological, as is the positive
freedom doctrine in Berlin’s sense. In sum, capabilities are very different
from Berlin’s notion of positive freedom, and Berlin’s understanding of
positive freedom is not the best way to capture the kinds of freedom that
capabilities are.
In later work, Sen acknowledged the potential for confusion that
his equation of capabilities with positive freedom and his references to
Berlin’s work had made, and provided a clearer description of his own
understanding of positive freedom. In his Arrow lectures, Sen (2002a,
586) wrote:
positive freedom has also been variously defined, varying on one side
from the general freedom to achieve in general, to the particular aspect,
on the other side, of freedom to achieve insofar as it relates to influences
working within oneself (a use that is close to Berlin’s conceptualization of
positive freedom). In my own attempts in this field, I have found it more
useful to see ‘positive freedom’ as the person’s ability to do the things

102

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

in question taking everything into account (including external restraints as
well as internal limitations). In this interpretation, a violation of negative
freedom must also be — unless compensated by some other factor — a
violation of positive freedom, but not vice versa. This way of seeing
positive freedom is not the one preferred by Isaiah Berlin.

This quote also draws attention to another drawback of defining
capabilities in terms of positive freedom. Violations of negative freedoms
will, according to Sen, always lead to violations of positive freedoms; yet
for Berlin this need not be the case. In a totalitarian state which espouses
a doctrine of positive freedom, in which the state will help the citizens
to ‘liberate their true selves’, a violation of a range of negative freedoms,
such as the freedom of expression or of the freedom to hold property,
will not violate positive freedom; on the contrary, within the parameters
of that doctrine, violations of such negative freedoms may even enhance
the state-aspired positive freedom.
So where does all this terminological exegesis lead us? It has often
been remarked that there are many available definitions of negative
and positive freedom. Berlin’s conceptualisations are canonical, but his
definition of positive freedom is very different from Sen’s. Moreover, as
Charles Taylor (1979, 175) rightly pointed out, the debate on negative and
positive freedoms has been prone to polemical attacks that caricature
the views of both sides. One therefore wonders what is to be gained by
describing capabilities in terms of positive freedoms — at least, if one
is aware of the philosophical background to this term. Perhaps it may
be wiser to look further for an alternative conceptualisation that is less
prone to creating misunderstandings?

3.3.2 Capabilities as opportunity or option freedoms?
Luckily, in other parts of Amartya Sen’s writings we can find the
answer to the question of what kind of freedoms capabilities are (if any
at all). Although Sen’s first descriptions of capabilities were couched
exclusively in terms of positive freedoms, he soon offered an alternative
description in terms of opportunities.5 In his 1984 Dewey Lectures, Sen
5	In fact, even this is not entirely correct, since in his earlier work and especially in
his work written for economists, Sen did not speak of ‘capabilities’, but rather of
‘capability sets’ and thus also of ‘opportunity sets’ (see section 3.2.1).

3. Clarifications

103

(1985c, 201) defended a conceptualisation of wellbeing freedom in terms
of capabilities, and defined wellbeing freedom as:
whether one person did have the opportunity of achieving the functioning
vector that another actually achieved. This involves comparisons of
actual opportunities that different persons have.

Similarly, in Inequality Reexamined, Sen (1992a, 31) writes:
A person’s position in a social arrangement can be judged in two different
perspectives, viz. (1) the actual achievement, and (2) the freedom to
achieve. Achievement is concerned with what we manage to accomplish,
and freedom with the real opportunity that we have to accomplish what
we value.

Given Sen’s descriptions of the freedoms that the capability approach is
concerned with in terms of opportunities, it seems a natural suggestion
to investigate whether the concept of ‘opportunity freedom’ better
captures the nature of capabilities.
Charles Taylor, in his discussion of Berlin’s distinction between
negative and positive freedom, has argued that beneath the distinction
between positive and negative freedom lies another set of distinctions,
namely between an exercise concept of freedom and an opportunity
concept of freedom. The exercise concept of freedom refers to an agent
being free “only to the extent that one has effectively determined
oneself and the shape of one’s life”, whereas according to the opportunity
concept of freedom “being free is a matter of what we can do, of what
is open to us to do, whether or not we do anything to exercise these
options” (Taylor 1979, 177). According to Taylor, theories of negative
freedom can be grounded on either an exercise or an opportunity
concept, but theories of positive freedom can never be grounded
merely on an opportunity concept. Taylor’s goal is arguing in favour
of the exercise concept of freedom, and shows that the crude view of
negative freedom (which, he argues, Berlin is defending) is untenable.
Taylor (1979, 177) describes the opportunity concept of freedom thus:
“being free is a matter of what we can do, of what it is open to us to do,
whether or not we do anything to exercise these options. […] Freedom
consists just in there being no obstacle. It is a sufficient condition of
one’s being free that nothing stand in the way”.

104

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Is Taylor’s opportunity concept of freedom the kind of freedom we
are searching for in our attempt to understand the nature of capabilities?
His concept comes close, but it is narrower than the conception of
freedom contained in the idea of capabilities. For Taylor, only external
obstacles count in the definition of negative freedom (Taylor 1979,
176, 193; Kukathas 2007, 688). He holds that the acknowledgement of
internal obstacles to action, including the action to choose between
different opportunities, merges an element of the exercise concept of
freedom into the opportunity concept. The notion of opportunity in
Taylor’s concept of opportunity freedom thus resembles a formal notion
of opportunity more closely than a substantive notion.
Here’s an example to illustrate the difference between Taylor’s
opportunity concept of freedom and the notion of ‘capabilities’. If, in
a patriarchal community, men have all the power, and in a verbally
aggressive manner they teach girls and remind women that their place
is inside the house, then surely these women do not have the same
opportunity freedom to find employment in the nearest city where
women from more liberal communities are holding jobs. In formal
terms, the women from both communities may be able to work outside
the home since there are jobs available to women in the city, they are
able-bodied and are able to commute to the city. Yet the women from the
patriarchal community would face much bigger costs and would need
to gather much more courage, and resist the subtle working of social
norms, before they could effectively access this formal opportunity. Put
in capability terms, we would say that the first group of women has
a much smaller capability to work outside the home than the women
living in less patriarchal communities. If the costs and burdens borne
by the women from strongly patriarchal communities are excessive, we
could even conclude that the capability to work in the city is virtually
nonexistent.
Luckily, more recent debates in political philosophy have further
developed this discussion, in a way that is helpful in answering the
question of how capabilities should be understood. Philip Pettit (2003)
has argued that the philosophical debate on social freedom could
benefit from being clear on the distinction between option-freedom
and agency-freedom. While option-freedom is a property of options,

3. Clarifications



105

agency-freedom is a property of agents. Agency-freedom relates to the
long tradition in philosophy of seeing the slave as the prime example of
someone who is not free: he is subjugated to the will of others. Agencyfreedom focusses on the question of how a person relates to their fellows,
and is a matter of social standing or status, not of the options that they
enjoy (Pettit 2003, 394–95).
Options are the alternatives that an agent is in a position to realize.
Pettit argues that option freedom is a function of two aspects: the
character of access to options, and the character of options themselves.
First, option freedom is a function of the character of the agent’s access to
the options. Some philosophers would hold that the physical possibility
of carrying out an option is sufficient for access, and thus would conclude
that the agent has option freedom. Alternatively, one could defend the
position that access to an option does not only depend on the physical
possibility of carrying out the option, but that non-physical barriers
are relevant too. Pettit distinguishes two possibilities: either an agent is
objectively more burdened than another agent when trying to access an
option, whether by difficulty or by penalty, or an agent is subjectively
burdened in the sense that he believes that access to an option is not
possible. The second aspect of option freedom is the character of the
options. Here a wide range of views exist, such as the number of options
that are accessible, their diversity, and whether they are objectively
significant or subjectively significant (Pettit 2003, 389–92).
Capabilities are precisely this kind of option freedom. What counts
in the capability approach is indeed the access that a person has to a
wide range of valuable alternative options. In sum, capabilities can be
understood as opportunity or option freedoms, but are broader than
Taylor’s rather narrow opportunity concept of freedom. We can therefore
conclude that it is conceptually sound to understand capabilities as
freedoms of this sort.6

6	It doesn’t follow, of course, that capability theories would not be able to pay attention
to agency freedom. They do — for example by including relational capabilities in
the selection of relevant dimensions, or by having some ideal of agency freedom as
an additional moral principle included in module C4.

106

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

3.3.3 Are capabilities best understood as freedoms?
The detailed analysis in the previous section doesn’t settle all questions,
though. It may well be the case that it is coherent to see capabilities as
freedoms, but that there is another notion, such as human rights, basic
needs, or something similar, that much better captures what capabilities
are.
The answer to that question has to be contextual in the following
sense. The capability approach is a deeply interdisciplinary approach,
yet scholars from different disciplines will have different associations
with certain terms. Philosophers may well have very different
associations with the word ‘freedom’ than, say, anthropologists or
development sociologists. Similar remarks can be made when the
capability approach is being applied for policy and political purposes,
since the term ‘freedom’ has in some countries a particular historical
connotation, or is being claimed by extreme right or extreme left political
parties, in the sense that if they were to come to power, they would
use that power to drastically curtail the capabilities of (some sections
of) the population. However, one should also not forget that the word
‘capabilities’ is non-existent in many languages, and may itself also lead
to mistaken connotations, for example with skills or capacities in its
French translation (capacité).
When developing a particular capability theory or capability
application, should we frame the capability approach in terms of
freedoms? My suggestion would be to answer this question in a
pragmatic fashion. If the context in which the capability approach is
applied makes it likely that the use of the term freedom will lead to the
application being misunderstood, then I would suggest that one defines,
describes and illustrates the word ‘capabilities’ and introduces that
term. Yet for moral philosophers and political theorists who are eager to
further develop the capability approach into a coherent political theory,
a clear understanding of capabilities as option freedoms may pave the
way for work that lies ahead. Pettit’s analysis of option freedoms, and
the established literature to which he is referring in his analysis, give
the capability scholar a neat overview of the choices that need to be
made if one wants to turn the underspecified capability approach into
a well-specified moral or political capability theory. For the political

3. Clarifications



107

philosopher, there is therefore less reason to be worried about being
misunderstood when referring to capabilities as option freedoms, or as
opportunity freedoms.

3.4 Functionings or capabilities?
We now move to examine the issue that is central to module B6: should
we, when developing a capability analysis or capability theory, focus on
functionings, capabilities, or a mixture of both? After all, this question
is not settled. It is one of the core features of the capability approach
that it uses ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’ as core notions (property
A1, as discussed in 2.6.1) and that every capability analysis endorses
the claim that functionings and/or capabilities form the evaluative space
(property A5, as discussed in 2.6.5). But this still leaves the question
unanswered whether we should focus on functionings, or on capabilities
or on a combination of functionings and capabilities. Perhaps we have
good reasons sometimes to focus on functionings, and sometimes
on capabilities, for example for different types of applications, or for
different groups of people?
Luckily, this question is not new to the capability literature, and
there is by now a lively debate with many different types of arguments
about whether the appropriate wellbeing metric should be capabilities
or functionings, hence opportunities or achievements. What reasons or
considerations have been argued to be relevant for this choice?7
The first consideration concerns anti-paternalism. It is a normative
consideration: by focusing on capabilities rather than functionings, we
do not force people into a particular account of good lives but instead
aim at a range of possible ways of life from which each person can
choose. Thus, it is the liberal nature of the capability approach, or an
anti-paternalist commitment, that motivates a principled choice of
capabilities rather than functionings. Obviously, the strength of this
argument depends on how bad one takes paternalism to be. There may
be good reasons to believe that some paternalism is unavoidable, or
even desired (Nussbaum 2000, 51–56; Robeyns 2016b). Moreover, some
7	
General discussions surveying different reasons to choose for functionings,
capabilities or both, can also be found in Robeyns and Van der Veen (2007, 45–99,
76–78), Hick and Burchardt (2016, 79–82) and Robeyns (2016b).

108

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

scholars have argued that some element of paternalism in the capability
approach may well be unavoidable. One reason is that the protection
of the capacity to choose from one’s capability set requires certain
functionings, such as mental health and education, to be promoted as
achievements, rather than merely as freedoms (Gandjour 2008). Another
reason is that the protection of certain specific capabilities requires
either previously certain functionings-levels, or else requires certain
levels of achievement of other capabilities, or requires that enough other
people have functionings achievements within those capabilities (e.g.
Robeyns and Van der Veen 2007; Claassen 2014; Robeyns 2016b). Rutger
Claassen has identified five different types of mechanisms in which
capability protection leads to the promotion of functionings, and has
concluded that “any capability theory will have to confront the issue of
paternalism” (Claassen 2014, 72).
As this literature shows, there are many reasons why one can
reasonably decide sometimes to promote functionings, rather than
capabilities. Here, I will only give one example, namely limits to our
capacities to make informed choices in a voluntary, autonomous
way. Let us start with an uncontested case: infants and the severely
cognitively disabled. The concept of functioning has particular relevance
for our relations to those human beings who are not yet able to choose
(infants), who will never be able to make complex choices (severely
mentally disabled individuals), or who have lost this ability through
advanced dementia or serious brain damage. Whether or not these
persons can decide to be well nourished and healthy, it is generally
held that we (through families, governments, or other institutions)
have the moral obligation to promote or protect their nutritional and
healthy functioning. All capability theorists agree that in these cases,
we should focus on functionings rather than capabilities. The implicit
underlying assumption in the claim that capabilities have normative
priority over functionings is that we assume the presence of a sufficient
level of agency in the individuals who will be given the power to make
their own choices from their capability sets. If we have strong reason
to believe that such agency cannot be attributed to a person, we should
not let the person herself decide on which options to choose; however,
we should find ways of compensating for that lack of agency — either
by having a steward make the choices for her or by guiding her in the

3. Clarifications



109

choice-making process. Thus, we will shift our normative concern from
capabilities to functionings for those who are incapable of deciding for
themselves. In empirical research, this implies, for example, that it is
fine to study the quality of life of small children by focussing on a range
of functionings (e.g. Phipps 2002).
But the paternalism claim is not limited to the case of infants and the
severely cognitively disabled: one could also apply this argument — at
least to some extent and in some areas — to all adults. Adults, too, often
make systematically irrational or mistaken choices. We are often not
able to choose what is best for us simply because of our psychological
makeup; many of our choices are the result of the impulsive, unreflective,
habit-driven part of our brain rather than the deliberative and reflective
part. There is mounting empirical evidence of our systematic failures in
choice-making, that we are influenced by a large number of arbitrary
factors in making choices and that we often harm our own interests in
non-deliberate and non-intentional ways (e.g. Ariely 2010; Kahneman
2011). It is entirely consistent for a capability theory to argue that we
have strong reasons to protect people against their own systematic
irrationalities, just as it is consistent for the capability approach to argue
that there are stronger reasons why we should allow people to make
the errors that follow from their own systematic irrationalities: both
positions follow from choices made in the B-modules.
Summing up, we have here a first normative consideration that can
help us to decide whether some (limited or fuller) focus on functionings
rather than capabilities is acceptable, namely the question of whether
there are mechanisms that justify paternalism.
A second normative consideration in the choice between capabilities
and functionings stems from the importance given to personal
responsibility in contemporary political philosophy. If one believes that
the moral aim should be to establish equality of opportunity, then it
follows that one should, at least as an ideal, favour equality of capability
over equality of functionings. If equality of capability becomes the ideal,
then each person should have the same real opportunity (capability),
but once that is in place, each individual should be held responsible
for his or her own choices. It is important to stress, however, that
philosophers and social scientists working on issues of social justice
do not at all agree on whether equality of opportunity (capabilities)

110

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

should be the goal, rather than equality of outcome (functionings). On
the one hand, the responsibility-sensitivity principle is widely endorsed
not only in political philosophy but also in the mathematical models
being developed in normative welfare economics. If one wants to
endorse and implement this principle of responsibility-sensitivity, then
specifications and applications of the capability approach should focus
on capabilities, rather than functionings. On the other hand, scholars
have objected to the weight given to personal responsibility, both within
the highly abstract theorising about ideals and when considering more
applied and practical issues. At a highly abstract theoretical level,
philosophers disagree on whether we should endorse responsibilitysensitivity in developing the capability approach (Fleurbaey 2002;
Vallentyne 2005; Wolff and De-Shalit 2007). Moreover, for applied
work, serious epistemological hurdles may ultimately lead us to drop
the responsibility-sensitivity principle for practical reasoning about
the actual world: in practice, it is often impossible to know what the
causal factors were that led someone to make decisions that lowered
her achieved wellbeing, and hence it is difficult or even impossible to
know whether the causal factors are those for which one could be held
morally responsible or not.
Thirdly, there may be institutional considerations that have an influence
on whether we choose functionings, capabilities, or a mixture (Robeyns
2016b). Take the example of a government that has, with the broad
support of the population, set up a welfare state arrangement, which
includes certain welfare rights. Then this government may demand
from citizens who want to be part of this societal arrangement that they
proactively aim to master, secure, or maintain certain functionings,
such as being able to read and write, or to speak a language that does
not exclude one from holding a job. A welfare state arrangement that
offers citizens relatively generous welfare rights can legitimately induce
or perhaps even force citizens and legal residents to choose certain
functionings that are needed in order to justly participate in that welfare
state arrangement. But here, again, one has to pay attention to detail and
be careful, since we would want to distinguish between those who didn’t
exercise a functioning but had the capability versus those who didn’t
exercise a functioning but due to inability didn’t have the capability in
the first place. For example, if the political community believes that it is

3. Clarifications



111

a fair requirement in order to enjoy the benefits of the welfare state that
one learns the major dominant local language, then we have to make a
distinction between those who do, those who don’t but could, and those
who don’t but are unable. In practice, that distinction may sometimes
be very hard to make. Nevertheless, the general point to take home is
that an outcome-oriented theory of justice needs to be bolstered with an
account of what justice requires from the institutional design for a state
or coalition of states. Reasons of reciprocity, feasibility, and stability
may justify a focus on functionings rather than merely on capabilities.
Fourthly, there are pervasive cases of interdependence between
people’s capabilities that may prompt us to look beyond the capability of
a single person. One important type of case is that in which a capability
is available to a person but only if other people do not also want to realize
that capability (Basu 1987, 74). For example, two spouses may each have
the capability of holding demanding jobs which are each incompatible
with large caring responsibilities. However, if these spouses also have
infants or relatives with extensive care needs, then at best only one of
them may effectively realize that capability. Another type of case is that
in which the capability of one person is only possible if enough other
people have chosen to realise the corresponding functioning (Claassen
2014, 67–68). Take the example of being protected against dangerous
infectious diseases such as polio or measles by way of a vaccine. In order
genuinely to have that capability, one does not only need access to a
vaccination, but enough other people need to choose to be vaccinated,
since protection requires that a certain minimal number of people are
vaccinated. In other words, my child’s capability to be protected from
the debilitating effects of polio or the measles depends on your choice to
exercise that capability and opt for the functioning — that is, to vaccinate
your children.
Since capability sets may thus include freedoms that are conditional
(because they depend on the choices of other people), it might be better
to focus both on the individual’s capability set and also on what people
have been able to realize from their own capability sets, that is, their
functionings or wellbeing achievements. The question of who decides
or should decide this sort of question highlights the importance of
agency and procedural fairness, which are often additional normative
commitments included in the capability theory that is developed.

112

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Finally, note that in many empirical applications, an analysis of
functionings is used as a proxy for an analysis of the capability set. In the
case of comparison of inequalities between groups, it has been argued
that group-inequalities in functionings should be taken to reflect groupinequalities in capabilities, except if a plausible reason can be offered
for why the members of those groups would systematically choose
differently (Robeyns 2003; Kuklys and Robeyns 2005). Tania Burchardt
and Rod Hicks have stressed that if inferences about capabilities based
on information about functionings are made, one should be explicit
about the underlying assumptions, and that three different situations
could occur, namely:
(1) situations in which all difference in outcomes might reasonably
be attributed to differences in capabilities (such as where a person is
assaulted); (2) situations where differences in preferences may result in
differences in outcomes, but where for the purposes of public policy it
may be possible to assume that any differences are a result of differing
levels of capabilities; and (3) situations in which additional evidence
may be needed in order to determine whether differences in outcomes
are genuinely a result of differences in capability. (Hick and Burchardt
2016, 80)

What is the upshot of all these considerations? In my view, there are
sound reasons why one would limit oneself to capabilities, there are
sound reasons why one would rather focus only on functionings, and
there are sound reasons why one would prefer a mixture. The choice
depends on the purpose of the capability theory, but also on the
additional ontological choices one endorses (e.g. one’s idea of human
nature — are we fully rational or not, and what, if anything, should be
the consequences for policy making and institutional design), on the
normative principles one adds to the core of the capability approach
when developing a capability theory (e.g. endorsement of neutrality or
not), and on practical constraints one is facing. We cannot say in general
that the capability approach should focus exclusively on capabilities,
or exclusively on functionings. It all depends on additional theoretical
choices and normative commitments, which can be made in modules B
and C, when developing a capability analysis.8
8	I therefore think that Nussbaum’s (2011c) claim that it is a core property of the
capability approach that it focusses on capabilities rather than functionings is
mistaken (Robeyns 2011, 2016b; see also Claassen 2014).

3.5 Human diversity in the capability approach
In the previous chapter, it was already highlighted that diversity among
human beings is a key motivation as well as a conceptual characteristic
of the capability approach (module B3). Given how central human
diversity is to the approach, it is worth saying a few more words on this
topic. There are two important points to make: first, the mechanisms that
the capability approach has at its disposal to account for diversity, and
second, the attention given to diversity within the existing capability
literature.
The capability approach takes account of human diversity in at
least two ways. First, by its focus on the plurality of functionings and
capabilities as important evaluative spaces. By including a wide range
of dimensions in the conceptualization of wellbeing and wellbeing
outcomes, the approach broadens the so-called ‘informational basis’
of assessments, and thereby includes some dimensions that may
be particularly important for some groups but less so for others. For
example, in standard outcome assessments, women as a group virtually
always end up being worse off than men. But if the selection of outcome
dimensions is shifted to also include the quality and quantity of social
relations and support, and being able to engage in hands-on care, then
the normative assessment of gender inequality becomes less univocal
and requires much further argument and normative analysis, including
being explicit about how to aggregate different dimensions (Robeyns
2003, 2006a).
Secondly, human diversity is stressed in the capability approach by
the explicit focus on personal and socio-environmental conversion factors
that make possible the conversion of commodities and other resources
into functionings, and on the social, institutional, and environmental
contexts that affect the conversion factors and the capability set directly.
Each individual has a unique profile of conversion factors, some of
which are body-related, while others are shared with all people from her
community, and still others are shared with people with the same social
characteristics (e.g. same gender, class, caste, age, or race characteristics).
In the account of the capability approach presented in chapter 2, this
is made very explicit by having module A3 focus on the conversion
factors, which is an important source of interpersonal variations (the
other source is how structural constraints affect people differently). As

114

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Sen (1992a, xi) has argued, interpersonal variations should be of central
importance to inequality analysis:
Investigations of equality — theoretical as well as practical — that
proceed with the assumption of antecedent uniformity (including the
presumption that ‘all men are created equal’) thus miss out on a major
aspect of the problem. Human diversity is no secondary complication (to
be ignored, or to be introduced ‘later on’); it is a fundamental aspect of
our interest in equality.

Indeed, if human beings were not diverse, then inequality in one space,
say income, would more or less be identical with inequality in another
space, like capabilities. The entire question of what the appropriate
evaluative space should be would become obsolete if there weren’t
any interpersonal difference in the mapping of outcomes in one space
onto another. If people were all the same and had the same needs and
abilities, then the capability approach would lose much of its force
and significance, since resources would be excellent proxies for our
wellbeing and wellbeing freedom. But as it happens, human beings are
very diverse.
However, we also need to acknowledge that there is significant
scholarly dispute about the question of which dimensions and
parameters of human diversity are salient, and which are not. Scholars
embrace very different accounts of human diversity, which is why
we have module B3 in the capability approach. One’s account of
human diversity can often be traced back to the ontological accounts
one accepts of diversity-related factors, as well as the role of groups
in explanatory accounts. An example of the former is the account of
gender and race that one embraces. If one holds a theory of gender and
race that regards these as rather superficial phenomena that do not
have an important impact on people’s behaviour and opportunities in
life, then the attention given to diversity in a capability application or
capability theory will be rather minimal. This is logically consistent with
the structure of capability theories (as laid out in chapter 2), but it is also
a view that has not been widely embraced in the capability literature.
Instead, the capability approach attracts scholars who endorse accounts
of dimensions of gender, race, and other dimensions of human diversity
that are much richer. Presumably, these scholars recognise the ways in
which the capability approach can account for human diversity, hence

3. Clarifications



115

this may explain why most capability scholars endorse rich accounts of
such diversity.
A strong acknowledgement of human diversity has therefore become
a hallmark of the capability approach as that literature has developed.
Its criticism of other normative approaches is often fuelled by, and based
on, the claim that human diversity is insufficiently acknowledged in
many normative frameworks and theories. This also explains why the
capability approach is often favourably regarded by feminist scholars,
and by academics concerned with global justice, race or class relations, or
care and disability issues. One of the main complaints of these scholars
about mainstream philosophy and economics has been precisely this
issue: the relative invisibility of the fate of those people whose lives do
not correspond to that of an able-bodied, non-dependent, caregivingfree individual who belongs to the dominant ethnic, racial and religious
groups.

3.6 Collective capabilities
Several scholars have proposed the introduction of a category of
‘collective capabilities’ or ‘community capabilities’ (Evans 2002; Ibrahim
2006, 2009, 2017; Schlosberg and Carruthers 2010; Murphy 2014). The
idea of ‘collective capabilities’ is used in different ways in the literature,
and not always spelled out very carefully. I will try to reconstruct what
‘collective capabilities’ could mean, and then discuss to what extent
these are different from human capabilities tout court.
It is instructive, first, to see in which contexts different authors
introduce the idea of ‘collective capability’. Here are a few typical
examples from the literature. Solava Ibrahim (2006, 2009, 2017) argues
for the importance of collective capabilities from the perspective of the
work done by self-help groups of poor people fighting to overcome
their poverty, which is an issue also discussed by Stewart (2005).9 David
Schlosberg and David Carruthers (2010) argue for the importance of the
idea of collective capabilities to understand the struggles of indigenous
peoples for ecological justice. And Michael Murphy (2014) argues
9	Self-help groups are “any informal income-generating or social activity initiated
by a poor community to achieve permanent improvements in their individual and
communal wellbeings” (Ibrahim 2006, 398–399).

116

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

that political self-determination (of an indigenous group) should be
considered to be a collective capability which should be a central aim
for development.
What is shared in those cases, and what makes the idea of ‘collective
capability’ plausible, is that a group or collective is needed to engage in
collective action in order to reach the capability that the members of that
group find valuable.
Sen (2002b) points out that we should be careful not to confuse
this with a capability that he calls “socially dependent individual
capability” — a person’s capability, which that person enjoys, but
for which the person is dependent on others to have that capability
realised. Perhaps we should not use the term ‘individual capability’
but rather ‘personal capability’, since for many defenders of ‘collective
capabilities’ the word ‘individual’ evokes pejorative images of persons
living by themselves on an island. There are no such human creatures;
we all live interdependently, and none of us could grow up without
prolonged care from others, or, as adults, have a decent chance of
surviving and living a minimally adequate life. Human beings are, just
as other mammals, animals who live in groups. Although philosophers
are used to working with terms outside their everyday use, and most
philosophers (especially those with an analytical background) will not
have these pejorative connotations when they hear the term ‘individual
capabilities’, I will proceed with the term ‘personal capabilities’ in order
to facilitate the discussion in this section.
Now, if we are very strict in our terminological distinctions, then
collective capabilities are also personal capabilities, since it is individual
persons who enjoy the capabilities that are thus secured. Still, there are
two justifications to proceed with the term ‘collective capability’ — one
fundamental one, and one additional one which is especially weighty
from a practical point of view.
The fundamental reason to keep and use the term ‘collective
capability’ is that we may want to make a distinction between capabilities
that are only realisable with the help of others, versus capabilities that
require a group or collective to act in order to secure a capability for the
members of that group. An example of the former would be learning a
foreign language. It is impossible to do that without the help of others;
one needs a teacher, or at the very least books and audio-tapes or
internet lessons that help one with self-study. Still, that doesn’t suffice

3. Clarifications



117

to say that learning a language is a collective capability. There is no
group involved, and no collective action of that group is necessary in
order to achieve the functioning. A different case is acquiring the
capability to vote in elections for groups that are not yet given suffrage.
Fighting for that capability is not possible on one’s own. One needs
collective action — e.g. the first wave women’s movement, or the civil
rights movement in the US, or the anti-apartheid movement in South
Africa — to act collectively so that the group is granted the capability,
and all persons who belong to that group can enjoy the newly won
freedom.
The second reason to accept the notion of ‘collective capability’ is
because it is already present in the practice of certain justice movements,
whose demands fit very well with the capability approach, for example
because they embody claims of diversity or because they fight for a
notion of the good life or of justice that goes beyond a narrow materialist
or economistic view of what is valuable. Examples include the disability
movement, the women’s movement and indigenous struggles.
So the idea of a collective capability can be understood and can be
justified. Nevertheless, two warnings are in order, which may be needed
to avoid conceptual confusion as well as an overuse or inflation of the
notion. The first comment is that all that has been said so far does not
permit one to conclude that one has personal (individual) capabilities
and collective capabilities as two mutually exclusive categories. Rather,
collective capabilities are a subset of personal capabilities, namely
those personal capabilities that require for their realisation action by a
group or a collectivity. Secondly, we should be very careful to be clear
to keep our concepts distinct and correct when developing a capability
theory. The modular account of the capability approach has ample
conceptual and theoretical space to account for collective processes,
the social embedding of persons, the influence of social structures on
our choices and opportunities, a proper acknowledgement of social
processes of preference formation as well as the crucial role of social
institutions and norms in shaping a person’s capability set. But if we
want to account for a social process, we shouldn’t just jump to the claim
that we have now found a collective capability. Rather, we should use
the quite complex and multi-layered framework that was presented in
figure 2.1, and be clear when something is a social structure that is shaping
our capabilities, rather than a capability itself. Means to ends (capabilities)

118

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

and the ‘capability determinants’ (the social structures, social norms,
institutions, etc.) can all be part of our evaluation — we just need to
keep in mind which parts of what we evaluate are the means, which
are the ends and why we evaluate a certain dimension. In the case of
the evaluation of the means, one important reason could be to see how
those means have changed over time, as well as whether there is any
scope to improve the contribution that those particular means can make
to the increase of capability sets.

3.7 Which notion of wellbeing is used in the
capability approach?
The capability approach is closely related to notions of wellbeing and
the quality of life. Sometimes it is assumed that the capability approach
is a theory of wellbeing, which cannot be quite right since the capability
approach can be used for many purposes, such as the construction of
a theory of justice, poverty measurement or policy evaluation. Yet on
the other hand, with its proposition that interpersonal comparisons
be made in terms of functionings and/or capabilities, the capability
approach is clearly also involved in offering us an account of wellbeing
(Sen 1984c, 1985c, 2009a; Alkire 2016; Qizilbash 2013). But what, exactly,
is the nature of the account of wellbeing in the capability approach?
I will argue in this chapter that the more precise formulation is that
the capability approach entails several slightly different accounts
of wellbeing, which can be used for different purposes. Different
capability theories have different purposes (module B1) and different
meta-theoretical commitments (module B7), and the choices made in
those modules will require different accounts of wellbeing for such
capability theories.
When one looks at the accounts of wellbeing in the various disciplines
in which the notion of ‘wellbeing’ plays a central role, one quickly
notices that there are a range of quite different accounts proposed
in different paradigms or disciplines, and that there is very limited
discussion between those fields (Gasper 2010). In particular, there is
surprisingly little interaction between the very large philosophical
literature on wellbeing (Crisp 2013; Fletcher 2015) and the (theoretical
and empirical) literature in psychology and economics, or the uses of
the term wellbeing in particular fields, such as development studies

3. Clarifications



119

or medical care. There are a few scholars who have tried to grasp this
discrepancy, as well as explain why the philosophical and theoretical
literatures, as well as the debates in different disciplines, are so little
connected (e.g. Alexandrova 2013; Rodogno 2015b, 2015a). This is the
background against which we must try to understand the place of the
capability approach in thinking about wellbeing, and try to understand
the accounts of wellbeing used in capability theories. I therefore believe
that it is helpful first to try to grasp that scholarly context in somewhat
more detail (section 3.7.1). Then we will briefly look at the standard
typology of wellbeing theories (section 3.7.2), before analysing the
question of which account (or rather, accounts) of wellbeing are entailed
in the capability approach (section 3.7.3).
Before we start, one further clarification may be helpful. Recall
that the capability approach includes a notion of achieved wellbeing
(focussing on functionings) as well as a notion of wellbeing freedom,
represented by one’s capability set (Sen 1985c, 1993a). The distinction
between achieved wellbeing and wellbeing freedom is virtually absent
from the wellbeing literature. In contemporary philosophy, most
philosophical accounts focus on how well life is going for a person,
hence on achieved wellbeing. But clearly, for policy purposes, we will
often focus on wellbeing freedom, since other values, such as respect
for personal autonomy or even human dignity, may prevent us from
having a specific wellbeing outcome as a legitimate policy goal. When
in the capability approach the term ‘wellbeing freedom’ is used, it
refers to what philosophers elsewhere would call ‘opportunities for
wellbeing’. This notion is especially relevant in moral theories where
we try to balance a concern for wellbeing with a concern for individual
freedom to choose: the term ‘wellbeing freedom’ tries to bring together
and integrate those two values.

3.7.1 The aim and context of accounts of wellbeing
Philosophical discussions of wellbeing typically start out from a rather
general definition of wellbeing, stating that wellbeing is about how well
the life of a person is going for that person. The addition ‘for that person’
is important, since it means that in the philosophical literature wellbeing
is generally conceived as what we could call a personal value, or a firstperson value, rather than an institutional value — a value that we have to

120

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

consider when we think about how to organise our collective life. While
this demarcates ‘wellbeing’ from other public values such as ‘justice’ or
‘efficiency’, this is still a very general notion that can be elaborated in
many different ways. Moreover, as was already mentioned, if we look
at the debates in contemporary philosophy of wellbeing, we notice that
they hardly relate at all to the empirical discussions in policy studies
and the social sciences (with the exception of the relatively recent boom
in subjective wellbeing analysis, which will be discussed in section 3.8).
Anna Alexandrova (2013) argues that the diversity in scholarship on
wellbeing can be explained by the fact that the meaning of the use of the
term ‘wellbeing’ differs depending on the context in which it is used. If
the word ‘wellbeing’ is used by a medical doctor, or a policy maker, or a
sociologist, or an adolescent reflecting on her options for her future life,
they all use the term ‘wellbeing’ for different purposes and in a different
context. I would like to add that, in particular, the aim or the purpose of
our use of the term ‘wellbeing’ is crucial. That is, the term ‘wellbeing’
is never used in a vacuum; each use of that term plays a role in either
explanatory or else normative projects. Normative projects always have
a purpose, that is, something to judge, evaluate or recommend, which is
precisely the choice that has to be made in module B1 in the account of
the capability approach presented in chapter 2. Depending on whether
we use the term ‘wellbeing’ for policy making, or for purely descriptive
work, or for deciding what we owe to each other as fellow citizens, the
term wellbeing will play a different function.
Most work on wellbeing in contemporary analytical philosophy is
concerned with answering the question “What would be the best for
someone, or would be most in this person’s interests, or would make
this person’s life go, for him, as well as possible?” (Parfit 1984, 493). This
is especially the case for the literature since the publication of Derek
Parfit’s typology of theories of wellbeing. While Parfit’s typology is
arguably crude, it has been very influential, and still serves an important
function as an influential attempt that a philosopher has made to classify
accounts of wellbeing.
In the next section, we will consider how (if at all) the capability
approach fits into Parfit’s typology. But it is important to note that
this highly abstract, very detailed and analytical strand in philosophy
is only to a very limited degree concerned with (a) empirical

3. Clarifications



121

applicability and measurement or (b) practical consequences, in the
sense of action-guidance such as the establishment of normatively
sound policy making or the question of which social arrangements we
should want. The dominant contemporary philosophical literature on
wellbeing is concerned with philosophical investigation in the sense
of finding truths, and typically focussed on the entire lives of people
from their own, first-person, perspective. That literature is much less
concerned with wellbeing as an institutional value, with asking which
account of wellbeing would be best when deciding what institutions
we should implement — a question that can only be answered after
taking feasibility considerations into account, or considering what
would be best from the point of view of ethically sound policy making.
However, as Alexandrova (2013, 311) rightly points out, “the context
of an all-things-considered evaluation of life as a whole privileged by
philosophers is just that: one of the many contexts in which wellbeing is
in question”. Since most uses of the term ‘wellbeing’ in other debates,
e.g. in applied philosophy or other disciplines, are concerned with
overall evaluations of states of affairs and/or policy making, it shouldn’t
surprise us that there is very little cross-fertilisation between those
philosophical debates and the policy oriented and empirical literatures
in other disciplines. This will have an influence on how we will, in the
next section, answer the question how the capability approach fits into
the standard typology of theories of wellbeing used in philosophy.

3.7.2 The standard taxonomy of
philosophical wellbeing accounts
In Appendix I of his influential book Reasons and Persons, Parfit (1984,
493) suggests that we should make a distinction between three types of
philosophical wellbeing theories.
On Hedonistic Theories, what would be best for someone is what would
make his life happiest. On Desire-Fulfilment Theories, what would be best
for someone is what, throughout this life, would best fulfil his desires.
On Objective List Theories, certain things are good or bad for us, whether
or not we want to have the good things, or to avoid the bad things.

In interdisciplinary conversations, hedonistic theories are today
better known under the label ‘happiness theories’. Interpreted from

122

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

the perspective of the capability approach, hedonistic theories (or the
happiness approach) entail that the only functioning that matters is
happiness. The capability approach stresses what people can do and be
(module A1) and ‘happiness’ or one’s hedonic state at best refers to one
aspect of one’s being, not the various aspects of what we can do. The
capability approach and the happiness approach do share some common
characteristics, such as the fact that both focus on what they take to be of
ultimate value. Yet the two approaches have very different ideas of what
that ‘ultimate value’ should be, with the happiness approach defending
an exclusive choice for a mental state versus the capability approach
defending the focus on a plurality of aspects of our lives. It is therefore
not plausible to see the happiness approach, or hedonism, as a specific
case of the capability approach. However, more can be said about the
precise relation between the capability approach and hedonistic or
happiness approaches, which will be done in section 3.8.
How about the desire-fulfilment theories, or the objective list
theories? Can the notion of wellbeing embedded in the capability
approach plausibly be understood as either of those? Let us first
very briefly describe the two types of theories, and then ask how the
capability approach fits in.
Desire-fulfilment theories of wellbeing claim, essentially, that wellbeing
is the extent to which our desires are satisfied. These desires could
be our current, unquestioned desires. In philosophy, that is a view
that cannot count on many defenders, since it is very easy to think of
examples of current desires that will harm us in the near future, or else
desires for something that is, arguably, not good for us, such as a desire
for excessive amounts of food or alcohol. Philosophers have therefore
proposed more sophisticated views of desires, called ‘informed desires’
(e.g. Sumner 1996). Those are desires that meet additional conditions,
and different proposals have been made for what those conditions
should be. Examples of such additional constraints include not
being ignorant of facts, but also not being deceived, or not suffering
from mental adaptation — which ranges from having adapted one’s
aspirations to one’s dire circumstances, to having adapted one’s desires
to one’s extremely affluent circumstances, to a more general ‘preference
adaptation’ which applies to all of us in societies with social norms and
the widespread use of advertisements.



123

For a philosophical theory of wellbeing, which merely asks the
metaphysical question what is wellbeing for the person who is living that life,
and which has no consequences for the choice of social arrangements
or policy making, the informed desire theory has a very important
attraction: it gives the authority to decide what would make life better
to the person whose wellbeing we are investigating. We also see this
account of wellbeing being helpfully put to work in various other
contexts. For example, if the daughter of a family-owned business
has no interest at all in continuing that business, and argues that her
strongest desire in life is to become a medical doctor, then her parents
may, regretfully, decide that it is indeed better for her to study medicine,
since that is what she really wants. They may perhaps urge her to talk
to a friend who is a medical doctor to get a better understanding of
what that profession entails (that is, to ‘test’ whether her preferences are
properly informed). Yet in such a context, the desire-fulfilment theory of
wellbeing seems apt and appropriate.
The problems with the informed desire-fulfilment theory of
wellbeing are especially relevant in other contexts where an account
of wellbeing is needed for policy making or social change. The most
significant is that our desires are moulded, not fully informed, and
subject to social norms and other forms of societal pressures and
expectations. For example, critics of capitalism argue that advertisement
by profit-seeking companies form our preferences, and make us want
things we would be better off without. There are many subtle forms of
manipulation possible. Students of marketing learn that the products
put at eye-height are more often taken by customers shopping in a
supermarket. At the macro-level, the culture of late-modern capitalism
tells us to find happiness in material success and in trying to achieve
higher status in the dominant social order. We are socialised into these
patterns, often not even aware of their existence. But why would those
desires give us the highest level of wellbeing? Another interesting case
is the standards of beauty that women are expected to meet, which will
make them more attractive and ultimately happier. Dominant norms of
beauty put a huge pressure on women (and increasingly also on men),
leading to anxieties, low self-esteem, and even unhealthy conditions
and illnesses such as anorexia (Lavaque‐Manty 2001). What if we could

124

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

‘reset’ our cultural and social norms, which would lead to less pressure,
stress and fewer anxieties? Some alternative views of living, such as
those advanced by deep ecology thinkers (e.g. Naess 1973, 1984), are
based on the view that with a different set of desires, and a different
appreciation of certain experiences and values, we would be able to
live not only in an ecologically sustainable way, but also have higher
levels of wellbeing. In sum, the desire-fulfilment theory is interesting
and arguably plausible at the individual level, and also at the general
level as a theoretical approach to wellbeing, which can make ample use
of counterfactual and hypothetical thinking and conditions. But it is
much trickier to think about wellbeing from a macro or third-person
perspective in the world as it is, in which we don’t have information on
how each person’s preferences have been formed and influenced.
How does the objective list theory fare? Objective list theories
are accounts of wellbeing that list items that make our lives better,
independent of our own view on this. The claim of objective list theories
is that there is an irreducible plurality of issues that make up wellbeing;
wellbeing is plural and cannot be reduced to a single thing. Secondly,
those items are objectively good for us, whether or not we attach any value
to (or desire) those items. Hence items such as being healthy, or having
friends, or feeling well, are all good for us, whether we personally value
them or not.
What are some of the main strengths and weaknesses of the objective
list theories? Objective list theories are generally criticised for not
respecting people’s views about their own lives, and hence taking away
the authority to decide the quality of those lives from the agents leading
them: in other words, for being paternalistic. Who is to decide that,
say, social relationships are good for us? Now, this seems a very valid
critique if we use an objective list theory for purely descriptive and firstperson truth-seeking purposes, as the vast literature in philosophy does.
But if one uses accounts of wellbeing for policy or political purposes,
the public nature of the dimensions of wellbeing is rather important.
This relates to what political philosophers have called ‘the publicity
criterion’: if wellbeing is used for purposes of institutional design or
policy making, those principles used need to be capable of being known
by all to be satisfied in society (Rawls 2009; Anderson 2010, 85).

3. Clarifications



125

Indeed, this directly relates to an advantage of objective list theories:
many of the items that have been proposed by such theories have been
translated into specific indicators such as health or social policy, or
else overall assessments have been made that can be used for an entire
population. The long-standing literature on social indicators can be
situated in this tradition (Boelhouwer and Stoop 1999; Boelhouwer
2002; Hagerty et al. 2001).

3.7.3 The accounts of wellbeing
in the capability approach
So how does the capability approach fit in this standard taxonomy?
The capability approach is often categorised as being an objective list
theory, since functionings and capabilities are plural and the selection
of dimensions gives us a list of items which are judged to be valuable for
persons. However, in my view there is not merely one wellbeing account
in the capability approach, but several wellbeing accounts.
So why is there not one, but several accounts of wellbeing in the
capability literature? As was mentioned in the introduction to this
section, the reason is that there are a variety of capability theories in the
general capability literature, and those theories need different accounts
of wellbeing. If a capability theory is used for a first-person perspective,
for example by an adolescent contemplating what to do with her life, she
may ask herself what she really wants: to study hard and work hard and
become a medical doctor? Or does she have a stronger desire to build a
family and search for a job that makes it possible to spend enough time
with her children? Does she want to devote her life to fighting for a
good cause? In this personal deliberation, the account of wellbeing she
then uses can be seen as a desire-fulfilment account in which the desires
all refer to functionings.
In the design of institutions, there is also often implicitly a desirefulfilment account, by trying to create valuable options (capabilities) for
citizens, but by not forcing them into those outcomes (functionings). But
policy making can’t be done by trying to enlarge a non-specific general
account of freedom to realise one’s desires: what would that look like?
In policy making, we often assume that what we owe to each other

126

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

are specific freedoms, not a general vague notion of overall freedom
(Anderson 2000b). Therefore, at the policy level we can often see that the
implicit account of wellbeing is desire-fulfilment, whereby it is assumed
that the desires refer to particular functionings (such as being able to
enjoy higher education or leisure activities in green spaces in cities), or,
alternatively, policies provide the resources (money, and sometimes
time) that are inputs for a wide range of desires that people may have.
If a capability theory is made for macro-level poverty analysis, then
the researchers will select a number of functionings that they have
reason to believe are good for people, such as their health, educational
outcomes, and the kind of shelter in which they can live. The notion of
achieved wellbeing entailed in this normative exercise is an objectively
good account, although one could also argue that one has reason
to assume that these are dimensions of the quality of life that people
would want for themselves (hence their desires) and that, given that one
is working with very large numbers, it is a safe assumption to proceed
this way.
There are at least two interesting things to notice. First, for policy
making we often have to choose either an approach that uses resources
as a proxy for wellbeing (although this cannot account for differences
in conversion factors between people) or else policy makers will try
to provide a range of options to us, where ideally the policy maker
assumes that these options are things that many people want. Second,
the often-heard view that the account of wellbeing given by the
capability approach is an objective list theory doesn’t seem to be true.
Rather, depending on the kind of capability theory one is pursuing (in
particular, the choice in B1) it is more accurate to see this as a desirefulfilment or an objective list account.

3.8 Happiness and the capability approach
In section 3.7.2, we encountered hedonist theories of wellbeing as
an important subgroup of theories of wellbeing. The debates about
hedonism and the happiness approach are closely related. Hedonism
is the philosophical view that wellbeing can be captured by the balance
of pleasures over pains. The core aspect is the exclusive focus on
mental states, and on a person’s subjective assessments of their own

3. Clarifications



127

mental state. In recent decades, this approach has been revitalised in
‘the happiness approach’, although empirical scholars prefer the term
‘subjective wellbeing’ (SWB). The happiness and SWB literatures have
in recent years gone through a revival.
On the empirical front, significant progress has been made in the
last few decades by an international network of economists and
psychologists, such as Andrew Clark, Ed Diener, Ada Ferrer-i-Carbonell,
Bruno Frey, Richard Layard, Andrew Oswald, David Schkade, Bernard
van Praag and Ruut Veenhoven.10 Many of these scholars have
concluded that sufficient scientific progress has been made for public
policies to focus on subjective wellbeing. The measures of subjective
wellbeing have been tested and refined, and much is supposedly known
about the determinants of happiness that the government can influence.
The happiness and SWB approaches are strongly focussed on empirical
analysis and policy design, and this is also, therefore, the main lens that
will be used in the comparison with the capability approach, although
we will very briefly discuss the comparison between the theoretical
happiness approach and the capability approach.
From the perspective of the capability approach, the happiness
approach raises three questions: First, what is the happiness approach,
exactly? Second, what are its strengths and weaknesses? Third, what
role can happiness play in the capability approach?11

3.8.1 What is the happiness approach?
The happiness approach is based on the assumption that wellbeing (or
quality of life) is constituted by the subjective experiences of a person,
expressed in terms of utility, happiness, or satisfaction. Satisfaction
can be expressed in terms of overall satisfaction with life, or satisfaction
within particular domains, such as income, health, family relationships,
labour, and so forth.

See, for example, Veenhoven (1996); Kahneman et al. (2006); Schkade and
Kahneman (1998); Diener and Seligman (2004); Van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell
(2004); Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005); Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Gowdy (2007); Frey and
Stutzer (2002).
11	This section draws on, yet also modifies and expands, the analysis presented in
Robeyns and Van der Veen (2007, 33–42).

128

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

In the happiness approach, life satisfaction is understood as a concept
that combines two components: how we normally feel in everyday
life — the affective or ‘hedonistic’ component — and how we judge
the degree to which our preferences and aspirations in life have been
realised — the cognitive component. In order to find out how ‘happy’
a person is, respondents are asked, for example, to rate how satisfied
they are with their life on a scale from 1 to 10 (to measure the cognitive
component) and to report their mood at particular moments of the day,
sometimes even with the aid of a buzzer set to go off at random times (to
measure the affective component). In another method, the respondents
are asked to imagine the worst possible life and to give that life a value
of 0, to imagine the best possible life and give that a value of 10, and then
to rate their own life on a scale from 0 to 10.
The view in the happiness literature is that overall life satisfaction
should be adopted as the official ‘policy guide’, and the task of the
government is to aim for the highest possible average level of life
satisfaction (Hagerty et al. 2001; Layard 2011). For comparisons in the
long term, Ruut Veenhoven also proposes to measure the quality of
life based on ‘happy life expectancy’. This is an index obtained from
multiplying life expectancy in a country with average overall life
satisfaction (Veenhoven 1996).
Is the happiness approach, or the SWB approach, the best basis for
thinking about wellbeing and the quality of life, especially against the
background of policy design? The happiness approach certainly has a
number of attractive features. Firstly, it puts the human being centre stage,
rather than focusing on the means that human beings use to improve
their quality of life. Hence the approach satisfies the core criterion from
module A that means and ends should not be conceptually confused.
Secondly, in considering the means to happiness, the subjective approach
is not limited to material means, which is the major shortcoming of the
dominant economic empirical methods. Income has only a limited (but
not unimportant) role to play in generating happiness.
In conclusion, the happiness approach does have some significant
strengths, but it also gives rise to some concerns. We will briefly discuss
the main theoretical problem, and then look in more detail at the worries
raised for empirical research and policy making.

3.8.2 The ontological objection
The theoretical worry is an ontological worry, that is, it asks what
wellbeing is, and questions whether this can be captured by mental states
only. This objection was forcefully made by Robert Nozick (1974, 42–45)
when he introduced the ‘experience machine’ thought experiment.
Nozick ask us to imagine that we are invited to be plugged into a
machine, which would stimulate our brain and make us feel as if we
were having a range of experiences that we could choose beforehand; all
the time, we would be floating in a tank with electrodes attached to our
brain. Would we choose such a life? Nozick claims we would not, and
interestingly enough the arguments he gives to justify this claim refer
to our functionings and capabilities.12 According to Nozick, three things
matter to us in addition to our experiences. First, we do not only want
to have the experience of doing certain things (which we could have by
sitting and taking drugs) but we also want to do certain things. Second,
“we want to be a certain way, to be a certain sort of person” (Nozick
1974, 43). Third, we don’t want to limit our experiences to a man-made
reality (the experience machine) but also to have the opportunity to be
in contact with deeper significance. The insight from Nozick’s thought
experiment is thus that a good life cannot be reduced to mental states, but
must also contain some genuine activities and states of being. According
to Nozick (1974, 43), “someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate
blob”, not a human being to whom we can describe human wellbeing.
There is thus more to human wellbeing then merely feeling happy. If
decent labour, knowledge, appreciating art and culture, and intimate
relationships are to be valued only, or even primarily, because of their
contribution to overall or specific life satisfaction, then we could say this
is a misrecognition of the contribution they make to how well our lives
progress. Phenomenologically speaking, this is an implausible account
of wellbeing.

12	Obviously, Nozick didn’t use the terminology of the capability approach, but his
account of what is valuable in life could nevertheless be seen as capabilitarian.

3.8.3 Mental adaptation and social comparisons
How about the worries related to empirical research and policy
making? The first worry at this level is raised by processes of mental
adaptation and social comparisons. Our satisfaction is to some extent
influenced by mental adaptation issues that emerge from comparisons
with the situations of others. This can have problematic implications for
public policies aiming at the highest happiness for the greatest number.
Take the mental adaptation processes first. How do these emerge? First
of all, there can be shocks in our lives that have a major effect on our
wellbeing, such as immobility after an accident. People confronted with
a major setback in health and mobility through such an impairment
will first experience a strong deterioration of their subjective wellbeing,
but after a while this effect will weaken. Obviously, this adaptation to
circumstances is good, since a disabled person will not remain deeply
unhappy for the rest of her life due to her limited abilities to move around
without pain. However, the question is what this implies for policy. A
utilitarian will say that the government has to limit itself to creating
provisions such that a disabled person can return to an acceptable
level of life satisfaction, taking into account the corresponding welfare
costs for others.13 A utilitarian would even say that there is no reason
to invest in prevention if this is more expensive than rehabilitation. But
one could also argue that a cost-sensitive policy has to try to reach an
acceptable level of functioning for a disabled person, even if this makes
little difference to her subjective judgement about her wellbeing after
adapting to the accident. Subjective indicators focus automatically on
the first goal, but this may imply that the quality aspects that relate to
the things a person still can do after the accident remain out of sight.
Secondly, people can adapt to an objective disadvantage that is not
caused by an external shock, but that shows a more stable pattern. This is
the problem of ‘adaptive preferences’, which is particularly relevant for

13	A more fine-grained analysis than that presented in this section would need to
make the distinction between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism, and ask
whether both are vulnerable to these critiques to the same extent. I am assuming
here that the critiques apply to both types of utilitarianism to such a degree that it
leads to worrying consequences.

the happiness approach.14 Amartya Sen has pointed out repeatedly that
people living at the very bottom of the social ladder (such as ‘exploited
labourers’ or ‘oppressed housewives’) adapt to their situation and come
to suffer less intensely. Another example is the effect of racism. If a
society becomes gradually less tolerant towards cultural minorities and
increasingly accepts racist practices, then cultural minorities might get
used to a racist social climate. Perhaps they will change their behaviour,
in order to avoid contact with openly racist people. By changing their
behaviour and mentally preparing for racist practices, it is possible
that after a while the negative wellbeing effect of racism on minority
groups will be partially wiped out. However, a policy that anticipates
such adaptation processes is morally and politically problematic: racism
should not be tolerated in society, even if it were not to have a significant
impact on the subjective wellbeing of its victims. In order to judge that
racism is not morally permissible and hence that policies should try
to minimize racism, we don’t first need to investigate whether racism
makes its victims less happy: that’s simply beside the point. Even if
the victims of racism acted stoically and didn’t let racism affect their
happiness levels, that wouldn’t make racism any less undesirable.
Another form of mental adaptation which is relevant for the
government is the adjustment response to income changes. Subjective
wellbeing judgements about income have been shown to adapt
asymmetrically to income changes. Income increases go together with
higher aspirations for the future, with only one third of the increase
being reflected by improvements of subjective wellbeing (Frey and
Stutzer 2002). Panel-analysis over a period of ten years shows that we
adapt strongly to an increase in income, but much less so to a drop
in income (Burchardt 2005). Thus, if people change positions in an
income distribution which itself remains unchanged, then aggregate
satisfaction of the population will decrease. The people who move up
the ladder will be more satisfied for a short time, but quickly adapt to
the new situation, whereas people who move downwards experience a
larger drop in satisfaction — and this effect lasts longer as well. Tania
Burchardt (2006) argues that due to similar phenomena of adaptation,
people’s positions in the distribution of income, health and marital
14	Yet the phenomenon of ‘adaptive preferences’ can also potentially create problems
for some capability theories, as we will analyse in section 3.9.

132

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

status should preferably remain immobile, according to utilitarianism.
Clearly this is a policy conclusion that goes against the principle that
people should receive equal opportunities, even if the effect of one
person’s upward social mobility is not compensated by the effect of
another person’s downward social mobility.
How serious are these problems of mental adaptation for the
subjective approach? In part, the response to this question depends on
our normative judgements about the counter-intuitive and sometimes
perverse implications of a policy that single-mindedly aims to promote
maximal average utility. It also depends, however, on the empirical
question of how strong these mental adaptation processes are in reality.
According to Veenhoven, overall life satisfaction is primarily determined
by the affective component, and therefore it is much less vulnerable to
the effects of mental adaptation than satisfaction in particular domains,
which he judges to be much more vulnerable to adaptation. However,
the work of Kahneman and Krueger (2006, 17–18) shows that mental
adaptation processes are clearly present even when predominantly
affective measures of overall happiness experiences are adopted.
There are additional concerns related to the subjective wellbeing
findings in particular domains, such as income or education. Recall
the literature reporting on the findings that subjective wellbeing is
also strongly influenced by social comparisons with reference groups.
In particular, the wellbeing effect of income, but also of education, is
affected by the levels reached by members of the reference groups to
which individuals compare their own situation. As a consequence,
increases in income, or additional educational credentials, contribute
less to satisfaction in these domains, the more income or educational
progress is achieved within the reference groups. Apparently, these
resources have a stronger positional component than other resources
do, in particular leisure time, where the comparison effect appears to
have a much weaker impact on wellbeing obtained from an additional
unit of free time.
In conclusion, there seems to be little consensus in the subjective
wellbeing literature on the question of whether, and to what extent,
phenomena of mental adaptation and reference groups cause problems
for the measurement of overall life satisfaction. However, all researchers
do acknowledge that satisfaction in some domains is susceptible to

3. Clarifications



133

these phenomena, and this may result in the counter-intuitive policy
implications we mentioned earlier.

3.8.4 Comparing groups
The second worry about the happiness or SWB approach concerns
the effect of group differences, which will be a problem if we need an
account of wellbeing to compare wellbeing levels between groups. The
subjective wellbeing approach focuses on the affective and cognitive
responses of people to their lives overall, or in particular domains. If
groups differ on average in their responses to a situation, then this
may cause problems for policies, if those differences correlate with the
objective circumstances that one would intuitively judge as important.
There are two symmetric possibilities: (1) groups who are in the same
objective situation have different levels of life satisfaction, or (2) groups
with the same level of life satisfaction are in different situations, whereby
it is clear that one situation is worse than the other independently of
subjective wellbeing.
Research has indeed shown that the average level of life satisfaction
between demographic groups differs systematically. In other words, if
we control for the relevant factors, then some groups are significantly
less satisfied with their lives than others. For example, recent Australian
research (Cummins et al. 2003) shows that women report a higher
level of overall life satisfaction than men, after taking a number of
control-variables into account.15 The researchers cannot pinpoint the
exact causes of this finding, but they do not exclude the possibility that
women are ‘constitutionally’ more satisfied than men. This may have a
biological explanation, but it may also be the consequence of processes
of adaptation that men and women experience differently over their
lifetimes.
If the aim of the account of wellbeing is to inform public policy, then
the question is how government should deal with these findings. From
a utilitarian perspective, it would be efficient to develop a policy that
is advantageous to men. For example, if due to unemployment men
experience a larger drop in happiness than women, as reported by Frey
15	A similar strong and significant gender effect has been found by Eriksson, Rice and
Goodin (2007).

134

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

and Stutzer (2002, 419), then a policy that gives men priority on the
labour market will minimise the average wellbeing damage in terms of
happiness. But the fact that one demographic group (women, the worst
off, the elderly, and so forth) are made less unhappy due to a certain
event than other groups can cause perverse policy implications if life
satisfaction is declared to be the guideline for policies. Fundamental
political principles such as non-discrimination and equality of
opportunities for all citizens are thereby put into jeopardy. This would
also be true in the symmetric case where the average level of life
satisfaction of discriminated or marginalised groups does not differ
significantly from the average level of a group that is not faced with
these disadvantages. I do not want to claim here that the subjective
wellbeing approach will always lead to such injustices. But I do think
that a central focus on subjective wellbeing will make policies less
sensitive to signalling and combating these injustices. Hence Burchardt
(2005, 94) is right in pointing out that “satisfaction — the best proxy
we have for the concept of utility — is unsuitable for assessing current
wellbeing, justice or equality”.

3.8.5 Macro analysis
A third worry concerns the applicability of the subjective wellbeing
approach at the national or regional levels of policy making. One may
agree that the happiness approach can be very helpful when it can offer
persons with low affect (negative moods and feelings) concrete strategies
to change that, such as engaging in mindfulness training and practice.
Yet what about policy making? Are the happiness indicators sufficiently
refined and sensitive for policy at lower levels of aggregation than the
level of a country? In their discussion of the criteria that an index of the
quality of life should meet, Hagerty and his co-authors (2001, 2) include
the criterion that the index must help policy makers to develop and
evaluate policies at all levels of aggregation. Thus, the index should not
only be useful for the national government, but also for governments in
cities, communities, and regions. As Robert van der Veen and I argued
in earlier work, overall life satisfaction does not satisfactorily meet this
criterion (Robeyns and Van der Veen 2007); it is too crude for these
purposes. It is even less suitable for the evaluation of specific policy

3. Clarifications



135

interventions (Cummins et al. 2003). The effect of one policy measure
such as improved child care facilities will be reflected hardly or not at all
in reported overall life satisfaction, even if such policies have significant
effects on the real opportunities of parents to organise their lives as they
think best — hence on their capabilities. Overall ‘happy life expectancy’
is, by contrast, well-suited for comparing the effects of fundamental
political and economic institutions on subjective wellbeing. This
emerges clearly from the work of Veenhoven (1996), which concentrates
on studies whereby the unit of analysis is the country. In other words,
Veenhoven mainly uses happy life expectancy as an indicator for macroanalysis. The variables that emerge as the determinants of happy life
expectancy are therefore typically system variables such as the degree
of political freedom, or the presence of rule of law. But the quality
of life in a micro-situation (say, living in a particular community or
neighbourhood) is also influenced by many other variables.

3.8.6 The place of happiness in the capability approach
The previous sections argued that happiness can’t be taken to represent
a person’s wellbeing for many purposes, including policy purposes. Yet
it would also be deeply counter-intuitive to say that happiness doesn’t
matter at all. It may be the right concept of wellbeing for other aims.
How, then, can happiness be given a proper place within the capability
approach?
The first possibility is to see happiness, or some more specific
capabilities that are closely related to the affective component of
subjective wellbeing, as one important dimension to be selected. In fact,
Amartya Sen has for many years argued that we could take ‘feeling
happy’ as one of the functionings to be selected. For example, Sen (2008,
26) wrote:
happiness, however, is extremely important, since being happy is a
momentous achievement in itself. Happiness cannot be the only thing
that we have reason to value, nor the only metric for measuring other
things that we value, but on its own, happiness is an important human
functioning. The capability to be happy is, similarly, a major aspect of
the freedom that we have good reason to treasure. The perspective of
happiness illuminates one critically important element of human living.

136

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Indicators of happiness are already included, for example, by
incorporating dimensions of mental health into capability applications.
Certain specific functionings, which make up an overall ‘mental health’
functioning, already contain such affective items: whether, over the
last week, the respondent has felt down or worthless, for example, or
whether one is free from worry.
Second, we can try to capture the cognitive aspect of happiness,
that is, a person’s satisfaction with her capability set, or with particular
options from that set. We can then compare that person’s level of
satisfaction with her capabilities, which should allow us to compare the
objective situation with a person’s satisfaction with that situation. For
example, the absence of criminality is a valuable functioning.16 But there
is a long-standing finding in criminology that there are discrepancies
between the objective incidence of being safe versus the subjective
feeling of being in danger of becoming a victim of crime. For example,
even if the incidence and impact of criminality goes down, it can still be
the case that the population is more worried about crime than before
and feels less safe. The discrepancy between objective outcomes and
subjective perception is instructive here; it may imply, for example, that
the government should communicate more effectively about its success
in reducing crime, so as to make the subjective perception more in line
with the objective reality, or it should work directly on factors that
impact on the subjective experience of safety feelings.
Third, capability scholars would, of course, hope that an enlarging of
people’s functionings and capabilities would, as a further effect, increase
their feelings of happiness and satisfaction, and serve as a (sometimes
rough) indicator of people’s satisfaction with their functionings and
capabilities (Sen 2008, 26–27). Not all functionings will lead to people
becoming happier, yet their lives may still be better: more flourishing, or
more meaningful, or with a higher quality of life, or with a greater degree
of freedom that could be realised. An interesting example is the case of
writing a PhD dissertation. Very few PhD students would say that this
is what makes them happy in the sense outlined above. So why, then,
do so many graduates want to earn a doctoral degree, and give some of
the best years of their lives to what often becomes a stressful time? It is
hard to understand this, if one doesn’t take into account the meaning it
16	Perhaps criminals would disagree.

3. Clarifications



137

brings to their lives. The capability approach can capture this — taking
on a difficult and challenging project such as writing a PhD dissertation
can plausibly be conceptualised as a general functioning (consisting of
a set of more specific functionings) that we may want to include in our
capability analyses, including in our capabilitarian theories of wellbeing
for public policies.
I would thus defend the position that various roles for happiness are
potentially possible within capability theories, and that it depends on
the exact purpose and scope of the capability theory or application, as
well as the aim that wellbeing plays in that capability theory, what the
best role (if any) for both the affective and cognitive aspects of happiness
would be.

3.9 The capability approach and adaptive
preferences
As we saw in the previous section, a widely-voiced reason offered
for rejecting the happiness approach as an account of wellbeing is the
phenomenon of adaptive preferences, which has been widely discussed
in the literature (e.g. Elster 1983; Sen 1985c, 3, 1992a; Nussbaum 2000;
Teschl and Comim 2005; Burchardt 2009; Khader 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013;
Conradie and Robeyns 2013). Phenomena of mental adaption are a
problem if we take happiness or desire-satisfaction to be our account
of wellbeing. Yet we also concluded in section 3.7.3 that the capability
approach sometimes boils down to a desire-fulfilment account of
wellbeing. Hence we need to ask: how do processes of adaptation affect
the desire-fulfilment view of wellbeing, and what are the implications
for the capability approach?
In the most general terms, preferences formation or adaptation is
the phenomenon whereby the subjective assessment of one’s wellbeing
is out of line with the objective situation. Two persons who find
themselves in the same objective situation will have a very different
subjective assessment, because one is happy with small amounts of
‘objective goods’, whereas the other is much more demanding. In the
capability literature, the general concern is with deprived persons
who, over time, adapt to their objectively poor circumstances, and
report a level of subjective wellbeing which is higher than the objective
circumstances warrant.

138

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

The idea of adaptation can take different forms. Jon Elster (1983)
referred to one particular type of adaptation, in which being unable
to fulfil a preference or realise an aspiration leads one to reject that
preference or aspiration. This phenomenon is known as ‘sour grapes’:
the fox who cannot pick the grapes, because they are hanging too
high for him, starts telling himself that they are sour anyway, and no
longer desires to eat them. On Elster’s account, adaptation occurs at
a non-conscious level, as a reaction to the painful process of cognitive
dissonance that a person who can’t fulfil her unreachable desires or
aspirations feels. Elster’s notion of adaptive preferences only refers to
a process, and makes no reference to an objective notion of wellbeing.
These psychological aspects of adaptation are echoed in Sen’s reference
to this phenomenon, when he writes that “considerations of ‘feasibility’
and of ‘practical possibility’ enter into what we dare to desire and what
we are pained not to get” (Sen 1985a, 15). Adaptive preferences are
a reason for Sen to reject a focus on mental metrics, such as utility or
happiness, as the metric of wellbeing. After all, someone who is in an
objectively dire situation may have adapted to that situation and learnt
to be pleased with little. As Sen (1985c, 21) puts it, “A person who is
ill-fed, undernourished, unsheltered and ill can still be high up in the
scale of happiness or desire-fulfilment if he or she has learned to have
‘realistic’ desires and to take pleasure in small mercies”.
Serene Khader (2011) has argued that not all cases that we tend to
consider as cases of adaptive preferences fit Elster’s conceptualisation.
Khader believes that an account of adaptive preferences must make
reference to an objective notion of flourishing, even if that notion
remains vague and only focusses on basic flourishing (since there is
more intercultural agreement on what basic flourishing entails). She
develops the following definition:
An adaptive preference is a preference that (1) is inconsistent with a
person’s basic flourishing, (2) was formed under conditions nonconducive
to her basic flourishing, and (3) that we do not think a person would
have formed under conditions conductive to basic flourishing. (Khader
2011, 51)

A similarly perfectionist, but much less systematically developed
account of adaptive preferences can be found in Martha Nussbaum’s

3. Clarifications



139

work. She understands adaptive preferences as the preferences of
people who do not want to have items of her list of capabilities, whereby
these preferences are deformed due to injustices, oppression, ignorance
and unreflective habit (Nussbaum 2000, 114).
What questions do adaptive preferences raise for the capability
approach? At the very minimum, they raise the following questions:
first, why would adaptive preferences pose a problem for capability
theories? Second, do we have any evidence about the prevalence of
adaptive preferences? And third, how can capability scholars deal with
adaptive preferences in their capability theories and applications?
Let us start with the first of these questions: why would adaptive
preferences pose a problem for capability theories? There are at least
two reasons. The first lies in module B2, the selection of dimensions. If
that selection is done in a participatory or democratic way, then it may
be vulnerable to adaptive preferences. A group that is systematically
socialised to have low aspirations and ambitions will perhaps not put
certain capabilities on its list, thereby telling themselves that they are
unachievable, whereas objectively speaking they are achievable, albeit
perhaps only after some social changes have taken place. The second
reason is that a person with adaptive preferences may objectively have
access to a certain capability, but may believe that either this capability
is not available to her, or else that she should not choose it, and hence
she may pick from her capabilities set a suboptimal combination of
functionings. If we then assume that this person (or group) has nonadaptive preferences, then we will wrongly interpret the choice not
to exercise certain capabilities as a matter of personal agency, which a
capability theory that focusses on capabilities rather than functionings,
should respect. The capability approach by default regards adults as
agents rather than patients, but this may be problematic in the case of
adaptive preferences.
So we can conclude that adaptive preferences can pose a problem for
capability theories in which the choice of dimensions is made democratic,
or in which we focus on capabilities rather than functionings. But a critic
may raise the question: do we have any evidence about the prevalence
of adaptive preferences? Is this not a theoretical problem invented by
philosophers who like complex puzzles, or by western scholars who
pity the lives of poor people in the Global South?

140

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

There are at least two answers to be given to this question. The
first is that there are indeed good reasons to be very careful with the
conclusions we draw when studying adaptive preferences, especially
in a context with which one is not familiar. Serene Khader (2011,
55–60) provides a nuanced and convincing discussion of the various
mistakes that can be made when we try to identify whether a person
or group of persons living under unjust conditions expresses adaptive
preferences. There are at least three ‘occupational hazards’ that those
trying to identify adaptive preferences may make: we run the risk of
psychologizing structural constraints, of misidentifying possible tradeoffs between various dimensions of wellbeing that a person makes, or
we may be unable to recognise forms of flourishing in very different
culture or class settings. All this shows that thinking about adaptive
preferences needs to be done with great attention to contextual details
and in a very careful manner; it is not an analysis that can easily be
done by applying a rigid formula. Scholars should therefore be very
cautious before concluding that someone or a group shows adaptive
preferences, and carefully investigate alternative interpretations of
what they observe, since otherwise they run the risk of seeing adaptive
preferences where there are none.
Having said this, it is clear from the literature that adaptive preferences
are a genuine phenomenon. For example, Serene Khader (2011)
discusses real cases of groups of women who had adaptive preferences.
Tania Burchardt analysed the 1970 British Cohort Study and found that
“among those able to formulate agency goals, the aspirations expressed
are conditioned by their socio-economic background and experience”
(Burchardt 2009, 13). She also found evidence that adaptation may play
a role in the selection of functionings from one’s capability set, since
among the sixteen-year-olds who have the capability to continue fulltime education, the choice whether or not to do so is highly influenced
by past deprivation and experiences of inequality. Burchardt rightly
concludes that if the influence on people’s choices is so systematically
related to previous experiences of disadvantage, that this is a case of
injustice. Hence the need, for capability theorists and not just for those
endorsing the happiness approach or the desire-fulfilment theory
of wellbeing, to take processes of adapted preferences and adapted
aspirations seriously. On the other hand, as David Clark (2009, 32)
argued in the context of development studies, adaptive preferences may

3. Clarifications



141

not be as widespread as some capability theorists make it out to be: “the
available evidence only provides limited support for the adaptation
argument and is not always easy to interpret”. Given the “occupational
hazards” that those trying to identify adaptive preferences face (Khader
2011, 55–60), it is important not to ‘see’ adaptive preferences where
there are none. In conclusion, the capability scholar will have to balance
the tricky tasks of neither ignoring processes of adaption, nor making
the adaptation problem bigger than it really is.
This brings us to the last question: can the capability approach deal
with these issues? Given that capability theories and applications can
be very diverse, we will need different methods to handle the issue of
adaptive preferences for different capability theories and applications.
In the context of action-research, small-scale projects and grassroots
strategies, what is required above all is deliberation and interaction with
people of whom one may be worried that their preferences may show
signs of adaption, as exemplified by Ina Conradie in her project with
women in a South African township (Conradie 2013; Conradie and
Robeyns 2013). Khader (2011) has developed ‘a deliberative perfectionist
approach to adaptive preference intervention’, in which a practitioner
who suspects that a group of people has adaptive preferences will first
attempt to understand how the suspected preferences affect their basic
flourishing. This must be done via deliberative processes — a strategy
that we also see in Conradie’s research. If the practitioner has good
reasons to suspect that some of the preferences are adapted, she can
involve those with the alleged adaptive preference in a discussion and
together search for a strategy for change. Note that there is an interesting
parallel here with the grassroots-based development model that has
been proposed by Solava Ibrahim (2017), in which ‘a conscientization
process’ is an integral part of the development process. In this process,
a person reflects critically on her life, develops aspirations for better
living conditions, and makes a plan of action to bring about the
desired change (Ibrahim 2017, 206). While, as Ibrahim rightly notes,
adaptive preferences and aspirations may provide a challenge for this
conscientization process, they are also very likely to be challenged and
hence changed via such a process.
What about capability applications that involve the empirical analysis
of large-scale datasets? How can adaptation be dealt with in those
applications? Here, the capability approach needs to use insights from

142

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

the disciplines that have built most expertise in large-scale adaptation
processes, such as sociology and social policy studies. Based on the
insights from those disciplines, we know the likely candidates to be
dimensions of adaptation — such as social class, caste or gender. We can
then use indicators of those dimensions to study whether preferences
and aspirations systematically differ, as in the earlier mentioned study
by Tania Burchardt (2009). But it is clear that this can only help us to
identify adapted preferences or adapted aspirations; it will not always
tell us whether for each application it is possible to ‘launder’ the data so
as to clean them from processes of unjust adaptations.

3.10 Can the capability approach be an
explanatory theory?
In almost all capability applications and theories, the capability
approach is developed for conceptual and normative purposes, rather
than for explanations. If it is used for conceptual work, then capability
theories do not explain poverty, inequality, or wellbeing, but rather
help us to conceptualize these notions. If capability analyses are used
for normative work, then they help to evaluate states of affairs and
prescribe recommendations for intervention and change.
Nevertheless, the notions of functionings and capabilities in
themselves can be employed as elements in explanations of social
phenomena, or one can use these notions in descriptions of poverty,
inequality, quality of life and social change. In those cases, the
properties A1 to A4 from module A would still hold, but characteristics
A5 (functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space), A6 (other
dimensions of intrinsic values can be important for normative analyses)
and A7 (normative individualism) are not applicable.
To the best of my knowledge, few scholars use the capability
approach in this way. Probably this should not be surprising, since the
capability approach may not make a significant difference to this type of
work. Still, there are parallels with existing studies. For example, there
is a large literature on the social determinants of health (e.g. Marmot
2005; Wilkinson and Marmot 2003; Marmot et al. 2008). The goal here
is to establish a set of functionings related to the general functioning
of being healthy, and the determinants are investigated so that social

3. Clarifications



143

interventions are possible. The same is done for other functionings — not
surprisingly, since explaining the determinants of valuable social states
is one of the main aims of social scientists.
This raises the question of whether the capability approach should
aspire to do this kind of explanatory capabilitarian analysis. The answer
depends on a further question: whether the capability approach would
have any added value in conducting explanatory capability analyses. If
not, then it is unclear why this should be part of the capability approach,
since there seems to be very little value in doing what others are already
doing successfully.
But this pessimistic dismissal of the potential of explanatory
capability analyses may be too quick. Perhaps the capability approach
has a role to play in synthesising and connecting these field-specific
lines of explanatory research; since it is a strongly interdisciplinary
approach, it may perhaps also have a role to play in bringing different
disciplines within the social and behavioural sciences together. Another
very important task of the capability approach is to reach out to those
disciplines in order to make bridges between the normative and
the explanatory analyses — one valuable element of the truly postdisciplinary agenda to which the capability approach aims to contribute.

3.11 A suitable theory for all normative questions?
The capability approach is primarily a normative theory, but are there
also restrictions on which normative questions it can help to address?
Or is it suitable for all normative questions?
In order to answer this, it is helpful to remind us of the key distinction
in philosophical ethics between the right and the good. Questions about
the good focus on what makes life valuable and include discussions
about wellbeing, autonomy, freedom, and love. Questions about the
right focus on how we should act in order for that action to be morally
sound, as well as discussions about how institutions and policies should
be designed so as not to violate universal moral rules. Here, the central
issues concern fairness, respect and the avoidance of harm. Different
moral theories give different answers to the question of how the good
and the right relate to each other.

144

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

In philosophical ethics, if we say that an issue is a moral issue, this
implies that we have duties to comply with the moral norm, no matter
how we feel about it. These are very stringent and universal duties.
An example is: do not kill an innocent person; or: respect the human
dignity of all persons. Normative questions are much broader, and can
also entail other values, such as prudential value (wellbeing). Questions
about the right are questions about morality, whereas for most ethical
frameworks questions about the good are questions about other areas of
normativity, but not morality straight.17
The modular view that has been presented in chapter 2 has in the
core module A only normative properties related to the good. Properties
A1 and A2 define functionings and capabilities, and property A5 claims
that a person’s advantage should focus on functionings and capabilities:
this gives the capability approach the core of its theory of the good. The
complete theory of the good may be extended by additional choices
made in module C4.
What does the core of the capability approach (module A) have to
say about the right? The only property related to the right is normative
individualism. There are no additional claims related to the right
included in module A. Hence, the only conclusion we can draw is that
the capability approach would claim that, if and whenever rightness
involves a notion of the good, one should use the theory of the good as
entailed by the core characteristics of the capability approach. Hence,
if we believe that the right thing to do is to prioritise the lives of the
worst-off, then a capabilitarian version of this claim would say that we
should prioritise the functionings and/or capabilities of the worst-off
rather than their happiness or their command over resources.
Yet many claims concerning the right make no reference to an
account of the good. The core of the capabilities approach is, thus,
orthogonal to other aspects of the theory of the right, except for ethical
individualism, which is only a very small part of a theory of the right.
The fact that the capability approach has, at its very core, more to offer
in terms of the theory of the good than in terms of the theory of the
right has an important implication, namely that the capability approach is
17	An influential exception are utilitarians and other consequentialists, who define the
morally right as that which maximizes the (non-moral) good (Driver 2014; SinnottArmstrong 2015).

not very suitable for ethical issues that only concern questions about the right.
For example, the capability approach is not a very helpful theory when
analysing the morality of abortion since so much of that ethical debate
is about issues of the right rather than about issues of the good. That is,
most of the philosophical debates on the ethics of abortion concern the
moral status of the foetus, notions of personhood, or questions about
the autonomy and self-ownership of the pregnant woman — issues
on which the capability approach remains mute.18 It is therefore not
surprising that the capability approach is more useful and more widely
used as a theory analysing socio-economic policies where there is a
consensus on those aspects that are questions about the right or where
the questions about the right are much less weighty than those about the
good. Examples include debates about poverty alleviation, distributive
justice, environmental ethics and disability ethics. In sum, the capability
approach is not a very helpful (or the most illuminating) framework for
normative analyses in which elements regarding deontological duties
and rights, which are not conceptually closely related to notions of
wellbeing, play the most important role — that is, where aspects of the
right are crucial in addressing the normative questions.

3.12 The role of resources
in the capability approach
In section 2.6.4 we discussed property A4, which stresses the importance
of the difference between means and ends in the capabilities approach.
In section 2.6.5, we discussed property A5, which claims that in the
capability approach functionings and capabilities form the evaluative
space. From these two core properties from module A, some may draw
the conclusion that resources are no longer important in the capability
approach. This is a mistake. Resources are important, although in an
instrumental manner.
Firstly, a focus on functionings and capabilities does not necessarily
imply that a capability analysis would not pay any attention to resources,

18	Philosophical arguments on the moral permissibility of abortion come to widely
divergent conclusions (e.g. Thomson 1971; Tooley 1972; English 1975; Marquis
1989).

146

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

or to the evaluation of social institutions, economic growth, technical
advancement, and so forth. While functionings and capabilities are of
ultimate concern, other dimensions can be important as well, but in
an instrumental way, or as indicators for what ultimately matters. For
example, in their evaluation of development in India, Drèze and Sen
have stressed that working within the capability approach in no way
excludes the integration of an analysis of resources:
It should be clear that we have tended to judge development by the
expansion of substantive human freedoms — not just by economic
growth (for example, of the gross national product), or technical progress,
or social modernization. This is not to deny, in any way, that advances in
the latter fields can be very important, depending on circumstances, as
‘instruments’ for the enhancement of human freedom. But they have to
be appraised precisely in that light — in terms of their actual effectiveness
in enriching the lives and liberties of people — rather than taking them
to be valuable in themselves. (Drèze and Sen 2002, 3)

Second, once we have decided which capabilities are relevant, we need
to investigate the determinants of those capabilities — the factors which
affect their emergence, size and robustness. As figure 2.1 illustrates,
these determinants include resources, a person’s set of conversion
factors and structural constraints. Hence if we want to expand the
capabilities of a person or a group, these are the levels at which we
could intervene. Resources are not the only things that matter, and for
some capabilities that we try to expand or try to equalise, resources
may not be the most effective factor of intervention. At the same time,
it is also clear that resources are very important for most capabilities
and there are hardly any capabilities where resources play no role at
all. Being able to buy presents enhances the capability of affiliation and
social interaction; being able to get the best medical care enhances the
capability of health; and being able to afford time off and time to travel
enhances the capability to enjoy nature. Hence even those capabilities
that could be seen as non-material dimensions of advantage are
nevertheless also aided by the availability of resources, albeit probably
not in a linear way, and perhaps only up to a certain threshold level. If
a capability analysis is aimed at making an intervention, then the exact
relationship between resources and functionings needs to be studied
for each capability analysis, rather than being assumed to have a
certain shape.

3. Clarifications

147

Third, in empirical research there are often data constraints that force
scholars to work with resources as proxies for valuable functionings.
There is nothing inconsistent in taking that path, as long as one is
careful in the conclusions that one draws from an analysis of resources.
Moreover, if one uses multiple resources, such as a combination of
income, time, and human and social capital (e.g. Burchardt 2010), then
the informational riches of the analysis increases, compared to a onedimensional monetary analysis.

3.13 The capability approach
and theories of justice
Discussions about inequality and justice are very important within
the capability literature. In fact, they are so important that many
philosophers studying the capability approach have made the mistake
of believing that it is a theory of equality, or a theory of justice. But as
the descriptions of the capability approach in chapter 2 have shown,
that is not the case. Here, too, we need to make use of the distinction
between the general capability approach and more specific capability
theories: theorizing justice is only one among many different purposes
that capability theories can have, that is, one of the possible choices we
can make in module B1.19 Still, given that the capability approach offers
a distinct view on interpersonal comparisons of advantage, it should
not surprise us that the capability approach has been widely used in
thinking about inequality and justice.
The literature that develops the relevance of the capability approach
in theories of justice falls primarily within the domain of normative
political philosophy, but there is some overlap with the work done by
welfare economists and other scholars. In order to get a grip on what
the capability approach does in the literature on distributive justice, or,
vice versa, what thinking goes on about theories of distributive justice
within the capability literature, let us start with a brief primer on the
theoretical literature on justice in the next section. Then, in section
3.13.2, I pose the question of what is required for the construction of a
complete capability theory of justice. The final section, 3.13.3, explores
the implications of a capability-based approach to justice in practice.
19	In particular, see the overview of different types of capability study in section 2.4.

3.13.1 A brief description of the literature
on theories of justice
Justice is an essentially contested concept: there is no generally accepted
definition of justice, and thus no consensus on what the appropriate
subject matter of theories of justice is or should be. Of course, it does not
follow that nothing at all can be said about the notion of justice. David
Miller’s description of social justice is a good starting point. He claims
that when arguing about justice, we are discussing:
how the good and bad things in life should be distributed among the
members of a human society. When, more concretely, we attack some
policy or some state of affairs as socially unjust, we are claiming that a
person, or more usually a category of persons, enjoys fewer advantages
than that person or group of persons ought to enjoy (or bears more of
the burdens than they ought to bear), given how other members of the
society in question are faring. (Miller 1999, 1)

Theories of justice do not cover the entire spectrum of moral issues.
Social justice theorists generally agree that parts of morality fall outside
the scope of justice. Charity is such a case: you may not have a duty
of justice to help a frail, elderly neighbour, but you may nevertheless
decide to help that person as an act of charity and compassion. Another
example is morally laudable behaviour, such as being a volunteer for
social activities in your neighbourhood. Such behaviour may be morally
praiseworthy, but it may at the same time not be required as a matter of
justice. Hence, justice is not all that matters, if we consider how to make
the world morally better.
Can we describe justice, and theories of justice, by their properties, as
philosophers often do? First, justice is a property that has been ascribed
to both individuals and institutions: justice is a virtue of individuals
in their interactions with others, and justice is also a virtue of social
institutions (Barry and Matravers 2011). Thus, we can say that a certain
society is more or less just, or we can say that the behaviour of some
persons is just or unjust. Theorists of justice tend primarily to discuss
the justice of social arrangements, that is, of social institutions broadly
defined; justice as an individual virtue is sometimes regarded as a
matter of ethics rather than of political philosophy (although not every
political philosopher would agree with this way of demarcating justice

3. Clarifications



149

from ethics). Moreover, an increasing number of theorists define social
institutions more broadly so as to include societal structures related to
class or caste, as well as social norms; under such broad definitions,
conceptualising justice as a virtue of institutions touches upon many of
the same aspects we would discuss if we were to see justice as a virtue of
persons. For example, if a society has widely shared racist social norms,
such as the disapproval of interracial love relationships, then a person
who shows her disapproval of an interracial love relationship is acting
upon an unjust social norm, but also showing non-virtuous behaviour.
Second, while sometimes the terms ‘social justice’ and ‘distributive
justice’ are used as synonyms, it makes sense to understand ‘social
justice’ as somewhat broader than ‘distributive justice’. Distributive
justice always deals with an analysis of who gets what, whereas social
justice may also relate to questions of respect or recognition, or the
attitudes that a certain institution expresses. The capability approach
is mainly discussed in theories of distributive justice, although it is to
some extent able to integrate the concerns of theorists of recognition
about what they conceive to be the narrow or mistaken focus of theories
of distributive justice.20
A third point to note about the literature on justice is that there
are several different schools within social justice theories. According
to Brian Barry and Matt Matravers, it is helpful to classify theories
of social justice according to four types: conventionalism, teleology,
justice as mutual advantage and egalitarian justice. Conventionalism is
the view that issues of justice can be resolved by examining how local
conventions, institutions, traditions and systems of law determine the
divisions of burdens and benefits. Barry and Matravers rightly point out
that this approach, which has been defended by Michael Walzer (1983),
can lead to the acceptance of grossly unjust practices because they are
generally endorsed by certain communities, even if they may be seen as
unjust if judged on the basis of values and ideas not currently present (or
dominant) in that society. Teleology is the view that social arrangements
should be justified by referring to some good they are aiming for. Some
examples are utilitarianism, natural law theory or Aquinas’ Christian
20	It doesn’t follow that all concerns of theorists of recognition are best expressed by
using the capability approach. I doubt that this is the case, but will not pursue this
issue here further.

150

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

philosophy. For teleological theories, what justice is follows from an
account of the good, and thus the account of justice depends on the
account of the social good itself. A criticism of teleological theories is that
they necessarily rely on an external source (to specify what ‘the good’ is),
such as utility, the natural law or God’s authority. Teleological accounts
of justice therefore necessarily depend on notions of the ultimate good.
However, in pluralistic societies characterised by a variety of religious
and non-religious worldviews, it is hard to see how justice can be
derived from notions of the good that are not endorsed by all. Many
contemporary political philosophers therefore argue that teleological
theories cannot be defended since people have competing ideas of the
good, and we cannot call upon a generally-accepted external source that
will tell us which idea of the good should be imposed on all.
The third and fourth schools of social justice, in comparison, share a
commitment to some form of liberalism that recognizes the diversity of
views of the good life, which a just society should respect. These schools
experienced a major revival after the publication of John Rawls’s A
Theory of Justice in 1971, which is generally regarded as the single most
important work on social justice written in the last century.21 Rawls
turned to the social contract tradition, in which justice is understood as
the fair distribution of benefits of social cooperation. The core idea is
that rules of justice are ultimately more beneficial to everyone than if
each were to pursue their own advantage by themselves. Some of these
theories (though not Rawls’s!) take the relative power or bargaining
strength of every individual in society as given, and one may therefore
question whether in situations of unequal bargaining power, justice
will be done (Nussbaum 2006b). The other liberal school of justice is
egalitarian justice, which is premised on the idea that people should be
treated with equal respect and concern (Dworkin 2000). The most basic
claim of those theories is that people are morally equal: each person
should be treated as a being of equal moral worth. However, that
21	There is a large literature on the differences and complementarities between the
capability approach to justice (that is, capabilitarian theories of justice) and Rawls’s
theory of justice (see e.g. Sen 1980, 195–200; Rawls 1988; Sen 1992a, 82–83; Pogge
2002; Nussbaum 2006b; Robeyns 2008b, 2009; and the contributions to Brighouse
and Robeyns 2010).

general and abstract claim can be further developed in many different
ways, and it is in specifying these further details that philosophers
disagree. Distributive justice requires equality of something, but not
necessarily equality of outcome in material terms (in fact, plain equality
of resources is a claim very few theorists of justice would be willing
to defend, since people have different needs, are confronted with
different circumstances and, if given the same opportunities, are likely
to make different use of them). Hence, Rawls’s theory of justice can be
seen as an egalitarian theory of justice, but so are theories that come to
very different substantive conclusions, such as Robert Nozick’s (1974)
entitlement theory. Other major contemporary theorists of justice who
can be labelled ‘liberal egalitarian’ are Brian Barry (1995), Philippe Van
Parijs (1995), and Ronald Dworkin (2000), among many others.
Of those four schools, it is primarily liberal egalitarian theories that are
discussed in relation to the capability approach. While there is internal
diversity within this group of liberal egalitarian theories, these theories
share the commitment to the principle that there should be considerable
(although by no means absolute) scope for individuals to determine
their own life plan and notion of the good, as well as a commitment
to a notion of equal moral consideration, which is another way to put
the principle of each person as an end, or normative individualism (see
section 2.6.8).
Of the four schools of social justice, only the last two regard justice
and equality as being closely related values. Under conventionalism,
justice is guided by existing traditions, conventions and institutions,
even if those existing practices do not treat people as equals in a
plausible sense. Teleological theories also do not understand justice
as entailing some notion of equality; instead, the idea of the good is
more important, even if it implies that people are not treated as moral
equals. In some theories of conventionalism and teleology, social justice
could be consistent with a notion of equality, but this is not necessarily
the case for all these theories. The social contract tradition and liberal
egalitarianism, in contrast, derive their principles of social justice from
a fundamental idea of people as moral equals. However, the notion of
equal moral worth does not necessarily lead to the notion of equality of
resources or another type of equality of outcome, as will be explained

152

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

in what follows. Social justice and equality are related in these theories,
but not always at the level of material inequality, but rather at a more
fundamental level of treating people as moral equals or with equal
respect and concern.
For a proper understanding of mainstream philosophical literature
on theories of justice, it is helpful to know that the literature itself is
highly abstract, and often rather detached from questions about policy
design or political feasibility. Sen (2006, 2009c) has recently criticised
such theories, and in particular Rawls’s work, for being overly
“transcendental”. Such ideal theories give an account of the perfectly
just society, but do not tell us what needs to be done to get closer to
that very ideal, how we can make the world less unjust and which of
two situations might be more unjust than the other. Another critique of
contemporary theories of justice is that they are often based on so-called
idealisations or strong assumptions, which may introduce significant
biases or exclude certain groups of people from the theory. For example,
Dworkin (2000) sets his egalitarian theory against a set of background
assumptions that rule out racist and sexist attitudes and behaviours,
as well as the adaptation of preferences to unfair circumstances (Pierik
and Robeyns 2007). Certain assumptions and meta-theoretical as well
as methodological choices also put philosophical theories of justice at
risk of being too far removed from practical applicability. When we
try to apply contemporary theories of justice to the actual reality of
our chaotic and often messy world, there are all sorts of complications
that need to be taken into account, such as trade-offs between different
values, power imbalances between different social groups, unintended
consequences of justice-enhancing interventions and policies, or interests
of individuals and groups that may conflict with concerns for justice
(e.g. a desire for re-election on the part of government administrations).
Debates about the practical relevance of contemporary philosophical
theories of justice have gained momentum in the last decade. It remains
unclear whether the outcome will change the way theories of justice are
constructed in the future. It may well be that we will see a turn towards
more non-ideal, empirically-informed, ‘directly useful’ theories that are
easier to translate into practice. In any case, it is fair to say that most
capability theorists working on justice are among those who strongly
advocate this turn to make theories of justice more relevant to practice.

3.13.2 What do we need for a capability theory of justice?
In the previous section I gave a very brief account of the philosophical
literature on theories of justice. What contribution can the capability
approach make to this field? The first thing to note is that Martha
Nussbaum has written at great length developing a capabilities theory
of justice (e.g. Nussbaum 1988, 1992, Nussbaum 2000, 2002a; Nussbaum
2006b). Her capabilities theory is the most detailed capability theory of
justice that has been developed up till now. Her theory is comprehensive,
in the sense that it is not limited to an account of political justice, or to
liberal democracies. Her account holds for all human beings on earth,
independently of whether they are living in a liberal democratic regime,
or of whether they are severely disabled. However, Nussbaum’s theory
of social justice doesn’t amount to a full theory of social justice. The
main demarcation of Nussbaum’s account is that it provides only “a
partial and minimal account of social justice” (Nussbaum 2006b, 71)
by specifying thresholds of a list of capabilities that governments in all
nations should guarantee to their citizens. Nussbaum’s theory focuses
on thresholds, but this does not imply that reaching these thresholds is
all that matters for social justice; rather, her theory is partial and simply
doesn’t discuss the question of what social justice requires once those
thresholds are met. Not discussing certain things is not necessarily a
flaw of a theory: this may be theoretical work that Nussbaum will do
in the future, or it may be work that will be done by other scholars.
Moreover, it is quite possible that Nussbaum’s account of partial justice
is consistent with several accounts of what justice requires above the
thresholds.
Yet, while Nussbaum’s theory of justice has been worked out in
great detail and has received a lot of attention, it would be a grave
mistake to think that there can be only one capability theory of justice.
On the contrary, the open nature of the capability framework allows
for the development of a family of capability theories of justice. This
then prompts the question: what is needed if we want to create such a
capability theory of justice?22

22	I have presented this overview of steps that need to be taken in earlier publications
(e.g. Robeyns 2016d).

154

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

First, a theory of justice needs to explain on what basis it justifies
its principles or claims of justice. For example, Rawls uses the method
of reflective equilibrium, including the thought experiment of the
original position.23 Dworkin’s egalitarian justice theory starts from the
meta-principle of equal respect and concern, which he then develops in
the principles that the distribution of burdens and benefits should be
sensitive to the ambitions that people have but should not reflect the
unequal natural endowments with which individuals are born (Dworkin
1981, 2000). One could also develop a capability theory of justice arguing
that the ultimate driving force is a concern with agency (Claassen and
Düwell 2013; Claassen 2016) or with human dignity (Nussbaum 2000;
Nussbaum 2006b). If capability scholars want to develop a full theory
of justice, they will also need to explain on what bases they justify their
principles or claims. As mentioned earlier, Nussbaum starts from a
notion of human dignity, whereas the Senian strand in the capability
approach stresses the importance of what people have reason to value,
hence an account of public reasoning. However, little work has been
done so far to flesh out this embryonic idea of ‘having reason to value’,
and it therefore remains unclear whether the capability approach has
a solid unified rationale on the basis of which a full account of justice
could be developed.
Second, as indicated above, in developing a capability theory of
justice we must decide whether we want it to be an outcome or an
opportunity theory; that is, whether we think that we should assess
injustices in terms of functionings, or rather in terms of capabilities,
or a mixture. At the level of theory and principles, most theorists of
justice endorse the view that justice is done if all have equal genuine
opportunities, or if all reach a minimal threshold of capability levels.
Translated to the capability language, this would imply that at the level
of theory and principles, capabilities are the relevant metric of justice,
and not functionings. However, among theorists of justice, not everyone
subscribes to this view. Anne Phillips (2004) has been a prominent
voice arguing for equality of outcome, rather than opportunities. In
the capability literature, Marc Fleurbaey (2002) has argued against an
approach that takes only capabilities into account and has defended a
23	An accessible explanation of the method of reflective equilibrium can be found in
Knight (2017).

3. Clarifications



155

focus on ‘refined functionings’ (being the combination of functionings
and capabilities).
A third issue which needs to be solved if one hopes to develop a
capability theory of justice is to decide and justify which capabilities
matter the most. There are at least two ways of answering this question:
either through procedural approaches, such as using criteria from
which the relevant capabilities are derived, or by defending a specific
list of capabilities. This selection of relevant capabilities for the purpose
of justice can be done at the level of ideal theory (without taking issues
of practical feasibility and implementation into account), at the level of
abstract principles (Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2006b; Claassen 2016) or
at an applied theoretical level, which is useful for practical assessments
of unjust inequalities (e.g. Robeyns 2003; Wolff and De-Shalit 2007).
Fourth, a capability theory of justice may need to engage in a
comparison with other ‘metrics of justice’. In the literature on social
justice there are several terms used to indicate what precisely we are
assessing or measuring: the metric of advantage, the currency of justice,
or the informational basis for the interpersonal comparisons for the
purpose of justice. Within theories of justice, the main arguments are with
Rawlsian resourcists24 and with defenders of Dworkinian resourcism.25
Other possible metrics are basic needs or the many different types of
subjective welfare or preference satisfaction. A full capability theory of
justice would need to show why it serves better as a metric of justice
than these other metrics.
Fifth, a capability theory of justice needs to take a position on the
“distributive rule” (Anderson 2010, 81) that it will endorse: will it argue
for plain equality, or for sufficiency, or for prioritarianism, or for some
other (mixed) distributive rule? Both Martha Nussbaum’s and Elizabeth
Anderson’s theories are sufficiency accounts, but from this it does not
follow, as one sometimes reads in the secondary literature, that the
capability approach entails a sufficiency rule. Sen may have given the
(wrong) impression of defending straight equality as a distributive rule,
24	An analysis of this comparison between social primary goods and capabilities was
made by the various contributions to the volume edited by Brighouse and Robeyns
(2010).
25	For comparisons of the capability view with Dworkin’s egalitarian theory, see Sen
(1984b, 321–23, 2009c, 264–68); Dworkin (2000, 299–303); Williams (2002); Browne
and Stears (2005); Kaufman (2006); Pierik and Robeyns (2007).

156

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

by asking the question “Equality of what?” (Sen 1980), though a careful
reading shows that he was merely asking the question “If we want to
be defending equality of something, then what would that be?” In fact,
Sen has remained uncommitted to one single distributive rule, which
probably can be explained by the fact that he is averse to building a welldefined theory of justice but rather prefers to investigate how real-life
unjust situations can be turned into more just situations, even if perfect
justice is unattainable (Sen 2006, 2009c). The capability approach clearly
plays a role in Sen’s work on justice, since when assessing a situation,
he will investigate inequalities in people’s capabilities and analyse the
processes that led to those inequalities. Yet Sen has an eclectic approach
to theorizing, and hence other notions and theories (such as human rights
or more formal discussions on freedoms from social choice theory) also
play a role in his work on justice. The presence and importance of the
capability approach in Sen’s work is thus undeniable, but should not be
seen as the only defining feature.
Sixth, a capability theory of justice needs to specify where the line
between individual and collective responsibility is drawn, or how this
will be decided, and by whom. There is a remarkable absence of any
discussion about issues of responsibility in the capability literature, in
sharp contrast to political philosophy and welfare economics where
this is one of the most important lines of debate, certainly since the
publication of Dworkin’s (1981, 2000) work on justice and equality
which led to what Anderson (1999) has called “luck-egalitarianism”.
Nevertheless, whether one wants to discuss it explicitly or not, any
concrete capability policy proposal can be analysed in terms of the
division between personal and collective responsibility, but this
terminology is largely absent from the capability literature. In part, this
might be explained by the fact that much of the work on capabilities
deals with global poverty, where issues of individual responsibility
seem to be less relevant since it would seem outrageous to suggest that
the world’s most destitute people are personally responsible for the
situation they are in. That doesn’t mean that the responsibility question
is not important: it is indeed of utmost importance to ask who is
responsible for global poverty reduction or the fulfilling of international
development targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals on
which political philosophers have written a great deal (Singer 2004,

3. Clarifications



157

2010; Pogge 2008). The point is rather that philosophical puzzles, such
as the issue of expensive tastes (for expensive wine, caviar, fast cars, or
you name it), are simply beyond the radar of the child labourer or the
poor peasant. However, while this may perhaps justify the absence of
any discussion about personal responsibility among capability scholars
concerned with poverty, it does not absolve theorists of justice who deal
with justice in affluent societies (or affluent sections of poor societies)
from discussing the just division between personal and collective
responsibility (Pierik and Robeyns 2007, 148–49).
This brings us to a related issue: a theory of justice generally specifies
rights, but also duties. However, capability theorists have remained
largely silent on the question of whose duty it is to expand the selected
capabilities. Nussbaum passionately advocates that all people all over
the world should be entitled, as a matter of justice, to threshold levels
of all the capabilities on her list, but apart from mentioning that it is the
governments’ duty to guarantee these entitlements (Nussbaum 2006b,
70), she remains silent on the question of who precisely should bear
the burdens and responsibilities for realizing these capabilities. Yet as
Onora O’Neill (1996, 122–53) has argued, questions of obligations and
responsibilities should be central to any account of justice.
This section makes clear that a capability theory of justice is
theoretically much more demanding than the basic presupposition of
the capability approach that ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’ are the
best metric for most kinds of interpersonal evaluations. While much has
been written on the capability approach in recent years by an increasing
number of scholars, including philosophers, much of the philosophical
work needed for turning the open-ended capability approach into a
specific theory of justice remains to be done.
Note, however, that not all capability theorists working on issues
of justice believe that such a fully worked-out theory is required. Sen
(2009c) himself has argued at length that we don’t need a theory that
describes a utopian ideal, but rather we need theorising to help us with
making comparisons of injustice, and to guide us towards a less unjust
society. Similarly, Jay Drydyk (2012) has argued that the capability
approach to justice should focus on reducing capability shortfalls, for
which a utopian account of perfect justice is not needed. Some capability
theorists may want to work out a full theory of justice by addressing the

158

various specifications outlined above, while others may want to change
the very nature of theorising about justice, moving it more to applied,
non-ideal or grounded theories (Watene and Drydyk 2016).

3.13.3 From theories of justice to
just practices and policies
Before closing this section on capabilitarian theorizing about justice,
let us briefly shift from theory to practice. Since theories of justice are
mainly developed at a highly abstract level, often entailing ideals of
perfect justice, we may wonder whether the capability approach to social
justice and equality is of any use in telling us what justice-enhancing
strategies and policies to develop. Indeed, this has sometimes been
phrased as a serious concern, namely, that theories of justice are too
abstract and do not help us with social justice struggles on the ground.
One may well argue that we roughly know what is going wrong and
we need political action rather than more and more detailed theorising.
Moreover, some think that in the real world the subtleties of theories
of justice are easily abused in order to justify gross inequalities, as
may have been the case with philosophical discussions on individual
responsibility. For example, Brian Barry’s (2005) later work exemplified
this concern with the direct application of theories of justice to political
change and the reform of the welfare state, rather than with further
philosophical refinements of theories of justice. Related charges have
been aimed at the capability approach as well. For instance, it has
been argued that not enough attention has been paid to issues of social
power in the capability writings on justice, and Feldman and Gellert
(2006) have underscored the importance of recognising the struggles
and negotiations by dominated and disadvantaged groups if social
justice is ever to be realised. Such questions of power politics, effective
social criticism, successful collective action, historical and cultural
sensitivities, and the negotiation of competing interests are indeed
largely absent from the philosophical literature on theories of justice.
These ideal theories develop standards of a just society, but often do not
tell us what institutions or policies are necessary if just societies are to be
constructed, nor do they tell us what social and political processes will
help advocates implement these social changes in concrete ways.

But the capability approach can be linked to more concrete justiceenhancing policy proposals that have been developed. For one thing,
the Millennium Development Goals could be understood as being a
practical (albeit specific and also limited) translation of the capability
approach in practice, and their successors, the Sustainable Development
Goals, can also be seen as influenced by the capability approach.26 In
fact, at the level of severe global poverty, any concrete poverty-reduction
strategy which conceptualises poverty in a capability sense is, for most
accounts of justice, a concrete justice-enhancing strategy, since these
theories would include the absence of severe poverty as a principle of
justice.
If we move from the area of poverty-reduction strategies to the
question of just social policies in countries or regions with higher levels
of affluence, we observe that there are much fewer actual examples
of justice-enhancing policies that have been explicitly grounded in, or
associated with, the capability approach. Yet many concrete policies
and interventions could be interpreted as such, or are consistent with
the capability perspective itself. One example relates to a policy of
providing, regulating and/or subsidising child-care facilities. This can
arguably be justified as a prerequisite for gender justice in capabilities
since, due to gender norms, women will in effect not be able to develop
themselves professionally if they are not supported in their need for
decent quality-regulated (and possibly subsidised) child-care facilities.
Mothers at home may be materially well-off if their husbands earn a
good income but, if they do not have the genuine opportunity to hold
jobs, then their capability sets are severely constrained and gender justice
in capabilities cannot be achieved. An income metric which assumes
equal sharing in the household may not detect any moral problem, but
a capability metric will claim that women have more limited freedoms
than men, since the provisions are not there to ensure that both parents
can hold jobs, and gender norms and other gendered social mechanisms
make it highly unlikely that men will volunteer to stay at home with
their children. At the same time, men are also losing out since they have
a very limited capability to spend time with their newborn babies.

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

A slightly different example concerns a justice-enhancing
intervention that can be found in the form of adult volunteers who visit
disadvantaged families to read to the children in order to enhance their
language skills.27 It is well-known that many children of immigrants are
disadvantaged at school since they are very likely to enter school with
weaker knowledge of the language of instruction than non-immigrant
children. For this reason, in several cities there are networks of volunteers
to read books to small immigrant children in their own homes. In this
way, they effectively reduce the gap in educational opportunity between
immigrant children and non-immigrant children. This example also
illustrates that justice-enhancing strategies are not confined to public
policy, but can also be initiated by persons and groups at the grassroots.
The government is not the only agent of justice; we can all do our part.

3.14 Capabilities and human rights
Several capability theories are closely related to accounts of human
rights. Within the capability literature, some scholars have developed
capability theories that they regard as a human rights theory. In the
human rights literature, scholars have examined to what extent the
capability approach can help to develop stronger theories of human
rights. The same topics (e.g. provision of or right to basic health or basic
education) are defended based on both approaches, or are defended
appealing both to human rights and capabilities (e.g. Osmani 2000).
Amartya Sen has in several of his publications analysed the relationship
between human rights and capabilities (e.g. Sen 2004b, 2005). In
addition, Martha Nussbaum has claimed that her capabilities theory is a
version of human rights theory, which has drawn much attention to the
question about the relationship between capabilities and human rights.
It should not be surprising that there are so many scholars and
practitioners interested in both the human rights framework and the
capability approach, since they share some important aspects. First,
they are both widely endorsed ethical frameworks. Second, they seem
to share an underlying motivation, namely to protect and enhance
27	In the Netherlands, this volunteer organisation is called De Voorleesexpress (https://
voorleesexpress.nl) but similar initiatives must exist around the world.

3. Clarifications

161

people’s freedoms. Third, they are both used for global as well as
domestic questions. Fourth, both frameworks want to build strong links
between theory and practice: they are studied and used by scholars but
also used by practitioners (political parties, activists, policy makers,
etc.). Finally, both discourses are strongly interdisciplinary in nature.
All this raises some questions. What is the relationship between
human rights and capabilities? Can we say that capabilities are the
objects of human rights? If so, do human rights theories and analyses
have something to gain by developing capabilities-based human rights
theories? Can the capability approach deliver all that is important in
human rights theories? And what should we make of the alleged
disadvantages of using the capability approach in thinking about
human rights?

3.14.1 What are human rights?
Human rights are rights each human being is entitled to in order to
protect her from severe harms that could be inflicted by others — either
by deliberate actions, or else by the failure to protect human rights
caused by institutional design. They are norms aimed at protecting
people from severe social, political and legal abuse (Nickel 2014, 1).
Examples of human rights are the right to life, the right to food, the
right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of religion, the right
to a fair trial when charged with a crime, the right not to be tortured,
and the right to privacy.
Human rights are not all the rights that people have. As Sen
(2004b, 329) writes, “there have to be some ‘threshold conditions’ of (i)
importance and (ii) social influenceability for a freedom to figure within
the interpersonal and interactive spectrum of human rights”. Take the
‘importance threshold’ first. Here is an example of a right that is not
a human right, because it does not meet the threshold condition of
importance: the right to parental leave. In many European countries,
parents who are employed have a right to paid parental leave upon
the birth of their child or when they adopt a child. While many have
argued that such a right would help meet our duties towards children
and parents as well as advance gender justice (e.g. Gheaus and Robeyns
2011), it is not at all plausible to argue that this should be seen as a

162

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

human right. It has a much weaker moral urgency than the right to a fair
trial, let alone the right to life. Human rights thus correspond to a subset
of the domain of justice, and focus on those questions that are of utter
importance, the protection of which should have a greater urgency than
the support of other normative claims. The second threshold — social
influenceability — implies that even if something valuable is hugely
important, as long as there is no or very limited social influenceability,
its protection cannot be a human right. For example, it makes no sense
to speak of a human right to be protected from volcano eruptions, or
a human right to be protected from cancer. However, one can say that
there is a human right to be warned about volcano eruptions if the
government has the relevant information. To the extent that there is
more social influenceability, the scope to speak coherently of human
rights increases.
Human rights have corresponding duties. But on whom do those
duties fall and what kind of duties are they? A broad, inclusive account
of duties is given by Pablo Gilabert (2009, 673) who writes:
[Human rights impose] a duty of the highest priority for individuals
and governments to identify ways to protect certain important interests
through (a) specific rights and entitlements, but also, when these
are insufficient or not presently feasible, through (b) urgent goals of
institution-building.

Note that this definition does not limit the duty to protect human rights
to governments only, and that it does include institution-building as an
important path towards protecting human rights.28

3.14.2 The interdisciplinary scholarship on human rights
The human rights literature is, just like the capability approach, deeply
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. The philosophy of human rights
“addresses questions about the existence, content, nature, universality,
justification, and legal status of human rights” (Nickel 2014, 1). How
can human rights exist in the first place? What should be the content of
28	This relates to a complex discussion in legal and political philosophy on whether
human rights can be protected by so-called ‘imperfect duties’ or ‘imperfect
obligations’ which is beyond the scope of this book. See, amongst others, Polly
Vizard (2006, 84–91) and Frances Kamm (2011) for further discussion.

3. Clarifications

163

human rights, that is, what kinds of harms or abuses should they protect
us from? What kind of rights are human rights — are they moral claims,
or legal claims, or political claims, or something else? The question
of justification asks: on what grounds can we say that people have
human rights? Is it because humans have rational capacities or agency?
If so, does that mean that newborn babies do not have human rights?
All these questions are studied in the vast philosophical literature on
human rights.
Note that while the relationship between normative political
philosophy, justice and human rights is not entirely disputed, the
dominant view in the contemporary literature is that the domain of
human rights is a subset of the domain of justice, which in turn is a
subset of the domain of morality. The reason is that “[n]ot everything
that is desirable to be realized in politics is a matter of human rights,
and not everything that is a matter of justice is a matter of human rights.
Human rights constitute the most urgent demand of basic global justice”
(Gilabert 2009, 676).
Legal scholars are interested in questions related to the treaties and
constitutions in which human rights are codified. The idea of human
rights gained momentum with the 1948 adoption of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which over time received a
canonical status in legal and political debates. The UDHR subsequently
served as a template for human rights instruments that are legally
binding, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
the European Convention on Human Rights, the American Convention
on Human Rights and the African Charter of Human and People’s
Rights. One question this raises is to what extent national constitutions
are consistent with those legally binding treaties, or with the UDHR.
Another question frequently asked by legal scholars is to what extent
national jurisprudence can be in tension with — and violate — a human
right that is part of an international treaty to which that particular
nation signed up. For example, in the famous ‘Lautsi case’, the question
emerged whether the Italian state’s policy to have a compulsory crucifix
in the classroom of public schools was in violation of the human right
to the freedom of religion as codified in the European Convention on
Human Rights (Weiler 2010; Pierik 2012; Pierik and van der Burg 2011).

164

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

In the social sciences and international relations, questions are asked
about what role human rights play in politics. How do countries differ
in the degree in which they protect human rights? What are the effective
instruments that support human rights in countries in which they are
not violated? Is it effective to condemn human rights violations in other
countries, or is silent support for grassroots human rights activists a
more effective strategy?
Of course, human rights are hugely important for human right
activists, who are working on actual human rights protections. Other
activists, such as those focusing on the empowerment of disadvantaged
groups, often take a more instrumental attitude towards human rights,
and ask whether such rights are effective instruments to reach their
goals of inclusion, development and combatting forms of injustice and
oppression.

3.14.3 Why a capability-based account of human rights?
After this brief sketch of the huge literature on human rights, we can
now explore the relation between human rights and capabilities. The
first question that needs to be asked is: why would we be at all interested
in a capabilities-based theory of human rights? What could be gained by
theorizing human rights, or trying to protect human rights, by referring
to capabilities?
The first reason is philosophical, and concerns the justification
of human rights. Human rights are norms or instruments to protect
certain valuable things (which are called ‘the objects of human rights’).
But every time we claim an object is so important its protection must
be enshrined as a human right, we must argue why that object has this
special importance. Part of the philosophical literature on capabilities
does precisely that — to justify why we need to protect certain valuable
personal states. Both Sen (2004b, 2005) and Nussbaum (1997, 2011a)
have argued that human rights can be seen as entitlements to certain
capabilities. However, Sen’s views are more qualified, since he has
argued that the object of some but not necessarily all human rights
can be viewed as capabilities. There are plausibly also other objects of
human rights, such as process freedoms and liberties.
The second reason builds on the first. If some human rights
can be understood in terms of capabilities, and poverty can also be

3. Clarifications



165

conceptualized in terms of the denial of capabilities, then poverty can
be conceptualized as a human rights violation (Osmani 2005). This is
important for various reasons, including the strong rhetorical force that
a human rights violation has in comparison with other claims, and also
because socio-economic human rights have sometimes been regarded
as more in need of conceptual foundations, in comparison with the civic
and political human rights whose status as human rights has been less
contested.
This relates to the third reason why it can be helpful to conceptualise
human rights in terms of capabilities, which is the often-stated worry
that the protection of human rights, especially social and economic
rights, is infeasible (Gilabert 2009). To counter that pessimism, we need
greater clarity on the chain of steps that are involved in socio-economic
human rights protection. Capabilities are the objects of our rights, and
we know, from our understanding of how capabilities relate to resources
and social structures, which parameters can influence the capabilities
that people enjoy (see the figure in section 2.12). Hence, if we want to
protect human rights, in particular socio-economic rights, which sceptics
believe cannot effectively be protected, the capability approach helps
us see that “promoting socioeconomic rights may require attention
to specific parameters that affect the capabilities of people” (Gilabert
2009, 666). In sum, the language of the capability approach helps us to
respond and address the feasibility worry of socio-economic rights.
Fourthly, we are unsure whether some things we want to protect
meet the threshold condition of importance that human rights should
meet. If one is unsure about whether a certain freedom should be a right,
let alone a human right, one could already start to protect or enhance it if
one sees it as a capability. One does not need to wait until the discussion
about the threshold is settled before one starts to protect something that
everyone agrees is in any case important.
A final reason is more practical or political. In some countries, the
terminology of ‘human rights’ is regarded with suspicion, as it is seen as
stemming from a colonial era, and, as a consequence, is regarded as an
instrument of western domination. This makes it hard for both local and
global advocates of human rights to advance their cause. By using the
terminology of capabilities, which is not linked to a particular colonial
era or western power, instead of the language of human rights, these
same valuable rights can be argued for.

166

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

3.14.4 Are capabilities sufficient to construct
a theory of human rights?
There is quite a lot of interest among capability scholars and those
working in the human development paradigm to try to bring the best
of the capability approach and the human rights approach together (e.g.
Vizard 2006, 2007; Vizard, Fukuda‐Parr and Elson 2011; Fukuda-Parr
2011; Gilabert 2009, 2013). One important question, though, is how much
the capability approach can offer if one is interested in constructing a
powerful human rights theory. Is the notion of capabilities sufficient for
such a theory?
The answer clearly must be negative. A theory of human rights needs
other elements, such as a discussion of the scope of, and, importantly,
the justification for, human rights. Yet, by making use of the distinction
between the capability approach and capability theories that was
introduced in section 2.3, we can see that it is not at all an embarrassment
for the capability approach that, by itself, it cannot deliver a theory of
human rights. Instead, that should be the task of a specific capability
theory, for which, in the various modules, additional elements that are
needed for a human rights theory can be added.
This raises the next question: what would have to be added, then?
One important thing that may need to be added (in A6 — other
dimensions of ultimate value) are process freedoms. Sen (2004b) argues
that we should make a distinction between freedoms as substantive
opportunities and the process aspect of freedom (procedural aspects).
Both are, in his view, relevant when thinking about human rights, but
only the opportunity aspect of freedom is captured by the notion of
‘capabilities’. Linda Barclay (2016) makes a similar point, by saying that
rights that concern equitable processes are very important for human rights,
and cannot be captured by the notion of capabilities. Clearly, procedural
characteristics, for example those that guarantee a free trial, may not
necessarily best be understood as capabilities, but perhaps rather more
as elements of institutional design. Yet as proposition A6 emphasizes,
not everything that is of crucial importance is a capability. Recall that
proposition A6 allows us to include other elements of ultimate value,
and this could incorporate what Sen calls process freedoms.29 In short, by
29	The example that Barclay gives is the right not to be discriminated against. Barclay
believes that “to be protected from discrimination” is a very important human

3. Clarifications



167

seeing a capability-based human rights theory as a capability theory, for
which various theoretical additions and choices are possible, it becomes
clear that more is needed than the mere reference to ‘capabilities’.
Note also that we can, of course, ask the question the other way
around — what is needed to make a capability theory? — and use the
human rights framework as the theory of value that is used to make the
selection of capabilities. This route has been developed by Polly Vizard,
and has led to the “human rights based capability set” (Vizard 2006,
2007).

3.14.5 The disadvantages
Finally, we need to ask whether there are any disadvantages in using the
capability approach to further our thinking, policy making and activism
on human rights, and — ultimately — in letting a capabilities-based
human rights theory compete with the existing human rights accounts.
The first thing to note is that there is a long-standing human rights
discourse that is used by activists all over the world, and often very
effectively so. Clearly there are costs involved for these activists to
become familiarized with the capability language. If the human rights
discourse delivers to them what they need, why would we change it?
Second, there is a worry about legitimacy. The current human rights
declarations and treaties have been the result of actual political processes,
and the treaties were drafted by a large number of people, drawn from
all over the world. For the capability approach, this is different. Given
the prominence of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, and also the
many publications that (wrongly) reduce the capability approach to
the work by, primarily, Sen and Nussbaum,30 the capability approach
is much more associated with specific individuals. A capability-based
human rights theory that is the work of one thinker can never have the
political leverage that the existing human rights framework has. For the

right, but cannot plausibly be conceptualized as a capability, since one does not
have a choice to be discriminated against or not. However, not being discriminated
against is a functioning, and it is a mistake to think that the capability approach
holds that we should only focus on capabilities and never on functionings, as was
argued in section 3.4.
30	Unfortunately, Nussbaum’s (2011c) account of the capability approach only adds to
that reductive and misleading portrayal of the capability literature (Robeyns 2011,
2016b; Unterhalter 2013).

168

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

various practices in which human rights are used (creating laws, making
policy and activism) a capability-based human rights framework can
therefore never replace the existing human rights framework.
However, there is, of course, a more fruitful relationship possible,
and that is to see the two frameworks as complementary rather than
competitive (Nussbaum 2011a). Note, however, that any merging of
the two frameworks has to be between a particular capability theory
and human rights thinking, rather than between the general capability
approach and human rights thinking.31 A good example of such
practical work is the UK’s Equality and Human Rights Framework.
Tania Burchardt and Polly Vizard (2011) used insights from both the
capability approach and the existing work on human rights to create a
framework that is used for the monitoring undertaken by the Equality
and Human Rights Commission in order to meet its legal mandate.32

3.15 Conclusion
The aim of this chapter has been to deepen our understanding of the
capability approach, by analysing some questions of clarification
that are often posed, and by reconstructing and synthesizing some
developments that have taken place in the capability literature over
time.
The next chapter will focus on a range of critiques that have been
put to the capability approach. Of course, it is not always entirely clear
whether a certain question or debate is purely a matter of clarification,
or rather a matter of debate and dispute; put differently, there is no neat
demarcation between the main focus of this chapter and that of the next.
Still, in this chapter I have tried to be as neutral and even-handed as
possible in describing the literature, whereas in the next chapter I will
take a more active role in arguing for or against certain views or claims.

31	Hence, when Nussbaum (2011a, 24) writes “the CA is a type of human rights
approach”, we should read this as “Martha Nussbaum’s capability theory is a
type of human rights approach”. Many other capability theories are, evidently, not
human rights approaches, and hence the capability approach, as the overarching
framework, cannot be either.

4. Critiques and Debates

4.1 Introduction
In chapter 2 I gave an account of the capability approach that gave us
a better sense of its necessary core and its scope, as well as describing
the structure of a capability theory or capability analysis. While that
account has aimed to be precise and comprehensive, it nevertheless
raises some further issues.
Hence, this chapter is focussed on investigating those further
questions and debates. We will look into the following issues. Section
4.2 asks whether everything that has been called a capability in the
literature is genuinely so. Section 4.3 addresses a dispute that has kept
capability theorists busy for quite a while over the last two decades,
namely whether a capability theorist should endorse a specific list
of capabilities. For many years, this was debated under the banner
‘the question of the list’ and was seen as the major criticism that
Martha Nussbaum had of Amartya Sen’s work on the capability
approach. Section 4.4 investigates the relationship between the basic
needs approach and philosophical theories of needs, and argues that
the capability scholars may be able to engage more fruitfully with
theories of needs. Section 4.5 asks whether, as Nussbaum suggests,
we should understand the capability approach as a theory that
addresses the government; I will argue that we should reject that
suggestion and also take other ‘agents of change’ into account. Section
4.6 analyses a debate that has generated much controversy, namely
whether the capability approach can be said to be too individualistic.
The next section, 4.7, focuses on a closely related issue: the scope

170

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

for the inclusion of ‘power’ into the capability approach. Should the
capability approach pay much more attention to political economy?
Section 4.8 asks whether the capability approach is a liberal theory,
and whether it can be anything other than a liberal theory. Section 4.9
argues that, despite the many references to ‘the human development
and capability approaches’, these are not the same thing. Finally,
section 4.10 discusses the potential and problems of a capabilitarian
welfare economics.

4.2 Is everything that’s called a capability
genuinely a capability?
Since this chapter is the place to collect critiques and debates, let me
start with a very basic point of criticism: not everything that is called
‘a capability’ in the capability literature is, upon closer examination,
genuinely a capability. The main criticism that I want to offer in this
brief section is that we should be very careful in our choices of terms
and concepts: not everything that is important is a capability, and it
is conceptually confusing (and hence wrong) to call everything that is
important a capability. As an interdisciplinary language used in many
different disciplines, the capability approach already suffers from
sloppy use of terms because of interdisciplinary differences in their
usage, and we should avoid contributing to this conceptual confusion.
Let me give one example to illustrate the critique.
In her book Allocating the Earth as well as in earlier work, Breena
Holland (2008, 2014) argues that the role of the environment in making
capabilities possible is so important and central that we should
conceptualize environmental ecological functioning (that is, the
ecosystem services that the environment offers to human beings) as
a meta-capability that underlies all other capabilities. As Holland puts
it, “the environment’s ecological functioning is a meta-capability in
the sense that it is a precondition of all the capabilities that Nussbaum
defines as necessary for living a good human life” (2014, 112). By
using this terminology, Holland wants to stress that protecting
the ecosystem is not just one way among many equally good ways
to contribute to human wellbeing — rather, it is a crucial and nonsubstitutable precondition for living. Yet one could question whether
conceptualizing it as a “meta-capability” is correct. As I have argued

4. Critiques and Debates



171

elsewhere (Robeyns 2016a), the environment is not a capability,
since capabilities are real opportunities for beings and doings. The
environment and the services that its ecosystems give to human beings
are absolutely necessary for human life to be possible in the first place,
but that doesn’t warrant giving it the conceptual status of a ‘capability’.
It would have been better, in my view, to introduce a term showing that
there are substitutable and non-substitutable preconditions for each
capability, and that there are absolutely necessary (or crucial) versus
less central preconditions. An environment that is able to deliver a
minimal level of ecosystem services to life on our planet is both a
non-substitutable as well as an absolutely necessary precondition for
human wellbeing understood in terms of capabilities. There are many
other preconditions for human wellbeing, but a minimum level of
sustainable ecosystem services is one of the very few — perhaps even
the only one — that is both non-substitutable and absolutely necessary.
That makes it hugely important — perhaps even more important than
some capabilities (which could be accommodated by including it in
proposition A6), but the absolute priority it should receive does not
warrant us to call it a capability.

4.3 Should we commit to a
specific list of capabilities?
At an earlier stage of the development of the capability approach, a
rather heated debate took place on whether or not it was necessary
for Sen to list the capabilities he felt were relevant for the issue under
consideration. This ‘question of the list’ debate wasn’t always very
helpful, since participants were not making the distinction between
capability theories and the capability approach, which, as I will show
in this section, is crucial to answer this question. Several scholars have
criticized Sen for not having specified which capabilities matter or for
not giving us some guidelines on how the selection of capabilities could
be conducted (e.g. Sugden 1993; Roemer 1996; Nussbaum 2003a). As is
well known, Sen has explicitly refrained from committing himself to
one particular list of capabilities. But should Sen (or anyone else) do so?
In order to answer that question, it is important to keep the distinction
in mind between the general capability approach, and particular
capability theories. As Mozaffar Qizilbash (2012) rightly points out, Sen

172

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

has written on the capability approach in general and he has developed
particular capability applications, critiques, and theories. When asking
whether Sen (or anyone else) should commit to a particular list of
capabilities, we have to keep that distinction firmly in mind — since it
is relevant to our answer.
It is obvious that there cannot be one list that applies to all the different
purposes for which the capability approach can be used — that is, one
list that applies to more specific capability theories and applications.
Hence insofar as it is argued that Sen (or any other capability scholar)
should endorse a particular list of capabilities when discussing the
capability approach, rather than more specific capability theories, this
critique misfires. This is part of the answer that Sen has given to his
critics. Each application or theory based on the capability approach will
always require a selection of valuable functionings that fits the purpose
of the theory or application. Hence the capability approach as such is
deliberately too underspecified to endorse just one single list that could
be used for all capability analyses (Sen 1993, 2004). It is quite likely that
those who have criticised Sen, or the capability approach in general,
for not entailing a specific list of capabilities, have not sufficiently
appreciated the distinction between the capability approach in general
and more specific capability theories.
But what then about specific capability theories, applications and
analyses? Should these always commit to a particular list of capabilities?
It is possible to distinguish between two types of critique addressing
capability theories, which I labelled the weak and strong critiques
(Robeyns 2005a). The strong critique entails that there must be a clear
list of capabilities that we can use for all capability theories and their
application.
The strong critique is most clearly voiced by Nussbaum, who has
proposed a list of ten “central human capabilities” that specify the
political principles that every person should be entitled to as a matter
of justice.1 Nussbaum’s capabilities theory differs in a number of ways
from Sen’s version. Nussbaum (1988, 2003) not only argues that these
ten capabilities are the relevant ones, but in addition claims that if
1	These ten capabilities are: Life; Bodily health; Bodily integrity; Senses, imagination
and thought; Emotions; Practical reason; Affiliation; Other species; Play; and
Control over one’s environment. For more details, see Nussbaum (2006b, 76–78).

Sen wants his version of the capability approach to have any bite for
addressing issues of social justice, he has to endorse one specific and
well-defined list of capabilities.
Sen does not accept the stronger critique as it applies to particular
capability theories. The reason is the importance he attaches to agency,
the process of choice, and the freedom to reason with respect to the
selection of relevant capabilities. He argues that theory on its own is not
capable of making such a final list of capabilities (Sen 2004). Instead, Sen
argues that we must leave it to democratic processes and social choice
procedures to define the distributive policies. In other words, when
the capability approach is used for policy work, it is the people who
will be affected by the policies who should decide on what will count
as valuable capabilities for the policy in question. This immediately
makes clear that in order to be operational for (small-scale) policy
implementation, the capability approach needs to engage with theories
of deliberative democracy and public deliberation and participation.
Sen’s response to the strong critique can be better understood by
highlighting his meta-theoretical views on the construction of theories,
and theories of justice in particular. One should not forget that Sen is
predominantly a prominent scholar in social choice theory, which is
the discipline that studies how individual preferences and interests
can be combined to reach collective decisions, and how these processes
affect the distribution and levels of welfare and freedom. Sen published
ground-breaking work in social choice theory before he started working
on the capability approach, and he has never ceased to be interested in
and to contribute to social choice theory.2 Sen’s passion for social choice
theory is also a very likely explanation for his critique of the dominant
forms of contemporary theories of justice, which, he argues, focus on
describing a utopian situation of perfect justice, rather than giving us
tools to detect injustices and decide how to move forward to a less
unjust society (Sen 2006, 2009c).
According to my reading of Sen’s work on capability theories and
applications, he is not against the selection of dimensions in general, but
rather (a) against one list that would apply to all capability theories and

see Sen (1970a, 1970b, 1976, 1977b, 1979, 1983, 1986, 1992c, 1999c, 2017).

applications, and (b) as far as those capability theories and applications
are concerned, in favour of seriously considering procedural methods
to decide which capabilities matter.
However, even if we all accept that view, it doesn’t settle all disputes.
Even if we agree that a selection of capabilities for, say, a poverty
evaluation should differ from the selection of capabilities for a theory
of justice, this still allows for different views on how that selection
should be made. Some scholars have argued that it should be based on
normative grounds, in other words based on philosophical reasoning
and argumentation (Nussbaum 2000; 2006b; Claassen 2016). Others
have argued for a selection based on a procedural method (Byskov
2017). For empirical applications, it has been argued that the selection
of dimensions should be made in a way that minimises biases in the
selection (Robeyns 2003). For policy-relevant applications, it has been
argued that the freedoms listed in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights could provide a good starting point, and should plausibly be
playing a larger role in the selection of capabilities (Vizard 2007; Burchardt
and Vizard 2011). There are by now various overviews published on
how to select functionings and capabilities but, interestingly, they
almost always are limited to a certain type of capability theory, such
as wellbeing for policy making (Hick and Burchardt 2016; Alkire 2016),
multidimensional poverty measurement (Alkire 2016; Alkire et al.
2015), human development projects and policies (Alkire 2002; Byskov
forthcoming) and theories of justice (Robeyns 2016d). Thus, there are
a range of arguments pointing out that the selection of capabilities for
particular capability theories needs to be sensitive to the purpose of the
theory in question, hence selection is a matter to be decided at the level
of the individual capability theories, rather than at the more general and
abstract level of the capability approach (see also Sen 2004a).

4.4 Why not use the notion of needs?
By introducing the concepts of ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’, the
capability approach offers some specific notions of ‘advantage’ and
provides an ethical framework to guide our actions and institutional
design. It is also a theoretical framework with clear commitments
to practice and policy making in the world as it is, not just in some
hypothetical world or in a stylized model. However, the same can be

4. Critiques and Debates

said of the (basic) needs approach, which was introduced and developed
much earlier in the landscape of ethical approaches related to wellbeing
and poverty. Hence, the obvious question to ask is: why not use the
notion of needs for our theoretical work, and the basic needs approach
for work on development?
To answer that question, it makes sense to make a distinction
between the basic needs approach as it has been used by development
scholars and policy makers, and the philosophical theories of basic
needs. Let us look at the basic needs approach first. This is a practice
and policy oriented approach “that gives priority to meeting people’s
basic needs — to ensuring that there are sufficiently, appropriately
distributed basic need goods and services to sustain all human lives at
a minimally decent level” (Stewart 2006, 14). The basic needs approach
was a reaction to the development policies that many countries in the
Global South pursued after independence from colonial rule, and that
led to a dualistic pattern of development, with a small modern sector
that allowed some people to flourish while at the same time leaving
many other people in poverty and unemployment. The fundamental
claim of the basic needs approach was that the poor not only need a
monetary income but also some very basic goods and services such as
clean water, enough food, health services, and education. Given the
urgency of these needs, the hope was that the requirement to supply
them would be more readily accepted by governments in both the
Global South and North than theoretical arguments about inequality
(Stewart 2006, 15).
In the 1980s, the basic needs approach lost support because
development donors shifted their attention to the goals of stability
and adjustment, but when they again started to pay attention to the
poor, adopting the capability approach, and especially the more policy
oriented human development paradigm, seemed more attractive.
However, according to Frances Stewart (2006, 18), when applied to
the concern of reducing poverty in the Global South, the capability
approach and the basic needs approach are very similar in terms of the
actions they recommend.
Why, then, would anyone consider the capability approach over the
basic needs approach? The first reason is that the capability approach
seems to have a more elegant philosophical foundation (Stewart 2006,
18). However, while its seeming elegance might have been perceived

176

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

by the basic needs practitioners as a reason for its adoption, the
question is whether this is true, given that there have always been the
philosophical theories of needs, to which we turn below. Perhaps the
answer is pragmatic and points to an advantage of the interdisciplinary
nature of the capability approach: Sen did not only lay out its theoretical
foundations, but also, via his empirical work and his contributions to the
Human Development Reports, translated those philosophical ideas into
practice. Perhaps it is the case that a philosophical theory needs some
charismatic thinker who translates it into practice, since otherwise it is
not picked up by policy makers. In the case of the capability approach,
Sen did both the philosophical work and the policy translation.
Another reason mentioned by Stewart is that the capability
approach focuses more on the situation of individuals than the basic
needs approach (Stewart 2006, 18). The capability approach doesn’t
recommend the delivery of the same basic goods to everyone, but rather
that we take human diversity as much as possible into account. The basic
needs approach was more broad-brush than the capability approach,
which stresses the additional resources needed by some people, such
as the disabled. A third reason is that the capability approach applies
to all human beings, hence also to the rich, whereas the basic needs
approach has generally been perceived as focused on poor people
in poor countries (Streeten 1995, ix). The more inclusive scope of the
capability approach, which applies to all human beings, resonates with
an increasing acknowledgement that countries in the Global North
also include people with low levels of wellbeing, and that ideas of
development, social progress and prosperity apply to all countries. This
is very well captured in the case of the Sustainable Development Goals,
which are goals applicable to all countries.
Many of the earlier key advocates of the basic need approach
are pursuing their goals now under the umbrella of the human
development paradigm. Hence the pragmatic and policy oriented basic
needs approach has joined the human development paradigm, which
has become much stronger politically. For policy making, the influence
of frameworks at a particular point in time is one of the relevant
considerations whether one should adopt one framework rather than
another, and hence there is a good reason why, given their pragmatic
goals, the basic needs advocates have contributed to a joint endeavour
with capability scholars to set up the human development paradigm.

4. Critiques and Debates

177

But what about the philosophical theories of basic needs? Are there
reasons why we should favour them rather than the capability approach?
The arguments that were given for the pragmatic basic needs approach
apply also to some extent to the questions of the complementarities
and differences between the theories. There are, theoretically, close
similarities between theories of needs and capabilities, and Soran Reader
(2006) has argued that many of the objections that capability scholars
have to theories of needs are unwarranted and based on implausibly
reductionist readings of theories of needs. According to Reader, theories
of needs and capability theories have much more in common than
capability scholars have been willing to see.
Still, Sen has been notorious in arguing that the capability approach
is superior to the basic needs approach, a critique he has reaffirmed
in his latest book (Sen 2017, 25). In his paper ‘Goods and people’,
Sen (1984a, 513–15) criticised the basic needs approach for being too
focussed on commodities, and seeing human beings as passive and
needy. Those criticisms were rebutted by Alkire (2002, 166–74), who
believed they were based on misinterpretations. However, Alkire did
argue that the other two claims by Sen were correct. First, that the basic
needs approach confines our attention to the most desperate situations,
and is therefore only useful to developing countries. Alkire, however,
sees this as potentially a strength of the basic needs approach; one
could argue that it helps us to focus our attention on the worst off. Sen’s
final criticism was, according to Alkire, the one with most theoretical
bite: that the basic needs approach does not have solid philosophical
foundations.
However, the question is whether that is true. A set of recent
papers by basic needs scholars (Brock and Reader 2002; Reader and
Brock 2004; Reader 2006) make clear that the philosophical theory of
basic needs is sophisticated; moreover, several philosophically highly
sophisticated theories of needs have been proposed in the past, both
in the Aristotelian tradition but also more recently by contemporary
philosophers (e.g. Doyal and Gough 1991; Wiggins 1998). Instead, a
more plausible explanation for the basic needs approach losing ground
in comparison to the capability approach seems to me that in the case of
the basic needs approach, there was less interaction between empirical
scholars and policy makers on the one hand, and philosophers on
the other. It is hard to find evidence of a clear synergy between basic

178

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

needs philosophers and basic needs development scholars and policy
advisors — an interaction that is very present in the capability literature.
This may explain why the basic needs approach has been seen as lacking
solid conceptual foundations.
Yet despite these hypotheses, which may help us understand why
the capability approach to a large extent replaced the focus on needs in
the practical field and in empirical research, some genuine differences
remain. The first difference requires the capability approach to adopt
some basic distinctions that are fundamental to philosophical needs
theory, and for which the capability approach in itself does not have
the resources: the distinction between non-contingent needs on the one
hand, and contingent needs, desires, wants, etc. on the other hand. Noncontingent needs are cases in which “the needing being simply cannot
go on unless its need is met” (Reader and Brock 2004, 252). This relates
to a more common-sense distinction between ‘needs’ and ‘wants’, that
has an important relevance to our everyday ethical life and to policy
making, but that has no equivalent in the capability approach. For
some applications of the capability approach, such as those related to
prioritising in conditions of extreme scarcity of resources (whether these
resources are money, food, water, the right to emit greenhouse gasses,
etc.) theories of needs can provide tools to guide our moral priorities that
are lacking in the capability approach. Right now, preferences dominate
in public decision making, but the concept of preferences cannot make
a distinction between a preference for minimal amounts of water, food,
safety, and social interaction, versus a preference for wine and a jacuzzi.
The preferences-based approach, which has become very dominant in
ethical theory as well as policy analysis by economists, doesn’t have the
theoretical resources to make such a distinction, whereas it is central to
some of our intuitions of how to prioritise our actions in cases of scarcity
(e.g. J. O’Neill 2011; Robeyns 2017a).
The second difference follows from the first. The distinction
in theories of needs between the morally required (meeting noncontingent or basic needs) and the morally laudable but not required
(the other needs, wants, desires, etc.) implies that the needs approach
may have a smaller scope than the capability approach. The modular
view of the capability approach presented in chapter 2 makes clear that
the capability approach can be used for a wide variety of capabilitarian
theories and applications. The basic needs approach is more focussed

4. Critiques and Debates



179

on situations in which we need to prioritise — but the domain of ethical
questions is broader than that.
In conclusion, the basic needs approach in practice is, for pragmatic
and political reasons, now part of the human development paradigm.
At the theoretical level, though, capability scholars neglect to take the
philosophy of needs seriously or to draw on the theoretical resources
of those theories to strengthen particular capabilitarian theories and
applications.

4.5 Does the capability approach
only address the government?
Some capability scholars believe that the capability approach is a theory
about public policy or state action. For example, Nussbaum (2011, 19)
writes that it is an essential element of the (general) capability approach
that it ascribes an urgent task to government and public policy. In her
own capabilities theory of justice, Nussbaum makes very clear that she
sees the government as the actor of change. But is it right to see the
government as the only agent of change or of justice in the capability
approach? I think the literature offers ample evidence that this is not
the case.
The first thing to note is that, while the dominant view is that
the capability approach is related to public policy and assumes the
government as the main or only agent of change, and while Nussbaum
highlights the government as the actor of change in her account of the
capability approach in Creating Capabilities, not all capability scholars
endorse this focus on the government. For example, as Frances Stewart
(2005, 189) writes:
Given that improvements in the position of the poor rarely happen solely
through the benevolence of governments, and are more likely to occur
because of political and economic pressures, organisation of groups
among the poor is important — even essential — to achieve significant
improvements.

The view that the capability approach is government-focussed may thus
be reinforced by the fact that Nussbaum makes this claim, but other
capability scholars are developing theories or applications that address
other agents of change. A prominent example is the work of Solava

180

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Ibrahim (2006, 2009) who has shown how self-help initiatives can play a
crucial role in promoting the capabilities of the poor, by enhancing their
ownership of development projects, and “overcoming their helplessness
by changing their perceptions of their own capabilities” (Ibrahim 2009,
236). Similar research has been conducted in more informal settings
in Khayelitsha, a South African township, by Ina Conradie (2013).
These are just two studies that have been published in widely read
scholarly journals — but there is a broad range of capability theories
and capability applications that do not, or do not primarily, address
the government. In conclusion, the first observation is that some of the
capability literature does not address the government. But can we in
addition also find reasons for not restricting the agents of change in the
capability approach to the government?
The first reason relates to the distinction between the capability
approach and capability theories and applications, which was introduced
in section 2.3. As far as we are looking at the capability approach, rather
than particular capability theories or applications, an exclusive focus on
the government is clearly unwarranted. There is nothing in module A
that forces us to see the government as the addressee of our capability
theory, and module B1 (the purpose of the capability theory) gives us
the choice between any addressee we would like to pick. One could also
use the capability approach to analyse what neighbours, in a particular
street or neighbourhood in a well-functioning democratic state, could
do for each other and in their common interests, in order to improve
the quality of life in their neighbourhood. The neighbours may prefer to
keep the initiative for themselves, and not ask the government to solve
their local problems.
Another example of a capability application in which the government
is not involved at all is the case of parents deciding to which school
to send their child (assuming they have options to choose from, which
globally is not the case for many parents). Suppose that parents have
the choice between two schools. The first school focusses more on
making pupils ready to excel in their future professional life, endorsing
a human capital understanding of education. In the other school, there
is more attention paid to creative expression, learning the virtues of
cooperating, taking responsibility for oneself, for others and for the
environment, and a concern with the flourishing of the child as he or

4. Critiques and Debates



181

she is now, not just as a future adult. Clearly there is a different ideal of
education in these two school. The parents may sit down and write two
lists of the pros and cons of the different schools — and many items on
that list will be functionings or capabilities. Parents choosing between
these two schools will choose different future capability sets for their
children. Although the terminology may not be used, capabilities are at
work in this decision; yet very few people would argue that it is a task
for the government to decide whether children should be sent to schools
focussing on human capital training, or rather on human flourishing.
The scholarship focussing on curriculum design using the capability
approach, or on making us understand the difference between human
capital and human capabilities is doing precisely all of this (Brighouse
2006; Robeyns 2006c; Wigley and Akkoyunlu-Wigley 2006; Walker 2008,
2010, 2012b).
Of course, one could respond to these examples by saying that there
may be capability applications or theories that belong to the private
sphere and that therefore the government is not the (only) agent of
change — yet that capabilitarian political theories, such as theories of
justice, should address the government.
But this response will not do either. As several political theorists
have argued, the question of who should be the agents of justice is
one that needs to be properly discussed and analysed, and it is not
at all obvious that the primary or only agents of justice should be the
government (O. O’Neill 2001; Weinberg 2009; Deveaux 2015). There are
at least three reasons one could give for not giving the government the
main role as agent of change, or indeed any role at all. The first reason
is one’s general ideological commitment as regards political systems.
Anarchism and (right-)libertarian political theories would either give
the government no agency at all, or else only insofar as property rights
need to be protected (Nozick 1974). There is nothing in the structure of
anarchist or libertarian political theories that rules out their adoption
of functionings and capabilities as (part of) the metric of quality of life
that should guide the social and economic institutions that we choose
for our societies. People have very different views on the question of
what can realistically be expected from a government. Just as we need to
take people as they are, we should not work with an unrealistic utopian
account of government. It may be that the capabilitarian ideal society is

182

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

better reached by a coordinated commitment to individual action or by
relying on market mechanisms. Adherents of public choice theory would
stress that giving the government the power to deliver those goods
will have many unintended but foreseeable negative consequences,
which are much more important than the positive contributions the
government could make.3
A second reason why capabilitarian political theories may not
see the government as the only, or primary, agent of justice, relates
to the distinction between ideal theories of justice (which describe
those normative principles that would be met in a just world, and the
institutions that would meet those principles) versus non-ideal theory
(which describes what is needed to reduce injustices in the world in
which we live).4 In several areas of the world, governmental agents
are involved in the creation of (severe) economic and social injustice,
either internationally or against some of its own minorities, or — in
highly repressive states — against the vast majority of the population
(e.g. Hochschild 1999; Roy 2014). The government is then more part of
the problem than part of the solution, and some would argue that it
is very naive to construct capabilitarian political theories that simply
assume that the government will be a force for the good (Menon 2002).
Similarly, some political philosophers have argued that in cases of
injustice in which the government doesn’t take sufficient action, as in
the case of harms done by climate change, duties fall on others who are
in a position to ‘take up the slack’ or make a difference (Karnein 2014;
Caney 2016).
The third reason why capabilitarian political theories may not see
the government as the only, or primary, agent of justice, relates to the
question of how we decide to allocate the responsibility for being the
agent of change.5 As Monique Devaux points out, we can attribute
moral and political agency derived from our responsibility in creating
the injustice (a position advocated by Thomas Pogge (2008) in his work
on global poverty) or because of the greater capacities and powers that

3	For an introduction to the public choice literature, see Mueller (2003).

(2008); Stemplowska (2008); Robeyns (2008a); Valentini (2012).
5	The second and third reasons may sometimes both be at work in an argument to

4. Critiques and Debates



183

agents have, as Onora O’Neill (2001) has advocated. Devaux (2015,
127–28) argues that in the case of justice related to global poverty,
the moral agency of the poor stems from their experience of living in
poverty. This may not only make them more effective as political agents
in some contexts, but it might also lead to the poor endorsing a different
political agenda, often focussing on empowerment, rather than merely
reducing poverty understood in material terms. This is in tune with the
earlier-mentioned research by Ibrahim (2006, 2009) and Conradie (2013)
on self-organisation by the poor.
It has not been my aim in this section to defend a particular way to
answer the question of who should be the agent(s) of justice. Rather,
my goal has been much more limited — namely, to show that it is not
at all self-evident that a capabilitarian political theory, let alone another
type of capabilitarian theory or application, would always posit the
government as the only agent of change, or the primary agent of change.
Pace what Nussbaum (2011) claims on this issue, there is no reason
why this should be the case, and there are many good reasons why we
should regard our answer to this question as one that requires careful
reasoning and consideration — and ultimately a choice that is made in
module B and module C, rather than a fixed given in module A.

4.6 Is the capability approach too individualistic?
At the beginning of this century, an often-heard critique at academic
meetings on the capability approach was that “the capability approach
is too individualistic”. This critique has been especially widespread
among those who endorse communitarian philosophies, or social
scientists who argue that neoclassical economics is too individualistic,
and believe that the same applies to the capability approach (e.g. Gore
1997; Evans 2002; Deneulin and Stewart 2002; Stewart 2005). The main
claim would be that any theory should regard individuals as part of
their social environment, and hence agents should be recognised
as socially embedded and connected to others, and not as atomised
individuals. Very few scholars have directly argued that the capability
approach is too individualistic, but a few have stated it explicitly.
Séverine Deneulin and Frances Stewart (2002, 66) write that “the
[capability] approach is an example of methodological individualism”

184

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

and also add “the individualism of the [capability] approach leads us
[…] to a belief that there are autonomous individuals whose choices
are somehow independent of the society in which they live”. But is this
critique correct? What are we to make of the argument that the capability
approach is “too individualistic”?6

4.6.1 Different forms of individualism
To scrutinise the allegedly individualistic character of the capability
approach, we should distinguish between ethical or normative
individualism on the one hand and methodological and ontological
individualism on the other. As we already saw in section 2.6.8, ethical
individualism, or normative individualism, makes a claim about who or
what should count in our evaluative exercises and decisions. It postulates
that individuals, and only individuals, are the units of ultimate moral
concern. In other words, when evaluating different states of affairs, we
are only interested in the (direct and indirect) effects of those states on
individuals. Methodological and ontological individualism are somewhat
more difficult to describe, as the debate on methodological individualism
has suffered from confusion and much obscurity. Nevertheless, at
its core is the claim that “all social phenomena are to be explained
wholly and exclusively in terms of individuals and their properties”
(Bhargava 1992, 19). It is a doctrine that includes semantic, ontological
and explanatory individualism. The last is probably the most important
of these doctrines, and this can also explain why many people reduce
methodological individualism to explanatory individualism. Ontological
individualism states that only individuals and their properties exist, and
that all social entities and properties can be identified by reducing them
to individuals and their properties. Ontological individualism hence
makes a claim about the nature of human beings, about the way they
6	Amartya Sen has responded to their critique by stating that “I fear I do not
see at all the basis of their diagnosis” (Sen 2002b, 80). As my arguments in this
section will show, I think Sen is right, because Deneulin’s and Stewart’s critique
fails to distinguish properly between different types of individualism, including
methodological individualism (which the capability approach is not) and normative
individualism (which the capability approach meets, and, as I have argued in
section 2.6.8, should meet).

4. Critiques and Debates



185

live their lives and about their relation to society. In this view, society is
built up from individuals only, and hence is nothing more than the sum
of individuals and their properties. Similarly, explanatory individualism
is the doctrine that all social phenomena can in principle be explained
in terms of individuals and their properties.
The crucial issue here is that a commitment to normative
individualism is not incompatible with an ontology that recognises
the connections between people, their social relations, and their social
embedment. Similarly, a social policy focussing on and targeting certain
groups or communities can be perfectly compatible with normative
individualism.
As I argued in section 2.6.8, the capability approach embraces
normative individualism — and this is, for reasons given there, a
desirable property. However, it also follows from the discussion on the
importance of structural constraints (section 2.7.5) that the capability
approach does not rely on ontological individualism.
Clearly, scholars have divergent (implicit) social theories, and
hence some attach more importance to social structures than others do.
Nevertheless, I fail to see how the capability approach can be understood
to be methodologically or ontologically individualistic, especially since
Sen himself has analysed some processes that are profoundly collective,
such as his analysis of households as sites of cooperative conflict (1990a).
In later work too, he acknowledged persons as socially embedded, as
the following quote from his joint work illustrates:
The [capability] approach used in this study is much concerned with the
opportunities that people have to improve the quality of their lives. It
is essentially a ‘people-centered’ approach, which puts human agency
(rather than organizations such as markets or governments) at the
centre of the stage. The crucial role of social opportunities is to expand
the realm of human agency and freedom, both as an end in itself and
as a means of further expansion of freedom. The word ‘social’ in the
expression ‘social opportunity’ […] is a useful reminder not to view
individuals and their opportunities in isolated terms. The options that a
person has depend greatly on relations with others and on what the state
and other institutions do. We shall be particularly concerned with those
opportunities that are strongly influenced by social circumstances and
public policy […]. (Drèze and Sen 2002: 6)

186

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Of course, the critique is not only (and also not primarily) about Sen’s
work, but about the capability approach in general, or about capability
theories. But the work done by other scholars similarly doesn’t meet
the criteria for being plausibly considered to be methodologically or
ontologically individualistic. In general, we can say that the capability
approach acknowledges some non-individual structures, and for the
various more specific capability theories, the degree to which they move
away from methodological or ontological individualism depends on the
choices made in modules B and C. But whatever those choices are, there
are already some features in module A that prevent capability theories
from being methodologically or ontologically individualistic.

4.6.2 Does the capability approach
pay sufficient attention to groups?
The critique that the capability approach should focus more on groups
is often related to the critique that the focus of the capability approach
is too individualistic, but it is nevertheless a distinct critique. A clear
example can be found in the work of Frances Stewart (2005), who argues
that in order to understand processes that affect the lives of people, such
as violent conflict, one has to look at group capabilities — which she
defines as the average of the individual capabilities of all the individuals
in the selected group. The reason we need to focus on these ‘group
capabilities’ is because they are a central source of group conflict. They
are thus crucial to understand processes such as violent conflict.
We will return to Stewart’s specific complaint below, but first
unpack the general critique that the capability approach doesn’t pay
enough attention to groups. To properly judge the critique that the
capability approach does not pay sufficient attention to groups, we need
to distinguish between a weaker and a stronger version of that claim.
A stronger version of that claim would be that the capability approach
cannot pay sufficient attention to groups — that there is something
in the conceptual apparatus of the capability approach that makes it
impossible for the capability approach to pay attention to groups. But
that claim is obviously false, because there exists a large literature of
research analysing the average capabilities of one group compared to

4. Critiques and Debates

another, e.g. women and men (Kynch and Sen 1983; Nussbaum 2000;
Robeyns 2003, 2006a) or the disabled versus those without disabilities
(Kuklys 2005; Zaidi and Burchardt 2005). Capability theorists have
also written on the importance of groups for people’s wellbeing, like
Nussbaum’s discussion of women’s collectives in India. Several lists of
capabilities that have been proposed in the literature include capabilities
related to community membership: Nussbaum stresses affiliation as
an architectonic capability, Alkire (2002) discusses relationships and
participation, and in earlier work I have included social relationships
(Robeyns 2003). The UNDP (1995, 2004) has produced Human
Development Reports on both gender and culture, thus policy reports
based on the capability approach focus on groups.
The weaker claim states that the present state of the literature on the
capability approach does not pay sufficient attention to groups. I agree
that contemporary mainstream economics is very badly equipped to
account for group membership on people’s wellbeing. But is this also
the case for the capability approach? While some capability theorists
have a great faith in people’s abilities to be rational and to resist social
and moral pressure stemming from groups (e.g. Sen 1999b, 2009b),
other writers on the capability approach pay much more attention to
the influence of social norms and other group-based processes on our
choices and, ultimately, on our wellbeing (e.g. Alkire 2002; Nussbaum
2000; Iversen 2003; Robeyns 2003a). There is thus no reason why the
capability approach would not be able to take the normative and
constitutive importance of groups fully into account. Admittedly,
however, this is a theoretical choice that needs to be made when making
scholarly decisions in modules B3, B5 and C1, hence we may not agree
with the assumptions about groups in each and every capability theory.
If we return to the reasons Stewart gave for a focus on group
capabilities, we notice that the main reason stated is that analysis
of group capabilities is needed to understand outcomes. Yet that is
precisely what the just mentioned capability applications do (since
they do not only measure group inequalities in capabilities but also try
to understand them). Those applications also investigate how group
identities constrain groups to different degrees, or which privileges
they ensure for certain groups. In my reading of the literature, many

188

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

capability scholars do precisely this kind of work, and to the extent
that they do not do so, one important reason is that they are engaging
in documenting and measuring inequalities, rather than in explaining
them. The complaint should then be that capability analysis should
be less concerned with documenting and measuring inequalities, and
should spend more time on understanding how inequalities emerge,
are sustained, and can be decreased — but that is another complaint.
Still, I do think that a consideration of the role of groups in the capability
approach gives us a warning. To fully understand the importance of
groups, capability theories should engage more intensively in a dialogue
with disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, history, and gender
and cultural studies. This will make the choices of the account of human
diversity (module B3), the account of structural constraints (module B5),
and of ontological and explanatory theories (module C1) more accurate.
Disciplinary boundaries and structures make these kinds of dialogues
difficult, but there is no inherent reason why this could not be done.

4.6.3 Social structures, norms and institutions
in the capability approach
The critique that the capability approach is too individualistic is
sometimes also put in another way, namely that the capability approach
should pay more attention to collective features, such as social structures,
social norms, and institutions. How can the capability approach account
for such collective aspects of human living?
At the theoretical level, the capability approach does account
for social relations and the constraints and opportunities of societal
structures and institutions on individuals in two ways. First, by
recognising the social and environmental factors which influence the
conversions of commodities into functionings. For example, suppose
that Jaap and Joseph both have the same individual conversion factors
and possess the same commodities. But Jaap is living in a town with
cycle lanes and low criminality rates, whereas Joseph is living in a city
with poor infrastructure for cyclists, and with high levels of criminality
and theft. Whereas Jaap can use his bike to cycle anywhere he wants, at
any moment of the day, Joseph will be faced with a much higher chance
that his bike will be stolen. Hence, the same commodity (a bike) leads

4. Critiques and Debates



189

to different levels of the functioning ‘to transport oneself safely’, due to
characteristics of the society in which one lives (its public infrastructure,
crime levels etc).
The second way in which the capability approach accounts for
societal structures and constraints is by theoretically distinguishing
functionings from capabilities. More precisely, moving from capabilities
to achieved functionings requires an act of choice. Now, it is perfectly
possible to take into account the influence of societal structures and
constraints on those choices, by choosing a nuanced and rich account
of agency (module B4 — account of agency) and of societal structures
(module B5 — account of structural constraints). For example, suppose
Sarah and Sigal both have the same intellectual capacities and human
capital at the age of six, and live in a country where education is free
and children from poorer families receive scholarships. Sarah was born
in a class in which little attention was paid to intellectual achievement
and studying, whereas Sigal’s parents are both graduates pursuing
intellectual careers. The social environment in which Sarah and Sigal
live will greatly influence and shape their preferences for studying. In
other words, while initially Sarah and Sigal have the same capability
set, the social structures and constraints that influence and shape
their preferences will influence the choice they will make to pick one
bundle of functionings. The capability approach allows us to take those
structures and constraints on choices into account, but whether a
particular capability theory will take that into account depends on the
choices made in the various modules, especially modules B4 and B5. Yet
it is clear that the choices made in modules B and C will have ultimately
far reaching consequences for our capabilitarian evaluations.
Summing up, one could, plausibly, complain that a certain capability
theory doesn’t pay sufficient attention to social structures or collective
features of human life. This may well be a very valid critique of a
particular capability theory in which the additional theories of human
diversity, social structures, and other social theories more generally, are
very minimal (that is, the explanatory and ontological theories added
in C1 do not properly account for many collective features of life). But I
have argued that it is not a valid critique against the capability approach
in general.

190

4.7 What about power and political economy?
In section 4.6, I analysed the critique that the capability approach
is too individualistic, and argued that this charge is based on a
misunderstanding of different distinct types of individualism, as well
as a flawed (and unduly limited) understanding of the potential for
capability theories to include social structures as factors that explain
varying levels of advantage between different people. However, there
are two closely related critiques that must be addressed briefly: first, that
the capability approach downplays power and social structures, and
second, that capability theories divert our attention from the political
economy of poverty and inequality, which is much more important
than the measurement and evaluation of poverty and inequality. Let us
analyse these two critiques in turn.

4.7.1 Which account of power and choice?
The first worry is that the capability approach is insufficiently critical of
social constraints on people’s actions, and does not pay due attention to
“global forces of power and local systems of oppression” (Koggel 2003).
Put differently, the worry is that the capability approach does not pay
sufficient attention to inequalities in power (Hill 2003). Similarly, there is
also a worry that the capability approach could be used in combination
with a stripped-down version of human choice. For example, despite
Sen’s repeated criticism of choice as revealed preference, one could in
principle make interpersonal comparisons of functionings that assume
revealed preference theory: a person will choose from their option
set what is best for them. But this ignores the fact that our choices are
heavily influenced by patterns of expectations and social norms,7 as
well as commitments we have to certain interests that do not necessarily
affect our own advantage.8 Depending on the choice theory one adopts,
the capability approach could lead to widely divergent normative
conclusions (Robeyns 2000; 2001). Standard economics pays very little
attention to the social and cultural constraints that impinge on people’s

choices, in contrast to sociology, gender studies and cultural studies,
among other disciplines. In political philosophy, one sees a similar split
between the core of Anglo-American political philosophy, in which the
concept of the self that is endorsed is that of a rational, autonomous
agent whose own plans take precedence over things he finds as ‘given’
in his life, versus other traditions in philosophy that pay more attention
to relations and the social embedding of individuals, including unjust
structures in which one finds oneself, as well as mechanisms that
reproduce power differences. The consequence is that it is possible to
use functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space in combination
with many different normative accounts of choice, with a widely
divergent critical content.
Take as an example the choices made by men versus women between
paid (labour market) or unpaid (care and household) work. In all societies
women do much more household and care work, whereas men do much
more paid work. Both kinds of work can generate a number of different
functionings so that the largest capability set might perhaps be reached
only by giving everyone the opportunity to combine both types of work.
However, I would argue that in the world today, in which hardly any
society allows people to combine market work and non-market work
without having to make significant compromises when it comes to the
quality of at least one of them, the labour market enables more (and more
important) functionings than care work. These include psychological
functionings like increased self-esteem; social functionings like having a
social network; material functionings like being financially independent
and securing one’s financial needs for one’s old age or in the event of
divorce.9 Many schools in political philosophy and normative welfare
economics have typically seen the gender division of labour as ethically
unproblematic, in the sense that this division is seen as the result of
men’s and women’s voluntary choices, which reflect their preferences.
However, this is an inadequate way of explaining and evaluating this
division, because gender-related structures and constraints convert
this choice from an individual choice under perfect information into a
collective decision under socially constructed constraints with imperfect
information and asymmetrical risks. Moreover, evaluating the gender
9	As is also suggested by the empirical findings of Enrica Chiappero-Martinetti
(2000) who measured achieved functioning levels for Italy.

192

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

division of labour can only be done if we scrutinise the constraints on
choice, and these may turn out to be very different for men and women.10
What is crucial for the discussion here is that both positive theories
of the gender division of labour (which are choices made in modules
B3, B4, and B5) bear different normative implications. If a housewife
is held fully responsible for the fact that she works at home then the
logical consequence would be that she had the capability to work in the
labour market. However, if we embrace a theory of choice that focuses
on gender specific constraints, then we will not hold the housewife
fully responsible for her choice but acknowledge that her capability set
was smaller and did not contain the possibility for a genuine choice to
work in the labour market. It seems, thus, that it is perfectly possible to
apply the capability approach in combination with different accounts of
gender-specific constraints on choices.
By giving choice such a central position and making its place in
wellbeing and social justice evaluations more explicit, the capability
approach opens up a space for discussions of how certain choices are
constrained by gender-related societal mechanisms and expectations.
But again, the capability approach provides no guarantee for this:
it depends on the choices made in modules B and C. For example,
conservatives will want to integrate a conservative theory of gender
relations within the capability approach, whereas for critical scholars it
will be crucial to integrate a feminist account of gender relations, which
includes an account of power. No doubt the two exercises will reach
very different normative conclusions. In short, for scholars who defend
a theory of human agency and social reality that challenges the status
quo, one of the important tasks will be to negotiate which additional
theories will be integrated in further specifications of the capability
approach, especially the choices made in module C1.
The conclusion is that the core characteristics of the capability
approach (as listed in module A) do not necessarily have significant
implications for the role of power in capability theories and applications,
which can include widely divergent views on social realities and
interpersonal relations. Indeed, the fact that the capability approach
10	The seminal work in this area is Susan Okin’s book Justice, Gender and the Family
(Okin 1989). On the gendered nature of the constraints on choice, see also Nancy
Folbre (1994).

4. Critiques and Debates



193

interests both scholars who work in the libertarian tradition, as well as
scholars who work in more critical traditions, illustrate this conclusion.
My own personal conviction is that there is ample reason why we
should not adopt a stripped-down view of the roles of social categories
and social structures, and hence include a rich account of power that
is supported by research in anthropology, sociology and other social
sciences. But for everyone advancing a capability theory or application,
it holds that they should defend their implicit social theories, and be
willing to scrutinize them critically.

4.7.2 Should we prioritise analysing
the political economy?
Capability scholars have been criticised for having the wrong priorities:
by focusing so much on the metric of justice and on human diversity
in the conversion of resources into capabilities, their approach
draws attention away from huge inequalities in terms of resources
(income, wealth) and therefore helps to preserve the (unjust) status
quo. Thomas Pogge (2002) has specifically argued that the capability
approach — Sen’s work in particular — overemphasises the role of
national and local governments, thereby neglecting the huge injustices
created by the global economic system and its institutional structures,
such as global trade rules. Similarly, Alison Jaggar (2002, 2006) has
argued that western philosophers, and Martha Nussbaum’s work on
the capability approach in particular, should not prioritise the analysis
of cultural factors constraining poor women’s lives, or listing what an
ideal account of flourishing and justice would look like, but rather focus
on the global economic order and other processes by which the rich
countries are responsible for global poverty.
Pogge and Jaggar may have a point in their charge that capability
theorists have paid insufficient attention to these issues, which have
been discussed at length in the philosophical literature on global justice.
But one might also argue that this is orthogonal to the issues about which
the capability approach to social justice is most concerned, namely, how
to make interpersonal comparisons of advantage for the purposes of
social justice. One could, quite plausibly, hold the view that, since most
capability theorists are concerned with human wellbeing, they should

194

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

invest their energies in addressing the most urgent cases of injustice,
investigate their underlying causal processes and mechanisms, and
concentrate on the development of solutions. Using the modular view
of the capability approach, this critique boils down to the view that
we should concentrate on modules outside the core, namely those that
explain certain unjust structures.
This is not, however, a valid critique of the capability approach as a
general framework, nor does it recognise the role that capability theories
can play in substantive debates about global justice and inequality.
Rather, the critique should be reformulated to say that the most urgent
issues of justice do not require theories of justice, but rather a political
and economic analysis of unjust structures. But then we are no longer
facing a critique of the capability approach, but rather a critique of our
research priorities, which goes beyond the scope of this book.11 It is clear
that the capability approach will not solve all the world’s problems,
and that we should regard it as a tool to help us in analysing cases that
need our attention, rather than an intellectual project that has become
an end in itself for academics. However, it doesn’t follow therefore that
all scholars developing the capability approach should become political
economists — or malaria researchers, for that matter.

4.8 Is the capability approach a liberal theory?
Students of the capability approach often ask whether it is a liberal
theory — something those who ask that question seem to think is a bad
thing. Given the various audiences and disciplines that engage with
the capability approach, there is a very high risk of misunderstandings
of discipline-specific terms, such as ‘liberal’. Hence, let us answer the
question: is the capability approach a liberal theory, and if so, in what
sense?
In many capability theories and applications, including the work by
Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, there is a great stress on capabilities
rather than functionings, as well as on agency and the power of people to

11	Serene Khader (2011, 24–30) faces similar critiques in her study of adaptive
preferences (rather than the global economic order), and provides a sensible
response to those worries.

195

shape their own destinies.12 What is ultimately important is that people
have the freedoms (capabilities) to lead the kind of lives they want to
lead, to do what they want to do and be the person they want to be.
Once they have these freedoms, they can choose to act on them in line
with their own ideas of the kind of life they want to live. For example,
every person should have the opportunity to be part of a community
and to practice a religion, but if someone prefers to be a hermit or an
atheist, they should also have this option. Now, it is certainly true that
individual freedoms and agency are a hallmark of liberalism. But is this
enough to conclude that the capability approach, in contrast to specific
capability theories, is a liberal framework?13
First, given the interdisciplinary context in which the capability
approach is operating, it is very important that the word ‘liberal’ is
not confused with the word ‘liberal’ in daily life. In ordinary language,
‘liberal’ has different political meanings in different countries, and
can cover both the political right or left. In addition it is often used to
refer to (neo)liberal economic policies that prioritise free markets and
the privatization of public companies such as water suppliers or the
railways. In contrast, philosophical liberalism is neither necessarily left
or right, nor does it a priori advocate any social or economic policies.
The first misunderstanding to get out the way is that capabilities as
freedoms refer exclusively to the ‘free market’ and thus that the capability
approach would always lead to an endorsement of (unfettered) markets
as the institutions that are capabilities-enhancing. Sen does argue that
people have reason to value the freedom or liberty to produce, buy, and
sell in markets. This point, however, is part of his more general work on
development, and it is very different to the highly disputed question in
economics and politics regarding the benefits and limits of the market
as a system of economic production and distribution. Functionings
and capabilities are conceptualizations of wellbeing achievements and
wellbeing freedoms, and the question of which economic institutions
are the best institutional means to foster functionings and capabilities

whether or not to adopt certain group memberships and identities. See e.g. Sen
(2009b).
13	In earlier work, I argued that on those grounds we could conclude that the capability
approach is a liberal theory. I now think this conclusion was premature.

196

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

is both analytically and politically a question that can only be settled
after we first agree what economic outcomes we should be aiming for: a
question to which the capability approach gives a (partial) answer.
The question of what are the appropriate institutions to lead to
capability expansions is a separate one, which cannot be answered by
the capability approach in itself; it must be coupled with a political
economy analysis. However, there is nothing in the (limited) literature
that has undertaken this task so far to suggest that a capability analysis
would recommend unfettered markets — quite the contrary, as the
work by Rutger Claassen (2009, 2015) shows: capabilities theories give
reasons for regulating markets, and for constraining property rights.
In sum, if the word ‘liberal’ is used to refer to ‘neoliberalism’ or to
‘economic liberalization policies’, then neither the capability approach
in general, nor Sen and Nussbaum’s more specific theories, are liberal
in that sense.
Yet I believe it is correct to say that Sen and Nussbaum’s writings
on the capability approach are liberal in the philosophical sense, which
refers to a philosophical tradition that values individual autonomy
and freedom.14 However, even philosophical liberalism is a very broad
church, and Sen and Nussbaum’s theories arguably participate in a
critical strand within it, since the explanatory theories that they use in
their capability theories (that is, the choices they make in module C1),
are in various ways aware of social structures.
Third, while the particular capability theories advocated by Sen
and Nussbaum aspire to be liberal, it is possible to construct capability
theories that are much less so. Take a capability theory that opts in
module C1 for (1) a highly structuralist account of social conditions,
and (2) theories of bounded rationality, that place great emphasis on
people’s structural irrationalities in decision-making. In module C4, the
theory accepts some degree of paternalism due to the acknowledgement
of bounded rationality in decision-making. Similarly, one could have a
capability theory of social justice that argues that the guiding principle
in institutional design should be the protection of the vulnerable, rather

14

 ussbaum (2011b, 2014) has written explicitly on the type of liberalism that her
N
capabilities approach endorses: political liberalism. For arguments that Nussbaum’s
capability approach is, upon closer scrutiny, not politically liberal but rather
perfectionist liberal, see Barclay (2003), and Nussbaum (2003b) for a response.

4. Critiques and Debates



197

than the maximal accommodation of the development of people’s
agency. Such theories would already be much less liberal.
Is it possible for capability theories to be non-liberal? This would
probably depend on where exactly one draws the line between a liberal
and a non-liberal theory, or, formulated differently, which properties
we take to be necessary properties of a theory in order for that theory
to qualify as ‘liberal’. The capability approach draws a clear line at
the principle of each person as an end, that is, in the endorsement of
normative individualism. The principle of normative individualism is
clearly a core principle of liberal theories. Yet it is also a core principle
of some non-liberal theories that do not give higher priority to agency
or autonomy (e.g. capability theories that merge insights from care
ethics, and which give moral priority to protecting the vulnerable
over enhancing and protecting agency). However, if a theory endorses
functionings and/or capabilities as the relevant normative metric, yet
violates the principle of each person as an end, it would not only not
qualify as a liberal theory, but it would also not qualify as a capability
theory. At best, it would qualify as e.g. a hybrid capabilitariancommunitarian theory.

4.9 Why ‘human development’ is
not the same idea
Some believe that the terms ‘human development approach’ and ‘the
capability approach’ are synonymous, or else scholars talk about the
‘capability and human development approach’. Although I will argue
that this usage is misleading, the equation of ‘human development’
with ‘capability approach’ is often made. Why is this the case? And is
that equation a good thing?
First, the Human Development Reports and their best-known
index, the Human Development Index, have been vastly influential in
making the case for the capability approach, and in spreading the idea
of ‘functionings’ and ‘capabilities’ both inside and outside academia
(UNDP 1990). In other words, one of the main series of publications
within the human development approach, and the corresponding
analyses and indexes, is arguably one of the most politically successful
applications of the capability approach. However, it doesn’t follow from
this that they are the same thing.

198

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

A second possible explanation for this misleading equation is that
both the international association and the current name of the main
journal in the field have merged both terms: the Human Development
and Capability Association (HDCA) and the Journal of Human Development
and Capabilities. This seems to suggest that ‘human development’ and
‘capabilities’ necessarily go together. But this need not be the case: the
use of a particular title doesn’t make the two things the same (and in a
moment, I will give a few examples in which this isn’t the case).
Thirdly and most importantly, the equation of ‘human development
approach’ and ‘capability approach’ shouldn’t be surprising because
human development aims to shift the focus of our evaluation of the
quality of life and the desirability of social arrangements, from material
resources or mental states to people’s functionings and capabilities. The
capability approach is thus a central and indispensable element of the
human development paradigm.
Finally, one may believe that the two terms are equivalent given that
some influential authors in the capability literature equate the two terms,
or merge them into one idea (Alkire and Deneulin 2009a, 2009b; FukudaParr 2009; Nussbaum 2011). Let me highlight two examples. Sabina Alkire
and Séverine Deneulin (2009a, 2009b) do not distinguish between the
reach of the capability approach and the human development approach;
instead, they merge them into one term, “the human development and
capability approach”. More recently, Martha Nussbaum (2011) has
written on the distinction in her Creating Capabilities. Nussbaum has
suggested that ‘human development approach’ is mainly associated,
historically, with the Human Development Reports, and that the term
‘capability approach’ is more commonly used in academia. Nussbaum
prefers the term ‘capabilities approach’ since she also likes to include
non-human animals in her account. However, for those of us, like
me, who are using the capability approach to analyse and evaluate
the quality of life as well as the living arrangements of human beings,
this is not a valid reason to make the distinction between ‘the human
development approach’, and ‘the capability approach’.
So, should we use ‘human development approach’ and ‘capability
approach’ as synonyms, and merge them together into ‘the human
development and capability approach’? I believe we shouldn’t. I think

4. Critiques and Debates



199

there are at least four valid reasons why we should make a distinction
between the two ideas.
The first reason is historical: while the capability approach has
been very important in the development of the human development
paradigm, the human development paradigm has derived insights
and concepts from several other theories and frameworks. Human
development has been defined as “an expansion of human capabilities,
a widening of choices, an enhancement of freedoms and a fulfilment
of human rights” (Fukuda-Parr and Kumar 2003, xxi). There are
important historical ideas in the human development paradigm that
are to a significant extent based on Sen’s capability approach. And Sen
was closely involved in the development of the Human Development
Reports that have been key in the maturing of the human development
paradigm. Yet as some key contributors to this paradigm have rightly
pointed out, it had other intellectual roots too, such as the basic needs
approach (Streeten 1995; Fukuda-Parr 2003; Sen 2003a).
The second reason is intellectual. The capability approach is used for
a very wide range of purposes, as the account I presented in chapter 2
makes amply clear. These include purposes that are only tangentially, or
very indirectly, related to human development concerns. For example,
the philosopher Martin van Hees (2013) is interested in the structural
properties of capabilities, especially how the formal analysis of rights
fits into the capability concept. This research allows us to see how
capabilities, as a concept, would fit in, and relate to, the existing literature
on the structure of rights. But it would be a big stretch to say that this is
also a contribution to the human development literature; in fact, I would
find such a statement an implausible inflation of what we understand
by ‘human development’. Rather, it is much more plausible to say that
the study by Van Hees is a contribution to the capability literature, but
not to the human development literature. If we were wrongly to equate
the capability approach with the human development paradigm, this
would create problems for understanding such a study as part of the
capability approach.
The third reason is practical. Those who have written about the
human development paradigm stress that ‘development’ is about all
people and all countries, and not only about countries which are often

200

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

called ‘developing countries’, that is, countries with a much higher
incidence of absolute poverty, and often with a less developed economic
infrastructure. For example, Paul Streeten (1995, viii) writes:
We defined human development as widening the range of people’s
choices. Human development is a concern not only for poor countries and
poor people, but everywhere. In the high-income countries, indicators of
shortfalls in human development should be looked for in homelessness,
drug addiction, crime, unemployment, urban squalor; environmental
degradation, personal insecurity and social disintegration.

The inclusion of all human beings within the scope of ‘human
development thinking’ is widely endorsed within human development
scholarship and policy reports. However, it is also a matter of fact that
most people, including policy makers, associate the term ‘development’
not with improvements to the lives of people living in high-income
countries. This is unfortunate, but it is a fact one needs to reckon with. In
high-income countries, some of the terms often used for what could also
be called ‘human development interventions’ are ‘policies’, ‘institutional
design’, or ‘social transformations’. While it is laudable to deconstruct
the term ‘development’, at the same time we should be careful about
using words that would lead to scholars and policy makers in highincome countries to neglect the capability approach if they (mistakenly)
believe that it is a framework only suitable for ‘developing countries’ (as
they would use the term).
The final reason is political. There are many capability scholars
who would like to develop an alternative to neoliberalism, or, more
specifically when it concerns development policies, to the ‘Washington
consensus’. While more sophisticated analyses of both doctrines have
been put forward, both doctrines focus on private property rights; the
primacy of markets as an allocation mechanism; the focus in macroeconomic policies on controlling inflation and reducing fiscal deficits;
economic liberalisation with regard to free trade and capital flows;
and, overall, restricted and reduced involvement of governments in
the domestic economy, such as markets in labour, land and capital (the
so-called ‘factor markets’) (Gore 2000; Fukuda-Parr 2003; McCleery and
De Paolis 2008). The ‘Washington consensus’ refers to the development

policy views propagated by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (two international institutions based in Washington,
D.C., hence its name). The ideas of the Washington consensus spread in
the 1980s and were endorsed as the consensus view by the IMF and the
World Bank by 1990, and they dominated for at least two decades. Over
the last decade, neoliberalism and the Washington consensus have been
heavily criticised from many different corners, and there is a renewed
recognition of the importance of considering the historical, cultural
and institutional specificity of countries when deciding what good
development policies look like; but it seems too early to conclude that
any of those alternative views is now more influential then neoliberalism
and the Washington consensus. Many citizens, scholars, policy makers
and politicians are searching for alternatives, and some hope that the
capability approach can offer such an alternative.
My suggestion would be that if one’s goal is to develop a powerful
alternative to neoliberalism and the Washington consensus, one has to
look at the human development paradigm, rather than the capability
approach. The human development paradigm includes many specific
explanatory theories that stress the importance of historical paths and
local cultural and social norms in understanding development outcomes
and options in a particular country. The human development paradigm
is, therefore, much more powerful than the capability approach for this
specific purpose.
Recall the modular view of the capability approach that I presented
in chapter 2. The human development paradigm is a capabilitarian
theory or capability application, because it endorses all the elements
from module A. In addition, it has made particular choices in modules
B, such as a strong notion of agency (B3) as well as an elaborate account
of social structures (B4), and, importantly, it has chosen anti-neoliberal
ontological accounts of human nature and explanatory theories about
how the economy and societies work (C1), as well as the endorsement
of additional normative principle and social ideals (C4) such as human
rights and ecological sustainability. Hence the human development
paradigm is much more powerful as a policy paradigm than the
capability approach, since it is much more comprehensive (taking
many more aspects into account then merely people’s functionings and

202

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

capabilities) and it is much more powerful in policy or political terms
(being informed about what works and what doesn’t).
In sum, I think it is not correct to equate the capability approach
and the human development approach. The two are theoretically and
historically related, but they are not exactly the same. For those who work
within development studies and are endorsing a critical assessment of
the development policies that have been pursued as part of the so-called
‘Washington consensus’, it is understandable that the two may seem to
be the same, or at least so close that they can be merged. But that is only
if one looks at the two notions from a specific perspective. Merging the
two would do injustice to the work of other thinkers using the capability
approach, and it would also ultimately hamper the development of the
capability approach over its full scope.

4.10 Can the capability approach
change welfare economics?
Of all the (sub)disciplines where the capability approach is relevant,
welfare economics may well be the one where it is most difficult
to describe its impact. The reason is that the capability approach
could be seen in two very different lights, depending on one’s own
position towards the current state of economics: either as an improved
modification of mainstream welfare economics, or else as a path that
could lead us to a very different type of welfare economics, which would
radically break with some mainstream assumptions and practices.
One could say that the welfare economists interested in the capability
approach have two very different agendas: the first group only wants
some changes in the normative focus, and possibly in some of the
ontological and behavioural assumptions in the theory development,
but no methodological or meta-theoretical changes, whereas the second
group wants a paradigm change or a scientific revolution, in which there
would be meta-theoretical and methodological pluralism (module B7)
and much richer or thicker accounts of human agency (module B3) and
structural constraints (module B5). In addition, it makes a difference
whether we analyse the possibilities for a capabilitarian theoretical
welfare economics or for a capabilitarian empirical welfare economics.

4.10.1 Welfare economics and the economics discipline
Before analysing the reach and limit of the capability approach in
these various endeavours, a few general comments are in order
about economics in general, and welfare economics in particular.
Let us first ask: what is welfare economics? As Sen (1996, 50) writes,
“Welfare economics deals with the basis of normative judgements,
the foundations of evaluative measurement, and the conceptual
underpinnings of policy-making in economics”. While, in practice,
much of the economics discipline is concerned with policy advice,
welfare economics is nevertheless a small subfield of economics, and
is by some prominent welfare economists seen as unduly neglected
or marginalised by mainstream economics (Atkinson 2001). One
important reason is that welfare economics makes explicit the inevitable
normative dimensions of economic policy analysis and evaluations,
and most economists have been socialised to believe that ‘modern
economics’ is value-free, and that anything to do with normativity can
be outsourced to ethics or to a democratic vote. In reality, however, the
imaginary science-value split that mainstream economists would wish
for is, for many economic questions, impossible (Reiss 2013; Hausman,
McPherson and Satz 2016). It would therefore be much better to face
this inevitability upfront, and understand economics as a moral science
(Boulding 1969; Atkinson 2009; Shiller and Shiller 2011) rather than as
applied mathematics or a form of value-free modelling. But in economics,
as in any other discipline, there are complicated sociological processes
conveying views about authority and status, as well as unexamined
beliefs about what ‘good science’ is and which type of objectivity is most
desirable: one is not born an economist, but becomes one through one’s
training, which is in part also a socialisation process (Colander and
Klamer 1987; McCloskey 1998; Nelson 2002). Unfortunately, there is
empirical evidence that many economists are unwilling to engage with
these fundamental questions and hold on to the belief that economics
is superior to other social sciences and has little to learn from other
disciplines (Fourcade, Ollion and Algan 2015). Many economists who
are interested in economic questions but are not endorsing the myth
of value-free social science, or who crave more methodological and
meta-theoretical freedom, have left for another discipline that offers

204

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

them those liberties.15 After all, economists do not have a monopoly on
economic topics, and there are many questions about such topics that
are analysed by economic sociologists, economic historians, political
economists, economic geographers, and economic philosophers. In my
view, one cannot analyse the reach and limits of the capability approach
in welfare economics if one does not acknowledge the high levels of
discontent and methodological conservatism within economics, which
cannot be found in any other discipline that engages with the capability
approach.
With this background in mind, we can now proceed to ask whether
the capability approach can make a difference to welfare economics.
First, in section 4.10.2, we will look at the main theoretical contribution
of the capability approach to welfare economics: its contribution to the
development of non-welfarist welfare economics. In section 4.10.3 we
will analyse what kind of empirical analyses a capabilitarian welfare
economics could make, and what its challenges and possibilities are.
Finally, in section 4.10.4, we analyse what challenges the development
of a heterodox capabilitarian welfare economics would face.

4.10.2 Non-welfarism
The main theoretical contribution of the capability approach is that
it contributes to the development of post-welfarism or non-welfarism in
welfare economics. Welfarism is the position that social welfare depends
exclusively on individual utilities, which are either understood in a
hedonic or in a desire-satisfaction sense, and this has been the dominant
position in economics for a long time. Post-welfarism broadens the
informational basis of interpersonal comparison with non-utility
information, such as deontic rights, or objective information such as
people’s functionings and capabilities. In a series of publications, Sen
has offered strong theoretical arguments to move from welfarism to
non-welfarism (sometimes also called ‘post-welfarism’) and has inspired
other welfare economists to work on a post-welfarist welfare economics

15	There are plenty of academic economists who have moved to history, development
studies or philosophy in order to enjoy the greater methodological and paradigmatic
freedoms in those disciplines.

(e.g. Gaertner and Xu 2006, 2008; Gotoh and Yoshihara 2003; Gotoh,
Suzumura and Yoshihara 2005; Pattanaik 2006; Pattanaik and Xu 1990;
Suzumura 2016; Xu 2002). Some reasons for this move are the same as the
arguments against desire-satisfaction theories or the happiness approach
that we reviewed earlier in sections 3.7 and 3.8. Another argument is
that relevant information is left out of the informational basis. If two social
states have exactly the same utility levels, but social state A has also
a set of legal and social norms that discriminate against one group of
people, whereas in social state B, the principles of moral equality and
non-discrimination are protected, then surely, we should prefer social
state B over social state A. But welfarism, because of its exclusive focus
on utilities, is unable to take any type of non-utility information into
account, whether it is the violation of deontic principles, information on
rights, liberties and justice, or information on inefficient or unsustainable
use of common resources. Many of the welfare economists who have
embarked on the development of a post-welfarist welfare economics
have focussed on the importance of freedom as an important part of the
widening of the informational basis.
Non-welfarist welfare economics requires some changes to our
approach to welfare economics. As Sen (1996, 58) noted in his discussion
of the contribution of the capability approach to non-welfarist welfare
economics, if we move to an informational basis with multiple
dimensions of different types (as in the capability approach) then this
requires explicit evaluations of the different weights to be given to the
contributions of the different functionings and capabilities to overall
(aggregate) social welfare. For Sen, the way to proceed is by public
reasoning about those weights. This should probably not be seen as the
only and exclusive way to determine them, since not all work in welfare
economics is suited for public discussion — for example, it often entails
desk-studies of inequalities or the analysis of the welfare effects of certain
policy measures, and it is practically impossible to organise an exercise
of public reasoning for every desk study that welfare economists make.
Luckily, as the survey by Decancq and Lugo (2013) shows, there are
various weighting systems possible that can give us the weights that are
needed if one wants to aggregate the changes in different functionings
and capabilities. For example, Erik Schokkaert (2007) has suggested that
we derive the weights of the functionings from the contribution they

206

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

make to the life-satisfaction of people, after those weights are cleaned of
ethically suspicious information.
However, as we saw in section 4.10.1, many (possibly most)
economists are unwilling to engage in explicit evaluations, since they
believe in the science/value split and believe that economics can be
value-free. This makes it harder for welfare economics to engage in such
normative work, since they run the risk that their peers will no longer
accept their approach as ‘economics research’. But it is inconsistent to
reject all explicit evaluative exercises. Economists are happy working
with GNP per capita and real income metrics as proxies of welfare,
which uses market prices as the weights. But this is equally normative:
it is assumed that the welfare-value of a certain good for a person is
reflected by the price that the good commands on the market. This is
problematic, for reasons that have been explained repeatedly in the
literature. For one thing, market prices reflect demand and supply
(and thus relative scarcity of a good) — diamonds are expensive and
water (in non-drought-affected places) is cheap — but this doesn’t say
anything about their importance for our wellbeing. Moreover, market
prices do not take into account negative or positive welfare effects on
third parties, the so-called externalities, despite their omnipresence
(Hausman 1992).
Of course, it may be that, upon reflection of the various weights
available, some capability theorists will conclude that the set of
market prices, possibly combined with shadow prices for non-market
goods, is the best way to proceed. That is quite possible, and would
not be inconsistent with the general claim in the capability approach
that weights need to be chosen. The point is rather that the choice of
weights needs to be done in a reflective way, rather than simply using the
weighing scheme that is dominant or customary. I take it that this is the
point Sen is trying to make when he argues that “Welfare economics is
a major branch of ‘practical reason’” (Sen 1996, 61).16

16	Note also that for welfare economists, an important concern in examining and
developing a capabilitarian welfare economics will be the question of how it can be
formalized. On formalizations of the capability approach, see Sen (1985a); Kuklys
and Robeyns (2005); Basu and López-Calva (2011); Bleichrodt and Quiggin (2013).

4.10.3 Empirical possibilities and challenges
When Amartya Sen introduced the capability approach in economics,
there was some scepticism about its potential for empirical research. For
example, Robert Sugden (1993, 1953) famously wrote:
Given the rich array of functionings that Sen takes to be relevant, given
the extent of disagreement among reasonable people about the nature
of the good life, and given the unresolved problem of how to value
sets, it is natural to ask how far Sen’s framework is operational. Is it
a realistic alternative to the methods on which economists typically
rely — measurement of real income, and the kind of practical cost-benefit
analysis which is grounded in Marshallian consumer theory?

What Sugden and other early welfare economic critics of the capability
approach, such as John Roemer (1996, 191–93) were looking for, is
a theory that is fully formalised and provides a neat algorithm to
address questions of evaluation and/or (re-)distribution, resulting in
a complete ranking of options. That requires two things: first, to be
able to put the capability approach in a fully formalized model which
can be econometrically estimated. This requires us to move beyond
the welfare economic models as we know them, and may also require
the collection of new data (Kuklys 2005). In addition, it requires us to
accept that the different dimensions (functionings and/or capabilities)
are commensurable, that is, have a common currency that allows us to
express the value of one unit of one dimension in relation to the value
of one unit of another dimension. One-dimensional or aggregated
evaluative spaces are, ultimately, a necessary condition for conducting
empirical work in contemporary mainstream welfare economics. Yet
there may well be a trade-off between the number of dimensions and the
informational richness of the evaluative space on the one hand, and the
degree to which the theory can be formalised and can provide complete
orderings of interpersonal comparisons on the other hand. Some
welfare economists are working on the question of how to aggregate
the many dimensions such that one has, in the end, one composite
dimension to work with, but it should be obvious that this is not the
only way to develop capabilitarian welfare economics. The alternative
is to stick to the view that wellbeing is inherently multidimensional,

208

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

which requires other methods and techniques that allow for fuzziness,
vagueness and complexity (Chiappero-Martinetti 2008, 2000, 1994, 2006;
Clark and Qizilbash 2005; Qizilbash and Clark 2005). One could also
advance work on dominance rankings or incomplete rankings, which
Sen has been defending in his social choice work for several decades
(e.g. Sen 2017). As a consequence, there are several ways to develop a
capabilitarian welfare economics, and to make the capability approach
“operational” (Atkinson 1999, 185).
Sugden’s objection can be best answered by looking at the applications
that have already been developed, and which have been listed in
several overviews of the empirical literature (e.g. Kuklys and Robeyns
2005; Robeyns 2006b; Chiappero-Martinetti and Roche 2009; Lessmann
2012).17 However, whether the applications discussed in those surveys
satisfy the critics depends on what one expects from empirical work in
capabilitarian welfare economics. As was already shown in chapter 1,
empirical applications of the capability approach do make a substantive
difference to research using other normative frameworks, such as
income-based metrics. But from that it doesn’t follow that capabilitarian
welfare economics will be able to deliver alternatives for each and every
existing welfarist study in economics. It may well be that sometimes the
informational riches of the capability approach clash with requirements
regarding measurability that certain empirical applications put upon
the scholar.

4.10.4 Towards a heterodox capabilitarian
welfare economics?
In the last two sections, we discussed how the capability approach can
make a difference to contemporary welfare economics both theoretically
and empirically. Those debates by and large stay within the mainstream
of contemporary welfare economics, even though as Amartya Sen (1996,
61) notes, they require us “to go more and more in these pluralist and
17	In addition to the first, rather rough empirical application in the Appendix of Sen’s
(1985a) Commodities and Capabilities, the literature on empirical applications in
welfare economics that used individual-level data started off with the paper by
Schokkaert and Van Ootegem (1990), in which they showed that unemployment
benefits may restore an unemployed person’s income level, but do not restore all of
her functionings to the level they were at before she become unemployed.

4. Critiques and Debates



209

heterodox directions, taking note of a variety of information in making
the wide-ranging judgements that have to be made”. The reference
to ‘heterodoxy’ that Sen makes here is limited to the informational
basis of evaluations, yet in other work he has challenged some of the
behavioural assumptions underlying mainstream welfare economics
(e.g. Sen 1977a, 1985b). However, other economists believe that we need
a much more radical heterodox and pluralist turn in economics, which
would also affect meta-theoretical views, the range of methods that can
be used (e.g. including qualitative methods), giving up on the belief that
economics can be value-free, and engaging much more — and much
more respectfully — with the other social sciences, and indeed also with
the humanities. What can these heterodox economists expect from the
capability approach?
The answer to that question flows from the description of the
state of economics that was given in section 4.10.1. The unwillingness
of mainstream welfare economics to genuinely engage with other
disciplines (Fourcade, Ollion and Algan 2015; Nussbaum 2016) clashes
with the deeply interdisciplinary nature of the capability approach. The
modular view of the capability approach that was presented in chapter 2
makes it possible to see that a heterodox capabilitarian welfare economics
is certainly possible. It could not only, as all non-welfarist welfare
economics does, include functionings and/or capabilities as ends in the
evaluations (A1) and possibly include other aspects of ultimate value
too (A6), but it could also include a rich account of human diversity
(B3), a richly informed account of agency and structural constraints
(B4 and B5) and it could widen its meta-theoretical commitments
(B7) to become a discipline that is broader and more open to genuine
interdisciplinary learning. Yet the modular account also makes it very
clear that mainstream welfare economists can make a range of choices
in those modules that are more in line with the status quo in current
welfare economics, which would result in a very different type of
capabilitarian welfare economics.
In short, while both types of capabilitarian welfare economics will
depart in some sense from welfarist welfare economics, we are seeing
the emergence of both mainstream capabilitarian welfare economics and
heterodox capabilitarian welfare economics. The problem for the first
is that it will have few means of communication with other capability

210

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

theories, since it does not adopt many of the interdisciplinary choices
that most other capability theories make. The problem for the latter is
that it will not be taken seriously by mainstream economics, since it
does not meet the narrow requirements of what counts as economics
according to the vast majority of mainstream economists. Taking
everything together, a capabilitarian welfare economics is possible,
but (a) it will be harder to develop the capability approach in welfare
economics than in some other disciplines because of the methodological
and meta-theoretical clashes and restrictions, and (b) the difficult
position that welfare economics occupies within mainstream economics
will become even more challenging, since moving in the direction of the
capability approach conflicts with the criteria that the gatekeepers in
mainstream economists impose on anyone who wants to do something
considered ‘economics’. This may also explain why there is much less
work done in welfare economics on the capability approach, compared
to some other disciplines or fields in which the capability approach has
made a much bigger impact.

4.11 Taking stock
In this chapter, we have engaged with a range of critiques that have
been voiced about the capability approach, or debates that have
developed in the capability literature. While I hope that I have been
fair in representing all viewpoints, I have in many cases argued for a
particular way of looking at the problem, and in a significant number of
cases argued that critiques must be reformulated in order to be sound,
or did not sufficiently appreciate the modular structure of the general
capability approach or the distinction between the capability approach
and capability theories. Several of the critiques presented in this chapter
had bite as a critique of a particular type of capability theory, but not of
the capability approach in general.
The next and final (and very short!) chapter will not provide a
summary of the previous chapters, but rather offer some thoughts and
speculations on what the future of the capability approach could look
like, which issues will need to be addressed to unlock its full potential,
and which limitations will always need to be reckoned with.

5. Which Future for the
Capability Approach?

In the last two decades, much time and intellectual energy has been spent
on trying to answer some basic questions about the capability approach.
What difference does it make to existing normative frameworks? Can
it really make a difference to welfare economics as we know it? How
should we select capabilities, and how should these dimensions be
aggregated? Is the capability approach not too individualistic? Can
it properly account for power? And can it properly account for the
importance of groups and the collective nature of many processes that
are crucial for people’s capabilities?
I believe that many of the debates that kept capability scholars busy
in the last two decades have been settled, and we can move to another
phase in developing the capability approach and using it to study
the problems that need addressing. As many capability scholars have
acknowledged (sometimes implicitly) for a very long time, and as this
book has illustrated in detail, there are a variety of capability theories
possible. As a consequence, one capability theory does not need to be
a direct rival of another capability theory: we do not necessarily need
to choose between them, and it will often be a mistake to see them
as rivals. Many different capability theories can coexist. This theorypluralism should be embraced, rather than attacked by trying to put the
capability approach into a straightjacket. There is, of course, the real risk
that any theory that is somehow ‘broadening’ the informational basis
of evaluations and comparisons is seen as a capability theory — hence
a real risk of inflation. However, the modular understanding of the

212

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

capability approach clearly lays out the properties that every capability
theory, application or analysis should meet, and thereby provides a
powerful response to the risk of the inflation of the term ‘capability
theory’.
Having sorted all of this out, we are free to put the capability approach
to good use. It is impossible for one person to know all the interesting
paths that the capability approach should take (even if that one person
benefited from comments and many helpful discussions with others).
But as a start, let me just mention some lines of further thinking, research
and interventions that would be interesting to explore.
First, within the disciplines in which the capability has been discussed
and developed, there are plenty of opportunities to see what difference
it can make if pushed all the way to its limits. In some fields, such as
educational studies, the capability approach is well-developed and
widely applied. But there are others in which the capability approach
has so far merely been introduced, rather than being used to develop
mature and complete theories. One question, which remains unanswered
after our discussion in section 4.10, is whether the capability approach
can provide an equally powerful alternative to utility-based welfare
economics. In the literature on theories of justice, which we discussed
in section 3.13, the capability approach is widely debated, but there
are hardly any fully developed capabilitarian theories of justice, apart
from Nussbaum’s (2006b) and the theory of disadvantage by Wolff
and De-Shalit (2007). We need book-length accounts of capabilitarian
theories of justice, capabilitarian theories of institutional evaluation,
capabilitarian theories of welfare economics, and so forth.
Second, the capability approach is, so far, almost exclusively used
for evaluative and normative purposes — such as studies evaluating
whether certain people are better off than others, studies trying to
propose a certain policy or institution (for the effect it has on people’s
functionings and capabilities) rather than others, or studies arguing
for justice in terms of people’s capabilities. But one could also use
the capability approach for explanatory studies, e.g. to examine which
institutions or policies foster certain capabilities, or using the notions of
functionings and capabilities in the analysis of people’s behaviour and
decision making. For example, labour economists model the decision
about a person’s labour supply — how many hours she would be

5. Which Future for the Capability Approach?



213

willing to work — by looking at the costs and benefits of working more
or fewer hours, but wouldn’t it make much more sense to also ask how
the capabilities of different options compare? For example, many adults
are happy to work an equal number of hours for less pay if the work is
more intrinsically rewarding or if it contributes to the creation of a public
good. Another example is how we explain a parent’s decision not to use
formal child care, or to use it only for a very limited number of hours.
If we explain this exclusively in terms of financial costs and benefits (as
some policy analysts do) we don’t capture the fact that the capabilities
of affiliation and social relations are very different in the two scenarios.
A general model of people’s behaviour and decision-making should
therefore not only look at the pecuniary costs and benefits of different
options, but also at the different levels of valuable functionings, and the
absence of functionings with a negative value, that the different options
offer. The challenge of this approach is, of course, that capabilities are
often merely qualitative variables, and this hampers the explanatory
models that many social scientists use. But if our decision-making and
behaviour is largely influenced by the capabilities that characterize
different options, then surely, we should prefer (i) a more muddy and
vaguer explanatory model that takes all important aspects into account
above (ii) a more elegant and neat model that gives us a distorted
picture of how persons act and live.1 Some of this is already done, of
course, since there is a large literature about certain functionings taken
individually, e.g. in explanatory research on people’s health. The
suggestion I’m making here is to look at those functionings in a more
systematic way, and to integrate functionings and capabilities as general
categories in theories of behaviour and decision making, next to other
categories such as resources and preference-satisfaction.
Third, the capability approach may well have a very important role
to play in the current quest for a truly interdisciplinary conceptual
framework for the social sciences and humanities. Despite the fact
that universities are still to a large extent organized along disciplinary
lines, there is an increasing recognition that many important questions
cannot be studied properly without a unified framework or conceptual
language in which all the social sciences and humanities can find their
1	This is a methodological point that Amartya Sen has been pressing for a very long
time.

214

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

place. The capability approach may well form the nexus connecting
existing disciplinary frameworks, precisely because its concepts bring
together people’s wellbeing and the material resources they have, the
legal rules and social norms that constrain their capability sets, and so
forth. The approach thereby offers important conceptual and theoretical
bridges between disciplines. And it could also link evaluative and
normative frameworks to descriptive and explanatory frameworks,
rather than leaving the normative frameworks implicit, as is now too
often done in the social sciences.
Fourth, the capability approach should be more extensively used in
designing new policy tools. Citizens who endorse a broad understanding
of the quality of life that gives non-material aspects a central place have
been annoyed for many years by the constant assessment of economic
growth as an end in itself, rather than as a means to human flourishing
and the meeting of human needs. They have been saying, rightly in my
view, that whether economic growth is a good thing depends, among
other things, on how it affects the overall quality of life of people, as
well as how other public values fare, such as ecological sustainability,
and that we have very good reasons to take seriously the limits to
economic growth (Jackson 2016). But those who want to put the ends of
policies at the centre of the debate, and focus policy discussions more
on these ultimate ends rather than on means, need to move from mere
critique to developing tools that can fashion constructive proposals.
The alternatives to GDP, which I briefly discussed in chapter 1, are one
element that can help, but other tools are also needed.
Fifth, we have to investigate which capability theories are logically
possible, but empirically implausible. The argument in this book has
been that the capability approach can be developed in a wide range of
capability theories and applications, and is not committed to a particular
set of political or ideological commitments. But that is as far as its logical
structures go, and it doesn’t take a stance on empirical soundness. We
need to investigate which capability theories may be logically possible,
but nevertheless should be ruled out, given what we know about
the plausibility of our empirical assumptions regarding conversion
factors, human diversity, and structural constraints. It is highly likely
that there are capability theories that are logically conceivable, yet
inconsistent with some ‘basic facts’ about human nature and societies.

5. Which Future for the Capability Approach?



215

This is especially important since we want to avoid the hijacking of the
capability approach by powerful societal actors or organisations who
will start to propagate a very uncritical and reductionist version of
the approach, and push that as the only right interpretation of it. The
general account of the capability approach that I have defended in this
book tries to be as politically and ideologically neutral as possible; but
that doesn’t mean that I personally, as a scholar who has written a lot
on questions of injustice, believe that all possible capability theories are
equally plausible. In fact, my own substantive work in which I have
used the capability approach confirms that I do not, and that I think that
a critical account of social structures and power is needed (e.g. Robeyns
2003, 2010, 2017b, 2017a). But I think we should then argue directly about
the unjust nature of social structures, economic institutions, or social
norms. I hope that the modular view presented in this book makes clear
that many of the intellectual and ideological battles actually take place
in arguing about the B-modules and the C-modules.
Sixth and finally, the capability approach should be used in guiding
existing practices on the ground, in many different segments of society,
and in many different societies of the world. This is not easy, since there
are quite significant challenges for theorists to bridge the gap between
their work and practices on the ground, as several theorists who
engaged in such theory-practice collaborations have pointed out (e.g.
Koggel 2008; Wolff 2011). Yet if the capability approach aspires to make
a difference in practice — which many capability scholars do — then
thinking carefully about how to move to practice without diluting the
essence of the framework is crucial. Luckily, there are signs that more
of these ‘on-the-ground applications’ are being developed, and that the
capability approach is not only of interest to scholars and policy makers,
but also for practitioners and citizens. One example is Solava Ibrahim’s
(2017) recent model for grassroots-led development, which is primarily
a conceptual and theoretical framework, yet is also based on ten years
of fieldwork. Another example is the practical field of social work in
the Netherlands, where social work professionals have recently argued
that the field is in need of a new moral compass, in order to counter the
technocratic developments that, it is argued, have dominated changes in
social work in recent decades. Some social workers argue that the human
rights framework could provide a useful theory (Hartman, Knevel and

216

Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice

Reynaert 2016), while others believe that capabilities could be helpful in
restoring ethical and political dimensions to the practice of social work
(Braber 2013). As the discussion in section 3.14 has shown, there need
not be a conflict between those two frameworks. Yet it remains to be
seen in the years to come if and how the capability approach is able to
guide the effective change of the entire sector of social work in countries
where the traditional welfare state is under pressure.
However, with all these future extensions of the capability approach,
it remains important to explicitly acknowledge its limitations. This
book has shown what the capability approach has to offer, but also
what needs to be added before the vague and underspecified capability
framework can be developed into a more powerful capability theory or
capability application. Especially the choices made in the B-modules,
but also the additions made in the C-modules C1 (additional
explanatory and ontological theories) and C4 (additional normative
claims and principles) will be crucial for many capabilitarian theories
and applications to become powerful.
There is no point in pretending that the capability approach can do
more than it is able to do, since this would blind us to the necessary
collaborations with other theories and insights that are needed. It is
in those collaborations with complementary powerful theories and
frameworks that the success of the future of the capability approach lies.

across research, policy and practice in the global North and South, and across many decades
of debate and discussion within and outside the capability approach. It does so in a way which
is readable and clear, and it manages to avoid on the one hand being too polemical, and on
the other hand being too superﬁcial. Ingrid Robeyns is uniquely well-placed to write such a
book, being herself a well-established inter-disciplinary scholar whose work has contributed
enormously to the development of the capability approach over the years. It has been a
frustration for many of us that no comprehensive textbook on the capability approach yet
exists, and this will ﬁll that gap admirably.
—Prof Tania Burchardt, Director of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE) and Associate
Professor in the Department of Social Policy at the London School of Economics

How do we evaluate ambiguous concepts such as wellbeing, freedom, and social jus�ce?
How do we develop policies that oﬀer everyone the best chance to achieve what they want
from life? The capability approach, a theore�cal framework pioneered by the philosopher
and economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s, has become an increasingly inﬂuen�al way to think
about these issues.
Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice is both an introduc�on to the capability approach and
a thorough evalua�on of the challenges and disputes that have engrossed the scholars who
have developed it. Ingrid Robeyns oﬀers her own illumina�ng and rigorously interdisciplinary
interpreta�on, arguing that by apprecia�ng the dis�nc�on between the general capability
approach and more speciﬁc capability theories or applica�ons we can create a powerful and
ﬂexible tool for use in a variety of academic disciplines and ﬁelds of policymaking.
This book provides an original and comprehensive account that will appeal to scholars of
the capability approach, new readers looking for an interdisciplinary introduc�on, and those
interested in theories of jus�ce, human rights, basic needs, and the human development
approach.
