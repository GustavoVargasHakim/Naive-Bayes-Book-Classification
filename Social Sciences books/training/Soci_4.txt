WELLBEING AS AN ISSUE
Wellbeing has been identified as a serious issue for principals,
teachers and students within educational contexts. The problem of
principal health and wellbeing has also been recognised at both
national and state levels in Australia for the at least a decade and
has been acknowledged as an issue of concern by the state, private,
and independent school sectors. The first full scale independent
study into the occupational health, safety and wellbeing of
Australia’s school principals paints a pretty grim picture about the
current work conditions for Australia’s school leadership (Riley,
2014). The survey of 2,049 principals found that along with threats
and acts of violence, school principals are also more likely to be
bullied, and are dealing with ever-increasing volumes of work and
health problems due to stress (Riley, 2014). Phillips and Sen (2011,
cited in Riley, 2014) reported that, “work related stress was higher
in education than across all other industries…with work-related
mental ill-health…almost double the rate for all industry” (p. 177-8).
This trend appears to be continuing, with another report

suggesting that that in Queensland over $10 million has been paid
in five years to stressed teachers and that teachers are making
more mental stress claims than in any other industry (Worksafe
Queensland, 2013, as cited in Acton & Glasgow, 2015). Reducing
these impacts of work stress in the teaching profession has been
the focus of much research in education. Although historically
resilience to stress has been the main focus of studies, research in
the area has recently shifted towards the school wide promotion of
wellbeing (Powell & Graham, 2017).

Within the wellbeing literature, there is a shared view that
educational contexts are best positioned to reach out to everyone
and explicitly teach and promote wellbeing, potentially arresting
trends of reported declining student and teacher wellbeing (Acton
& Glasgow, 2015; Hogan, Thompson, Sellar, & Lingard, 2018),
principal wellbeing (Riley, 2014), or of feeling of not belonging
(Allen, Kern, Vella-Brodrick, Hattie, & Waters, 2018; Seligman,
Ernst, Gillham, Reivch & Linkins, 2009). There is, however, a lack of
consensus as to the application and delivery of wellbeing programs
within educational systems and educational contexts (Powell &
Graham, 2017) and it is in this space that we hope to make
worthwhile contribution.

INTRODUCTION
Educational contexts (e.g., schools, special education units and
early childhood centres) are places of social hope capital, a place
and space where people can inspire positive thinking, engage in
educational growth and the sustainment of wellbeing.
Considerable research suggests that the promotion of wellbeing,

CONNECTING AND ACTIVATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE

is a core role of schools and teachers are in a prime position to
recognise changes indicative of wellbeing concerns.
The quality of life or wellbeing of an individual or community is a
function of the actual conditions of that life and what an individual
or community makes of those conditions. What a person or
community makes of those conditions is in turn a function of how
the conditions are perceived, what is thought and felt about those
conditions, what is done and, finally, what consequences follow
from all these inputs. People’s perceptions, thoughts, feelings and
actions, then, have an impact on their own and others’ living
conditions (Michalos, 2007, p.4).
Prior to embarking on this journey of exploring wellbeing within
educational contexts, this Chapter will connect with your prior
knowledge on wellbeing and explore your own sense of wellbeing.

CONNECTING WITH YOUR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
Connecting and activating pertinent prior knowledge assembles
bridges connecting knowledge already integrated into
understanding of a topic, and new knowledge, thus enabling
learning through the creation of mental hooks that assist to anchor
new instructional concepts, processes and skills (Andersen, 2018).
Mazano (2004) contends that linking to prior expertise or
knowledge in any sphere, increases the quantity of requisite
knowledge that is accessible for use when bearing in mind new
information, queries, questions or challenges. Further to this
Campbell and Campbell (2009) pose that this is the reason some
individuals with great expertise are more likely to ponder multiple
perspectives of matters, queries, questions or problems and reach
additional reasoned answers than novices. Re-examining prior
knowledge shapes firm foundations on which to develop new
learning experiences, and supports self-worth, reducing feelings

of ignorance or general lack of ability, as new stimulating options
are created when linkages are made between past ideas and new
information (Andersen, 2018). Activating and connecting pertinent
prior knowledge is vital in setting the scene.

CONNECTING WITH YOURSELF
Being familiar to your inner signals and values and recognising how
your feelings impact on you, contributes towards understanding
your own wellbeing, as well as understanding the holistic complex
situation that is wellbeing within a wider educational context. As
such self-awareness is a key foundation block essential to
understanding personal wellbeing and the wellbeing of individuals,
teams and the school community (Andersen, 2018). Self-awareness
is required for creating trusting relationships and promoting
wellbeing. If we don’t know ourselves, it becomes increasing
difficult to know, understand and effectively assist someone else.
According to Eurich (2017), self-awareness is “the ability to see
ourselves clearly, understand who we are, how other see us, and
how we fit into the world” (Eurich, 2017, p.4). Covey (2004) expands
this further by explaining self-awareness as the ability to accurately
understand and reflect upon one’s own skills, knowledge, feelings,
and behaviour, and then enact this insight to identify strengths and
to try and mitigate any weaknesses. The notion of self-awareness
posed by Goleman (2005), goes beyond just such passive actions, to
advocacy for a strong basis in proactive action, where self-informed
individuals exercise agency to craft intentional and informed
decisions and choices monitoring and controlling their thoughts
and subliminal biases. Eurich (2013), explains that this proactive
active action involves two different forms of self-awareness:
1. Internal self-awareness – knowing and understanding
yourself (Eurich, 2017).
2. External self-awareness – knowing how other people
perceive you and perceiving yourself accurately from
other’s perspectives (Eurich, 2017).
An individual’s ability to perceive, identify and manage emotions
provides the basis for the types of social and emotional

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

12

competencies needed for successful personal and professional
conversations (Reiss, 2009). The identity of self influences the
perspectives of others and can have a powerful impact on one’s
efforts to collaboratively work with others and support, enhance,
and promote their wellbeing. It is therefore important to ask
yourself who you are and understand how you can and will engage
with others in a caring professional and educative manner. It
through knowing yourself and being aware of what is important
to you (i.e., your values, and beliefs), that you can behave
authentically when engaging with others in both personal and
professional relationships (Andersen, 2018).
Understanding the wellbeing of others in the first instance often
commences with an understanding yourself.
Key Questions

•

How would you rate your own wellbeing? Is this accurate? What evidence do you
use to validate this? Would others see you the same way?

•

What are your core values? How are they aligned / or not aligned to your context’s
core values? How does this impact / or not impact on your wellbeing?

•

What do you stand for? What principles guide you? How do they impact / or not
impact on your wellbeing?

Activity

•

Rochat’s (2003) extensive study on the development of self-awareness offers
one way of conceptualising levels of self-awareness, and how self-awareness
develops over time as a result of life experiences (see Table 1.2). Where would
you place your level of self-awareness? What evidence do you have to support

Le
vel

Rochat’s Levels of
Development

Description

0

Confusion

Having no self- awareness or understanding of a how
individual actions connect to, or impact on the environment.

1

Differentiation

At this level there is an awareness of a difference between
what is perceived by self and what is reflected in an
environment, and gaining a sense of how self is situated relative to
that environment.

2

Situation

A growing understanding that the results of self-produced
actions can be observed in, and can impact on the impact on the
environment.

Identification

Basic self-awareness. Consciousness and active gathering and
processing information from the environment with a focus on the
reality (impact) of own behaviour. Identification of own feelings,
physical sensations, reactions, habits, behaviours and thoughts.
Understanding of how self is managed and how one engages with
other people.

Permanence

A recognition that this is me and I am stuck with it
(sometimes). The self is able to be identified beyond the moment
and the here and now. At this level self manifests as enduring,
while also at the same time being responsive to changes over time.
This is the point where changes can be made; an appreciation is
developed of reasons for past behaviour or self-protection
systems; vulnerabilities that were had at that time are recognised
and acknowledged; and negative and positive core beliefs
identified.

3

4

5

Self-consciousness
or meta
self-awareness

A realisation that this is the “me” that everyone else sees
and that “I” have come to terms with that. At this level individuals
are fully aware of who they are, how they present and how they
are perceived in the minds of others. Self-consciousness or meta
self-awareness provides opportunities to make changes that make
a real difference and as self-aware individuals are also open to
further evaluation of how they are perceived.

We acknowledge that a journey in self-discovery can at times be
challenging, an understanding of self creates deeper authenticity
in professional relationships and wellbeing conversations by
developing more complex internal mechanisms for knowing when

14

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

and how to engage with other people. The understanding of self
is not a “one off” epiphany or process. It is a life-long learning
journey that involves hard work, takes considerable practice, may
be emotionally painful at times when a person recognises and
acknowledges their strengths and weaknesses, takes time to
master but most importantly it is worthwhile work. You may find
that you may need to utilise the learning activities above many
times as you grow as a learner.

THIS TEXT
This text focuses on wellbeing in educational contexts as
educational contexts play a pivotal role in teaching students about
nonviolence, promoting understanding of diversity, endowing
people with a shared purpose and meaning and the skills and
behaviours to create a more inclusive, healthy, and positive future
(Niemi, Lavonen, Kallioniemi, & Toom, 2018). Weare (2013) affirms
the words of Maslow (1970), averring that there is significantly
important to satisfy an individual’s social emotional needs before
concentrating on the academic needs. The Queensland
Department of Education and Training {DET} (2018) reiterates the
importance of catering for an individual’s needs, posing that
students learn best in environments where their social, emotional
and physical wellbeing is nurtured. So how do we do this?
To generate real educational context community purpose there
needs to be a shared understanding of purpose, a clear vision
and a common language around established ways of working that
positively contribute to building a safe, inclusive culture where
wellbeing is fore-fronted. At the start of each chapter we posed
guiding questions for you to consider. In chapter one we outline
a possible way of meaning making using the text; chapter two
explores some theoretical conceptualisations of wellbeing (guiding
question: what is wellbeing?); chapter three presents policy,

CONNECTING AND ACTIVATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE

15

frameworks and legislation that has informed the focus on
wellbeing (guiding question: how is wellbeing enacted?); chapter
four outlines possible impactors and enablers to wellbeing (guiding
question: how is wellbeing enhanced?); chapter five explores
embedding an education wide focus on wellbeing (guiding
question: how is wellbeing enacted and embedded?) and the final
chapter, chapter six, explores the ecological and contextual
analysis of wellbeing in relation to a workplace wellbeing
framework (guiding question: how can wellbeing be enacted and
promoted in my context?).
We hope that you love learning with us and we invite you to
contact us in the hope of co-constructing knowledge and
understandings that are helpful in educational contexts.

Theoretical Conceptualisations of
Wellbeing
SUSAN CARTER AND CECILY ANDERSEN

Key Concepts:

•

There is a lack of consensus in the literature as to exactly what wellbeing is, as well
as an array of wellbeing models.

•

The challenge is for educational contexts to clearly define wellbeing and select or
develop a model of the concept before trying to implement wellbeing programs.

broader societal context. This
Chapter will explore the
following questions: What does the concept of wellbeing mean?
Does the term wellbeing have the same meaning for all individuals
and groups within a school? Does the concept of wellbeing hold
constant across time and events despite the diversity of
experiences, culture, beliefs and values evident within educational
contexts? What foundational approaches and models inform
wellbeing educational initiatives? And what is the role of education
in the wellbeing of student and staff? In exploring the above
questions, the theoretical concept of wellbeing will be explored by
examining definitions of wellbeing, wellness and mental health;
investigating theoretical conceptualisations of wellbeing; and by
exploring subjective wellbeing as an approach to fostering
wellbeing an examining the place of wellbeing in educational
contexts.

THEORETICAL CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF WELLBEING

19

WHAT IS WELLBEING?
The seeking of a definition for wellbeing is a complex pursuit, as
increasingly it is utilised in conversations, on the community and
global media, and within the literature, in many different ways, with
wellbeing seemingly taking shape as a chameleon (Carter, 2016).
Originally there appeared two specific schools of thought where
wellbeing was seen either as hedonic or eudemonic.
From a hedonic view, focusing on happiness can be seen as
the totality of pleasurable moments. Philosophers such as Hobbes
viewed wellbeing as “a pursuit of human appetites”, DeSade held
that it was the “pursuit of sensations and pleasure” and Bentham
claimed that “through maximising pleasure and self-interest that
the good society is built” (cited in Husain, 2008). Other philosophers
held a somewhat different view, deeming that people experience
happiness in the expression of their virtues, engaged in what they
believe is worth doing (Carter, 2016). This notion of eudemonia –
being true to one’s inner self can be equated with an eudemonic
perspective of wellbeing. Building upon the eudemonic view of
wellbeing is Maslow’s (1970) concept of self- actualization and Deci
and Ryan’s (2000) self-determination theory. An individual’s or
community’s quality of life is a direct function of the conditions
that arise in life, and how an individual or community utilises the
conditions that life presents. How an individual or community
perceives the condition, thinks and feels about those conditions,
what is done and, ultimately, what consequences follow from all
these inputs in turn becomes a function of how the conditions are
perceived. People’s perceptions, their feelings, their thoughts, and
their actions, then, have a direct impact on their own and others’
living conditions (Michalos, 2007).
McCallum and Price (2016) argue that wellbeing has emerged as
“something everyone seemingly aims for, and arguably has a right
to” (McCallum & Price, 2016, p.2). While wellbeing is not a new
concept, it has become an important concept within contemporary

20

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

school community contexts. However, identifying an agreed
definition of wellbeing, in addition to establishing a consensus on
how quality wellbeing can be achieved and sustained, is far more
problematic with the term wellbeing often poorly defined and
under-theorised (Camfield, Streuli & Woodhead, 2009). To
compound the issue of definition inconsistency, wellbeing is often
used interchangeably with other terms such as ‘happiness’,
‘flourishing’, ‘enjoying a good life’ and ‘life satisfaction’, all which
have very different interpretations and underlying meanings.
Bradburn (1969) (as cited in Dodge, Daly, Huyton & Saunders,
2012) defined wellbeing as being present when an individual is high
in psychological wellbeing, where an excess of positivity (positive
affect) predominates over negative affect. In contrast, Shah and
Marks (2004) argued that wellbeing is more than just positive affect
(happiness, feeling satisfied), with feeling fulfilled and developing
as a person an equally important aspect in defining wellbeing.
Diener et al. (1999) extend the definition of wellbeing even further
by defining wellbeing as subjective (thus the term subjective
wellbeing, {SWB}) more specifically as consisting of three essential
interrelated components: life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and
unpleasant affect.
The characteristic intensity with which people perceive their
affective states, has no bearing on overall subjective well-being
(Larsen, Diener & Emmons, 1985). It seems that the predominant
predictor of overall SWB is the rate of positive compared to
negative states in a person’s life, throughout time (Larsen, Diener,
& Emmons, 1985). “Because subjective well-being refers to affective
experiences and cognitive judgments, self-report measures of
subjective wellbeing are indispensable” (Larsen & Eid, 2008, p. 4).
Together with his associates Ed Diener designed the Satisfaction
with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), which
developed into the standard measure of life satisfaction in the
wellbeing field. The implications concerning the measurement of
SWB are that:

consistency and authority (Larsen & Eid, 2008).
2. Each measurement method has drawbacks and benefits
(Larsen & Eid, 2008).
3. Comprehensive assessment of SWB necessitates a
multimethod assessment tool (Diener, 2009; Diener & Eid,
2006).
Diener (2006) suggested that people over emphasise their
emotional intensity and underestimate and underrate the
frequency of their positive affect when recollecting emotional
moments. This research signifies that there is no single cause of
SWB. It seems apparent then, that certain conditions appear to
be essential for high SWB {e.g., mental health, positive social
relationships}, but are not singularly sufficient to cause happiness
(Diener, 2006). Diener’s work has detected a number of
circumstances that seem to be required for, or correlated with
happiness, however no one condition or characteristic is adequate
to ensure happiness in itself (Larsen & Eid, 2008).
It should be noted that there is evidence that diverse
circumstances and outcomes make people happy. Diener and
colleagues have shown that the links to happiness alter between
young versus old people (Diener, 2000). So what makes a younger
person happy may not make an older person happy. Likewise,
Diener, Suh, Smith, and Shao (1995) reported that there are
different connections to happiness in differing cultures. Diener
(2000) has suggested that that there are likely universals, such as
experiencing close positive social relationships that are associated
with happiness by almost everyone. Larsen and Eid (2008, p 8.)
cleverly suggest a cooking analogy explaining that when cooking
some ingredients are essential, many just enhance flavour or
texture but no singular ingredient, produces the desired outcome,

22

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

rather all ingredients need to come together in the right way for
success to be achieved.
SWB appears to contribute to beneficial outcomes in life. Diener
(2000), along with his colleagues has determined that happy people
are more creative and sociable; have increased likelihood of
longevity; display generally sturdier immune systems; earn more
money; are good leaders; and display generally better citizenship in
their workplace. Furthermore, numerous positive outcomes were
linked to happiness, such as marital satisfaction, job satisfaction,
and improved coping. Therefore, high SWB is particularly desirable
at individual, at educational system levels, and at societal levels.
It therefore makes sense to invest in promoting a culture in
educational contexts where wellbeing is important. This text will
aim to explore, how educational contexts can create a culture
where SWB is valued, and high levels of SWB are desired as
outcomes, planned for and hopefully achieved.
McCallum and Price (2016) propose an even more encompassing
definition of wellbeing outlining it as diverse and fluid, respecting
the beliefs and values of individual, family, and community; and
experiences, culture, opportunities, and contexts across time and
change.
They aver that it encompasses interwoven
environmental, collective, and individual elements that interact
across a lifespan (McCallum & Price, 2016). Despite a range of
notions encompassed in wellbeing definitions, wellbeing can then
be described in very broad terms as a holistic, balanced life
experience where wellbeing needs to be considered in relation
to how an individual feels and functions across several areas,
including cognitive, emotional, social, physical, and spiritual
wellbeing.
Key Questions

THEORETICAL CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF WELLBEING

23

How does your context define wellbeing?

•

How do these definitions align or not align with you own definition of wellbeing and
why?

WHAT IS WELLNESS?
The term wellness is often used interchangeably with the term
wellbeing (McCallum & Price, 2016). However, Roscoe (2009)
argues that wellness is not the same as wellbeing, and instead
contributes to it, as wellness is the sum of the positive steps taken
to achieve wellbeing.
Key Question

•

Do you agree with Roscoe’s statement and why / why not ?

The term wellness was first introduced by Dunn (1959) (as cited
in Kirkland, 2014), who argued that health was much more than
the absence of disease, and remains the cornerstone of today’s
concept of wellness. Dunn defined wellness in terms of the
integration of the whole person – the body, mind and spirit, with
wellness described as different spiritual, cognitive, emotional,
environmental and physical aspects (refer to Figure 2.2), all of
which combine to form wellness (Albrecht, 2014).

Roscoe (2009) identified the above core principles of wellness,
depicted in Figure 2.2:
1. Wellness is dynamic, and changing and evident on many
levels.
2. A range of factors work in combination to form wellness.

3. Wellness emerges from the integrative and dynamic
whole rather than from the sum of its parts.
4. Environmental contexts impact wellness.
5. Life-span developmental changes affect wellness.
6. Awareness, education and growth are central to the
paradigm of wellness.
Key Questions

•

How are definitions of wellness different to, or the same as definitions of
wellbeing?

•

Where and how does wellness fit into the conceptualisation of wellbeing?

WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?
A similar lack of consensus is also evident when defining mental
health. Bhugra, Till and Sartorius (2013) describe mental health as
an integral and essential part of overall health which can be defined
in at least three ways including: the absence of disease; a balance
within oneself and balance between oneself and one’s physical and
social environment; and finally a state of being that allows for the
full performance of all its mental and physical functions (Bhurga,
Dill & Satorius, 2013). Watson, Emery, Bayliss, Boushel & McInnes,
2012) similarly define mental health as a state of being that also
includes the biological, psychological or social factors which
contribute to an individual’s mental state and ability to function
within the environment. The World Health Organisation {WHO}
(2007) extends the definition of mental health further to include

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

26

realising one’s potential; the ability to cope with normal life
stresses; and community contributions as core components of
mental health. Other definitions also extend beyond this to include
intellectual, emotional and spiritual development, positive selfperception, feelings of self-worth and physical health, and
intrapersonal harmony as key aspects in defining metal mental
(Bhurga et al., 2013).

WELLBEING
While many theoretical constructs of wellbeing exist, two
conceptual approaches to wellbeing research now tend to
dominate the field of research and discussion.Objective wellbeing
theories tend to define wellbeing in terms of objective, external
and universal notions of quality of life indicators such as social
attributes {health, education, social networks and connections} and
material resources {income, food and housing} (Watson et al.,
2012). Objective theories of wellbeing largely arise from Amartya
Sen’s work in welfare economics, and tend to focus on agreed core
human capabilities necessary for quality life such as body health
and integrity; the ability to think and imagine; the ability to express
emotions; the ability to exercise practical reasoning and autonomy
in contributing to one’s own education, work and political and
social participation (Bourke & Geldens, 2007).
In contrast, subjective theories of wellbeing are focused on
subjective overall life evaluations, and comprise two main
components – affect {feelings, emotions and mood} and life
satisfaction, which is identified as a distinct construct and defined
relative to specific domains in life {such as school, work and family}
(Diener & Ryan, 2009). Affect is dived further into positive and
negative emotions, with subjective wellbeing experienced when
a predominance of positive emotions occurs more than negative
emotions (Diener et al., 1999). As people and perceptions are at the
heart of the meaning of subjective wellbeing, Watson et al. (2012)
argue that subjective wellbeing has direct utility in describing and
facilitating staff and student social and emotional wellbeing. The
following contemporary models of wellbeing outline frameworks
for exploring wellbeing.

28

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

TRIPARTITE MODEL OF SUBJECTIVE WELLBEING
Diener and Ryan’s (2009) Tripartite Model of Subjective Wellbeing
(refer to Figure 2.4) presents wellbeing as a general evaluation of
an individual’s quality of life in terms of three key components:
1. Life satisfaction, which is composed of: Imperfect
assessment of the balance between positive and negative
affect in one’s life. An assessment of how well one’s life
measures up to aspirations and goals;
2. Positive affect (pleasurable feelings); and
3. Negative affect (painful feelings).

Pais-Riberiro (2011). Cognitive, affective and contextual predictors of
subjective wellbeing. International Journal of Wellbeing, 2(1), 34-53, p.38.

is a

THEORETICAL CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF WELLBEING

representation of the relationship between SWB and cognitive,
affective and cultural variables.

SELIGMAN’S PERMA WELLBEING MODEL
Seligman’s (2011) PERMA model (refer to Figure 2.5) proposes that
wellbeing has several measurable elements, each contributing to
wellbeing. The PERMA model identifies five essential elements to
wellbeing:
1. Positive emotions include a wide range of feelings, not
just happiness and joy {P}.
2. Engagement refers to involvement in activities that draws
and builds upon one’s interests {E}.
3. Positive Relationships are all important in promoting
positive emotions, whether they are work-related, school
related, familial, romantic, or platonic {R}.
4. Meaning also known as purpose, and prompts the
question of “why” {M}.
5. Achievement / accomplishment are the pursuit of success
and mastery {A}.

MCCALLUM AND PRICE’S MODEL OF HOLISTIC WELLBEING
McCallum and Price (2016) outlined a model of holistic wellbeing
where the student is central. They suggest that the model captures
the interplay between learner wellbeing, educator wellbeing, and
community wellbeing. Six key principles are identified together with
six key strategies as the means of enactment in nurturing wellbeing
in education.

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

30

1. Positive relationships – building and sustaining healthy
relationships.

2. Positive strengths – developing and nurturing individual
and group strengths.

3. Positive communication – establishing effective and safe
communication strategies.

4. Positive behaviour – behaving in a way that welcomes

a sense of belonging and connections to others and
positive, peaceful and caring action.

5. Positive emotion – nurturing emotional health.
6. Positive leadership – scaffolding wellbeing through
growing leaders with a democratic leadership style.

(McCallum & Price, 2016, p. 144).

SCHOOL COMMUNITY WELLBEING
Educational contexts are now key stakeholders in promoting
student and staff wellbeing, regardless of the diversity of wellbeing
definitions and approaches. McCallum and Price (2016) argue that
given the link between wellbeing and academic achievement,
educators, policy and curriculum developers, it is no surprise that
educational contexts are being increasingly challenged to centre
wellbeing as both a foundation to, and integral part of learning.
As a result, an increasing an emphasis is now being placed on
producing successful and confident learners, resulting in a more
holistic approach to education in order to support both academic
achievement and wellbeing of students. McCallum and Price (2016)
also suggest that wellbeing education is for the whole community
and have proposed a Wellbeing education model which supports
that notion by suggesting that wellbeing education is an essential
provider to academic learning and achievement (McCallum & Price,

THEORETICAL CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF WELLBEING

31

2016). We believe that wellbeing education goes beyond this and is
essential to the creation of social hope and social capital.

32

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

THEORETICAL CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF WELLBEING

33

Figure 2.5 Photograph of a person by Warren Wong on unsplash

Supportive educational environments must now promote the
wellbeing of learners by assisting them to develop a positive sense
of identity, agency, self-worth and connectedness within their
community. Learners, educators, communities and educational
institutions hold responsibility in this regard. Scoffham and Barnes
(2011) noted that the challenge for today’s educators is to provide
a place as well as programs that are both secure and demanding,
and based upon pedagogy that furthers the present and future
wellbeing and happiness of the children and young people within
positive social and environmental change contexts.

Key Questions

•

Has your definition of wellbeing changed or not changed and if so why and how?

•

What factors influence your wellbeing definition?

CONCLUSION
Despite the range of notions encompassed in wellbeing definitions
explored throughout this chapter, we believe that wellbeing is
experienced differently by different people. We embrace Diener’s
(2009) definition that wellbeing consists of three elements that
involve the cognitive evaluation of overall satisfaction with life;
positive affect; and lower levels of negative affect. Wellbeing can
be viewed holistically, in terms of balanced life experience where,

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

34

wellbeing needs to be considered in relation to how an individual
feels and functions across several areas, including cognitive,
emotional, social, physical and spiritual wellbeing. As authors we
hope that readers are challenged to deeply ponder how they define
wellbeing. As educational contexts are now key stakeholders in
promoting children, young people and staff wellbeing, it is no
surprise that educational communities are being increasingly
challenged to centre wellbeing as both a foundation to, and integral
part of an educational context’s structures, processes and
learning. The challenge for educational contexts then is to clearly
define wellbeing; select or develop a model of wellbeing that
promotes the wellbeing of students (children / young people) and
staff; and develop a positive sense of identity, agency, self-worth
and connectedness.

INTRODUCTION
National and state policy reports have indicated that many
Australian students, teachers and leaders are experiencing
difficulty maintaining their wellbeing. As educational contexts (e.g.,
schools, special education units and early childhood centres)
represent a major component of Australia’s society and economy,
it is no surprise then that national and international concern
regarding the social and emotional wellbeing of children, young
people and educators has now become a major focus in a wide
range of international and Australian policy initiatives. As a
consequence, interest has increased in the role educational
contexts and educators play in promoting student wellbeing, and
the interface that occurs between policy and practice when
implementing wellbeing programs in schools. This Chapter
explores Australian and international legislation, policy, and
frameworks which inform a focus on wellbeing.

Before we examine policy, framework and legislation that informs a focus on wellbeing, how
would you define each of the preceding terms?

Consider how the literature defines policy, framework and
legislation, alongside the understandings you have of the concepts.
Bacchi (2000) defined the term policy as a “discourse of ideas or
plans that form the basis for making decisions to accomplish goals
that are deemed worthwhile” (p.46). Cochran and Malone (2010)
described policy in terms of the actions of government, and the
intentions that determine those actions. Birkland (2016) espoused
that the term policy referred to a plan of what to do, that has been
agreed to officially, by either a group of people, an organisation or a
government, in order to achieve a set of goals. In contrast, the term
framework has been conceptualised in a number of different ways.
Coburn and Turner (2011) described a framework as an abstract,
logical structure of meaning that guides action, and includes
identification of key concepts, and the relationships between those
concepts. On the other hand, Garrison (2011) considered a
framework to be a set of beliefs, rules or ideas that outline what
actions can be undertaken. White (2010) presented an alternate
viewpoint, that a wellbeing framework is “a social process with
material, relational, and subjective dimensions” (p.158), that can be
assessed at individual and collective levels, with relationships at
the centre. Compared to above, the term legislation is more simply
defined as all Bill and Acts passed and subordinate legislation made
by government.

How effectively is this applied?

LEGISLATION INFORMING A FOCUS ON
WELLBEING
McCallum and Price (2016) argue that at local, national and
international levels, all children and young people have the right
to an education that supports their wellbeing and development.
As a consequence, improving the wellbeing and developmental
outcomes of Australia’s children have become a key priority for
Australian governments (Kyriacou, 2012). We will now explore
legislation that impacts on the notion of wellbeing for children,
young people and educational contexts (e.g., schools, special
education units and early childhood centres).

AUSTRALIAN LEGISLATION
There are two key pieces of international legislation: Education
and Child Protection Acts; and Australian Human Rights and Equal
Opportunity Act 1986.

EDUCATION AND CHILD PROTECTION ACTS
The most significant pieces of guiding legislation for educational
contexts across Australia are jurisdictional Education (General
Provisions) Acts, which set out the conditions and requirements

42

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

for the provision of education, and Child Protection Acts which
set out protection for children and young people. However, while
wellbeing is not referred to specifically in these acts, there is an
underlying principle that guides both legislation and any
subsequent policy on education, children and young people that
falls out from legislation. The principle that governments must
operate in “best interests of the child” is evident across all
jurisdictions (Powell & Graham, 2017). (Your jurisdiction’s Education
and Child Protection Acts can be located by searching for the
relevant Act from your jurisdiction).

AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ACT
1986
The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986,
overseen by the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission {HREOC}, plays a role in protecting and promoting the
rights of children and young people within Australia. While the Act
does not specifically promote wellbeing, it does refer to the right to
an education and also provides policy and recourses to specifically
to support the prevention of bullying, harassment and racism.

INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION
There are three key pieces of international legislation that have
influenced the Australian landscape: the Convention on the Rights
of the Child, United Kingdom Children’s Act 2004; and No Child Left
Behind Act 2001.

THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD
The International Year of the Child (1979) brought commitment
by national and international governments and organisations to
extend human rights to children. As a consequence, the United
Nations United General Assembly {UNGA} (1989) Convention on
the Rights of the Child {CRC} (1989) was developed. The CRC
emphasized the civil and political rights of individual children as
well as economic, social, and cultural rights; the right to be raised
in peace; and the right to dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and
solidarity (UNGA, 1989). As Australia is a signatory to the CRC many
of the principles within the Convention are embedded within
legislation, policy and frameworks pertaining to children and young
people.

UNITED KINGDOM CHILDREN’S ACT 2004
The United Kingdom Government {UKG} Children’s Act 2004 was
specifically designed to care and support children, with many of
the principles from the Convention on the Rights of the Child
embedded within this legislation. Part 2, Section 10 refers
specifically to wellbeing and identifies six guiding principles: allow
children to be healthy; allow children to remain safe in their
environments; help children to enjoy life; assist children in their
quest to succeed; to make a positive contribution to the lives of

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

44

children; and to achieve economic stability for children’s futures
(UKG, 2004).

NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT 2001
In the United States of America {USA}, the No Child Left Behind Act
(NCLB, 2001) focusses on the premise that setting high standards
and establishing measurable goals can improve individual
outcomes in education and the quality of lives of children and
young people. While not specifying wellbeing development, the
main goal of this Act is to close the achievement gap that separates
disadvantaged children and young people and their peers. Waters
(2017) argues that while closing the gap in educational attainment
and opportunity may enhance wellbeing, much debate exists as to
whether this Act contributes to or hinders the wellbeing of children
and young people.

We suggest that you access both acts and consider the wording in each, and the
implications of enactment.

POLICY INFORMING A FOCUS ON WELLBEING
Powell and Graham (2017) note that the increasing focus on the
social and emotional wellbeing of children and young people in
Australia has attracted considerable community and political
interest, with educational contexts now taking a key role in
supporting and promoting the wellbeing of students. Waters (2017)
argues that such interest has created a rapidly changing landscape
of education governance within Australia, where responsibility
shifts between state and Commonwealth governments, which in
turn contributes to a broad and diffuse policy environment. The
rising interest wellbeing has been guided by a number of key policy
initiatives and approaches that have been put forward over the
past decade.

AUSTRALIAN POLICY
There are two key pieces of influential Australian policy: the
Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians,
and the National Mental Health Policy.

Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians
The Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young
Australians (Ministerial Council on Education, Employment,
Training and Youth Affairs {MCEETYA},2008) identified major world
issues impacting on Australian schools including high levels of
international
mobility,
ever-increasing
globalisation
and
technological change, in conjunction with increased environmental,
social and economic pressures and the ongoing acceleration of
advances in information communication technologies, which

46

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

together are placing greater demands on, and as well as providing
greater opportunities for young people.

National Mental Health Policy
The Fifth National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan
(Council of Australian Governments Health Council {COAG}, 2017)
outlines priorities to achieve the National Mental Health Policy
{NMHP}. This plan also specifically outlines an agreed set of actions
to address social and emotional wellbeing, mental illness and
suicide as a priority, as well elevate the importance of addressing
the needs of people who live with mental illness, and reducing the
stigma and discrimination that accompanies mental illness.
For further detailed information, we suggest that you access both
policies.

INTERNATIONAL POLICY
There are two main pieces of international policy that have been
influential in Australian landscape: Every Child Matters Policy
United Kingdom; and the World Health Organization Mental Health
Action Plan for 2013-2020.

Every Child Matters Policy United Kingdom
Every Child Matters policy {ECM} (Government of the United
Kingdom {GUK}, 2003) recognised 5 positive outcomes as being
essential to children and young people’s wellbeing including: being
healthy, happy and safe; developing skills for adulthood in order
to get the most out of life; to make a positive contribution in life;
being involved with the community and society and not engaging
offending or anti-social behaviour and lastly experiencing
economic wellbeing and full life potential.
It is worth noting that while there has been an increase in
international wellbeing policy, there is still no universal definition
or agreement as to what wellbeing is. Copestake’s (2008) study
of international wellbeing policy identified contrasting views of
wellbeing evident across many international policies. In many cases
policies were based on very different contrasting assumptions
about what the definition of wellbeing was, and how it could be
achieved. Similarly, Spratt (2016) argued that within Scottish
wellbeing policy “different professional discourses of wellbeing
have migrated into education policy” (p. 223), which have resulted
in differing views of wellbeing being represented.

policy for global organisations such as the World Health
Organization {WHO}. The WHO identifies mental wellbeing as a
fundamental component of good health and wellbeing. The WHO
Mental Health Action Plan for 2013-2020 (WHO, 2013) is a
comprehensive action plan that recognises the essential role of
mental health in achieving health and wellbeing for all people.

Clarke, Sixsmith and Barry (2014) note that long-term benefits, such
as improvement in social and emotional learning, increased social
emotional functioning and improved academic performance are
achieved for children and young people when wellbeing programs
are implemented effectively. The following frameworks promote
wellbeing as an intended key action.
AUSTRALIAN FRAMEWORKS
Several Australian frameworks have promoted wellbeing as an
intended outcome: National Framework for Protecting Australia’s
Children 2009-2024; National Safe Schools Framework; Australian
Student Wellbeing Framework; Learner Wellbeing Framework for
Birth to Year 12; the National Framework for Values Education
in Australian Schools 2005; the National Strategic Framework for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ Mental Health and
Social and Emotional Wellbeing.

National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children 2009-2024
The National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children
{NFPAC}2009-2020 (Council of Australian Governments {COAG},
2009) policy has a strong focus on protecting children and young
people from abuse and neglect, with wellbeing highlighted as a key
action.

50

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

The National Safe Schools Framework
The National Safe Schools Framework {NSSF} (Ministerial Council
for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs
{MCEEDYA} (2011) provides Australian educational contexts with a
set of guiding principles that assist school communities to develop
positive and practical student safety and wellbeing policies
(Australian Government Department of Education and Training
{AGDET}, 2018). The NSSF is collaborative effort by the
Commonwealth and State and Territory government and nongovernment educational context authorities and other key
stakeholders. It places an emphasis on creating a safe and
supportive educational context environment that promotes
student wellbeing and effective learning, by addressing issues of
bullying, violence, harassment, child abuse and neglect.
McCallum and Price (2016) also contended that the 2014 revision
also provides Australian educational contexts with clear vision as
well as a set of guiding principles that will enables educational
contexts to develop contextually based positive and practical
student safety and wellbeing policies, in addition to a number of
practical tools and resources that will assist in the facilitation of
positive school culture.The guiding profiles embedded within the
NSSF forefront the valuing of diversity; the positive contribution
of the whole educational community to the safety and wellbeing
of themselves and others; the need to act independently, justly,
cooperatively and responsibly in school, work, civic and family
relationships; and the provision of appropriate strategies in order
to create and maintain a safe and supportive learning environment
(MCEEDYA, 2011).

Australian Student Wellbeing Framework
The Australian framework explores the role of educators, parents

and students in promoting wellbeing and the online government
site hosts a variety of resources to assist school communities. The
vision outlined by the
Ministers of Education
Council {MEC} (2018) Australian Student Wellbeing
Framework
is for school learning communities to “promote
student wellbeing, safety and positive relationships” so that
students have the opportunity to reach their potential (MEC, 2018
p.1). In promoting student wellbeing the Australian government
has put forward a framework that consist of five interconnected
elements
essential
to
the
development,

implementation and maintenance of positive
learning environments and safety and wellbeing
policies: leadership; inclusion; student voice; partnerships; and
support provide the foundation for enhanced student wellbeing
and learning outcomes:
1. Leadership: Principals and school leaders play are an
active role in constructing positive learning environments
that are inclusive of the whole educational community,
and where all educational community members feel
included connected, safe and respected. Leadership
needs to be visible and obvious to all members of the
whole educational community.
2. Inclusion: All members of an educational context’s
community need to be included and connected to an
educational context’s culture as well as being active
participants in building a welcoming culture that values,
diversity and promotes positive, respectful relationships.
3. Student Voice: Students are key stakeholders within
educational communities and as such are active
participants in cultivating in their own learning and
wellbeing, feeling connected and using their social and
emotional skills to be respectful, resilient and safe.

52

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

4. Partnerships: Support for student learning, safety and
wellbeing requires effective school, family and community
collaboration and partnerships.
5. Support: Provision of wellbeing and support for positive
behaviour for staff within an educational context, for
students and for families by cultivating an understanding
of wellbeing through the dissemination of information on
wellbeing, cultivation a culture of wellbeing as well as
support for positive behaviour and how this supports
effective teaching and learning (Ministers of Education
Council, 2018).

Learner Wellbeing Framework for Birth to Year 12
The former South Australian Department of Education and
Children’s Services {SADECS} developed a Learner Wellbeing
Framework {LWF} 2005-2010, that targeted all children and young
people in South Australian educational sites and schools from birth
to Year 12 (SADECS, 2007). Albrecht (2014) argues that as few
learner wellbeing frameworks exist, this is a good example that
can be applied national and internationally, as the LWF promotes
wellbeing for all learners, by identifying wellbeing and learner
engagement as key directions for educators. McCallum and Price
(2016) also identified that the LWF acknowledges the
interconnection between wellbeing and learning, and proposes
that wellbeing is far more than the absence of problems. Powell
and Graham (2017) likewise noted that the LWF acknowledges the
complexity of the lives of contemporary learners and recognises
the influences of change on today’s learners.

policies
and
practices, and is aligned to the
United
Nations
General
Assembly (UNGA) Convention
of the Rights of the Child (CRC)
(1989). The LWF supports
educators to build and improve
effective wellbeing policies and
practices, and is aligned to the

Australian Department of Education

and Children’s Services (2007). Learner (1989). The LWF (Figure 3.2)
Wellbeing Framework, p.4.
identifies five dimensions of
wellbeing:
the
emotional
dimension; the social dimension; the cognitive dimension; and the
physical dimension; and the spiritual dimension, within four
domains in an educational context: learning environment;
curriculum and pedagogy; partnerships; and lastly policies
(SADECS, 2007).

In considering the above frameworks, a major research study of
wellbeing in Australian educational contexts conducted by Graham
et al. (2014), identified that within Australian education systems,
wellbeing is not clearly defined in policies, yet the term is frequently
used in policy vocabularies. Graham et al. (2014) also established
that there was little to no national nor state policy specifically
targeting the wellbeing of children and young people, and that
while many education websites signal an interest in wellbeing, very

54

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

few provided specific detail other than identification of loosely
related elements.

National Framework for Values Education in Australian Schools 2005
The National Framework for Values Education in Australian Schools
(MCEETYA, 2005) is a framework and a set of principles for values
education in twenty-first century Australian educational contexts.
The framework recognises that there is a significant history of
values education in Australian government and non-government
educational contexts, which draw on a range of philosophies,
beliefs and traditions. It also acknowledges that values education
contributes to wellbeing development of children and young
people. The framework identifies “guiding principles to support
educational contexts in implementing values education; key
elements and approaches to implementing values education; and a
set of values for Australian schooling” (MCEETYA, 2005, p.1).
In responding to concerns around wellbeing, many educators
have explored values-based frameworks. A case study by White
and Waters (2015) identified that the use of a strengths-based
approach framework contributed to the development of greater
virtue, self-efficacy, and wellbeing in both children and young
people.

National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Peoples’ Mental Health and Social and Emotional Wellbeing
The National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Peoples’ Mental Health and Social and Emotional
Wellbeing 2017-2023 (Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council
{AHMAC}, (2017) provides a dedicated focus on Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander children, young people and adult’s social and

POLICY, FRAMEWORKS AND LEGISLATION INFORMING A FOCUS

emotional wellbeing and mental health. This framework endeavors
to identify a culturally appropriate framework that guides and
supports Indigenous mental health and wellbeing policy and
practice.
There is an emerging global recognition of the significance
Indigenous peoples’ wellbeing and the inadequacies of
conventional socio-economic and demographic data that is used
measure relative wellbeing. However, Prout (2012) argued that
statistical data used to report on the wellbeing status of Indigenous
populations is based on a preconceived set of assumptions
grounded in the non-indigenous concepts of wellbeing,
demography, and economic productivity and prosperity. Prout
(2012) also argues that such assumptions directly impact on how
Indigenous peoples are represented across broader society and to
governments.
Key Question

•

How does the Indigenous wellbeing framework differ from previously discussed
wellbeing frameworks?

Australian jurisdictional frameworks
Several Australian jurisdictions have been specifically developed
wellbeing frameworks to promote and develop student and staff
wellbeing in educational contexts and these include: Queensland
Student Learning and Wellbeing Framework; New South Wales
Wellbeing Framework for Schools; South Australian Wellbeing for
Learning and Life Framework; and the Northern Territory
Government Principal Wellbeing Framework.

56

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

Queensland Student Learning and Wellbeing Framework
The Queensland Department of Education, {QDE} (2018) Student
Learning and Wellbeing Framework focusses on developing
healthy, confident and resilient young people who can successfully
navigate a more complex world. This framework combines a focus
on learning and wellbeing. Key actions identified by the framework
include: the creation of safe, supportive and inclusive
environments; the building of staff, students and the school
community capability; the implementation of supportive and
inclusive environments; and the development of strong systems for
early intervention(QDET, 2018).

New South Wales Wellbeing Framework for Schools
The New South Wales Department of Education and Communities
{NSWDEC} (2015) Wellbeing Framework for Schools drives
wellbeing development in educational contexts, by encouraging
teaching and learning environments to focus on enabling the
development of healthy, happy, successful and productive
individuals. Within this framework students are also expected to
contribute to their own wellbeing, the wellbeing of their peers and
the collective wellbeing of their communities (NSW DEC, 2015).

South Australian Wellbeing for Learning and Life Framework
The South Australian Department of Education and Child
Development {SADECD} (2016) Wellbeing for Learning and Life: A
framework for building resilience and wellbeing in children and
young people, applies across all areas of South Australian children

POLICY, FRAMEWORKS AND LEGISLATION INFORMING A FOCUS

ON WELLBEING

and young people’s lives. This framework recognises the significant
impact of education and care settings, and has links to the ACARA
and the Early Years Learning Framework.

Northern Territory Government Principal Wellbeing Framework
The Northern Territory Government {NTG} (2017) Principal
Wellbeing Framework specifically targets the wellbeing of school
principals. This framework supports principal wellbeing by
“empowering principals to build their own wellbeing capacity
through increased knowledge, skills, resilience and resources”
(NTG, p.3).

OTHER INFLUENCES
In Australia there have been several other influences on wellbeing
and these include: Australian Professional Standards for Teachers,
Australian Professional Standards for Principals; and the Australian
Curriculum.

AUSTRALIAN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS
The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers {APST}
(Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership {AITSL},
2011) outlines a public statement of what constitutes teacher

POLICY, FRAMEWORKS AND LEGISLATION INFORMING A FOCUS

ON WELLBEING

quality. Professional Standard 4, Create and Maintain Supportive
and Safe Learning Environments provide a framework for fostering
wellbeing and a mentally healthy educational community.

AUSTRALIAN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR PRINCIPALS
The Australian Professional Standards for Principals {APSP} (AITSL,
2014) provides a public statement setting out what school
principals are expected to know, understand and do in order to
succeed in school leadership. The accompanying Leadership
Profiles arise directly from the Standards, and are presented as
a set of leadership actions that effective principals implement in
order to develop and support teaching that maximizes student
learning.

AUSTRALIAN CURRICULUM
Powell and Graham (2017) note that governments across the globe
are now using National Curriculum Frameworks as a means to
implement student wellbeing. Waters (2017) also identified that
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s
{OECD} (2015) Centre for Educational Research and Innovation’s
{CERI} analysis of National Curriculum Frameworks across 37 OECD
countries identified that student wellbeing was an explicit aim for
72% of countries, with many OECD countries are now aiming to
systematically foster both academic outcomes and student
wellbeing outcomes.
The Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority
{ACARA}, 2016) sets out consistent national standards to improve
learning outcomes for all young Australians. The General
Capabilities of the Australian Curriculum specifically outline the
need for students to develop social and emotional skills, and

60

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

acknowledges the link between academic outcomes and mental
health (ACARA, 2016). Developing personal and social competence
and managing self, relationships, lives, work and learning more
effectively; recognizing and regulating emotions and developing
concern for, and understanding of others; establishing positive
relationships; making responsible decisions; working effectively in
teams; and handling challenging situations constructively are
identified and key capabilities (ACARA, 2016). For further
information we suggested accessing these frameworks in full.
Interestingly, the construct of wellbeing is not always viewed
the same way in international educational judications. A study by
Souter, O’Steen and Gilmore (2012) suggested that New Zealand
educational system’s view of wellbeing differs from how it is
conceptualized within literature, with words and phrases
describing wellbeing constructs more often associated with the
Relating domain rather than the Feeling domain. Thorburn’s (2017)
examination of wellbeing in curriculum in Scotland identified a
policy vision of a more progressive, integrated and holistic form of
education; a commitment which contains an obligation for health
and wellbeing to be a responsibility of all teachers, however, there
were often issues with enactment of the policy due to problems
communicating policy expectations.
In contrast, O’Toole (2017) outlines wellbeing as being
conceptualised in Ireland in terms of child and youth mental health,
and how that this informs a focus on school-based prevention and
intervention approaches. And finally, Fattore, Mason and Watson
(2012) propose a different perspective on wellbeing by exploring
the use of student voice as mechanism for developing wellbeing in
New Zealand’s curriculum frameworks.

Consider elements of the APST, APSP and ACARA frameworks that could be in

CONCLUSION
Chapter 3 has explored Australian and international legislation,
policy, and frameworks which inform a focus on wellbeing.
Investigation reveals that local, state, national and international
jurisdictions all agree that children and young people have the right
to an education that supports their wellbeing and development.
Improving the wellbeing of Australian children and young people
has also been a key priority for Australian governments. However,
despite this there is no universal definition or agreement as to what
wellbeing is and how it could be achieved, with many contrasting
constructs of wellbeing evident across local, state and national
Australian policies. The implementation of wellbeing policy,
frameworks and legislation is then complex and open to multiple
interpretations which make enactment problematic for educational
contexts.

INTRODUCTION
It is now widely accepted that wellbeing has moved to centre stage
in recent years, with educational contexts now playing a vital role
in prioritising the promotion of wellbeing of children and young
people (MCEETYA, 2008). There is also growing international and
national evidence that educational context-based wellbeing
programs, when implemented effectively, produce long term

benefits for children and young people, including improved social
emotional functioning and academic performance (Clarke, Sixsmith
& Barry, 2014). Additionally, McCallum and Price, (2016) argue that
educational contexts also play a vital role in fostering teacher
wellbeing. In order to understand the construct of wellbeing more,
this chapter will explore contemporary perspectives on factors that
impact on, and enable wellbeing, which have been termed
impactors and enablers to wellbeing (Carter, 2016).

PERSPECTIVES ON WELLBEING IMPACTORS
AND ENABLERS
There are differing perspectives on impactors and enablers of
wellbeing. One study conducted in Queensland Australia by Carter
(2016), acknowledged that impactors of Subjective Well-Being
{SWB}were broadly what a participant reported as impacting upon
their SWB. More specifically a negative impactor {referred to simply
as impactor} was defined as that which detracts from a person’s
SWB as a consequence of a negative evaluation. A positive impactor
{referred to simply as an enabler} was defined as that which
enhanced a person’s SWB as a consequence of a positive
evaluation. Enablers were linked to a way of working intended
to support the person to make a positive evaluation of their
competency and therefore feel satisfied with life or feel positive
affect.
Carter (2016) identified several major negative impactors to
school principal’s SWB, such as a perceived lack of time to complete
expected tasks; perceived lack of support; perceived lack of
supervisor trust; self-doubting; inability to safe guard others; and
questionable/poor decision making. Time was referred to with
breadth as being time to learn; time to experience; insufficient time
to think; and a preoccupation of thinking about work when in non-

70

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

work related contexts. This impactor may well apply to teachers
and students who report experiencing high levels of stress when
faced with tasks they feel unable to complete competently within
specified timeframes due to what Mulford (2003) terms as the
busyness of educational contexts. A noted enabler was a feeling of
control to create and maintain life balance and that this sense of
balance {determined differently by each individual} helped them to
maintain their positive SWB (Carter, 2016).
McCallum and Price (2016) suggest that wellbeing is more
influenced by factors that impact on, and / or enable an individual
to respond effectively in times of crisis, trauma, or ill-health.
Approaches subscribing to this view tend to focus on resilience
as a key impactor, and resilience development as a key enabler
of wellbeing. While this perspective certainly has merit, there has
been a growing movement, particularly in regard to the notion of
wellbeing within educational contexts, that views wellbeing being
as “more than just the absence of illness, and includes life
satisfaction, healthy behaviours and resilience” (Ryff, 1989, as cited
in McCallum & Price, 2012, p.4).
McCallum and Price (2016) suggest that there needs to be a
positive and proactive approach to promoting wellbeing in
educational settings, as it promotes wellbeing as a central focus
and recognises the influences of change and the complexity in the
21st century, rather than being reactive and deficit in thinking.
McCallum and Price (2016) likewise argue that this perspective also
promotes a much more ‘holist’ view of wellbeing within a whole
educational context. Additionally, Scoffham and Barnes (2011)
argue that this approach also acknowledges the influence and
interrelatedness between context, environment, life events,
genetics and personality impactors and enablers on wellbeing such
as:
• Context and physical environments: e.g., contextual
processes and demographics, location, community and

CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACTORS AND
ENABLERS TO WELLBEING

71

specific events such as drought, floods and cyclones;
• Social and cultural environments: e.g., culture,
economics, politics and broader social issues such as
poverty, community breakdown or violence;
• Individual personal attributes: e.g., genetics (heritage),
psychological disposition and behavioural patterns
(Litchfield, Cooper, Hancock & Watt, 2016).
Another perspective presented by Gillet-Swan and Sargeant (2015)
is that the key components of wellbeing symbolise an intersection
forming a triumvirate of the emotional, physical and cognitive self.
As such, wellbeing ought be seen as the state of an individual as
affected by these elements, within which, an array of descriptors
exist.

IDENTIFYING IMPACTORS AND ENABLERS
Understanding the dynamic interplay and interrelatedness
between factors that negatively impact wellbeing and factors that
help support positive wellbeing can provide an insight into how
they influence wellbeing (Gillett-Swan & Sargeant, 2015). Three
broad themes have emerged from the literature: genetic factors;
life circumstances; and involvement in active pursuits.
1. Genetic factors
Genetic factors such as an individual’s predisposition towards
being happy or not, have the potential to either enable or impact
on wellbeing. Although there are interactions between genetics,
upbringing and environment, Diener and Oishi (2005) note that,
genetic makeup acts as a strong precursor to wellbeing, where
the temperament of the person has potential to act as a strong

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

72

antecedent influence to wellbeing in either a positive or negative
manner. Likewise, Burack, Blidner, Flores and Finch (2007) also
argue that genetic factors account for “fifty percent of an
individual’s predisposition to happiness” (Burack et al., 2007, p.3).
2. Life circumstances
Life circumstances and the impacts that life has had on an
individual either enable or impact on wellbeing. Campion and
Nurse (2007) note that life circumstances, such socio economic
status, income, material possessions, marital status and
community environment have potential to significantly impact and
/ or enable wellbeing. In contrast Burack et al. (2007) argue while
life circumstances do impact on wellbeing, they can change very
rapidly {either for the better or the worst}, and as such argue
that they only account for “10 % of personal happiness variation
even though society spends a disproportionate amount on them”
(Campion & Nurse, 2007, p.27).
3. Involvement in active pursuits and special interests
Intentional involvement in active pursuits and special interests
such as engaging in meaningful activities, participating in the
workforce, socialising, physical activity and exercising and
appreciating art, culture and life, can account for up to 40% of
variation in happiness (Campion & Nurse, 2007), and as such have
the greatest potential for influencing and enabling wellbeing. As a
consequence, an individual’s chance of maintaining good wellbeing
is increased by an active engagement in life. Conversely, nonparticipation has great potential to be a significant impactor on
wellbeing.

Let’s now examine impactors and enablers
through two models that place wellbeing as the
central focus, the Dynamic Model for Wellbeing

CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACTORS AND
ENABLERS TO WELLBEING

73

(Campion & Nurse, 2007), and the Positive Social
Ecology Model (McCallum & Price, 2012).
DYNAMIC MODEL FOR WELLBEING
Campion and Nurse’s (2007) Dynamic Model for Wellbeing (refer
to Figure 4.2) investigates the interaction between mental health
and public health. The manner in which they outline wellbeing is
similar to how other theorists have defined it with elements such
as belonging, resilience, positive emotions meaning and fulfilment.
This model has potential use and application in educational
contexts as it illustrates the dynamic interplay between individual,
physical and societal influences on wellbeing, through what are
termed risk factors and protective factors. Campion and

Nurse suggest:
• Reducing the impact factors on individual, and the
individual in groups, whole context and within systems.
• Improving social and physical wellbeing.
• Creating supportive environments
• Improving protective factors such as employing
therapists, accessing supports and empowering
individuals.
This model places wellbeing at the centre of improving physical
and social wellbeing, and recognises risk factors {impactors}, and
protective factors {enablers} of wellbeing. While this model has
broader application in terms of policy development, it does have
application to an educational context, as it identifies three main
impactors and enablers affecting an individual’s wellbeing: genetic
factors; life circumstances; and involvement in active pursuits and
special interests.

POSITIVE SOCIAL ECOLOGY MODEL
McCallum and Price (2012)’s positive social ecology model draws
on Bronfenbrenner’s (2004) work, and describes wellbeing within
the natural, information, social and cultural environments of a
community. This model identifies the following impacting and
enabling factors:
• Intrapersonal factors: Interpersonal factors encompass
the demographics of a group or community; the interrelationships between people residing in that community;
and the biological and psychological factors of the people
within that community.
• Environmental factors: Environmental factors comprise
the real or perceived views or experiences on crime,
safety, physical attractiveness, comfort, convenience and
accessibility and how they may impact on the immediate
environment.
• Behavioural factors: Behavioural factors include the

CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACTORS AND

75

range of activities, services or access to programs,
applications or structures available to people living and
working in a community that enable them to be positively
engaged as well as being intellectually, emotionally and
physically active.
• Political factors: Political factors incorporate the policies,
practices, infrastructure and communication that impact
on people living and working within the community.

IMPACTORS TO WELLBEING
McCallum and Price (2016) note that a range of factors that impact
wellbeing on a daily, weekly or monthly basis {some of which are
within one’s control and some which are not}, with some adversely
affecting wellbeing. Impactors may also occur suddenly or
accumulate over lengthy periods of time before physical and/or
mental indicators become evident. Significant impactors include
the following:
• Personal responses to individual, physical, social or

76

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

environmental impactors
Stress, fear, anxiety in response to stimuli such as peer conflict,
relational conflict, harassment bullying, pressure from systemic
requirements and time constraints, accountabilities, expectations
and absence of a voice in decision making processes, can
contribute to fatigue, exhaustion, stress, burnout, illness, and
mental health issues which in turn may lead to poor overall
wellbeing (Acton & Glasgow, 2015).
• Unsuccessful adaptions to individual, physical, social
or environmental impactors
Low levels of resilience, optimism, self-esteem, and feelings of
having no control over one’s life, impact on an individual’s ability to
respond effectively in times of crisis, trauma, or ill-health, and as
such have major impacts on wellbeing.
• Negative self-efficacy
Negative self-efficacy, self-judgment and self-belief impact on an
individual’s view of their own self and their capabilities, which may
lead to the development of negative self-view and poor wellbeing
(Acton & Glasgow, 2015).
• Negative or destructive relationships
Negative relationships between adults and adults, children and
adults, and children and children arising from conflict, lack of
emotional support, poor supportive environment, bullying,
discrimination and harassment (Powell & Graham, 2017) impact
greatly on wellbeing.
• A lack of social-emotional competence/emotional
intelligence
A lack of social and emotional competence or disposition impacts

CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACTORS AND
ENABLERS TO WELLBEING

77

on wellbeing by cultivating negative or destructive relationships,
which in turn contribute to a negative work, school or classroom
climate, and subsequent loss of productivity (Abeles & Rubenstein,
2015).

ENABLERS TO WELLBEING
McCallum and Price (2016) identify three key enablers of a positive
school ecology as hope, happiness and belonging that help enable
wellbeing.
1. Hope: Being optimistic about the future, pursing
aspirations and taking control of one’s own wellbeing
{being agentic} are key features in contemporary
wellbeing education initiatives (Wrench, Hammond,
McCallum & Price, 2013). The construct of ‘hope’ is
comprised of two dimensions:
•

The mental willpower to move towards achieving one’s
goal {agency};

• The perceived ability to create pathways that enable the
achievement of goals (McCallum & Price, 2016)
2. Happiness: Positive emotional state.
3. Belonging: Human beings have a fundamental need to
belong and be accepted.

ENABLERS TO WELLBEING IN EDUCATIONAL
CONTEXTS
Noble, McGrath, Wyatt, Carbines and Robb (2008) in a report to the
Australian Department of Education, Employment and Workplace
Relations {DEEWR} identified the following seven enablers to
wellbeing in educational contexts: (refer to Figure 4. 3):
1. A supportive, caring and inclusive community
•

Individuals feel welcomed, valued, respected and free
form discrimination and harassment (Cahill & Freeman,
2007);

• Connectedness and opportunities to develop deep
personal connections between individuals and groups
(Acton & Glasgow, 2015);
•

A sense of belonging;

• Feeling safe;
• Treated fairly;
• Positive peer and adult relationships where positive
relationships have an affirmative influence on wellbeing,
which in turn contributes to satisfaction, productivity and
achievement (McCallum, Price, Graham & Morrison,
2017).

CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACTORS AND
ENABLERS TO WELLBEING

79

2. Pro-social values
• The promotion of pro-social values including core values
such were respect, trust, kindness, understanding,
acceptance, honesty, compassion, acceptance of
difference, fairness, responsibility care and inclusion
(Noble et al., 2008).
• The presence of daily rituals that embed core values such
as greetings, and visual images (McCallum & Price, 2016).
3. Physical & emotional safety
• The presence of anti-bullying, anti-harassment and antiviolence strategies, policies, procedures and programs
(Noble et al., 2008).
4. Social & emotional competencies
• The presence of social and emotional coping skills, selfawareness, emotional regulation skills, empathy, goal
achievement skills, relationship skills promote positive
wellbeing (Noble et al., 2008). Social and emotional
knowledge and dispositions are essential in order to
operate and contribute productively (Mc McCallum &
Price, 2016) in work, educational settings and the broader
societal context.
• Effective emotional intelligence competencies enable
wellbeing by facilitating the identification, processing, and
regulation of emotion as well assisting in managing stress
more effectively (McCallum, Price, Graham & Morrison,
2017).
• Resilience is essential to successfully adapt to and
respond to complex or threatening life experiences and
fast paced, challenging contemporary societal conditions.

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

80

(McCallum, Price, Graham & Morrison, 2017).
• Positive self-efficacy is essential to producing positive
productive performance. It also determines how an
individual thinks, feels, and motivates themselves,
thereby increasing potential for a positive state of
wellbeing (Split, Koomen & Thijs, 2011).
5. A strengths-based approach
• Having a focus on identifying and developing individual
intellectual and character strengths promotes a positive
state of wellbeing (Noble et al., 2008).
6. A sense of meaning and purpose
• An intentional involvement in active pursuits and special
interests such as “socialising and participating in {one or
more} spirituality activities; community service;
appreciating life, art/culture; and engaging in meaningful
activities” (Campion & Nurse, 2007, p.25) are active
enablers of wellbeing.
7. Healthy lifestyle
• Engaging in exercise, having good nutrition and avoiding
avoidance of harmful substances promote a state of
positive wellbeing (McCallum, Price, Graham & Morrison,
2017).

Key Question

•

If you used this model or aspects of it, what are the possible impactors or enablers
to wellbeing in your context?

INCLUSION AND WELLBEING
The models above all link in some way to a feeling of being

82

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

included, with most linking to inclusion in educational contexts. As
our world changes with increases in migration, refugee numbers
and social complexity, our educational contexts also change and
reflect what is happening within society (Abawi, Andersen & Rogers,
2019). What does this mean then for our educational contexts
who are trying to engage in teaching and learning as their core
business, in addition to being inclusive of a changing population?
Educational contexts often have families from many different
countries and varying socio-economic backgrounds, all with
differing experiences, beliefs, values, thinking and opinions. As a
consequence, promoting and sustaining wellbeing within such
contexts can at times be a very complex (yet essential) task.
Educational communities need to be encouraged to embrace a
shared philosophy of inclusion, and to participate in practices that
are welcoming and supportive, encourage equity and view changes
in student population and diversity as opportunities for learning
(Carter & Abawi, 2018).
Carter and Abawi (2018, p. 2) suggest that “inclusion is defined as
successfully meeting student learning needs regardless of culture,
language, cognition, gender, gifts and talents, ability, or
background.” A feeling of being included and belonging is
associated with positive wellbeing, and creating an environment
for this to occur involves catering for the needs of individuals.
While the literature reveals that the term ‘special needs’ has been
linked to both disability and disadvantage, Carter and Abawi (2018)
suggest the term now be applied more broadly to include “the
individual requirements of a person, and the provision for these
specific differences can be considered as catering for special
needs” (p. 2) and these needs include supporting wellbeing.

CONCLUSION
There are multiple ways of working within wider society, an
organisation, and an educational context that can impact on and
/or enable positive wellbeing. If particular ways of working are
known to impact wellbeing, then it is suggested that the impact
or implications be mitigated in order to achieve a more positive
outcome. Likewise, if ways of working are known to enable
wellbeing. then the impact or implications could be changed in
order to achieve a more positive outcome. The Dynamic Model
of Wellbeing (Campion & Nurse, 2007), the Positive Social Ecology
Model (McCallum & Price, 2016) and the Revised Student Wellbeing
Pathways (Noble et al., 2008) are suggested as possible models
that could be utilised to investigate and analyse enablers and
impactors within organisations and educational contexts.

INTRODUCTION
Given that almost all children attend school or an educational
setting (e.g., early childhood centre) at some time during their
lives, school and educational setting communities now have an

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

89

unprecedented opportunity to play a role in supporting wellbeing
development in conjunction with academic development. A wholeschool or educational setting approach to student wellbeing
promotion calls for student wellbeing approaches that are
embedded in an education wide focus in policies, curriculum,
structures and practices, and as a shared responsibility of all
stakeholders (McCallum & Price, 2016). How do we best do this and
take into account the diversity of our school or educational setting
communities, while supporting and including people? In order to
further a positive and proactive approach to promoting wellbeing
in educational settings, this Chapter will explore pragmatic
applications of embedding an education wide focus on wellbeing.

Key Question

Before exploring approaches to wellbeing, take a moment to consider your own context.
•

How is wellbeing represented within the context’s policies, structures, practices,
curriculum and pedagogy?

APPROACHES TO WELLBEING
The wellbeing of children and young people remains a concern
both nationally and internationally, with an increasing focus of
wellbeing policy, programs, and teacher professional development
(Anderson & Graham,2016). Supporting wellbeing is now central
to the business of educational contexts. However, as Barry, Clarke
and Dowling (2017) note, the challenge for educational contexts
and education system leaders lies in integrating evidence-based

90

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

approaches that promote children and young people’s social and
emotional wellbeing and staff wellbeing, and that are sustainable
and embedded into the everyday practice of educational contexts.
Approaches to wellbeing can be categorised as: positive psychology
approaches; health and physical approaches; social and emotional
learning approaches; character development and values
approaches; relational approaches; and an inclusive approaches as
shown in the Growing Inclusive Wellbeing model.

POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY APPROACHES
There has been a rapid growth in positive psychology approaches
within educational communities, resulting in a number of
associated practices now making their way into educational
classrooms and settings all over the world (Ciarrochi, Atkins, Hayes,
Sahdra & Parker, 2016). Positive psychology approaches focus on
promoting optimal functioning and wellbeing by utilising
“psychological discourse and its offshoot school-based training
programs, which stress happiness, self-improvement and
wellbeing” (Reveley, 2016, p.538). Positive discourse approaches
promote a conscious reflexive subjectivity; a focus on self and selfregulation; the use of creative ‘psychological flexibility’; and
‘mindfulness’; as a means to wellbeing (Revelely, 2016; Kashdan,
2010). Burckhardt, Manicavasagar, Batterham, and Hadzi-Pavlovic
(2016) proport a viewpoint that such positive psychological
approaches to wellbeing are more productive, in that emphasis is
placed on prevention and early intervention, rather than reactive
intervention in response to “maladaptive emotion regulation
strategies that correlate with poor wellbeing” {e.g., depression,
anxiety} (p.41). Emerging from these approaches are a wide range
of strategies that can be used within school communities to reduce
distress, manage stress, improve mental health and wellbeing.

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

91

• Programs developing skills in assertiveness, decision
making, coping, relaxation, confidence, organisation and
persistence, in addition to cognitive reframing (Waters,
2011).
• Mindfulness training with a focus on intention
{understand personal purpose}, attention {to focus and
pay attention, to be non-judgmental, to focus on the
present and be receptive to one’s mind and body’s
reactions, feelings, sensations and thought} and attitude
(McCallum & Price, 2016).
• Explicit resilience training (McGrath & Noble, 2012).
• Individual wellbeing strategies such as:
◦ Reflection strategies for insight into personal
practice and / or behaviour.
◦ Building supportive networks or learning
communities.
◦ Growth mindset approaches to solving problems.
◦ Self-care practices to restore wellbeing when
needed.
◦ Celebrating achievements and success
(McCallum, Price, Graham & Morrison, 2017).
According to Hayes and Ciarrochi (2015), effective
implementation of educational context wide positive psychology
approaches that promote wellbeing are underpinned require five
key actions including:
1. The establishment of contexts that empower individuals
to clarify their values and choose value-consistent
behaviours.

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

92

2. Assisting individuals to utilise language to successfully
and appropriately engage in varying contexts.
3. Supporting individuals to acquire

4.

resources and
skills via exploration and apply these to
varying contexts.
Assisting individuals to gain awareness of their inner
and outer experiences and to appreciate their current
context and choices.

5. Helping individuals to develop understand the ‘self’
and the perspectives of others.
However, it is worth noting that while research shows that
positive psychology approaches (Ciarrochi, Parker, Kashdan,
Heaven, & Barkus, 2015; Garland, Fredrickson, Kring, Johnson,
Meyer & Penn, 2010) and school community positive education
interventions have been shown to produce positive benefit
(Waters, 2011), positive psychology has been criticized for being
“decontextualized and coercive, and for putting an excessive
emphasis on positive states, whilst failing to adequately consider
negative experiences” (Ciarrochi et al., 2016, p.1).

HEALTH AND PHYSICAL APPROACHES
Good health in addition to regular participation in physical activity
has been well recognised as having a positive impact on many
aspects of children and young people’s health (Janssen and
LeBlanc, 2010). Furthermore, Liu, Wu and Ming (2015) found that
the educational contexts are some of the most effective settings in
which to improve health and wellbeing outcomes and is consistent
with the view that educational communities can create
opportunities for stimulating and supporting all children and young

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION

people to be more physically active (Holt, Smedegaard, Pawlowski,
Skovgaard & Christiansen, 2018; Naylor & McKay, 2009).
The following approaches have been widely utilised to address
the health and physical education dimensions of wellbeing, in
addition to the basic needs of children and young people (Naylor &
McKay, 2009).
• Breakfast Clubs.
• After educational context / school care programs.
• Programs that provide assistance with shelter, clothing
and care.
• Strategies to improve child protection and safety.
• Programs focussing on physical fitness, active lifestyles,
healthy eating and self-esteem development.
• Programs focusing on safe and responsible choices and
avoidance of harmful situations and substances.
• Strategies and programs to protect against bullying and
being safe on line.
Carlsson, Rowe and Stewart (2001) identified that wellbeing was
promoted in educational contexts when three key actions were in
place.
1. Curriculum, teaching and learning that encompassed a
holistic view of health and the development of more
generic life skills such as decision making, effective
communication and negotiation skills (Carlsson et
al.,2001).
2. Whole of educational context ethos, environment,
structures, organisation, policies and planning that
support and reinforce health messages that are taught in

94

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

the formal curriculum (Carlsson et al.,2001).
3. Commitment and collaboration within an educational
context’s community to develop a shared vision and
create strategies to address the physical and health
needs of the whole educational context (Carlsson et al.,
2001; McCallum & Price, 2016).

SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING APPROACHES
Greensburg, Domitrovich, Weissberg and Durlack (2017) argue that
evidence-based Social and Emotional Learning {SEL} programs,
when implemented effectively have potential to promote
measurable and long-lasting improvements in the lives of children
and young people. SEL approaches have a focus on contributing to
wellbeing by developing responsibility, social skills and emotional
management strategies which enhance children and young
people’s “confidence in themselves; increase their engagement in
school, along with their test scores and grades; and reduce conduct
problems while promoting desirable behaviours” (Greensburg et al.
2017. p.13).
SEL program promote wellbeing by teaching students specific
SEL skills in order to create a classroom and educational context
culture that enhances and enables SEL skills (refer to Figure 5.2).

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION

Figure 5.2 Andersen, C, Adapted Conceptual Model for Advancing SEL in
Schools from Greensburg, M.T., Domitrovich, C.E., Weissberg, R.R. & Durlack,

education. Future of Children, 27 (1),13-32, p.17. Used under a Creative

There are five core elements of the model: self-awareness, selfmanagement, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible
decision making.
• Competence in self-awareness which involves
understanding your own emotions, values, and personal
goals {knowing own strengths and limitations, a sense of
self- efficacy; optimism; a growth mindset; ability to
recognise how own thoughts, feelings, and actions are
connected} (Greensburg et al. 2017).
• Competence in self-management which encompasses

96

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

regulation of own emotions and behaviours; the ability to
delay gratification; manage stress; control impulses; and
persevere through challenges.
• Competence in social awareness describes the ability to
take the perspective of people with different backgrounds
or from different cultures; empathize; act with
compassion toward others; understand social behaviour
norms} (Greensburg et al., 2017).
• Relationship skills involves the establishment and
maintenance of healthy and rewarding relationships and
includes the ability to act in accordance with social norms
{communicating clearly, listening actively, cooperating,
resisting inappropriate social pressure, negotiating
conflict constructively, and seeking help when needed}
(Greensburg et al., 2017).
• Responsible decision-making is outlined as utilising the
knowledge, skills, and attitudes to make constructive
choices.

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND VALUES APPROACHES
The last decade has seen a growth in interest in use of character
development and values approaches within educational contexts
as mechanisms for promoting wellbeing (Smith, 2013). Character
development and values approaches foster important core, ethical
and performance values such as caring, honesty, diligence,
fairness, fortitude, responsibility, and respect for self and others
as a means of affecting wellbeing (Quinlan, Swain & Vella-Brodrick,
2012). Both styles of approach support wellbeing through a focus
on character strength training processes; by understanding and
reflecting on values; and reflecting values in one’s own attitudes

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

97

and behaviour. However, Linkins, Niemiec, Gillham and Mayerson
(2015) argue that this approach tends to be more prescriptive in
nature than other previously discussed approaches, and views
character and values as an” external construct that needs to be
instilled within the individual {rather than an innate potential to be
nurtured}” (p.64).

RELATIONAL APPROACHES
According to Correa-Velez, Gifford and Barnett (2010), relational
approaches provide opportunities for children and young people
to feel connected; to feel that they belong; and to feel that they
are cared for. The ability of children and young people to connect
has been shown to be a key protective factor in lowering health
risk behaviour while concurrently increasing positive wellbeing
(McCallum & Price, 2016). Relational approaches to supporting
wellbeing focus on supporting wellbeing through programs and
initiatives that focus on:
• Relationships that are positive and productive
engagements between children/young people teachers
and peers.
• Belonging where a sense of membership of the
educational context is experienced.
• Inclusion where a sense of being included in the
educational context’s school culture, structure and
processes.
• Active participation which describes the extent to which
children and young people feel that they participate in,
and exercise voice in relations to a educational context’s
activities ad affairs (Aldridge, Fraser, Fozdar, Ala’I, Earnest
& Afari, 2016). Interestingly, Fattore, Mason and Watson

98

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

(2012) report that students who were provided with an
opportunity to have their say and have their opinions
taken seriously, demonstrated higher levels of wellbeing
than student without an opportunity to have their say.

APPROACHING WELLBEING FOR ABORIGINAL AND
TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PEOPLES
As authors working at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) we
acknowledge the Giabal and Jarowair peoples of the Toowoomba area,
the Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul peoples of Ipswich and Springfield,
the Kambuwal peoples of Stanthorpe and the Gadigal peoples of the
Eora nation, Sydney as the keepers of ancient knowledge where USQ
campuses and hubs have been built and whose cultures and customs
continue to nurture this land. USQ also pays respect to Elders – past,
present and future. Further, we acknowledge the cultural diversity of
all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and pay respect to
Elders past, present and future. Finally, we celebrate the continuous
living cultures of First Australians and acknowledge the important
contributions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have and
continue to make in Australian society.
Please take a moment to listen to why we need to acknowledge
its traditional custodians.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience
considerably more widespread social disadvantages and poor
health (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018) than any other
Indigenous population in the developed world, and alarmingly
these outcomes are similar to Third World countries (Kingsley, J.,
Townsend, M., Henderson-Wilson, C., & Bolam, 2013; Carrington,
Sheperd, Jianghong & Zubrick, 2012). Kingsley et al. (2018), suggest

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

99

that evidence indicates that such inequalities can be better
understood by focusing on a range of factors including the impact
of colonisation, intergenerational trauma, cultural and social
determinants of health, and by considering holistic ideas of
wellbeing. Kingsley et al. (2018) also argue that current notions of
indigenous wellbeing should be challenged. It is imperative that
wellbeing outcomes are improved and schools can play a role in
help enact change, guided by the National Strategic Framework
for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ Mental Health
and Social and Emotional Wellbeing 2017-2023 (Australian Health
Ministers’ Advisory Council {AHMAC}, (2017).
Addressing wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples requires understanding contexts (see Fossey, Holborn,
Abawi, & Cooper, {2017} Understanding Australian Aboriginal
Educational Contexts); Understanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Perspectives recognising human rights and the strength
of family and kinship groups, traditional lifestyles, language, and
geographical places. As authors we recognise and support the
points raised by Alderete (2004) that the notion of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander peoples wellbeing should not only be linked
to a set of standards or measurable indicators that are easy to
implement for government reporting purposes and requirements.
Instead wellbeing indicators should also include nuances that
capture the numerous positive, protective enduring elements,
connected with Aboriginal and Torres Strait peoples’ ways of life
(Prout, 2012). Biddle and Swee (2012), identified that there are
many instances and examples in literature on Indigenous peoples
that highlight the positive relationship between the sustainability of
Indigenous land, culture and language and an Indigenous person’s
wellbeing.
There are things you can be mindful of to make your support
more meaningful for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples
who may be struggling with their wellbeing. Panelli and Tipa (2009)

suggest providing a culturally safe environment embedded with
positive social relationships, being respectful of culture with
connection to Country, kinship, traditional knowledge, and identity,
and being supportive of physical, social, and spiritual needs helps
foster wellbeing. We also encourage you to involve family, carers,
or other community members in providing positive support.

Key Questions

Considering the points raised by Panelli and Tipa (2009) that providing a culturally safe
environment embedded with positive social relationships, being respectful of culture with
connection to Country, kinship, traditional knowledge, and identity, and being supportive
of physical, social, and spiritual needs helps foster wellbeing.

AN INCLUSIVE APPROACH
An inclusive approach synthesises elements of positive psychology,
health and physical; social and emotional learning, character
development and values, and relational approaches into one
approach as educational contexts are expected to addresses all of
these components we thought the approach to wellbeing needed
to also be responsive to the contemporary educational context
content. We present a model to depict the approach as shown
below in Figure 5.3 Growing Inclusive Wellbeing.

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

101

Figure 5.3 Growing inclusive wellbeing

The model ‘Growing Inclusive Wellbeing’ depicts five components,

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

102

represented visually as circles in order to highlight the layers of
knowledge, understanding and enactment through pathways that
are embedded: the inner circle; an individual level; community
level; structural level; and the educational context environmental
culture.

The inner circle
The inner circle, Deep Understanding of Wellbeing, represents the
development of a whole educational context community
understanding of wellbeing, including the enablers and impactors
that are present within the content. As authors we suggest that
every individual experiences wellbeing differently and as such
embrace the definition put forward by Diener, Oishi, and Lucas
(2003) to be “people’s emotional and cognitive evaluations of their
lives, includes what lay people call happiness, peace, fulfilment,
and life satisfaction” (p. 403). People’s views and definitions of SWB
(commonly referred to as wellbeing) are personal and dependent
upon how each individual evaluates their life (Carter 2016).

The three levels of wellbeing support
The next three circles in the diagram, depict factors that have an
influence on wellbeing across all populations and these can be
categorised into three key sections: Individual Level Wellbeing
Supports; Community Level Wellbeing Supports; andStructural
Structural Level
Wellbeing Supports
Supports.
• Individual Level Wellbeing Supports – an ability to deal
with thoughts and feelings; emotional resilience; ability to
cope with stressful or adverse circumstances; a sense of
self; and the development of social skills.

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

103

• Community Level Wellbeing Supports – a sense of
belonging, social support and community participation.
• Structural Level Wellbeing Supports – social, economic
and cultural factors that are supportive of wellbeing. For
example: quality of housing, access to health and social
services and education, political and justice systems.

The outer circle
The out circle encapsulates what is happening throughout an
educational context in embedded practice, showing the School
Environment and Culture of Commitment to wellbeing through
‘Welcome Me, Know Me and Help Me to Learn’. An educational
context’s environment is reflective of all that happens within the
context’s community and it can be seen, heard and felt, often
through nuanced experiences. Table 5.1 highlights key
components of ‘Welcome Me, Know Me and Help Me to Learn’.

12 key pathways to embedding an education wide focus on wellbeing
Figure 5. 3 outlines 12 pathways to embedding an education wide
focus on wellbeing. Building on, and adapting Noble, McGrath,
Wyatt, Carbines and Robb’s research (2008), we suggest that there
are twelve key pathways that are essential in determining an
educational context’s contribution to embedding wellbeing within
a context’s community, in addition to identifying specific practices
that educational contexts can put in place to enhance wellbeing:
expert context leadership; strategic visioning; quality teaching and
learning; a supportive, caring and inclusive educational context; a
safe learning environment; social and emotional competencies; a
sense of meaning and purpose, including engaging student voice;

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

105

using, monitoring and evidencing strengths-based approaches;
strategies encouraging a healthy lifestyle; programs to develop prosocial values; family and community partnership; and spirituality.

1. Expert inclusive leadership
The promotion of student, staff and community wellbeing, through
effective inclusive leadership which:
• Empowers individuals and educational contexts to take
responsibility for both their own wellbeing and that of
others (Powell & Graham, 2017).
• Systematically monitors of student and staff wellbeing in
order to:
◦ Evaluate the impact of initiatives (Weare & Nind,
2011).
◦ Plan for future activities (Weare & Nind, 2011).
• Promotes staff development, health and wellbeing by
providing:
◦ Access to professional development to increase
personal knowledge of emotional wellbeing, and
to equip staff to be able to identify mental health
and wellbeing issues in their students (Price &
McCallum, 2015; 2016).
◦ Clear referral processes and pathways to a range
of relevant in and out of context support
strategies, structures and agencies for both staff
and students (Weare & Nind, 2011).
◦ Opportunities for assessing and supporting the
emotional health and wellbeing needs of staff
(McCallum & Price, 2010).

106

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

One way of enabling inclusive leadership is through the six
principles of inclusion captured in the model ‘A Conceptual Model
of the cultural indicators of an inclusive school‘ (Abawi, Carter,
Andrews & Conway, 2018) {Figure 5.4 below}.

Education, 33. doi:10.5772/intechopen.70358

2. Strategic visioning
Educational context communities that have a clear meaningful and
strategic vision promote the commitment of all members to pursue
their work with energy, self-discipline, collaboration and a keen
sense of purpose (Fullan, 2010). Strategic visioning is a guiding

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

107

process that is essentially concerned with forward thinking which
draw upon the beliefs, goals and the environment within
an educational context, and “if done correctly should be the
backbone of a positive and inspiring system” (Bainbridge, 2007,
p.1). The longer term benefits are significant and very real, as
strategic visioning can assist an educational context’s community
to “break free from convention and encourage thinking ‘outside
the box’” (Bainbridge, 2007, p.3). By clearly defining an educational
context’s direction and purpose, a strategic vision alerts all with the
context’s community where efforts should be directed in addition
to aligning resources and effort towards common goals. A strategic
vision should be underpinned by a shared philosophy that every
child has a right to learn and every child is capable of learning
and should be given the opportunity to actively participate in all
facets of school life (Carter & Abawi, 2018). It also provides a safe
environment where new ideas can be encouraged, and new ways
of working investigated in a safe and secure process.
Key Questions

•

How and why does strategic visioning contribute (or not contribute) to wellbeing
within your context?

•

Do all members of your context accept responsibility for developing and sustaining
wellbeing?

•

Are all members of your educational context community encouraged to actively
participate in developing, implementing, and / or evaluating wellbeing in your
context?

108

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

3. Quality teaching and learning
Quality teaching and learning involves the provision of varied,
engaging and inclusive high-quality pedagogy which:
• Focuses on the enhancement of student engagement
with learning.
• Uses cooperative learning and other relational teaching
strategies.
• Explicitly teaches skills and understandings related to
personal safety, protective behaviours, values and social
and emotional skills, and integrates this learning into the
mainstream processes of educational context life
(McCallum & Price, 2016).
• Provides early intervention and targeted student support
for children and young people already showing signs of
social, emotional and behavioural problems, or are at
greater risk of experiencing poorer mental health (Powell
& Graham, 2017).

Key Question

•

Do all members of your context accept responsibility for developing and sustaining
supportive teaching and learning that supports wellbeing?

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

109

4. A supportive, caring and inclusive educational context
community
Noble et al., (2008) suggest whole school community approaches
must promote an ethos and conditions for a supportive, caring and
inclusive community. We have built upon the conditions to include:
• feeling welcomed, valued, respected and free form
discrimination and harassment (Cahill & Freeman, 2007);
• having a sense of connectedness and are provided with
opportunities to develop deep personal connections with
other individuals and groups (Acton & Glasgow, 2015);
• creating a sense of belonging;
• treating people fairly;
• feeling included;
• experiencing mutual respecting (Abawi, Andersen &
Rogers, 2019).
• acknowledging and respecting diversity (Carter, S. 2019)
• demonstrating a positive view of self and having their
identity respected (Noble et al., 2008).
• experiencing positive peer and adult relationships which
have an affirmative influence on wellbeing, and which in
turn contributes to satisfaction, productivity and
achievement (McCallum, Price, Graham & Morrison,
2017).
• experiencing positive learning behaviours (Jamal, Fletcher,
Harden, Wells, Thomas & Bonell, 2013).
• respecting culture with connection to Country, kinship,
traditional knowledge, and identity (Panelli &Tipa, 2009).

110

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

5. A safe learning environment
An emotionally secure and safe environment with development
and application of ‘Safe Schools’ policies and procedures which:
• promotes positive safe and responsible behaviour,
respect, cooperation and inclusion (Abawi, Andersen &
Rogers, 2019);
• “prevent[s] and manage putdowns, bullying, and violence
and harassment threats.
• nurture and encourage student’s sense of self-worth and
self-efficacy.” (Noble et al.,2008, p.12);
• uses effective and safe communication strategies
(McCallum & Price, 2016);
• promotes productive and safe use of technologies {cyber
safety} as an enabler which supports wellbeing,
relationships and health, rather than focusing on negative
impacts of social media and online platforms (Spears,
2016);
• creates a culturally safe environment embedded with
positive social relationships (Panelli & Tipa, 2009);
• supports everyone to feel safe.
When people feel safe and have this basic need
are more able to concentrate on learning tasks.

•

How does trust, belonging and mutual respect contribute (or not contribute) to
wellbeing in your context?

•

How does (or does not) a positive sense of inclusiveness and/ or identity contribute
(or not contribute) to wellbeing in your context?

6. Social and emotional competencies
Social and emotional competencies enable individuals to learn how
to solve problems, manage feelings, manage friendships, promote
the ability to cope with difficulties, relate to others, resolve conflict,
and feel positive about themselves and the world around them.
By increasing social and emotional competence an individual’s
capacity to cope and stay healthy is increased (McCallum & Price,
2016) in spite of the negative factors that happen through life as
the social and emotional competencies act as buffers to wellbeing
depletion (Carter, 2016). Noble et al. (2016) suggest that social
and emotional competencies include being resilient, being able to
cope with difficult and stressful situations and events, engaging in
positive and optimistic thinking, having self-awareness, setting and
achieving goals, developing successful relationships and making
decisions. McCallum and Price (2016) add competencies such
problem-solving, conflict management and resolution, the ability to
work collaboratively, and the development of self-help skills that
enable individuals to utilise their own efforts and resources to
achieve wellbeing. Weare and Nind (2011) extend social and
emotional competencies even further by including an
understanding of, and managing feelings, and an understanding of,

112

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

and management of relationships with parents / carers, peers and
teachers.

7. A sense of meaning and purpose
Provision of as many opportunities as possible to participate in the
educational context and the wider community in order to develop
a sense of meaning or purpose including:
• Tasks that are worthwhile
• Service within the community.
• Civic responsibly and participation.
• Leadership within an educational context
• Contribution to the educational community.
• Providing peer support.
• Opportunities for student voice where student voice is
valued and invited.
• Engaging in activities that focus on the exploration of
spirituality (Noble et al., 2008).
Engaging student voice is important. Sometimes within schools,
conversations about student wellbeing and mental health can
often occur without discussions with students themselves about
these issues (Heysen & Mason, 2014). Substantial research points
to the benefits and value of involving children and young people in
decision making, as well provision of their points of view (Bessell,
2011). Research by Simmons, Graham and Thomas (2015) revealed
just how capable students were in “providing rich, nuanced
accounts of their experience that could potentially inform school
improvement” (p.129), with students often “identifying creative
ways that pedagogy, the school environment and relationships

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

113

could be improved, changed or maintained to assist their
wellbeing” (p.130). The voice of students within schools should then
be a central part of our conversations and plans as we “work out
how to nurture happy, balanced kids by actively engaging with
students…. about matters that concern them” (Heysen & Mason,
2014, p.15). Such findings highlight the importance of student voice
as a democratic, participatory and inclusive approach in schools.

Key Questions

•

Is social and emotional learning explicitly taught in your context? If so what, why,
how and how often?

•

How does (or does not) a sense of meaning and purpose contribute (or not
contribute) to student and staff wellbeing in your context?

8. Using, monitoring and evidencing strengths-based
approaches
Using a strengths-based approach involves educators discovering,
developing and harnessing their own talents, and maximising these
in the work domain to remain current in their field, implement
innovative curriculum in ways that meet the needs of all their
learners and to utilise feedback to continue to improve their
performance. Teachers can also inspire students to discover,
harness and maximise their own talents. Noble et al., (2008)
suggest the adoption of a strengths-based approach to
organisation, curriculum and planning should:
• Cater for the diversity of student character strengths.

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

114

• Cater for and extend all student intellectual levels.
• Value, develop and use in a meaningful way, the
individual and collective strengths of students, teachers
and parents.
Consider how you do this and also how you evidence that it has
occurred, including listening to and responding to feedback in
order to improve your practise.

9. Strategies encouraging a healthy lifestyle
A healthy life style approach is one that explicitly teaches students
the knowledge and skills needed for a healthy and self-respecting
life-style, and the support to apply the skills and knowledge to their
own lives. This includes a focus on:
• Good nutrition.
• Fitness and exercise.
• Avoidance of illegal drugs, alcohol and other self-harming
actions and situations.
Consider ways that encouraging a healthy lifestyle can be explicitly
evidenced in your practice.

10. Programs to develop pro-social values
Within schooling systems there are a number of programs that
develop pro-social values. According to Nobel et al. (2008), prosocial values programs explicitly teach and model values such as
honesty, respect, compassion, fairness, responsibility and
acceptance of difference, in addition to providing practical
opportunities to put values into practice within an educational

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

115

context and the wider community. Consider what your community
values and how reflective these values are of an inclusive and
multicultural society as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
perspectives. How do you evidence that inclusive pro-social
programs are occurring n your context?

Key Questions

•

Are strength-based approaches used within your context? If so, who are they used
with, and how and why do they contribute (or not contribute) to wellbeing within your
context?

•

Are strategies encouraging healthy lifestyle used within your context? If so, who
are they used with, how and why do they contribute (or not contribute) to wellbeing
within your context?

•

Are pro-social values explicitly taught in your context? If so what, why, how, and
how often?

11. Family and community partnerships
Well implemented interventions that support school and classroom
strategies for developing:
• Positive teacher-student relationships (Anderson &
Graham, 2016).
• Positive peer relationships (Cemalcilar, 2010).
• Positive school-family and school-community
relationships (Cemalcilar, 2010).

116

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

Students are engaged by through avenues that encourage:
• student voice (Anderson & Graham, 2016); and
• authentic involvement in learning, decision making and
peer-led approaches (McCallum & Price, 2016).
Parents/carers are also engaged in genuine participation,
particularly families that may feel blamed and/ or stigmatized
(Weare & Nind, 2011). This engagement is nuanced as it depends
on interests, skillsets and abilities. A challenge for schools is

to ensure that they have inclusive ways of engaging
and harnessing voices that may present differing
views or needs, including those of students with
disabilities, and Aboriginal and Torres Straight
Islander peoples (our first peoples). Listening to a
voice is the first step but importantly it is about
valuing diverse perspectives and engaging in
meeting the learning needs of all students,
teachers and educational leaders in the context.
Giving students a voice is important and suggests student-centred
teaching practices that place emphasise on a student’s interests
in a manner where the student feels valued (Waters, 2017). One
way of doing this could be the creation of a Student Council where
students are elected by their peers, participate in informed
decision making, and are empowered as advocates to have a
valued voice in what impacts them. If this is what the school has
chosen, we encourage you to look at the students selected and
consider the diversity of the group. Is there a representative for
students with disabilities? Is there a representative for Aboriginal
and Torres Straight Islander students? We suggest that schools
think creatively of ways to engage as many schools employ

a parent liaison officer to help create and maintain
parent engagement (Carter & Creedon, 2019) but

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

117

further, we encourage you to think reflectively
about whether the stakeholder groups do all
actually have a voice.
12. Spirituality
Spiritual wellbeing is considered by many to play an important part
in the promotion of general wellbeing, health and quality of life.
Eckersley (2007) defines spirituality as “a deeply intuitive, but not
always consciously expressed sense of connectedness to the world
in which we live” (p. 54), with wellbeing arising from the web of
relationships and interests that arise from that connectedness. De
Souza (2009) suggests that the term spirituality is inclusive of a
myriad religions and encompasses the notion of connection to a
higher being. Grieves (2006) argues that spirituality is a starting
point for wellbeing, and is understood and experienced within a
social, natural and material environment, which based upon the
cultural understandings that people have developed to enable
them to interact with their world.
As consequence, Yust, Johnson, Sasso, and Roehlkepartain (2006)
argue that spirituality plays a role in the wellbeing of both students
and staff, with spirituality being the factor in human life that
nurtures and gives expression to the inner and outer lives of
students and staff, which in turn promotes balance and wellbeing.
A study by Dobmeier and Reiner (2012) identified the following
mechanisms for developing spirituality within an educational
context:
• Reading spiritual autobiographies (Curtis & Glass, 2002).
• Engaging in role plays which challenge thinking and
discussion (Briggs & Dixon-Rayle, 2005).

118

• Using reflective journaling.
• Teaching the techniques of focusing, forgiveness, and

• Being exposed to a rage of panel presentations/guest
speakers who reflect on their own life journeys.
• Exploring spiritual readings (Briggs & Dixon Rayle, 2005).
• Engaging personal narratives.

Key Questions

•

Do family and community partnerships support wellbeing within your context? If
so, who are they used with, and how and why do they contribute (or not contribute)
to wellbeing within your context?

•

Is spirituality addressed within your context? If so, how is addressed and how does
it contribute (or not contribute) to wellbeing within your context?

WELLBEING RESOURCES
As part of the focus on wellbeing we encourage educational
contexts to regularly collect evidence of their practice. Figure 5.4
below features a snapshot of evidence of how students are
supported and engaged in their learning and we know from
research that this helps to contribute to a feeling of context
connectedness and belonging which is strongly linked to positive
wellbeing.

Conditions for success
Educational contexts are faced with the challenge of creating
a space to talk about, model and encourage healthy eating,
appreciating the peaceful moments and the beauty of the world,
and taking the time to exercise.
There is clear consensus in
the literature regarding the
importance of healthy eating.
Nutrition is a component that
now features in discussions
regarding
school
lunches,
tuckshop menus and access to
appropriate foods along with
education about nutrition. The

contexts is for staff to model
healthy eating and good
nutritional practices, the educational contexts to understand what
healthy eating is, and to embed a focus on good nutritional
practices in the day to day educational context community
language and ways of working.

Teach children and young
people to just take a moment
to appreciate the simple

explicitly ask children and
young people to note the
peaceful moments and the peaceful images, and to draw attention
to the positive elements in their daily lives by connecting to the
land we inhabit.

Research suggests that exercising is
good for people and contributes to
feelings of positive wellbeing. What does
this mean for educational contexts that
are committed to fostering wellbeing?
We suggest that educational contexts
need to discuss what this looks like in
practice
for
their
context
and
community, and how the context’s
practices can cater for diversity of
interest, culture, religion, and ability
while maximizing available resources.

In order for an education wide focus on wellbeing to be
successfully embedded, the following conditions are required in

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

123

order to create effective implementation and sustainability of
whole of educational context wellbeing initiatives:
• Shared vision and understanding of the concept of
wellbeing and shared ways of working to implement
the vision.
• Commitment from the whole educational context’s
community, not just the leader or leadership team
(McCallum & Price, 2016).
• A clear and widely understood shared language and
consistent processes for wellbeing across the whole
educational context’s community (Powell & Graham,
2017).
• A clearly identified student voice.
• Broad collaboration with the whole educational context’s
community (McCallum & Price, 2016).
• A shared moral purpose generated by the stakeholders
and communicated widely within the educational context,
created purpose, good communication and a sense of
ownership of any wellbeing initiatives (Noble et al., 2008).
• Use of ongoing formal and informal teacher professional
development including the involvement of acknowledged
experts Noble et al., 2008). We also suggest that teacher
aides and volunteers are included in professional
development opportunities in order to create a school
wide shared language and way of working with wellbeing.
• Fore fronting and promotion of student wellbeing as
being a priority across the whole educational community
(Noble et al., 2008).
• Explicit teaching of values such as respect, cooperation
support and social and emotional learning skills that

124

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

facilitate and encourage classroom participation, positive
interactions with teachers/peers and good study habits
(Noble et al., 2008).
• Clear expectations of behaviour which are modeled and
positively reinforced with shared celebratory moments.
• Ongoing and consistent support from school leadership
(Noble et al., 2008).
• Use of engaging and inclusive pedagogical approaches
(Noble et al., 2008) and innovative strategies that cater
for student needs and offer opportunities for extension
for all learners.
• Explicit links made to the goals of the educational context
and the system with students, teachers and the school
community having a clear shared understanding that
everyone can succeed and will be supported to do so.
• Processes in place to ensure and encourage a high
participation of all students in wellbeing initiatives.

We strongly support the suggestion by Noble
et al. (2008), stressing the importance of
appointing a wellbeing coordinator or team to
oversee the implementation of any wellbeing
initiatives. We also suggest that it is important
to analytically and critically review practice to
know when initiates are effectively achieving the
desired outcomes or when change is required
so that informed decision-making can occur.
Key Question

PRAGMATIC APPLICATIONS OF EMBEDDING AN EDUCATION
WIDE FOCUS ON WELLBEING

125

Consider the different perspectives that you need to take into account:
•

What does high participation look like, feel like and sound like for people
with disabilities, learning difficulties, English as second language or dialect, first
peoples, gifted and talented students, indeed for all individuals? How do you
evidence that this is occurring?

CONCLUSION
We, together with McCallum and Price (2016) argue that even
though academic achievement continues to be a high priority
within educational contexts, addressing wellbeing across the whole
educational community as well as in the learning environment,
curriculum, pedagogy, policies, procedures and partnerships
domains, is of upmost importance.
By investing in whole of educational context wellbeing programs
and initiatives in conjunction with academic development,
Scoffham and Barnes (2011) likewise argue that there will be
significant benefits not only for student wellbeing, but also to
student achievement, teacher wellbeing and productivity.
Wellbeing then requires a whole educational context approach,
where wellbeing is embedded in a context’s policies, curriculum,
structures and practices, and as a shared responsibility of all
stakeholders. This Chapter has endeavoured to grow thinking
about wellbeing behaviour and ecology, as well as highlighting a
way of evidencing and supporting wellbeing growth, emphasising
the importance of aligning the values of an educational context,
and ways of working, with the pathways that help enable wellbeing.

Forming connections and fitting in is associated with positive

INTRODUCTION
There is increasing understanding that educational contexts have
an important role to play in supporting the social and emotional
development of children and young people. Interventions
undertaken in educational context settings have the potential to
influence a range of social, health and mental health outcomes.
Evidence suggests that good mental and physical health not only
optimises a young person’s academic performance but also
enhances the ability to cope with the challenges and stressors of

ECOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF WELLBEING: IN

daily life, and thereby to become a productive member of society in
the longer term.
We draw your attention to wellbeing considerations for all people
but especially challenge you to think about how you meet the
needs of people with disabilities, some of whom have a
comorbidity of disabilities or special needs, may be profoundly
disabled and could also be non-verbal. Consider also the stress
factors that may be present in some families who are dealing with
very complex and challenging issues. How best can we then
understand the complex needs of an individual?
Although wellbeing can be seen principally as relating to the
individual, a social conception of wellbeing transfers attention to
the interplay of individuals, incorporating the social and cultural
dimensions that they arbitrate as contributing to their satisfaction
with life. This Chapter explores ecological and contextual analysis
of wellbeing using evidence based and contextual self-assessment
as a means of understanding the concept of wellbeing from an
individual, classroom, educational context, and system perspective,
and what is exactly occurring within your own educational
community context. In this chapter we also suggest a way of
developing a wellbeing framework based upon evidence-based
practice and we include numerous practical templates for use or
adaption. We acknowledge the limitations of some of the templates
when applied in various settings such as early childhood, special
education units, and we seek your input to co-create more
meaningful resources. Please feel welcome to contact us, our
details in the Foreword section of this book.
Activity

Before undertaking an ecological and contextual analysis of wellbeing within your own
context, consider what both terms might mean for you, and how they might apply to your
context.

138

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

Let’s now examine how literature defines contextual and ecological
analysis. Spencer (2007) defines ecological analysis as an
investigation of the relationship between individuals and each
other, and their relationship to their physical surroundings. Wu
and David (2002) expanded this a little further by proposing that
individuals’ perceptions about settings and their experiences within
an environment matter, and that ecological analysis is a process of
understanding how individuals’ experiences contribute to ‘making
sense’ of situations and experiences negotiated progressively over
time and place. Thus, an ecological analysis of wellbeing provides
an opportunity to investigate the wide variety of bidirectional, and
individual-context interactions that in turn, contribute to the
construct that is well being. George et al., (2015) define context as
the circumstances that impact on a setting or event, and contextual
analysis as the process of understanding the broader range of
relationships that influence the outcome of a subject being
investigated within that setting or event. Thus, according to Smith,
Montagno, and Kuzmenko (2004), a contextual analysis is an
analysis of a context within both its historical and cultural setting,
the qualities that characterize it, and the characteristics of the
ecology/environment that influence these.
An ecological and contextual analysis of wellbeing within a
specific context /worksite offers an opportunity to investigate
information about whether or not an approach / strategy /
intervention ‘fits’ within the context in which it has been
implemented, and provides a ‘snapshot’ of measurable community
characteristics and evidence as to whether a wellbeing strategy has
been implemented effectively, has been useful, and/ or has been
accepted by a particular community.

FACTORS INFLUENCING WELLBEING
The World Health Organization {WHO} (2013) identifies supporting
environments for well-being to be a key responsibility of
educational contexts. WHO (2013) points to a range of research
which has found that educational context connectedness, or the
feeling of closeness to context staff and the context’s environment
decreases the likelihood of health risk behaviours during
adolescence. Educational contexts with a climate of confidence and
respect among principals,staff,pupils and parents reflect the lowest
rates of general anxiety,school anxiety and emotional and
psychosomatic balance among children and young people.
“A positive educational experience and a good level of academic
achievement can contribute significantly to enhancing self-esteem
and confidence, better employment, life opportunities and social
support” (Department of Education and Skills Health Service
Executive and Department of Health {DESHSEDH}, 2013, p.8). Life
skills education, strongly supported by Weare and Nind (2011) and
the WHO (2013), are viewed as a preventive measures for a range
of health and social problems, and include the development of
skills such as: decision making/ problem solving; creative thinking/
critical thinking; communication/ interpersonal skills; selfawareness/ empathy; coping with emotions/ coping with stress.
In contrast, poor engagement and achievement in an educational
context setting is a risk factor for a range of social, health and
mental health problems such as substance misuse, unwanted
teenage pregnancy, crime and conduct problems.
A study by Kidger, Gunnell, Biddle, Campbell, and Donovan
(2010) identified that teachers also were a key factor influencing
the emotional health and well being of students. However, Kidger
et al. (2010) also noted that in instances where teachers’ own
emotional health needs were neglected, this left them with little
ability, and in some cases an unwillingness, to cater for the
wellbeing of students. The findings from the study conclusively

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

140

endorsed whole-school approaches to wellbeing which also
focused on teachers’ training and support needs. This study
highlights the importance of wellbeing programs that focus on the
whole educational community context, fore fronting the health and
wellbeing of all staff and all students.
Broadly speaking then, factors that have an influence on
wellbeing across all populations can be grouped into three key
areas: individual, community and structural.
Key Questions

Consider your own context for a moment.
•

What factors influence wellbeing within your own context? What factors can your
school influence?

•

What supports are currently in place within your context that support the positive
development of wellbeing?

BRONFENBRENNER’S ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
THEORY
Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) Ecological Systems Theory summarised
decades of theory and research about the fundamental
progressions that guide life-span development, and stressed the
importance of studying an individual within the context of the
multiple environments in which they are positioned (Darling, 2007).
Bronfenbrenner defined this as an ecological system which
contributed to understanding of how a person grows and develops,
which in turn develops a deeper understanding of individuals, their
needs and their wellbeing. Ecological Systems Theory then has

ECOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF WELLBEING: IN
YOUR CONTEXT

141

potential to be a useful framework for understanding how inherent
qualities of an individual’s environment interacts to influence how
they develop and grow.
Within this theory, Bronfenbrenner (1979) devised classifications
for various levels and degrees of intervening influence on a
person’s development, with these systems referred to as a “system
of layers, with each layer located inside the other, similar to that
of Russian nesting dolls” (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, p. 22).
Bronfenbrenner’s perspective reinforced the critical and pervasive
role that the Microsystem {the immediate environment of the
individual including everyone that they interact with on a regular
basis.}; the Mesosystem {the interaction between members/
components of the microsystem}; the Exosystem {the broader
environment that directly affects the immediate environment of
the individual}; the Macrosystem{the overarching system that
consists of culture, laws, economy, politics, etc}; and the
Chronosystem {how certain variable affect the individual over
time, including life events and changes in socioeconomic status}
had on influencing an individual’s behaviour, as shown in Figure
6.2.

Since Bronfenbrenner’s initial Ecological Systems Theory theory
was proposed, Bowes and Hayes (1999) have added several other
components to Bronfenbrenner’s model. Firstly, individual
characteristics were introduced, such as temperament and gender,
followed by the addition of historical factors impacting on current
behaviours attitudes and practices, with the acknowledgment that
these vary over time.
Within this extended Ecological Systems Theory model:

ECOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF WELLBEING: IN
YOUR CONTEXT

143

• The microsystem is the smallest and most immediate
and most intimate of environments {e.g., daily home}, and
includes those interactions which occur closest to the
individual.
• The mesosystem includes the interaction of the
different microsystems such as, linkages between home
and school, between peer group and family.
• The exosystem pertains to the linkages that may exist
between two or more settings, one of which may not
contain the child or young person but affects the child or
young person indirectly. This could be other people and
places which the child or young person may not directly
interact with but may still have an effect on the child or
young person {e.g., care giver’/ parents’ workplaces}.
• The macrosystem, understood to be more distant from
the child or young person, includes influences such as
cultural beliefs, values and practices from the wider
community. Bronfenbrenner (1995) claimed that we
experience “progressively more complex reciprocal
interaction between an active evolved bio-psychological
human organism and the persons, objects, and symbols
in its immediate environment… this interaction must
occur on a fairly regular basis…. Such enduring forms of
interaction in the immediate environment are referred to
as proximal processes” (Bronfenbrenner, 1995, p.621).
• The chronosystem contributes the useful dimension of
time, which demonstrates the influence of both change
and constancy in the child’s / young person’s
environment. The chronosystem may therefore include a
change in family structure, residence, parental
employment status, and social and political changes such
as housing market crashes. Bronfenbrenner’s ecological
systems theory is useful beyond the developing child /

144

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

young person but has application to any individual’s
development.
Activity

Consider Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model and reflect on how this model may be useful in
helping teachers to better understand and support their students.

Other researchers have applied and adapted Bronfenbrenner’s
model to understandings about particular disabilities. A biomedical
model has powerfully shaped and historically been a key way of
understanding and supporting mental health in children and young
people (Deanon, 2013). More recently, the emergence of a body of
early childhood and health literature has recognised the influence
which biological, psychological and social factors can have on
children’s / young people’s health, learning and development.
(Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing {ADHA},
2014)
However, while the Ecological Systems Theory Model offers a
potential framework for use in an ecological and contextual
analysis of wellbeing within a educational context and community,
Armitage, Béné, Charles, Johnson, and Allison (2012) argue that
caution needs to be exercised in using only one framework or
approach in the analysis of wellbeing. Instead Armitage et al.,
(2012) propose “the development of hybrid approaches and
innovative combinations of social and ecological theory in order
to provide signposts and analytical tools to understand complexity
and change” (p.12) with an educational context.

Consider your own context for a moment and the supports that you believe are in place for
the positive development of wellbeing.
1.

Construct an ecological model for yourself and your own wellbeing in your work
context.

2.

Construct an ecological model for someone whose wellbeing you are concerned
about in your work context.

DEVELOPING AN EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT
FRAMEWORK
It is suggested that educational contexts develop a framework to
ensure that wellbeing is an explicit focus within the educational
community. The question then becomes, what goes into the
framework. Reviewing the information shared in Chapter 3,
Garrison (2011) defined a framework as a set of beliefs, rules or
thinking that outline what actions can be undertaken. White (2010)
suggested that a wellbeing framework is “a social process with
material, relational, and subjective dimensions” (p.158). We suggest
that a wellbeing framework should align with the beliefs and values
espoused by the educational community context; clearly outline
the shared definition underpinned by a deep knowledge of the
possible impactors and enablers to wellbeing; include pathways
for enactment; and ways it be evaluated at individual, community
and structural levels where educational context community input
is sought with open communication and relationships as central
components. We suggest that your framework begins with your
educational context vision and beliefs. In the following section we

146

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

suggest that you use a model, guiding questions and a checklist and
surveys to evaluate your progress.

HOW IS WELLBEING EVIDENCED
At the start of the chapter we posed a guiding question for you
to consider. The guiding question was how is wellbeing enhanced?
How do you know what you know about wellbeing? What are you
using to evidence your judgements? What follows are photographic
examples, and resources for use in educational contexts that have
been developed to assist you in investigating wellbeing within your
own educational communities. The resources have been provided
as a guide, a way of working to inform your wellbeing journey,
and as a means of ensuring that your judgements are evidenced
based. The examples may be adapted to suit different models and
educational communities. We suggest that you use a variety of
artefacts to evidence practice. This gathering of evidence could be
done at a classroom level by individual teachers; a year levels/
teaching teams; and a whole of educational context level.

SCHOOL EXAMPLES OF PRACTICE
Creating a sense of belonging where people are connected to the
educational context , feel safe and also know that they have
realistic learning opportunities, helps to nurture wellbeing. We
have taken a variety of photographs to help model how elements
of wellbeing promotion can be evidenced. There are many ways
to see wellbeing within an educational context, and the following
(Figures 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6) illustrate a small snapshot of possible
ideas.

ECOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF WELLBEING: IN

Values are clearly displayed
in multiple places throughout
the school contributing to a
culture of care and respect for
other (see Figure 6.3). These
same values are on display in

staffroom and the meeting
rooms, are linked to verbally in
every parade, and associated with positive reinforcement through
STAR awards.
Educational contexts should be committed to providing safe,
inviting and welcoming learning spaces so that students experience
a feeling of belonging. These spaces should also be places of quality
learning and teaching where the learning needs of each individual
are acknowledged and catered for so that success as determined
differently by each individual, can be experienced and celebrated
(as shown in Figure 6.4).

Below in Figure 6.6, a shared language is evidence around the
establishment of a shared professional dialogue and way of
working where all students are welcome, teachers are challenged
to create a sense of belonging for every student and the needs of
individual students are a key focus through ‘Welcome Me, Know
Me, and Help Me to Learn’.

Me, Know Me, Help Me to Learn’. (2018), Australia, USQ Photography.

This photograph captures a way of working where the needs of
the child are fore fronted and the focus is on student engagement
in learning. The photograph was taken in the meeting room and
‘Welcome Me’, ‘Know Me’, and ‘Help Me Learn’ regularly featured
in pedagogical discussion, year levels meetings and staff meetings.
Teachers and teacher aides are also engaged in professional
development opportunities to further enhance their understanding
was to be enacted.

RESOURCES FOR USE IN SCHOOLS TO FORMULATE A
WELLBEING FRAMEWORK
We suggest that your framework begins with your educational
context vision and beliefs. We assume that this has already been

ECOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF WELLBEING: IN
YOUR CONTEXT

151

developed and regularly reviewed with your context’s annual plan.
By linking it specifically to the wellbeing framework alignment can
be scaffolded.
1. In the following section we suggest that you use a model
and we have provided a template:
• Table 6.1 Growing Inclusive Wellbeing, in a word format
(also shown as Figure 6.7)

2. We have then provided a list of guiding questions:
• Table 6.2 Guiding Questions

3. There is also a possible checklist/ brainstorm sheet for
data gathering of possible impactors and enablers and
potential school response actions.
• Table 6.3 Checklist for enablers and impactors.

4. We have provided a checklist for data gathering
information about whole school wellbeing.
• Table 6.4 Whole educational community growing inclusive
wellbeing checklist

5. We have linked a variety of surveys to inform your
thinking and these surveys are targeted at different
groups.

152

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

• Table 6.5 Survey on wellbeing;
• Table 6.6 Individual level growing inclusive wellbeing
checklist for the Principal and school staff;
• Table 6.7 Individual wellbeing level growing inclusive
wellbeing checklist for students
While we have provided the surveys in a template form there is
no reason that these surveys could to be redeveloped and used in
a multi-modal format (e.g., Survey Monkey) and made to suit your
specific context. In providing a range of surveys it is hoped that
you can select what best suits your context and /or to use different
surveys at differing times of the year and cross validate the data
findings {e.g., beginning or end of the year}.

START WITH THE VISION, VALUES AND A MODEL
The text in the following section has the various resources, labelled
as Tables, hyperlinked as word documents so that you can use
the resources and personalise them for your context. We suggest
you start with a model (word form hyperlinked here (Table 6.1
Growing Inclusive Wellbeing), also shown below as a snapshot of
the template (Figure 6.7: ‘Growing Inclusive Wellbeing’).

GUIDING QUESTIONS FOR SCHOOLS
We recognise that educational contexts are unique contexts full of

154

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

creative people and we expect that each educational context will
generate other questions to guide their designing, enacting and
reflecting upon wellbeing. We know that educational contexts are
also busy places and that judgments are made that are not always
evidenced based and these judgments are not always correct. We
encourage critical reflection and challenge you to try to uncover
assumptions and practices that may or may not promote wellbeing.
Further to this we hope that every educational contexts
endeavours to engage all members in growing inclusive wellbeing.
In the Hyperlinked activity below, we provide some guiding
questions to help school communities on their journey with
wellbeing. We also provide some challenge questions around a
simple thinking frame of ‘Welcome Me’, ‘Know Me’, and ‘Help Me
Learn’.
This way of thinking – ‘Welcome Me’, ‘Know Me’, and ‘Help Me
Learn’, when enacted can become part of an embedded inclusive
culture that enables wellbeing for everyone. People can use this
to support the special needs of each individual whether they are a
student, a parent, a teacher or another staff member.
Scenario

Angela, a new single mother arrives at the school and

enrolls her year 6 child Jo. Upon

enrollment Angela is introduced to the school community liaison officer who takes the time
to try and get to know Angela and establish the beginnings of a positive relationship with
Angela. This is the ‘welcome me’ in action.
Jo, the year 6 student is away from school for several days.

Activity

ECOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF WELLBEING: IN

•

155

What assumption does the class teacher make? What action needs to occur?

As part of the ‘Welcome Me’ a possible way of working that
may help to establish educational context belonging is for the
educational context community liaison officer, as part of their
regular routine work, to call the family on day three at the school,
at the end of week 2 and then at the end of term. Imagine if the
parent liaison officer telephones the mother and it is revealed that
the mother’s car has broken down and she cannot afford to fix
it and so has no way of getting Jo to school. This is the ‘Know
Me’ in action. With this information the parent liaison officer can
then utilise networks and contextual understandings and linkage
with others to ensure that Jo is transported to and from school.
Consider how this may benefit Jo in terms of learning, engage,
school connectedness and wellbeing. If the community liaison
officer makes Angela and Jo aware of the local bus and church
community groups that can help ensure transport to and from
shops and possible medical appointments while Angela is saving
money to fix the car, this then becomes the ‘Help Me Learn’.
Angela and Jo can then learn about how to link into community
networks to ensure their needs are meet. The expectation is then
not one of learned helplessness but one of learning how to engage
with school community networks. Consider also if Angela had
English as a second language and was a refugee. Consider how
hard would it be for Jo to engage in quality teaching and learning
and have positive wellbeing. ‘Welcome Me, Know Me and Help
Me to Learn’ can be enacted for anyone through whole school
community commitment and a shared knowledge language and
way of working. In Table 6.2 Guiding Questions, we model a way
of questioning that links to ‘Welcome Me, Know Me and Help Me to
Learn’.

156

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

Hyperlinked here is a word document which may be of use,
Table 6.3 Checklist for Enablers and Impactors which outlines a
possible brainstorm list that schools can use to consider impactors
and enablers. This checklist is useful to explore:
• Can impactors be mitigated? If so how?
• Can enablers be further developed? If so How?
We have not listed all of the impactors and enablers, rather we
have brainstormed a base list that school communities can add
to and contextualise. We suggest using this checklist firstly from
the perspective of the individual child, or individual teacher,
individual principal or other staff member. This could be completed
by the individual themselves and then the how do you know
conversation could involve a buddy, mentor, or trusted other
person. We then suggest that this same sheet could be of use when
you look from the educational context‘s community perspective
(e.g. what supports are evident from the context’s community for
an individual with their academic performance; with their
homework etc) and this should be done with input from all
stakeholder groups, staff, students and parents/caregivers.

GROWING INCLUSIVE WELLBEING CHECKLIST
The following evidence-based practice checklist utilises the 12
pathways to wellbeing (outlined in chapter 5). In this checklist
evidence refers to information, processes, strategies, ways of
working and data that are implemented or happening in the
context. Evidence provides information in relation to whether a
process, strategy or way of working, is feasible to implement;
useful; likely to be accepted by a school community; and whether it
is a potential vehicle for change. The term artefact refers to those
items, things, policies and awards, that are captured in moment

ECOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF WELLBEING: IN
YOUR CONTEXT

157

{e.g., a photograph} and these are physical forms of evidence.
Evidence such as artefacts offer a ‘snapshot’ of wellbeing within
an educational community context. Please use Table 6.4 Whole
Educational Community Growing Inclusive Wellbeing Checklist.

SURVEY ON WELLBEING
We suggest that you work with all stakeholder groups and alter
the wording on the survey captured here in Table 6.5 Survey on
wellbeing . We have also included here an individual survey for the
educational leader / principal/ school staff which can be modified
to best suit your context, captured here in Table 6.6 Individual level
growing inclusive wellbeing checklist for the Principal and School
Staff . We have also included an individual survey captured her
in Table 6.7 Individual wellbeing level- growing inclusive wellbeing
checklist for students that specifically targets students and we
encourage you to modify it so it is age appropriate and context
specific . The surveys are designed to find out what works and what
isn’t working and ways for improvement. We strongly encourage
educational contexts to build upon their strengths. The surveys
can be used in conjunction with normal data gathering cycles and
may be useful in informing evidenced-based student and staff
engagement discussions. The educational community can then
consider how to collate, share, analyse and respond to the data and
we suggest that existing committee structures could be used so a
focus on wellbeing becomes an embedded way of working.

SUMMARY
This chapter explored the ecological and contextual analysis of
wellbeing using evidence based and contextual self-assessment

158

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

as a means of understanding the concept of wellbeing from an
individual, educational context, and system level, and challenges
educational communities to review what is occurring within their
context. Research clearly highlights the importance of a whole of
context approach on wellbeing. As authors and educators, we hope
that the material shared within this text has been useful in
furthering your understanding of wellbeing and in offering
suggestions for the development and implementation of a
whole education context wellbeing program and focus.

In this text ‘Wellbeing in Educational Contexts’ we have
161

162

CARTER, SUSAN AND CECILY ANDERSEN

encouraged readers to to look at what is occurring in your
educational context, remembering there are many ways to view
the same picture, (e.g., seeing the joyous colours and expressions
or the cleanup required after the painting) depending upon which
lens is used and what assumptions unpin thinking and behaviour.
We have endeavoured to synthesize some current research that
links to educational contexts and make a new contribution to the
field by presenting a model “Growing Inclusive Wellbeing” and
possible templates that can help guide educational contexts to
formulate their own wellbeing framework that is based upon
evidence-based practice.
In chapter one we charted a possible way of meaning making
through engaging with the text and prior knowledge. In chapter two
we explored various theoretical conceptualisations of wellbeing
using the guiding question: what is wellbeing? In chapter three we
presented policy, frameworks and legislation that has informed the
emphasis on wellbeing using the guiding question: how is wellbeing
enacted? In chapter four we outlined possible impactors and
enablers to wellbeing through the guiding question: how is
wellbeing enhanced? In chapter five we explored ways of
embedding an education wide focus on wellbeing using the guiding
question: how is wellbeing enacted and embedded? In the final
chapter we explored the ecological and contextual analysis of
wellbeing in relation to a workplace wellbeing framework through
the guiding question: how can wellbeing be enacted and promoted
in my context? We also presented resources for use in educational
contexts.
We sincerely hope that the material presented has been useful
to readers in deepening their knowledge of wellbeing and also in
providing some guidance into how a framework can be developed
and then wellbeing embedded.
