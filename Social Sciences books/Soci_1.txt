Introduction
Welcome to Child Growth and Development. This text is a presentation of how and why
children grow, develop, and learn.
We will look at how we change physically over time from conception through adolescence. We
examine cognitive change, or how our ability to think and remember changes over the first 20
years or so of life. And we will look at how our emotions, psychological state, and social
relationships change throughout childhood and adolescence.1

Principles of Development
There are several underlying principles of development to keep in mind:
 Development is lifelong and change is apparent across the lifespan (although this text
ends with adolescence). And early experiences affect later development.
 Development is multidirectional. We show gains in some areas of development, while
showing loss in other areas.
 Development is multidimensional. We change across three general
domains/dimensions; physical, cognitive, and social and emotional.
 The physical domain includes changes in height and weight, changes in gross and
fine motor skills, sensory capabilities, the nervous system, as well as the
propensity for disease and illness.
 The cognitive domain encompasses the changes in intelligence, wisdom,
perception, problem-solving, memory, and language.
 The social and emotional domain (also referred to as psychosocial) focuses on
changes in emotion, self-perception, and interpersonal relationships with
families, peers, and friends.

All three domains influence each other. It is also important to note that a change in one domain
may cascade and prompt changes in the other domains.
 Development is characterized by plasticity, which is our ability to change and that many
of our characteristics are malleable. Early experiences are important, but children are
remarkably resilient (able to overcome adversity).
 Development is multicontextual.2 We are influenced by both nature (genetics) and
nurture (the environment) - when and where we live and our actions, beliefs, and values
are a response to circumstances surrounding us. The key here is to understand that
behaviors, motivations, emotions, and choices are all part of a bigger picture.3
Now let’s look at a framework for examining development.

Periods of Development
Think about what periods of development that you think a course on Child Development would
address. How many stages are on your list? Perhaps you have three: infancy, childhood, and
teenagers. Developmentalists (those that study development) break this part of the life span
into these five stages as follows:
 Prenatal Development (conception through birth)
 Infancy and Toddlerhood (birth through two years)
 Early Childhood (3 to 5 years)
 Middle Childhood (6 to 11 years)
 Adolescence (12 years to adulthood)
This list reflects unique aspects of the various stages of childhood and adolescence that will be
explored in this book. So while both an 8 month old and an 8 year old are considered children,
they have very different motor abilities, social relationships, and cognitive skills. Their
nutritional needs are different and their primary psychological concerns are also distinctive.

Prenatal Development
Conception occurs and development begins. All of the major structures of the body are forming
and the health of the mother is of primary concern. Understanding nutrition, teratogens (or
environmental factors that can lead to birth defects), and labor and delivery are primary
concerns.

Figure 1.1 - A tiny embryo depicting some development of arms and legs, as well as facial features that are starting
to show. 4

Infancy and Toddlerhood
The two years of life are ones of dramatic growth and change. A newborn, with a keen sense of
hearing but very poor vision is transformed into a walking, talking toddler within a relatively
short period of time. Caregivers are also transformed from someone who manages feeding and
sleep schedules to a constantly moving guide and safety inspector for a mobile, energetic child.

Figure 1.2 - A swaddled newborn. 5

Early Childhood
Early childhood is also referred to as the preschool years and consists of the years which follow
toddlerhood and precede formal schooling. As a three to five-year-old, the child is busy learning
language, is gaining a sense of self and greater independence, and is beginning to learn the

workings of the physical world. This knowledge does not come quickly, however, and
preschoolers may initially have interesting conceptions of size, time, space and distance such as
fearing that they may go down the drain if they sit at the front of the bathtub or by
demonstrating how long something will take by holding out their two index fingers several
inches apart. A toddler’s fierce determination to do something may give way to a four-yearold’s sense of guilt for action that brings the disapproval of others.

Figure 1.3 - Two young children playing in the Singapore Botanic Gardens 6

Middle Childhood
The ages of six through eleven comprise middle childhood and much of what children
experience at this age is connected to their involvement in the early grades of school. Now the
world becomes one of learning and testing new academic skills and by assessing one’s abilities
and accomplishments by making comparisons between self and others. Schools compare
students and make these comparisons public through team sports, test scores, and other forms
of recognition. Growth rates slow down and children are able to refine their motor skills at this
point in life. And children begin to learn about social relationships beyond the family through
interaction with friends and fellow students.

Adolescence
Adolescence is a period of dramatic physical change marked by an overall physical growth spurt
and sexual maturation, known as puberty. It is also a time of cognitive change as the adolescent
begins to think of new possibilities and to consider abstract concepts such as love, fear, and
freedom. Ironically, adolescents have a sense of invincibility that puts them at greater risk of
dying from accidents or contracting sexually transmitted infections that can have lifelong
consequences.8

Figure 1.5 - Two smiling teenage women.9

There are some aspects of development that have been hotly debated. Let’s explore these.

Issues in Development
Nature and Nurture
Why are people the way they are? Are features such as height, weight, personality, being
diabetic, etc. the result of heredity or environmental factors-or both? For decades, scholars
have carried on the "nature/nurture" debate. For any particular feature, those on the side of
Nature would argue that heredity plays the most important role in bringing about that feature.
Those on the side of Nurture would argue that one's environment is most significant in shaping
the way we are. This debate continues in all aspects of human development, and most scholars
agree that there is a constant interplay between the two forces. It is difficult to isolate the root
of any single behavior as a result solely of nature or nurture.

Continuity versus Discontinuity
Is human development best characterized as a slow, gradual process, or is it best viewed as one
of more abrupt change? The answer to that question often depends on which developmental
theorist you ask and what topic is being studied. The theories of Freud, Erikson, Piaget, and
Kohlberg are called stage theories. Stage theories or discontinuous development assume that
developmental change often occurs in distinct stages that are qualitatively different from each

other, and in a set, universal sequence. At each stage of development, children and adults have
different qualities and characteristics. Thus, stage theorists assume development is more
discontinuous. Others, such as the behaviorists, Vygotsky, and information processing theorists,
assume development is a more slow and gradual process known as continuous development.
For instance, they would see the adult as not possessing new skills, but more advanced skills
that were already present in some form in the child. Brain development and environmental
experiences contribute to the acquisition of more developed skills.

Figure 1.6 – The graph to the left shows three stages in the continuous growth of a tree. The graph to the right
shows four distinct stages of development in the life cycle of a ladybug.10

Active versus Passive
How much do you play a role in your own developmental path? Are you at the whim of your
genetic inheritance or the environment that surrounds you? Some theorists see humans as
playing a much more active role in their own development. Piaget, for instance believed that
children actively explore their world and construct new ways of thinking to explain the things
they experience. In contrast, many behaviorists view humans as being more passive in the
developmental process.11
How do we know so much about how we grow, develop, and learn? Let’s look at how that data
is gathered through research

Research Methods
An important part of learning any science is having a basic knowledge of the techniques used in
gathering information. The hallmark of scientific investigation is that of following a set of
procedures designed to keep questioning or skepticism alive while describing, explaining, or
10

testing any phenomenon. Some people are hesitant to trust academicians or researchers
because they always seem to change their story. That, however, is exactly what science is all
about; it involves continuously renewing our understanding of the subjects in question and an
ongoing investigation of how and why events occur. Science is a vehicle for going on a neverending journey. In the area of development, we have seen changes in recommendations for
nutrition, in explanations of psychological states as people age, and in parenting advice. So
think of learning about human development as a lifelong endeavor.
Take a moment to write down two things that you know about childhood. Now, how do you
know? Chances are you know these things based on your own history (experiential reality) or
based on what others have told you or cultural ideas (agreement reality) (Seccombe and
Warner, 2004). There are several problems with personal inquiry. Read the following sentence
aloud:
Paris in the
the spring
Are you sure that is what it said? Read it again:
Paris in the
the spring
If you read it differently the second time (adding the second “the”) you just experienced one of
the problems with personal inquiry; that is, the tendency to see what we believe. Our
assumptions very often guide our perceptions, consequently, when we believe something, we
tend to see it even if it is not there. This problem may just be a result of cognitive ‘blinders’ or it
may be part of a more conscious attempt to support our own views. Confirmation bias is the
tendency to look for evidence that we are right and in so doing, we ignore contradictory
evidence. Popper suggests that the distinction between that which is scientific and that which is
unscientific is that science is falsifiable; scientific inquiry involves attempts to reject or refute a
theory or set of assumptions (Thornton, 2005). Theory that cannot be falsified is not scientific.
And much of what we do in personal inquiry involves drawing conclusions based on what we
have personally experienced or validating our own experience by discussing what we think is
true with others who share the same views.
Science offers a more systematic way to make comparisons guard against bias.

Scientific Methods
One method of scientific investigation involves the following steps:
1. Determining a research question
2. Reviewing previous studies addressing the topic in question (known as a literature
review)
3. Determining a method of gathering information
4. Conducting the study
14 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

5. Interpreting results
6. Drawing conclusions; stating limitations of the study and suggestions for future research
7. Making your findings available to others (both to share information and to have your
work scrutinized by others)
Your findings can then be used by others as they explore the area of interest and through this
process a literature or knowledge base is established. This model of scientific investigation
presents research as a linear process guided by a specific research question. And it typically
involves quantifying or using statistics to understand and report what has been studied. Many
academic journals publish reports on studies conducted in this manner.
Another model of research referred to as qualitative research may involve steps such as these:
1. Begin with a broad area of interest
2. Gain entrance into a group to be researched
3. Gather field notes about the setting, the people, the structure, the activities or other
areas of interest
4. Ask open ended, broad “grand tour” types of questions when interviewing subjects
5. Modify research questions as study continues
6. Note patterns or consistencies
7. Explore new areas deemed important by the people being observed
8. Report findings
In this type of research, theoretical ideas are “grounded” in the experiences of the participants.
The researcher is the student and the people in the setting are the teachers as they inform the
researcher of their world (Glazer & Strauss, 1967). Researchers are to be aware of their own
biases and assumptions, acknowledge them and bracket them in efforts to keep them from
limiting accuracy in reporting. Sometimes qualitative studies are used initially to explore a topic
and more quantitative studies are used to test or explain what was first described.

Research Methods
Let’s look more closely at some techniques, or research methods, used to describe, explain, or
evaluate. Each of these designs has strengths and weaknesses and is sometimes used in
combination with other designs within a single study.

Observational Studies
Observational studies involve watching and recording the actions of participants. This may take
place in the natural setting, such as observing children at play at a park, or behind a one-way
glass while children are at play in a laboratory playroom. The researcher may follow a checklist
and record the frequency and duration of events (perhaps how many conflicts occur among 2year-olds) or may observe and record as much as possible about an event (such as observing
children in a classroom and capturing the details about the room design and what the children
and teachers are doing and saying). In general, observational studies have the strength of
allowing the researcher to see how people behave rather than relying on self-report. What
15 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

people do and what they say they do are often very different. A major weakness of
observational studies is that they do not allow the researcher to explain causal relationships.
Yet, observational studies are useful and widely used when studying children. Children tend to
change their behavior when they know they are being watched (known as the Hawthorne
effect) and may not survey well.

Experiments
Experiments are designed to test hypotheses (or specific statements about the relationship
between variables) in a controlled setting in efforts to explain how certain factors or events
produce outcomes. A variable is anything that changes in value. Concepts are operationalized
or transformed into variables in research, which means that the researcher must specify exactly
what is going to be measured in the study.
Three conditions must be met in order to establish cause and effect. Experimental designs are
useful in meeting these conditions.
1. The independent and dependent variables must be related. In other words, when one is
altered, the other changes in response. (The independent variable is something altered
or introduced by the researcher. The dependent variable is the outcome or the factor
affected by the introduction of the independent variable. For example, if we are looking
at the impact of exercise on stress levels, the independent variable would be exercise;
the dependent variable would be stress.)
2. The cause must come before the effect. Experiments involve measuring subjects on the
dependent variable before exposing them to the independent variable (establishing a
baseline). So we would measure the subjects’ level of stress before introducing exercise
and then again after the exercise to see if there has been a change in stress levels.
(Observational and survey research does not always allow us to look at the timing of
these events, which makes understanding causality problematic with these designs.)
3. The cause must be isolated. The researcher must ensure that no outside, perhaps
unknown variables are actually causing the effect we see. The experimental design helps
make this possible. In an experiment, we would make sure that our subjects’ diets were
held constant throughout the exercise program. Otherwise, diet might really be creating
the change in stress level rather than exercise.
A basic experimental design involves beginning with a sample (or subset of a population) and
randomly assigning subjects to one of two groups: the experimental group or the control group.
The experimental group is the group that is going to be exposed to an independent variable or
condition the researcher is introducing as a potential cause of an event. The control group is
going to be used for comparison and is going to have the same experience as the experimental
group but will not be exposed to the independent variable. After exposing the experimental
group to the independent variable, the two groups are measured again to see if a change has
occurred. If so, we are in a better position to suggest that the independent variable caused the
change in the dependent variable.

16 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

The major advantage of the experimental design is that of helping to establish cause and effect
relationships. A disadvantage of this design is the difficulty of translating much of what happens
in a laboratory setting into real life.

Case Studies
Case studies involve exploring a single case or situation in great detail. Information may be
gathered with the use of observation, interviews, testing, or other methods to uncover as much
as possible about a person or situation. Case studies are helpful when investigating unusual
situations such as brain trauma or children reared in isolation. And they are often used by
clinicians who conduct case studies as part of their normal practice when gathering information
about a client or patient coming in for treatment. Case studies can be used to explore areas
about which little is known and can provide rich detail about situations or conditions. However,
the findings from case studies cannot be generalized or applied to larger populations; this is
because cases are not randomly selected and no control group is used for comparison.

Figure 1.7 - Illustrated poster from a classroom describing a case study.12

Surveys
Surveys are familiar to most people because they are so widely used. Surveys enhance
accessibility to subjects because they can be conducted in person, over the phone, through the
mail, or online. A survey involves asking a standard set of questions to a group of subjects. In a
highly structured survey, subjects are forced to choose from a response set such as “strongly
disagree, disagree, undecided, agree, strongly agree”; or “0, 1-5, 6-10, etc.” This is known as
Likert Scale. Surveys are commonly used by sociologists, marketing researchers, political
scientists, therapists, and others to gather information on many independent and dependent
variables in a relatively short period of time. Surveys typically yield surface information on a
wide variety of factors, but may not allow for in-depth understanding of human behavior.

Of course, surveys can be designed in a number of ways. They may include forced choice
questions and semi-structured questions in which the researcher allows the respondent to
describe or give details about certain events. One of the most difficult aspects of designing a
good survey is wording questions in an unbiased way and asking the right questions so that
respondents can give a clear response rather than choosing “undecided” each time. Knowing
that 30% of respondents are undecided is of little use! So a lot of time and effort should be
placed on the construction of survey items. One of the benefits of having forced choice items is
that each response is coded so that the results can be quickly entered and analyzed using
statistical software. Analysis takes much longer when respondents give lengthy responses that
must be analyzed in a different way. Surveys are useful in examining stated values, attitudes,
opinions, and reporting on practices. However, they are based on self-report or what people
say they do rather than on observation and this can limit accuracy.

Developmental Designs
Developmental designs are techniques used in developmental research (and other areas as
well). These techniques try to examine how age, cohort, gender, and social class impact
development.

Longitudinal Research
Longitudinal research involves beginning with a group of people who may be of the same age
and background, and measuring them repeatedly over a long period of time. One of the
benefits of this type of research is that people can be followed through time and be compared
with them when they were younger.

Figure 1.8 – A longitudinal research design.13

A problem with this type of research is that it is very expensive and subjects may drop out over
time. The Perry Preschool Project which began in 1962 is an example of a longitudinal study
that continues to provide data on children’s development.

Cross-sectional Research
Cross-sectional research involves beginning with a sample that represents a cross-section of
the population. Respondents who vary in age, gender, ethnicity, and social class might be asked
to complete a survey about television program preferences or attitudes toward the use of the
Internet. The attitudes of males and females could then be compared, as could attitudes based
on age. In cross-sectional research, respondents are measured only once.

Figure 1.9 – A cross-sectional research design.14

This method is much less expensive than longitudinal research but does not allow the
researcher to distinguish between the impact of age and the cohort effect. Different attitudes
about the use of technology, for example, might not be altered by a person’s biological age as
much as their life experiences as members of a cohort.

Sequential Research
Sequential research involves combining aspects of the previous two techniques; beginning with
a cross-sectional sample and measuring them through time.

Figure 1.10 - A sequential research design.15

This is the perfect model for looking at age, gender, social class, and ethnicity. But the
drawbacks of high costs and attrition are here as well.16

Consent and Ethics in Research
Research should, as much as possible, be based on participants' freely volunteered informed
consent. For minors, this also requires consent from their legal guardians. This implies a
responsibility to explain fully and meaningfully to both the child and their guardians what the
research is about and how it will be disseminated. Participants and their legal guardians should
be aware of the research purpose and procedures, their right to refuse to participate; the
extent to which confidentiality will be maintained; the potential uses to which the data might
be put; the foreseeable risks and expected benefits; and that participants have the right to
discontinue at any time.
But consent alone does not absolve the responsibility of researchers to anticipate and guard
against potential harmful consequences for participants.18 It is critical that researchers protect
all rights of the participants including confidentiality.

Child development is a fascinating field of study – but care must be taken to ensure that
researchers use appropriate methods to examine infant and child behavior, use the correct
experimental design to answer their questions, and be aware of the special challenges that are
part-and-parcel of developmental research. Hopefully, this information helped you develop an
understanding of these various issues and to be ready to think more critically about research
questions that interest you. There are so many interesting questions that remain to be
examined by future generations of developmental scientists – maybe you will make one of the
next big discoveries!19
Another really important framework to use when trying to understand children’s development
are theories of development. Let’s explore what theories are and introduce you to some major
theories in child development.

Developmental Theories
What is a theory?
Students sometimes feel intimidated by theory; even the phrase, “Now we are going to look at
some theories…” is met with blank stares and other indications that the audience is now lost.
But theories are valuable tools for understanding human behavior; in fact they are proposed
explanations for the “how” and “whys” of development. Have you ever wondered, “Why is my
3 year old so inquisitive?” or “Why are some fifth graders rejected by their classmates?”
Theories can help explain these and other occurrences. Developmental theories offer
explanations about how we develop, why we change over time and the kinds of influences that
impact development.
A theory guides and helps us interpret research findings as well. It provides the researcher with
a blueprint or model to be used to help piece together various studies. Think of theories as
guidelines much like directions that come with an appliance or other object that requires
assembly. The instructions can help one piece together smaller parts more easily than if trial
and error are used.
Theories can be developed using induction in which a number of single cases are observed and
after patterns or similarities are noted, the theorist develops ideas based on these examples.
Established theories are then tested through research; however, not all theories are equally
suited to scientific investigation. Some theories are difficult to test but are still useful in
stimulating debate or providing concepts that have practical application. Keep in mind that
theories are not facts; they are guidelines for investigation and practice, and they gain
credibility through research that fails to disprove them.20
Let’s take a look at some key theories in Child Development.

Sigmund Freud’s Psychosexual Theory
We begin with the often controversial figure, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Freud has been a
very influential figure in the area of development; his view of development and
psychopathology dominated the field of psychiatry until the growth of behaviorism in the
1950s. His assumptions that personality forms during the first few years of life and that the
ways in which parents or other caregivers interact with children have a long-lasting impact on
children’s emotional states have guided parents, educators, clinicians, and policy-makers for
many years. We have only recently begun to recognize that early childhood experiences do not
always result in certain personality traits or emotional states. There is a growing body of
literature addressing resilience in children who come from harsh backgrounds and yet develop
without damaging emotional scars (O’Grady and Metz, 1987). Freud has stimulated an
enormous amount of research and generated many ideas. Agreeing with Freud’s theory in its
entirety is hardly necessary for appreciating the contribution he has made to the field of
development.

Figure 1.11 - Sigmund Freud.21

Freud’s theory of self suggests that there are three parts of the self.
The id is the part of the self that is inborn. It responds to biological urges without pause and is
guided by the principle of pleasure: if it feels good, it is the thing to do. A newborn is all id. The
newborn cries when hungry, defecates when the urge strikes.
The ego develops through interaction with others and is guided by logic or the reality principle.
It has the ability to delay gratification. It knows that urges have to be managed. It mediates
between the id and superego using logic and reality to calm the other parts of the self.

The superego represents society’s demands for its members. It is guided by a sense of guilt.
Values, morals, and the conscience are all part of the superego.
The personality is thought to develop in response to the child’s ability to learn to manage
biological urges. Parenting is important here. If the parent is either overly punitive or lax, the
child may not progress to the next stage. Here is a brief introduction to Freud’s stages.

Table 1.2 - Sigmund Freud’s Psychosexual Theory
Name of Stage

Descriptions of Stage

Oral Stage

The oral stage lasts from birth until around age 2. The infant is all id. At this
stage, all stimulation and comfort is focused on the mouth and is based on the
reflex of sucking. Too much indulgence or too little stimulation may lead to
fixation.

Anal Stage

The anal stage coincides with potty training or learning to manage biological
urges. The ego is beginning to develop in this stage. Anal fixation may result in
a person who is compulsively clean and organized or one who is sloppy and
lacks self-control.

Phallic Stage

The phallic stage occurs in early childhood and marks the development of the
superego and a sense of masculinity or femininity as culture dictates.

Latency

Latency occurs during middle childhood when a child’s urges quiet down and
friendships become the focus. The ego and superego can be refined as the child
learns how to cooperate and negotiate with others.

Genital Stage

The genital stage begins with puberty and continues through adulthood. Now
the preoccupation is that of sex and reproduction.

Strengths and Weaknesses of Freud’s Theory
Freud’s theory has been heavily criticized for several reasons. One is that it is very difficult to
test scientifically. How can parenting in infancy be traced to personality in adulthood? Are there
other variables that might better explain development? The theory is also considered to be
sexist in suggesting that women who do not accept an inferior position in society are somehow
psychologically flawed. Freud focuses on the darker side of human nature and suggests that
much of what determines our actions is unknown to us. So why do we study Freud? As
mentioned above, despite the criticisms, Freud’s assumptions about the importance of early
childhood experiences in shaping our psychological selves have found their way into child
development, education, and parenting practices. Freud’s theory has heuristic value in
providing a framework from which to elaborate and modify subsequent theories of

23 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

development. Many later theories, particularly behaviorism and humanism, were challenges to
Freud’s views.22

Main Points to Note About Freud’s Psychosexual Theory
Freud believed that:
 Development in the early years has a lasting impact.
 There are three parts of the self: the id, the ego, and the superego
 People go through five stages of psychosexual development: the oral stage, the anal
stage, the phallic stage, latency, and the genital stage
We study Freud because his assumptions the importance of early childhood experience
provide a framework for later theories (the both elaborated and contradicted/challenged his
work).

Erik Erikson’s Psychosocial Theory
Now, let’s turn to a less controversial theorist, Erik Erikson. Erikson (1902-1994) suggested that
our relationships and society’s expectations motivate much of our behavior in his theory of
psychosocial development. Erikson was a student of Freud’s but emphasized the importance of
the ego, or conscious thought, in determining our actions. In other words, he believed that we
are not driven by unconscious urges. We know what motivates us and we consciously think
about how to achieve our goals. He is considered the father of developmental psychology
because his model gives us a guideline for the entire life span and suggests certain primary
psychological and social concerns throughout life.

Figure 1.12 - Erik Erikson.23

Erikson expanded on his Freud’s by emphasizing the importance of culture in parenting
practices and motivations and adding three stages of adult development (Erikson, 1950; 1968).

24 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

He believed that we are aware of what motivates us throughout life and the ego has greater
importance in guiding our actions than does the id. We make conscious choices in life and these
choices focus on meeting certain social and cultural needs rather than purely biological ones.
Humans are motivated, for instance, by the need to feel that the world is a trustworthy place,
that we are capable individuals, that we can make a contribution to society, and that we have
lived a meaningful life. These are all psychosocial problems.
Erikson divided the lifespan into eight stages. In each stage, we have a major psychosocial task
to accomplish or crisis to overcome. Erikson believed that our personality continues to take
shape throughout our lifespan as we face these challenges in living. Here is a brief overview of
the eight stages:

Table 1.3 - Erik Erikson’s Psychosocial Theory
Name of Stage

Description of Stage

Trust vs. mistrust (0-1)

The infant must have basic needs met in a consistent way in
order to feel that the world is a trustworthy place.

Autonomy vs. shame and
doubt (1-2)

Mobile toddlers have newfound freedom they like to exercise
and by being allowed to do so, they learn some basic
independence.

Initiative vs. Guilt (3-5)

Preschoolers like to initiate activities and emphasize doing
things “all by myself.”

Industry vs. inferiority (611)

School aged children focus on accomplishments and begin
making comparisons between themselves and their classmates

Identity vs. role confusion
(adolescence)

Teenagers are trying to gain a sense of identity as they
experiment with various roles, beliefs, and ideas.

Intimacy vs. Isolation
(young adulthood)

In our 20s and 30s we are making some of our first long-term
commitments in intimate relationships.

Generativity vs. stagnation
(middle adulthood)

The 40s through the early 60s we focus on being productive at
work and home and are motivated by wanting to feel that
we’ve made a contribution to society.

Integrity vs. Despair (late
adulthood)

We look back on our lives and hope to like what we see-that
we have lived well and have a sense of integrity because we
lived according to our beliefs.

25 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

These eight stages form a foundation for discussions on emotional and social development
during the life span. Keep in mind, however, that these stages or crises can occur more than
once. For instance, a person may struggle with a lack of trust beyond infancy under certain
circumstances. Erikson’s theory has been criticized for focusing so heavily on stages and
assuming that the completion of one stage is prerequisite for the next crisis of development.
His theory also focuses on the social expectations that are found in certain cultures, but not in
all. For instance, the idea that adolescence is a time of searching for identity might translate
well in the middle-class culture of the United States, but not as well in cultures where the
transition into adulthood coincides with puberty through rites of passage and where adult roles
offer fewer choices.24

Main Points to Note About Erikson’s Psychosocial Theory
Erikson was a student of Freud but focused on conscious thought.
 His stages of psychosocial development address the entire lifespan and suggest
primary psychosocial crisis in some cultures that adults can use to understand how to
support children’s social and emotional development.
 The stages include: trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame and doubt, initiative vs.
guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation,
generativity vs. stagnation, and integrity vs. despair.

Behaviorism
While Freud and Erikson looked at what was going on in the mind, behaviorism rejected any
reference to mind and viewed overt and observable behavior as the proper subject matter of
psychology. Through the scientific study of behavior, it was hoped that laws of learning could
be derived that would promote the prediction and control of behavior.25

Ivan Pavlov
Ivan Pavlov (1880-1937) was a Russian physiologist interested in studying digestion. As he
recorded the amount of salivation his laboratory dogs produced as they ate, he noticed that
they actually began to salivate before the food arrived as the researcher walked down the hall
and toward the cage. “This,” he thought, “is not natural!” One would expect a dog to
automatically salivate when food hit their palate, but BEFORE the food comes? Of course, what
had happened was . . . you tell me. That’s right! The dogs knew that the food was coming
because they had learned to associate the footsteps with the food. The key word here is
“learned”. A learned response is called a “conditioned” response.

Figure 1.13 - Ivan Pavlov.26

Pavlov began to experiment with this concept of classical conditioning. He began to ring a bell,
for instance, prior to introducing the food. Sure enough, after making this connection several
times, the dogs could be made to salivate to the sound of a bell. Once the bell had become an
event to which the dogs had learned to salivate, it was called a conditioned stimulus. The act of
salivating to a bell was a response that had also been learned, now termed in Pavlov’s jargon, a
conditioned response. Notice that the response, salivation, is the same whether it is
conditioned or unconditioned (unlearned or natural). What changed is the stimulus to which
the dog salivates. One is natural (unconditioned) and one is learned (conditioned).
Let’s think about how classical conditioning is used on us. One of the most widespread
applications of classical conditioning principles was brought to us by the psychologist, John B.
Watson.

John B. Watson
John B. Watson (1878-1958) believed that most of our fears and other emotional responses are
classically conditioned. He had gained a good deal of popularity in the 1920s with his expert
advice on parenting offered to the public.

Figure 1.14 - John B. Watson.27
26
27

He tried to demonstrate the power of classical conditioning with his famous experiment with an
18 month old boy named “Little Albert”. Watson sat Albert down and introduced a variety of
seemingly scary objects to him: a burning piece of newspaper, a white rat, etc. But Albert
remained curious and reached for all of these things. Watson knew that one of our only inborn
fears is the fear of loud noises so he proceeded to make a loud noise each time he introduced
one of Albert’s favorites, a white rat. After hearing the loud noise several times paired with the
rat, Albert soon came to fear the rat and began to cry when it was introduced. Watson filmed
this experiment for posterity and used it to demonstrate that he could help parents achieve any
outcomes they desired, if they would only follow his advice. Watson wrote columns in
newspapers and in magazines and gained a lot of popularity among parents eager to apply
science to household order.
Operant conditioning, on the other hand, looks at the way the consequences of a behavior
increase or decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring again. So let’s look at this a bit more.

B.F. Skinner and Operant Conditioning
B. F. Skinner (1904-1990), who brought us the principles of operant conditioning, suggested
that reinforcement is a more effective means of encouraging a behavior than is criticism or
punishment. By focusing on strengthening desirable behavior, we have a greater impact than if
we emphasize what is undesirable. Reinforcement is anything that an organism desires and is
motivated to obtain.

Figure 1.15 - B. F. Skinner.28

A reinforcer is something that encourages or promotes a behavior. Some things are natural
rewards. They are considered intrinsic or primary because their value is easily understood.
Think of what kinds of things babies or animals such as puppies find rewarding.
Extrinsic or secondary reinforcers are things that have a value not immediately understood.
Their value is indirect. They can be traded in for what is ultimately desired.

28

The use of positive reinforcement involves adding something to a situation in order to
encourage a behavior. For example, if I give a child a cookie for cleaning a room, the addition of
the cookie makes cleaning more likely in the future. Think of ways in which you positively
reinforce others.
Negative reinforcement occurs when taking something unpleasant away from a situation
encourages behavior. For example, I have an alarm clock that makes a very unpleasant, loud
sound when it goes off in the morning. As a result, I get up and turn it off. By removing the
noise, I am reinforced for getting up. How do you negatively reinforce others?
Punishment is an effort to stop a behavior. It means to follow an action with something
unpleasant or painful. Punishment is often less effective than reinforcement for several
reasons. It doesn’t indicate the desired behavior, it may result in suppressing rather than
stopping a behavior, (in other words, the person may not do what is being punished when
you’re around, but may do it often when you leave), and a focus on punishment can result in
not noticing when the person does well.
Not all behaviors are learned through association or reinforcement. Many of the things we do
are learned by watching others. This is addressed in social learning theory.

Social Learning Theory
Albert Bandura (1925-) is a leading contributor to social learning theory. He calls our attention
to the ways in which many of our actions are not learned through conditioning; rather, they are
learned by watching others (1977). Young children frequently learn behaviors through imitation

Figure 1.16 - Albert Bandura.29

Sometimes, particularly when we do not know what else to do, we learn by modeling or
copying the behavior of others. A kindergartner on his or her first day of school might eagerly
look at how others are acting and try to act the same way to fit in more quickly. Adolescents
struggling with their identity rely heavily on their peers to act as role-models. Sometimes we do
things because we’ve seen it pay off for someone else. They were operantly conditioned, but

29

29 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

we engage in the behavior because we hope it will pay off for us as well. This is referred to as
vicarious reinforcement (Bandura, Ross and Ross, 1963).
Bandura (1986) suggests that there is interplay between the environment and the individual.
We are not just the product of our surroundings, rather we influence our surroundings. Parents
not only influence their child’s environment, perhaps intentionally through the use of
reinforcement, etc., but children influence parents as well. Parents may respond differently
with their first child than with their fourth. Perhaps they try to be the perfect parents with their
firstborn, but by the time their last child comes along they have very different expectations
both of themselves and their child. Our environment creates us and we create our
environment.30

Bandura and the Bobo Doll Experiment & Today’s Children and the Media
Other social influences: TV or not TV? Bandura (et als. 1963) began a series of studies to look
at the impact of television, particularly commercials, on the behavior of children. Are children
more likely to act out aggressively when they see this behavior modeled? What if they see it
being reinforced? Bandura began by conducting an experiment in which he showed children
a film of a woman hitting an inflatable clown or “bobo” doll. Then the children were allowed
in the room where they found the doll and immediately began to hit it. This was without any
reinforcement whatsoever. Not only that, but they found new ways to behave aggressively.
It’s as if they learned an aggressive role.
Children view far more television today than in the 1960s; so much, in fact, that they have
been referred to as Generation M (media). The amount of screen time varies by age. As of
2017, children 0-8 spend an average of 2 hours and 19 minutes. Children 8-12 years of age
spend almost 6 hours a day on screen media. And 13- to 18-year-olds spend an average of
just under 9 hours a day in entertainment media use.
The prevalence of violence, sexual content, and messages promoting foods high in fat and
sugar in the media are certainly cause for concern and the subjects of ongoing research and
policy review. Many children spend even more time on the computer viewing content from
the internet. The amount of time spent connected to the internet continues to increase with
the use of smartphones that essentially serve as mini-computers. And the ways children and
adolescents interact with the media continues to change. The popularity of YouTube and the
various social media platforms are examples of this. What might be the implications of this?31

Main Points to Note About Behaviorism
Behaviorists look at observable behavior and how it can be predicted and controlled.
 Pavlov experimented with classical conditioning, the process of conditioning a
response to stimulus (the dog’s salivating to the bell).
 Watson offered advice to parents to show them how classical conditioning can be
used. His most famous experiment was conditioning Little Albert to fear a white rate.
 Skinner believed that reinforcing behavior is the most effective way of increasing
desirable behavior. This is done through operant conditioning.
 Bandura noted that many behaviors are not learned through any type of conditioning,
but rather through imitation. And he believed that people are not only influenced by
their surroundings, but that they also have an impact on their surroundings.
Theories also explore cognitive development and how mental processes change over time.

Jean Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development
Jean Piaget (1896-1980) is one of the most influential cognitive theorists. Piaget was inspired to
explore children’s ability to think and reason by watching his own children’s development. He
was one of the first to recognize and map out the ways in which children’s thought differs from
that of adults. His interest in this area began when he was asked to test the IQ of children and
began to notice that there was a pattern in their wrong answers. He believed that children’s
intellectual skills change over time through maturation. Children of differing ages interpret the
world differently.

Figure 1.17 – Jean Piaget.32

Piaget believed our desire to understand the world comes from a need for cognitive
equilibrium. This is an agreement or balance between what we sense in the outside world and
what we know in our minds. If we experience something that we cannot understand, we try to
restore the balance by either changing our thoughts or by altering the experience to fit into
what we do understand. Perhaps you meet someone who is very different from anyone you
32

31 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

know. How do you make sense of this person? You might use them to establish a new category
of people in your mind or you might think about how they are similar to someone else.
A schema or schemes are categories of knowledge. They are like mental boxes of concepts. A
child has to learn many concepts. They may have a scheme for “under” and “soft” or “running”
and “sour”. All of these are schema. Our efforts to understand the world around us lead us to
develop new schema and to modify old ones.
One way to make sense of new experiences is to focus on how they are similar to what we
already know. This is assimilation. So the person we meet who is very different may be
understood as being “sort of like my brother” or “his voice sounds a lot like yours.” Or a new
food may be assimilated when we determine that it tastes like chicken!
Another way to make sense of the world is to change our mind. We can make a cognitive
accommodation to this new experience by adding new schema. This food is unlike anything I’ve
tasted before. I now have a new category of foods that are bitter-sweet in flavor, for instance.
This is accommodation. Do you accommodate or assimilate more frequently? Children
accommodate more frequently as they build new schema. Adults tend to look for similarity in
their experience and assimilate. They may be less inclined to think “outside the box.”
Piaget suggested different ways of understanding that are associated with maturation. He
divided this into four stages:

Table 1.4 - Jean Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development
Name of Stage
Sensorimotor
Stage

Description of Stage
During the sensorimotor stage children rely on use of the senses and motor
skills. From birth until about age 2, the infant knows by tasting, smelling,
touching, hearing, and moving objects around. This is a real hands on type
of knowledge.

In the preoperational stage, children from ages 2 to 7, become able to
think about the world using symbols. A symbol is something that stands for
something else. The use of language, whether it is in the form of words or
gestures, facilitates knowing and communicating about the world. This is
Preoperational
the hallmark of preoperational intelligence and occurs in early childhood.
Stage
However, these children are preoperational or pre-logical. They still do not
understand how the physical world operates. They may, for instance, fear
that they will go down the drain if they sit at the front of the bathtub, even
though they are too big.

32 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Name of Stage

Description of Stage

Concrete
Operational

Children in the concrete operational stage, ages 7 to 11, develop the ability
to think logically about the physical world. Middle childhood is a time of
understanding concepts such as size, distance, and constancy of matter,
and cause and effect relationships. A child knows that a scrambled egg is
still an egg and that 8 ounces of water is still 8 ounces no matter what
shape of glass contains it.

Formal
Operational

During the formal operational stage children, at about age 12, acquire the
ability to think logically about concrete and abstract events. The teenager
who has reached this stage is able to consider possibilities and to
contemplate ideas about situations that have never been directly
encountered. More abstract understanding of religious ideas or morals or
ethics and abstract principles such as freedom and dignity can be
considered.

Criticisms of Piaget’s Theory
Piaget has been criticized for overemphasizing the role that physical maturation plays in
cognitive development and in underestimating the role that culture and interaction (or
experience) plays in cognitive development. Looking across cultures reveals considerable
variation in what children are able to do at various ages. Piaget may have underestimated what
children are capable of given the right circumstances.33

Main Points To Note About Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development
Piaget, one of the most influential cognitive theorists, believed that
 Understanding is motivated by trying to balance what we sense in the world and what
we know in our minds.
 Understanding is organized through creating categories of knowledge. When
presented with new knowledge we may add new schema or modify existing ones.
Children’s understanding of the world of the world changes are their cognitive skills mature
through 4 stages: sensorimotor stage, preoperational stage, concreate operational stage, and
formal operational stage.

Lev Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory
Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Russian psychologist who wrote in the early 1900s but whose
work was discovered in the United States in the 1960s but became more widely known in the
1980s. Vygotsky differed with Piaget in that he believed that a person not only has a set of

abilities, but also a set of potential abilities that can be realized if given the proper guidance
from others. His sociocultural theory emphasizes the importance of culture and interaction in
the development of cognitive abilities. He believed that through guided participation known as
scaffolding, with a teacher or capable peer, a child can learn cognitive skills within a certain
range known as the zone of proximal development.34 His belief was that development
occurred first through children’s immediate social interactions, and then moved to the
individual level as they began to internalize their learning.35

Figure 1.18- Lev Vygotsky.36

Have you ever taught a child to perform a task? Maybe it was brushing their teeth or preparing
food. Chances are you spoke to them and described what you were doing while you
demonstrated the skill and let them work along with you all through the process. You gave
them assistance when they seemed to need it, but once they knew what to do-you stood back
and let them go. This is scaffolding and can be seen demonstrated throughout the world. This
approach to teaching has also been adopted by educators. Rather than assessing students on
what they are doing, they should be understood in terms of what they are capable of doing
with the proper guidance. You can see how Vygotsky would be very popular with modern day
educators.37

Main Points to Note About Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory
Vygotsky concentrated on the child’s interactions with peers and adults. He believed that the
child was an apprentice, learning through sensitive social interactions with more skilled peers
and adults.

Comparing Piaget and Vygotsky
Vygotsky concentrated more on the child’s immediate social and cultural environment and his
or her interactions with adults and peers. While Piaget saw the child as actively discovering the
world through individual interactions with it, Vygotsky saw the child as more of an apprentice,
learning through a social environment of others who had more experience and were sensitive
to the child’s needs and abilities.38
Like Vygotsky’s, Bronfenbrenner looked at the social influences on learning and development.

Urie Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Model
Urie Bronfenbrenner (1917-2005) offers us one of the most comprehensive theories of human
development. Bronfenbrenner studied Freud, Erikson, Piaget, and learning theorists and
believed that all of those theories could be enhanced by adding the dimension of context. What
is being taught and how society interprets situations depends on who is involved in the life of a
child and on when and where a child lives.

Figure 1.19 - Urie Bronfenbrenner.39

Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems model explains the direct and indirect influences on an
individual’s development.

Description of System
Microsystems impact a child directly. These are the people with whom the
child interacts such as parents, peers, and teachers. The relationship between
individuals and those around them need to be considered. For example, to
appreciate what is going on with a student in math, the relationship between
the student and teacher should be known.

Name of System

Description of System

Mesosystems

Mesosystems are interactions between those surrounding the individual. The
relationship between parents and schools, for example will indirectly affect
the child.

Exosystem

Larger institutions such as the mass media or the healthcare system are
referred to as the exosystem. These have an impact on families and peers and
schools who operate under policies and regulations found in these institutions.

Macrosystems

We find cultural values and beliefs at the level of macrosystems. These larger
ideals and expectations inform institutions that will ultimately impact the
individual.

Chronosystem

All of this happens in an historical context referred to as the chronosystem.
Cultural values change over time, as do policies of educational institutions or
governments in certain political climates. Development occurs at a point in
time.

For example, in order to understand a student in math, we can’t simply look at that individual
and what challenges they face directly with the subject. We have to look at the interactions
that occur between teacher and child. Perhaps the teacher needs to make modifications as
well. The teacher may be responding to regulations made by the school, such as new
expectations for students in math or constraints on time that interfere with the teacher’s ability

science deemed important by political leaders in response to relations with other countries at a
particular time in history.

Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems model challenges us to go beyond the individual if we
want to understand human development and promote improvements.41

Main Points to Note About Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Model
After studying all of the prior theories, Bronfenbrenner added an important element of
context to the discussion of influences on human development.
 He believed that the people involved in children’s lives and when and where they live
are important considerations.
 He created a model of nested systems that influence the child (and are influenced by
the child) that include: microsystems, mesosystems, the exosystem, macrosystems,
and chronosystems.

Development
Chapter Objectives

1. Evaluate roles of nature and nurture in development.
2. Define genes and chromosomes.
3. Differentiate mitosis and meiosis.
4. Explain dominant and recessive patterns on inheritance.
5. List common genetic disorders and chromosomal abnormalities.
6. Describe changes that occur within each of the three periods of prenatal development.
7. Recognize the risks to prenatal development posed by exposure to teratogens.
8. Evaluate different types of prenatal assessment.

Introduction
In this chapter, we will begin by examining some of the ways in which heredity helps to shape
the way we are. We will look at what happens genetically during conception, and describe
some known genetic and chromosomal disorders. Next we will consider what happens during
prenatal development, including the impact of teratogens. We will also discuss the impact that
both the mother and father have on the developing fetus.1

Heredity
Nature and Nurture
Most scholars agree that there is a constant interplay between nature (heredity) and nurture
(the environment). It is difficult to isolate the root of any single characteristic as a result solely
of nature or nurture, and most scholars believe that even determining the extent to which
nature or nurture impacts a human feature is difficult to answer. In fact, almost all human
features are polygenic (a result of many genes) and multifactorial (a result of many factors,
both genetic and environmental). It’s as if one’s genetic make-up sets up a range of
possibilities, which may or may not be realized depending upon one’s environmental
experiences. For instance, a person might be genetically predisposed to develop diabetes, but
the person’s lifestyle may determine whether or not they actually develop the disease.
This bidirectional interplay between nature and nurture is the epigenetic framework, which
suggests that the environment can affect the expression of genes just as genetic predispositions

can impact a person’s potentials. And environmental circumstances can trigger symptoms of a
genetic disorder.2

Environment Correlations
Environment Correlations refer to the processes by which genetic factors contribute to
variations in the environment (Plomin, DeFries, Knopik, & Neiderhiser, 2013). There are three
types of genotype-environment correlations:
Passive genotype-environment correlation occurs when children passively inherit the genes
and the environments their family provides. Certain behavioral characteristics, such as being
athletically inclined, may run in families. The children have inherited both the genes that would
enable success at these activities, and given the environmental encouragement to engage in
these actions.

Figure 2.1 – Two skiers.3

Evocative genotype-environment correlation refers to how the social environment reacts to
individuals based on their inherited characteristics. For example, whether one has a more
outgoing or shy temperament will affect how he or she is treated by others.
Active genotype-environment correlation occurs when individuals seek out environments that
support their genetic tendencies. This is also referred to as niche picking. For example, children
who are musically inclined seek out music instruction and opportunities that facilitate their
natural musical ability.
Conversely, Genotype-Environment Interactions involve genetic susceptibility to the
environment. Adoption studies provide evidence for genotype-environment interactions. For
example, the Early Growth and Development Study (Leve, Neiderhiser, Scaramella, & Reiss,

2010) followed 360 adopted children and their adopted and biological parents in a longitudinal
study. Results have shown that children whose biological parents exhibited psychopathology,
exhibited significantly fewer behavior problems when their adoptive parents used more
structured parenting than unstructured. Additionally, elevated psychopathology in adoptive
parents increased the risk for the children’s development of behavior problems, but only when
the biological parents’ psychopathology was high. Consequently, the results show how
environmental effects on behavior differ based on the genotype, especially stressful
environments on genetically at-risk children.4

Genes and Chromosomes
Now, let’s look more closely at just nature. Nature refers to the contribution of genetics to
one’s development. The basic building block of the nature perspective is the gene. Genes are
recipes for making proteins, while proteins influence the structure and functions of cells. Genes
are located on the chromosomes and there are an estimated 20,500 genes for humans,
according to the Human Genome Project (NIH, 2015).

Figure 2.2 – DNA’s location in the cell.5

Normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes (or 23 pairs; one from each parent) in the nucleus
of the cells. After conception, most cells of the body are created by a process called mitosis.
Mitosis is defined as the cell’s nucleus making an exact copy of all the chromosomes and
splitting into two new cells.
However, the cells used in sexual reproduction, called the gametes (sperm or ova), are formed
in a process called meiosis. In meiosis, the gamete’s chromosomes duplicate, and then divide
twice resulting in four cells containing only half the genetic material of the original gamete.
Thus, each sperm and egg possesses only 23 chromosomes and combine to produce the normal
46.

Of the 23 pairs of chromosomes created at conception, 22 pairs are similar in length. These are
called autosomes. The remaining pair, or sex chromosomes, may differ in length. If a child
receives the combination of XY, the child will be genetically male. If the child receives the
combination XX, the child will be genetically female.8
Here is an image (called a karyogram) of what the 23 pairs of chromosomes look like. Notice the
differences between the sex chromosomes in female (XX) and male (XY).

Figure 2.4 – The 23 pairs of chromosomes.9

Genotypes and Phenotypes & Patterns on Inheritance
The word genotype refers to the sum total of all the genes a person inherits. The word
phenotype refers to the features that are actually expressed. Look in the mirror. What do you
see, your genotype or your phenotype? What determines whether or not genes are expressed?
Because genes are inherited in pairs on the chromosomes, we may receive either the same
version of a gene from our mother and father, that is, be homozygous for that characteristic
the gene influences. If we receive a different version of the gene from each parent, that is
referred to as heterozygous.
In the homozygous situation we will display that characteristic. It is in the heterozygous
condition that it becomes clear that not all genes are created equal. Some genes are dominant,
meaning they express themselves in the phenotype even when paired with a different version
of the gene, while their silent partner is called recessive. Recessive genes express themselves
only when paired with a similar version gene. Geneticists refer to different versions of a gene as
alleles. Some dominant traits include having facial dimples, curly hair, normal vision, and dark
hair. Some recessive traits include red hair, being nearsighted, and straight hair.

Most characteristics are not the result of a single gene; they are polygenic, meaning they are
the result of several genes. In addition, the dominant and recessive patterns described above
are usually not that simple either. Sometimes the dominant gene does not completely suppress
the recessive gene; this is called incomplete dominance.10

Genetic Disorders
Most of the known genetic disorders are dominant gene-linked; however, the vast majority of
dominant gene linked disorders are not serious or debilitating. For example, the majority of
those with Tourette's Syndrome suffer only minor tics from time to time and can easily control
their symptoms. When dominant-gene linked diseases are serious, they do not tend to become
symptomatic until later in life. Huntington's Disease is a dominant gene linked disorder that
affects the nervous system and is fatal, but does not appear until midlife.
Recessive gene disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia, are less common but
may actually claim more lives because they are less likely to be detected as people are unaware
that they are carriers of the disease.
Some genetic disorders are sex-linked; the defective gene is found on the X-chromosome.
Males have only one X chromosome so are at greater risk for sex-linked disorders due to a
recessive gene such as hemophilia, color-blindness, and baldness. For females to be affected by
recessive genetic defects, they need to inherit the recessive gene on both X-chromosomes. But
if the defective gene is dominant, females are equally at risk.
Here are tables of some genetic disorders:
Recessive Disorders (Homozygous): The individual inherits a gene change from both parents. If
the gene is inherited from just one parent, the person is a carrier and does not have the
condition.

a protein it needs for the brain to grow and
problems with learning and behavior can
occur. Fragile X syndrome is caused from an
abnormality in the X chromosome, which then
breaks. If a female has a fragile X, her second X
chromosome usually is healthy, but males with
fragile X don’t have a second healthy X
chromosome. This is why symptoms of Fragile
X usually are more serious in males.
Occurs when there are problems in blood
clotting causing both internal and external
bleeding.
A weakening of the muscles resulting in an
inability to move, wasting away, and possible
death.

Chromosomal Abnormalities: A chromosomal abnormality occurs when a child inherits too
many or two few chromosomes. The most common cause of chromosomal abnormalities is the
age of the mother. As the mother ages, the ovum is more likely to suffer abnormalities due to
longer term exposure to environmental factors. Consequently, some gametes do not divide
evenly when they are forming. Therefore, some cells have more than 46 chromosomes. In fact,

it is believed that close to half of all zygotes have an odd number of chromosomes. Most of
these zygotes fail to develop and are spontaneously aborted by the mother’s body.14

Description

XYY Syndrome

Caused when an extra Y chromosome is present in the cells of a male.
There are few symptoms. They may include being taller than average,
acne, and an increased risk of learning problems. The person is
generally otherwise normal, including normal fertility.

Triple X Syndrome
(XXX)

Caused when an extra X chromosome is present in the cells of a
female. It may result in being taller than average, learning difficulties,
decreased muscle tone, seizures, and kidney problems.

Prenatal Development
Now we turn our attention to prenatal development which is divided into three periods: The
germinal period, the embryonic period, and the fetal period. The following is an overview of
some of the changes that take place during each period.

The Germinal Period
The germinal period (about 14 days in length) lasts from conception to implantation of the
fertilized egg in the lining of the uterus. At ejaculation millions of sperm are released into the
vagina, but only a few reach the egg and typically only one fertilizes the egg. Once a single
sperm has entered the wall of the egg, the wall becomes hard and prevents other sperm from
entering. After the sperm has entered the egg, the tail of the sperm breaks off and the head of
the sperm, containing the genetic information from the father, unites with the nucleus of the
egg. It is typically fertilized in the top section of the fallopian tube and continues its journey to
the uterus. As a result, a new cell is formed. This cell, containing the combined genetic
information from both parents, is referred to as a zygote.

Figure 2.7 - Sperm and ovum at conception.20

During this time, the organism begins cell division through mitosis. After five days of mitosis
there are 100 cells, which is now called a blastocyst. The blastocyst consists of both an inner
and outer group of cells. The inner group of cells, or embryonic disk will become the embryo,
while the outer group of cells, or trophoblast, becomes the support system which nourishes the

20

49 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

developing organism. This stage ends when the blastocyst fully implants into the uterine wall
(U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2015).

Figure 2.8 – The cycle of fertilization.21

Mitosis is a fragile process and fewer than one half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two
weeks (Hall, 2004). Some of the reasons for this include: the egg and sperm do not join
properly, thus their genetic material does not combine, there is too little or damaged genetic
material, the zygote does not replicate, or the blastocyst does not implant into the uterine wall.
The failure rate is higher for in vitro conceptions. The figure below illustrates the journey of the
ova from its release to its fertilization, cell duplication, and implantation into the uterine
lining.22

The Embryonic Period
Starting the third week, the blastocyst has implanted in the uterine wall. Upon implantation this
multi-cellular organism is called an embryo. Now blood vessels grow forming the placenta. The
placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from the
mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord.
During this period, cells continue to differentiate. Growth during prenatal development occurs
in two major directions: from head to tail called cephalocaudal development and from the
midline outward referred to as proximodistal development. This means that those structures
nearest the head develop before those nearest the feet and those structures nearest the torso

develop before those away from the center of the body (such as hands and fingers). You will
see that this pattern continues after birth.
The head develops in the fourth week and the precursor to the heart begins to pulse. In the
early stages of the embryonic period, gills and a tail are apparent. However, by the end of this
stage they disappear and the organism takes on a more human appearance.

Figure 2.9 – A human embryo.23

About 20 percent of organisms fail during the embryonic period, usually due to gross
chromosomal abnormalities, often before the mother even knows that she is pregnant. It is
during this stage that the major structures of the body are taking form, making the embryonic
period the time when the organism is most vulnerable to the greatest amount of damage if
exposed to harmful substances. Prospective mothers are not often aware of the risks they
introduce to the developing embryo during this time. The embryo is approximately 1 inch in
length and weighs about 4 grams at the end of eight weeks. The embryo can move and respond
to touch at this time.24

The Fetal Period
From the ninth week until birth (which is forty weeks for a full-term pregnancy), the organism is
referred to as a fetus. During this stage, the major structures are continuing to develop. By the
third month, the fetus has all its body parts including external genitalia. The fetus is about 3
inches long and weighs about 28 grams. In the following weeks, the fetus will develop hair,
nails, teeth and the excretory and digestive systems will continue to develop.

Figure 2.10 – A human fetus.25

During the 4th - 6th months, the eyes become more sensitive to light and hearing develops. The
respiratory system continues to develop, and reflexes such as sucking, swallowing and
hiccupping, develop during the 5th month. Cycles of sleep and wakefulness are present at this
time as well. The first chance of survival outside the womb, known as the age of viability is
reached at about 24 weeks (Morgan, Goldenberg, & Schulkin, 2008). Many practitioners
hesitate to resuscitate before 24 weeks. The majority of the neurons in the brain have
developed by 24 weeks, although they are still rudimentary, and the glial or nurse cells that
support neurons continue to grow. At 24 weeks the fetus can feel pain (Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1997).
Between the 7th - 9th months, the fetus is primarily preparing for birth. It is exercising its
muscles and its lungs begin to expand and contract. The fetus gains about 5 pounds and 7
inches during this last trimester of pregnancy, and during the 8th month a layer of fat develops
under the skin. This layer of fat serves as insulation and helps the baby regulate body
temperature after birth.
At around 36 weeks the fetus is almost ready for birth. It weighs about 6 pounds and is about
18.5 inches long. By week 37 all of the fetus’s organ systems are developed enough that it could
survive outside the mother’s uterus without many of the risks associated with premature birth.
The fetus continues to gain weight and grow in length until approximately 40 weeks. By then
the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent. The progression
through the stages is shown in the following figure.26

Monozygotic and Dizygotic Twins
Monozygotic or identical twins occur when a fertilized egg splits apart in the first two weeks
of development. The result is the creation of two separate, but genetically identical offspring.
That is, they possess the same genotype and often the same phenotype. About one-third of
twins are monozygotic twins.
Sometimes, however, two eggs or ova are released and fertilized by two separate sperm. The
result is dizygotic or fraternal twins. These two individuals share the same amount of genetic
material as would any two children from the same mother and father. In other words, they
possess a different genotype and phenotype.
Older mothers are more likely to have dizygotic twins than are younger mothers, and couples
who use fertility drugs are also more likely to give birth to dizygotic twins.28

Teratogens
Good prenatal care is essential to protect against maternal and fetal/infant mortality and birth
complications. The embryo and fetus is most at risk for some of the most severe problems
during the first three months of development. Unfortunately, this is a time at which many
mothers are unaware that they are pregnant. Today, we know many of the factors that can
jeopardize the health of the developing child. The study of factors that contribute to birth
defects is called teratology. Teratogens are environmental factors that can contribute to birth
defects, and include some maternal diseases, pollutants, drugs and alcohol.

Factors influencing prenatal risks: There are several considerations in determining the type and
amount of damage that might result from exposure to a particular teratogen (Berger, 2005).
These include:
 The timing of the exposure: Structures in the body are vulnerable to the most severe
damage when they are forming. If a substance is introduced during a particular
structure's critical period (time of development), the damage to that structure may be
greater. For example, the ears and arms reach their critical periods at about 6 weeks
after conception. If a mother exposes the embryo to certain substances during this
period, the arms and ears may be malformed. (see figure below)
 The amount of exposure: Some substances are not harmful unless the amounts reach a
certain level. The critical level depends in part on the size and metabolism of the
mother.
 The number of teratogens: Fetuses exposed to multiple teratogens typically have more
problems than those exposed to only one.
 Genetics: Genetic makeup also plays a role on the impact a particular teratogen might
have on the child. This is suggested by fraternal twins exposed to the same prenatal
environment, but they do not experience the same teratogenic effects. The genetic
makeup of the mother can also have an effect; some mothers may be more resistant to
teratogenic effects than others.
 Being male or female: Males are more likely to experience damage due to teratogens
than are females. It is believed that the Y chromosome, which contains fewer genes
than the X, may have an impact.31

There are four categories of teratogens:
1. Physical teratogens: These could be saunas, hot tubs, or infections that raise a pregnant
woman's body temperature to 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. This is associated with
neural tube defects, spontaneous abortions, and various cardiovascular abnormalities.
2. Metabolic conditions affecting pregnant females: Metabolic conditions are
abnormalities in the chemical process of producing energy from food, and thereby
affect the development and function of the body. If a pregnant woman is malnourished,
then her fetus likely lacks the nutrients essential for its development. These include:
malnutrition, diabetes, and thyroid disorders.
3. Infections: Different maternal infections, including rubella virus, herpes simplex virus,
and syphilis can cause congenital abnormalities in fetuses.
4. Drugs and chemicals: When pregnant females ingest or absorb these, they may cause a
variety of different effects based on specific agent, amount of exposure, and timing. This
category includes: radiation, heavy metals (including lead), insecticides and herbicides,
prescription and over the counter drugs, illicit and recreational drugs, alcohol,
cigarettes, nicotine, caffeine, and even some vitamins.33
While there are many, many potential teratogens, the following tables look at the effects of
some different types of teratogens. The risks of exposure vary based on lifestyle and health.
The effects may vary greatly depending on the factors mentioned previously. Protection and
prevention will vary based on the method of exposure.

Potential Effects

Caffeine

Moderate amounts of caffeine (200 mg or around 12 ounces of coffee)
appear to be safe during pregnancy. Some studies have shown a link
between higher amounts of caffeine and miscarriage and preterm birth.34

Tobacco

Tobacco use has been associated with low birth weight, placenta previa,
preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, sudden infant death syndrome,
cleft lip or palate, and later health problems (such as high blood pressure
and diabetes).35

Alcohol

There is no safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink while pregnant.
Alcohol can slow down the baby's growth, affect the baby's brain, and
cause birth defects, and may results in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
(FASD). The effects can be mild to severe. Children born with a severe

Cocaine

Cocaine use has connected with low birth weight, stillbirths, spontaneous
abortion, placental abruption, premature birth, miscarriage, and neonatal
abstinence syndrome (fetal addiction leads the newborn to experiences
withdrawal).37

Marijuana

No amount of marijuana has been proven safe to use during pregnancy.
Heavy use has been associated with brain damage, premature birth, and
stillbirth.38

Heroin

Using heroin during pregnancy can cause birth defects, placental
abruption, premature birth, low birthweight, neonatal abstinence
syndrome, still birth, and sudden infant death syndrome.39

Over-theCounter (OTC)
medication

Some OTC medications are safe to use during pregnancy and others may
cause health problems during pregnancy. Pregnant women should consult
their health care provider before using OTC medications.40

Prescription
drugs

Some prescription drugs can cause birth defects that change the shape or
function of one or more parts of the body that can affect overall health.
Pregnant women should consult their health care provider before
discontinuing or starting new medications.41

Maternal Factors
There are additional factors that affect the outcome of pregnancy for both mother and child.
Let’s look at these next.

Mothers over 35
Most women over 35 who become pregnant are in good health and have healthy pregnancies.
However, according to the March of Dimes (2016d), women over age 35 are more likely to have
an increased risk of:
 Fertility problems
 High blood pressure
 Diabetes
 Miscarriages
 Placenta Previa
 Cesarean section
 Premature birth
 Stillbirth
 A baby with a genetic disorder or other birth defects

Because a woman is born with all her eggs, environmental teratogens can affect the quality of
the eggs as women get older. Also, a woman’s reproductive system ages which can adversely
affect the pregnancy. Some women over 35 choose special prenatal screening tests, such as a
maternal blood screening, to determine if there are any health risks for the baby.
Although there are medical concerns associated with having a child later in life, there are also
many positive consequences to being a more mature parent. Older parents are more confident,
less stressed, and typically married, providing family stability. Their children perform better on
math and reading tests, and they are less prone to injuries or emotional troubles (Albert, 2013).
Women who choose to wait are often well educated and lead healthy lives. According to
Gregory (2007), older women are more stable, demonstrate a stronger family focus, possess
greater self-confidence, and have more money. Having a child later in one’s career equals
overall higher wages. In fact, for every year a woman delays motherhood, she makes 9% more
in lifetime earnings. Lastly, women who delay having children actually live longer.

Teenage Pregnancy
A teenage mother is at a greater risk for having pregnancy complications including anemia, and
high blood pressure. These risks are even greater for those under age 15. Infants born to
teenage mothers have a higher risk for being premature and having low birthweight or other
serious health problems. Premature and low birthweight babies may have organs that are not
fully developed which can result in breathing problems, bleeding in the brain, vision loss,
serious intestinal problems, and higher likelihood of dying. Reasons for these health issues
include that teenagers are the least likely of all age groups to get early and regular prenatal care
and they may engage in negative behaviors including eating unhealthy food, smoking, drinking
alcohol, and taking drugs.

Gestational Diabetes
Seven percent of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes (March of Dimes, 2015b).
Diabetes is a condition where the body has too much glucose in the bloodstream.

Figure 2.16 – A gestational diabetes kit.55

61 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Most pregnant women have their glucose level tested between 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the mother gives birth, but it might indicate a risk
for developing diabetes later in life. If untreated, gestational diabetes can cause premature
birth, stillbirth, the baby having breathing problems at birth, jaundice, or low blood sugar.
Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes can also be considerably heavier (more than 9
pounds) making the labor and birth process more difficult. For expectant mothers, untreated
gestational diabetes can cause preeclampsia (high blood pressure and signs that the liver and
kidneys may not be working properly) discussed later in the chapter.
Risk factors for gestational diabetes include age (being over age 25), being overweight or
gaining too much weight during pregnancy, family history of diabetes, having had gestational
diabetes with a prior pregnancy, and race and ethnicity (African-American, Native American,
Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific Islander have a higher risk). Eating healthy and maintaining a healthy
weight during pregnancy can reduce the chance of gestational diabetes. Women who already
have diabetes and become pregnant need to attend all their prenatal care visits, and follow the
same advice as those for women with gestational diabetes as the risk of preeclampsia,
premature birth, birth defects, and stillbirth are the same.

High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)
Hypertension is a condition in which the pressure against the wall of the arteries becomes too
high. There are two types of high blood pressure during pregnancy, gestational and chronic.
Gestational hypertension only occurs during pregnancy and goes away after birth. Chronic high
blood pressure refers to women who already had hypertension before the pregnancy or to
those who developed it during pregnancy and it did not go away after birth.

Figure 2.17 – A woman having her blood pressure taken. 56

According to the March of Dimes (2015c), about 8 in every 100 pregnant women have high
blood pressure. High blood pressure during pregnancy can cause premature birth and low birth
weight (under five and a half pounds), placental abruption, and mothers can develop
preeclampsia.

Rh Disease
Rh is a protein found in the blood. Most people are Rh positive, meaning they have this protein.
Some people are Rh negative, meaning this protein is absent. Mothers who are Rh negative are
at risk of having a baby with a form of anemia called Rh disease (March of Dimes, 2009). A
father who is Rh-positive and mother who is Rh-negative can conceive a baby who is Rhpositive. Some of the fetus’s blood cells may get into the mother’s bloodstream and her
immune system is unable to recognize the Rh factor.
The immune system starts to produce antibodies to fight off what it thinks is a foreign invader.
Once her body produces immunity, the antibodies can cross the placenta and start to destroy
the red blood cells of the developing fetus. As this process takes time, often the first Rh positive
baby is not harmed, but as the mother’s body will continue to produce antibodies to the Rh
factor across her lifetime, subsequent pregnancies can pose greater risk for an Rh positive baby.
In the newborn, Rh disease can lead to jaundice, anemia, heart failure, brain damage and
death.

Weight Gain during Pregnancy
According to March of Dimes (2016f), during pregnancy most women need only an additional
300 calories per day to aid in the growth of the fetus. Gaining too little or too much weight
during pregnancy can be harmful. Women who gain too little may have a baby who is low-birth
weight, while those who gain too much are likely to have a premature or large baby. There is
also a greater risk for the mother developing preeclampsia and diabetes, which can cause
further problems during the pregnancy.
The table below shows the healthy weight gain during pregnancy. Putting on the weight slowly
is best. Mothers who are concerned about their weight gain should talk to their health care
provider.

Stress
Feeling stressed is common during pregnancy, but high levels of stress can cause complications
including having a premature baby or a low-birthweight baby. Babies born early or too small are
at an increased risk for health problems. Stress-related hormones may cause these
complications by affecting a woman’s immune systems resulting in an infection and premature
birth. Additionally, some women deal with stress by smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking drugs,
which can lead to problems in the pregnancy. High levels of stress in pregnancy have also been
correlated with problems in the baby’s brain development and immune system functioning, as
well as childhood problems such as trouble paying attention and being afraid (March of Dimes,
2012b).

Depression
Depression is a significant medical condition in which feelings of sadness, worthlessness, guilt,
and fatigue interfere with one’s daily functioning. Depression can occur before, during, or after
pregnancy, and 1 in 7 women are treated for depression sometime between the year before
pregnancy and year after pregnancy (March of Dimes, 2015a). Women who have experienced
depression previously are more likely to have depression during pregnancy. Consequences of
depression include the baby being born premature, having a low birthweight, being more
irritable, less active, less attentive, and having fewer facial expressions.
About 13% of pregnant women take an antidepressant during pregnancy. It is important that
women taking antidepressants during pregnancy discuss the medication with a health care
provider as some medications can cause harm to the developing organism.

Paternal Impact
The age of fathers at the time of conception is also an important factor in health risks for
children. According to Nippoldt (2015), offspring of men over 40 face an increased risk of
miscarriages, autism, birth defects, achondroplasia (bone growth disorder) and schizophrenia.
These increased health risks are thought to be due to accumulated chromosomal aberrations
and mutations during the maturation of sperm cells in older men (Bray, Gunnell, & Smith,
2006). However, like older women, the overall risks are small.
In addition, men are more likely than women to work in occupations where hazardous
chemicals, many of which have teratogenic effects or may cause genetic mutations, are used
(Cordier, 2008). These may include petrochemicals, lead, and pesticides that can cause
abnormal sperm and lead to miscarriages or diseases. Men are also more likely to be a source
of second hand smoke for their developing offspring. As noted earlier, smoking by either the
mother or around the mother can hinder prenatal development.57

Figure 2.18 – A USDA employee pouring hazardous chemicals into a storage container. 58

Prenatal Assessment
A number of assessments are suggested to women as part of their routine prenatal care to find
conditions that may increase the risk of complications for the mother and fetus (Eisenberg,
Murkoff, & Hathaway, 1996). These can include blood and urine analyses and screening and
diagnostic tests for birth defects.

Figure 2.19 – A woman receiving an ultrasound.59

Ultrasound is one of the main screening tests done in combination with blood tests. The
ultrasound is a test in which sound waves are used to examine the fetus. There are two general
types. Transvaginal ultrasounds are used in early pregnancy, while transabdominal ultrasounds
are more common and used after 10 weeks of pregnancy (typically, 16 to 20 weeks).
Ultrasounds are used to check the fetus for defects or problems. It can also find out the age of
the fetus, location of the placenta, fetal position, movement, breathing and heart rate, amount
of amniotic fluid in the uterus, and number of fetuses. Most women have at least one

ultrasound during pregnancy, but if problems are noted, additional ultrasounds may be
recommended.
When diagnosis of a birth defect is necessary, ultrasounds help guide the more invasive
diagnostic tests of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. Amniocentesis is a procedure in
which a needle is used to withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid and cells from the sac
surrounding the fetus and later tested.

Figure 2.20 – Amniocentesis.60

Chorionic Villus Sampling is a procedure in which a small sample of cells is taken from the
placenta and tested. Both amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling have a risk of
miscarriage, and consequently they are not done routinely.61

Complications of Pregnancy
There are a number of common side effects of pregnancy. Not everyone experiences all of
these, nor to the same degree. And although they are considered "minor", this is not to say that
these problems are not potentially very uncomfortable. These side effects include nausea
(particularly during the first 3-4 months of pregnancy as a result of higher levels of estrogen in
the system), heartburn, gas, hemorrhoids, backache, leg cramps, insomnia, constipation,
shortness of breath or varicose veins (as a result of carrying a heavy load on the abdomen).
These are minor issues.

But there are also serious complications of pregnancy which can pose health risks to mother
and child and that often require hospitalization.
Hyperemesis gravidarum is characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and possibly
dehydration. Signs and symptoms may also include vomiting many times a day and feeling faint.
The exact causes of hyperemesis gravidarum are unknown. Risk factors include the first
pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, obesity, prior or family history of HG, trophoblastic disorder,
and a history of eating disorders. Treatment includes drinking fluids and a bland diet.
Medication, intravenous fluids, and hospitalization may be required. Hyperemesis gravidarum is
estimated to affect 0.3–2.0% of pregnant women. Those affected have a low risk of miscarriage
but a higher risk of premature birth.
Ectopic Pregnancy occurs when the zygote becomes attached to the fallopian tube before
reaching the uterus. About 1 in 50 pregnancies in the United States are tubal pregnancies and
this number has been increasing because of the higher rates of pelvic inflammatory disease and
Chlamydia (Carroll, 2007). Abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea and fainting are symptoms
of ectopic pregnancy.

Figure 2.21 – An ectopic pregnancy.62

Spontaneous abortion is experienced in an estimated 20-40 percent of undiagnosed
pregnancies and in another 10 percent of diagnosed pregnancies. Usually the body aborts due
to chromosomal abnormalities, and this typically happens before the 12th week of pregnancy.
Cramping and bleeding result and normal periods return after several months. Some women
are more likely to have repeated miscarriages due to chromosomal, amniotic, or hormonal
problems, but miscarriage can also be a result of defective sperm (Carrell et. al., 2003).
Preeclampsia, also known as Toxemia, is characterized by a sharp rise in blood pressure, a
leakage of protein into the urine as a result of kidney problems, and swelling of the hands, feet,
62

and face during the third trimester of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is the most common
complication of pregnancy. When preeclampsia causes seizures, the condition is known as
eclampsia, which is the second leading cause of maternal death in the United States.
Preeclampsia is also a leading cause of fetal complications, which include low birth weight,
premature birth, and stillbirth. Treatment is typically bed rest and sometimes medication. If this
treatment is ineffective, labor may be induced.
Maternal Mortality: Approximately 1000 women die in childbirth around the world each day
(World Health Organization, 2010). Rates are highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia,
although there has been a substantial decrease in these rates. The campaign to make childbirth
safe for everyone has led to the development of clinics accessible to those living in more
isolated areas and training more midwives to assist in childbirth.63

Infertility and Building Families
Infertility
When a couple has failed to conceive a child in a year, they receive the diagnosis of infertility.
Infertility affects about 10 to 15 percent of couples in the United States (Mayo Clinic, 2015).
Male factors create infertility in about a third of the cases. For men, the most common cause
is a lack of sperm production or low sperm production.
Female factors cause infertility in another third of cases. For women, one of the most
common causes of infertility is the failure to ovulate. Another cause of infertility in women is
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), which is an infection of a woman’s reproductive organs
(Carroll, 2007).
Both male and female factors contribute to the remainder of cases of infertility.64

Options for Building Families
There are numerous options to pursue parenthood and building families. Let’s briefly explore
some of these.
Assisted Reproductive Technology
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is the technology used to achieve pregnancy in
procedures such as fertility medication (to stimulate ovulation), surgical procedures, artificial
insemination IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and surrogacy. These options are available for

Infertility and Building Families
people who are experiencing infertility or cannot conceive children naturally (which also
includes single parents, and gay/lesbian couples).65
Intrauterine insemination: (IUI) as a type of artificial insemination involves the placement of
sperm directly into the uterus at the time of ovulation, either in a natural menstrual cycle or
following ovarian stimulation.66
In vitro fertilization (IVF): IVF generally starts with stimulating the ovaries to increase egg
production. Most fertility medications are agents that stimulate the development of follicles
in the ovary. Examples are gonadotropins and gonadotropin releasing hormone. After
stimulation, the physician surgically extracts one or more eggs from the ovary, and unites
them with sperm in a laboratory setting, with the intent of producing one or more embryos.
Fertilization takes place outside the body, and the fertilized egg is reinserted into the
woman's reproductive tract, in a procedure called embryo transfer.67

Figure 2.22 – The IVF process.68

Donor Gametes & Embryos: People can also use sperm, ova (eggs), and embryos from
donors in conjunction with ART. These donations take place through agencies and donor
banks or between private individuals. In the U.S., donors can be compensated for their
donations.
Surrogacy: In surrogacy, one woman (surrogate mother) carries a child for another person/s
(commissioning person/couple), based on a legal agreement before conception requiring the
child to be relinquished to the commissioning person/couple following birth. There are
different types of surrogacy which relate to whether or not the ova used to conceive the child
are her own (traditional surrogacy) or not (gestational surrogacy).69

Infertility and Building Families
Adoption: People can also choose to pursue adoption to build their families (with or without
experiencing infertility). Adoption can take place through the foster care system, privately, or
through agencies. Adoptions can be domestic (within the U.S.) or international. And they can
be open (with differing amounts of contact between biological/birth families and adoptive
families) or closed.

Chapter 3: Birth and the Newborn
Chapter Objectives
After this chapter, you should be able to:
 Compare and contrast different methods of childbirth preparation.
 Describe the stages of vaginal delivery.
 Explain why induction or Caesarean section may be necessary.
 Differentiate the common procedures for assessing the condition of the newborn.
 Examine problems newborns experience before, during, and after birth.

Introduction
After around 266 days of developing inside the womb (for a full-term pregnancy), comes the
arduous process of childbirth. After birth, newborns have to regulate their own body
temperature, breathe for themselves, and take in all of their nutrition through feeding. Let’s
look at both the process of birth and some attributes of the newborn.

Preparing for Childbirth
Prepared childbirth refers to being not only in good physical condition to help provide a healthy
environment for the baby to develop, but also helping individuals to prepare to accept their
new roles as parents. Additionally, parents can receive information and training that will assist
them for delivery and life with the baby. The more future parents can learn about childbirth
and the newborn, the better prepared they will be for the adjustment they must make to a new
life.

Approaches to Childbirth
There are many different approaches to childbirth that influence how expectant parents
prepare. The following table describes a few of these:

Table 3.1 - Approaches to Childbirth1
Method

The Lamaze Method

Description
The emphasis of this method is on teaching the woman to be in
control in the process of delivery. It includes learning muscle
relaxation, breathing through contractions, having a focal point
(usually a picture to look at) during contractions and having a
support person who goes through the training process with the
mother and serves as a coach during delivery.

Method
The Leboyer Method

Dick-Read Method /
Mongan Method /
Hypnobirthing

Bradley Method

Alexander Technique

Waterbirth

Lotus Birth

Silent Birth

Description
This method involves giving birth in a quiet, dimly lit room and
allowing the newborn to lie on the mother’s stomach with the
umbilical cord intact for several minutes while being given a warm
bath.
This method comes from the suggestion that the fear of childbirth
increases tension and makes the process of childbearing more
painful. It emphasizes the use of relaxation and proper breathing
with contractions as well as family support and education.
“The Bradley Method focuses on preparing the mother for a natural
childbirth coached by her partner. They learn techniques to reduce
the perception of pain and stay relaxed. The emphasis is on being
prepared for an unassisted vaginal birth without medication.”2
This is a technique that can be used during childbirth that involves
training to stop habitual reactions to pain, such as tensing muscles
and increase conscious awareness and control over posture and
movement. This involves being able to move freely and stay upright
during labor and using body positioning that is beneficial to the labor
process.3
Involves immersion in warm water. Proponents believe this method
is safe and provides many benefits for both mother and infant,
including pain relief and a less traumatic birth experience for the
baby. However, critics argue that the procedure introduces
unnecessary risks to the infant such as infection and water
inhalation.4
Or umbilical cord nonseverance – UCNS, is the practice of leaving the
umbilical cord uncut after childbirth so that the baby is left attached
to the placenta until the cord naturally separates at the umbilicus.
This usually occurs within 3–10 days after birth. The practice is
performed mainly for spiritual purposes of the parents, including for
the perceived spiritual connection between placenta and newborn.5
Sometimes known as quiet birth, is a birthing procedure advised by
L. Ron Hubbard and advocated by Scientologists in which "everyone
attending the birth should refrain from spoken words as much as
possible."6

Method
Medicated Childbirth

Description
Health care providers can provide pain relief during labor with
different types of medication, including epidurals, spinal blocks,
combined spinal-epidurals, and systemic and local analgesia. There
are benefits and side effects of each.7

Figure 3.1 - Expectant parents in a childbirth preparation class. 8

Choosing Location of Childbirth & Who Will Deliver
The vast majority of births occur in a hospital setting. However, one percent of women choose
to deliver at home (Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Curtin, & Mathews, 2015). Women who are at
low risk for birth complications can successfully deliver at home. More than half (67%) of home
deliveries are by certified nurse midwives. Midwives are trained and licensed to assist in
delivery and are far less expensive than the cost of a hospital delivery. However, because of the
potential for a complication during the birth process, most medical professionals recommend
that delivery take place in a hospital. In addition to home births, one-third of out-of-hospital
births occur in freestanding clinics, birthing centers, in physician’s offices, or other locations.9

Childbirth
Onset of Labor
Childbirth typically occurs within a week of a woman’s due date, unless the woman is pregnant
with more than one fetus, which usually causes her to go into labor early. As a pregnancy
progresses into its final weeks, several physiological changes occur in response to hormones
that trigger labor.

A common sign that labor is beginning is the so-called “bloody show.” During pregnancy, a plug
of mucus accumulates in the cervical canal, blocking the entrance to the uterus. Approximately
1–2 days prior to the onset of true labor, this plug loosens and is expelled, along with a small
amount of blood.
As labor nears, the mothers’ pituitary gland produces oxytocin. This begins to stimulate
stronger, more painful uterine contractions, which—in a positive feedback loop—stimulate the
secretion of prostaglandins from fetal membranes. Like oxytocin, prostaglandins also enhance
uterine contractile strength. The fetal pituitary gland also secretes oxytocin, which increases
prostaglandins even further.
And the stretching of the cervix by a full-term fetus in the head-down position is regarded as a
stimulant to uterine contractions. Combined, these stimulate true labor.10

Stages of Birth for Vaginal Delivery
The First Stage
Uterine contractions signify that the first stage of labor has begun. These contractions may
initially last about 30 seconds and be spaced 15 to 20 minutes apart. These increase in duration
and frequency to more than a minute in length and about 3 to 4 minutes apart. Typically,
doctors advise that they be called when contractions are coming about every 5 minutes. Some
women experience false labor or Braxton-Hicks Contractions, especially with the first child.
These may come and go. They tend to diminish when the mother begins walking around. Real
labor pains tend to increase with walking. In one out of 8 pregnancies, the amniotic sac or
water in which the fetus is suspended may break before labor begins. In such cases, the
physician may induce labor with the use of medication if it does not begin on its own in order to
reduce the risk of infection. Normally this sac does not rupture until the later stages of labor.
The first stage of labor is typically the longest. During this stage the cervix or opening to the
uterus dilates to 10 centimeters or just under 4 inches. This may take around 12-16 hours for
first children or about 6-9 hours for women who have previously given birth. Labor may also
begin with a discharge of blood or amniotic fluid.

Figure 3.2 - Early cervical dilation.11

The Second Stage
The passage of the baby through the birth canal is the second stage of labor. This stage takes
about 10-40 minutes. Contractions usually come about every 2-3 minutes. The mother pushes
and relaxes as directed by the medical staff. Normally the head is delivered first. The baby is
then rotated so that one shoulder can come through and then the other shoulder. The rest of
the baby quickly passes through. At this stage, an episiotomy, or incision made in the tissue
between the vaginal opening and anus, may be performed to avoid tearing the tissue of the
back of the vaginal opening (Mayo Clinic, 2016). The baby's mouth and nose are suctioned out.
The umbilical cord is clamped and cut.12

The Third Stage
The third and final stage of labor is relatively painless. During this stage, the placenta or
afterbirth is delivered. This is typically within 20 minutes after delivery. If an episiotomy was
performed it is stitched up during this stage.14

Figure 3.4 - delivery of the placenta and associated fetal membranes. 15

Additional Considerations
More than 50% of women giving birth at hospitals use an epidural anesthesia during delivery
(American Pregnancy Association, 2015). An epidural block is a regional analgesic that can be
used during labor and alleviates most pain in the lower body without slowing labor. The
epidural block can be used throughout labor and has little to no effect on the baby. Medication
is injected into a small space outside the spinal cord in the lower back. It takes 10 to 20 minutes
for the medication to take effect. An epidural block with stronger medications, such as
anesthetics, can be used shortly before a Cesarean Section or if a vaginal birth requires the use
of forceps or vacuum extraction.16
Women giving birth can also receive other pain medications (although medications given
through injection can have negative side effects on the baby). In emergency situations (such as
the need for a C-section), women may be given general anesthesia. They can also choose not to
utilize any pain medications. That is often referred to as natural childbirth.

Figure 3.5 – Natural childbirth.17

Women can also use alternate positions (including standing, squatting, being on hands and
knees, and using a birthing stool) and laboring, and even delivering in tubs of warm water to
help relieve the pain of childbirth.

Medical Interventions in Childbirth
Sometimes women cannot go into labor on their own and/or deliver vaginally. Let’s look at
induction of labor and Cesarean Sections.
Sometimes a baby’s arrival may need to be induced before labor begins naturally. Induction of
labor may be recommended for a variety of reasons when there is concern for the health of the
mother or baby. For example:
 The mother is approaching two weeks beyond her due date and labor has not started
naturally
 The mother’s water has broken, but contractions have not begun
 There is an infection in the mother’s uterus
 The baby has stopped growing at the expected pace
 There is not enough amniotic fluid surrounding the baby
 The placenta peels away, either partially or completely, from the inner wall of the uterus
before delivery
 The mother has a medical condition that might put her or her baby at risk, such as high
blood pressure or diabetes (Mayo Clinic, 2014).
A Cesarean Section (C-section) is surgery to deliver the baby by being removed through the
mother's abdomen. In the United States, about one in three women have their babies delivered
this way (Martin et al., 2015). Most C-sections are done when problems occur during delivery
unexpectedly. These can include:

C-sections are also more common among women carrying more than one baby. Although the
surgery is relatively safe for mother and baby, it is considered major surgery and carries health
risks. Additionally, it also takes longer to recover from a C-section than from vaginal birth. After
healing, the incision may leave a weak spot in the wall of the uterus. This could cause problems
with an attempted vaginal birth later. In the past, doctors were hesitant to allow a vaginal birth
after a C-section. However, now more than half of women who have a C-section go on to have a
vaginal birth later.20 This is referred to as a Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC).

Assessing the Newborn
The Apgar assessment is conducted one minute and five minutes after birth. This is a very quick
way to assess the newborn's overall condition. Five measures are assessed: Heart rate,
respiration, muscle tone (assessed by touching the baby's palm), reflex response (the Babinski
reflex is tested), and color. A score of 0 to 2 is given on each feature examined. An Apgar of 5 or
less is cause for concern. The second Apgar should indicate improvement with a higher score.22

Figure 3.9 – The Apgar assessment.23

Another way to assess the condition of the newborn is the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment
Scale (NBAS). The baby's motor development, muscle tone, and stress response are assessed.
This tool has been used around the world to further assess the newborn, especially those with
low Apgar scores, and to make comparisons of infants in different cultures (Brazelton & Nugent,
1995).
Newborns are also routinely screened for different conditions. Within the first 24 to 48 hours
after birth, babies born in hospitals undergo a simple heel stick and a few drops of blood are
collected on a special paper card. Providers test those dried blood spots for a variety of
different congenital disorders, or conditions that are present when the baby is born. In
California, newborns are now screened for 80 different genetic and congenital disorders.

Newborns are also screened for hearing disorders and certain serious heart problems using
methods other than dried blood spots.25

Problems of the Newborn
Anoxia
Anoxia is a temporary lack of oxygen to the brain. Difficulty during delivery may lead to anoxia
which can result in brain damage or in severe cases, death. Babies who suffer both low birth
weight and anoxia are more likely to suffer learning disabilities later in life as well.

Low Birth Weight
A child is considered low birth weight if he or she weighs less than 5 pounds 8 ounces (2500
grams). About 8.2 percent of babies born in the United States are of low birth weight (Center
for Disease Control, 2015a). Sixty-seven percent of these babies are also preterm.
A low birth weight baby has difficulty maintaining adequate body temperature because it lacks
the fat that would otherwise provide insulation. Such a baby is also at more risk for infection.
Very low birth weight babies (2 pounds or less) have an increased risk of developing cerebral
palsy. Many causes of low birth weight are preventable with proper prenatal care.

Preterm
A newborn might also have a low birth weight if it is born at less than 37 weeks gestation,
which qualifies it as a preterm baby (CDC, 2015c). Early birth can be triggered by anything that
disrupts the mother's system. For instance, vaginal infections can lead to premature birth
because such infection causes the mother to release anti-inflammatory chemicals which, in
turn, can trigger contractions. Smoking and the use of other teratogens can lead to preterm
birth. A significant consequence of preterm birth includes respiratory distress syndrome, which
is characterized by weak and irregular breathing (see the image below). Premature babies often

cannot yet regulate their own temperature or feed by nursing or bottle. They may struggle to
regulate their heart rate effectively and may experience jaundice. They often require care in the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) until they are as healthy as a full-term baby.

Figure 3.11 - a premature baby on CPAP in the NICU.26

Small-for-Date Infants
Infants that have birth weights that are below expectation based on their gestational age are
referred to as small-for-date. These infants may be full term or preterm (see image below), but
still weigh less than 90% of all babies of the same gestational age. This is a very serious situation
for newborns as their growth was adversely affected. Regev et al. (2003) found that small-fordate infants died at rates more than four times higher than other infants.

Figure 3.12 - This baby was born at 32 weeks and only weighed 2 pounds and 15 ounces.27

Postmature
When babies are not born by 42 weeks gestation, or two weeks after their due date, they are
considered overdue or postmature. There are some concerns about how long the placenta can
function and most doctors will consider induction for overdue babies.

Stillborn
When a fetus (unborn baby) dies while still inside the mother (after 20-24 weeks gestation) or
dies during delivery (childbirth). It is said that the delivered baby is stillborn. The causes of
many stillbirths are unknown, even when special tests are done to learn the cause. Possible
causes include: nicotine, alcohol, or drugs taken by the mother during pregnancy, physical
trauma, radiation poisoning, Rh disease, and umbilical cord problems. The number of stillbirths
in the United States is about 1 in 115 births, which is about 26,000 a year, or one every 20
minutes.28

Characteristics of Newborns
Size
The average newborn in the United States weighs about 7.5 pounds and is about 20 inches in
length. For the first few days of life, infants typically lose about 5 percent of their body weight
as they eliminate waste and get used to feeding. This often goes unnoticed by most parents,
but can be cause for concern for those who have a smaller infant. This weight loss is temporary,
however, and is followed by a rapid period of growth.

Body Proportions
The head initially makes up about 50 percent of our entire length when we are developing in
the womb. At birth, the head makes up about 25 percent of our length (think about how much
of your length would be head if the proportions were still the same!).

Figure 3.14 – Body proportions from infancy to adulthood.30

Brain Development
Some of the most dramatic physical change that occurs during this period is in the brain. At
birth, the brain is about 25 percent its adult weight and this is not true for any other part of the
body. While most of the brain’s 100 to 200 billion neurons are present at birth, they are not
fully mature. During the next several years dendrites or connections between neurons will
undergo a period of transient exuberance or temporary dramatic growth.31

Appearance at Birth
During labor and birth, the infant's skull changes shape to fit through the birth canal,
sometimes causing the child to be born with a misshapen or elongated head. It will usually
return to normal on its own within a few days or weeks.

Some newborns have a fine, downy body hair called lanugo. It may be particularly noticeable
on the back, shoulders, forehead, ears and face of premature infants. Lanugo disappears within
a few weeks. Likewise, not all infants are born with lush heads of hair. Some may be nearly bald
while others may have very fine, almost invisible hair. Some babies are even born with a full
head of hair. Amongst fair-skinned parents, this fine hair may be blond, even if the parents are
not. The picture on the left shows lanugo on the shoulders of newborn twins.

Figure 3.15 - Lanugo on the shoulder and back of
twin girls.32

Figure 3.16 - A newborn baby covered in vernix.33

Immediately after birth, a newborn's skin is often grayish to dusky blue in color. As soon as the
newborn begins to breathe, usually within a minute or two, the skin's color returns to its
normal tone. Newborns are wet, covered in streaks of blood, and coated with a white
substance known as vernix, which is thought to act as an antibacterial barrier, seen in the
picture on the right.
The scalp may also be temporarily bruised or swollen, especially in hairless newborns, and the
area around the eyes may be puffy.
The newborn may also have Mongolian spots (blue or blue black birthmark on the lower back),
various other birthmarks, or peeling skin, particularly on the wrists, hands, ankles, and feet. 34
A newborn's genitals are enlarged and reddened, with male infants having an unusually large
scrotum. The breasts may also be enlarged, even in male infants. This is caused by naturallyoccurring maternal hormones and is a temporary condition.
The umbilical cord of a newborn is bluish-white in color. After birth, the umbilical cord is
normally cut, leaving a 1–2 inch stub. The umbilical stub will dry out, shrivel, darken, and
spontaneously fall off within about 3 weeks. Occasionally, hospitals may apply triple dye to the
umbilical stub to prevent infection, which may temporarily color the stub and surrounding skin
purple.

Figure 3.17 - The clamping and cutting of a newborn’s umbilical cord.35

Newborns lose many of the above physical characteristics quickly. Thus older babies look very
different. While older babies are considered "cute," newborns can be "unattractive" by the
same criteria and first time parents may need to be educated in this regard.36

Sleep
A newborn typically sleeps approximately 16.5 hours per 24-hour period. The infant sleeps in
several periods throughout the day and night, which means they wake often throughout the
day and night. (Salkind, 2005).37

Reflexes
Newborns are equipped with a number of reflexes, which are involuntary movements in
response to stimulation. Some of the more common reflexes, such as the sucking reflex and
rooting reflex, are important to feeding. The grasping and stepping reflexes are eventually
replaced by more voluntary behaviors. Within the first few months of life these reflexes
disappear, while other reflexes, such as the eye-blink, swallowing, sneezing, gagging, and
withdrawal reflex stay with us as they continue to serve important functions.39

Sensory Capacities
Throughout much of history, the newborn was considered a passive, disorganized being who
possessed minimal abilities. However, current research techniques have demonstrated just how
developed the newborn is with especially organized sensory and perceptual abilities.

Vision
The womb is a dark environment void of visual stimulation. Consequently, vision is the most
poorly developed sense at birth and time is needed to build those neural pathways between
the eye and the brain. Newborns typically cannot see further than 8 to 16 inches away from
their faces, and their visual acuity is about 20/400, which means that an infant can see
something at 20 feet that an adult with normal vision could see at 400 feet. Thus, the world
probably looks blurry to young infants.

Figure 3.19 – A newborn gazing up at a parent.40

Hearing
The infant’s sense of hearing is very keen at birth, and the ability to hear is evidenced as soon
as the 7th month of prenatal development. In fact, an infant can distinguish between very
similar sounds as early as one month after birth and can distinguish between a familiar and
unfamiliar voice even earlier. Infants are especially sensitive to the frequencies of sounds in
human speech and prefer the exaggeration of infant-directed speech, which will be discussed
39

later. Newborns also prefer their mother’s voices over another female when speaking the same
material (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980). Additionally, they will register in utero specific information
heard from their mother’s voice.41

Early Hearing
DeCasper and Spence (1986) tested 16 infants whose mothers had previously read to them
prenatally. The mothers read several passages to their fetuses, including the first 28
paragraphs of The Cat in the Hat, beginning when they were 7 months pregnant. The fetuses
had been exposed to the stories on average of 67 times or 3.5 hours.
During the testing, the infants were able to choose between recordings of two stories, one of
which was a story their mothers read to them while in the womb, based on how fast they
sucked on their pacifiers. They showed a preference for the stories that their mothers read to
them while in the womb.42

Figure 3.20 – A collection of children’s books.43

Touch and Pain
Immediately after birth, a newborn is sensitive to touch and temperature, and is also highly
sensitive to pain, responding with crying and cardiovascular responses (Balaban & Reisenauer,
2013). Newborns who are circumcised, which is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the
penis, without anesthesia experience pain as demonstrated by increased blood pressure,
increased heart rate, decreased oxygen in the blood, and a surge of stress hormones (United
States National Library of Medicine, 2016). Research has demonstrated that infants who were
circumcised without anesthesia experienced more pain and fear during routine childhood
vaccines. Fortunately, many circumcisions are now done with the use of local anesthetics.

Taste and Smell
Studies of taste and smell demonstrate that babies respond with different facial expressions,
suggesting that certain preferences are innate. Newborns can distinguish between sour, bitter,
sweet, and salty flavors and show a preference for sweet flavors. Newborns also prefer the
smell of their mothers. An infant only 6 days old is significantly more likely to turn toward its
own mother’s breast pad than to the breast pad of another baby’s mother (Porter, Makin,
Davis, & Christensen, 1992), and within hours of birth an infant also shows a preference for the
face of its own mother (Bushnell, 2001; Bushnell, Sai, & Mullin, 1989).
Infants seem to be born with the ability to perceive the world in an intermodal way; that is,
through stimulation from more than one sensory modality. For example, infants who sucked on
a pacifier with a smooth surface preferred looking at visual models of a pacifier with a smooth
surface. But those that were given a pacifier with a textured surface preferred to look at a
visual model of a pacifier with a textured surface.44

Conclusion
In this chapter we looked at:
 methods of childbirth preparation
 the process of childbirth (for both vaginal and Cesarean deliveries)
 assessing newborn health
 problems for the newborn
 characteristics of newborns (including appearance, reflexes, and perceptual abilities)
In the next three chapters we will explore the first three years of life more. Many rapid changes
occur during these foundational years.

Chapter 4: Physical Development in Infancy &
Toddlerhood
Chapter Objectives
After this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Describe the physical changes that occur during the first two years of life.
2. Identify common infant reflexes.
3. Discuss the sleep needs during the first two years of life.
4. Summarize the sequence of both fine and gross motor skills.
5. Recognize the developing sensory capacities of infants and toddlers.
6. Explain how to meet the evolving nutritional needs of infants and toddlers.

Introduction
Welcome to the story of development from infancy through toddlerhood; from birth until
about two years of age. Researchers have given this part of the life span more attention than
any other period, perhaps because changes during this time are so dramatic and so noticeable
and perhaps because we have assumed that what happens during these years provides a
foundation for one’s life to come. However, it has been argued that the significance of
development during these years has been overstated (Bruer, 1999). Nevertheless, this is the
period of life that contemporary educators, healthcare providers, and parents have focused on
most heavily. We will examine growth and nutrition during infancy, as well as other prominent
physical changes that take place during this time.1

Rapid Physical Changes
As mentioned in the previous chapter, the average newborn in the United States weighs about
7.5 pounds and is about 20 inches in length. After about a 5% weight loss in the first few days,
there is a period of rapid growth. By the time an infant is 4 months old, it usually doubles in
weight and by one year has tripled its birth weight. By age 2, the weight has quadrupled. The
average length at one year is about 26-32 inches.3
Two hormones are very important to this growth process. The first is Human Growth Hormone
(HGH) which influences all growth except that in the Central Nervous System (CNS). The
hormone influencing growth in the CNS is called Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. Together these
hormones influence the growth in early childhood.
Sleep is very important to the growth process as these hormones are released as children sleep
each night. As a result, children need 11 to 14 hours of sleep from 2 to 6 years old. Parents may
establish rituals, such as reading a story, taking a bath, brushing teeth, etc. to help children
wind down and get the sleep they so desperately need.4

Proportions of the Body
Another dramatic physical change that takes place in the first several years of life is the change
in body proportions. The head initially makes up about 50 percent of our entire length when we
are developing in the womb. At birth, the head makes up about 25 percent of our length (think
about how much of your length would be head if the proportions were still the same!). By age
25 it comprises about 20 percent our length. Imagine now how difficult it must be to raise one’s
head during the first year of life! And indeed, if you have ever seen a 2 to 4 month old infant
lying on the stomach trying to raise the head, you know how much of a challenge this is. The
comparison in this graphic was originally introduced in the last chapter.

Figure 4.3 - Shown from left to right: Human body proportions at birth, at 2 years, at 6 years, at 12 years, and at 19
years.6

Some of the most dramatic physical change that occurs during this period is in the brain. At
birth, the brain is about 25 percent its adult weight and this is not true for any other part of the
body. By age 2, it is at 75 percent its adult weight, at 95 percent by age 6 and at 100 percent by
age 7 years.
While most of the brain’s 100 to 200 billion neurons are present at birth, they are not fully
mature and during the next several years dendrites or connections between neurons will
undergo a period of transient exuberance or temporary dramatic growth.

Components of the Neuron

Figure 4.4 – The neuron.7

There is a proliferation of these dendrites during the first two years so that by age 2, a single
neuron might have thousands of dendrites. After this dramatic increase, the neural pathways
that are not used will be eliminated thereby making those that are used much stronger.8.
Because of this proliferation of dendrites, by age two a single neuron might have thousands of
dendrites.
Synaptogenesis, or the formation of connections between neurons, continues from the
prenatal period forming thousands of new connections during infancy and toddlerhood. This
period of rapid neural growth is referred to as Synaptic Blooming.9 This activity is occurring
primarily in the cortex or the thin outer covering of the brain involved in voluntary activity and
thinking.
The prefrontal cortex that is located behind our forehead continues to grow and mature
throughout childhood and experiences an additional growth spurt during adolescence. It is the
last part of the brain to mature and will eventually comprise 85 percent of the brain’s
weight. Experience will shape which of these connections are maintained and which of these
are lost. Ultimately, about 40 percent of these connections will be lost (Webb, Monk, and
Nelson, 2001). As the prefrontal cortex matures, the child is increasingly able to regulate or

control emotions, to plan activity, strategize, and have better judgment. Of course, this is not
fully accomplished in infancy and toddlerhood, but continues throughout childhood and
adolescence.
Another major change occurring in the central nervous system is the development of myelin, a
coating of fatty tissues around the axon of the neuron. Myelin helps insulate the nerve cell and
speed the rate of transmission of impulses from one cell to another. This enhances the building
of neural pathways and improves coordination and control of movement and thought
processes. The development of myelin continues into adolescence but is most dramatic during
the first several years of life.10

Figure 4.5 – MRI scans of the human brain.11

Reflexes
Infants are equipped with a number of reflexes which are involuntary movements in response
to stimulation. These include the sucking reflex (infants suck on objects that touch their lips
automatically), the rooting reflex (which involves turning toward any object that touches the
cheek), the palmar grasp (the infant will tightly grasp any object placed in its palm), and the
dancing reflex (evident when the infant is held in a standing position and moves its feet up and
down alternately as if dancing). These movements occur automatically and are signals that the
infant is functioning well neurologically. Within the first several weeks of life these reflexes are
replaced with voluntary movements or motor skills.12
Infants and children grow and develop at a rapid pace during the first few years of life. The
development of both gross and fine motor skills helps a child go from a completely dependent
newborn to an independently functioning toddler in about a 3-year span.13

Gross Motor Skills
Voluntary movements involve the use of large muscle groups and are typically large
movements of the arms, legs, head, and torso. They are referred to as gross motor skills (or
large motor skills). These skills begin to develop first. Examples include moving to bring the chin
up when lying on the stomach, moving the chest up, rocking back and forth on hands and
knees, and then crawling. But it also includes exploring an object with one’s feet as many
babies do as early as 8 weeks of age if seated in a carrier or other device that frees the hips.
This may be easier than reaching for an object with the hands, which requires much more
practice (Berk, 2007). And sometimes an infant will try to move toward an object while crawling
and surprisingly move backward because of the greater amount of strength in the arms than in
the legs! This also tends to lead infants to pulling up on furniture, usually with the goal of
reaching a desired object. Usually this will also lead to taking steps and eventually walking.22

Physical Gross Motor Milestones
As stated above, children grow very quickly and meet physical milestones rapidly in the first few
years of life. The following is a table of the major milestones (behaviors or physical skills seen in
infants and children as they grow and develop that typically occur within normal range) that
occur in children during those first formative years. 23

Fine Motor Skills
More exact movements of the feet, toes, hands, and fingers are referred to as fine motor skills
(or small motor skills). These include the ability to reach and grasp an object in coordination
with vision. Newborns cannot grasp objects voluntarily but do wave their arms toward objects
of interest. At about 4 months of age, the infant is able to reach for an object, first with both
arms and within a few weeks, with only one arm. Grasping an object involves the use of the
fingers and palm, but no thumbs.
Use of the thumb comes at about 9 months of age when the infant is able to grasp an object
using the forefinger and thumb. This is known as the pincer grip. This ability greatly enhances
the ability to control and manipulate an object and infants take great delight in this newfound
ability. They may spend hours picking up small objects from the floor and placing them in
containers. And as those objects will often next go into the mouth, caregivers must be vigilant
about keeping items small enough to be choking hazards out of reach of little fingers. By 9
months, an infant can also watch a moving object, reach for it as it approaches and grab it. This
is quite a complicated set of actions if we remember how difficult this would have been just a
few months earlier.26

Figure 4.14 – An infant feeding themselves.27

Physical Fine Motor Milestones
While fine motor skills are slower to develop (in accordance with proximodistal development),
pretty remarkable progress is made in fine motor development during the first two years. As
stated above, in the first few years of life children go from having no intentional fine motor
control to being able to manipulate objects to play and learn, as well as beginning to care of
themselves. The following is a table of the major milestones in fine motor development.

Sensory Capacities
Throughout much of history, the newborn was considered a passive, disorganized being who
possessed minimal abilities. William James, an early psychologist, had described the newborn’s
world as “a blooming, buzzing confusion,” (Shaffer, 1985). However, current research
techniques have demonstrated just how developed the newborn is with especially organized
sensory and perceptual abilities.

Vision
The womb is a dark environment void of visual stimulation. Consequently, vision is the most
poorly developed sense at birth and time is needed to build those neural pathways between
the eye and the brain. Newborns typically cannot see further than 8 to 16 inches away from
their faces (which is about the distance from the newborn's face to the mother/caregiver when
an infant is breastfeeding/bottle-feeding). Their visual acuity is about 20/400, which means that
an infant can see something at 20 feet that an adult with normal vision could see at 400 feet.
Thus, the world probably looks blurry to young infants. Because of their poor visual acuity, they
look longer at checkerboards with fewer large squares than with many small squares. Infants'
thresholds for seeing a visual pattern are higher than adults'. Thus, toys for infants are
sometimes manufactured with black and white patterns rather than pastel colors because the
higher contrast between black and white makes the pattern more visible to the immature visual
system. By about 6 months, infants' visual acuity improves and approximates adult 20/25
acuity.

Figure 4.15 – An infant looking up at the person feeding them. 29

When viewing a person’s face, newborns do not look at the eyes the way adults do; rather, they
tend to look at the chin—a less detailed part of the face. However, by 2 or 3 months, they will
seek more detail when exploring an object visually and begin showing preferences for unusual
images over familiar ones, for patterns over solids, for faces over patterns, and for threedimensional objects over flat images. Newborns have difficulty distinguishing between colors,
29

Image by Ben_Kerckx on Pixabay

99 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

but within a few months they are able to discriminate between colors as well as adults do.
Sensitivity to binocular depth cues, which require inputs from both eyes, is evident by about 3
months and continues to develop during the first 6 months. By 6 months, the infant can
perceive depth perception in pictures as well (Sen, Yonas, & Knill, 2001). Infants who have
experience crawling and exploring will pay greater attention to visual cues of depth and modify
their actions accordingly (Berk, 2007).

Hearing
The infant’s sense of hearing is very keen at birth, and the ability to hear is evident as soon as
the 7th month of prenatal development. In fact, an infant can distinguish between very similar
sounds as early as one month after birth and can distinguish between a familiar and unfamiliar
voice even earlier. Infants are especially sensitive to the frequencies of sounds in human speech
and prefer the exaggeration of infant-directed speech, which will be discussed later.
Additionally, infants are innately ready to respond to the sounds of any language, but some of
this ability will be lost by 7 or 8 months as the infant becomes familiar with the sounds of a
particular language and less sensitive to sounds that are part of an unfamiliar language.
Newborns also prefer their mother’s voices over another female when speaking the same
material (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980). Additionally, they will register in utero specific information
heard from their mother’s voice. You may remember the Cat in the Hat study featured in the
last chapter that illustrates this.

Touch and Pain
Immediately after birth, a newborn is sensitive to touch and temperature, and is also highly
sensitive to pain, responding with crying and cardiovascular responses (Balaban & Reisenauer,
2013). Newborns who are circumcised, which is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the
penis, without anesthesia experience pain as demonstrated by increased blood pressure,
increased heart rate, decreased oxygen in the blood, and a surge of stress hormones (United
States National Library of Medicine, 2016). Research has demonstrated that infants who were
circumcised without anesthesia experienced more pain and fear during routine childhood
vaccines. Fortunately, local painkillers are now used during many circumcision.

Taste and Smell
Studies of taste and smell demonstrate that babies respond with different facial expressions,
suggesting that certain preferences are innate. Newborns can distinguish between sour, bitter,
sweet, and salty flavors and show a preference for sweet flavors. Newborns also prefer the
smell of their mothers. An infant only 6 days old is significantly more likely to turn toward its
own mother’s breast pad than to the breast pad of another baby’s mother (Porter, Makin,
Davis, & Christensen, 1992), and within hours of birth an infant also shows a preference for the
face of its own mother (Bushnell, 2001; Bushnell, Sai, & Mullin, 1989).
Infants seem to be born with the ability to perceive the world in an intermodal way; that is,
through stimulation from more than one sensory modality. For example, infants who sucked on
100 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

a pacifier with either a smooth or textured surface preferred to look at a corresponding
(smooth or textured) visual model of the pacifier. By 4 months, infants can match lip
movements with speech sounds and can match other audiovisual events. Although sensory
development emphasizes the afferent processes used to take in information from the
environment, these sensory processes can be affected by the infant's developing motor
abilities. Reaching, crawling, and other actions allow the infant to see, touch, and organize his
or her experiences in new ways.30.

Figure 4.16 – The responses of infants to different tastes. 31

Nutrition
Nutritional needs change with age. Let’s examine how caregivers should nourish children during
the first years of life and some risks to nutrition that they should be aware of.

Breastfeeding
Breast milk is considered the ideal diet for newborns. Colostrum, the first breast milk produced
during pregnancy and just after birth has been described as “liquid gold” (United States
Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), 2011). It is very rich in nutrients and
antibodies. Breast milk changes by the third to fifth day after birth, becoming much thinner, but
containing just the right amount of fat, sugar, water and proteins to support overall physical
and neurological development. For most babies, breast milk is also easier to digest than
formula. Formula fed infants experience more diarrhea and upset stomachs. The absence of
antibodies in formula often results in a higher rate of ear infections and respiratory infections.
Children who are breastfed have lower rates of childhood leukemia, asthma, obesity, type 1
and 2 diabetes, and a lower risk of SIDS. The USDHHS recommends that mothers breastfeed

their infants until at least 6 months of age and that breast milk be used in the diet throughout
the first year or two.

Figure 4.17 – A nurse helping a new mother to breastfeed. 32

Maternal Benefits of Breastfeeding
Several recent studies have reported that it is not just babies that benefit from breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding stimulates contractions in the mother’s uterus to help it regain its normal size,
and women who breastfeed are more likely to space their pregnancies further apart. Mothers
who breastfeed are at lower risk of developing breast cancer (Islami et al., 2015), especially
among higher risk racial and ethnic groups (Islami et al., 2015; Redondo et al., 2012). Women
who breastfeed have lower rates of ovarian cancer (Titus-Ernstoff, Rees, Terry, & Cramer,
2010), reduced risk for developing Type 2 diabetes (Schwarz et al., 2010; Gunderson, et al.,
2015), and rheumatoid arthritis (Karlson, Mandl, Hankinson, & Grodstein, 2004). In most
studies these benefits have been seen in women who breastfeed longer than 6 months.

Challenges to Breastfeeding
However, most mothers who breastfeed in the United States stop breastfeeding at about 6-8
weeks, often in order to return to work outside the home (USDHHS, 2011). Mothers can
certainly continue to provide breast milk to their babies by expressing and freezing the milk to
be bottle-fed at a later time or by being available to their infants at feeding time. However,
some mothers find that after the initial encouragement they receive in the hospital to
breastfeed, the outside world is less supportive of such efforts. Some workplaces support
breastfeeding mothers by providing flexible schedules and welcoming infants, but many do not.
In addition, not all women may be able to breastfeed. Women with HIV are routinely
discouraged from breastfeeding as the infection may pass to the infant. Similarly, women who
are taking certain medications or undergoing radiation treatment may be told not to breastfeed
(USDHHS, 2011).
32

Cost of Breastfeeding
In addition to the nutritional benefits of breastfeeding, breast milk does not have to be
purchased. Anyone who has priced formula recently can appreciate this added incentive to
breastfeeding. Prices for a year’s worth of formula and feeding supplies can cost well over
$1,500 (USDHHS, 2011).
But there are also those who challenge the belief that breast milk is free. For breastmilk to be
completely beneficial for infants the mother's life choices will ultimately affect the quality of
the nutrition an infant will receive. Let's consider the nutritional intake of the mother.
Breastfeeding will both limit some food and drink choices as well as necessitate an increased
intake of healthier options. A simple trip down the supermarket aisles will show you that
nutritious and healthier options can be more expensive than some of the cheaper more
processed options. A large variety of vegetable and fruits must be consumed, accompanied by
the right proportions and amounts of the whole grains, dairy products, and fat food groups.
Additionally, it is also encouraged for breastfeeding mothers to take vitamins regularly. That
raises the question of how free breastfeeding truly is.

A Historic Look at Breastfeeding
The use of wet nurses, or lactating women hired to nurse others' infants, during the middle
ages eventually declined and mothers increasingly breastfed their own infants in the late
1800s. In the early part of the 20th century, breastfeeding began to go through another
decline. By the 1950s, it was practiced less frequently as formula began to be viewed as
superior to breast milk.
In the late 1960s and 1970s, greater emphasis began to be placed on natural childbirth and
breastfeeding and the benefits of breastfeeding were more widely publicized. Gradually rates
of breastfeeding began to climb, particularly among middle-class educated mothers who
received the strongest messages to breastfeed.
Today, women receive consultation from lactation specialists before being discharged from
the hospital to ensure that they are informed of the benefits of breastfeeding and given
support and encouragement to get their infants to get used to taking the breast. This does
not always happen immediately and first time mothers, especially, can become upset or
discouraged. In this case, lactation specialists and nursing staff can encourage the mother to
keep trying until baby and mother are comfortable with the feeding.33

Alternatives to Breastfeeding
There are many reasons that mothers struggle to breastfeed or should not breastfeed,
including: low milk supply, previous breast surgeries, illicit drug use, medications, infectious
disease, and inverted nipples. Other mothers choose not to breastfeed. Some reasons for this
include: lack of personal comfort with nursing, the time commitment of nursing, inadequate or

unhealthy diet, and wanting more convenience and flexibility with who and when an infant can
be fed. For these mothers and infants, formula is available. Besides breast milk, infant formula
is the only other milk product that the medical community considers nutritionally acceptable
for infants under the age of one year (as opposed to cow's milk, goat's milk, or follow-on
formula). It can be used in addition to breastfeeding (supplementing) or as an alternative to
breastmilk.
The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow's milk whey and casein as a
protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carbohydrate source, a
vitamin-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. In addition, there
are infant formulas which use soybeans as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the
United States and Great Britain) and formulas which use protein hydrolysed into its component
amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins34.

Figure 4.18 – A father bottle-feeding his infant.35

One early argument given to promote the practice of breastfeeding was that it promoted
bonding and healthy emotional development for infants. However, this does not seem to be
the case. Breastfed and bottle-fed infants adjust equally well emotionally (Ferguson &
Woodward, 1999). This is good news for mothers who may be unable to breastfeed for a
variety of reasons and for fathers who might feel left out.

When, What, and How to Introduce Solid Foods
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children be introduced to foods other than
breast milk or infant formula when they are about 6 months old. Every child is different. Here
are some signs that show that an infant is ready for foods other than breast milk or infant
formula:
 Child can sit with little or no support.
 Child has good head control.
 Child opens his or her mouth and leans forward when food is offered.

How Should Foods Be Introduced?
The American Academy of Pediatrics says that for most children, foods do not need to be given
in a certain order. Children can begin eating solid foods at about 6 months old. By the time they
are 7 or 8 months old, children can eat a variety of foods from different food groups. These
foods include infant cereals, meat or other proteins, fruits, vegetables, grains, yogurts and
cheeses, and more.
If feeding infant cereals, it is important to offer a variety of fortified infant cereals such as oat,
barley, and multi-grain instead of only rice cereal. The Food and Drug Administration does not
recommend only providing infant rice cereal because there is a risk for children to be exposed
to arsenic.
Children should be allowed to try one food at a time at first and there should be 3 to 5 days
before another food is introduced. This helps caregivers see if the child has any problems with
that food, such as food allergies.

Figure 4.19 – A baby being fed solid food.36

The eight most common allergenic foods are milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts,
wheat, and soybeans. It is no longer recommended that caregivers delay introducing these
foods to all children, but if there is a family history of food allergies, the child’s doctor or nurse
should be consulted.37
It may take numerous attempts before a child gains a taste for it. So caregivers should not give
up if a food is refused on first offering.

Child Malnutrition
There can be serious effects for children when there are deficiencies in their nutrition. Let’s
explore a few types of nutritional concerns.

Wasting
Children in developing countries and countries experiencing the harsh conditions of war are at
risk for two major types of malnutrition, also referred to as wasting. Infantile marasmus refers
to starvation due to a lack of calories and protein. Children who do not receive adequate
nutrition lose fat and muscle until their bodies can no longer function. Babies who are
breastfed are much less at risk of malnutrition than those who are bottle-fed.
After weaning, children who have diets deficient in protein may experience kwashiorkor or the
“disease of the displaced child,” often occurring after another child has been born and taken

39

over breastfeeding. This results in a loss of appetite and swelling of the abdomen as the body
begins to break down the vital organs as a source of protein.
Around the world the rates of wasting have been dropping. However, according to the World
Health Organization and UNICEF, in 2014 there were 50 million children under the age of five
that experienced these forms of wasting, and 16 million were severely wasted (UNICEF, 2015).
Worldwide, these figures indicate that nearly 1 child in every 13 suffers from some form of
wasting. The majority of these children live in Asia (34.3 million) and Africa (13.9 million).
Wasting can occur as a result of severe food shortages, regional diets that lack certain proteins
and vitamins, or infectious diseases that inhibit appetite (Latham, 1997).

Figure 4.20 – A child suffering from wasting.40

The consequences of wasting depend on how late in the progression of the disease parents and
guardians seek medical treatment for their children. Unfortunately, in some cultures families do
not seek treatment early, and as a result by the time a child is hospitalized the child often dies
within the first three days after admission (Latham, 1997). Several studies have reported longterm cognitive effects of early malnutrition (Galler & Ramsey, 1989; Galler, Ramsey, Salt &
Archer, 1987; Richardson, 1980), even when home environments were controlled (Galler,
Ramsey, Morley, Archer & Salt, 1990). Lower IQ scores (Galler et al., 1987), poor attention
(Galler & Ramsey, 1989), and behavioral issues in the classroom (Galler et al., 1990) have been
reported in children with a history of serious malnutrition in the first few years of life.41

Milk Anemia
Milk Anemia in the United States: About 9 million children in the United States are
malnourished (Children’s Welfare, 1998). More still suffer from milk anemia, a condition in
which milk consumption leads to a lack of iron in the diet. This can be due to the practice of

giving toddlers milk as a pacifier-when resting, when riding, when waking, and so on. Appetite
declines somewhat during toddlerhood and a small amount of milk (especially with added
chocolate syrup) can easily satisfy a child’s appetite for many hours. The calcium in milk
interferes with the absorption of iron in the diet as well. Many preschools and daycare centers
give toddlers a drink after they have finished their meal in order to prevent spoiling their
appetites.42

Failure to Thrive
Failure to thrive (FTT) occurs in children whose nutritional intake is insufficient for supporting
normal growth and weight gain. FTT typically presents before two years of age, when growth
rates are highest. Parents may express concern about picky eating habits, poor weight gain, or
smaller size compared relative to peers of similar age. Physicians often identify FTT during
routine office visits, when a child's growth parameters are not tracking appropriately on growth
curves.
FTT can be caused by physical or mental issues within the child (such as errors of metabolism,
acid reflux, anemia, diarrhea, Cystic fibrosis, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, cleft palate, tongue
tie, milk allergies, hyperthyroidism, congenital heart disease, etc.) It can also be caused by
caregiver’s actions (environmental), including inability to produce enough breastmilk,
inadequate food supply, providing an insufficient number of feedings, and neglect. These
causes may also co-exist. For instance, a child who is not getting sufficient nutrition may act
content so that caregivers do not offer feedings of sufficient frequency or volume, and a child
with severe acid reflux who appears to be in pain while eating may make a caregiver hesitant to
offer sufficient feedings.43

Health
Infants depend on the adults that care for them to promote and protect their health. The
following section addresses common physical conditions that can affect infants, the danger of
shaking babies, and the importance of immunizations.

Common Physical Conditions and Issues during Infancy
Some physical conditions and issues are very common during infancy. Many are normal, and
the infant's caregivers can deal with them if they occur. Mostly, it is a matter of the caregivers
learning about what is normal for their infant and getting comfortable with the new routine in
the household. New parents and caregivers often have questions about the following:
 Bowel Movements
 Colic
 Diaper Rash
 Spitting Up/Vomiting
 Teething

Bowel Movements
Infants' bowel movements go through many changes in color and consistency, even within the
first few days after birth. While the color, consistency, and frequency of stool will vary, hard or
dry stools may indicate dehydration and increased frequency of watery stools may indicate
diarrhea.

Figure 4.21 – An infant getting their diaper changed.44

Colic
Many infants are fussy in the evenings, but if the crying does not stop and gets worse
throughout the day or night, it may be caused by colic. According to the American Academy of
Pediatrics, about one-fifth of all infants develop colic, usually starting between 2 and 4 weeks of
age. They may cry inconsolably or scream, extend or pull up their legs, and pass gas. Their
stomachs may be enlarged. The crying spells can occur anytime, although they often get worse
in the early evening.
The colic will likely improve or disappear by the age of 3 or 4 months. There is no definite
explanation for why some infants get colic. Health care providers can help ensure there is no
medical reason behind the crying.
Some infants seem to be soothed by being held, rocked, or wrapped snugly in a blanket. Some
like a pacifier.

Shaken Baby Syndrome
Here is a PSA from the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
The crying.
The late-night feedings.
The diaper changes.
The exhaustion.
If you’ve ever been around a baby who won’t stop crying, you know there’s potential
to get frustrated. Focus on calming yourself and understand that you may not be able
to calm your baby. It’s not your fault or your baby’s.46
It’s normal for healthy babies to cry and some babies cry much more than others. And they
cannot always be consoled and caregivers can feel pushed to the limit. When caregivers lose
control and shake a baby it can have devastating effects.
Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is a severe form of physical child abuse. SBS may be caused
from vigorously shaking an infant by the shoulders, arms, or legs. The “whiplash” effect can
cause intracranial (within the brain) or intraocular (within the eyes) bleeding. Often there is
no obvious external head trauma. Still, children with SBS may display some outward signs:
 Change in sleeping pattern or inability to be awakened
 Confused, restless, or agitated state
 Convulsions or seizures
 Loss of energy or motivation
 Slurred speech
 Uncontrollable crying
 Inability to be consoled
 Inability to nurse or eat

Shaken Baby Syndrome
SBS can result in death, mental retardation or developmental delays, paralysis, severe motor
dysfunction, spasticity, blindness, and seizures.
Who’s at Risk?
Small children are especially vulnerable to this type of abuse. Their heads are large in
comparison to their bodies, and their neck muscles are weak. Children under one year of age
are at highest risk, but SBS has been reported in children up to five years of age. Shaking
often occurs in response to a baby crying or having a toilet-training accident. The perpetrator
tends to be male and is primarily the biological father or the mother’s boyfriend or partner.
Caregivers are responsible for about 9%-21% of cases. The explanation typically provided by
the caregiver—”I was playing with the baby”—does not begin to account for the severity of
trauma. Many times there is also a history of child abuse.

Can It Be Prevented?
SBS is completely preventable. However, it is not known whether educational efforts will
effectively prevent this type of abuse. Home visitation programs are shown to prevent child
abuse in general. Because the child’s father or the mother’s partner often causes SBS, they
should be included in home visitation programs. Home visits bring community resources to
families in their homes. Health professionals provide information, healthcare, psychological
support, and other services that can help people to be more effective parents and caregivers.
The Bottom Line
 Shaking a baby can cause death or permanent brain damage. It can result in life-long
disability.
 Healthy strategies for dealing with a crying baby include:
o finding the reason for the crying
o checking for signs of illness or discomfort, such as diaper rash, teething, tight
clothing;
o feeding or burping;
o soothing the baby by rubbing its back; gently rocking; offering a pacifier;
singing or talking;
o taking a walk using a stroller or a drive in a properly-secured car seat;
o or calling the doctor if sickness is suspected
 All babies cry. Caregivers often feel overwhelmed by a crying baby. Calling a friend,
relative, or neighbor for support or assistance lets the caregiver take a break from the
situation. If immediate support is not available, the caregiver could place the baby in a
crib (making sure the baby is safe), close the door, and check on the baby every five
minutes.47

Figure 4.23 – Medical professionals caring for an infant.48

Abusive Head Trauma
Shaken baby syndrome is part abusive head trauma (AHT), severe form of physical child
abuse that results in an injury to the brain of a child. This is important to note because:
 Abusive head trauma is a leading cause of physical child abuse deaths in children
under 5 in the United States.
 Abusive head trauma accounts for approximately one third of all child maltreatment
deaths.
 The most common trigger for abusive head trauma is inconsolable crying.
 Babies less than one year old are at greatest risk of injury from abusive head
trauma.49

Teething
Although newborns usually have no visible teeth, baby teeth begin to appear generally about 6
months after birth. During the first few years, all 20 baby teeth will push through the gums, and
most children will have their full set of these teeth in place by age 3.
An infant's front four teeth usually appear first, at about 6 months of age, although some
children don't get their first tooth until 12-14 months. As their teeth break through the gums,
some infants become fussy, and irritable; lose their appetite; or drool more than usual.
The FDA does not recommend gum-numbing medications with an ingredient called benzocaine
because they can cause a potentially fatal condition in young children. Safe forms of relief
include a chilled teething ring or gently rubbing the child's gums with a clean finger.

Spitting Up/Vomiting
Spitting up is a common occurrence for young infants and is usually not a sign of a more serious
problem. But if an infant is not gaining weight or shows other signs of illness, a health care
provider should be consulted.

Figure 4.24 – A father holding his baby with a cloth protecting his shoulder from spit-up.50

Urination
Infants urinate as often as every 1 to 3 hours or as infrequently as every 4 to 6 hours. In case of
sickness or if the weather is very hot, urine output might drop by half and still be normal. If an
infant shows any signs of distress while urinating or if any blood is found in a wet diaper
medical care should be sought.

Diaper Rash
A rash on the skin covered by a diaper is quite common. It is usually caused by irritation of the
skin from being in contact with stool and urine. It can get worse during bouts of diarrhea.
Diaper rash usually can be prevented by frequent diaper changes.

Jaundice
Jaundice can cause an infant's skin, eyes, and mouth to turn a yellowish color. The yellow color
is caused by a buildup of bilirubin, a substance that is produced in the body during the normal
process of breaking down old red blood cells and forming new ones.
Normally the liver removes bilirubin from the body. But, for many infants, in the first few days
after birth, the liver is not yet working at its full power. As a result, the level of bilirubin in the
blood gets too high, causing the infant's color to become slightly yellow—this is jaundice.
Although jaundice is common and usually not serious, in some cases, high levels of bilirubin
could cause brain injury. All infants with jaundice need to be seen by a health care provider.
Many infants need no treatment. Their livers start to catch up quickly and begin to remove
bilirubin normally, usually within a few days after birth. For some infants, health care providers

prescribe phototherapy—a treatment using a special lamp—to help break down the bilirubin in
their bodies.

Figure 4.25 – An infant receiving treatment for jaundice. 51

Protecting Health through Immunization
One way we can protect a child’s health (and those around them) is through immunization. The
vaccines (given through injection) may hurt a little…but the diseases they can prevent can hurt
a lot more! Immunization shots, or vaccinations, are essential. They protect against things like
measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, polio, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping
cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as for children. Here’s why.
The immune system helps the human body fight germs by producing substances to combat
them. Once it does, the immune system “remembers” the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines
contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person, the vaccine
triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity.
Before vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it.
Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune.
Vaccines are the best defense we have against serious, preventable, and sometimes deadly
contagious diseases. Vaccines are some of the safest medical products available, but like any
other medical product, there may be risks. Accurate information about the value of vaccines as
well as their possible side effects helps people to make informed decisions about vaccination.

Figure 4.26 – A nurse giving an infant vaccinations.52

Potential Side Effects
Vaccines, like all medical products, may cause side effects in some people. Most of these side
effects are minor, such as redness or swelling at the injection site. Read further to learn about
possible side effects from vaccines.
Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm
or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days.53 Serious side effects after vaccination, such
as severe allergic reaction, are very rare.54
Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for safety, and like any medication, vaccines can
cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put
the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially
deadly disease.

How Well Do Vaccines Work?
Vaccines work really well. No medicine is perfect, of course, but most childhood vaccines
produce immunity about 90–100% of the time.
What about the argument made by some people that vaccines don’t work that well . . . that
diseases would be going away on their own because of better hygiene or sanitation, even if
there were no vaccines?
That simply isn’t true. Certainly better hygiene and sanitation can help prevent the spread of
disease, but the germs that cause disease will still be around, and as long as they are they will
continue to make people sick.

All vaccines must be licensed (approved) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before
being used in the United States, and a vaccine must go through extensive testing to show that it
works and that it is safe before the FDA will approve it. Among these tests are clinical trials,
which compare groups of people who get a vaccine with groups of people who get a control. A
vaccine is approved only if FDA makes the determination that it is safe and effective for its
intended use.
If you look at the history of any vaccine-preventable disease, you will virtually always see that
the number of cases of disease starts to drop when a vaccine is licensed. Vaccines are the most
effective tool we have to prevent infectious diseases.

Opposition to Vaccines
In 2010, a pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak in California sickened 9,143 people and
resulted in 10 infant deaths: the worst outbreak in 63 years (Centers for Disease Control
2011b). Researchers, suspecting that the primary cause of the outbreak was the waning
strength of pertussis vaccines in older children, recommended a booster vaccination for 11–12year-olds and also for pregnant women (Zacharyczuk 2011). Pertussis is most serious for babies;
one in five needs to be hospitalized, and since they are too young for the vaccine themselves, it
is crucial that people around them be immunized (Centers for Disease Control 2011b). Several
states, including California, have been requiring the pertussis booster for older children in
recent years with the hope of staving off another outbreak.
But what about people who do not want their children to have this vaccine, or any other? That
question is at the heart of a debate that has been simmering for years. Vaccines are biological
preparations that improve immunity against a certain disease. Vaccines have contributed to the
eradication and weakening of numerous infectious diseases, including smallpox, polio, mumps,
chicken pox, and meningitis.

Figure 4.27 - These two young children contracted polio.55

However, many people express concern about potential negative side effects from vaccines.
These concerns range from fears about overloading the child’s immune system to controversial
reports about devastating side effects of the vaccines.56
Although children continue to get several vaccines up to their second birthday, these vaccines
do not overload the immune system. Every day, an infant’s healthy immune system successfully
fights off thousands of antigens – the parts of germs that cause their immune system to
respond. Even if your child receives several vaccines in one day, vaccines contain only a tiny
amount of antigens compared to the antigens your baby encounters every day.
This is the case even if your child receives combination vaccines. Combination vaccines take two
or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into one shot. Children get the
same protection as they do from individual vaccines given separately—but with fewer shots.57
One misapprehension is that the vaccine itself might cause the disease it is supposed to be
immunizing against.58 Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection, but this
“imitation” infection does not cause illness. Instead it causes the immune system to develop
the same response as it does to a real infection so the body can recognize and fight the vaccinepreventable disease in the future. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection
can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be
expected as the body builds immunity.59
Another commonly circulated concern is that vaccinations, specifically the MMR vaccine (MMR
stands for measles, mumps, and rubella), are linked to autism. The autism connection has been
particularly controversial. In 1998, a British physician named Andrew Wakefield published a
study in Great Britain’s Lancet magazine that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The report
received a lot of media attention, resulting in British immunization rates decreasing from 91
percent in 1997 to almost 80 percent by 2003, accompanied by a subsequent rise in measles
cases (Devlin 2008). A prolonged investigation by the British Medical Journal proved that not
only was the link in the study nonexistent, but that Dr. Wakefield had falsified data in order to
support his claims (CNN 2011). Dr. Wakefield was discredited and stripped of his license, but
the doubt still lingers in many parents’ minds.
In the United States, many parents still believe in the now discredited MMR-autism link and
refuse to vaccinate their children. Other parents choose not to vaccinate for various reasons
like religious or health beliefs. In one instance, a boy whose parents opted not to vaccinate
returned home to the U.S. after a trip abroad; no one yet knew he was infected with measles.

The boy exposed 839 people to the disease and caused 11 additional cases of measles, all in
other unvaccinated children, including one infant who had to be hospitalized.

Figure 4.28 - A baby with measles60

According to a study published in Pediatrics (2010), the outbreak cost the public sector $10,376
per diagnosed case. The study further showed that the intentional non-vaccination of those
infected occurred in students from private schools, public charter schools, and public schools in
upper-socioeconomic areas (Sugerman et al. 2010).61

The Immunization Schedule
On-time vaccination throughout childhood is essential because it helps provide immunity
before children are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. Vaccines are tested to
ensure that they are safe and effective for children to receive at the recommended ages.62
Fully vaccinated children in the U.S. are protected against sixteen potentially harmful diseases.
Vaccine-preventable diseases can be very serious, may require hospitalization, or even be
deadly — especially in infants and young children.63

Safety
There are different risks to infant safety. According to the CDC, nonfatal injury rates varied by
age group.
 Nonfatal suffocation rates were highest for those less than 1 year of age.
 Rates for fires or burns, and drowning were highest for children 4 years and younger.
 Children 1 to 4 years of age had the highest rates of nonfatal falls and poisoning.
And the leading causes of injury death also differed by age group.
 For children less than 1 year of age, two–thirds of injury deaths were due to suffocation.
 Drowning was the leading cause of injury or death for those 1 to 4 years of age.66

Car Seat Safety
Motor vehicle injuries are a leading cause of death among children in the United States. But
many of these deaths can be prevented.

Car Seat Safety




In the United States, 723 children ages 12 years and younger died as occupants in
motor vehicle crashes during 2016, and more than 128,000 were injured in 2016.
One CDC study found that, in one year, more than 618,000 children ages 0-12 rode in
vehicles without the use of a child safety seat or booster seat or a seat belt at least
some of the time.
Of the children ages 12 years and younger who died in a crash in 2016 (for which
restraint use was known), 35% were not buckled up.67

Buckling children in age- and size-appropriate car seats, booster seats, and seat belts reduces
the risk of serious and fatal injuries:
 Car seat use reduces the risk for injury in a crash by 71-82% for children when
compared to seat belt use alone.
 Booster seat use reduces the risk for serious injury by 45% for children aged 4–8 years
when compared with seat belt use alone.
 For older children and adults, seat belt use reduces the risk for death and serious
injury by approximately half.68

Sleep
A newborn typically sleeps approximately 16.5 hours per 24-hour period. This is usually
polyphasic sleep in that the infant is accumulating the 16.5 hours over several sleep periods
throughout the day (Salkind, 2005). The infant is averaging 15 hours per 24-hour period by one
month, and 14 hours by 6 months. By the time children turn two, they are averaging closer to
10 hours per 24 hours. Additionally, the average newborn will spend close to 50% of the sleep
time in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase, which decreases to 25% to 30% in childhood. 70

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Safe Sleep
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is identified when the death of a healthy infant occurs
suddenly and unexpectedly, and medical and forensic investigation findings (including an
autopsy) are inconclusive. SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants 1 to 12 months old,
and approximately 1,500 infants died of SIDS in 2013 (CDC, 2015). Because SIDS is diagnosed
when no other cause of death can be determined, possible causes of SIDS are regularly
researched. One leading hypothesis suggests that infants who die from SIDS have
abnormalities in the area of the brainstem responsible for regulating breathing (WeekesShackelford & Shackelford, 2005).71

Figure 4.33 – A baby sleeping safely.72

Risk Factors
Babies are at higher risk for SIDS if they:
 Sleep on their stomachs
 Sleep on soft surfaces, such as an adult mattress, couch, or chair or under soft
coverings
 Sleep on or under soft or loose bedding
 Get too hot during sleep

Are exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb or in their environment, such as at
home, in the car, in the bedroom, or other areas
Sleep in an adult bed with parents, other children, or pets; this situation is especially
dangerous if:
o The adult smokes, has recently had alcohol, or is tired.
o The baby is covered by a blanket or quilt.
o The baby sleeps with more than one bed-sharer.
o The baby is younger than 11 to 14 weeks of age.

Reducing the Risks
There have been dramatic improvements in reducing baby deaths during sleep since the
1990s, when recommendations were introduced to place babies on their back for sleep.
However, since the late 1990s, declines have slowed.

Figure 4.32 – A graph showing the decline in sleep-related infant deaths.73

In 2012, the Back to Sleep campaign became the Safe to Sleep campaign. Safe to Sleep aims
to educate all caregivers about SIDS and safe sleep practices. Current recommendations to
reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep related causes of infant death:
 Always place baby on his or her back to sleep (for naps and at night).
 Use a firm and flat surface.
 Use only a tight fitting sheet on the sleep surface; no other bedding or soft items in
the sleep area.
 Breastfeed.

1. Describe the substages of the Piaget’s sensorimotor stage.
2. Explain how the social environment affects cognitive development according to
Vygotsky’s theory.
3. Discuss the progression of language development during the first two years.
4. Compare the theories of language development.
5. Define classical and operant conditioning.
6. Summarize the different types of memory

Introduction
In an effort to better understand the large spectrum of cognition that infants and toddlers go
through, it is important to analyze and comprehend various theories that relate to their growth
and development. This chapter will take a look at the following theorists: Piaget, Vygotsky,
Chomsky, Skinner, Pavlov, Watson, Bandura, and Bronfenbrenner.

Piaget
Jean Piaget is the most noted theorist when it comes to children's cognitive development. He
believed that children's cognition develops in stages. He explained this growth in the following
stages:
1. Sensory Motor Stage (Birth through 2 years old)
2. Preoperational Stage (2-7 years old)
3. Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years old)
4. Formal Operational Stage (12 years old- adulthood)
In this cognitive chapter we will focus on his first stage which occurs in infancy.1

Piaget and Sensorimotor Intelligence
Piaget describes intelligence in infancy as sensorimotor or based on direct, physical contact.
Infants taste, feel, pound, push, hear, and move in order to experience the world. Let’s explore
the transition infants make from responding to the external world reflexively as newborns to
solving problems using mental strategies as two years old.

Description
This active learning begins with automatic movements or reflexes.
A ball comes into contact with an infant’s cheek and is
automatically sucked on and licked.
The infant begins to discriminate between objects and adjust
responses accordingly as reflexes are replaced with voluntary
movements. An infant may accidentally engage in a behavior and
find it interesting such as making a vocalization. This interest
motivates trying to do it again and helps the infant learn a new
behavior that originally occurred by chance. At first, most actions
have to do with the body, but in months to come, will be directed
more toward objects.
The infant becomes more and more actively engaged in the outside
world and takes delight in being able to make things happen.
Repeated motion brings particular interest as the infant is able to
bang two lids together from the cupboard when seated on the
kitchen floor.
The infant can engage in behaviors that others perform and
anticipate upcoming events. Perhaps because of continued
maturation of the prefrontal cortex, the infant becomes capable of
having a thought and carrying out a planned, goal-directed activity
such as seeking a toy that has rolled under the couch. The object
continues to exist in the infant’s mind even when out of sight and
the infant now is capable of making attempts to retrieve it.
The infant more actively engages in experimentation to learn about
the physical world. Gravity is learned by pouring water from a cup
or pushing bowls from high chairs. The caregiver tries to help the
child by picking it up again and placing it on the tray. And what
happens? Another experiment! The child pushes it off the tray
again causing it to fall and the caregiver to pick it up again!
The child is now able to solve problems using mental strategies, to
remember something heard days before and repeat it, to engage in
pretend play, and to find objects that have been moved even when
out of sight. Take for instance, the child who is upstairs in a room
with the door closed, supposedly taking a nap. The doorknob has a
safety device on it that makes it impossible for the child to turn the
knob. After trying several times in vain to push the door or turn the
doorknob, the child carries out a mental strategy learned from prior
experience to get the door opened-he knocks on the door! The
child is now better equipped with mental strategies for problemsolving.

Evaluating Piaget’s Sensorimotor Stage
Piaget opened up a new way of looking at infants with his view that their main task is to
coordinate their sensory impressions with their motor activity. However, the infant’s cognitive
world is not as neatly packaged as Piaget portrayed it, and some of Piaget’s explanations for the
cause of change are debated. In the past several decades, sophisticated experimental
techniques have been devised to study infants, and there have been a large number of research
studies on infant development. Much of the new research suggests that Piaget’s view of
sensorimotor development needs to be modified (Baillargeon, 2014; Brooks & Meltzoff, 2014;
Johnson & Hannon, 2015).

Object Permanence
One necessary modification would be to when children develop object permanence. Infants
seem to be able to recognize that objects have permanence at much younger ages than Piaget
proposed (even as young as 3.5 months of age).

The A-not-B Error
The data does not always support Piaget’s claim that certain processes are crucial in transitions
from one stage to the next. For example, in Piaget’s theory, an important feature in the
progression into substage 4, coordination of secondary circular reactions, is an infant’s
inclination to search for a hidden object in a familiar location rather than to look for the object
in a new location. Thus, if a toy is hidden twice, initially at location A and subsequently at
location B, 8- to 12-month-old infants search correctly at location A initially. But when the toy is
subsequently hidden at location B, they make the mistake of continuing to search for it at
location A. A-not-B error is the term used to describe this common mistake. Older infants are
less likely to make the A-not-B error because their concept of object permanence is more
complete.

Researchers have found, however, that the A-not-B error does not show up consistently
(Sophian, 1985). The evidence indicates that A-not-B errors are sensitive to the delay between
hiding the object at B and the infant’s attempt to find it (Diamond, 1985). Thus, the A-not-B
error might be due to a failure in memory. Another explanation is that infants tend to repeat a
previous motor behavior (Clearfield & others, 2006; Smith, 1999).

Vygotsky
Development Is Determined By Environmental Factors
Piaget set the tone for much of current-day research but his theory has also received a great
deal of criticism. Many believe that Piaget ignored the huge influence that society and culture
have in shaping a child’s development. At a similar time, another researcher named Lev
Vygotsky (1896–1934) had come to similar conclusions as Piaget about children’s development,
in thinking that children learned about the world through physical interaction with it. However,
where Piaget felt that children moved naturally through different stages of development, based
on biological predispositions and their own individual interactions with the world, Vygotsky
claimed that adult or peer intervention was a much more important part of the developmental
process.
Vygotsky concentrated more on the child’s immediate social and cultural environment and his
or her interactions with adults and peers. He argued that development occurred first through
children’s immediate social interactions, and then moved to the individual level as they began
to internalize their learning. While Piaget saw the child as actively discovering the world
through individual interactions with it, Vygotsky saw the child as more of an apprentice,
learning through a social environment of others who had more experience and were sensitive
to the child’s needs and abilities.4

Language Development
Do newborns communicate? Absolutely! However, they do not communicate with the use of
language. Instead, they communicate their thoughts and needs with body posture (being
relaxed or still), gestures, cries, and facial expressions. A person who spends adequate time
with an infant can learn which cries indicate pain and which ones indicate hunger, discomfort,
or frustration as well as translate their vocalizations, movements, gestures and facial
expressions.

Figure 5.3 – An infant looking up at the camera.7

Stages of Language Development
1. Intentional Vocalizations: Cooing and taking turns: Infants begin to vocalize and repeat
vocalizations within the first couple of months of life. That gurgling, musical vocalization
called cooing can serve as a source of entertainment to an infant who has been laid
down for a nap or seated in a carrier on a car ride. Cooing serves as practice for
vocalization as well as the infant hears the sound of his or her own voice and tries to
repeat sounds that are entertaining. Infants also begin to learn the pace and pause of
conversation as they alternate their vocalization with that of someone else and then
take their turn again when the other person’s vocalization has stopped. Cooing initially
involves making vowel sounds like “oooo”. Later, consonants are added to vocalizations
such as “nananananana”.
2. Babbling and gesturing: At about four to six months of age, infants begin making even
more elaborate vocalizations that include the sounds required for any language.
Guttural sounds, clicks, consonants, and vowel sounds stand ready to equip the child
with the ability to repeat whatever sounds are characteristic of the language heard.
Eventually, these sounds will no longer be used as the infant grows more accustomed to
a particular language. Deaf babies also use gestures to communicate wants, reactions,
and feelings. Because gesturing seems to be easier than vocalization for some toddlers,
sign language is sometimes taught to enhance one’s ability to communicate by making
use of the ease of gesturing. The rhythm and pattern of language is used when deaf
babies sign just as it is when hearing babies babble.
3. Understanding: At around ten months of age, the infant can understand more than he
or she can say. You may have experienced this phenomenon as well if you have ever
tried to learn a second language. You may have been able to follow a conversation more
easily than to contribute to it.

4. Holophrastic speech: Children begin using their first words at about 12 or 13 months of
age and may use partial words to convey thoughts at even younger ages. These one
word expressions are referred to as holophrastic speech. For example, the child may say
“ju” for the word “juice” and use this sound when referring to a bottle. The listener
must interpret the meaning of the holophrase and when this is someone who has spent
time with the child, interpretation is not too difficult. They know that “ju” means “juice”
which means the baby wants some milk! But, someone who has not been around the
child will have trouble knowing what is meant. Imagine the parent who to a friend
exclaims, “Ezra’s talking all the time now!” The friend hears only “ju da ga” which, the
parent explains, means “I want some milk when I go with Daddy.”

Figure 5.4 – Two children playing with toys.8

5. Underextension: A child who learns that a word stands for an object may initially think
that the word can be used for only that particular object. Only the family’s Irish Setter is
a “doggie”. This is referred to as underextension. More often, however, a child may
think that a label applies to all objects that are similar to the original object. In
overextension all animals become “doggies”, for example.
6. First words and cultural influences: First words if the child is using English tend to be
nouns. The child labels objects such as cup or ball. In a verb-friendly language such as
Chinese, however, children may learn more verbs. This may also be due to the different
emphasis given to objects based on culture. Chinese children may be taught to notice
action and relationship between objects while children from the United States may be
taught to name an object and its qualities (color, texture, size, etc.). These differences
can be seen when comparing interpretations of art by older students from China and
the United States.
7. Vocabulary growth spurt: One year olds typically have a vocabulary of about 50 words.
But by the time they become toddlers, they have a vocabulary of about 200 words and
begin putting those words together in telegraphic speech (I think of it now as 'text
8

Image by the U.S. Air Force is in the public domain

133 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

message' speech because texting is more common and is similar in that text messages
typically only include the minimal amount of words to convey the message).
8. Two word sentences and telegraphic speech: Words are soon combined and 18 month
old toddlers can express themselves further by using expressions such as “baby byebye” or “doggie pretty”. Words needed to convey messages are used, but the articles
and other parts of speech necessary for grammatical correctness are not yet used.
These expressions sound like a telegraph (or perhaps a better analogy today would be
that they read like a text message) where unnecessary words are not used. “Give baby
ball” is used rather than “Give the baby the ball.” Or a text message of “Send money
now!” rather than “Dear Mother. I really need some money to take care of my
expenses.”9

themselves with words. Here is a table of common language milestones for infants and

Child-Directed Speech
Why is a horse a “horsie”? Have you ever wondered why adults tend to use “baby talk” or that
sing-song type of intonation and exaggeration used when talking to children? This represents a
universal tendency and is known as child-directed speech or parentheses (historically referred
11

Developmental Milestones by the CDC is in the public domain

135 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

to as motherese). It involves exaggerating the vowel and consonant sounds, using a highpitched voice, and delivering the phrase with great facial expression. Why is this done? It may
be in order to clearly articulate the sounds of a word so that the child can hear the sounds
involved. Or it may be because when this type of speech is used, the infant pays more attention
to the speaker and this sets up a pattern of interaction in which the speaker and listener are in
tuned with one another.12

Theories of Language Development
The following two theories of language development represent two extremes in the level of
interaction required for language to occur (Berk, 2007).

Chomsky and the Language Acquisition Device
The view known as nativism advocated by Noam Chomsky suggests that infants are equipped
with a neurological construct referred to as the language acquisition device or LAD that makes
infants ready for language. Language develops as long as the infant is exposed to it. No
teaching, training, or reinforcement is required for language to develop.

Social Pragmatics
Another view emphasizes the child’s active engagement in learning language out of a need to
communicate. The child seeks information, memorizes terms, imitates the speech heard from
others and learns to conceptualize using words as language is acquired. Many would argue that
all three of these dynamics foster the acquisition of language (Berger, 2004)13.

Theories of Cognitive Development, Learning, and Memory
Pavlov
Ivan Pavlov (1880-1937) was a Russian physiologist interested in studying digestion. As he
recorded the amount of salivation his laboratory dogs produced as they ate, he noticed that
they actually began to salivate before the food arrived as the researcher walked down the hall
and toward the cage. The dogs knew that the food was coming because they had learned to
associate the footsteps with the food. The key word here is “learned”. A learned response is
called a “conditioned” response.
Pavlov began to experiment with this “psychic” reflex. He began to ring a bell, for instance,
prior to introducing the food. Sure enough, after making this connection several times, the dogs
could be made to salivate to the sound of a bell. Once the bell had become an event to which
the dogs had learned to salivate, it was called a conditioned stimulus. The act of salivating to a
bell was a response that had also been learned, now termed in Pavlov’s jargon, a conditioned
response.

Notice that the response, salivation, is the same whether it is conditioned or unconditioned
(unlearned or natural). What changed is the stimulus to which the dog salivates. One is natural
(unconditioned) and one is learned (conditioned).

Figure 5.6 – Pavlov’s experiments with dogs and conditioning.14

Let’s think about how classical conditioning is used on us. One of the most widespread
applications of classical conditioning principles was brought to us by the psychologist, John B.
Watson15.

Classical Conditioning
Classical conditioning is a form of learning whereby a conditioned stimulus (CS) becomes
associated with an unrelated unconditioned stimulus (US), in order to produce a behavioral
response known as a conditioned response (CR). The conditioned response is the learned
response to the previously neutral stimulus. The unconditioned stimulus is usually a biologically
significant stimulus such as food or pain that elicits an unconditioned response (UR) from the
start. The conditioned stimulus is usually neutral and produces no particular response at first,
but after conditioning it elicits the conditioned response.
If we look at Pavlov's experiment, we can identify these four factors at work:
 The unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to seeing or smelling
their food.
 The unconditioned stimulus was the sight or smell of the food itself.
 The conditioned stimulus was the ringing of the bell. During conditioning, every time the

some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond
by salivating. After the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by



salivating when the bell was rung, even when the unconditioned stimulus (the food) was
absent.
The conditioned response, therefore, was the salivation of the dogs in response to the
conditioned stimulus (the ringing of the bell)16.

Neurological Response to Conditioning
Consider how the conditioned response occurs in the brain. When a dog sees food, the visual
and olfactory stimuli send information to the brain through their respective neural pathways,
ultimately activating the salivary glands to secrete saliva. This reaction is a natural biological
process as saliva aids in the digestion of food. When a dog hears a buzzer and at the same time
sees food, the auditory stimuli activates the associated neural pathways. However, since these
pathways are being activated at the same time as the other neural pathways, there are weak
synapse reactions that occur between the auditory stimuli and the behavioral response. Over
time, these synapses are strengthened so that it only takes the sound of a buzzer to activate
the pathway leading to salivation.

Operant Conditioning
Operant conditioning is a theory of behaviorism, a learning perspective that focuses on changes
in an individual's observable behaviors. In operant conditioning theory, new or continued
behaviors are impacted by new or continued consequences. Research regarding this principle of
learning was first studied by Edward L. Thorndike in the late 1800's, then brought to popularity
by B.F. Skinner in the mid-1900's. Much of this research informs current practices in human
behavior and interaction.

Skinner's Research
Thorndike's initial research was highly influential on another psychologist, B.F. Skinner. Almost
half a century after Thorndike's first publication of the principles of operant conditioning,
Skinner attempted to prove an extension to this theory—that all behaviors were in some way a
result of operant conditioning. Skinner theorized that if a behavior is followed by
reinforcement, that behavior is more likely to be repeated, but if it is followed by punishment, it
is less likely to be repeated. He also believed that this learned association could end, or become
extinct, if the reinforcement or punishment was removed.
To prove this, he placed rats in a box with a lever that when tapped would release a pellet of
food. Over time, the amount of time it took for the rat to find the lever and press it became
shorter and shorter, until finally the rat would spend most of its time near the lever eating. This
behavior became less consistent when the relationship between the lever and the food was
compromised. This basic theory of operant conditioning is still used by psychologists, scientists,
and educators today.

Shaping, Reinforcement Principles, and Schedules of Reinforcement
Operant conditioning can be viewed as a process of action and consequence. Skinner used this
basic principle to study the possible scope and scale of the influence of operant conditioning on
animal behavior. His experiments used shaping, reinforcement, and reinforcement schedules in
order to prove the importance of the relationship that animals form between behaviors and
results.
All of these practices concern the setup of an experiment. Shaping is the conditioning paradigm
of an experiment. The form of the experiment in successive trials is gradually changed to elicit a
desired target behavior. This is accomplished through reinforcement, or reward, of the
segments of the target behavior, and can be tested using a large variety of actions and rewards.
The experiments were taken a step further to include different schedules of reinforcement that
become more complicated as the trials continued. By testing different reinforcement schedules,
Skinner learned valuable information about the best ways to encourage a specific behavior, or
the most effective ways to create a long-lasting behavior. Much of this research has been
replicated on humans, and now informs practices in various environments of human behavior17.

Positive and Negative Reinforcement
Sometimes, adding something to the situation is reinforcing as in the cases we described above
with cookies, praise and money. Positive reinforcement involves adding something to the
situation in order to encourage a behavior. Other times, taking something away from a
situation can be reinforcing. For example, the loud, annoying buzzer on your alarm clock
encourages you to get up so that you can turn it off and get rid of the noise. Children whine in
order to get their parents to do something and often, parents give in just to stop the whining. In
these instances, negative reinforcement has been used.

Operant conditioning tends to work best if you focus on trying to encourage a behavior or move
a person into the direction you want them to go rather than telling them what not to do.
Reinforcers are used to encourage a behavior; punishers are used to stop behavior. A punisher
is anything that follows an act and decreases the chance it will reoccur. But often a punished
behavior doesn’t really go away. It is just suppressed and may reoccur whenever the threat of
punishment is removed. For example, a child may not cuss around you because you’ve washed
his mouth out with soap, but he may cuss around his friends. Or a motorist may only slow down
when the trooper is on the side of the freeway. Another problem with punishment is that when
a person focuses on punishment, they may find it hard to see what the other does right or
well. And punishment is stigmatizing; when punished, some start to see themselves as bad and
give up trying to change.
Reinforcement can occur in a predictable way, such as after every desired action is performed,
or intermittently, after the behavior is performed a number of times or the first time it is
performed after a certain amount of time. The schedule of reinforcement has an impact on
how long a behavior continues after reinforcement is discontinued. So a parent who has
rewarded a child’s actions each time may find that the child gives up very quickly if a reward is
not immediately forthcoming. Think about the kinds of behaviors that may be learned through
classical and operant conditioning. But sometimes very complex behaviors are learned quickly
and without direct reinforcement. Bandura’s Social Learning covered later in the chapter
explains how19.

Watson and Behaviorism
Another theorist who added to the spectrum of the behavioral movement was John B. Watson.
Watson believed that most of our fears and other emotional responses are classically
conditioned. He had gained a good deal of popularity in the 1920s with his expert advice on
parenting offered to the public. He believed that parents could be taught to help shape their
children’s behavior and tried to demonstrate the power of classical conditioning with his
famous experiment with an 18 month old boy named “Little Albert”. Watson sat Albert down
and introduced a variety of seemingly scary objects to him: a burning piece of newspaper, a
white rat, etc. But Albert remained curious and reached for all of these things. Watson knew
that one of our only inborn fears is the fear of loud noises so he proceeded to make a loud
noise each time he introduced one of Albert’s favorites, a white rat. After hearing the loud
noise several times paired with the rat, Albert soon came to fear the rat and began to cry when
it was introduced.
Watson filmed this experiment for posterity and used it to demonstrate that he could help
parents achieve any outcomes they desired, if they would only follow his advice. Watson wrote
columns in newspapers and in magazines and gained a lot of popularity among parents eager to
apply science to household order. Parenting advice was not the legacy Watson left us, however.
Where he really made his impact was in advertising. After Watson left academia, he went into

the world of business and showed companies how to tie something that brings about a natural
positive feeling to their products to enhance sales. Thus the union of sex and advertising!20.
Sometimes we do things because we’ve seen it pay off for someone else. They were operantly
conditioned, but we engage in the behavior because we hope it will pay off for us as well. This is
referred to as vicarious reinforcement (Bandura, Ross and Ross, 1963).

Figure 5.8 – A photograph taken during Little Albert research.21

Do parents socialize children or do children socialize parents?
Bandura (1986) suggests that there is interplay between the environment and the individual.
We are not just the product of our surroundings, rather we influence our surroundings. There is
interplay between our personality and the way we interpret events and how they influence us.
This concept is called reciprocal determinism. An example of this might be the interplay
between parents and children. Parents not only influence their child’s environment, perhaps
intentionally through the use of reinforcement, etc., but children influence parents as well.
Parents may respond differently with their first child than with their fourth. Perhaps they try to
be the perfect parents with their firstborn, but by the time their last child comes along they
have very different expectations both of themselves and their child. Our environment creates
us and we create our environment.

Social Learning Theory
Albert Bandura is a leading contributor to social learning theory. He calls our attention to the
ways in which many of our actions are not learned through conditioning; rather, they are
learned by watching others (1977). Young children frequently learn behaviors through
imitation. Sometimes, particularly when we do not know what else to do, we learn by modeling
or copying the behavior of others. A new employee, on his or her first day of a new job might
eagerly look at how others are acting and try to act the same way to fit in more quickly.
Adolescents struggling with their identity rely heavily on their peers to act as role-models.
Newly married couples often rely on roles they may have learned from their parents and begin
to act in ways they did not while dating and then wonder why their relationship has changed.

Memory and Attention
Memory
If we want to remember something tomorrow, we have to consolidate it into long-term
memory today. Long-term memory is the final, semi-permanent stage of memory. Unlike
sensory and short-term memory, long-term memory has a theoretically infinite capacity, and
information can remain there indefinitely. Long-term memory has also been called reference
memory, because an individual must refer to the information in long-term memory when
performing almost any task. Long-term memory can be broken down into two categories:
explicit and implicit memory.

Explicit Memory
Explicit memory, also known as conscious or declarative memory, involves memory of facts,
concepts, and events that require conscious recall of the information. In other words, the
individual must actively think about retrieving the information from memory. This type of
information is explicitly stored and retrieved—hence its name. Explicit memory can be further

22

subdivided into semantic memory, which concerns facts, and episodic memory, which concerns
primarily personal or autobiographical information.

Episodic Memory
Episodic memory is used for more contextualized memories. They are generally memories of
specific moments, or episodes, in one's life. As such, they include sensations and emotions
associated with the event, in addition to the who, what, where, and when of what happened.
An example of an episodic memory would be recalling your family's trip to the beach.
Autobiographical memory (memory for particular events in one's own life) is generally viewed
as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. One specific type of autobiographical
memory is a flashbulb memory, which is a highly detailed, exceptionally vivid "snapshot" of the
moment and circumstances in which a piece of surprising and consequential (or emotionally
arousing) news was heard. For example, many people remember exactly where they were and
what they were doing when they heard of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. This is
because it is a flashbulb memory.
Semantic and episodic memory are closely related; memory for facts can be enhanced with
episodic memories associated with the fact, and vice versa. For example, the answer to the
factual question "Are all apples red?" might be recalled by remembering the time you saw
someone eating a green apple. Likewise, semantic memories about certain topics, such as
football, can contribute to more detailed episodic memories of a particular personal event, like
watching a football game. A person that barely knows the rules of football will remember the
various plays and outcomes of the game in much less detail than a football expert.

Implicit Memory
In contrast to explicit (conscious) memory, implicit (also called "unconscious" or "procedural")
memory involves procedures for completing actions. These actions develop with practice over
time. Athletic skills are one example of implicit memory. You learn the fundamentals of a sport,
practice them over and over, and then they flow naturally during a game. Rehearsing for a
dance or musical performance is another example of implicit memory. Everyday examples
include remembering how to tie your shoes, drive a car, or ride a bicycle. These memories are
accessed without conscious awareness—they are automatically translated into actions without
us even realizing it. As such, they can often be difficult to teach or explain to other people.
Implicit memories differ from the semantic scripts described above in that they are usually
actions that involve movement and motor coordination, whereas scripts tend to emphasize
social norms or behaviors.

Figure 5.10 – A toddler walking.23

Short-Term Memory Storage
Short-term memory is the ability to hold information for a short duration of time (on the order
of seconds). In the process of encoding, information enters the brain and can be quickly
forgotten if it is not stored further in the short-term memory. George A. Miller suggested that
the capacity of short-term memory storage is approximately seven items plus or minus two, but
modern researchers are showing that this can vary depending on variables like the stored
items' phonological properties. When several elements (such as digits, words, or pictures) are
held in short-term memory simultaneously, their representations compete with each other for
recall, or degrade each other. Thereby, new content gradually pushes out older content, unless
the older content is actively protected against interference by rehearsal or by directing
attention to it.
Information in the short-term memory is readily accessible, but for only a short time. It
continuously decays, so in the absence of rehearsal (keeping information in short-term memory
by mentally repeating it) it can be forgotten.

Long-Term Memory Storage
In contrast to short-term memory, long-term memory is the ability to hold semantic
information for a prolonged period of time. Items stored in short-term memory move to longterm memory through rehearsal, processing, and use. The capacity of long-term memory
storage is much greater than that of short-term memory, and perhaps unlimited. However, the
duration of long-term memories is not permanent; unless a memory is occasionally recalled, it
may fail to be recalled on later occasions. This is known as forgetting.
Long-term memory storage can be affected by traumatic brain injury or lesions. Amnesia, a
deficit in memory, can be caused by brain damage. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to store
new memories; retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve old memories. These types of
amnesia indicate that memory does have a storage process25.

Chapter 6: Social and Emotional Development
in Infancy and Toddlerhood
Objectives
After this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Classify types of temperament.
2. Discuss the roles of culture and gender in socialization.
3. Describe the sequence of emotional development during the first two years.
4. Compare different theories of attachment and attachment styles.
5. Explain Erikson’s stage of trust versus mistrust.
6. Contrast child care options for families.

Introduction
While temperament is determined by genetics and emotions develop through maturation, the
early interactions we have with the adults that care for us as infants and toddlers are very
important for healthy emotional development. Let’s examine some of the important
interactions and milestones in social and emotional development during the first two years of
life.

Temperament
Perhaps you have spent time with a number of infants. How were they alike? How did they
differ? How do you compare with your siblings or other children you have known well? You may
have noticed that some seemed to be in a better mood than others and that some were more
sensitive to noise or more easily distracted than others. These differences may be attributed to
temperament. Temperament is the innate characteristics of the infant, including mood, activity
level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth.
In a 1956 landmark study, Chess and Thomas (1996) evaluated 141 children’s temperament
based on parental interviews. Referred to as the New York Longitudinal Study, infants were
assessed on 10 dimensions of temperament including:
 activity level
 threshold of responsiveness (how
intense a stimulus has to be for the
 rhythmicity (regularity of biological
child to react)
functions)
 quality of mood
 approach/withdrawal (how children
deal with new things)
 distractibility
 adaptability to situations
 attention span
 intensity of reactions
 persistence

Based on the infants’ behavioral profiles, they were categorized into three general types of
temperament:

As can be seen the percentages do not equal 100% as some children were not able to be placed
neatly into one of the categories. Think about how each type of child should be approached to
improve interactions with them. An easy child requires less intervention, but still has needs that
must not be overlooked. A slow-to-warm-up child may need to be given advance warning if
new people or situations are going to be introduced. A child with a difficult temperament may
need to be given extra time to burn off their energy.
A caregiver's ability to work well and accurately read the child will enjoy a goodness- of-fit,
meaning their styles match and communication and interaction can flow. Parents who
recognize each child’s temperament and accept it, will nurture more effective interactions with
the child and encourage more adaptive functioning.1

Parenting Is Bidirectional
Not only do parents affect their children, children influence their parents. A child’s
characteristics, such as temperament, affect parenting behaviors and roles. For example, an
infant with an easy temperament may enable parents to feel more effective, as they are easily
able to soothe the child and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy
infant elicits fewer positive reactions from his or her parents and may result in parents feeling
less effective in the parenting role (Eisenberg et al., 2008). Over time, parents of more difficult
children may become more punitive and less patient with their children (Clark, Kochanska, &
Ready, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999; Kiff, Lengua, & Zalewski, 2011). Parents who have a fussy,
difficult child are less satisfied with their marriages and have greater challenges in balancing
work and family roles (Hyde, Else-Quest, & Goldsmith, 2004). Thus, child temperament is one of
the child characteristics that influences how parents behave with their children.

Personality
Temperament does not change dramatically as we grow up, but we may learn how to work
around and manage our temperamental qualities. Temperament may be one of the things
about us that stays the same throughout development. In contrast, personality, defined as an
individual’s consistent pattern of feeling, thinking, and behaving, is the result of the continuous
interplay between biological disposition and experience.
Personality also develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson, Winer, & Goodvin,
2010). As children mature biologically, temperamental characteristics emerge and change over
time. A newborn is not capable of much self-control, but as brain-based capacities for selfcontrol advance, temperamental changes in self-regulation become more apparent. For
example, a newborn who cries frequently doesn’t necessarily have a grumpy personality; over
time, with sufficient parental support and increased sense of security, the child might be less
likely to cry.
In addition, personality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children’s
developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals,
their coping styles, their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, as well as many other
qualities are encompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by biological
dispositions, but even more by the child’s experiences with others, particularly in close
relationships, that guide the growth of individual characteristics. Indeed, personality
development begins with the biological foundations of temperament but becomes increasingly
elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The newborn that parents gazed upon thus
becomes an adult with a personality of depth and nuance.3

Culture and Personality
The term culture refers to all of the beliefs, customs, ideas, behaviors, and traditions of a
particular society that are passed through generations. Culture is transmitted to people through
language as well as through the modeling of behavior, and it defines which traits and behaviors
are considered important, desirable, or undesirable.
Within a culture there are norms and behavioral expectations. These cultural norms can dictate
which personality traits are considered important. The researcher Gordon Allport considered
culture to be an important influence on traits and defined common traits as those that are
recognized within a culture. These traits may vary from culture to culture based on differing
values, needs, and beliefs. Positive and negative traits can be determined by cultural
expectations: what is considered a positive trait in one culture may be considered negative in
another, thus resulting in different expressions of personality across cultures.

Figure 6.2 – A family from a non-Western culture.4

Considering cultural influences on personality is important because Western ideas and theories
are not necessarily applicable to other cultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008). There is a great
deal of evidence that the strength of personality traits varies across cultures, and this is
especially true when comparing individualist cultures (such as European, North American, and
Australian cultures) and collectivist cultures (such as Asian, African, and South American
cultures). People who live in individualist cultures tend to believe that independence,
competition, and personal achievement are important. In contrast, people who live in
collectivist cultures tend to value social harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over
individual needs. These values influence personality in different but substantial ways; for
example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed more personallyoriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed more sociallyoriented personality traits.5

Gender and Personality
In much the same manner that cultural norms can influence personality and behavior, gender
norms (the behaviors that males and females are expected to conform to in a given society) can
also influence personality by emphasizing different traits between different genders.

Figure 6.3 – A female infant wearing stereotypically
feminine clothing and accessories.6

Figure 6.4 – A male infant wearing stereotypically
masculine clothing.7

Ideas of appropriate behavior for each gender (masculine and feminine) vary among cultures
and tend to change over time. For example, aggression and assertiveness have historically been
emphasized as positive masculine personality traits in the United States. Meanwhile,
submissiveness and caretaking have historically been held as ideal feminine traits. While many
gender roles remain the same, others change over time. In 1938, for example, only 1 out of 5
Americans agreed that a married woman should earn money in industry and business. By 1996,
however, 4 out of 5 Americans approved of women working in these fields. This type of attitude
change has been accompanied by behavioral shifts that coincide with changes in trait
expectations and shifts in personal identity for men and women.8

Infant Emotions
At birth, infants exhibit two emotional responses: attraction and withdrawal. They show
attraction to pleasant situations that bring comfort, stimulation, and pleasure, and they
withdraw from unpleasant stimulation such as bitter flavors or physical discomfort. At around
two months, infants exhibit social engagement in the form of social smiling as they respond
with smiles to those who engage their positive attention (Lavelli & Fogel, 2005).
Social smiling becomes more stable and organized as infants learn to use their smiles to engage
their parents in interactions. Pleasure is expressed as laughter at 3 to 5 months of age, and
displeasure becomes more specific as fear, sadness, or anger between ages 6 and 8 months.

Anger is often the reaction to being prevented from obtaining a goal, such as a toy being
removed (Braungart-Rieker, Hill-Soderlund, & Karrass, 2010). In contrast, sadness is typically
the response when infants are deprived of a caregiver (Papousek, 2007). Fear is often
associated with the presence of a stranger, known as stranger wariness, or the departure of
significant others known as separation anxiety. Both appear sometime between 6 and 15
months after object permanence has been acquired. Further, there is some indication that
infants may experience jealousy as young as 6 months of age (Hart & Carrington, 2002).

Figure 6.5 – An infant making an angry facial expression.9

Emotions are often divided into two general categories: Basic emotions (primary emotions),
such as interest, happiness, anger, fear, surprise, sadness and disgust, which appear first, and
self-conscious emotions (secondary emotions), such as envy, pride, shame, guilt, doubt, and
embarrassment. Unlike primary emotions, secondary emotions appear as children start to
develop a self-concept, and require social instruction on when to feel such emotions. The
situations in which children learn self-conscious emotions varies from culture to culture.
Individualistic cultures teach us to feel pride in personal accomplishments, while in more
collective cultures children are taught to not call attention to themselves, unless you wish to
feel embarrassed for doing so (Akimoto & Sanbinmatsu, 1999).

Figure 6.6 – An infant making a sad facial expression10.

Facial expressions of emotion are important regulators of social interaction. In the
developmental literature, this concept has been investigated under the concept of social
referencing; that is, the process whereby infants seek out information from others to clarify a
situation and then use that information to act (Klinnert, Campos, & Sorce, 1983). To date, the
strongest demonstration of social referencing comes from work on the visual cliff. In the first
study to investigate this concept, Campos and colleagues (Sorce, Emde, Campos, & Klinnert,
1985) placed mothers on the far end of the “cliff” from the infant. Mothers first smiled to the
infants and placed a toy on top of the safety glass to attract them; infants invariably began
crawling to their mothers. When the infants were in the center of the table, however, the
mother then posed an expression of fear, sadness, anger, interest, or joy. The results were
clearly different for the different faces; no infant crossed the table when the mother showed
fear; only 6% did when the mother posed anger, 33% crossed when the mother posed sadness,
and approximately 75% of the infants crossed when the mother posed joy or interest.
Other studies provide similar support for facial expressions as regulators of social interaction.
Researchers posed facial expressions of neutral, anger, or disgust toward babies as they moved
toward an object and measured the amount of inhibition the babies showed in touching the
object (Bradshaw, 1986). The results for 10- and 15-month olds were the same: Anger produced
the greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, with neutral the least. This study was later
replicated using joy and disgust expressions, altering the method so that the infants were not
allowed to touch the toy (compared with a distractor object) until one hour after exposure to
the expression (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004). At 14 months of age, significantly more infants

touched the toy when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched the toy when the infants
saw disgust.
A final emotional change is in self-regulation. Emotional self-regulation refers to strategies we
use to control our emotional states so that we can attain goals (Thompson & Goodvin, 2007).
This requires effortful control of emotions and initially requires assistance from caregivers
(Rothbart, Posner, & Kieras, 2006). Young infants have very limited capacity to adjust their
emotional states and depend on their caregivers to help soothe themselves. Caregivers can
offer distractions to redirect the infant’s attention and comfort to reduce the emotional
distress. As areas of the infant’s prefrontal cortex continue to develop, infants can tolerate
more stimulation. By 4 to 6 months, babies can begin to shift their attention away from
upsetting stimuli (Rothbart et al, 2006). Older infants and toddlers can more effectively
communicate their need for help and can crawl or walk toward or away from various situations
(Cole, Armstrong, & Pemberton, 2010). This aids in their ability to self-regulate. Temperament
also plays a role in children’s ability to control their emotional states, and individual differences
have been noted in the emotional self-regulation of infants and toddlers (Rothbart & Bates,
2006).11

Figure 6.7 – A toddler at a park.12

Development of sense of self: During the second year of life, children begin to recognize
themselves as they gain a sense of self as separate from their primary caregiver. In a classic
experiment by Lewis and Brooks (1978) children 9 to 24 months of age were placed in front of a
mirror after a spot of rouge was placed on their nose as their mothers pretended to wipe
something off the child’s face. If the child reacted by touching his or her own nose rather than
that of the “baby” in the mirror, it was taken to suggest that the child recognized the reflection
as him or herself. Lewis and Brooks found that somewhere between 15 and 24 months most
infants developed a sense of self-awareness. Self-awareness is the realization that you are
separate from others (Kopp, 2011). Once a child has achieved self-awareness, the child is

as, sympathy or empathy.13

Social Emotional Milestones
As infants and toddlers interact with other people, their social and emotional skills develop.

Forming Attachments
Attachment is the close bond with a caregiver from which the infant derives a sense of
security. The formation of attachments in infancy has been the subject of considerable research
as attachments have been viewed as foundations for future relationships. Additionally,
attachments form the basis for confidence and curiosity as toddlers, and as important
influences on self- concept.

Freud’s Psychoanalytic Theory
According to Freud (1938) infants are oral creatures who obtain pleasure from sucking and
mouthing objects. Freud believed the infant will become attached to a person or object that
provides this pleasure. Consequently, infants were believed to become attached to their
mother because she was the one who satisfied their oral needs and provided pleasure. Freud
further believed that the infants will become attached to their mothers “if the mother is
relaxed and generous in her feeding practices, thereby allowing the child a lot of oral pleasure,”
(Shaffer, 1985, p. 435).

Harlow’s Research
In one classic study, Wisconsin University psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow investigated
the responses of young rhesus monkeys to explore if breastfeeding was the most important
factor to attachment.

Figure 6.8 – A rhesus monkey sucking its thumb.16

The infant monkeys were separated from their biological mothers, and two surrogate mothers
were introduced to their cages. The first mother (the wire mother) consisted of a round
wooden head, a mesh of cold metal wires, and a bottle of milk from which the baby monkey
could drink. The second mother was a foam-rubber form wrapped in a heated terry-cloth
blanket. The infant monkeys went to the wire mother for food, but they overwhelmingly
preferred and spent significantly more time with the warm terry-cloth mother. The warm terrycloth mother provided no food but did provide comfort (Harlow, 1958). The infant's need for
physical closeness and touching is referred to as contact comfort. Contact comfort is believed
to be the foundation for attachment. The Harlows’ studies confirmed that babies have social as
well as physical needs. Both monkeys and human babies need a secure base that allows them
to feel safe. From this base, they can gain the confidence they need to venture out and explore
their worlds.

Bowlby’s Theory
Building on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the concept of attachment
theory. He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an infant forms with the
mother (Bowlby, 1969). An infant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have
normal social and emotional development. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment
bond is very powerful and continues throughout life. He used the concept of secure base to
define a healthy attachment between parent and child (Bowlby, 1982). A secure base is a
parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as the child explores the surroundings.

Figure 6.9 – A mother offering a secure base as her infant plays on a slide.17

Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must be
responsive to the child’s physical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and child must
engage in mutually enjoyable interactions (Bowlby, 1969). Additionally, Bowlby observed that
infants would go to extraordinary lengths to prevent separation from their parents, such as
crying, refusing to be comforted, and waiting for the caregiver to return.

Figure 6.10 - This child is seeking comfort from an attachment figure.18

Bowlby also observed that these same expressions were common to many other mammals, and
consequently argued that these negative responses to separation serve an evolutionary
function. Because mammalian infants cannot feed or protect themselves, they are dependent
upon the care and protection of adults for survival. Thus, those infants who were able to
maintain proximity to an attachment figure were more likely to survive and reproduce.

Erikson: Trust vs. Mistrust
As previously discussed in chapter 1, Erikson formulated an eight-stage theory of psychosocial
development. Erikson was in agreement on the importance of a secure base, arguing that the
most important goal of infancy was the development of a basic sense of trust in one’s
caregivers. Consequently, the first stage, trust vs. mistrust, highlights the importance of
attachment. Erikson maintained that the first year to year and a half of life involves the
establishment of a sense of trust (Erikson, 1982). Infants are dependent and must rely on
others to meet their basic physical needs as well as their needs for stimulation and comfort. A
caregiver who consistently meets these needs instills a sense of trust or the belief that the
world is a trustworthy place. The caregiver should not worry about overly indulging a child’s
need for comfort, contact or stimulation.

Figure 6.11 – This baby-wearing father is creating trust with his infant child.19

Problems Establishing Trust
Erikson (1982) believed that mistrust could contaminate all aspects of one’s life and deprive the
individual of love and fellowship with others. Consider the implications for establishing trust if a
caregiver is unavailable or is upset and ill-prepared to care for a child. Or if a child is born
prematurely, is unwanted, or has physical problems that make him or her more challenging to
parent. Under these circumstances, we cannot assume that the parent is going to provide the
child with a feeling of trust.

Mary Ainsworth and the Strange Situation
Developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth, a student of John Bowlby, continued studying the
development of attachment in infants. Ainsworth and her colleagues created a laboratory test
that measured an infant’s attachment to his or her parent. The test is called The Strange
Situation because it is conducted in a context that is unfamiliar to the child and therefore likely
to heighten the child’s need for his or her parent (Ainsworth, 1979).

Figure 6.12 – An infant crawling on the floor with toys around as done in the Strange Situation.20

During the procedure, which lasts about 20 minutes, the parent and the infant are first left
alone, while the infant explores the room full of toys. Then a strange adult enters the room and
talks for a minute to the parent, after which the parent leaves the room. The stranger stays
with the infant for a few minutes, and then the parent again enters and the stranger leaves the
room. During the entire session, a video camera records the child’s behaviors, which are later
coded by the research team. The investigators were especially interested in how the child
responded to the caregiver leaving and returning to the room, referred to as the “reunion.” On
the basis of their behaviors, the children are categorized into one of four groups where each
group reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver. One style is secure
and the other three styles are referred to as insecure.
 A child with a secure attachment style usually explores freely while the caregiver is
present and may engage with the stranger. The child will typically play with the toys and
bring one to the caregiver to show and describe from time to time. The child may be
upset when the caregiver departs, but is also happy to see the caregiver return.
 A child with an ambivalent (sometimes called resistant) attachment style is wary about
the situation in general, particularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the
caregiver rather than exploring the toys. When the caregiver leaves, the child is
extremely distressed and is ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The child may rush
to the caregiver, but then fails to be comforted when picked up. The child may still be
angry and even resist attempts to be soothed.





A child with an avoidant attachment style will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little
emotion when the mother departs or returns. The child may run away from the mother
when she approaches. The child will not explore very much, regardless of who is there,
and the stranger will not be treated much differently from the mother.
A child with a disorganized/disoriented attachment style seems to have an inconsistent
way of coping with the stress of the strange situation. The child may cry during the
separation, but avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the
mother but then freeze or fall to the floor.

How common are the attachment styles among children in the United States? It is estimated
that about 65 percent of children in the United States are securely attached. Twenty percent
exhibit avoidant styles and 10 to 15 percent are ambivalent. Another 5 to 10 percent may be
characterized as disorganized.
Some cultural differences in attachment styles have been found (Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott,
Miyake, & Morelli, 2010). For example, German parents value independence and Japanese
mothers are typically by their children’s sides. As a result, the rate of insecure-avoidant
attachments is higher in Germany and insecure-resistant attachments are higher in Japan.
These differences reflect cultural variation rather than true insecurity, however (van Ijzendoorn
and Sagi, 1999).
Keep in mind that methods for measuring attachment styles have been based on a model that
reflects middle-class, U. S. values and interpretation. Newer methods for assessment
attachment styles involve using a Q-sort technique in which a large number of behaviors are
recorded on cards and the observer sorts the cards in a way that reflects the type of behavior
that occurs within the situation (Waters, 1987). There are 90 items in the third version of the Qsort technique, and examples of the behaviors assessed include:
 When child returns to mother after playing, the child is sometimes fussy for no clear
reason.
 When the child is upset or injured, the child will accept comforting from adults other
than mother.
 Child often hugs or cuddles against mother, without her asking or inviting the child to do
so.
 When the child is upset by mother’s leaving, the child continues to cry or even gets
angry after she is gone.
At least two researchers observe the child and parent in the home for 1.5-2 hours per visit.
Usually two visits are sufficient to gather adequate information. The parent is asked if the
behaviors observed are typical for the child. This information is used to test the validity of the
Strange Situation classifications across age, cultures, and with clinical populations.

Caregiver Consistency
Having a consistent caregiver may be jeopardized if the infant is cared for in a child care setting
with a high turnover of staff or if institutionalized and given little more than basic physical care.
160 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Infants who, perhaps because of being in orphanages with inadequate care, have not had the
opportunity to attach in infancy may still form initial secure attachments several years later.
However, they may have more emotional problems of depression, anger, or be overly friendly
as they interact with others (O’Connor et. al., 2003).

Social Deprivation
Severe deprivation of parental attachment can lead to serious problems. According to studies
of children who have not been given warm, nurturing care, they may show developmental
delays, failure to thrive, and attachment disorders (Bowlby, 1982). Non-organic failure to thrive
is the diagnosis for an infant who does not grow, develop, or gain weight on schedule. In
addition, postpartum depression can cause even a well-intentioned mother to neglect her
infant.

Figure 6.13 - This is a residential nursery in 1888.21

Reactive Attachment Disorder
Children who experience social neglect or deprivation, repeatedly change primary caregivers
that limit opportunities to form stable attachments, or are reared in unusual settings (such as
institutions) that limit opportunities to form stable attachments can certainly have difficulty
forming attachments. According to the Diagnostic and Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 th edition
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013), those children experiencing neglectful situations and
also displaying markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate attachment behavior,
such as being inhibited and withdrawn, minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others,
and limited positive affect, may be diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder. This disorder
often occurs with developmental delays, especially in cognitive and language areas.
Fortunately, the majority of severely neglected children do not develop Reactive Attachment
Disorder, which occurs in less than 10% of such children. The quality of the caregiving
environment after serious neglect affects the development of this disorder.

Resiliency
Being able to overcome challenges and successfully adapt is resiliency. Even young children can
exhibit strong resilience to harsh circumstances. Resiliency can be attributed to certain
personality factors, such as an easy-going temperament. Some children are warm, friendly, and
responsive, whereas others tend to be more irritable, less manageable, and difficult to console,
and these differences play a role in attachment (Gillath, Shaver, Baek, & Chun, 2008; Seifer,
Schiller, Sameroff, Resnick, & Riordan, 1996). It seems safe to say that attachment, like most
other developmental processes, is affected by an inter play of genetic and socialization
influences.
Receiving support from others also leads to resiliency. A positive and strong support group can
help a parent and child build a strong foundation by offering assistance and positive attitudes
toward the newborn and parent. In a direct test of this idea, Dutch researcher van den Boom
(1994) randomly assigned some babies’ mothers to a training session in which they learned to
better respond to their children’s needs. The research found that these mothers’ babies were
more likely to show a secure attachment style in comparison to the mothers in a control group
that did not receive training.22

Figure 6.14 - This infant massage class for new mothers could provide training and support for mothers.23

Child Care
According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2011, over sixty percent of families with children under
five relied on regular child care arrangements. Around a quarter of those families used
organized child care facilities as their primary arrangement.24
Child care involves supervising a child or children, usually from infancy to age thirteen, and
typically refers to work done by somebody outside the child's immediate family. Child care is a

broad topic covering a wide spectrum of contexts, activities, social and cultural conventions,
and institutions. The majority of child care institutions that are available require that child care
providers have extensive training in first aid and are CPR certified. In addition, background
checks, drug testing, and reference verification are normally required.
It is traditional in Western society for children to be cared for by their parents or their legal
guardians. In families where children live with one or both of their parents, the child care role
may also be taken on by the child's extended family. If a parent or extended family is unable to
care for the children, orphanages and foster homes are a way of providing for children's care,
housing, and schooling.

Child Care in the United States
Formal child care options include center-based care and family child care homes. Each state
has different regulations for licensing child care centers, including teacher requirements. In
some states, teaching in a child care center requires an associate’s degree in child
development. States with quality standards built into their licensing programs may have higher
requirements for support staff, such as teacher assistants. Head Start (a federally funded child
care program for income qualified families) lead teachers must have a bachelor’s degree in
Early Childhood Education. States vary in other standards set for daycare providers, such as
teacher to child ratios.

Figure 6.15 – A caretaker reading to an infant.25

State legislation may regulate the number and ages of children allowed before the home is
considered an official family child care program and subject to licensing regulations. Often the
nationally recognized Child Development Associate credential is the minimum standard for the
individual leading this home care program.

Figure 6.16 – A caretaker playing with a group of children.26

In addition to these licensed options, parents may also choose to find their own caregiver or
arrange childcare exchanges/swaps with another family. This care is typically provided by
nannies, au pairs, or friends and family. The child is watched inside their own home or the
caregiver's home, reducing exposure to outside children and illnesses. Depending on the
number of children in the home, the children utilizing in-home care can enjoy the greatest
amount of interaction with their caregiver and form a close bond.
There are no required licensing or background checks for this type of in-home care, making
parental vigilance essential in choosing an appropriate caregiver. The cost of in-home care is
the highest of childcare options per child, though a household with many children may find this
the most convenient and affordable option.27

Introduction
During the early childhood years of three to five we see significant changes in the way children
look, think, communicate, regulate their emotions, and interact with others. Children are often
referred to as preschoolers during this time period. We’ll examine the physical changes of the
preschooler in this chapter.

Figure 7.1 – Two children walking across a bridge.1

Growth in Early Childhood
Children between the ages of 2 and 6 years tend to grow about 3 inches in height each year and
gain about 4 to 5 pounds in weight each year. The 3 year old is very similar to a toddler with a
1

large head, large stomach, short arms and legs. But by the time the child reaches age 6, the
torso has lengthened and body proportions have become more like those of adults. The
average 6 year old weighs approximately 46 pounds and is about 46 inches in height. This
growth rate is slower than that of infancy.

Nutritional Concerns
That slower rate of growth is accompanied by a reduced appetite between the ages of 2 and 6.
This change can sometimes be surprising to parents and lead to the development of poor
eating habits. However, children between the ages of 2 and 3 need 1,000 to 1,400 calories,
while children between the ages of 4 and 8 need 1,200 to 2,000 calories (Mayo Clinic, 2016a).2
Caregivers who have established a feeding routine with their child can find the reduction in
appetite a bit frustrating and become concerned that the child is going to starve. However, by
providing adequate, sound nutrition, and limiting sugary snacks and drinks, the caregiver can be
assured that 1) the child will not starve; and 2) the child will receive adequate nutrition.
Preschoolers can experience iron deficiencies if not given well-balanced nutrition or if they are
given too much milk as calcium interferes with the absorption of iron in the diet as well.
Caregivers need to keep in mind that they are setting up taste preferences at this age. Young
children who grow accustomed to high fat, very sweet and salty flavors may have trouble eating
foods that have more subtle flavors such as fruits and vegetables. Consider the following advice
about establishing eating patterns for years to come (Rice, F.P., 1997). Notice that keeping
mealtime pleasant, providing sound nutrition and not engaging in power struggles over food
are the main goals.3

Tips for Establishing Healthy Eating Habits
1.

3.

Don’t try to force your child to eat or fight over food. Of course, it is impossible to
force someone to eat. But the real advice here is to avoid turning food into a power
struggle so that food doesn’t become a way to gain favor with or express anger
toward someone else.
Recognize that appetite varies. Children may eat well at one meal and have no
appetite at another. Rather than seeing this as a problem, it may help to realize that
appetites do vary. Continue to provide good nutrition at each mealtime (even if
children don’t choose to eat the occasional meal).
Keep it pleasant. This tip is designed to help caregivers create a positive atmosphere
during mealtime. Mealtimes should not be the time for arguments or expressing
tensions. You do not want the child to have painful memories of mealtimes together
or have nervous stomachs and problems eating and digesting food due to stress.

No short order chefs. While it is fine to prepare foods that children enjoy, preparing
a different meal for each child or family member sets up an unrealistic expectation
from others. Children probably do best when they are hungry and a meal is ready.
Limiting snacks rather than allowing children to “graze” continuously can help create
an appetite for whatever is being served.
Limit choices. If you give your preschool aged child choices, make sure that you give
them one or two specific choices rather than asking “What would you like for
lunch?” If given an open choice, children may change their minds or choose
whatever their sibling does not choose!
Serve balanced meals. Meals prepared at home tend to have better nutritional
value than fast food or frozen dinners. Prepared foods tend to be higher in fat and
sugar content as these ingredients enhance taste and profit margin because fresh
food is often more costly and less profitable. However, preparing fresh food at home
is not costly. It does, however, require more activity. Including children in meal
preparation can provide a fun and memorable experience.
Don’t bribe. Bribing a child to eat vegetables by promising dessert is not a good
idea. First, the child will likely find a way to get the dessert without eating the
vegetables (by whining or fidgeting, perhaps, until the caregiver gives in). Secondly,
it teaches the child that some foods are better than others. Children tend to
naturally enjoy a variety of foods until they are taught that some are considered less
desirable than others. A child, for example, may learn the broccoli they have enjoyed
is seen as yucky by others unless it’s smothered in cheese sauce!4

Brain Maturation
Brain Weight
The brain is about 75 percent its adult weight by two years of age. By age 6, it is approximately
95 percent its adult weight. Myelination and the development of dendrites continues to occur
in the cortex and as it does, we see a corresponding change in the child’s abilities. Significant
development in the prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain behind the forehead that helps us
to think, strategize, and control emotion) makes it increasingly possible to control emotional
outbursts and to understand how to play games. Consider 4- or 5-year-old children and how
they might approach a game of soccer. Chances are, every move would be a response to the
commands of a coach standing nearby calling out, “Run this way! Now, stop. Look at the
ball. Kick the ball!” And when the child is not being told what to do, he or she is likely to be
looking at the clover on the ground or a dog on the other side of the fence! Understanding the
game, thinking ahead, coordinating movement, and handling losing improve with practice and
myelination.7

Visual Pathways
Children’s drawings are representative of the development of visual pathways; as children’s
brains mature the images in their drawings change. Early scribbles and dots illustrate the use of
simple motor skills. No real connection is made between an image being visualized and what is
created on paper.
At age 3, the child begins to draw wispy creatures with heads and not much other
detail. Gradually pictures begin to have more detail and incorporate more parts of the
body. Arm buds become arms and faces take on noses, lips and eventually eyelashes.

Figure 7.5 – A detailed face.10

Growth in the Hemispheres and Corpus Callosum
Between ages 3 and 6, the left hemisphere of the brain grows dramatically. This side of the
brain or hemisphere is typically involved in language skills. The right hemisphere continues to
grow throughout early childhood and is involved in tasks that require spatial skills such as
recognizing shapes and patterns. The corpus callosum which connects the two hemispheres of
the brain undergoes a growth spurt between ages 3 and 6 and results in improved coordination
between right and left hemisphere tasks.

Motor Skill Development
Early childhood is a time when children are especially attracted to motion and song. Days are
filled with jumping, running, swinging and clapping and every place becomes a playground.
Even the booth at a restaurant affords the opportunity to slide around in the seat or disappear
underneath and imagine being a sea creature in a cave! Of course, this can be frustrating to a
caregiver, but it’s the business of early childhood.

Gross Motor Skills
Children continue to improve their gross motor skills as they run and jump. They frequently ask
their caregivers to “look at me” while they hop or roll down a hill. Children’s songs are often
accompanied by arm and leg movements or cues to turn around or move from left to right.

Gross Motor Milestones
Here is a table showing the progression of gross motor skills that children will typically develop
during early childhood:

Fine Motor Skills
Fine motor skills are also being refined as they continue to develop more dexterity, strength,
and endurance. Fine motor skills are very important as they are foundational to self-help skills
and later academic abilities (such as writing).

Sleep and Early Childhood
Along with food and water, sleep is one of the human body's most important physiological
needs—we cannot live without it. Extended sleeplessness (i.e., lack of sleep for longer than a
few days) has severe psychological and physical effects. Research on rats has found that a week
of no sleep leads to loss of immune function, and two weeks of no sleep leads to death.
Recently, neuroscientists have learned that at least one vital function of sleep is related to
learning and memory. New findings suggest that sleep plays a critical role in flagging and
storing important memories, both intellectual and physical, and perhaps in making subtle
connections that were invisible during waking hours.15

How Much Sleep Do We Need?
The amount of sleep an individual needs varies depending on multiple factors including age,
physical condition, psychological condition, and energy exertion. Just like any other human
characteristic, the amount of sleep people need to function best differs among individuals,
even those of the same age and gender.
Though there is no magic sleep number, there are general rules for how much sleep certain age
groups need. For instance, children need more sleep per day in order to develop and function
properly: up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as a child ages. A newborn
baby spends almost 9 hours a day in REM sleep. By the age of five, only slightly over two hours
is spent in REM. Studies show that young children need about 10 to 11 hours of sleep,
adolescents need between 8.5 and 9.25, and adults generally need between 7 and 9 hours.

Figure 7.8 – A child sleeping.16

Sleepwalking (Somnambulism)
Sleepwalking (sometimes called sleepwalking disorder, somnambulism, or noctambulation)
causes a person to get up and walk during the early hours of sleep. The person may sit up and
look awake (though they're actually asleep), get up and walk around, move items, or dress or

undress themselves. They will have a blank stare and still be able to perform complex tasks.
Some individuals also talk while in their sleep, saying meaningless words and even having
arguments with people who are not there. A person who sleepwalks will be confused upon
waking up and may also experience anxiety and fatigue.
Sleepwalking can be dangerous—people have been known to seriously hurt themselves during
sleepwalking episodes. It is most common in children, but it also occurs occasionally in adults.
For adults, alcohol, sedatives, medications, medical conditions and mental disorders are all
associated with sleepwalking.

Sleep Terrors and Nightmare Disorder
Sleep terrors are characterized by a sudden arousal from deep sleep with a scream or cry,
accompanied by some behavioral manifestations of intense fear. Sleep terrors typically occur in
the first few hours of sleep, during stage 3 NREM sleep. Night terrors tend to happen during
periods of arousal from delta sleep (i.e., slow-wave sleep). They are worse than nightmares,
causing significant disorientation, panic, and anxiety. They can last up to 10 minutes, and the
person may be screaming and difficult to wake. In some cases, sleep terrors continue into
adulthood.
Distinct from sleep terrors is nightmare disorder. Also known as "dream anxiety disorder,"
nightmare disorder is characterized by frequent nightmares. The nightmares, which often
portray the individual in a situation that jeopardizes their life or personal safety, usually occur
during the second half of the sleeping process, called the REM stage. Though many people
experience nightmares, those with nightmare disorder experience them more frequently.17

Toilet Training
Toilet training typically occurs after the second birthday. Some children show interest by age 2,
but others may not be ready until months later. The average age for girls to be toilet trained is
29 months and for boys it is 31 months, and 98% of children are trained by 36 months (Boyse &
Fitzgerald, 2010). The child’s age is not as important as his/her physical and emotional
readiness. If started too early, it might take longer to train a child.
According to The Mayo Clinic (2016b) the following questions can help parents determine if a
child is ready for toilet training:
 Does your child seem interested in the potty chair or toilet, or in wearing underwear?
 Can your child understand and follow basic directions?
 Does your child tell you through words, facial expressions or posture when he or she
needs to go?
 Does your child stay dry for periods of two hours or longer during the day?
 Does your child complain about wet or dirty diapers?
 Can your child pull down his or her pants and pull them up again?



Can your child sit on and rise from a potty chair?

If a child resists being trained or it is not successful after a few weeks, it is best to take a break
and try again when they show more significant interest in the process. Most children master
daytime bladder control first, typically within two to three months of consistent toilet training.
However, nap and nighttime training might take months or even years.

Figure 7.9 – A child learning to be toilet trained.18

Elimination Disorders
Some children experience elimination disorders including:
 enuresis - the repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (involuntary or intentional)
after age 5
 encopresis - the repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (involuntary or
intentional).
The prevalence of enuresis is 5%-10% for 5 year-olds, 3%-5% for 10 year-olds and
approximately 1% for those 15 years of age or older. Around 1% of 5 year- olds have
encopresis, and it is more common in males than females. These are diagnosed by a medical
professional and may require treatment.19

Sexual Development in Early Childhood
Self-stimulation is common in early childhood for both boys and girls. Curiosity about the body
and about others’ bodies is a natural part of early childhood as well. Consider this example. A
girl asks her mother: “So it’s okay to see a boy’s privates as long as it’s the boy’s mother or a
doctor?” The mother hesitates a bit and then responds, “Yes. I think that’s alright.” “Hmmm,”

the girl begins, “When I grow up, I want to be a doctor!” While this subject can feel
uncomfortable to deal with, caregivers can teach children to be safe and know what is
appropriate without frightening them or causing shame.
As children grow, they are more likely to show their genitals to siblings or peers, and to take off
their clothes and touch each other (Okami et al., 1997). Masturbation is common for both boys
and girls. Boys are often shown by other boys how to masturbate. But girls tend to find out
accidentally. And boys masturbate more often and touch themselves more openly than do girls
(Schwartz, 1999).
Caregivers should respond to this without undue alarm and without making the child feel guilty
about their bodies. Instead, messages about what is going on and the appropriate time and
place for such activities help the child learn what is appropriate.20

Health in Early Childhood
While preschoolers are becoming more and more independent, they depend on their
caregivers to keep protecting and promoting their health. 21

Childhood Obesity
Childhood obesity is a complex health issue. It occurs when a child is well above the normal or
healthy weight for his or her age and height. Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the
United States putting children at risk for poor health. In 2015-2016, 13.9% of 2- to 5-year-olds
were obese.
Where people live can affect their ability to make healthy choices. Obesity disproportionally
affects children from low-income families.

Causes of Obesity
The causes of excess weight gain in young people are similar to those in adults, including factors
such as a person’s behavior and genetics. Behaviors that influence excess weight gain include:
 eating high calorie, low-nutrient foods
 not getting enough physical exercise
 sedentary activities (such as watching television or other screen devices)
 medication use
 sleep routines

Consequences of Obesity
The consequences of childhood obesity are both immediate and long term. It can affect
physical as well as social and emotional well-being.
 More Immediate Health Risks
o High blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are risk factors for
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
o Increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2
diabetes.
o Breathing problems, such as asthma and sleep apnea.
o Joint problems and musculoskeletal discomfort.
o Fatty liver disease, gallstones, and gastro-esophageal reflux (i.e., heartburn).
 Childhood obesity is also related to
o Psychological problems such as anxiety and depression.
o Low self-esteem and lower self-reported quality of life.
o Social problems such as bullying and stigma.
 Future Health Risks
o Children who have obesity are more likely to become adults with obesity.11 Adult
obesity is associated with increased risk of a number of serious health conditions
including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.
o If children have obesity, their obesity and disease risk factors in adulthood are
likely to be more severe.23

Food Allergies
A food allergy occurs when the body has a specific and reproducible immune response to
certain foods. The body’s immune response can be severe and life threatening, such as

anaphylaxis. Although the immune system normally protects people from germs, in people with
food allergies, the immune system mistakenly responds to food as if it were harmful.
Eight foods or food groups account for 90% of serious allergic reactions in the United States:
milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts.
The symptoms and severity of allergic reactions to food can be different between individuals,
and can also be different for one person over time. Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic
reaction that may cause death.4Not all allergic reactions will develop into anaphylaxis.
 Children with food allergies are two to four times more likely to have asthma or other
allergic conditions than those without food allergies.
 The prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18% during 1997-2007, and
allergic reactions to foods have become the most common cause of anaphylaxis in
community health settings.
 Although difficult to measure, research suggests that approximately 4% of children and
adolescents are affected by food allergies.
The CDC recommends that as part of maintaining a healthy and safe environment for children,
caregivers should:
 Be aware of any food allergies.
 Educate other children and all adults that care for a child with food allergies.
 Ensure the daily management of food allergies.
 Prepare for food allergy emergencies.24

Oral Health
Tooth decay (cavities) is one of the most common chronic conditions of childhood in the United
States. Untreated tooth decay can cause pain and infections that may lead to problems with
eating, speaking, playing, and learning. The good news is that tooth decay is preventable.
Fluoride varnish, a high concentration fluoride coating that is painted on teeth, can prevent
about one-third (33%) of decay in the primary (baby) teeth. Children living in communities with
fluoridated tap water have fewer decayed teeth than children who live in areas where their tap
water is not fluoridated. Similarly, children who brush daily with fluoride toothpaste will have
less tooth decay.
Applying dental sealants to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth is another way to prevent
tooth decay. Studies in children show that sealants reduce decay in the permanent molars by
81% for 2 years after they are placed on the tooth and continue to be effective for 4 years after
placement.25

The first visit to the dentist should happen after the first tooth erupts. After that, children
should be seeing the dentist every six months.26

Protection from Illness
Two important ways to help protect children from illness are immunization and handwashing.

Immunizations
While vaccines begin in infancy, it is important for children to receive additional doses of
vaccines to keep them protected. These boosters, given between ages 4 and 6, are doses of the
vaccines they received earlier in life to help them maintain the best protection against vaccinepreventable diseases.

Figure 7.12 – Vaccines.28

Many states require children to be fully vaccinated (unless they have a medical reason to be
exempt) before they can enroll in licensed child care or public school. If vaccinations were

missed, a health care provider can help the child’s caregivers to create a catch up schedule to
ensure the child correctly “catches up” with the recommended childhood vaccination
schedule.29

Handwashing
Handwashing is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of illness. It’s important for children
(and adults) to wash their hands often, especially when they are likely to get and spread germs,
including:
 Before, during, and after preparing food.
 Before eating food.
 After blowing nose, coughing, or sneezing.
 After using the toilet.
 After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
 After touching garbage.
It’s important for children to learn how to properly wash their hands. When washing hands
children (and adults) should follow these five steps every time.
1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply
soap.
2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your
hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
3. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum or sing the Happy Birthday
song or ABCs from beginning to end twice.
4. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
5. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.30

Caregivers can help keep children healthy by:
 Teaching them good handwashing techniques.
 Reminding their kids to wash their hands.
 Washing their own hands with the children.32

Safety
Child injuries are preventable, yet more than 9,000 children (from 0-19 years) died from injuries
in the US in 2009. Car crashes, suffocation, drowning, poisoning, fires, and falls are some of the
most common ways children are hurt or killed. The number of children dying from injury
dropped nearly 30% over the last decade. However, injury is still the number 1 cause of death
among children.33
Children during early childhood are more at risk for certain injuries. Using data from 2000-2006,
the CDC determined that:
 Drowning was the leading cause of injury death between 1 and 4 years of age.
 Falls were the leading cause of nonfatal injury for all age groups less than 15.
 For children ages 0 to 9, the next two leading causes were being struck by or against an
object and animal bites or insect stings.
 Rates for fires or burns, and drowning were highest for children 4 years and younger. 34
Here is a table summarizing some tips from the CDC to protect children from these injuries:

Chapter 8: Cognitive Development in Early
Childhood
Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Compare and contrast Piaget and Vygotsky’s beliefs about cognitive development.
2. Explain the role of information processing in cognitive development.
3. Discuss how preschool-aged children understand their worlds.
4. Put cognitive and language milestones into the order in which they appear in typically
developing children.
5. Discuss how early child education supports development and how our understanding of
development influence education.
6. Describe autism spectrum disorder, including characteristics and possible interventions.

Introduction
Early childhood is a time of pretending, blending fact and fiction, and learning to think of the
world using language. As young children move away from needing to touch, feel, and hear
about the world toward learning some basic principles about how the world works, they hold
some pretty interesting initial ideas. For example, while adults have no concerns with taking a
bath, a child of three might genuinely worry about being sucked down the drain.1

Figure 8.1 – A child in a bathtub.2

A child might protest if told that something will happen “tomorrow” but be willing to accept an
explanation that an event will occur “today after we sleep.” Or the young child may ask, “How

long are we staying? From here to here?” while pointing to two points on a table. Concepts
such as tomorrow, time, size and distance are not easy to grasp at this young
age. Understanding size, time, distance, fact and fiction are all tasks that are part of cognitive
development in the preschool years.3

Piaget’s Preoperational Intelligence
Piaget’s stage that coincides with early childhood is the preoperational stage. The word
operational means logical, so these children were thought to be illogical. However, they were
learning to use language or to think of the world symbolically. Let’s examine some of Piaget’s
assertions about children’s cognitive abilities at this age.

Pretend Play
Pretending is a favorite activity at this time. A toy has qualities beyond the way it was designed
to function and can now be used to stand for a character or object unlike anything originally
intended. A teddy bear, for example, can be a baby or the queen of a faraway land!

Figure 8.2 – A child pretending to buy items at a toy grocery store. 4

According to Piaget, children’s pretend play helps them solidify new schemes they were
developing cognitively. This play, then, reflects changes in their conceptions or
thoughts. However, children also learn as they pretend and experiment. Their play does not
simply represent what they have learned (Berk, 2007).

Egocentrism
Egocentrism in early childhood refers to the tendency of young children to think that everyone
sees things in the same way as the child. Piaget’s classic experiment on egocentrism involved
showing children a 3-dimensional model of a mountain and asking them to describe what a doll
that is looking at the mountain from a different angle might see. Children tend to choose a

picture that represents their own view, rather than that of the doll. However, children tend to
use different sentence structures and vocabulary when addressing a younger child or an older
adult. This indicates some awareness of the views of others.

Figure 8.3 – Piaget’s egocentrism experiment.5

Syncretism
Syncretism refers to a tendency to think that if two events occur simultaneously, one caused
the other. An example of this is a child putting on their bathing suit to turn it to summertime.

Animism
Attributing lifelike qualities to objects is referred to as animism. The cup is alive, the chair that
falls down and hits the child’s ankle is mean, and the toys need to stay home because they are
tired. Cartoons frequently show objects that appear alive and take on lifelike qualities. Young
children do seem to think that objects that move may be alive but after age 3, they seldom
refer to objects as being alive (Berk, 2007).

Classification Errors
Preoperational children have difficulty understanding that an object can be classified in more
than one way. For example, if shown three white buttons and four black buttons and asked
whether there are more black buttons or buttons, the child is likely to respond that there are
more black buttons. As the child’s vocabulary improves and more schemes are developed, the
ability to classify objects improves.6

Conservation Errors
Conservation refers to the ability to recognize that moving or rearranging matter does not
change the quantity. Let’s look at an example. A father gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko
and another slice to 3-year-old Kenny. Kenny’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told
his sister that he got more pizza than she did. Kenny did not understand that cutting the pizza
into smaller pieces did not increase the overall amount. This was because Kenny exhibited
Centration, or focused on only one characteristic of an object to the exclusion of others.
Kenny focused on the five pieces of pizza to his sister’s one piece even though the total amount
was the same. Keiko was able to consider several characteristics of an object than just one.
Because children have not developed this understanding of conservation, they cannot perform
mental operations.
The classic Piagetian experiment associated with conservation involves liquid (Crain, 2005). As
seen below, the child is shown two glasses (as shown in a) which are filled to the same level and
asked if they have the same amount. Usually the child agrees they have the same amount. The
researcher then pours the liquid from one glass to a taller and thinner glass (as shown in b). The
child is again asked if the two glasses have the same amount of liquid. The preoperational child
will typically say the taller glass now has more liquid because it is taller. The child has
concentrated on the height of the glass and fails to conserve.7

Figure 8.4 – Piagetian liquid conservation experiments.8

Cognitive Schemas
As introduced in the first chapter, Piaget believed that in a quest for cognitive equilibrium, we
use schemas (categories of knowledge) to make sense of the world. And when new experiences
fit into existing schemas, we use assimilation to add that new knowledge to the schema. But
when new experiences do not match an existing schema, we use accommodation to add a new
schema. During early childhood, children use accommodation often as they build their
understanding of the world around them.

Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory of Cognitive Development
As introduced in Chapter 1, Lev Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist who argued that culture
has a major impact on a child’s cognitive development. He believed that the social interactions
with adults and more knowledgeable peers can facilitate a child’s potential for learning.
Without this interpersonal instruction, he believed children’s minds would not advance very far
as their knowledge would be based only on their own discoveries. Let’s review some of
Vygotsky’s key concepts.

Zone of Proximal Development and Scaffolding
Vygotsky’s best known concept is the zone of proximal development (ZPD). Vygotsky stated
that children should be taught in the ZPD, which occurs when they can perform a task with
assistance, but not quite yet on their own. With the right kind of teaching, however, they can
accomplish it successfully. A good teacher identifies a child’s ZPD and helps the child stretch
beyond it. Then the adult (teacher) gradually withdraws support until the child can then
perform the task unaided. Researchers have applied the metaphor of scaffolds (the temporary
platforms on which construction workers stand) to this way of teaching. Scaffolding is the
temporary support that parents or teachers give a child to do a task.

Figure 8.5 – Zone of proximal development.9

Private Speech
Do you ever talk to yourself? Why? Chances are, this occurs when you are struggling with a
problem, trying to remember something, or feel very emotional about a situation. Children talk
to themselves too. Piaget interpreted this as egocentric speech or a practice engaged in
because of a child’s inability to see things from another’s point of view. Vygotsky, however,
believed that children talk to themselves in order to solve problems or clarify thoughts. As

children learn to think in words, they do so aloud before eventually closing their lips and
engaging in private speech or inner speech.
Thinking out loud eventually becomes thought accompanied by internal speech, and talking to
oneself becomes a practice only engaged in when we are trying to learn something or
remember something. This inner speech is not as elaborate as the speech we use when
communicating with others (Vygotsky, 1962).10

Contrast with Piaget
Piaget was highly critical of teacher-directed instruction, believing that teachers who take
control of the child’s learning place the child into a passive role (Crain, 2005). Further, teachers
may present abstract ideas without the child’s true understanding, and instead they just repeat
back what they heard. Piaget believed children must be given opportunities to discover
concepts on their own. As previously stated, Vygotsky did not believe children could reach a
higher cognitive level without instruction from more learned individuals. Who is correct? Both
theories certainly contribute to our understanding of how children learn.

Information Processing
Information processing researchers have focused on several issues in cognitive development for
this age group, including improvements in attention skills, changes in the capacity, and the
emergence of executive functions in working memory. Additionally, in early childhood memory
strategies, memory accuracy, and autobiographical memory emerge. Early childhood is seen by
many researchers as a crucial time period in memory development (Posner & Rothbart, 2007).

Figure 8.6 – How information is processed.11

Attention
Changes in attention have been described by many as the key to changes in human memory
(Nelson & Fivush, 2004; Posner & Rothbart, 2007). However, attention is not a unified function;
it is comprised of sub-processes. The ability to switch our focus between tasks or external
stimuli is called divided attention or multitasking. This is separate from our ability to focus on a

single task or stimulus, while ignoring distracting information, called selective attention.
Different from these is sustained attention, or the ability to stay on task for long periods of
time. Moreover, we also have attention processes that influence our behavior and enable us to
inhibit a habitual or dominant response, and others that enable us to distract ourselves when
upset or frustrated.

Divided Attention
Young children (age 3-4) have considerable difficulties in dividing their attention between two
tasks, and often perform at levels equivalent to our closest relative, the chimpanzee, but by age
five they have surpassed the chimp (Hermann, Misch, Hernandez-Lloreda & Tomasello, 2015;
Hermann & Tomasello, 2015). Despite these improvements, 5-year-olds continue to perform
below the level of school-age children, adolescents, and adults.

Selective Attention
Children’s ability with selective attention tasks improve as they age. However, this ability is also
greatly influenced by the child’s temperament (Rothbart & Rueda, 2005), the complexity of the
stimulus or task (Porporino, Shore, Iarocci & Burack, 2004), and along with whether the stimuli
are visual or auditory (Guy, Rogers & Cornish, 2013). Guy et al. (2013) found that children’s
ability to selectively attend to visual information outpaced that of auditory stimuli. This may
explain why young children are not able to hear the voice of the teacher over the cacophony of
sounds in the typical preschool classroom (Jones, Moore & Amitay, 2015). Jones and his
colleagues found that 4 to 7 year-olds could not filter out background noise, especially when its
frequencies were close in sound to the target sound. In comparison, 8- to 11-year-old children
often performed similar to adults.

Figure 8.7 – A group of children making crafts.12

Sustained Attention
Most measures of sustained attention typically ask children to spend several minutes focusing
on one task, while waiting for an infrequent event, while there are multiple distractors for
12

several minutes. Berwid, Curko-Kera, Marks & Halperin (2005) asked children between the ages
of 3 and 7 to push a button whenever a “target” image was displayed, but they had to refrain
from pushing the button when a non-target image was shown. The younger the child, the more
difficulty he or she had maintaining their attention.

Figure 8.8 – A child playing a game that measures her sustained attention.13

Memory
Based on studies of adults, people with amnesia, and neurological research on memory,
researchers have proposed several “types” of memory (see Figure 4.14). Sensory memory (also
called the sensory register) is the first stage of the memory system, and it stores sensory input
in its raw form for a very brief duration; essentially long enough for the brain to register and
start processing the information. Studies of auditory sensory memory show that it lasts about
one second in 2 year-olds, two seconds in 3-year-olds, more than two seconds in 4-year-olds,
and three to five seconds in 6-year-olds (Glass, Sachse, & von Suchodoletz, 2008). Other
researchers have also found that young children hold sounds for a shorter duration than do
older children and adults, and that this deficit is not due to attentional differences between
these age groups, but reflects differences in the performance of the sensory memory system
(Gomes et al., 1999). The second stage of the memory system is called short-term or working
memory. Working memory is the component of memory in which current conscious mental
activity occurs.
Working memory often requires conscious effort and adequate use of attention to function
effectively. As you read earlier, children in this age group struggle with many aspects of
attention and this greatly diminishes their ability to consciously juggle several pieces of
information in memory. The capacity of working memory, that is the amount of information
someone can hold in consciousness, is smaller in young children than in older children and
adults. The typical adult and teenager can hold a 7 digit number active in their short-term
memory. The typical 5-year-old can hold only a 4 digit number active. This means that the more

13

complex a mental task is, the less efficient a younger child will be in paying attention to, and
actively processing, information in order to complete the task.

Figure 8.8 – A child thinking.14

Changes in attention and the working memory system also involve changes in executive
function. Executive function (EF) refers to self-regulatory processes, such as the ability to
inhibit a behavior or cognitive flexibility, that enable adaptive responses to new situations or to
reach a specific goal. Executive function skills gradually emerge during early childhood and
continue to develop throughout childhood and adolescence. Like many cognitive changes, brain
maturation, especially the prefrontal cortex, along with experience influence the development
of executive function skills.
A child shows higher executive functioning skills when the parents are more warm and
responsive, use scaffolding when the child is trying to solve a problem, and provide cognitively
stimulating environments for the child (Fay-Stammbach, Hawes & Meredith, 2014). For
instance, scaffolding was positively correlated with greater cognitive flexibility at age two and
inhibitory control at age four (Bibok, Carpendale & Müller, 2009). In Schneider, Kron-Sperl and
Hunnerkopf’s (2009) longitudinal study of 102 kindergarten children, the majority of children
used no strategy to remember information, a finding that was consistent with previous
research. As a result, their memory performance was poor when compared to their abilities as
they aged and started to use more effective memory strategies.
The third component in memory is long-term memory, which is also known as permanent
memory. A basic division of long-term memory is between declarative and non-declarative
memory.
 Declarative memories, sometimes referred to as explicit memories, are memories for
facts or events that we can consciously recollect. Declarative memory is further divided
into semantic and episodic memory.



o Semantic memories are memories for facts and knowledge that are not tied to a
timeline,
o Episodic memories are tied to specific events in time.
Non- declarative memories, sometimes referred to as implicit memories, are typically
automated skills that do not require conscious recollection.

Autobiographical memory is our personal narrative. Adults rarely remember events from the
first few years of life. In other words, we lack autobiographical memories from our experiences
as an infant, toddler and very young preschooler. Several factors contribute to the emergence
of autobiographical memory including brain maturation, improvements in language,
opportunities to talk about experiences with parents and others, the development of theory of
mind, and a representation of “self” (Nelson & Fivush, 2004). Two-year-olds do remember
fragments of personal experiences, but these are rarely coherent accounts of past events
(Nelson & Ross, 1980). Between 2 and 2 1⁄2 years of age children can provide more information
about past experiences. However, these recollections require considerable prodding by adults
(Nelson & Fivush, 2004). Over the next few years children will form more detailed
autobiographical memories and engage in more reflection of the past.

Neo-Piagetians
As previously discussed, Piaget’s theory has been criticized on many fronts, and updates to
reflect more current research have been provided by the Neo-Piagetians, or those theorists
who provide “new” interpretations of Piaget’s theory. Morra, Gobbo, Marini and Sheese (2008)
reviewed Neo-Piagetian theories, which were first presented in the 1970s, and identified how
these “new” theories combined Piagetian concepts with those found in Information Processing.
Similar to Piaget’s theory, Neo-Piagetian theories believe in constructivism, assume cognitive
development can be separated into different stages with qualitatively different characteristics,
and advocate that children’s thinking becomes more complex in advanced stages. Unlike Piaget,
Neo-Piagetians believe that aspects of information processing change the complexity of each
stage, not logic as determined by Piaget.
Neo-Piagetians propose that working memory capacity is affected by biological maturation, and
therefore restricts young children’s ability to acquire complex thinking and reasoning skills.
Increases in working memory performance and cognitive skills development coincide with the
timing of several neurodevelopmental processes. These include myelination, axonal and
synaptic pruning, changes in cerebral metabolism, and changes in brain activity (Morra et al.,
2008).
Myelination especially occurs in waves between birth and adolescence, and the degree of
myelination in particular areas explains the increasing efficiency of certain skills. Therefore,
brain maturation, which occurs in spurts, affects how and when cognitive skills develop.

193 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Additionally, all Neo-Piagetian theories support that experience and learning interact with
biological maturation in shaping cognitive development.15

Children’s Understanding of the World
Both Piaget and Vygotsky believed that children actively try to understand the world around
them. More recently developmentalists have added to this understanding by examining how
children organize information and develop their own theories about the world.

Theory-Theory
The tendency of children to generate theories to explain everything they encounter is called
theory-theory. This concept implies that humans are naturally inclined to find reasons and
generate explanations for why things occur. Children frequently ask question about what they
see or hear around them. When the answers provided do not satisfy their curiosity or are too
complicated for them to understand, they generate their own theories. In much the same way
that scientists construct and revise their theories, children do the same with their intuitions
about the world as they encounter new experiences (Gopnik & Wellman, 2012). One of the
theories they start to generate in early childhood centers on the mental states; both their own
and those of others.

Figure 8.9 - What theories might this boy be creating?16

Theory of Mind
Theory of mind refers to the ability to think about other people’s thoughts. This mental mind
reading helps humans to understand and predict the reactions of others, thus playing a crucial
role in social development. One common method for determining if a child has reached this
mental milestone is the false belief task, described below.

15

The research began with a clever experiment by Wimmer and Perner (1983), who tested
whether children can pass a false-belief test (see Figure 4.17). The child is shown a picture story
of Sally, who puts her ball in a basket and leaves the room. While Sally is out of the room, Anne
comes along and takes the ball from the basket and puts it inside a box. The child is then asked
where Sally thinks the ball is located when she comes back to the room. Is she going to look first
in the box or in the basket? The right answer is that she will look in the basket, because that’s
where she put it and thinks it is; but we have to infer this false belief against our own better
knowledge that the ball is in the box.

Figure 8.10 – A ball.17

Figure 8.11 – A basket.18

Figure 8.12 – A box.19

This is very difficult for children before the age of four because of the cognitive effort it takes.
Three-year-olds have difficulty distinguishing between what they once thought was true and
what they now know to be true. They feel confident that what they know now is what they
have always known (Birch & Bloom, 2003). Even adults need to think through this task (Epley,
Morewedge, & Keysar, 2004).
To be successful at solving this type of task the child must separate what he or she “knows” to
be true from what someone else might “think” is true. In Piagetian terms, they must give up a
tendency toward egocentrism. The child must also understand that what guides people’s
actions and responses are what they “believe” rather than what is reality. In other words,
people can mistakenly believe things that are false and will act based on this false knowledge.
Consequently, prior to age four children are rarely successful at solving such a task (Wellman,
Cross & Watson, 2001).
Researchers examining the development of theory of mind have been concerned by the
overemphasis on the mastery of false belief as the primary measure of whether a child has
attained theory of mind. Wellman and his colleagues (Wellman, Fang, Liu, Zhu & Liu, 2006)
suggest that theory of mind is comprised of a number of components, each with its own
developmental timeline (see Table 4.2).
Two-year-olds understand the diversity of desires, yet as noted earlier it is not until age four or
five that children grasp false belief, and often not until middle childhood do they understand

that people may hide how they really feel. In part, because children in early childhood have
difficulty hiding how they really feel.

Cultural Differences in Theory of Mind
Those in early childhood in the US, Australia, and Germany develop theory of mind in the
sequence outlined above. Yet, Chinese and Iranian preschoolers acquire knowledge access
before diverse beliefs (Shahaeian, Peterson, Slaughter & Wellman, 2011). Shahaeian and
colleagues suggested that cultural differences in childrearing may account for this reversal.
Parents in collectivistic cultures, such as China and Iran, emphasize conformity to the family
and cultural values, greater respect for elders, and the acquisition of knowledge and
academic skills more than they do autonomy and social skills (Frank, Plunkett & Otten, 2010).
This could reduce the degree of familial conflict of opinions expressed in the family. In
contrast, individualistic cultures encourage children to think for themselves and assert their
own opinion, and this could increase the risk of conflict in beliefs being expressed by family
members.

Figure 8.13 – A family from a non-Western culture.20

As a result, children in individualistic cultures would acquire insight into the question of
diversity of belief earlier, while children in collectivistic cultures would acquire knowledge
access earlier in the sequence. The role of conflict in aiding the development of theory of
mind may account for the earlier age of onset of an understanding of false belief in children
with siblings, especially older siblings (McAlister & Petersen, 2007; Perner, Ruffman &
Leekman, 1994).
This awareness of the existence of theory of mind is part of social intelligence, such as
recognizing that others can think differently about situations. It helps us to be self-conscious or
aware that others can think of us in different ways and it helps us to be able to be
20

understanding or be empathetic toward others. Moreover, this mind reading ability helps us to
anticipate and predict people’s actions. The awareness of the mental states of others is
important for communication and social skills.21

Milestones of Cognitive Development
The many theories of cognitive development and the different research that has been done
about how children understand the world, has allowed researchers to study the milestones that
children who are typically developing experience in early childhood. Here is a table that
summarizes those.

Language Development
Vocabulary Growth
A child’s vocabulary expands between the ages of 2 to 6 from about 200 words to over 10,000
words through a process called fast-mapping. Words are easily learned by making connections
between new words and concepts already known. The parts of speech that are learned depend
on the language and what is emphasized. Children speaking verb-friendly languages such as
Chinese and Japanese, tend to learn nouns more readily. But, those learning less verb-friendly
languages such as English, seem to need assistance in grammar to master the use of verbs
(Imai, et al, 2008).

Figure 8.14 – A woman instructing a girl on vocabulary.23

Literal Meanings
Children can repeat words and phrases after having heard them only once or twice. But they do
not always understand the meaning of the words or phrases. This is especially true of
expressions or figures of speech which are taken literally. For example, two preschool-aged girls
began to laugh loudly while listening to a tape-recording of Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty” when
the narrator reports, “Prince Phillip lost his head!” They imagine his head popping off and
rolling down the hill as he runs and searches for it. Or a classroom full of preschoolers hears the
teacher say, “Wow! That was a piece of cake!” The children began asking “Cake? Where is my
cake? I want cake!”

Overregularization
Children learn rules of grammar as they learn language but may apply these rules
inappropriately at first. For instance, a child learns to add “ed” to the end of a word to indicate
past tense. Then form a sentence such as “I goed there. I doed that.” This is typical at ages 2
and 3. They will soon learn new words such as “went” and “did” to be used in those situations.

The Impact of Training
Remember Vygotsky and the zone of proximal development? Children can be assisted in
learning language by others who listen attentively, model more accurate pronunciations and
encourage elaboration. The child exclaims, “I goed there!” and the adult responds, “You went
there? Say, ‘I went there.’ Where did you go?” Children may be ripe for language as Chomsky
suggests, but active participation in helping them learn is important for language development
as well. The process of scaffolding is one in which the adult (or more skilled peer) provides
needed assistance to the child as a new skill is learned.

Language Milestones
The prior aspects of language development in early childhood can also be summarized into the
progression of milestones children typically experience from ages 3 to 5. Here is a table of
those.

Now that we have addressed some of the cognitive areas of growth in early childhood, let’s
take a look at the topic of school and its various applications.

Early Childhood Education
Providing universal preschool has become an important lobbying point for federal, state, and
local leaders throughout our country. In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama
called upon congress to provide high quality preschool for all children. He continued to support
universal preschool in his legislative agenda, and in December 2014 the President convened
state and local policymakers for the White House Summit on Early Education (White House
Press Secretary, 2014).
However, universal preschool covering all four-year olds in the country would require
significant funding. Further, how effective preschools are in preparing children for elementary
school, and what constitutes high quality early childhood education have been debated.
To set criteria for designation as a high quality preschool, the National Association for the
Education of Young Children (NAEYC) identifies 10 standards (NAEYC, 2016). These include:

Positive relationships among all children and adults are promoted.
A curriculum that supports learning and development in social, emotional, physical,
language, and cognitive areas.
Teaching approaches that are developmentally, culturally and linguistically appropriate.
Assessment of children’s progress to provide information on learning and development.
The health and nutrition of children are promoted, while they are protected from illness
and injury.
Teachers possess the educational qualifications, knowledge, and commitment to
promote children’s learning.
Collaborative relationships with families are established and maintained.
Relationships with agencies and institutions in the children’s communities are
established to support the program’s goals.
The indoor and outdoor physical environments are safe and well-maintained.
Leadership and management personnel are well qualified, effective, and maintain
licensure status with the applicable state agency.

Parents should review preschool programs using the NAEYC criteria as a guide and template for
asking questions that will assist them in choosing the best program for their child.

Figure 8.15 – Children making crafts at preschool.25

Selecting the right preschool is also difficult because there are so many types of preschools
available. Zachry (2013) identified Montessori, Waldorf, Reggio Emilia, High Scope, Creative
Curriculum and Bank Street as types of early childhood education programs that focus on
children learning through discovery. Teachers act as facilitators of children’s learning and
development and create activities based on the child’s developmental level. Here is a table
summarizes characteristics of each type of program.

Head Start
For children who live in poverty, Head Start has been providing preschool education since
1965 when it was begun by President Lyndon Johnson as part of his war on poverty. It
currently serves nearly one million children and annually costs approximately 7.5 billion
dollars (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). However, concerns
about the effectiveness of Head Start have been ongoing since the program began. Armor
(2015) reviewed existing research on Head Start and found there were no lasting gains, and
the average child in Head Start had not learned more than children who did not receive
preschool education.

A recent report dated July 2015 evaluating the effectiveness of Head Start comes from the
What Works Clearinghouse. The What Works Clearinghouse identifies research that provides
reliable evidence of the effectiveness of programs and practices in education, and is
managed by the Institute of Education Services for the United States Department of
Education. After reviewing 90 studies on the effectiveness of Head Start, only one study was
deemed scientifically acceptable and this study showed disappointing results (Barshay, 2015).
This study showed that 3- and 4-year-old children in Head Start received “potentially positive
effects” on general reading achievement, but no noticeable effects on math achievement and
social-emotional development.
Nonexperimental designs are a significant problem in determining the effectiveness of Head
Start programs because a control group is needed to show group differences that would
demonstrate educational benefits. Because of ethical reasons, low income children are
usually provided with some type of pre-school programming in an alternative setting.
Additionally, Head Start programs are different depending on the location, and these
differences include the length of the day or qualification of the teachers. Lastly, testing young
children is difficult and strongly dependent on their language skills and comfort level with an
evaluator (Barshay, 2015).28

Applications to Early Education
Understanding how children think and learn has proven useful for improving education.
Activities like playing games that involve working with numbers and spatial relationships can
give young children a developmental advantage over peers who have less exposure to the same
concepts.

Mathematics
Even before they enter kindergarten, the mathematical knowledge of children from low-income
backgrounds lags far behind that of children from more affluent backgrounds. Ramani and
Siegler (2008) hypothesized that this difference is due to the children in middle- and upperincome families engaging more frequently in numerical activities, for example playing
numerical board games such as Chutes and Ladders. Chutes and Ladders is a game with a
number in each square; children start at the number one and spin a spinner or throw a dice to
determine how far to move their token. Playing this game seemed likely to teach children about
numbers, because in it, larger numbers are associated with greater values on a variety of
dimensions. In particular, the higher the number that a child’s token reaches, the greater the
distance the token will have traveled from the starting point, the greater the number of
physical movements the child will have made in moving the token from one square to another,
the greater the number of number-words the child will have said and heard, and the more time
will have passed since the beginning of the game. These spatial, kinesthetic, verbal, and timebased cues provide a broad-based, multisensory foundation for knowledge of numerical
magnitudes (the sizes of numbers), a type of knowledge that is closely related to mathematics
achievement test scores (Booth & Siegler, 2006).
Playing this numerical board game for roughly 1 hour, distributed over a 2-week period,
improved low-income children’s knowledge of numerical magnitudes, ability to read printed
numbers, and skill at learning novel arithmetic problems. The gains lasted for months after the
game-playing experience (Ramani & Siegler, 2008; Siegler & Ramani, 2009). An advantage of
this type of educational intervention is that it has minimal if any cost—a parent could just draw
a game on a piece of paper.

Reading
Cognitive developmental research has shown that phonemic awareness—that is, awareness of
the component sounds within words—is a crucial skill in learning to read. To measure
awareness of the component sounds within words, researchers ask children to decide whether
two words rhyme, to decide whether the words start with the same sound, to identify the
component sounds within words, and to indicate what would be left if a given sound were
removed from a word. Kindergartners’ performance on these tasks is the strongest predictor of
reading achievement in third and fourth grade, even stronger than IQ or social class background
(Nation, 2008). Moreover, teaching these skills to randomly chosen 4- and 5-year-olds results in
their being better readers years later (National Reading Panel, 2000).

Continuing Brain Maturation
Understanding of cognitive development is advancing on many different fronts. One exciting
area is linking changes in brain activity to changes in children’s thinking (Nelson et al., 2006).
Although many people believe that brain maturation is something that occurs before birth, the
brain actually continues to change in large ways for many years thereafter. For example, a part
of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which is located at the front of the brain and is
particularly involved with planning and flexible problem solving, continues to develop

204 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

throughout adolescence (Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006). Such new research domains, as well
as enduring issues such as nature and nurture, continuity and discontinuity, and how to apply
cognitive development research to education, insure that cognitive development will continue
to be an exciting area of research in the coming years.29

Cognitive Differences
Sometimes children’s brains work differently. One form of this neurodiversity is Autism
spectrum disorder.

Autism: Defining Spectrum Disorder
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) describes a range of conditions classified as neurodevelopmental disorders in the fifth revision of the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The DSM-5, published in 2013,
redefined the autism spectrum to encompass the previous (DSM-IV-TR) diagnoses of autism,
Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and
childhood disintegrative disorder. These disorders are characterized by social deficits and
communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and interests, sensory issues, and in some
cases, cognitive delays.
Asperger syndrome was distinguished from autism in the earlier DSM-IV by the lack of delay or
deviance in early language development. Additionally, individuals diagnosed with Asperger
syndrome did not have significant cognitive delays. PDD-NOS was considered "subthreshold
autism" and "atypical autism" because it was often characterized by milder symptoms of autism
or symptoms in only one domain (such as social difficulties). In the DSM-5, both of these
diagnoses have been subsumed into autism spectrum disorder.
Autism spectrum disorders are considered to be on a spectrum because each individual with
ASD expresses the disorder uniquely and has varying degrees of functionality. Many have
above-average intellectual abilities and excel in visual skills, music, math, and the arts, while
others have significant disabilities and are unable to live independently. About 25 percent of
individuals with ASD are nonverbal; however, they may learn to communicate using other
means.

Social Communication Symptoms
Social impairments in children with autism can be characterized by a distinctive lack of intuition
about others. Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Infants with
ASD show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less
to their own name. Toddlers with ASD differ more strikingly from social norms; for example,
they may show less eye contact and turn-taking and may not have the ability to use simple
movements to express themselves. Individuals with severe forms of ASD do not develop
enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.

Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors
Children with ASD may exhibit repetitive or restricted behavior, including:
 Stereotypy—repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
 Compulsive behavior—exhibiting intention to follow rules, such as arranging objects in
stacks or lines.
 Sameness—resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved
or sticking to an unvarying pattern of daily activities.
 Restricted behavior—limits in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a
single television program, toy, or game.
 Self-injury—movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye poking, skin
picking, hand biting, and head banging.

Etiology
While specific causes of ASD have yet to be found, many risk factors have been identified in the
research literature that may contribute to its development. These risk factors include genetics,
prenatal and perinatal factors, neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors. It is
possible to identify general risk factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific factors.

Genetics
ASD affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses
connect and organize; thus, it is categorized as a neuro-developmental disorder. The results of
family and twin studies suggest that genetic factors play a role in the etiology of ASD and other
pervasive developmental disorders. Studies have consistently found that the prevalence of ASD
in siblings of children with ASD is approximately 15 to 30 times greater than the rate in the
general population. In addition, research suggests that there is a much higher concordance rate
among monozygotic (identical) twins compared to dizygotic (fraternal) twins. It appears that
30

206 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

there is no single gene that can account for ASD; instead, there seem to be multiple genes
involved, each of which is a risk factor for part of the autism syndrome through various groups.
It is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations or by combinations of common
genetic variants.

The Diversity of the Autism Spectrum
The rainbow-colored infinity symbol represents the diversity of the autism spectrum as well as
the greater neurodiversity movement. The neurodiversity movement suggests that diverse
neurological conditions appear as a result of normal variations in the human genome. It
challenges the idea that such neurological differences are inherently pathological, instead
asserting that differences should be recognized and respected as a social category on a par with
gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability status.

Figure 8.18 – A symbol of the autism spectrum.31

Prenatal and Perinatal Factors
A number of prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors
for ASD. These risk factors include maternal gestational diabetes, maternal and paternal age
over 30, bleeding after first trimester, use of prescription medication (such as valproate) during
pregnancy, and meconium (the earliest stool of an infant) in the amniotic fluid. While research
is not conclusive on the relation of these factors to ASD, each of these factors has been
identified more frequently in children with ASD than in developing youth without ASD.

Environmental Factors
Evidence for environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies.
In the last few decades, controversy surrounded the idea that vaccinations may be the cause
for many cases of autism; however, these theories lack scientific evidence and are biologically
implausible. Even still, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to
lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases
in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

Treatment
There is no known cure for ASD, and treatment tends to focus on management of symptoms.
The main goals when treating children with ASD are to lessen associated deficits and family
distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence.32 Treatment for ASD should
begin as soon as possible after diagnosis. Early treatment for ASD is important as proper care
can reduce individuals’ difficulties while helping them learn new skills and make the most of
their strengths.
The wide range of issues facing people with ASD means that there is no single best treatment
for ASD.33 So treatment is typically tailored to the individual person's needs. Intensive,
sustained special-education programs and behavior therapy yearly in life can help children
acquire self-care, social, and job skills. The most widely used therapy is applied behavior
analysis (ABA); other available approaches include developmental models, structured teaching,
speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy.34

Figure 8.19 – A boy with ASD receiving therapy.35

There has been increasing attention to the development of evidenced-based interventions for
young children with ASD. Although evidence-based interventions for children with ASD vary in
their methods, many adopt a psychoeducational approach to enhancing cognitive,
communication, and social skills while minimizing behaviors that are thought to be
problematic.36

Many things influence how children develop those milestones as how they view themselves and
how they interact with those around them changes. Let’s look more at these.

Interactionism and Views of Self
Early childhood is a time of forming an initial sense of self. A self-concept or idea of who we
are, what we are capable of doing, and how we think and feel is a social process that involves
taking into consideration how others view us. So, in order to develop a sense of self, you must
have interaction with others. Interactionist theorists, Cooley and Mead offer two interesting
explanations of how a sense of self develops.

Cooley
Charles Horton Cooley (1964) suggests that our self-concept comes from looking at how others
respond to us. This process, known as the looking-glass self involves looking at how others
seem to view us and interpreting this as we make judgments about whether we are good or
bad, strong or weak, beautiful or ugly, and so on. Of course, we do not always interpret their
responses accurately so our self-concept is not simply a mirror reflection of the views of others.
After forming an initial self-concept, we may use it as a mental filter screening out those
responses that do not seem to fit our ideas of who we are. Some compliments may be negated,
for example. The process of the looking-glass self is pronounced when we are preschoolers, or
perhaps when we are in a new school or job or are taking on a new role in our personal lives
and are trying to gauge our own performances. When we feel more sure of who we are, we
focus less on how we appear to others.2

Figure 9.1 – A child looking at herself wearing glasses in a mirror.3

Mead
Herbert Mead (1967) offers an explanation of how we develop a social sense of self by being
able to see ourselves through the eyes of others. There are two parts of the self: the “I” which
is the part of the self that is spontaneous, creative, innate, and is not concerned with how
others view us and the “me” or the social definition of who we are.
When we are born, we are all “I” and act without concern about how others view us. But the
socialized self begins when we are able to consider how one important person views us. This
initial stage is called “taking the role of the significant other”. For example, a child may pull a
cat’s tail and be told by his mother, “No! Don’t do that, that’s bad” while receiving a slight slap
on the hand. Later, the child may mimic the same behavior toward the self and say aloud, “No,
that’s bad” while patting his own hand. What has happened? The child is able to see himself
through the eyes of the mother. As the child grows and is exposed to many situations and rules
of culture, he begins to view the self in the eyes of many others through these cultural norms or
rules. This is referred to as “taking the role of the generalized other” and results in a sense of
self with many dimensions. The child comes to have a sense of self as student, as friend, as son,
and so on.

Exaggerated Sense of Self
One of the ways to gain a clearer sense of self is to exaggerate those qualities that are to be
incorporated into the self. Preschoolers often like to exaggerate their own qualities or to seek
validation as the biggest, smartest, or child who can jump the highest. This exaggeration tends
to be replaced by a more realistic sense of self in middle childhood.

Self-Esteem
Early childhood is a time of forming an initial sense of self. Self-concept is our self-description
according to various categories, such as our external and internal qualities. In contrast, selfesteem is an evaluative judgment about who we are. The emergence of cognitive skills in this
age group results in improved perceptions of the self, but they tend to focus on external
qualities, which are referred to as the categorical self. When researchers ask young children to
describe themselves, their descriptions tend to include physical descriptors, preferred activities,
and favorite possessions. Thus, the self-description of a 3-year-old might be a 3-year-old girl
with red hair, who likes to play with blocks. However, even children as young as three know
there is more to themselves than these external characteristics.
Harter and Pike (1984) challenged the method of measuring personality with an open-ended
question as they felt that language limitations were hindering the ability of young children to
express their self-knowledge. They suggested a change to the method of measuring selfconcept in young children, whereby researchers provide statements that ask whether
something is true of the child (e.g., “I like to boss people around”, “I am grumpy most of the
time”). They discovered that in early childhood, children answer these statements in an
internally consistent manner, especially after the age of four (Goodvin, Meyer, Thompson &
Hayes, 2008) and often give similar responses to what others (parents and teachers) say about
the child (Brown, Mangelsdorf, Agathen, & Ho, 2008; Colwell & Lindsey, 2003).

Figure 9.2 – Young children don’t always feel good about themselves.4

Young children tend to have a generally positive self-image. This optimism is often the result of
a lack of social comparison when making self-evaluations (Ruble, Boggiano, Feldman, & Loeble,
1980), and with comparison between what the child once could do to what they can do now
(Kemple, 1995). However, this does not mean that preschool children are exempt from
negative self-evaluations. Preschool children with insecure attachments to their caregivers tend
to have lower self-esteem at age four (Goodvin et al., 2008). Maternal negative affect
(emotional state) was also found by Goodwin and her colleagues to produce more negative
self-evaluations in preschool children.

Self-Control
Self-control is not a single phenomenon, but is multi-facetted. It includes response initiation,
the ability to not initiate a behavior before you have evaluated all of the information, response
inhibition, the ability to stop a behavior that has already begun, and delayed gratification, the
ability to hold out for a larger reward by forgoing a smaller immediate reward (Dougherty,
Marsh, Mathias, & Swann, 2005). It is in early childhood that we see the start of self-control, a
process that takes many years to fully develop. In the now classic “Marshmallow Test” (Mischel,
Ebbesen, & Zeiss, 1972) children are confronted with the choice of a small immediate reward (a
marshmallow) and a larger delayed reward (more marshmallows). Walter Mischel and his
colleagues over the years have found that the ability to delay gratification at the age of four
predicted better academic performance and health later in life (Mischel, et al., 2011). Selfcontrol is related to executive function, discussed earlier in the chapter. As executive function
improves, children become less impulsive (Traverso, Viterbori, & Usai, 2015).5

Self-Control and Play
Thanks to the new Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning
(PEDaL), Whitebread, Baker, Gibson and a team of researchers hope to provide evidence on
the role played by play in how a child develops.
“A strong possibility is that play supports the early development of children’s self-control,”
explains Baker. “These are our abilities to develop awareness of our own thinking processes –
they influence how effectively we go about undertaking challenging activities.”
In a study carried out by Baker with toddlers and young preschoolers, she found that children
with greater self-control solved problems quicker when exploring an unfamiliar set-up
requiring scientific reasoning, regardless of their IQ. “This sort of evidence makes us think
that giving children the chance to play will make them more successful and creative problemsolvers in the long run.”
If playful experiences do facilitate this aspect of development, say the researchers, it could be
extremely significant for educational practices because the ability to self-regulate has been
shown to be a key predictor of academic performance.
Gibson adds: “Playful behavior is also an important indicator of healthy social and emotional
development. In my previous research, I investigated how observing children at play can give
us important clues about their well being and can even be useful in the diagnosis of
neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.”6

Erikson: Initiative vs. Guilt
Psychologist Erik Erikson argues that children in early childhood go through a stage of “initiative
vs. guilt”. If the child is placed in an environment where he/she can explore, make decisions,
and initiate activities, they have achieved initiative. On the other hand, if the child is put in an
environment where initiation is repressed through criticism and control, he/she will develop a
sense of guilt.

Figure 9.3 – Children playing in the sand.7

The trust and autonomy of previous stages develop into a desire to take initiative or to think of
ideas and initiative action. Children may want to build a fort with the cushions from the living
room couch or open a lemonade stand in the driveway or make a zoo with their stuffed animals
and issue tickets to those who want to come. Or they may just want to get themselves ready for
bed without any assistance. To reinforce taking initiative, caregivers should offer praise for the
child’s efforts and avoid being critical of messes or mistakes. Soggy washrags and toothpaste
left in the sink pales in comparison to the smiling face of a five-year-old that emerges from the
bathroom with clean teeth and pajamas!8

Gender Identity, Gender Constancy, and Gender Roles
Another important dimension of the self is the sense of self as male or female. Preschool-aged
children become increasingly interested in finding out the differences between boys and girls
both physically and in terms of what activities are acceptable for each. While 2 year olds can
identify some differences and learn whether they are boys or girls, preschoolers become more
interested in what it means to be male or female. This self-identification or gender identity is
followed sometime later with gender constancy or the knowledge that gender does not
change. Gender roles or the rights and expectations that are associated with being male or
female are learned throughout childhood and into adulthood.

Freud and the Phallic Stage
Freud believed that masculinity and femininity were learned during the phallic stage of
psychosexual development. According to Freud, during the phallic stage, the child develops an
attraction to the opposite-sex parent but after recognizing that that they cannot actually be
romantically involved with that parent, the child learns to model their own behavior after the
same-sex parent. The child develops his or her own sense of masculinity or femininity from this
resolution. And, according to Freud, a person who does not exhibit gender appropriate
behavior, such as a woman who competes with men for jobs or a man who lacks self-assurance
and dominance, has not successfully completed this stage of development. Consequently, such
a person continues to struggle with his or her own gender identity.

Chodorow and Mothering
Chodorow, a Neo-Freudian, believed that mothering promotes gender stereotypic
behavior. Mothers push their sons away too soon and direct their attention toward problemsolving and independence. As a result, sons grow up confident in their own abilities but
uncomfortable with intimacy. Girls are kept dependent too long and are given unnecessary and
even unwelcome assistance from their mothers. Girls learn to underestimate their abilities and
lack assertiveness, but feel comfortable with intimacy.

Figure 9.4 – A boy showing independence and
confidence.9

Figure 9.5 – A girl showing dependence and comfort
within a relationship.10

Both of these models assume that early childhood experiences result in lifelong gender selfconcepts. However, gender socialization is a process that continues throughout life. Children,
teens, and adults refine and can modify their sense of self based on gender.

Learning through Reinforcement and Modeling
Learning theorists suggest that gender role socialization is a result of the ways in which parents,
teachers, friends, schools, religious institutions, media and others send messages about what is
acceptable or desirable behavior as males or females. This socialization begins early-in fact, it
may even begin the moment a parent learns that a child is on the way. Knowing the sex of the
child can conjure up images of the child’s behavior, appearance, and potential on the part of a
parent. And this stereotyping continues to guide perception through life. Consider parents of
newborns, shown a 7 pound, 20 inch baby, wrapped in blue (a color designating males) describe
the child as tough, strong, and angry when crying. Shown the same infant in pink (a color used
in the United States for baby girls), these parents are likely to describe the baby as pretty,
delicate, and frustrated when crying. (Maccoby & Jacklin, 1987). Female infants are held more,
talked to more frequently and given direct eye contact, while male infants play is often
mediated through a toy or activity.
Sons are given tasks that take them outside the house and that have to be performed only on
occasion while girls are more likely to be given chores inside the home such as cleaning or
cooking that is performed daily. Sons are encouraged to think for themselves when they
encounter problems and daughters are more likely to be given assistance even when they are
working on an answer. This impatience is reflected in teachers waiting less time when asking a
female student for an answer than when asking for a reply from a male student (Sadker and
Sadker, 1994). Girls are given the message from teachers that they must try harder and endure
in order to succeed while boys’ successes are attributed to their intelligence. Of course, the
stereotypes of advisors can also influence which kinds of courses or vocational choices girls and
boys are encouraged to make.
Friends discuss what is acceptable for boys and girls and popularity may be based on modeling
what is considered ideal behavior or looks for the sexes. Girls tend to tell one another secrets to
validate others as best friends while boys compete for position by emphasizing their
knowledge, strength or accomplishments. This focus on accomplishments can even give rise to
exaggerating accomplishments in boys, but girls are discouraged from showing off and may
learn to minimize their accomplishments as a result.
Gender messages abound in our environment. But does this mean that each of us receives and
interprets these messages in the same way? Probably not. In addition to being recipients of
these cultural expectations, we are individuals who also modify these roles (Kimmel, 2008).
Based on what young children learn about gender from parents, peers, and those who they
observe in society, children develop their own conceptions of the attributes associated with
maleness or femaleness which is referred to as gender schemas.
How much does gender matter? In the United States, gender differences are found in school
experiences (even into college and professional school, girls are less vocal in the classrooms and
much more at risk for sexual harassment from teachers, coaches, classmates, and professors),
in social interactions and in media messages. The stereotypes that boys should be strong,
forceful, active, dominant, and rational and that girls should be pretty, subordinate,

unintelligent, emotional, and gabby are portrayed in children’s toys, books, commercials, video
games, movies, television shows and music.

colors and girls’ toys.11

Figure 9.7 – Store shelves filled with primary colors
and boys’ toys.12

In adulthood, these differences are reflected in income gaps between men and women where
women working full-time earn about 74 percent the income of men, in higher rates of women
suffering rape and domestic violence, higher rates of eating disorders for females, and in higher
rates of violent death for men in young adulthood. Each of these differences will be explored
further in subsequent chapters.13

Gender Dysphoria
A growing body of research is now focused on Gender Dysphoria, or the distress accompanying
a mismatch between one’s gender identity and biological sex (American Psychiatric Association,
2013). Although prevalence rates are low, at approximately 0.3 percent of the United States
population (Russo, 2016), children who later identified as transgender, often stated that they
were the opposite gender as soon as they began talking. Comments such as stating they prefer
the toys, clothing and anatomy of the opposite sex, while rejecting the toys, clothing, and
anatomy of their assigned sex are criteria for a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria in children.
Certainly, many young children do not conform to the gender roles modeled by the culture and
even push back against assigned roles. However, they do not experience discomfort regarding
their gender identity and would not be identified with Gender Dysphoria. A more
comprehensive description of Gender Dysphoria, including current treatments, will be
discussed in the chapter on adolescence.14

Family Life
Relationships between parents and children continue to play a significant role in children’s
development during early childhood. We will explore two models of parenting styles. Keep in
mind that most parents do not follow any model completely. Real people tend to fall
somewhere in between these styles. And sometimes parenting styles change from one child to
the next or in times when the parent has more or less time and energy for parenting. Parenting
styles can also be affected by concerns the parent has in other areas of his or her life. For
example, parenting styles tend to become more authoritarian when parents are tired and
perhaps more authoritative when they are more energetic. Sometimes parents seem to change
their parenting approach when others are around, maybe because they become more selfconscious as parents or are concerned with giving others the impression that they are a “tough”
parent or an “easy-going” parent. And of course, parenting styles may reflect the type of
parenting someone saw modeled while growing up.

Figure 9.8 – A family playing outside together.15

Baumrind
Baumrind (1971) offers a model of parenting that includes four styles. The first, authoritarian,
is the traditional model of parenting in which parents make the rules and children are expected
to be obedient. Baumrind suggests that authoritarian parents tend to place maturity demands
on their children that are unreasonably high and tend to be aloof and distant. Consequently,
children reared in this way may fear rather than respect their parents and, because their
parents do not allow discussion, may take out their frustrations on safer targets-perhaps as
bullies toward peers.
Permissive parenting involves holding expectations of children that are below what could be
reasonably expected from them. Children are allowed to make their own rules and determine
their own activities. Parents are warm and communicative, but provide little structure for their
children. Children fail to learn self-discipline and may feel somewhat insecure because they do
not know the limits.

Authoritative parenting involves being appropriately strict, reasonable, and
affectionate. Parents allow negotiation where appropriate and discipline matches the severity
of the offense. A popular parenting program that is offered in many school districts is called
“Love and Logic” and reflects the authoritative or democratic style of parenting just described.
Uninvolved parents (also referred to as rejecting/neglecting) are disengaged from their
children. They do not make demands on their children and are non-responsive. These children
can suffer in school and in their relationships with their peers (Gecas & Self, 1991).

Lemasters and Defrain
Lemasters and Defrain (1989) offer another model of parenting. This model is interesting
because it looks more closely at the motivations of the parent and suggests that parenting
styles are often designed to meet the psychological needs of the parent rather than the
developmental needs of the child.
The martyr is a parent who will do anything for the child; even tasks that the child should do for
himself or herself. All of the good deeds performed for the child, in the name of being a “good
parent”, may be used later should the parent want to gain compliance from the child. If a child
goes against the parent’s wishes, the parent can remind the child of all of the times the parent
helped the child and evoke a feeling of guilt so that the child will do what the parent
wants. The child learns to be dependent and manipulative as a result.
The pal is like the permissive parent described previously in Baumrind’s model. The pal wants
to be the child’s friend. Perhaps the parent is lonely or perhaps the parent is trying to win a
popularity contest against an ex-spouse. Pals let children do what they want and focus mostly
on being entertaining and fun and set few limitations. Consequently, the child may have little
self-discipline and may try to test limits with others.
The police officer/drill sergeant style of parenting is similar to the authoritarian parent
described by Baumrind. The parent focuses primarily on making sure that the child is obedient
and that the parent has full control of the child. Sometimes this can be taken to extreme by
giving the child tasks that are really designed to check on their level of obedience. For example,
the parent may require that the child fold the clothes and place items back in the drawer in a
particular way. If not, the child might be scolded or punished for not doing things “right”. This
type of parent has a very difficult time allowing the child to grow and learn to make decisions
independently. And the child may have a lot of resentment toward the parent that is displaced
on others.
The teacher-counselor parent is one who pays a lot of attention to expert advice on parenting
and who believes that as long as all of the steps are followed, the parent can rear a perfect
child. “What’s wrong with that?” you might ask. There are two major problems with this
approach. First, the parent is taking all of the responsibility for the child’s behavior-at least

220 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

indirectly. If the child has difficulty, the parent feels responsible and thinks that the solution lies
in reading more advice and trying more diligently to follow that advice.
Parents can certainly influence children, but thinking that the parent is fully responsible for the
child’s outcome is misguided. A parent can only do so much and can never have full control
over the child. Another problem with this approach is that the child may get an unrealistic
sense of the world and what can be expected from others. For example, if a teacher-counselor
parent decides to help the child build self-esteem and has read that telling the child how special
he or she is or how important it is to compliment the child on a job well done, the parent may
convey the message that everything the child does is exceptional or extraordinary. A child may
come to expect that all of his efforts warrant praise and in the real world, this is not something
one can expect. Perhaps children get more of a sense of pride from assessing their own
performance than from having others praise their efforts.

Figure 9.9 – A father interacting with his son who is drawing a picture. He could be portraying the style of teachercounselor or athletic coach16

So what is left? Lemasters and Defrain (1989) suggest that the athletic coach style of
parenting is best. Before you draw conclusions here, set aside any negative experiences you
may have had with coaches in the past. The principles of coaching are what are important to
Lemasters and Defrain. A coach helps players form strategies, supports their efforts, gives
feedback on what went right and what went wrong, and stands at the sideline while the players
perform. Coaches and referees make sure that the rules of the game are followed and that all
players adhere to those rules. Similarly, the athletic coach as parent helps the child understand
what needs to happen in certain situations whether in friendships, school, or home life, and
encourages and advises the child about how to manage these situations. The parent does not
intervene or do things for the child. Their role is to provide guidance while the child learns
firsthand how to handle these situations. And the rules for behavior are consistent and
objective and presented in that way. So, a child who is late for dinner might hear the parent
respond in this way, “Dinner was at six o’clock.” Rather than, “You know good and well that we
16

221 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

always eat at six. If you expect me to get up and make something for you now, you have got
another thing coming! Just who do you think you are showing up late and looking for
food? You’re grounded until further notice!”
The most important thing to remember about parenting is that you can be a better, more
objective parent when you are directing your actions toward the child’s needs and while
considering what they can reasonably be expected to do at their stage of development.
Parenting is more difficult when you are tired and have psychological needs that interfere with
the relationship. Some of the best advice for parents is to try not to take the child’s actions
personally and be as objective as possible.

Cultural Influences on Parenting Styles
The impact of class and culture cannot be ignored when examining parenting styles. The two
models of parenting described above assume that authoritative and athletic coaching styles are
best because they are designed to help the parent raise a child who is independent, self-reliant
and responsible. These are qualities favored in “individualistic” cultures such as the United
States, particularly by the white middle class. African-American, Hispanic and Asian parents
tend to be more authoritarian than non-Hispanic whites.

Figure 9.10 – A family from a collectivistic culture.17

In “collectivistic” cultures such as China or Korea, being obedient and compliant are favored
behaviors. Authoritarian parenting has been used historically and reflects cultural need for
children to do as they are told. In societies where family members’ cooperation is necessary for
survival, as in the case of raising crops, rearing children who are independent and who strive to
be on their own makes no sense. But in an economy based on being mobile in order to find jobs

17

222 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

and where one’s earnings are based on education, raising a child to be independent is very
important.
Working class parents are more likely than middle class parents to focus on obedience and
honesty when raising their children. In a classic study on social class and parenting styles
called Class and Conformity, Kohn (1977) explains that parents tend to emphasize qualities that
are needed for their own survival when parenting their children. Working class parents are
rewarded for being obedient, reliable, and honest in their jobs. They are not paid to be
independent or to question the management; rather, they move up and are considered good
employees if they show up on time, do their work as they are told, and can be counted on by
their employers. Consequently, these parents reward honesty and obedience in their children.
Middle class parents who work as professionals are rewarded for taking initiative, being selfdirected, and assertive in their jobs. They are required to get the job done without being told
exactly what to do. They are asked to be innovative and to work independently. These parents
encourage their children to have those qualities as well by rewarding independence and selfreliance. Parenting styles can reflect many elements of culture.18

Spanking
Many adults can remember being spanked as a child. This method of discipline continues to
be endorsed by the majority of parents (Smith, 2012). Just how effective is spanking,
however, and are there any negative consequences? After reviewing the research, Smith
(2012) states “many studies have shown that physical punishment, including spanking, hitting
and other means of causing pain, can lead to increased aggression, antisocial behavior,
physical injury and mental health problems for children” (p. 60).

Spanking
Gershoff, (2008) reviewed decades of research and recommended that parents and
caregivers make every effort to avoid physical punishment and called for the banning of
physical discipline in all U.S. schools. Gershoff and Grogan-Kaylor (2016) completed another
metanalysis that looked at research over 160,927 children . They found increased risk for
negative outcomes for children who are spanked and that effects of spanking were similar to
that of physical abuse.
In a longitudinal study that followed more than 1500 families from 20 U.S. cities, parents’
reports of spanking were assessed at ages three and five (MacKenzie, Nicklas, Waldfogel, &
Brooks-Gunn, 2013). Measures of externalizing behavior (aggression and rule-breaking) and
receptive vocabulary were assessed at age nine.
Overall, 57% of mothers and 40% of fathers engaged in spanking when children were age 3,
and 52% of mothers and 33% of fathers engaged in spanking at age 5. Maternal spanking at
age 5, even at low levels, was associated with higher levels of aggression at age 9, even after
an array of risks and earlier child behavior were controlled for. Father's high-frequency
spanking at age 5 was associated with lower child receptive vocabulary scores at age 9. This
study revealed the negative cognitive effects of spanking in addition to the increase in
aggressive behavior.
Internationally, physical discipline is increasingly being viewed as a violation of children’s
human rights. Thirty countries have banned the use of physical punishment, and the United
Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (2014) called physical punishment “legalized
violence against children” and advocated that physical punishment be eliminated in all
settings.
Alternatives to spanking are advocated by child development specialists and include:
 Praising and modeling appropriate behavior
 Providing time-outs for inappropriate behavior
 Giving choices
 Helping the child identify emotions and learning to calm down
 Ignoring small annoyances
 Withdrawing privileges

Changing Families in a Changing Society
The sociology of the family examines the family as an institution and a unit of socialization.
Sociological studies of the family look at demographic characteristics of the family members:
family size, age, ethnicity and gender of its members, social class of the family, the economic
level and mobility of the family, professions of its members, and the education levels of the
family members.

224 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Currently, one of the biggest issues that sociologists study are the changing roles of family
members. Often, each member is restricted by the gender roles of the traditional family. These
roles, such as the father as the breadwinner and the mother as the homemaker, are declining.
Now, the mother is often the supplementary provider while retaining the responsibilities of
child rearing. In this scenario, females' role in the labor force is "compatible with the demands
of the traditional family." Sociology studies the adaptation of males' role to caregiver as well as
provider. The gender roles are increasingly interwoven.

Diverse Family Forms
A single parent family usually refers to a parent who has most of the day-to-day responsibilities
in the raising of the child or children, who is not living with a spouse or partner, or who is not
married. The dominant caregiver is the parent with whom the children reside the majority of
the time. If the parents are separated or divorced, children live with their custodial parent and
have visitation with their noncustodial parent. In western society in general, following
separation a child will end up with the primary caregiver, usually the mother, and a secondary
caregiver, usually the father. There is a growing community of single parent by choice families
in which a family is built by a single adult (through foster care, adoption, donor gametes and
embryos, and surrogacy).

Figure 9.12 – A single-parent family.20

Cohabitation is an arrangement where two people who are not married live together in an
intimate relationship, particularly an emotionally and/or sexually intimate one, on a long-term
or permanent basis. Today, cohabitation is a common pattern among people in the Western
world. More than two-thirds of married couples in the U.S. say that they lived together before
getting married.

Gay and lesbian couples are categorized as same-sex relationships. 21 After a Supreme Court
ruling in 2015, all 50 states in the U.S. must recognize same-sex marriage, there are still some
counties in several states that will not issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple.22

Figure 9.13 – A family with parents of the same sex.23

Sibling Relationships
Siblings spend a considerable amount of time with each other and offer a unique relationship
that is not found with same-age peers or with adults. Siblings play an important role in the
development of social skills. Cooperative and pretend play interactions between younger and
older siblings can teach empathy, sharing, and cooperation (Pike, Coldwell, & Dunn, 2005) as
well as negotiation and conflict resolution (Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). However, the quality of
sibling relationships is often mediated by the quality of the parent-child relationship and the
psychological adjustment of the child (Pike et al., 2005). For instance, more negative
interactions between siblings have been reported in families where parents had poor patterns
of communication with their children (Brody, Stoneman, & McCoy, 1994). Children who have
emotional and behavioral problems are also more likely to have negative interactions with their
siblings. However, the psychological adjustment of the child can sometimes be a reflection of
the parent-child relationship. Thus, when examining the quality of sibling interactions, it is
often difficult to tease out the separate effect of adjustment from the effect of the parent-child
relationship.
While parents want positive interactions between their children, conflicts are going to arise,
and some confrontations can be the impetus for growth in children’s social and cognitive skills.
The sources of conflict between siblings often depend on their respective ages. Dunn and Munn
(1987) revealed that over half of all sibling conflicts in early childhood were disputes about
property rights. By middle childhood this starts shifting toward control over social situations,
such as what games to play, disagreements about facts or opinions, or rude behavior (Howe,

Rinaldi, Jennings, & Petrakos, 2002). Researchers have also found that the strategies children
use to deal with conflict change with age, but that this is also tempered by the nature of the
conflict.
Abuhatoum and Howe (2013) found that coercive strategies (e.g., threats) were preferred when
the dispute centered on property rights, while reasoning was more likely to be used by older
siblings and in disputes regarding control over the social situation. However, younger siblings
also use reasoning, frequently bringing up the concern of legitimacy (e.g., “You’re not the
boss”) when in conflict with an older sibling. This is a very common strategy used by younger
siblings and is possibly an adaptive strategy in order for younger siblings to assert their
autonomy (Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). A number of researchers have found that children who
can use non-coercive strategies are more likely to have a successful resolution, whereby a
compromise is reached and neither child feels slighted (Ram & Ross, 2008; Abuhatoum &
Howe, 2013).
Not surprisingly, friendly relationships with siblings often lead to more positive interactions
with peers. The reverse is also true. A child can also learn to get along with a sibling, with, as
the song says “a little help from my friends” (Kramer & Gottman, 1992).24

Figure 9.14 – Siblings.25

Child Care Concerns
About 77.3 percent of mothers of school-aged and 64.2 percent of mothers of preschool-aged
children in the United States work outside the home (Cohen and Bianchi, 1999; Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2010). Seventy-five percent of children under age 5 are in scheduled childcare
programs. Others are cared for by family members or friends. Older children are often in after
school programs, before school programs, or stay at home alone after school once they are
older.

Quality childcare programs can enhance a child’s social skills and can provide rich learning
experiences. But long hours in poor quality care can have negative consequences, especially for
young children.

Quality of Care
What determines the quality of child care? One consideration is the teacher/child ratio. States
specify the maximum number of children that can be supervised by one teacher. In general, the
younger the children, the more teachers required for a given number of children. The lower the
teacher to child ratio, the more time the teacher has for involvement with the children and the
less stressed the teacher may be so that the interactions can be more relaxed, stimulating and
positive. Larger group sizes present challenges to quality as well. The program may be more
rigid in rules and structure to accommodate the large number of children in the facility.
The physical environment should be engaging, clean, and safe. The philosophy of the
organization and the curriculum available should be child-centered, positive, and
stimulating. Providers should be trained in early childhood education. A majority of states do
not require training for their childcare providers. And while formal education is not required for
a person to provide a warm, loving relationship to a child, knowledge of a child’s development
is useful for addressing their social, emotional, and cognitive needs in an effective way.

Figure 9.15 – Children playing in a quality childcare environment.26

By working toward improving the quality of childcare and increasing family-friendly workplace
policies such as more flexible scheduling and perhaps childcare facilities at places of
employment, we can accommodate families with smaller children and relieve parents of the
stress sometimes associated with managing work and family life.27

Peers
Relationships within the family (parent-child and siblings) are not the only significant
relationships in a child’s life. Peer relationships are also important. Social interaction with
another child who is similar in age, skills, and knowledge provokes the development of many
social skills that are valuable for the rest of life (Bukowski, Buhrmester, & Underwood, 2011). In
peer relationships, children learn how to initiate and maintain social interactions with other
children. They learn skills for managing conflict, such as turn-taking, compromise, and
bargaining. Play also involves the mutual, sometimes complex, coordination of goals, actions,
and understanding. For example, as preschoolers engage in pretend play they create narratives
together, choose roles, and collaborate to act out their stories. Through these experiences,
children develop friendships that provide additional sources of security and support to those
provided by their parents.

Figure 9.16 – Navigating dramatic play provides great opportunities to
continue to develop social skills with same-age peers .28

However, peer relationships can be challenging as well as supportive (Rubin, Coplan, Chen,
Bowker, & McDonald, 2011). Being accepted by other children is an important source of
affirmation and self-esteem, but peer rejection can foreshadow later behavior problems
(especially when children are rejected due to aggressive behavior).
Peer relationships require developing very different social and emotional skills than those that
emerge in parent-child relationships. They also illustrate the many ways that peer relationships
influence the growth of personality and self-concept.29

Play
Freud saw play as a means for children to release pent-up emotions and to deal with
emotionally distressing situations in a more secure environment. Vygotsky and Piaget saw play

as a way of children developing their intellectual abilities (Dyer & Moneta, 2006). Piaget created
stages of play that correspond with his stages of cognitive development. The stages are:

While Freud, Piaget, and Vygostsky looked at play slightly differently, all three theorists saw
play as providing positive outcomes for children.
Mildred Parten (1932) observed two to five year-old children and noted six types of play. Three
types she labeled as non-social (unoccupied, solitary, and onlooker) and three types were
categorized as social play (parallel, associative, and cooperative). The table below describes
each type of play. Younger children engage in non-social play more than those who are older;
by age five associative and cooperative play are the most common forms of play (Dyer &
Moneta, 2006). 34

Table 9.3 - Parten’s Classification of Types of Play35
Category

Description

Unoccupied Play Children’s behavior seems more random and without a specific goal. This is
the least common form of play.
Solitary Play

Children play by themselves, do not interact with others, nor are they
engaging in similar activities as the children around them.

Onlooker Play

Children are observing other children playing. They may comment on the
activities and even make suggestions, but will not directly join the play.

Parallel Play

Children play alongside each other, using similar toys, but do not directly
act with each other

Associative Play

Children will interact with each other and share toys, but are not working
toward a common goal.

Cooperative
Play

Children are interacting to achieve a common goal. Children may take on
different tasks to reach that goal.

Social Understanding
As we have seen, children’s experience of relationships at home and the peer group contributes
to an expanding repertoire of social and emotional skills and also to broadened social
understanding. In these relationships, children develop expectations for specific people
(leading, for example, to secure or insecure attachments to parents), understanding of how to
interact with adults and peers, and developing self-concept based on how others respond to
them. These relationships are also significant forums for emotional development.
Remarkably, young children begin developing social understanding very early in life. Before the
end of the first year, infants are aware that other people have perceptions, feelings, and other
mental states that affect their behavior, and which are different from the child’s own mental
states. Carefully designed experimental studies show that by late in the preschool years, young
children understand that another’s beliefs can be mistaken rather than correct, that memories
can affect how you feel, and that one’s emotions can be hidden from others (Wellman, 2011).
Social understanding grows significantly as children’s theory of mind develops.

How do these achievements in social understanding occur? One answer is that young children
are remarkably sensitive observers of other people, making connections between their
emotional expressions, words, and behavior to derive simple inferences about mental states
(e.g., concluding, for example, that what Mommy is looking at is in her mind) (Gopnik, Meltzoff,
& Kuhl, 2001). This is especially likely to occur in relationships with people whom the child
knows well, consistent with the ideas of attachment theory discussed above.

Figure 9.17 – A father speaking to his child.36

Growing language skills give young children words with which to represent these mental states
(e.g., “mad,” “wants”) and talk about them with others. Thus in conversation with their parents
about everyday experiences, children learn much about people’s mental states from how adults
talk about them (“Your sister was sad because she thought Daddy was coming home.”)
(Thompson, 2006b).
Developing social understanding is based on children’s everyday interactions with others and
their careful interpretations of what they see and hear. There are also some scientists who
believe that infants are biologically prepared to perceive people in a special way, as organisms
with an internal mental life, and this facilitates their interpretation of people’s behavior with
reference to those mental states (Leslie, 1994).

Personality
Parents often scrutinize their child’s preferences, characteristics, and responses for clues of a
developing personality. They are quite right to do so, because temperament is a foundation for
personality growth. But temperament (defined as early-emerging differences in reactivity and
self-regulation) is not the whole story. Although temperament is biologically based, it interacts
with the influence of experience from the moment of birth (if not before) to shape personality
(Rothbart, 2011). Temperamental dispositions are affected, for example, by the support level of
parental care. More generally, personality is shaped by the goodness of fit between the child’s
temperamental qualities and characteristics of the environment (Chess & Thomas, 1999). For
example, an adventurous child whose parents regularly take her on weekend hiking and fishing
trips would be a good “fit” to her lifestyle, supporting personality growth. Personality is the
36

232 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

result, therefore, of the continuous interplay between biological disposition and experience, as
is true for many other aspects of social and personality development.
Personality develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson, Winer, & Goodvin, 2010).
As children mature biologically, temperamental characteristics emerge and change over time. A
newborn is not capable of much self-control, but as brain-based capacities for self-control
advance, temperamental changes in self-regulation become more apparent. So an infant that
cries frequently doesn’t necessarily have a grumpy personality. With sufficient parental support
and increased sense of security, the child may develop into a content preschooler that is not
likely to cry to get her needs met.

Figure 9.18 – A girl enjoying nature.37

In addition, personality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children’s
developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals,
their coping styles, their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, and many other
qualities are encompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by biological
dispositions, but even more by the child’s experiences with others, particularly in close
relationships, that guide the growth of individual characteristics.
Indeed, personality development begins with the biological foundations of temperament but
becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The newborn that parents
observed in wonder upon becomes an adult with a personality of depth and nuance.

Social and Emotional Competence
Social and personality development is built from the social, biological, and representational
influences discussed above. These influences result in important developmental outcomes that
37

matter to children, parents, and society: a young adult’s capacity to engage in socially
constructive actions (helping, caring, sharing with others), to curb hostile or aggressive
impulses, to live according to meaningful moral values, to develop a healthy identity and sense
of self, and to develop talents and achieve success in using them. These are some of the
developmental outcomes that denote social and emotional competence.
These achievements of social and personality development derive from the interaction of many
social, biological, and representational influences. Consider, for example, the development of
conscience, which is an early foundation for moral development.
Conscience consists of the cognitive, emotional, and social influences that cause young children
to create and act consistently with internal standards of conduct (Kochanska, 2002). It emerges
from young children’s experiences with parents, particularly in the development of a mutually
responsive relationship that motivates young children to respond constructively to the parents’
requests and expectations. Biologically based temperament is involved, as some children are
temperamentally more capable of motivated self-regulation (a quality called effortful control)
than are others, while some children are more prone to the fear and anxiety that parental
disapproval can evoke. The development of conscience is influenced by having good fit
between the child’s temperamental qualities and how parents communicate and reinforce
behavioral expectations.
Conscience development also expands as young children begin to represent moral values and
think of themselves as moral beings. By the end of the preschool years, for example, young
children develop a “moral self” by which they think of themselves as people who want to do
the right thing, who feel badly after misbehaving, and who feel uncomfortable when others
misbehave. In the development of conscience, young children become more socially and
emotionally competent in a manner that provides a foundation for later moral conduct
(Thompson, 2012).

Childhood Stress and Development
What is the impact of stress on child development? Children experience different types of
stressors. Normal, everyday stress can provide an opportunity for young children to build
coping skills and poses little risk to development. Even more long-lasting stressful events such
as changing schools or losing a loved one can be managed fairly well. But children who
experience toxic stress or who live in extremely stressful situations of abuse over long periods
of time can suffer long-lasting effects. The structures in the midbrain or limbic system such as
the hippocampus and amygdala can be vulnerable to prolonged stress during early childhood
(Middlebrooks and Audage, 2008). High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can reduce the
size of the hippocampus and effect the child's memory abilities. Stress hormones can also
reduce immunity to disease. The brain exposed to long periods of severe stress can develop a
low threshold making the child hypersensitive to stress in the future. However, the effects of
stress can be minimized if the child has the support of caring adults. Let's take a look at
childhood stressors.

Effects of Domestic Abuse
3.3 million children witness domestic violence each year in the US. There has been an increase
in acknowledgment that children exposed to domestic abuse during their upbringing will suffer
in their developmental and psychological welfare. Because of the awareness of domestic
violence that some children have to face, it also generally impacts how the child develops
emotionally, socially, behaviorally as well as cognitively. Some emotional and behavioral
problems that can result due to domestic violence include increased aggressiveness, anxiety,
and changes in how a child socializes with friends, family, and authorities. Bruises, broken
bones, head injuries, lacerations, and internal bleeding are some of the acute effects of a
domestic violence incident that require medical attention and hospitalization.

Child Maltreatment
Child abuse is the physical, sexual, or emotional mistreatment or neglect of a child or children.
Different jurisdictions have developed their own definitions of what constitutes child abuse for
the purposes of removing a child from his/her family and/or prosecuting a criminal charge.
There are four major categories of child abuse: neglect, physical abuse,
psychological/emotional abuse, and sexual abuse. Neglect is the most common type of abuse in
the United States and accounts for over 60 percent of child abuse cases.

235 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Figure 9.20 – A child hiding.39

Physical Abuse
Physical abuse involves physical aggression directed at a child by an adult. Most nations with
child-abuse laws consider the deliberate infliction of serious injuries, or actions that place the
child at obvious risk of serious injury or death, to be illegal. Beyond this, there is considerable
variation. The distinction between child discipline and abuse is often poorly defined. Cultural
norms about what constitutes abuse vary widely among professionals as well as the wider
public. Some professionals claim that cultural norms that sanction physical punishment are one
of the causes of child abuse, and have undertaken campaigns to redefine such norms.

Sexual Abuse
Child sexual abuse is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child
for sexual stimulation. Effects of child sexual abuse include guilt and self-blame, flashbacks,
nightmares, insomnia, and fear of things associated with the abuse. Approximately 15 percent
to 25 percent of women and 5 percent to 15 percent of men were sexually abused when they
were children.

Emotional Abuse
Out of all the possible forms of abuse, emotional abuse is the hardest to define. It could include
name-calling, ridicule, degradation, destruction of personal belongings, torture or killing of a
pet, excessive criticism, inappropriate or excessive demands, withholding communication, and
routine labeling or humiliation.

Neglect
Neglect is a passive form of abuse in which a perpetrator is responsible to provide care for a
victim who is unable to care for himself or herself, but fails to provide adequate care. Neglect
may include the failure to provide sufficient supervision, nourishment, or medical care, or the
failure to fulfill other needs for which the victim is helpless to provide for himself or herself. The
term is also applied when necessary care is withheld by those responsible for providing it from
animals, plants, and even inanimate objects. Neglect can have many long-term side effects,
39

236 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

such as physical injuries, low self-esteem, attention disorders, violent behavior, and even death.
In the U.S., neglect is defined as the failure to meet the basic needs of children: housing,
clothing, food, and access to medical care. Researchers found over 91,000 cases of neglect in
one year using information from a database of cases verified by protective services agencies.40

Development
Chapter Objectives

1. Describe the patterns of physical growth
2. Summarize nutrition needs
3. Explain the causes of obesity and the negative consequences of excessive weight gain
4. Discuss the pros and cons of organized sports
5. Compare and contrast developmental disorders
6. Summarize several different mental health disorders

Introduction
Children in middle childhood go through tremendous changes in the growth and development
of their brain. During this period of development children’s bodies are not only growing, but
they are becoming more coordinated and physically capable. These children are more mindful
of their greater abilities in school and are becoming more responsible for their health and diet.
Some children may be challenged with physical or mental health concerns. It’s important to
know what typical development looks like in order to identify and to help those that are
struggling with health concerns.

Brain Development
The brain reaches its adult size at about age 7. Then between 10 and 12 years of age, the
frontal lobes become more developed and improvements in logic, planning, and memory are
evident (van der Molen & Molenaar, 1994). The school-aged child is better able to plan and
coordinate activity using both the left and right hemispheres of the brain, which control the
development of emotions, physical abilities, and intellectual capabilities. The attention span
also improves as the prefrontal cortex matures. The myelin also continues to develop and the
child's reaction time improves as well. Myelination improvement is one factor responsible for
these growths.
From age 6 to 12, the nerve cells in the association areas of the brain, that is those areas where
sensory, motor, and intellectual functioning connect, become almost completely myelinated
(Johnson, 2005). This myelination contributes to increases in information processing speed and
the child’s reaction time. The hippocampus, which is responsible for transferring information
from the short-term to long-term memory, also shows increases in myelination resulting in
improvements in memory functioning (Rolls, 2000).

238 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Figure 10.1 – The human brain.1

Changes in the brain during this age enable not only physical development, but also allow
children to understand what others think of them and dealing socially with the positive and
negative consequences of that. Within this development period, children may struggle with
mental health disorders or other health problems. As children are growing and becoming more
capable, adults need to remember that children don’t grow physically in isolation. The
development of their bodies isn't separate from the changes that are occurring socially,
emotionally, and cognitively. Awareness and understanding of their other developmental
domains and needs will support the child during these changes.2

Physical Growth
Middle childhood spans the years between early childhood and adolescence, children are
approximately 6 to 11 years old. These children come in all shapes and sizes: height, weight,
abilities, and disabilities. Physical growth rates are generally slow and steady during these
years. However, growth spurts do occur during middle to late childhood (Spreen, Riser, &
Edgell, 1995). Typically, a child will gain about 5-7 pounds a year and grow about 2 inches per
year. They also tend to slim down and gain muscle strength. As bones lengthen and broaden
and muscles strengthen, many children want to engage in strenuous physical activity and can
participate for longer periods of time. In addition, the rate of growth for the extremities is
faster than for the trunk, which results in more adult-like proportions. Long-bone growth
stretches muscles and ligaments, which results in many children experiencing growing pains, at
night, in particular.3
Children between ages 6 and 9, show significant improvement in their abilities to perform
motor skills. This development growth allows children to gain greater control over the
movement of their bodies, mastering many gross and fine motor skills that were beyond that of

the younger child. Riding a bike that is bigger or running longer and further is a big
improvement in gross motor skills. Eye-hand coordination and fine motor skills allow for
children to become better at writing and cutting. Sports and extracurricular activities may
become a part of the lives of children during middle childhood due to their physical growth and
capabilities.

Nutritional Needs
A number of factors can influence children’s eating habits and attitudes toward food. Family
environment, societal trends, taste preferences, and messages in the media all impact the
emotions that children develop in relation to their diet. Television commercials can entice
children to consume sugary products, fatty fast foods, excess calories, refined ingredients, and
sodium. Therefore, it is critical that parents and caregivers direct children toward healthy
choices. 5
Parents greatly impact their child’s nutritional choices. This time in a child’s life provides an
opportunity for parents and other caregivers to reinforce good eating habits and to introduce

new foods into the diet, while remaining mindful of a child’s preferences. Parents should also
serve as role models for their children, who will often mimic their behavior and eating habits.
Parents must continue to help their school-aged child establish healthy eating habits and
attitudes toward food. Their primary role is to bring a wide variety of health-promoting foods
into the home, so that their children can make good choices.6
Let’s think for a moment about what our parents and grandparents used to eat? What are
some of the differences that you may have experienced as a child?
One hundred years ago, as families sat down to dinner, they might have eaten boiled potatoes
or corn, leafy vegetables such as cabbage or collards, fresh-baked bread, and, if they were
fortunate, a small amount of beef or chicken. Young and old alike benefitted from a sound diet
that packed a real nutritional punch. Times have changed. Many families today fill their dinner
plates with fatty foods, such as French Fries cooked in vegetable oil, a hamburger that contains
several ounces of ground beef, and a white-bread bun, with a single piece of lettuce and a slice
or two of tomato as the only vegetables served with the meal.

Figure 10.3 – A modern meal.7

Our diet has changed drastically as processed foods, which did not exist a century ago, and
animal-based foods now account for a large percentage of our calories. Not only has what we
eat changed, but the amount of it that we consume has greatly increased as well, as plates and
portion sizes have grown much larger. All of these choices impact our health, with short- and
long-term consequences as we age. Possible effects in the short-term include excess weight
gain and constipation. The possible long-term effects, primarily related to obesity, include the
risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, as well as other health and emotional
problems for children. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Overweight and Obesity:
Health Consequences.”8

During middle childhood, a healthy diet facilitates physical and mental development and helps
to maintain health and wellness. School-aged children experience steady, consistent growth,
but at a slower rate than they did in early childhood. This slowed growth rate can have lasting a
lasting impact if nutritional, caloric, and activity levels aren't adjusted in middle childhood
which can lead to excessive weight gain early in life and can lead to obesity into adolescence
and adulthood.9
Making sure that children have proper nutrients will allow for optimal growth and
development. Look at the figure below to familiarize yourself with food and the place setting
for healthy meals.

Figure 10.4 – Nutrition guidelines from the USDA.10

One way to encourage children to eat healthy foods is to make meal and snack time fun and
interesting. Parents should include children in food planning and preparation, for example
selecting items while grocery shopping or helping to prepare part of a meal, such as making a
salad. At this time, parents can also educate children about kitchen safety. It might be helpful to
cut sandwiches, meats, or pancakes into small or interesting shapes. In addition, parents should
offer nutritious desserts, such as fresh fruits, instead of calorie-laden cookies, cakes, salty
snacks, and ice cream. Studies show that children who eat family meals on a frequent basis
consume more nutritious foods.11

Energy
Children’s energy needs vary, depending on their growth and level of physical activity. Energy
requirements also vary according to gender. Girls require 1,200 to 1,400 calories a day from age
2 to 8 and 1,400-1,800 for age 9 to 13. Boys also need 1,200 to 1.400 calories daily from age 4

to 8 but their daily caloric needs go up to 1,600-2,000 from age 9 to 13. This range represents
individual differences, including how active the child is.12
Recommended intakes of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) and most
micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) are higher relative to body size, compared with nutrient
needs during adulthood. Therefore, children should be provided nutrient-dense food at mealand snack-time. However, it is important not to overfeed children, as this can lead to childhood
obesity, which is discussed in the next section.

Children and Vegetarianism
Another issue that some parents face with school-aged children is the decision to encourage a
child to become a vegetarian or a vegan. Some parents and caregivers decide to raise their
children as vegetarians for health, cultural, or other reasons. Preteens and teens may make the
choice to pursue vegetarianism on their own, due to concerns about animals or the
environment. No matter the reason, parents with vegetarian children must take care to ensure
vegetarian children get healthy, nutritious foods that provide all the necessary nutrients.

Types of Vegetarian Diets
There are several types of vegetarians, each with certain restrictions in terms of diet:
 Ovo-vegetarians. Ovo-vegetarians eat eggs, but do not eat any other animal products.
 Lacto-ovo-vegetarians. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians eat eggs and dairy products, but do not
eat any meat.
 Lacto-vegetarians. Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy products, but do not eat any other
animal products.
 Vegans. Vegans eat food only from plant sources, no animal products at all.

Figure 10.5 – An example of a school lunch.13

Children who consume some animal products, such as eggs, cheese, or other forms of dairy, can
meet their nutritional needs. For a child following a strict vegan diet, planning is needed to
ensure adequate intake of protein, iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and vitamin D. Legumes and nuts

can be eaten in place of meat, soy or almond milk fortified with calcium and vitamins D and
B12 can replace cow’s milk. Parents must be informed and knowledgeable in order to support
proper development for children with a vegetarian or vegan diet.14

Children and Malnutrition
Many may not know that malnutrition is a problem that many children face, in both developing
nations and the developed world. Even with the wealth of food in North America, many
children grow up malnourished, or even hungry. The US Census Bureau characterizes
households into the following groups:
 food secure
 food insecure without hunger
 food insecure with moderate hunger
 food insecure with severe hunger
Millions of children grow up in food-insecure households with inadequate diets due to both the
amount of available food and the quality of food. In the United States, about 20 percent of
households with children are food insecure to some degree. In half of those, only adults
experience food insecurity, while in the other half both adults and children are considered to be
food insecure, which means that children did not have access to adequate, nutritious meals at
times.15
Growing up in a food-insecure household can lead to a number of problems. Deficiencies in
iron, zinc, protein, and vitamin A can result in stunted growth, illness, and limited development.
Federal programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program,
and Summer Feeding Programs, work to address the risk of hunger and malnutrition in schoolaged children. They help to fill the gaps and provide children living in food-insecure households
with greater access to nutritious meals.16

School Lunch Programs17
Many school age children eat breakfast, snacks, and lunch at their schools. Therefore, it is
important for schools to provide meals that are nutritionally sound. In the United States,
more than thirty-one million children from low-income families are given meals provided by
the National School Lunch Program. This federally funded program offers low-cost or free

breakfast, snacks, and lunches to school facilities. School districts that take part receive
subsidies from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for every meal they serve that must
meet 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Knowing that many children in the United States buy or receive free lunches in the school

cafeteria, it might be worthwhile to look at the nutritional content of school lunches. You can
obtain this information through your local school district’s website. An example of a school
menu from a school district in north central Texas is a meal consisting of pasta alfredo, bread
stick, peach cup, tomato soup, a brownie, and 2% milk which is in compliance with Federal
Nutritional Guidelines. Consider another menu from an elementary school in the state of
Washington. This sample meal consists of chicken burger, tater tots, fruit, veggies, and 1% or
nonfat milk. This meal is also in compliance with Federal Nutrition Guidelines but has about
300 fewer calories than the menu in Texas. This is a big difference in calories and nutritional
value of these prepared lunches that are chosen and approved of by officials on behalf of
children in these districts.

Figure 10.6 – Children eating lunch together at school.18

Healthy School Lunch Campaigns helps to promote children’s health. This is done by
educating government officials, school officials, food-service workers, and parents and is
sponsored by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. They educate and
encourage schools to offer low-fat, cholesterol-free options in school cafeterias and in
vending machines and work to improve the food served to children at school. Unfortunately,
many school districts in the nation allow students to purchase chips, cookies, and ice cream
along with their meals. These districts rely on the sale of these items in the lunchrooms to
earn additional revenues. Not only are they making money off of children and families with
junk food, they are also adding additional empty calories to their daily intake. These districts
need to look at the menus and determine the rationale for offering additional snacks and
desserts for children at their schools. Whether children receive free lunches, buy their own,
or bring their lunch from home, quality nutrition is what is best for these growing bodies and
minds.

Food Allergies and Food Intolerance
Food intolerance and food allergies are an issue for some school-aged children. Recent studies
show that three million children under age eighteen are allergic to at least one type of food.
Some of the most common food allergies come from foods that include peanuts, milk, eggs,
soy, wheat, and shellfish. An allergy occurs when a protein in food triggers an immune
response, which results in the release of antibodies, histamine, and other defenders that attack
foreign bodies. Possible symptoms include itchy skin, hives, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea,
and nausea. Symptoms usually develop within minutes to hours after consuming a food
allergen. Children can outgrow a food allergy, especially allergies to wheat, milk, eggs, or soy.19
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction that results in difficulty breathing, swelling in the
mouth and throat, decreased blood pressure, shock, or even death. Milk, eggs, wheat,
soybeans, fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts are the most likely to trigger this type of
response. A dose of the drug epinephrine is often administered via a “pen” to treat a person
who goes into anaphylactic shock.20

Figure 10.7 – An EpiPen.21

Some children experience a food intolerance, which does not involve an immune response. A
food intolerance is marked by unpleasant symptoms that occur after consuming certain foods.
Lactose intolerance, though rare in very young children, is one example. Children who suffer
from this condition experience an adverse reaction to the lactose in milk products. It is a result
of the small intestine’s inability to produce enough of the enzyme lactase. Symptoms of lactose
intolerance usually affect the gastro-intestinal tract and can include bloating, abdominal pain,
gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance is best managed by making dietary changes and
avoiding any foods that trigger the reaction.22

Being Overweight and Obesity in Children
Excess weight and obesity in children is associated with a variety of medical conditions
including high blood pressure, insulin resistance, inflammation, depression, and lower academic
achievement (Lu, 2016). Being overweight has also been linked to impaired brain functioning,
which includes deficits in executive functioning, working memory, mental flexibility, and
decision making (Liang, Matheson, Kaye, & Boutelle, 2014). Children who ate more saturated
fats performed worse on relational memory tasks, while eating a diet high in omega-3 fatty
acids promoted relational memory skills (Davidson, 2014). Using animal studies, Davidson et al.
(2013) found that large amounts of processed sugars and saturated fat weakened the bloodbrain barrier, especially in the hippocampus. This can make the brain more vulnerable to
harmful substances that can impair its functioning. Another important executive functioning
skill is controlling impulses and delaying gratification. Children who are overweight show less
inhibitory control than normal weight children, which may make it more difficult for them to
avoid unhealthy foods (Lu, 2016). Overall, being overweight as a child increases the risk for
cognitive decline as one ages.

Figure 10.8 – There are certain health risks associated with being overweight.23

The current measurement for determining excess weight is the Body Mass Index (BMI) which
expresses the relationship of height to weight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), childrens whose BMI is at or above the 85th percentile for their age are
considered overweight, while children who are at or above the 95th percentile are considered
obese (Lu, 2016). In 2011-2012 approximately 8.4% of 2-5 year-olds were considered
overweight or obese, and 17.7% of 6-11 year-olds were overweight or obese (CDC, 2014b).24
Obesity Rates for Children: About 16 to 33 percent of American children are obese (U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2005). This is defined as being at least 20 percent
over their ideal weight. The percentage of obesity in school-aged children has increased

substantially since the 1960s and has in fact doubled since the 1980s. This is true in part
because of the introduction of a steady diet of television and other sedentary activities. In
addition, we have come to emphasize high fat, fast foods as a culture. Pizza, hamburgers,
chicken nuggets and “lunchables” with soda have replaced more nutritious foods as staples.
The decreased participation in school physical education and youth sports is just one of many
factors that has led to an increase in children being overweight or obese.

Being Overweight Can Be a Lifelong Struggle
A growing concern is the lack of recognition from parents that children are overweight or
obese. Katz (2015) referred to this as “oblivobesity”. Black et al. (2015) found that parents in
the United Kingdom (UK) only recognized their children as obese when they were above the
99.7th percentile while the official cut-off for obesity is at the 85th percentile. Oude Luttikhuis,
Stolk, and Sauer (2010) surveyed 439 parents and found that 75% of parents of overweight
children said the child had a normal weight and 50% of parents of obese children said the child
had a normal weight. For these parents, overweight was considered normal and obesity was
considered normal or a little heavy. Doolen, Alpert, and Miller (2009) reported on several
studies from the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, and the United States, and in all locations
parents were more likely to misperceive their children’s weight. Black, Park, and Gregson
(2015) concluded that as the average weight of children rises, what parents consider normal
also rises. If parents cannot identify if their children are overweight they will not be able to
intervene and assist their children with proper weight management.
An added concern is that the children themselves are not accurately identifying if they are
overweight. In a United States sample of 8-15 year-olds, more than 80% of overweight boys and
70% of overweight girls misperceived their weight as normal (Sarafrazi, Hughes, & Borrud,
2014). Also noted was that as the socioeconomic status of the children rose, the frequency of
these misconceptions decreased. It appeared that families with more resources were more
conscious of what defines a healthy weight.

Results of Childhood Obesity
Children who are overweight tend to be rejected, ridiculed, teased and bullied by others
(Stopbullying.gov, 2016). This can certainly be damaging to their self-image and popularity. In
addition, obese children run the risk of suffering orthopedic problems such as knee injuries, and
they have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke in adulthood (Lu, 2016). It is hard for a
child who is obese to become a non-obese adult. In addition, the number of cases of pediatric
diabetes has risen dramatically in recent years.
Behavioral interventions, including training children to overcome impulsive behavior, are being
researched to help overweight children (Lu, 2016). Practicing inhibition has been shown to
strengthen the ability to resist unhealthy foods. Parents can help their overweight children the
best when they are warm and supportive without using shame or guilt. They can also act like
the child’s frontal lobe until it is developed by helping them make correct food choices and
praising their efforts (Liang, et al., 2014). Research also shows that exercise, especially aerobic

248 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

exercise, can help improve cognitive functioning in overweight children (Lu, 2016). Parents
should take caution against emphasizing diet alone to avoid the development of any obsession
about dieting that can lead to eating disorders. Instead, increasing a child's activity level is most
helpful.
Dieting is not really the answer. If you diet, your basal metabolic rate tends to decrease thereby
making the body burn even fewer calories in order to maintain the weight. Increased activity is
much more effective in lowering the weight and improving the child’s health and psychological
well-being. Exercise reduces stress and being an overweight child, subjected to the ridicule of
others can certainly be stressful. Parents should take caution against emphasizing diet alone to
avoid the development of any obsession about dieting that can lead to eating disorders as
teens. Again, helping children to make healthy food choices and increasing physical activity will
help prevent childhood obesity.25

Exercise, Physical Fitness, and Sports
Recess and Physical Education: Recess is a time for free play and Physical Education (PE) is a
structured program that teaches skills, rules, and games. They’re a big part of physical fitness
for school age children. For many children, PE and recess are the key component in introducing
children to sports. After years of schools cutting back on recess and PE programs, there has
been a turn around, prompted by concerns over childhood obesity and the related health
issues. Despite these changes, currently only the state of Oregon and the District of Columbia
meet PE guidelines of a minimum of 150 minutes per week of physical activity in elementary
school and 225 minutes in middle school (SPARC, 2016).

Organized Sports: Pros and Cons
Middle childhood seems to be a great time to introduce children to organized sports, and in
fact, many parents do. Nearly 3 million children play soccer in the United States (United States
Youth Soccer, 2012). This activity promises to help children build social skills, improve
athletically and learn a sense of competition. However, the emphasis on competition and
athletic skill can be counterproductive and lead children to grow tired of the game and want to
quit. In many respects, it appears that children's activities are no longer children's activities
once adults become involved and approach the games as adults rather than children. The U. S.
Soccer Federation recently advised coaches to reduce the amount of drilling engaged in during
practice and to allow children to play more freely and to choose their own positions. The hope
is that this will build on their love of the game and foster their natural talents.
Sports are important for children. Children’s participation in sports has been linked to:
 Higher levels of satisfaction with family and overall quality of life in children
 Improved physical and emotional development
 Better academic performance
Yet, a study on children’s sports in the United States (Sabo & Veliz, 2008) has found that
gender, poverty, location, ethnicity, and disability can limit opportunities to engage in sports.
Girls were more likely to have never participated in any type of sport.
This study also found that fathers may not be providing their daughters as much support as
they do their sons. While boys rated their fathers as their biggest mentor who taught them the
most about sports, girls rated coaches and physical education teachers as their key mentors.
Sabo and Veliz also found that children in suburban neighborhoods had a much higher
participation in sports than boys and girls living in rural or urban centers. In addition, Caucasian
girls and boys participated in organized sports at higher rates than minority children. With a
renewed focus, males and females can benefit from all sports and physical activity.27

Welcome to the World of E-Sports
The recent Sport Policy and Research Collaborative (2016) report on the “State of Play” in the
United States highlights a disturbing trend. One in four children between the ages of 5 and 16
rate playing computer games with their friends as a form of exercise. In addition, e-sports,
which as SPARC writes is about as much a sport as poker, involves children watching other
children play video games. Over half of males, and about 20% of females, aged 12-19, say they
are fans of e-sports. Play is an important part of childhood and physical activity has been
proven to help children develop and grow. Adults and caregivers should look at what children
are doing within their day to prioritize the activities that should be focused on.29

Physical Health
Vision and Hearing
The most common vision problem in middle childhood is being nearsighted, otherwise known
as Myopic. 25% of children will be diagnosed by the end of middle childhood. Being nearsighted
can be corrected by wearing glasses with corrective lenses.

Children may have many ear infections in early childhood, but it’s not as common within the 612 year age range. Numerous ear infections during middle childhood may lead to headaches
and migraines, which may result in hearing loss.32

Dental Health
Children in middle childhood will start or continue to loose teeth. They experience the loss of
deciduous, or “baby,” teeth and the arrival of permanent teeth, which typically begins at age six
or seven. It is important for children to continue seeing a dentist twice a year to be sure that
these teeth are healthy.
The foods and nutrients that children consume are also important for dental health. Offer
healthy foods and snacks to children and when children do eat sugary or sticky foods, they
should brush their teeth afterward.

Figure 10.14 – A boy brushing his teeth.33

Children should floss daily and brush their teeth at least twice daily: in the morning, at bedtime,
and preferably after meals. Younger children need help brushing their teeth properly. Try
brushing their teeth first and letting them finish. You might try using a timer or a favorite song
so that your child learns to brush for 2 minutes. Parents or caregivers are encouraged to
supervise brushing until your child is 7 or 8 years old to avoid tooth decay.
The best defense against tooth decay is flossing, brushing and adding fluoride; a mineral found
in most tap water. If your water doesn’t have fluoride, ask a dentist about fluoride drops, gel or
varnish. Also ask your child’s dentist about sealants—a simple, pain-free way to prevent tooth
decay. These thin plastic coatings are painted on the chewing surfaces of permanent back

teeth. They quickly harden to form a protective shield against germs and food. If a small cavity
is accidentally covered by a sealant, the decay won’t spread because germs trapped inside are
sealed off from their food supply.
Children’s dental health needs continuous monitoring as children loose teeth and new teeth
come in. Many children have some malocclusion (when the way upper teeth aren’t correctly
positioned slightly over the lower teeth, including under- and overbites) or malposition of their
teeth, which can affect their ability to chew food, floss, and brush properly. Dentists may
recommend that it’s time to see an orthodontist to maintain proper dental health. Dental
health is exceedingly important as children grow more independent by making food choices
and as they start to take over flossing and brushing. Parents can ease this transition by
promoting healthy eating and proper dental hygiene.34

Diabetes in Childhood
Until recently diabetes in children and adolescents was thought of almost exclusively as type 1,
but that thinking has evolved. Type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in children
and is the result of a lack or production of insulin due to an overactive immune system. Type 2
diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in the U.S. It used to be referred to as adultonset diabetes as it was not common during childhood. But with increasing rates of overweight
and obesity in children and adolescents, more diagnoses are happening before adulthood. It is
also important to note that Type 2 disproportionately affects minority youth.35

Asthma
Childhood asthma that is unmanaged may make it difficult for children to develop to their
fullest potential. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways.
Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest
tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the
morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the
United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7 million of these
people are children.
To understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry
air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The
inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly
to certain inhaled substances. When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This
narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen,
making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual.
Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways. This chain reaction can
result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed.

Figure 10.16 - Figure A shows the location of the lungs and airways in the body. Figure B shows a cross-section of a
normal airway. Figure C shows a cross-section of an airway during asthma symptoms. 37

Sometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment
with asthma medicine. Other times, symptoms continue to get worse. When symptoms get
more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. Asthma attacks
also are called flare-ups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-BA-shuns).

Figure 10.17 – The different things that can trigger asthma. 38

Treating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent the
symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may
require emergency care, and they can be fatal. Asthma has no cure. Even when you feel fine,
you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time.
However, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to
manage the disease. They have few, if any, symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and
sleep through the night without interruption from asthma. If you have asthma, you can take an
active role in managing the disease. For successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build
strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers.39

Childhood Stress
Take a moment to think about how you deal with and how stress affects you. Now think about
what the impact of stress may have on a child and their development?
Of course children experience stress and different types of stressors differently. Not all stress is
bad. Normal, everyday stress can provide an opportunity for young children to build coping
skills and poses little risk to development. Even more long-lasting stressful events such as
changing schools or losing a loved one can be managed fairly well. But children who experience
toxic stress or who live in extremely stressful situations of abuse over long periods of time can

suffer long-lasting effects. The structures in the midbrain or limbic system such as the
hippocampus and amygdala can be vulnerable to prolonged stress during early childhood
(Middlebrooks and Audage, 2008). High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can reduce the
size of the hippocampus and effect the child’s memory abilities. Stress hormones can also
reduce immunity to disease. If the brain is exposed to long periods of severe stress it can
develop a low threshold making the child hypersensitive to stress in the future. Whatever the
effects of stress, it can be minimized if a child learns to deal with stressors and develop coping
strategies with the support of caring adults. It’s easy to know when your child has a fever or
other physical symptoms. However, a child’s mental health problems may be harder to identify.
In the next section, we’ll look at childhood Mental Health Disorders.40

Figure 10.18 – High, constant levels of stress can negatively impact the brain.41

Childhood Mental Health
Mental health problems can disrupt daily life at home, at school or in the community. Without
help, mental health problems can lead to school failure, alcohol or other drug abuse, family
discord, violence or even suicide. However, help is available. Talk to your health care provider if
you have concerns about your child’s behavior.
Mental health disorders are diagnosed by a qualified professional using the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This is a manual that is used as a standard across
the profession for diagnosing and treating mental disorders.42

When You Have a Concern About a Child. What’s in a Label?43
Children are continually evaluated as they enter and progress through school. If a child is
showing a need, they should be assessed by a qualified professional who would make a
recommendation or diagnosis of the child and give the type of instruction, resources,
accommodations, and support that they should receive.
Ideally, a proper diagnosis or label is extremely beneficial for children who have educational,
social, emotional, or developmental needs. Once their difficulty, disorder, or disability is
labeled then the child will receive the help they need from parents, educators and any other
professionals who will work as a team to meet the student’s individual goals and needs.
However, it’s important to consider that children that are labeled without proper support
and accommodations or worse they may be misdiagnosed will have negative consequences.
A label can also influence the child’s self-concept, for example, if a child is misdiagnosed as
having a learning disability; the child, teachers, and family member interpret their actions
through the lens of that label. Labels are powerful and can be good for the child or they can
go detrimental for their development all depending on the accuracy of the label and if they
are accurately applied.
A team of people who include parents, teachers, and any other support staff will look at the
child’s evaluation assessment in a process called an Individual Education Plan (IEP). The team
will discuss the diagnosis, recommendations, and the accommodations or help and a
decisions will be made regarding what is the best for the child. This is time when parents or
caregivers decide if they would like to follow this plan or they can dispute any part of the
process. During an IEP, the team is able to voice concerns and questions. Most parents feel
empowered when they leave these meetings. They feel as if they are a part of the team and
that they know what, when, why, and how their child will be helped.

Phobias
When a child who has a phobia (an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something) is
exposed to the phobic stimulus (the stimuli varies), it almost invariably provokes an immediate
anxiety response, which may take the form of a situational bound or situational predisposed
panic attack. Children can show effects and characteristics when it comes to specific phobias.
The effects of anxiety show up by crying, throwing tantrums, experiencing freezing, or clinging
to the parent that they have the most connection with. Related Conditions include anxiety.

Anxiety
Many children have fears and worries, and will feel sad and hopeless from time to time. Strong
fears will appear at different times during development. For example, toddlers are often very
distressed about being away from their parents, even if they are safe and cared for. Although
fears and worries are typical in children, persistent or extreme forms of fear and sadness
feelings could be due to anxiety or depression. Because the symptoms primarily involve
thoughts and feelings, they are called internalizing disorders.

Figure 10.19 – An anxious child.45

When children do not outgrow the fears and worries that are typical in young children, or when
there are so many fears and worries that interfere with school, home, or play activities, the
child may be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Examples of different types of anxiety
disorders include:
 Being very afraid when away from parents (separation anxiety)
 Having extreme fear about a specific thing or situation, such as dogs, insects, or going to
the doctor (phobias)
 Being very afraid of school and other places where there are people (social anxiety)
 Being very worried about the future and about bad things happening (general anxiety)
 Having repeated episodes of sudden, unexpected, intense fear that come with
symptoms like heart pounding, having trouble breathing, or feeling dizzy, shaky, or
sweaty (panic disorder)
45

Anxiety may present as fear or worry, but can also make children irritable and angry. Anxiety
symptoms can also include trouble sleeping, as well as physical symptoms like fatigue,
headaches, or stomachaches. Some anxious children keep their worries to themselves and,
thus, the symptoms can be missed.
Related conditions include Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD)
Exposure to traumatic events can have major developmental influences on children. While the
majority of children will not develop PTSD after a trauma, best estimates from the literature are
that around a third of them will, higher than adult estimates. Some reasons for this could
include more limited knowledge about the world, differential coping mechanisms employed,
and the fact that children’s reactions to trauma are often highly influenced by how their
parents and caregivers react.
The impact of PTSD on children weeks after a trauma, show that up to 90% of children may
experience heightened physiological arousal, diffuse anxiety, survivor guilt, and emotional
liability. These are all normal reactions and should be understood as such (similar things are
seen in adults. Those children still having these symptoms three or four months after a
disaster, however, may be in need of further assessment, particularly if they show the following
symptoms as well. For older children, warning signs of problematic adjustment include:
repetitious play reenacting a part of the disaster; preoccupation with danger or expressed
concerns about safety; sleep disturbances and irritability; anger outbursts or aggressiveness;
excessive worry about family or friends; school avoidance, particularly involving somatic
complaints; behaviors characteristic of younger children; and changes in personality,
withdrawal, and loss of interest in activities.46

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Although a diagnosis of OCD requires only that a person either has obsessions or compulsions,
not both, approximately 96% of people experience both. For almost all people with OCD, being
exposed to a certain stimuli (internal or external) will then trigger an upsetting or anxietycausing obsession, which can only be relieved by doing a compulsion. For example, a person
touches a doorknob in a public building, which causes an obsessive thought that they will get
sick from the germs, which can only be relieved by compulsively washing their hands to an
excessive degree. Some of the most common obsessions include unwanted thoughts of
harming loved ones, persistent doubts that one has not locked doors or switched off electrical
appliances, intrusive thoughts of being contaminated, and morally or sexually repugnant.47

Depression
Occasionally being sad or feeling hopeless is a part of every child’s life. However, some children
feel sad or uninterested in things that they used to enjoy, or feel helpless or hopeless in
situations where they could do something to address the situations. When children feel
persistent sadness and hopelessness, they may be diagnosed with depression.

Figure 10.20 – Persistent sadness is a symptom of depression.48

Symptoms
We now know that youth who have depression may show signs that are slightly different from
the typical adult symptoms of depression. Children who are depressed may complain of feeling
sick, refuse to go to school, cling to a parent or caregiver, feel unloved, hopelessness about the
future, or worry excessively that a parent may die. Older children and teens may sulk, get into
trouble at school, be negative or grouchy, are irritable, indecisive, have trouble concentrating,
or feel misunderstood. Because normal behaviors vary from one childhood stage to another, it
can be difficult to tell whether a child who shows changes in behavior is just going through a
temporary “phase” or is suffering from depression.
Treatment
With medication, psychotherapy, or combined treatment, most youth with depression can be
effectively treated. Youth are more likely to respond to treatment if they receive it early in the
course of their illness.49

Developmental Disorders
Autism Spectrum Disorder
As introduced in chapter 8, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that
affects communication and behavior. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is said to
be a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a guide
created by the American Psychiatric Association used to diagnose mental disorders, people with
ASD have:
 Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people
 Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors
 Symptoms that hurt the person’s ability to function properly in school, work, and other
areas of life
Autism is known as a “spectrum” disorder because there is wide variation in the type and
severity of symptoms people experience. ASD occurs in all ethnic, racial, and economic groups.
Although ASD can be a lifelong disorder, treatments and services can improve a person’s
symptoms and ability to function. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all
children be screened for autism.

Changes to the diagnosis of ASD
In 2013, a revised version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) was released. This revision changed the way autism is classified and diagnosed. Using the
previous version of the DSM, people could be diagnosed with one of several separate
conditions:
 Autistic disorder
 Asperger’s’ syndrome
 Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)
In the current revised version of the DSM (the DSM-5), these separate conditions have been
combined into one diagnosis called “autism spectrum disorder.” Using the DSM-5, for example,
people who were previously diagnosed as having Asperger’s syndrome would now be
diagnosed as having autism spectrum disorder. Although the “official” diagnosis of ASD has
changed, there is nothing wrong with continuing to use terms such as Asperger’s syndrome to
describe oneself or to identify with a peer group.

Signs and Symptoms of ASD
People with ASD have difficulty with social communication and interaction, restricted interests,
and repetitive behaviors. The list below gives some examples of the types of behaviors that are
seen in people diagnosed with ASD. Not all people with ASD will show all behaviors, but most
will show several.
Social communication / interaction behaviors may include:
 Making little or inconsistent eye contact
 Tending not to look at or listen to people
 Rarely sharing enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing or showing things to others
 Failing to, or being slow to, respond to someone calling their name or to other verbal
attempts to gain attention
 Having difficulties with the back and forth of conversation
261 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t






Often talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not
interested or without giving others a chance to respond
Having facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is being
said
Having an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-like
Having trouble understanding another person’s point of view or being unable to predict
or understand other people’s actions

Restrictive / repetitive behaviors may include:
 Repeating certain behaviors or having unusual behaviors. For example, repeating words
or phrases, a behavior called echolalia
 Having a lasting intense interest in certain topics, such as numbers, details, or facts
 Having overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or parts of objects
 Getting upset by slight changes in a routine
 Being more or less sensitive than other people to sensory input, such as light, noise,
clothing, or temperature
People with ASD may also experience sleep problems and irritability. Although people with ASD
experience many challenges, they may also have many strengths, including:
 Being able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time
 Being strong visual and auditory learners
 Excelling in math, science, music, or art

Causes and Risk Factors
While scientists don’t know the exact causes of ASD, research suggests that genes can act
together with influences from the environment to affect development in ways that lead to ASD.
Although scientists are still trying to understand why some people develop ASD and others
don’t, some risk factors include:
 Having a sibling with ASD
 Having older parents
 Having certain genetic conditions—people with conditions such as Down syndrome,
fragile X syndrome, and Rett syndrome are more likely than others to have ASD
 Very low birth weight
Treatments and Therapies
Treatment for ASD should begin as soon as possible after diagnosis. Early treatment for ASD is
important as proper care can reduce individuals’ difficulties while helping them learn new skills
and make the most of their strengths.
The wide range of issues facing people with ASD means that there is no single best treatment
for ASD. Working closely with a doctor or health care professional is an important part of
finding the right treatment program.

262 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

A doctor may use medication to treat some symptoms that are common with ASD. With
medication, a person with ASD may have fewer problems with:
 Irritability
 Aggression
 Repetitive behavior
 Hyperactivity
 Attention problems
 Anxiety and depression
People with ASD may be referred to doctors who specialize in providing behavioral,
psychological, educational, or skill-building interventions. These programs are typically highly
structured and intensive and may involve parents, siblings, and other family members.
Programs may help people with ASD:
 Learn life-skills necessary to live independently
 Reduce challenging behaviors
 Increase or build upon strengths
 Learn social, communication, and language skills50

Figure 10.21 - Rich and Nubia Quick have put their autistic 8-year-old son, Matthew, through therapy to help him
open up and relate more to others. The Quicks maintain a structured environment so Matthew can better adjust
to the world around him.51

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD)
The exact causes of AD/HD are unknown; however, research has demonstrated that factors
that many people associate with the development of AD/HD do not cause the disorder
including, minor head injuries, damage to the brain from complications during birth, food
allergies, excess sugar intake, too much television, poor schools, or poor parenting. Research
has found a number of significant risk factors affecting neurodevelopment and behavior

expression. Events such as maternal alcohol and tobacco use that affect the development of
the fetal brain can increase the risk for AD/HD. Injuries to the brain from environmental toxins
such as lack of iron have also been implicated.

Symptoms
People with AD/HD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity–
impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development:
1. Inattention: Six or more symptoms of inattention for children up to age 16, or five or
more for adolescents 17 and older and adults; symptoms of inattention have been
present for at least 6 months, and they are inappropriate for developmental level:
 Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in
schoolwork, at work, or with other activities.
 Often has trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities.
 Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.
 Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores,
or duties in the workplace (e.g., loses focus, side-tracked).
 Often has trouble organizing tasks and activities.
 Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort over a
long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework).
 Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities (e.g. school materials, pencils,
books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).
 Is often easily distracted
 Is often forgetful in daily activities.

2. Hyperactivity and Impulsivity: Six or more symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity for
children up to age 16, or five or more for adolescents 17 and older and adults;
symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have been present for at least 6 months to an
extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for the person’s developmental level:
 Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat.

Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected.
Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate (adolescents or
adults may be limited to feeling restless).

Is often “on the go” acting as if “driven by a motor”.
Often talks excessively.
Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed.
Often has trouble waiting his/her turn.
Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games)

Figure 10.23 – This child is exhibiting hyperactivity and impulsivity.53

In addition, the following conditions must be met:
 Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before age 12
years.
 Several symptoms are present in two or more settings, (such as at home, school or
work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).
 There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of,
social, school, or work functioning.
 The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (such as a mood
disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, or a personality disorder). The
symptoms do not happen only during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic
disorder.
Based on the types of symptoms, three kinds (presentations) of AD/HD can occur:
 Combined Presentation: if enough symptoms of both criteria inattention and
hyperactivity-impulsivity were present for the past 6 months
 Predominantly Inattentive Presentation: if enough symptoms of inattention, but not
hyperactivity-impulsivity, were present for the past six months



Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation: if enough symptoms of
hyperactivity-impulsivity, but not inattention, were present for the past six months.

Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may change over time as well.54
The diagnosis of AD/HD can be made reliably using well-tested diagnostic interview methods.
However, as of yet, there is no independent valid test for ADHD.
Among children, AD/HD frequently occurs along with other learning, behavior, or mood
problems such as learning disabilities, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and
depression.

Treatment
A variety of medications and behavioral interventions are used to treat AD/HD. The most widely
used medications are methylphenidate (Ritalin), D-amphetamine, and other amphetamines.
These drugs are stimulants that affect the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine at the
synapse. Nine out of 10 children improve while taking one of these drugs.

Figure 10.24 – Brain scans of brains with and without ADHD.55

In addition to the well-established treatments described above, some parents and therapists
have tried a variety of nutritional interventions to treat AD/HD. A few studies have found that
some children benefit from such treatments. Nevertheless, no well-established nutritional
interventions have consistently been shown to be effective for treating AD/HD.56

Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) or PPD (NOS) Not Otherwise Specified PDD –NOS
Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) is a term used to refer to difficulties in socialization
and delays in developing communicative skills. This is usually recognized before 3 years of age.
A child with PDD may interact in unusual ways with toys, people, or situations, and may engage

in repetitive movement. PDD is diagnosed and treatment is similar to ADHA and ASD. In 2013
the DSM- 5 discontinued using this as a diagnosis, however it is still used informally.57

Managing Symptoms: Staying Healthy
Being healthy is important for all children and can be especially important for children with
mental health disorders. In addition to getting the right treatment, leading a healthy lifestyle
can play a role in managing symptoms. Here are some healthy behaviors that may help:
 Eating a healthful diet centered on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (for
example, beans, peas, and lentils), lean protein sources, and nuts and seeds
 Participating in physical activity for at least 60 minutes each day
 Getting the recommended amount of sleep each night based on age
 Practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques58

Figure 10.25 – Staying healthy is critical for all children, especially those who may have mental health disorders. 59

Conclusion
In this chapter we looked at:
 Patterns of growth in the brain and body
 Health and nutrition
 Causes and results of obesity
 Exercise, fitness, and organized sports
 Physical health concerns
 Mental health disorders
In the next chapter we will be examining cognitive development theories and theorists. We will

Chapter 11: Middle Childhood – Cognitive
Development
Chapter Objectives
After this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Describe what cognitive theorists share about children and their thinking
2. Explain how intelligence is measured, the tests used to assess intelligence, the extremes
in intelligence, and the concern of bias
3. Describe the Information Processing Theory
4. Explain several theories of language development
5. Compare typical language development with language difficulties

Introduction
Cognitive skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood. Children in middle childhood
have thought processes that become more logical and organized when dealing with concrete
information. Children at this age understand concepts such as past, present, and future, giving
them the ability to plan and work toward goals. Additionally, they can process complex ideas
such as addition and subtraction and cause-and effect relationships.1

Cognitive Theories of Intelligence
Theorists are able to give different perspectives to the cognitive development of children and
psychologists have long debated how to best conceptualize and measure intelligence
(Sternberg, 2003). In the next section we’ll look at Piaget’s theory of cognitive development,
Sternberg’s alternative view to intelligence, and Gardener’s theory of multiple intelligence.
Lastly, you’ll learn about the Information Processing Theory that looks at the cognitive function
of children in middle childhood.

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development
Concrete Operational Thought
As children continue into elementary school, they develop the ability to represent ideas and
events more flexibly and logically. Their rules of thinking still seem very basic by adult standards
and usually operate unconsciously, but they allow children to solve problems more
systematically than before, and therefore to be successful with many academic tasks. In the
concrete operational stage, for example, a child may unconsciously follow the rule: “If nothing
is added or taken away, then the amount of something stays the same.” This simple principle
helps children to understand certain arithmetic tasks, such as in adding or subtracting zero from
a number, as well as to do certain classroom science experiments, such as ones involving
judgments of the amounts of liquids when mixed. Piaget called this period the concrete
operational stage because children mentally “operate” on concrete objects and events.3

Figure 11.2 – Children studying.4

The concrete operational stage is defined as the third in Piaget's theory of cognitive
development. This stage takes place around 7 years old to 11 years of age, and is characterized
by the development of organized and rational thinking. Piaget (1954a) considered the concrete
stage a major turning point in the child's cognitive development, because it marks the
beginning of logical or operational thought. The child is now mature enough to use logical
thought or operations (i.e. rules) but can only apply logic to physical objects (hence concrete
operational). Children gain the abilities of conservation (number, area, volume, orientation) and
reversibility.5

Let’s look at the following cognitive skills that children typically master during Piaget’s concrete
operational stage.6 :

Figure 11.3 – The cognitive skills developed during the concrete operational stage. 7

Seriation: Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a
methodical way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can
methodically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children
approach a similar task in a haphazard way.8

Classification: As children's experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schema and are able
to organize objects in many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies and
can arrange objects into a variety of classes and subclasses.

Figure 11.5 – This child might use classification if she sorts these toys by color.10

Reversibility: The child learns that some things that have been changed can be returned to
their original state. Water can be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again. But eggs
cannot be unscrambled. Arithmetic operations are reversible as well: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 – 3 = 2.
Many of these cognitive skills are incorporated into the school's curriculum through
mathematical problems and in worksheets about which situations are reversible or irreversible.

Figure 11.6 – Understanding that ice cubes melt is an example of reversibility.11

Conservation: An example of the preoperational child’s thinking; if you were to fill a tall beaker
with 8 ounces of water this child would think that it was "more" than a short, wide bowl filled
with 8 ounces of water? Concrete operational children can understand the concept of
conservation, which means that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level)
can be compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same
amount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter
and wider.

Figure 11.7 – Beakers displaying the idea of conservation. 12

Decentration: Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any
object (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions
too (such as the width of the glass). This allows for conservation to occur.

Figure 11.8 – Children looking at these glasses demonstrate decentration when looking at more than one attribute
i.e. tall, short, and wide narrow.13

Identity: One feature of concrete operational thought is the understanding that objects have
qualities that do not change even if the object is altered in some way. For instance, mass of an
object does not change by rearranging it. A piece of chalk is still chalk even when the piece is
broken in two. 14

Figure 11.9 – A broken egg is
still an egg.15

Figure 11.10 – A deflated
balloon is still a balloon.16

Figure 11.11 – Broken chalk is
still chalk.17

Transitivity: Being able to understand how objects are related to one another is referred to as
transitivity, or transitive inference. This means that if one understands that a dog is a mammal,
and that a boxer is a dog, then a boxer must be a mammal.18

Figure 11.12 - Transitivity allows children to understand that this boxer puppy, is a dog and a mammal.19

Looking at Piaget’s Theory
Researchers have obtained findings indicating that cognitive development is considerably more
continuous than Piaget claimed. Thus, the debate between those who emphasize

discontinuous, stage-like changes in cognitive development and those who emphasize gradual
continuous changes remains a lively one.20

Triarchic Theory of Intelligence
An alternative view of intelligence is presented by Sternberg (1997; 1999). Sternberg offers
three types of intelligences. Sternberg provided background information about his view of
intelligence in a conference, where he described his frustration as a committee member
charged with selecting graduate students for a program in psychology. He was concerned that
there was too much emphasis placed on aptitude test scores (we will discuss this later in the
chapter) and believed that there were other, less easily measured, qualities necessary for
success in a graduate program and in the world of work. Aptitude test scores indicate the first
type of intelligence-academic
1. Analytical (componential) sometimes described as academic: includes the ability to
solve problems of logic, verbal comprehension, vocabulary, and spatial abilities.
2. Creative (experiential): the ability to apply newly found skills to novel situations
3. Practical (contextual): the ability to use common sense and to know what is called for in
a situation. 21

Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences
Another champion of the idea of specific types of intelligences rather than one overall
intelligence is the psychologist Howard Gardner (1983, 1999). Gardner argued that it would be
evolutionarily functional for different people to have different talents and skills, and proposed
that there are nine intelligences that can be differentiated from each other.

Figure 11.16 – Howard Gardner.25

Gardner contends that these are also forms of intelligence. A high IQ does not always ensure
success in life or necessarily indicate that a person has common sense, good interpersonal
skills, or other abilities important for success. Gardner investigated intelligences by focusing on
children who were talented in one or more areas. He identified these 9 intelligences based on
other criteria including a set developmental history and psychometric findings.26
Howard Gardner (1983, 1998, 1999) suggests that there are not one, but nine domains of
intelligence. The first three are skills that are measured by IQ tests:

Naturalistic
Existential

Description
The ability to recognize, identify, and understand animals, plants, and
other living things
The ability to understand and have concern from life’s larger questions,
the meaning of life, and other spiritual matters

The concept of multiple intelligences has been influential in the field of education, and teachers
have used these ideas to try to teach differently for individual students. For instance, to teach
math problems to students who have particularly good kinesthetic intelligence, a teacher might
encourage the students to move their bodies or hands according to the numbers. On the other
hand, some have argued that these “intelligences” sometimes seem more like “abilities” or
“talents” rather than real intelligence. There is no clear conclusion about how many
intelligences there are. Are a sense of humor, artistic skills, dramatic skills, and so forth also
separate intelligences?28

Information Processing: Learning, Memory, and Problem Solving
During middle and late childhood children make strides in several areas of cognitive function
including the capacity of working memory, their ability to pay attention, and their use of
memory strategies. Both changes in the brain and experience foster these abilities.
In this section, we will look at how children process information, think and learn, allowing them
to increase their ability to learn and remember due to an improvement in the ways they attend
to, store information, and problem solve.29
Working Memory: The capacity of working memory expands during middle and late childhood,
research has suggested that both an increase in processing speed and the ability to inhibit
irrelevant information from entering memory are contributing to the greater efficiency of
working memory during this age (de Ribaupierre, 2002). Changes in myelination and synaptic
pruning in the cortex are likely behind the increase in processing speed and ability to filter out
irrelevant stimuli (Kail, McBride-Chang, Ferrer, Cho, & Shu, 2013).

Figure 11.17 – Working memory expands during middle and late childhood.30

Attention: As noted above, the ability to inhibit irrelevant information improves during this age
group, with there being a sharp improvement in selective attention from age six into
adolescence (Vakil, Blachstein, Sheinman, & Greenstein, 2009). Children also improve in their
ability to shift their attention between tasks or different features of a task (Carlson, Zelazo, &
Faja, 2013). A younger child who is asked to sort objects into piles based on type of object, car
versus animal, or color of object, red versus blue, would likely have no trouble doing so. But if
you ask them to switch from sorting based on type to now having them sort based on color,
they would struggle because this requires them to suppress the prior sorting rule. An older child
has less difficulty making the switch, meaning there is greater flexibility in their intentional
skills. These changes in attention and working memory contribute to children having more
strategic approaches to challenging tasks.
Memory Strategies: Bjorklund (2005) describes a developmental progression in the acquisition
and use of memory strategies. Such strategies are often lacking in younger children, but
increase in frequency as children progress through elementary school. Examples of memory
strategies include rehearsing information you wish to recall, visualizing and organizing
information, creating rhymes, such as “i” before “e” except after “c”, or inventing acronyms,
30

277 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

such as “roygbiv” to remember the colors of the rainbow. Schneider, Kron-Sperl, and
Hünnerkopf (2009) reported a steady increase in the use of memory strategies from ages six to
ten in their longitudinal study. Moreover, by age ten many children were using two or more
memory strategies to help them recall information. Schneider and colleagues found that there
were considerable individual differences at each age in the use of strategies, and that children
who utilized more strategies had better memory performance than their same aged peers.

Cognitive Processes
As children enter school and learn more about the world, they develop more categories for
concepts and learn more efficient strategies for storing and retrieving information. One
significant reason is that they continue to have more experiences on which to tie new
information. In other words, their knowledge base, knowledge in particular areas that makes
learning new information easier, expands (Berger, 2014).

Figure 11.18 – As children learn more about the world, their knowledge base grows.31

Metacognition: refers to the knowledge we have about our own thinking and our ability to use
this awareness to regulate our own cognitive processes (Bruning, Schraw, Norby, & Ronning,
2004). Children in this developmental stage also have a better understanding of how well they
are performing a task, and the level of difficulty of a task. As they become more realistic about
their abilities, they can adapt studying strategies to meet those needs. Young children spend as
much time on an unimportant aspect of a problem as they do on the main point, while older
children start to learn to prioritize and gauge what is significant and what is not. As a result,
they develop metacognition.
Critical thinking, or a detailed examination of beliefs, courses of action, and evidence, involves
teaching children how to think. The purpose of critical thinking is to evaluate information in
ways that help us make informed decisions. Critical thinking involves better understanding a
problem through gathering, evaluating, and selecting information, and also by considering
many possible solutions. Ennis (1987) identified several skills useful in critical thinking. These
include: Analyzing arguments, clarifying information, judging the credibility of a source, making

value judgments, and deciding on an action. Metacognition is essential to critical thinking
because it allows us to reflect on the information as we make decisions.
Children differ in their cognitive process and these differences predict both their readiness for
school, academic performance, and testing in school. (Prebler, Krajewski, & Hasselhorn,
2013).32

Intelligence Testing: The What, the Why, and the Who
Measuring Intelligence: Standardization and the Intelligence Quotient
The goal of most intelligence tests is to measure “g”, the general intelligence factor. Good
intelligence tests are reliable, meaning that they are consistent over time, and also
demonstrate validity, meaning that they actually measure intelligence rather than something
else. Because intelligence is such an important part of individual differences, psychologists have
invested substantial effort in creating and improving measures of intelligence, and these tests
are now considered the most accurate of all psychological tests.
Intelligence changes with age. A 3-year-old who could accurately multiply 183 by 39 would
certainly be intelligent, but a 25-year-old who could not do so would be seen as unintelligent.
Thus understanding intelligence requires that we know the norms or standards in a given
population of people at a given age. The standardization of a test involves giving it to a large
number of people at different ages and computing the average score on the test at each age
level.
Once the standardization has been accomplished, we have a picture of the average abilities of
people at different ages and can calculate a person’s mental age, which is the age at which a
person is performing intellectually. If we compare the mental age of a person to the person’s
chronological age, the result is the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), a measure of intelligence that is
adjusted for age. A simple way to calculate IQ is by using the following formula:
IQ = mental age ÷ chronological age × 100.
Thus a 10-year-old child who does as well as the average 10-year-old child has an IQ of 100 (10
÷ 10 × 100), whereas an 8-year-old child who does as well as the average 10-year-old child
would have an IQ of 125 (10 ÷ 8 × 100). Most modern intelligence tests are based on the
relative position of a person’s score among people of the same age, rather than on the basis of
this formula, but the idea of intelligence “ratio” or “quotient” provides a good description of
the score’s meaning.

The Flynn Effect
It is important that intelligence tests be standardized on a regular basis, because the overall
level of intelligence in a population may change over time. The Flynn effect refers to the
observation that scores on intelligence tests worldwide have increased substantially over the
past decades (Flynn, 1999). Although the increase varies somewhat from country to country,
the average increase is about 3 IQ points every 10 years. There are many explanations for the
Flynn effect, including better nutrition, increased access to information, and more familiarity
with multiple-choice tests (Neisser, 1998). But whether people are actually getting smarter is
debatable (Neisser,1997). 33

The Value of IQ Testing
The value of IQ testing is most evident in educational or clinical settings. Children who seem to
be experiencing learning difficulties or severe behavioral problems can be tested to ascertain
whether the child’s difficulties can be partly attributed to an IQ score that is significantly
different from the mean for her age group. Without IQ testing—or another measure of
intelligence—children and adults needing extra support might not be identified effectively.
People also use IQ testing results to seek disability benefits from the Social Security
Administration.
While IQ tests have sometimes been used as arguments in support of insidious purposes, such
as the eugenics movement, which was the science of improving a human population by
controlled breeding to increase desirable heritable characteristics. However, the value of this
test is important to help those in need.34

Intelligence Tests and Those Who Created Them
Alfred Binet & Théodore Simon - Stanford- Binet Intelligence Test
From 1904- 1905 the French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857–1914) and his colleague Théodore
Simon (1872–1961) began working on behalf of the French government to develop a measure
that would identify children who would not be successful with the regular school curriculum.
The goal was to help teachers better educate these students (Aiken, 1994).
Binet and Simon developed what most psychologists today regard as the first intelligence test,
which consisted of a wide variety of questions that included the ability to name objects, define
words, draw pictures, complete sentences, compare items, and construct sentences. Binet and
Simon (Binet, Simon, & Town, 1915; Siegler, 1992) believed that the questions they asked the
children all assessed the basic abilities to understand, reason, and make judgments.

Intelligence Scale. Children being tested were asked which face, of each pair, was prettier. 35

Soon after Binet and Simon introduced their test, the American psychologist Lewis Terman at
Stanford University (1877–1956) developed an American version of Binet’s test that became
known as the Stanford- Binet Intelligence Test. The Stanford-Binet is a measure of general
intelligence made up of a wide variety of tasks including vocabulary, memory for pictures,
naming of familiar objects, repeating sentences, and following commands.36

David Wechsler- Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale
In 1939, David Wechsler, a psychologist who spent part of his career working with World War I
veterans, developed a new IQ test in the United States. Wechsler combined several subtests
from other intelligence tests used between 1880 and World War I. These subtests tapped into a
variety of verbal and nonverbal skills, because Wechsler believed that intelligence
encompassed “the global capacity of a person to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to
deal effectively with his environment” (Wechsler, 1958, p. 7). He named the test the WechslerBellevue Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1981). This combination of subtests became one of the
most extensively used intelligence tests in the history of psychology.

Today, there are three intelligence tests credited to Wechsler, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale-fourth edition (WAIS-IV), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), and the
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—Revised (WPPSI-III) (Wechsler, 2002).
These tests are used widely in schools and communities throughout the United States, and they
are periodically normed and standardized as a means of recalibration.

Bias of IQ Testing
Intelligence tests and psychological definitions of intelligence have been heavily criticized since
the 1970s for being biased in favor of Anglo-American, middle-class respondents and for being
inadequate tools for measuring non-academic types of intelligence or talent. Intelligence
changes with experience, and intelligence quotients or scores do not reflect that ability to
change. What is considered smart varies culturally as well, and most intelligence tests do not
take this variation into account. For example, in the West, being smart is associated with being
quick. A person who answers a question the fastest is seen as the smartest, but in some
cultures being smart is associated with considering an idea thoroughly before giving an answer.
A well- thought out, contemplative answer is the best answer.38

A Spectrum of Intellectual Development
The results of studies assessing the measurement of intelligence show that IQ is distributed in
the population in the form of a Normal Distribution (or bell curve), which is the pattern of
scores usually observed in a variable that clusters around its average. In a normal distribution,
the bulk of the scores fall toward the middle, with many fewer scores falling at the extremes.
The normal distribution of intelligence shows that on IQ tests, as well as on most other
measures, the majority of people cluster around the average (in this case, where IQ = 100), and
fewer are either very smart or very dull (see below).

Figure 11.21 - The majority of people have an IQ score between 85 and 115.39

Distribution of IQ Scores in the General Population
This means that about 2% of people score above an IQ of 130, often considered the threshold
for giftedness, and about the same percentage score below an IQ of 70, often being considered
the threshold for an intellectual disability.

Intellectual Disabilities
One end of the distribution of intelligence scores is defined by people with very low IQ.
Intellectual disability (or intellectual developmental disorder) is assessed based on cognitive
capacity (IQ) and adaptive functioning. The severity of the disability is based on adaptive
functioning, or how well the person handles everyday life tasks. About 1% of the United States
population, most of them males, fulfill the criteria for intellectual developmental disorder, but
some children who are given this diagnosis lose the classification as they get older and better
learn to function in society. A particular vulnerability of people with low IQ is that they may be
taken advantage of by others, and this is an important aspect of the definition of intellectual
developmental disorder (Greenspan, Loughlin, & Black, 2001).
One example of an intellectual developmental disorder is Down syndrome, a chromosomal
disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. The incidence of
Down syndrome is estimated at approximately 1 per 700 births, and the prevalence increases
as the mother’s age increases (CDC, 2014a). People with Down syndrome typically exhibit a
distinctive pattern of physical features, including a flat nose, upwardly slanted eye, a protruding
tongue, and a short neck.

Figure 11.22 – Down Syndrome is caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome.40

Fortunately, societal attitudes toward individuals with intellectual disabilities have changed
over the past decades. We no longer use terms such as “retarded,” “moron,” “idiot,” or
“imbecile” to describe people with intellectual differences, although these were the official
psychological terms used to describe degrees of what was referred to as mental retardation in
40

the past. Laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have made it illegal to
discriminate on the basis of mental and physical disability.
The normal distribution of IQ scores in the general population shows that most people have
about average intelligence, while very few have extremely high or extremely low intelligence.41

Giftedness
Being gifted refers to children who have an IQ of 130 or higher (Lally & Valentine-French, 2015).
Having an extremely high IQ is clearly less of a problem than having an extremely low IQ but
there may also be challenges to being particularly smart. It is often assumed that school
children who are labeled as “gifted” may have adjustment problems that make it more difficult
for them to create and maintain social relationships.

Figure 11.23 – Children who get a score on an intelligence test
showing an IQ of 130 or higher are labeled as gifted. 42

As you might expect based on our discussion of intelligence, there are also different types and
areas of intelligence and giftedness. Some children are particularly good at math or science,
some at automobile repair or carpentry, some at music or art, some at sports or leadership, and
so on. There is a lively debate among scholars about whether it is appropriate or beneficial to
label some children as “gifted and talented” in school and to provide them with accelerated
special classes and other programs that are not available to everyone. Although doing so may
help the gifted kids (Colangelo & Assouline, 2009), it also may isolate them from their peers and
make such provisions unavailable to those who are not classified as “gifted.” Testing for high IQ
or for disabilities needs to be critically looked at so that the good that these tests were created
for are not used for undesirable purposes.43
How do we know so much about what children learn in schools? In the next section we’ll look
at the different types of tests and what the schools are testing.

Testing in Schools
Children's academic performance is often measured with the use of standardized tests. Those
tests include, but are not limited to Achievement and Aptitude tests.

Figure 11.24 – Standardized tests are used to measure academic performance.44

Achievement tests are used to measure what a child has already learned. Achievement tests
are often used as measures of teaching effectiveness within a school setting and as a method to
make schools that receive tax dollars (such as public schools, charter schools, and private
schools that receive vouchers) accountable to the government for their performance.
Aptitude tests are designed to measure a student’s ability to learn or to determine if a person
has potential in a particular program. These are often used at the beginning of a course of study
or as part of college entrance requirements. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and Preliminary
Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT) are perhaps the most familiar aptitude tests to students in
grades 6 and above. Learning test taking skills and preparing for SATs has become part of the
training that some students in these grades receive as part of their pre-college
preparation. Other aptitude tests include the MCAT (Medical College Admission Test), the LSAT
(Law School Admission Test), and the GRE (Graduate Record Examination). Intelligence tests are
also a form of aptitude test, which designed to measure a person’s ability to learn.45

What Happened to No Child Left Behind?
In 2001, President Bush signed into effect Public Law 107-110, better known as the No Child
Left Behind Act mandating that schools administer achievement tests to students and publish
those results so that parents have an idea of their children's performance. Additionally, the
government would have information on the gaps in educational achievement between children
from various social class, racial, and ethnic groups.
Schools that showed significant gaps in these levels of performance were mandated to work
toward narrowing these gaps. Educators criticized the policy for focusing too much on testing

as the only indication of student performance. Target goals were considered unrealistic and set
by the federal government rather than individual states. Because these requirements became
increasingly unworkable for schools, changes to the law were requested.

Figure 11.25 – The No Child Left Behind Act was signed
into effect in 2001.46

Figure 11.26 – The Every Student Succeeds Act was

On December 12, 2015 President Obama signed into law the Every Student Succeeds Act
(ESSA). This law is state driven and focuses on expanding educational opportunities and
improving student outcomes, including in the areas of high school graduation, drop-out rates,
and college attendance.48

Language Development in the School-Age Child
Human language is the most complex behavior on the planet and, at least as far as we know, in
the universe. Language involves both the ability to comprehend (receptive) spoken and written
(expressive) words and to create communication in real time when we speak or write. Most
languages are oral, generated through speaking. Speaking involves a variety of complex
cognitive, social, and biological processes including operation of the vocal cords, and the
coordination of breath with movements of the throat and mouth, and tongue. Other languages
are sign languages, in which the communication is expressed by movements of the hands. The
most common sign language is American Sign Language (ASL), currently spoken by more than
500,000 people in the United States alone.
Although language is often used for the transmission of information (“turn right at the next
light and then go straight,” “Place tab A into slot B”), this is only its most mundane function.
Language also allows us to access existing knowledge, to draw conclusions, to set and
accomplish goals, and to understand and communicate complex social relationships. Language
is fundamental to our ability to think, and without it we would be nowhere near as intelligent as
we are.

Language can be conceptualized in terms of sounds, meaning, and the environmental factors
that help us understand it. Phonemes are the elementary sounds of our language, morphemes
are the smallest units of meaning in a language, syntax is the set of grammatical rules that
control how words are put together, and contextual information is the elements of
communication that are not part of the content of language but that help us understand its
meaning. Understanding how language works means reaching across many branches of
psychology—everything from basic neurological functioning to high-level cognitive processing.
Language shapes our social interactions and brings order to our lives. Complex language is one
of the defining factors that make us human.49

Introduction to Linguistics
Language is such a special topic that there is an entire field, linguistics, devoted to its study.
Linguistics views language in an objective way, using the scientific method and rigorous
research to form theories about how humans acquire, use, and sometimes abuse language.
There are a few major branches of linguistics, which it is useful to understand in order to learn
about language from a psychological perspective.

Major Branches of Linguistics
This diagram outlines the various subfields of linguistics, the study of language. These include
phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

Phonetics and Phonology
A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that makes a meaningful difference in a language. The
word “bit” has three phonemes, /b/, /i/, and /t/ (in transcription, phonemes are placed
between slashes), and the word “pit” also has three: /p/, /i/, and /t/. In spoken languages,
phonemes are produced by the positions and movements of the vocal tract, including our lips,
teeth, tongue, vocal cords, and throat, whereas in sign languages phonemes are defined by the
shapes and movement of the hands. English contains about 45 phonemes.
Whereas phonemes are the smallest units of sound in language, phonetics is the study of
individual speech sounds; phonology is the study of phonemes, which are the speech sounds of
an individual language. These two heavily overlapping subfields cover all the sounds that
humans can make, as well as which sounds make up different languages.

Morpheme and Morphology
A morpheme is a string of one or more phonemes that makes up the smallest units of meaning
in a language. Some morphemes, such as one-letter words like “I” and “a,” are also phonemes,
but most morphemes are made up of combinations of phonemes. Some morphemes are
prefixes and suffixes used to modify other words. For example, the syllable “re-” as in “rewrite”
or “repay” means “to do again,” and the suffix “-est” as in “happiest” or “coolest” means “to
the maximum.”
Morphology is the study of words and other meaningful units of language like suffixes and
prefixes. A morphologist would be interested in the relationship between words like “dog” and
“dogs” or “walk” and “walking,” and how people figure out the differences between those
words.

Syntax
Syntax is the set of rules of a language by which we construct sentences. Each language has a
different syntax. The syntax of the English language requires that each sentence have a noun
and a verb, each of which may be modified by adjectives and adverbs. Some syntaxes make use
of the order in which words appear, while others do not.
Syntax is the study of sentences and phrases, or how people put words into the right order so
that they can communicate meaningfully. All languages have underlying rules of syntax, which,
along with morphological rules, make up every language’s grammar. An example of syntax
coming into play in language is “Eugene walked the dog” versus “The dog walked Eugene.” The
order of words is not arbitrary—in order for the sentence to convey the intended meaning, the
words must be in a certain order.51

288 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Semantics and Pragmatics
Semantics, generally, is about the meaning of sentences. Someone who studies semantics is
interested in words and what real-world object or concept those words denote, or point to.
Pragmatics is an even broader field that studies how the context of a sentence contributes to
meaning. For example, someone shouting “Fire!” has a very different meaning if they are in
charge of a seven-gun salute than it does if they are sitting in a crowded movie theater. Every
language is different. In English, an adjective comes before a noun (“red house”), whereas in
Spanish, the adjective comes after (“casa [house] roja [red].”) In German, you can put noun
after noun together to form giant compound words; in Chinese, the pitch of your voice
determines the meaning of your words. in American Sign Language, you can convey full,
grammatical sentences with tense and aspect by moving your hands and face. But all languages
have structural underpinnings that make them logical for the people who speak and understand
them.52

Figure 11.28 – As speakers of Chinese, these boys would understand the importance of pitch.53

Cognitive Language and Communication
When learning one or more languages in middle childhood, children are able to understand that
there are many complex parts including comprehension, fluency, and meaning when
communicating. The following are areas of cognitive language and communication.

Lexicon
Every language has its rules, which act as a framework for meaningful communication. But what
do people fill that framework up with? The answer is, of course, words. Every human language
has a lexicon—the sum total of all of the words in that language. By using grammatical rules to
combine words into logical sentences, humans can convey an infinite number of concepts.

Grammar
Because all language obeys a set of combinatory rules, we can communicate an infinite number
of concepts. While every language has a different set of rules, all languages do obey rules.
These rules are known as grammar. Speakers of a language have internalized the rules and
52

53

289 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

exceptions for that language’s grammar. There are rules for every level of language—word
formation (for example, native speakers of English have internalized the general rule that -ed is
the ending for past-tense verbs, so even when they encounter a brand-new verb, they
automatically know how to put it into past tense); phrase formation (for example, knowing that
when you use the verb “buy,” it needs a subject and an object; “She buys” is wrong, but “She
buys a gift” is okay); and sentence formation.
Older children are also able to learn new rules of grammar with more flexibility. While younger
children are likely to be reluctant to give up saying "I goed there", older children will learn this
rather quickly along with other rules of grammar.

Vocabulary
One of the reasons that children can classify objects in so many ways is that they have acquired
a vocabulary to do so. By fifth grade, a child's vocabulary has grown to 40,000 words. It grows
at a rate that exceeds that of those in early childhood. This language explosion, however, differs
from that of younger children because it is facilitated by being able to associate new words with
those already known, and because it is accompanied by a more sophisticated understanding of
the meanings of a word.
Context
Words do not possess fixed meanings but change their interpretation as a function of the
context in which they are spoken. We use contextual information—the information
surrounding language—to help us interpret it. Context is how everything within language
works together to convey a particular meaning. Context includes tone of voice, body language,
and the words being used. Depending on how a person says something, holds his or her body,
or emphasizes certain points of a sentence, a variety of different messages can be conveyed.
For example, the word “awesome,” when said with a big smile, means the person is excited
about a situation. “Awesome,” said with crossed arms, rolled eyes, and a sarcastic tone, means
the person is not thrilled with the situation.54

Figure 11.29 – Context helps us understand meaning.55

New Understanding
Those in middle and late childhood are also able to think of objects in less literal ways. For
example, if asked for the first word that comes to mind when one hears the word "pizza", the
younger child is likely to say "eat" or some word that describes what is done with a pizza.
However, the older child is more likely to place pizza in the appropriate category and say
"food". This sophistication of vocabulary is also evidenced by the fact that older children tell
jokes and delight in doing so. They may use jokes that involve plays on words such as "knockknock" jokes or jokes with punch lines. Young children do not understand play on words and tell
"jokes" that are literal or slapstick, such as "A man fell down in the mud! Isn't that funny?" 56

Bilingualism - also known as Dual Language Learners or English Language
Learners
Although monolingual speakers (those that only speak one language) often do not realize it,
the majority of children around the world are bilingual, (they understand and use two
languages). (Meyers- Sutton, 2005). Even in the United States, which is a relatively monolingual
society, more than 47 million people speak a language other than English at home, and about
10 million of these people are children or youth in public schools (United States Department of
Commerce, 2003). The large majority of bilingual students (75%) are Hispanic, but the rest
represent more than a hundred different language groups from around the world. In larger
communities throughout the United States, it is therefore common for a single classroom to
contain students from several language backgrounds at once. In classrooms, as in other social
settings, bilingualism exists in different forms and degrees.

Figure 11.30 – The Iceberg Analogy.57

The student who speaks both languages fluently has a definite cognitive advantage. As you
might suspect and research confirmed, a fully fluent bilingual student is in a better position to

express concepts or ideas in more than one way, and to be aware of doing so (Jimenez, Garcia,
& Pearson, 1995; Francis, 2006). Having a large vocabulary in a first language has been shown
to save time in learning vocabulary in a second language (Hansen, Umeda & McKinney, 2002). 58

Theories of Language Development
Humans, especially children, have an amazing ability to learn language. Within the first year of
life, children will have learned many of the necessary concepts to have functional language,
although it will still take years for their capabilities to develop fully. As we just explained, some
people learn two or more languages fluently and are bilingual or multilingual. Here is a recap of
the theorists and theories that have been proposed to explain the development of language,
and related brain structures, in children.

Skinner: Operant Conditioning
B. F. Skinner believed that children learn language through operant conditioning; in other
words, children receive “rewards” for using language in a functional manner. For example, a
child learns to say the word “drink” when she is thirsty; she receives something to drink, which
reinforces her use of the word for getting a drink, and thus she will continue to do so. This
follows the four-term contingency that Skinner believed was the basis of language
development—motivating operations, discriminative stimuli, response, and reinforcing stimuli.
Skinner also suggested that children learn language through imitation of others, prompting,
and shaping.

Chomsky: Language Acquisition Device
Noam Chomsky’s work discusses the biological basis for language and claims that children have
innate abilities to learn language. Chomsky terms this innate ability the “language acquisition
device.” He believes children instinctively learn language without any formal instruction. He
also believes children have a natural need to use language, and that in the absence of formal
language children will develop a system of communication to meet their needs. He has
observed that all children make the same type of language errors, regardless of the language
they are taught. Chomsky also believes in the existence of a “universal grammar,” which posits
that there are certain grammatical rules all human languages share. However, his research does
not identify areas of the brain or a genetic basis that enables humans’ innate ability for
language.

Piaget: Assimilation and Accommodation
Jean Piaget’s theory of language development suggests that children use both assimilation and
accommodation to learn language. Assimilation is the process of changing one’s environment
to place information into an already-existing schema (or idea). Accommodation is the process
of changing one’s schema to adapt to the new environment. Piaget believed children need to
first develop mentally before language acquisition can occur. According to him, children first

create mental structures within the mind (schemas) and from these schemas, language
development happens.

Vygotsky: Zone of Proximal Development
Lev Vygotsky’s theory of language development focused on social learning and the zone of
proximal development (ZPD). The ZPD is a level of development obtained when children
engage in social interactions with others; it is the distance between a child’s potential to learn
and the actual learning that takes place. Vygotsky’s theory also demonstrated that Piaget
underestimated the importance of social interactions in the development of language.
Piaget’s and Vygotsky’s theories are often compared with each other, and both have been used
successfully in the field of education.

Figure 11.31 – This park ranger is using the ZPD to increase these boys understanding. 59

Learning to Read
A huge milestone in middle childhood is learning to read and write. While the foundations of
this were laid in infancy and early childhood, formal instruction on this process usually happens
during the school-age years. There isn’t always complete agreement on how children are best
taught to read. The following approaches to teaching reading are separated by their
methodology, but today, models of reading strive for a balance between the two types of
reading methods because they are both recognized as essential for learning to read.
 A phonics-based approach teaches reading by making sure children can understand
letter-sound correspondences (how letters sound), automatically recognize familiar
words, and decode unfamiliar words. This ability to break the code of reading allows
children to read words they have never heard spoken before.
 The whole-language approach attempts to teach reading as naturally as possible. As the
sounds of words don’t have meaning, the focus is on reading words and sentences in
59

context (such as real books), rather than learning the sounds and phonemes that make
up words.60

Learning Difficulties
When children don’t seem to be developing or learning in the typical pattern one might be
assessed for a disorder or disability. What is a learning disorder or disability? In the next
section we’ll learn about the spectrum of disorders and how they may impact many areas of
the child's life.
 A learning disorder is a classification of disorders in which a person has difficulty
learning in a typical manner within one of several domains. Types of learning disorders
include difficulties in reading (dyslexia), mathematics (dyscalculia), and writing
(dysgraphia). These disorders are diagnosed with certain criteria.
 A learning disability has problems in a specific area or with a specific task or type of
activity related to education.
Children with learning challenges are usually identified in school because this is when their
academic abilities are being tested, compared, and measured. In the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders -DSM-5, a qualified person will make a diagnosis, identified causes,
and will make a treatment plan for disorders and disabilities. The diagnosis of specific learning
disorder was added to the DSM-5 in 2013.
The DSM does not require that a single domain of difficulty (such as reading, mathematics, or
written expression) be identified—instead, it is a single diagnosis that describes a collection of
potential difficulties with general academic skills, simply including detailed specifies for the
areas of reading, mathematics, and writing. Academic performance must be below average in
at least one of these fields, and the symptoms may also interfere with daily life or work. In
addition, the learning difficulties cannot be attributed to other sensory, motor, developmental,
or neurological disorders.61
The following is an example of the DSM-5 - learning disorders.

Learning Disorders or Disabilities
Dyslexia
Dyslexia, sometimes called “reading disorder,” is the most common learning disability; of all
students with specific learning disabilities, 70%–80% have deficits in reading. The term
"developmental dyslexia" is often used as a catchall term, but researchers assert that dyslexia is
just one of several types of reading disabilities. A reading disability can affect any part of the
reading process, including word recognition, word decoding, reading speed, prosody (oral
reading with expression), and reading comprehension.

Dyscalculia
Dyscalculia is a form of math-related disability that involves difficulties with learning mathrelated concepts (such as quantity, place value, and time), memorizing math-related facts,
organizing numbers, and understanding how problems are organized on the page. Dyscalculics
are often referred to as having poor "number sense."

Dyspraxia
Children who have motor skills substantially below what is expected for their age are diagnosed
with dyspraxia – or developmental coordination disorder (DCD) as it is more formally known.
They are not lazy, clumsy or unintelligent – in fact, their intellectual ability is in line with the
general population – but they do struggle with everyday tasks that require coordination.

abilities are being tested, compared, and measured. 63

Dysgraphia
The term dysgraphia is often used as an overarching term for all disorders of written
expression. Individuals with dysgraphia typically show multiple writing-related deficiencies,
such as grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization,
multiple spelling errors, and excessively poor penmanship.64

Auditory Processing Disorder
A processing deficit in the auditory modality that spans multiple processes is auditory
processing disorder (APD). To date, APD diagnosis is mostly based on the utilization of speech
material. Unfortunately, acceptable non-speech tests that allow differentiation between an
actual central hearing disorder and related disorders such as specific language impairments are
still not adequately available.

Visual Processing Disorder
Difficulty processing or interpreting visual information is referred to as visual processing
disorder (VPD). Kids with visual processing issues may have difficulty telling the difference
between two shapes or finding a specific piece of information on a page. 65

Speech and Language Disorders
Aphasia
A loss of the ability to produce or understand language is referred to as aphasia. Without the
brain, there would be no language. The human brain has a few areas that are specific to
language processing and production. When these areas are damaged or injured, capabilities for
speaking or understanding can be lost, a disorder known as aphasia. These areas must function
together in order for a person to develop, use, and understand language.

Articulation disorder
An articulation disorder refers to the inability to correctly produce speech sounds (phonemes)
because of imprecise placement, timing, pressure, speed, or flow of movement of the lips,
tongue, or throat (NIDCD, 2016). Sounds can be substituted, left off, added or changed. These
errors may make it hard for people to understand the speaker. They can range from problems
with specific sounds, such as lisping to severe impairment in the phonological system. Most
children have problems pronouncing words early on while their speech is developing. However,
by age three, at least half of what a child says should be understood by a stranger. By age five, a
child's speech should be mostly intelligible. Parents should seek help if by age six the child is still
having trouble producing certain sounds. It should be noted that accents are not articulation
disorders (Medline Plus, 2016a).

Fluency disorders
Fluency disorders affect the rate of speech. Speech may be labored and slow, or too fast for
listeners to follow. The most common fluency disorder is stuttering.
Stuttering is a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables, or words are repeated or last longer
than normal. These problems cause a break in the flow of speech, which is called dysfluency
(Medline Plus, 2016b). About 5% of young children, aged two-five, will develop some stuttering
that may last from several weeks to several years (Medline Plus, 2016c). Approximately 75% of
children recover from stuttering. For the remaining 25%, stuttering can persist as a lifelong
communication disorder (National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders,
NIDCD, 2016). This is called developmental stuttering and is the most common form of
stuttering.
Brain injury, and in very rare instances, emotional trauma may be other triggers for developing
problems with stuttering. In most cases of developmental stuttering, other family members
share the same communication disorder. Researchers have recently identified variants in four
genes that are more commonly found in those who stutter (NIDCD, 2016).

Voice disorders
Disorders of the voice involve problems with pitch, loudness, and quality of the voice
(American Speech-Language and Hearing Association, 2016). It only becomes a disorder when
problems with the voice make the child unintelligible. In children, voice disorders are
significantly more prevalent in males than in females. Between 1.4% and 6% of children
297 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

experience problems with the quality of their voice. Causes can be due to structural
abnormalities in the vocal cords and/or larynx, functional factors, such as vocal fatigue from
overuse, and in rarer cases psychological factors, such as chronic stress and anxiety.67

Figure 11.33 – Speech therapy.68

Children with Disabilities: Legislation
Since the 1970s political and social attitudes have moved increasingly toward including people
with disabilities into a wide variety of “regular” activities. In the United States, the shift is
illustrated clearly in the Federal legislation that was enacted during this time. Three major laws
were passed that guaranteed the rights of persons with disabilities, and of children and
students with disabilities in particular. The third law has had the biggest impact on education.

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504
This law, the first of its kind, required that individuals with disabilities be accommodated in any
program or activity that receives Federal funding (PL93-112, 1973). Although this law was not
intended specifically for education, in practice it has protected students' rights in some extracurricular activities (for older students) and in some childcare or after-school care programs (for
younger students). If those programs receive Federal funding of any kind, the programs are not
allowed to exclude children or youths with disabilities, and they have to find reasonable ways
to accommodate the individuals' disabilities.

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (or ADA)
This legislation also prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability, just as Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act had done (PL 101-336, 1990). Although the ADA also applies to all people
(not just to students), its provisions are more specific and “stronger” than those of Section 504.
In particular, ADA extends to all employment and jobs, not just those receiving Federal funding.

It also specifically requires accommodations to be made in public facilities such as with buses,
restrooms, and telephones. ADA legislation is therefore responsible for some of the “minor”
renovations in schools that you may have noticed in recent years, like wheelchair-accessible
doors, ramps, and restrooms, and public telephones with volume controls.

Figure 11.34 - President George H. W. Bush Signs the Americans with Disabilities Act, 07/26/1990.69

Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (or IDEA)
As its name implied this legislation was more focused on education than either Section 504 or
ADA. It was first passed in 1975 and has been amended several times since, including most
recently in 2004 (PL 108-446, 2004). In its current form, the law guarantees the following rights
related to education for anyone with a disability from birth to age 21.
The first two rights influence schooling in general, but the last three affect the work of
classroom teachers rather directly:
 Free, appropriate education: An individual or an individual's family should not have to
pay for education simply because the individual has a disability, and the educational
program should be truly educational; i.e., not merely caretaking or babysitting.
 Due process: In case of disagreements between an individual with a disability and the
schools or other professionals, there must be procedures for resolving the
disagreements that are fair and accessible to all parties, including the person himself or
herself or the person's representative.
 Fair evaluation of performance in spite of disability: Tests or other evaluations should
not assume test taking skills that a person with a disability cannot reasonably be
expected to have, such as holding a pencil, hearing or seeing questions, working quickly,
or understanding and speaking orally. Evaluation procedures should be modified to
allow for these differences. This provision of the law applies both to evaluations made
by teachers and to school-wide or “high-stakes” testing programs.
 Education in the “least restrictive environment”: Education for someone with a
disability should provide as many educational opportunities and options for the person



as possible, both in the short term and in the long term. In practice, this requirement
has meant including students in regular classrooms and school activities as much as
possible.
An Individualized Educational Plan (IEP): Given that every disability is unique,
instructional planning for a person with a disability should be unique or individualized as
well. In practice, this provision has led to classroom teachers planning individualized
programs jointly with other professionals (like reading specialists, psychologists, or
medical personnel) as part of a team.70

Emotional Development
Chapter Objectives
After this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Describe the social emotional theories of development
2. Examine the importance of positive friendships and peer relationships
3. Describe self-understanding in childhood
4. Identify the types of families children are part of
5. Explain aggression, antisocial behavior, and bullying

Introduction
As children get older, their experiences allow them to develop a more realistic understanding of
themselves, including both their strengths and weaknesses. This developing self-concept is
influenced by messages they receive from their peers, their family, and the media.

Social Emotional Theories of Development
Erik Erikson- Industry vs. Inferiority
Erik Erikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in certain areas
of our lives. As we’ve learned in previous chapters, Erikson’s psychosocial theory has eight
stages of development over the lifespan, from infancy through late adulthood. At each stage
there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve. Successful completion of each
developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality. Failure to
master these tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.
During the elementary school stage (ages 6-12), children face the task of Industry versus
Inferiority. Children begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up.

Figure 12.1 – The academic award this boy is receiving may contribute to his sense of industry.1

They either develop a sense of pride and accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social
activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and inadequate when they don’t measure up.2
According to Erikson, children in middle childhood are very busy or industrious. They are
constantly doing, planning, playing, getting together with friends, achieving. This is a very active
time and a time when they are gaining a sense of how they measure up when compared with
friends. Erikson believed that if these industrious children can be successful in their endeavors,
they will get a sense of confidence for future challenges. If not, a sense of inferiority can be
particularly haunting during middle childhood.3

Sigmund Freud - Psychoanalytic Theory
The great psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) focused on unconscious, biological forces
that he felt shape individual personality. Freud (1933) thought that the personality consists of
three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. The id is the selfish part of the personality and
consists of biological instincts that all babies have, including the need for food and, more
generally, the demand for immediate gratification. As babies get older, they learn that not all
their needs can be immediately satisfied and thus develop the ego, or the rational part of the
personality. As children get older still, they internalize society’s norms and values and thus
begin to develop their superego, which represents society’s conscience. If a child does not
develop normally and the superego does not become strong enough, the individual is more at
risk for being driven by the id to commit antisocial behavior.4

Figure 12.2 – Development of the superego helps children overcome their unconscious desire to behave
antisocially.5

Lawrence Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development
Kohlberg (1963) built on the work of Piaget and was interested in finding out how our moral
reasoning changes as we get older. He wanted to find out how people decide what is right and
what is wrong. Just as Piaget believed that children’s cognitive development follows specific

patterns, Kohlberg (1984) argued that we learn our moral values through active thinking and
reasoning, and that moral development follows a series of stages. Kohlberg's six stages are
generally organized into three levels of moral reasons. To study moral development, Kohlberg
looked at how children (and adults) respond to moral dilemmas. One of Kohlberg’s best known
moral dilemmas is the Heinz dilemma:
In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug
that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the
same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make but the druggist
was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make. He paid $200 for the radium
and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman’s husband, Heinz,
went to everyone he knew to borrow the money but he could only get together about
$1,000, about half of what the drug cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying
and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I
discovered the drug and I’m going to make money from it.” Heinz got desperate and
broke into the man’s store to steal the drug for his wife. Should the husband have done
that? (Kohlberg, 1969, p. 379)6

Level One - Preconventional Morality
In stage one, moral reasoning is based on concepts of punishment. The child believes that if the
consequence for an action is punishment, then the action was wrong. In the second stage, the
child bases his or her thinking on self-interest and reward ("You scratch my back, I'll scratch
yours"). The youngest subjects seemed to answer based on what would happen to the man as a
result of the act. For example, they might say the man should not break into the pharmacy
because the pharmacist might find him and beat him. Or they might say that the man should
break in and steal the drug and his wife will give him a big kiss. Right or wrong, both decisions
were based on what would physically happen to the man as a result of the act. This is a selfcentered approach to moral decision-making. He called this most superficial understanding of
right and wrong preconventional morality. Preconventional morality focuses on self-interest.
Punishment is avoided and rewards are sought. Adults can also fall into these stages,
particularly when they are under pressure.

Level Two - Conventional Morality
Those tested who based their answers on what other people would think of the man as a result
of his act, were placed in Level Two. For instance, they might say he should break into the store,
then everyone would think he was a good husband, or he should not because it is against the
law. In either case, right and wrong is determined by what other people think. In stage three,
the person wants to please others. At stage four, the person acknowledges the importance of
social norms or laws and wants to be a good member of the group or society. A good decision is
one that gains the approval of others or one that complies with the law. This he called
conventional morality, people care about the effect of their actions on others. Some older
children, adolescents, and adults use this reasoning.

Level Three, post conventional morality, is not included because it focuses on adolescence and
adulthood. However, it is in the table below if you’d like an overview of Level Three - Stages 5
and 6.

Stage 1

Focus is on self-interest and punishment is avoided. The man shouldn’t

steal the drug because he does not want to lose his wife who takes care of
him.

Stage 6

Conventional Morality (older children, adolescents, most adults)
Description
Focus is on how situational outcomes impact others and wanting to
please and be accepted. The man should steal the drug because that is
what good husbands do.
People make decisions based on laws or formalized rules. The man should
obey the law because stealing is a crime.
Post Conventional Morality (rare in adolescents, a few adults)
Description
Individuals employ abstract reasoning to justify behaviors. The man
should steal the drug because laws can be unjust and you have to
consider the whole situation.
Moral behavior is based on self-chosen ethical principles. The man should
steal the drug because life is more important than property.

Although research has supported Kohlberg’s idea that moral reasoning changes from an early
emphasis on punishment and social rules and regulations to an emphasis on more general
ethical principles, as with Piaget’s approach, Kohlberg’s stage model is probably too simple. For
one, people may use higher levels of reasoning for some types of problems but revert to lower
levels in situations where doing so is more consistent with their goals or beliefs (Rest, 1979).
Second, it has been argued that the stage model is particularly appropriate for Western, rather
than non-Western, samples in which allegiance to social norms, such as respect for authority,
may be particularly important (Haidt, 2001). In addition, there is frequently little correlation
between how we score on the moral stages and how we behave in real life. Perhaps the most

305 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

important critique of Kohlberg’s theory is that it may describe the moral development of males
better than it describes that of females (Jaffee & Hyde, 2000).7

Self-Understanding
Children in middle childhood have a more realistic sense of self than do those in early
childhood. That exaggerated sense of self as “biggest” or “smartest” or “tallest” gives way to an
understanding of one’s strengths and weaknesses. This can be attributed to greater experience
in comparing one’s own performance with that of others and to greater cognitive flexibility. A
child’s self-concept can be influenced by peers and family and the messages they send about a
child’s worth. Contemporary children also receive messages from the media about how they
should look and act. Movies, music videos, the internet, and advertisers can all create cultural
images of what is desirable or undesirable and this too can influence a child’s self-concept.

Figure 12.3 – Interactions with the media children’s perception of themselves.8

Remarkably, young children begin developing social understanding very early in life and are also
able to include other peoples’ appraisals of them into their self-concept, including parents,
teachers, peers, culture, and media. Internalizing others’ appraisals and creating social
comparison affect children’s self-esteem, which is defined as an evaluation of one’s identity.
Children can have individual assessments of how well they perform a variety of activities and
also develop an overall, global self-assessment. If there is a discrepancy between how children
view themselves and what they consider to be their ideal selves, their self-esteem can be
negatively affected.9
Self-concept refers to beliefs about general personal identity (Seiffert, 2011). These beliefs
include personal attributes, such as one’s age, physical characteristics, behaviors, and
competencies. Children in middle and late childhood have a more realistic sense of self than do
those in early childhood, and they better understand their strengths and weaknesses. This can

be attributed to greater experience in comparing their own performance with that of others,
and to greater cognitive flexibility. Children in middle and late childhood are also able to include
other peoples’ appraisals of them into their self-concept, including parents, teachers, peers,
culture, and media.
Another important development in self-understanding is self-efficacy, which is the belief that
you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal (Bandura, 1977,
1986, 1997). Large discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability can create motivational
problems for the individual (Seifert, 2011). If a student believes that he or she can solve
mathematical problems, then the student is more likely to attempt the mathematics homework
that the teacher assigns.
Unfortunately, the converse is also true. If a student believes that he or she is incapable of
math, then the student is less likely to attempt the math homework regardless of the student's
actual ability in math. Since self-efficacy is self-constructed, it is possible for students to
miscalculate or misperceive their true skill, and these misperceptions can have complex effects
on students' motivations. It is possible to have either too much or too little self-efficacy, and
according to Bandura (1997) the optimal level seems to be either at, or slightly above, true
ability.10

Figure 12.4 – Families can support children’s social and emotional skills.11

As we have seen, children’s experience of relationships at home and the peer group contributes
to an expanding repertoire of social and emotional skills and also to broadened social
understanding. In these relationships, children develop expectations for specific people
(leading, for example, to secure or insecure attachments to parents), understanding of how to
interact with adults and peers, and self-concept based on how others respond to them. These
relationships are also significant forums for emotional development.12

Motivation as Self-Efficacy
In addition to being influenced by their goals, interests, and attributions, students’ motives are
affected by specific beliefs about the student’s personal capacities. In self-efficacy theory the
beliefs become a primary, explicit explanation for motivation (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). Selfefficacy is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific
goal. As mentioned previously, the optimal level seems to be either at or slightly above true
capacity (Bandura, 1997). As we indicate below, large discrepancies between self-efficacy and
ability can create motivational problems for the individual.13

Motivation
Motivation refers to a desire, need, or drive that contributes to and explains behavioral
changes. In general, motivators provide some sort of incentive for completing a task. One
definition of a motivator explains it as a force “acting either on or within a person to initiate
behavior.” In addition to biological motives, motivations can be either intrinsic (arising from
internal factors) or extrinsic (arising from external factors).

Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Motivation
Intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction
that they bring. According to Deci (1971), these behaviors are defined as ones for which the
reward is the satisfaction of performing the activity itself. Intrinsic motivation thus represents
engagement in an activity for its own sake. For example, if comforting a friend makes a child
feel good, they are intrinsically motivated to respond to their friend’s distress.
Extrinsically motivated behaviors, on the other hand, are performed in order to receive
something from others or avoid certain negative outcomes. The extrinsic motivator is outside
of, and acts on, the individual. Rewards—such as a sticker, or candy—are good examples of
extrinsic motivators. Social and emotional incentives like praise and attention are also extrinsic
motivators since they are bestowed on the individual by another person.

Figure 12.5 – A lollipop can be an extrinsic motivator.14

Learned Helplessness and Self-Efficacy
If a person’s sense of self-efficacy is very low, he or she can develop learned helplessness, a
perception of complete lack of control in mastering a task. The attitude is similar to depression,
a pervasive feeling of apathy and a belief that effort makes no difference and does not lead to
success. Learned helplessness was originally studied from the behaviorist perspective of
classical and operant conditioning by the psychologist Martin Seligman (1995). In people,
learned helplessness leads to characteristic ways of dealing with problems. They tend to
attribute the source of a problem to themselves, to generalize the problem to many aspects of
life, and to see the problem as lasting or permanent. More optimistic individuals, in contrast,
are more likely to attribute a problem to outside sources, to see it as specific to a particular
situation or activity, and to see it as temporary or time-limited. Consider, for example, two
students who each fail a test. The one with a lot of learned helplessness is more likely to explain
the failure by saying something like: “I’m stupid; I never perform well on any schoolwork, and I
never will perform well at it.” The other, more optimistic student is more likely to say
something like: “The teacher made the test too hard this time, so the test doesn’t prove
anything about how I will do next time or in other subjects.”

Figure 12.6 – If this girl thinks that studying won’t help her do well on the
test, her low self-efficacy may develop into learned helplessness.15

What is noteworthy about these differences in perception is how much the more optimistic of
these perspectives resembles high self-efficacy and how much learned helplessness seems to
contradict or differ from it. As already noted, high self-efficacy is a strong belief in one’s
capacity to carry out a specific task successfully. By definition, therefore, self-efficacy focuses
attention on a temporary or time-limited activity (the task), even though the cause of successful
completion (oneself) is “internal.”16

Gender Identity
The development of gender and gender identity is likewise an interaction among social,
biological, and representational influences (Ruble, Martin, & Berenbaum, 2006). Young children
learn about gender from parents, peers, and others in society, and develop their own
conceptions of the attributes associated with maleness or femaleness (called gender schemas).
They also negotiate biological transitions (such as puberty) that cause their sense of themselves
and their sexual identity to mature.

Figure 12.7 - Social influences such as cultural norms impact children's interests, dress, style of speech and even
life aspirations.17

Each of these examples of the growth of social and emotional competence illustrates not only
the interaction of social, biological, and representational influences, but also how their
development unfolds over an extended period. Early influences are important, but not
determinative, because the capabilities required for mature moral conduct, gender identity,
and other outcomes continue to develop throughout childhood, adolescence, and even the
adult years.
As the preceding sentence suggests, social and personality development continues through
adolescence and the adult years, and it is influenced by the same constellation of social,
biological, and representational influences discussed for childhood. Changing social
relationships and roles, biological maturation and (much later) decline, and how the individual
represents both experience and the self continue to form the bases for development
throughout life. In this respect, when an adult looks forward rather than retrospectively to ask,
“What kind of person am I becoming?”—A similarly fascinating, complex, multifaceted
interaction of developmental processes lies ahead.18

Child and the Family
The reason we turn out much like our parents, for better or worse, is that our families are such
an important part of our socialization process. When we are born, our primary caregivers are
almost always one or both of our parents. For several years we have more contact with them
than with any other adults. Because this contact occurs in our most formative years, our
parents’ interaction with us and the messages they teach us can have a profound impact
throughout our lives. During middle childhood, children spend less time with parents and more
time with peers. Parents may have to modify their approach to parenting to accommodate the
child’s growing independence. Using reason and engaging in joint decision-making whenever
possible may be the most effective approach (Berk, 2007).19

One of the ways to assess the quality of family life is to consider the tasks of families. Berger
(2005) lists five family functions:
1. Providing food, clothing and shelter
2. Encouraging learning
3. Developing self-esteem
4. Nurturing friendships with peers
5. Providing harmony and stability
Notice that in addition to providing food, shelter, and clothing, families are responsible for
helping the child learn, relate to others, and have a confident sense of self. The family provides
a harmonious and stable environment for living. A good home environment is one in which the
child’s physical, cognitive, emotional, and social needs are adequately met. Sometimes families
emphasize physical needs but ignore cognitive or emotional needs. Other times, families pay
close attention to physical needs and academic requirement, but may fail to nurture the child’s

friendships with peers or guide the child toward developing healthy relationships. Parents
might want to consider how it feels to live in the household. Is it stressful and conflict-ridden? Is
it a place where family members enjoy being?21

Figure 12.8 – This mother is helping her son navigate using a tablet.22

The Family Stress Model
Family relationships are significantly affected by conditions outside the home. For instance, the
Family Stress Model describes how financial difficulties are associated with parents’ depressed
moods, which in turn lead to marital problems and poor parenting that contributes to poorer
child adjustment (Conger, Conger, & Martin, 2010). Within the home, parental marital difficulty
or divorce affects more than half the children growing up today in the United States. Divorce is
typically associated with economic stresses for children and parents, the renegotiation of
parent-child relationships (with one parent typically as primary custodian and the other
assuming a visiting relationship), and many other significant adjustments for children. Divorce is
often regarded by children as a sad turning point in their lives, although for most it is not
associated with long-term problems of adjustment (Emery, 1999).

Family Forms
As discussed previously in chapter 9, the sociology of the family examines the family as an
institution and a unit of socialization. Sociological studies of the family look at demographic
characteristics of the family members: family size, age, ethnicity and gender of its members,
social class of the family, the economic level and mobility of the family, professions of its
members, and the education levels of the family members.
Currently, one of the biggest issues that sociologists study are the changing roles of family
members. Often, each member is restricted by the gender roles of the traditional family. These
roles, such as the father as the breadwinner and the mother as the homemaker, are declining.
Now, the mother is often the supplementary provider while retaining the responsibilities of
child rearing. In this scenario, females' role in the labor force is "compatible with the demands

of the traditional family.” Sociology studies have examined the adaptation of males' role to
caregiver as well as provider. The gender roles are becoming increasingly interwoven and
various other family forms are becoming more common.

Throughout this textbook and in the preceding images, you can see a variety of types of
families. A few of these family types (the ones that are not bolded) were introduced in Chapter
9. Here is a list of some of the diverse types of families:

Families Without Children
Singlehood family contains a person who is not married or in a common law relationship. He or
she may share a relationship with a partner but lead a single lifestyle.
Couples that are childless are often overlooked in the discussion of families.

Families with One Parent
A single parent family usually refers to a parent who has most of the day-to-day responsibilities
in the raising of the child or children, who are not living with a spouse or partner, or who is not
married. The dominant caregiver is the parent with whom the children reside for the majority
of the time; if the parents are separated or divorced, children live with their custodial parent
and have visitation with their noncustodial parent. In western society in general, following a
separation a child will end up with the primary caregiver, usually the mother, and a secondary
caregiver, usually the father.
Single parent by choice families refer to a family that a single person builds by choice. These
families can be built with the use of assisted reproductive technology and donor gametes
(sperm and/or egg) or embryos, surrogacy, foster or kinship care, and adoption.

Two Parent Families
The nuclear family is often referred to as the traditional family structure. It includes two
married parents and children. While common in industrialized cultures (such as the U.S.), it is
not actually the most common type of family worldwide.29
Cohabitation is an arrangement where two people who are not married live together in an
intimate relationship, particularly an emotionally and/or sexually intimate one, on a long-term
or permanent basis. Today, cohabitation is a common pattern among people in the Western
world. More than two-thirds of married couples in the U.S. say that they lived together before
getting married.
Gay and lesbian couples with children have same-sex families. While now recognized legally in
the United States, discrimination against same-sex families is not uncommon. According to the
American Academy of Pediatrics, there is “ample evidence to show that children raised by
same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years
of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation
and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment.
Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or

homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can
further strengthen these families.”30
Blended families describe families with mixed parents: one or both parents remarried, bringing
children of the former family into the new family31. Blended families are complex in a number
of ways that can pose unique challenges to those who seek to form successful stepfamily
relationships (Visher & Visher, 1985). These families are also referred to as stepfamilies.

Families That Include Additional Adults
Extended families include three generations, grandparents, parents, and children. This is the
most common type of family worldwide.32
Families by choice are relatively newly recognized. Popularized by the LGBTQ community to
describe a family not recognized by the legal system. It may include adopted children, live-in
partners, kin of each member of the household, and close friends. Increasingly family by choice
is being practiced by those who see benefit to including people beyond blood relatives in their
families.33
While most families in the U.S. are monogamous, some families have more than two married
parents. These families are polygamous.34 Polygamy is illegal in all 50 states, but it is legal in
other parts of the world.35

Additional Forms of Families
Kinship families are those in which the full-time care, nurturing, and protection of a child is
provided by relatives, members of their Tribe or clan, godparents, stepparents, or other adults
who have a family relationship to a child. When children cannot be cared for by their parents,
research finds benefits to kinship care.36
When a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological
or legal parent or parents this creates adoptive families. Legal adoption permanently transfers
all rights and responsibilities and is intended to affect a permanent change in status and as such
requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. As introduced in
Chapter 3, adoption can be done privately, through an agency, or through foster care and in the
U.S. or from abroad. Adoptions can be closed (no contact with birth/biological families or open,
with different degrees of contact with birth/biological families). Couples, both opposite and

same-sex, and single parents can adopt (although not all agencies and foreign countries will
work with unmarried, single, or same-sex intended parents).37
When parents are not of the same ethnicity, they build interracial families. Until the decision in
Loving v Virginia in 1969, this was not legal in the U.S. There are other parts of the world where
marrying someone outside of your race (or social class) has legal and social ramifications.38
These families may experience issues unique to each individual family’s culture.

Changes in Families - Divorce
The tasks of families listed above are functions that can be fulfilled in a variety of family types—
not just intact, two-parent households. Harmony and stability can be achieved in many family
forms and when it is disrupted, either through divorce, or efforts to blend families, or any other
circumstances, the child suffers (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002). Changes continue to happen, but
for children they are especially vulnerable. Divorce and how it impacts children depends on
how the caregivers handle the divorce as well as how they support the emotional needs of the
child.

Figure 12.15 – How divorce impacts children largely depends on how parents handle it. 39

Divorce
A lot of attention has been given to the impact of divorce on the life of
children. The assumption has been that divorce has a strong, negative impact on the child and
that single-parent families are deficient in some way. However, 75-80 percent of children and
adults who experience divorce suffer no long-term effects (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002). An
objective view of divorce, repartnering, and remarriage indicates that divorce, remarriage and
life in stepfamilies can have a variety of effects.40

Factors Affecting the Impact of Divorce
As you look at the consequences (both pro and con) of divorce and remarriage on children,
keep these family functions in mind. Some negative consequences are a result of financial
hardship rather than divorce per se (Drexler, 2005). Some positive consequences reflect
improvements in meeting these functions. For instance, we have learned that a positive selfesteem comes in part from a belief in the self and one’s abilities rather than merely being
complimented by others. In single-parent homes, children may be given more opportunity to
discover their own abilities and gain independence that fosters self-esteem. If divorce leads to
fighting between the parents and the child is included in these arguments, their self-esteem
may suffer.
The impact of divorce on children depends on a number of factors. The degree of conflict prior
to the divorce plays a role. If the divorce means a reduction in tensions, the child may feel
relief. If the parents have kept their conflicts hidden, the announcement of a divorce can come
as a shock and be met with enormous resentment. Another factor that has a great impact on
the child concerns financial hardships they may suffer, especially if financial support is
inadequate. Another difficult situation for children of divorce is the position they are put into if
the parents continue to argue and fight—especially if they bring the children into those
arguments.
Short-term consequences: In roughly the first year following divorce, children may exhibit
some of these short-term effects:
1. Grief over losses suffered. The child will grieve the loss of the parent they no longer see
as frequently. The child may also grieve about other family members that are no longer
available. Grief sometimes comes in the form of sadness but it can also be experienced
as anger or withdrawal. Older children may feel depressed.
2. Reduced Standard of Living. Very often, divorce means a change in the amount of
money coming into the household. Children experience new constraints on spending or
entertainment. School-aged children, especially, may notice that they can no longer
have toys, clothing or other items to which they’ve grown accustomed. Or it may mean
that there is less eating out or being able to afford cable television, and so on. The
custodial parent may experience stress at not being able to rely on child support
payments or having the same level of income as before. This can affect decisions
regarding healthcare, vacations, rents, mortgages and other expenditures. And the
stress can result in less happiness and relaxation in the home. The parent who has to
take on more work may also be less available to the children.
3. Adjusting to Transitions. Children may also have to adjust to other changes
accompanying a divorce. The divorce might mean moving to a new home and changing
schools or friends. It might mean leaving a neighborhood that has meant a lot to them
as well.
Long-Term consequences: Here are some effects that go beyond just the first year following
divorce.

317 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

1. Economic/Occupational Status. One of the most commonly cited long-term effects of
divorce is that children of divorce may have lower levels of education or occupational
status. This may be a consequence of lower income and resources for funding
education rather than to divorce per se. In those households where economic hardship
does not occur, there may be no impact on economic status (Drexler, 2005).
2. Improved Relationships with the Custodial Parent (usually the mother): Most children
of divorce lead happy, well-adjusted lives and develop stronger, positive relationships
with their custodial parent (Seccombe and Warner, 2004). Others have also found that
relationships between mothers and children become closer and stronger (Guttman,
1993) and suggest that greater equality and less rigid parenting is beneficial after
divorce (Steward, Copeland, Chester, Malley, and Barenbaum, 1997).
3. Greater emotional independence in sons. Drexler (2005) notes that sons who are raised
by mothers only develop an emotional sensitivity to others that is beneficial in
relationships.
4. Feeling more anxious in their own love relationships. Children of divorce may feel
more anxious about their own relationships as adults. This may reflect a fear of divorce
if things go wrong, or it may be a result of setting higher expectations for their own
relationships.
5. Adjustment of the custodial parent. Furstenberg and Cherlin (1991) believe that the
primary factor influencing the way that children adjust to divorce is the way the
custodial parent adjusts to the divorce. If that parent is adjusting well, the children will
benefit. This may explain a good deal of the variation we find in children of divorce.41

balance between taking care of the Air Force mission and taking care of her children. 42

Families are the most important part of the 6 to 11-year-old life. However, peers and
friendships become more and more important to the child in middle childhood.

Friendships, Peers, and Peer groups
Parent-child relationships are not the only significant relationships in a child’s life. Friendships
take on new importance as judges of one’s worth, competence, and attractiveness. Friendships
provide the opportunity for learning social skills such as how to communicate with others and
how to negotiate differences. Children get ideas from one another about how to perform
certain tasks, how to gain popularity, what to wear, say, and listen to, and how to
act. This society of children marks a transition from a life focused on the family to a life
concerned with peers. Peers play a key role in a child’s self-esteem at this age as any parent
who has tried to console a rejected child will tell you. No matter how complimentary and
encouraging the parent may be, being rejected by friends can only be remedied by renewed
acceptance.43

Figure 12.17 – Peers influence a child’s self-esteem.44

Children’s conceptualization of what makes someone a “friend” changes from a more
egocentric understanding to one based on mutual trust and commitment. Both Bigelow (1977)
and Selman (1980) believe that these changes are linked to advances in cognitive development.
Bigelow and La Gaipa (1975) outline three stages to children’s conceptualization of friendship45.

Table 12.2 - Three Stages to Children’s Conceptualization of Friendship46
Stage
Stage One

Stage Two

Stage Three

Descriptions
In stage one, reward-cost, friendship focuses on mutual activities. Children in
early, middle, and late childhood all emphasize similar interests as the main
characteristics of a good friend.
In stage two, normative expectation, focuses on conventional morality; that
is, the emphasis is on a friend as someone who is kind and shares with you.
Clark and Bittle (1992) found that fifth graders emphasized this in a friend
more than third or eighth graders.
In stage three, empathy and understanding, friends are people who are
loyal, committed to the relationship, and share intimate information. Clark
and Bittle (1992) reported eighth graders emphasized this more in a friend.
They also found that as early as fifth grade, girls were starting to include the
sharing of secrets and not betraying confidences as crucial to someone who is
a friend.

Friendships are very important for children. The social interaction with another child who is
similar in age, skills, and knowledge provokes the development of many social skills that are
valuable for the rest of life (Bukowski, Buhrmester, & Underwood, 2011). In these
relationships, children learn how to initiate and maintain social interactions with other children.
They learn skills for managing conflict, such as turn-taking, compromise, and bargaining. Play
also involves the mutual, sometimes complex, coordination of goals, actions, and
understanding. Through these experiences, children develop friendships that provide additional
sources of security and support to those provided by their parents.47

Five Stages of Friendship from Early Childhood through Adulthood48
Selman (1980) outlines five stages of friendship from early childhood through to adulthood.
 In stage 0, momentary physical interaction, a friend is someone who you are playing
with at this point in time. Selman notes that this is typical of children between the
ages of three and six. These early friendships are based more on circumstances (e.g., a
neighbor) than on genuine similarities.
 In stage 1, one-way assistance, a friend is someone who does nice things for you, such
as saving you a seat on the school bus or sharing a toy. However, children in this
stage, do not always think about what they are contributing to the relationships.

Five Stages of Friendship from Early Childhood through Adulthood48

Nonetheless, having a friend is important and children will sometimes put up with a
not so nice friend, just to have a friend. Children as young as five and as old as nine
may be in this stage.
In stage 2, fair-weather cooperation, children are very concerned with fairness and
reciprocity, and thus, a friend is someone who returns a favor. In this stage, if a child
does something nice for a friend there is an expectation that the friend will do
something nice for them at the first available opportunity. When this fails to happen,
a child may break off the friendship. Selman found that some children as young as
seven and as old as twelve are in this stage.
In stage 3, intimate and mutual sharing, typically between the ages of eight and
fifteen, a friend is someone who you can tell them things you would tell no one else.
Children and teens in this stage no longer “keep score,” and do things for a friend
because they genuinely care for the person. If a friendship dissolves in this stage it is
usually due to a violation of trust. However, children in this stage do expect their
friend to share similar interests and viewpoints and may take it as a betrayal if a
friend likes someone that they do not.
In stage 4, autonomous interdependence, a friend is someone who accepts you and
that you accept as they are. In this stage children, teens, and adults accept and even
appreciate differences between themselves and their friends. They are also not as
possessive, so they are less likely to feel threatened if their friends have other
relationships or interests. Children are typically twelve or older in this stage.

Peer Groups
However, peer relationships can be challenging as well as supportive (Rubin, Coplan, Chen,
Bowker, & McDonald, 2011). Being accepted by other children is an important source of
affirmation and self-esteem, but peer rejection can foreshadow later behavior problems
(especially when children are rejected due to aggressive behavior). With increasing age,
children confront the challenges of bullying, peer victimization, and managing conformity
pressures. Social comparison with peers is an important means by which children evaluate their
skills, knowledge, and personal qualities, but it may cause them to feel that they do not
measure up well against others. For example, a boy who is not athletic may feel unworthy of his
football-playing peers and revert to shy behavior, isolating himself and avoiding conversation.
Conversely, an athlete who doesn’t “get” Shakespeare may feel embarrassed and avoid reading
altogether.

Figure 12.18 - Social comparison with peers is an important means by which children evaluate their value. 49

Also, with the approach of adolescence, peer relationships become focused on psychological
intimacy, involving personal disclosure, vulnerability, and loyalty (or its betrayal)—which
significantly affect a child’s outlook on the world. Each of these aspects of peer relationships
require developing very different social and emotional skills than those that emerge in parentchild relationships. They also illustrate the many ways that peer relationships influence the
growth of personality and self-concept.50

Peer Relationships
Most children want to be liked and accepted by their friends. Some popular children are nice
and have good social skills. These popular-prosocial children tend to do well in school and are
cooperative and friendly. Popular-antisocial children may gain popularity by acting tough or
spreading rumors about others (Cillessen & Mayeux, 2004). Rejected children are sometimes
excluded because they are shy and withdrawn. The withdrawn-rejected children are easy
targets for bullies because they are unlikely to retaliate when belittled (Boulton, 1999). Other
rejected children are ostracized because they are aggressive, loud, and
confrontational. The aggressive-rejected children may be acting out of a feeling of
insecurity. Unfortunately, their fear of rejection only leads to behavior that brings further
rejection from other children. Children who are not accepted are more likely to experience
conflict, lack confidence, and have trouble adjusting.

Figure 12.19 - Peer relationships are particularly important for children. They can be supportive but also
challenging. Peer rejection may lead to behavioral problems later in life. 51

Peer Relationships are studied using sociometric assessment (which measures attraction
between members of a group). Children are asked to mention the three children they like to
play with the most, and those they do not like to play with. The number of times a child is
nominated for each of the two categories (like and do not like) is tabulated. Based on those
tabulations, children are categorized into the following:

Aggression, Antisocial Behavior, Bullies, & Victims
Aggression and Antisocial Behavior
Aggression may be physical or verbal/emotional. Aggression is activated in large part by the
amygdala and regulated by the prefrontal cortex.

Testosterone is associated with increased aggression in both males and females. Aggression is
also caused by negative experiences and emotions, including frustration, pain, and heat. As
predicted by principles of observational learning, research evidence makes it very clear that, on
average, people who watch violent behavior become more aggressive. Early, antisocial behavior
leads to befriending others who also engage in antisocial behavior, which only perpetuates the
downward cycle of aggression and wrongful acts.55

Bullying and Victims
According to Stopbullying.gov (2016), a federal government website managed by the U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services, bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behavior
among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. Further, the
aggressive behavior happens more than once or has the potential to be repeated. There are
different types of bullying, including verbal bullying, which is saying or writing mean things,
teasing, name-calling, taunting, threatening, or making inappropriate sexual comments. Social
bullying, also referred to as relational bullying, involves spreading rumors, purposefully
excluding someone from a group, or embarrassing someone on purpose. Physical bullying
involves hurting a person’s body or possessions.
A more recent form of bullying is cyberbullying, which involves electronic technology. Examples
of cyberbullying include sending mean text messages or emails, creating fake profiles, and
posting embarrassing pictures, videos or rumors on social networking sites. Children who
experience cyberbullying have a harder time getting away from the behavior because it can
occur any time of day and without being in the presence of others (Stopbullying.gov, 2016).56

Figure 12.21 – Cyberbullying can be devastating for children.57

Those at Risk for Bullying
Bullying can happen to anyone but some students are at an increased risk for being bullied,
including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered (LGBT) youth, those with disabilities, and those

who are socially isolated. Additionally, those who are perceived as different, weak, less popular,
overweight, or having low self-esteem, have a higher likelihood of being bullied.

Those Who are More Likely to Bully
Bullies are often thought of as having low self-esteem, and then bully others to feel better
about themselves. Although this can occur, many bullies in fact have high levels of self-esteem.
They possess considerable popularity and social power and have well-connected peer
relationships. They do not lack self-esteem, and instead lack empathy for others. They like to
dominate or be in charge of others.

Bullied Children
Unfortunately, most children do not let adults know that they are being bullied. Some fear
retaliation from the bully, while others are too embarrassed to ask for help. Those who are
socially isolated may not know who to ask for help or believe that no one would care or assist
them if they did ask for assistance. Consequently, it is important for parents and teachers to
know the warning signs that may indicate a child is being bullied. These include: unexplainable
injuries, lost or destroyed possessions, changes in eating or sleeping patterns, declining school
grades, not wanting to go to school, loss of friends, decreased self-esteem and/or selfdestructive behaviors.

Introduction
Adolescence is often defined as the period that begins with puberty and ends with the
transition to adulthood. The commonly accepted beginning age for this period of development
is age 12. When adolescence ends is harder to pin down. When does adulthood truly begin? Are
we an adult at 18 years of age? Or 20? Or even older?
Adolescence physical development has evolved historically, with evidence indicating that this
stage is lengthening as individuals start puberty earlier and transition to adulthood later than in
the past. Puberty today begins, on average, at age 10–11 years for girls and 11–12 years for
boys. This average age of onset has decreased gradually over time since the 19th century by 3–
4 months per decade, which has been attributed to a range of factors including better nutrition,
obesity, increased father absence, and other environmental factors (Steinberg, 2013).
Completion of formal education, financial independence from parents, marriage, and
parenthood have all been markers of the end of adolescence and beginning of adulthood, and
all of these transitions happen, on average, later now than in the past.

Physical Growth
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in an individual’s height and weight during
puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, thyroid hormones, and
androgens. Males experience their growth spurt about two years later than females. The
accelerated growth in various body parts happens at different times, but for all adolescents it
has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities (head, hands, and
feet), followed by the arms and legs, and later the torso and shoulders. This non-uniform
growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion. During puberty,
bones become harder and more brittle.

Before puberty, there are nearly no differences between males and females in the distribution
of fat and muscle. During puberty, males grow muscle much faster than females, and females
experience a higher increase in body fat. An adolescent’s heart and lungs increase in both size
and capacity during puberty; these changes contribute to increased strength and tolerance for
exercise.

Brain Growth
Brain Growth continues into the early 20s. The development of the frontal lobe, in particular, is
important during this stage. Adolescents often engage in increased risk-taking behaviors and
experience heightened emotions during puberty; this may be due to the fact that the frontal
lobes of their brains—which are responsible for judgment, impulse control, and planning—are
still maturing until early adulthood (Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005)

The brain undergoes dramatic changes during adolescence. Although it does not get larger, it
matures by becoming more interconnected and specialized (Giedd, 2015). The myelination and
development of connections between neurons continues. This results in an increase in the
white matter of the brain, and allows the adolescent to make significant improvements in their
thinking and processing skills. Different brain areas become myelinated at different times. For
example, the brain’s language areas undergo myelination during the first 13 years. Completed
insulation of the axons consolidates these language skills but makes it more difficult to learn a
second language. With greater myelination, however, comes diminished plasticity as a myelin
coating inhibits the growth of new connections (Dobbs, 2012).
Even as the connections between neurons are strengthened, synaptic pruning occurs more
than during childhood as the brain adapts to changes in the environment. This synaptic pruning
causes the gray matter of the brain, or the cortex, to become thinner but more efficient (Dobbs,
2012). The corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres, continues to thicken,
allowing for stronger connections between brain areas. Additionally, the hippocampus becomes
more strongly connected to the frontal lobes, allowing for greater integration of memory and
experiences into our decision-making.4

Figure 13.4 – During adolescence the brain becomes more interconnected and specialized.5

The limbic system, which regulates emotion and reward, is linked to the hormonal changes that
occur at puberty. The limbic system is also related to novelty seeking and a shift toward
interacting with peers. In contrast, the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in the control of
impulses, organization, planning, and making good decisions, does not fully develop until the
mid-20s. According to Giedd (2015) the significant aspect of the later developing prefrontal

cortex and early development of the limbic system is the “mismatch” in timing between the
two. The approximately ten years that separates the development of these two brain areas can
result in risky behavior, poor decision-making, and weak emotional control for the adolescent.
When puberty begins earlier, this mismatch extends even further.
Teens often take more risks than adults and, according to research, it is because they weigh
risks and rewards differently than adults do (Dobbs, 2012). For adolescents, the brain’s
sensitivity to the neurotransmitter dopamine peaks, and dopamine is involved in reward
circuits so the possible rewards outweigh the risks. Adolescents respond especially strongly to
social rewards during activities, and they prefer the company of others their same age. In
addition to dopamine, the adolescent brain is affected by oxytocin, which facilitates bonding
and makes social connections more rewarding. With both dopamine and oxytocin engaged, it is
no wonder that adolescents seek peers and excitement in their lives that could end up actually
harming them.
Because of all the changes that occur in the adolescent brain, the chances for abnormal
development can occur, including mental illness. In fact, 50% of mental illness occurs by the age
14 and 75% occurs by age 24 (Giedd, 2015). Additionally, during this period of development the
adolescent brain is especially vulnerable to damage from drug exposure. For example, repeated
exposure to marijuana can affect cellular activity in the endocannabinoid system. Consequently,
adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of repeated marijuana exposure (Weir, 2015).
However, researchers have also focused on the highly adaptive qualities of the adolescent
brain, which allow the adolescent to move away from the family towards the outside world
(Dobbs, 2012; Giedd, 2015). Novelty seeking and risk taking can generate positive outcomes
including meeting new people and seeking out new situations. Separating from the family and
moving into new relationships and different experiences are actually quite adaptive for
society.6

The physical growth and the changes of puberty mark the onset of adolescence (Lerner &
Steinberg, 2009). For both boys and girls, these changes include a growth spurt in height,
growth of pubic and underarm hair, and skin changes (e.g., pimples). Hormones drive these
pubescent changes, particularly the increase in testosterone for boys and estrogen for girls.8

Physical Changes in Adolescence
Adolescence begins with the onset of puberty, a developmental period in which hormonal
changes cause rapid physical alterations in the body, culminating in sexual maturity. Although
the timing varies to some degree across cultures, the average age range for reaching puberty is
between 9 and 14 years for girls and between 10 and 17 years for boys (Marshall & Tanner,
1986). This period of physical development of the adolescent age 9-13 is divided into two
phases.9

Figure 13.6 - Puberty brings dramatic changes in the body, including the development of primary and secondary
sex characteristics.10

The first phase of puberty begins when the pituitary gland begins to stimulate the production of
the male sex hormone testosterone in boys and the female sex hormones estrogen and
progesterone in girls. The release of these sex hormones triggers the development of the
primary sex characteristics, the sex organs concerned with reproduction. It also involves
height increases from 20 to 25 percent. Puberty is second to the prenatal period in terms of

rapid growth as the long bones stretch to their final, adult size. Girls grow 2–8 inches (5–20
centimeters) taller, while boys grow 4–12 inches (10–30 centimeters) taller.
Secondary sexual characteristics are visible physical changes not directly linked to reproduction
but signal sexual maturity. The growth spurt for girls usually occurs earlier than that for boys,
with some boys continuing to grow into their 20s. For males this includes broader shoulders, an
enlarged Adam’s apple, and a lower voice as the larynx grows. Boys typically begin to grow
facial hair between ages 14 and 16, which becomes coarser and darker, and hair growth occurs
in the pubic area, under the arms, and on the face.
For females the enlargement of breasts is usually the first sign of puberty and, on average,
occurs between ages 10 and 12 (Marshall & Tanner, 1986). Girl’s hips broaden and pubic and
underarm hair develops and becomes darker and coarser. Both boys and girls experience a
rapid growth spurt during this stage. Males and females may begin shaving during this time
period as well as showing signs of acne on their faces and bodies.

Figure 13.7 – Males often start shaving during puberty.11

Acne is an unpleasant consequence of the hormonal changes in puberty. Acne is defined as
pimples on the skin due to overactive sebaceous (oil-producing) glands (Dolgin, 2011). These
glands develop at a greater speed than the skin ducts that discharge the oil. Consequently, the
ducts can become blocked with dead skin and acne will develop. According to the University of
California at Los Angeles Medical Center (2000), approximately 85% of adolescents develop
acne, and boys develop acne more than girls because of greater levels of testosterone in their
systems (Dolgin, 2011). Hormones that are also responsible for sexual development can also
wreak havoc on the teenage skin.12
A major milestone in puberty for girls is menarche, the first menstrual period, typically
experienced at around 12 or 13 years of age (Anderson, Dannal, & Must, 2003). The age of

menarche varies substantially and is determined by genetics, as well as by diet and lifestyle,
since a certain amount of body fat is needed to attain menarche. Girls who are very slim, who
engage in strenuous athletic activities, or who are malnourished may begin to menstruate later.
Even after menstruation begins, girls whose level of body fat drops below the critical level may
stop having their periods. The sequence of events for puberty is more predictable than the age
at which they occur. Some girls may begin to grow pubic hair at age 10 but not attain menarche
until age 15.13

Male Anatomy
Males have both internal and external genitalia that are responsible for procreation and sexual
intercourse. Males produce their sperm on a cycle, and unlike the female's ovulation cycle, the
male sperm production cycle is constantly producing millions of sperm daily. The male sex
organs are the penis and the testicles, the latter of which produce semen and sperm. The
semen and sperm, as a result of sexual intercourse, can fertilize an ovum in the female's body;
the fertilized ovum (zygote) develops into a fetus, which is later born as a child.

Male Reproductive System

Figure 13.914

Female Anatomy
Female external genitalia is collectively known as the vulva, which includes the mons veneris,
labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vaginal opening, and urethral opening. Female internal
reproductive organs consist of the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The uterus hosts
the developing fetus, produces vaginal and uterine secretions, and passes the male's sperm
through to the fallopian tubes while the ovaries release the eggs. A female is born with all her
eggs already produced. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the
uterus is attached to the ovaries via the fallopian tubes. Females have a monthly reproductive
cycle; at certain intervals the ovaries release an egg, which passes through the fallopian tube
into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, the sperm might penetrate and merge

with the egg, fertilizing it. If not fertilized, the egg and the tissue that was lining the uterus is
flushed out of the system through menstruation (around every 28 days).

Figure 13.1015

Effects of Puberty on Development
The age of puberty is getting younger for children throughout the world. A century ago the
average age of a girl’s first period in the United States and Europe was 16, while today it is
around 13. Because there is no clear marker of puberty for boys, it is harder to determine if
boys are maturing earlier, too. In addition to better nutrition, less positive reasons associated
with early puberty for girls include increased stress, obesity, and endocrine disrupting.
Because rates of physical development vary so widely among teenagers, puberty can be a
source of pride or embarrassment. Girls and boys who develop more slowly than their peers
may feel self-conscious about their lack of physical development; some research has found that
negative feelings are particularly a problem for late maturing boys, who are at a higher risk for
depression and conflict with parents (Graber et al., 1997) and more likely to be bullied (Pollack
& Shuster, 2000). Additionally, problems are more likely to occur when the child is among the
first in his or her peer group to develop. Because the preadolescent time is one of not wanting
to appear different, early developing children stand out among their peer group and gravitate
toward those who are older (Weir, 2016).
Early maturing boys tend to be physically stronger, taller, and more athletic than their later
maturing peers; this can contribute to differences in popularity among peers, which can in turn
influence the teenager’s confidence. Some studies show that boys who mature earlier tend to
be more popular and independent but are also at a greater risk for substance abuse and early
sexual activity (Flannery, Rowe, & Gulley, 1993; Kaltiala-Heino, Rimpela, Rissanen, & Rantanen,
2001).

Early maturing girls may face increased teasing and sexual harassment related to their
developing bodies, which can contribute to self-consciousness and place them at a higher risk
for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and eating disorders (Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001;
Graber, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Striegel-Moore & Cachelin, 1999).16

The Brain and Sex
The brain is the structure that translates the nerve impulses from the skin into pleasurable
sensations. It controls nerves and muscles used during sexual behavior. The brain regulates the
release of hormones, which are believed to be the physiological origin of sexual desire. The
cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain that allows for thinking and reasoning, is
believed to be the origin of sexual thoughts and fantasies. Beneath the cortex is the limbic
system, which consists of the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and septal area. These
structures are where emotions and feelings are believed to originate, and are important for
sexual behavior.
The hypothalamus is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is the
small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve-cell bodies that
receives input from the limbic system. Studies with lab animals have shown that destruction of
certain areas of the hypothalamus causes complete elimination of sexual behavior. One of the
reasons for the importance of the hypothalamus is that it controls the pituitary gland, which
secretes hormones that control the other glands of the body.

Figure 13.11 - Hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland.17

Hormones
Several important sexual hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland. Oxytocin, also known as
the hormone of love, is released during sexual intercourse when an orgasm is achieved.
Oxytocin is also released in females when they give birth or are breast-feeding; it is believed

that oxytocin is involved with maintaining close relationships. Both prolactin and oxytocin
stimulate milk production in females. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is responsible for
ovulation in females by triggering egg maturity; it also stimulates sperm production in males.
Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers the release of a mature egg in females during the process of
ovulation.
In males, testosterone appears to be a major contributing factor to sexual motivation.
Vasopressin is involved in the male arousal phase, and the increase of vasopressin during
erectile response may be directly associated with increased motivation to engage in sexual
behavior.
The relationship between hormones and female sexual motivation is not as well understood,
largely due to the overemphasis on male sexuality in Western research. Estrogen and
progesterone typically regulate motivation to engage in sexual behavior for females, with
estrogen increasing motivation and progesterone decreasing it. The levels of these hormones
rise and fall throughout a woman's menstrual cycle. Research suggests that testosterone,
oxytocin, and vasopressin are also implicated in female sexual motivation in similar ways as
they are in males, but more research is needed to understand these relationships.

Sexuality will be discussed in Chapter 15, Adolescence Social Emotional Development. The
following section will look at the reasons and the consequences of teenage pregnancy, forms of
birth control, and sexually transmitted diseases.

Adolescent Pregnancy, Birth Control Methods, and Sexually Transmitted Infections

intercourse at least once, though it is hard to be certain of the proportion because of the

sensitivity and privacy of the information. (Center for Disease Control, 2004; Rosenbaum,
2006).

Teen Pregnancy
Although adolescent pregnancy rates have declined since 1991, teenage birth rates in the
United States are higher than most industrialized countries. In 2014, females aged 15–19 years
experienced a birth rate of 24.2 per 1,000 women. This is a drop of 9% from 2013. Birth rates
fell 11% for those aged 15–17 years and 7% for 18–19 year-olds. It appears that adolescents
seem to be less sexually active than in previous years, and those who are sexually active seem
to be using birth control (CDC, 2016).

Figure 13.13 – Birth rates for American
teenagers.19

Figure 13.14 – Birth rates by state.20

Risk Factors for Adolescent Pregnancy
Miller, Benson, and Galbraith (2001) found that parent/child closeness, parental supervision,
and parents' values against teen intercourse (or unprotected intercourse) decreased the risk of
adolescent pregnancy. In contrast, residing in disorganized/dangerous neighborhoods, living in
a lower SES family, living with a single parent, having older sexually active siblings or
pregnant/parenting teenage sisters, early puberty, and being a victim of sexual abuse place
adolescents at an increased risk of adolescent pregnancy.
Consequences of Adolescent Pregnancy
After a child is born life can be difficult for a teenage mother. Only 40% of teenagers who have
children before age 18 graduate from high school. Without a high school degree, her job
prospects are limited and economic independence is difficult. Teen mothers are more likely to
live in poverty and more than 75% of all unmarried teen mothers receive public assistance
within 5 years of the birth of their first child. Approximately, 64% of children born to an

unmarried teenage high-school dropout live in poverty. Further, a child born to a teenage
mother is 50% more likely to repeat a grade in school and is more likely to perform poorly on
standardized tests and drop out before finishing high school (March of Dimes, 2012).21

Figure 13.15 – Effects and risks of teenage pregnancy. 22

Sexually Transmitted Infections
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
or venereal diseases (VDs), are illnesses that have a significant probability of transmission by
means of sexual behavior, including vaginal intercourse, anal sex, and oral sex. It’s important to
mention that some STIs can also be contracted by sharing intravenous drug needles with an
infected person, through childbirth, or breastfeeding. Common STIs include:


According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2014), there was an
increase in the three most common types of STDs in 2014. Those most affected by STDS include
younger, gay/bisexual males, and females. The most effective way to prevent transmission of
STIs is to practice abstinence, (not participating in sexual intercourse), safe sex, and to avoid
direct contact of skin or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Proper use of
safe-sex supplies (such as male condoms, female condoms, gloves, or dental dams) reduces
contact and risk and can be effective in limiting exposure; however, some disease transmission
may occur even with these barriers.23
Practicing safe sex is important to one’s physical health. In the following section we’ll look at
elements of adolescent health, including sleep, diet, and exercise.

the chances of pregnancy.

In choosing a birth control method, dual protection from the simultaneous risk for HIV and
other STIs also should be considered. Although hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are highly
effective at preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STIs, including HIV. Consistent
and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for HIV infection and other STIs,
including chlamydial infection, gonococcal infection, and trichomoniasis.

Adolescent Health: Sleep, Diet, and Exercise
Sleep Health
According to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) (2016), adolescents need about 8 to 10 hours
of sleep each night to function best. The most recent Sleep in America poll in 2006 indicated
that adolescents between sixth and twelfth grade were not getting the recommended amount
of sleep. For the older adolescents, only about one in ten (9%) get an optimal amount of sleep,
and they are more likely to experience negative consequences the following day. These include
feeling too tired or sleepy, being cranky or irritable, falling asleep in school, having a depressed
mood, and drinking caffeinated beverages (NSF, 2016). Additionally, they are at risk for
substance abuse, car crashes, poor academic performance, obesity, and a weakened immune
system (Weintraub, 2016).

Figure 13.17 – Most teenagers aren’t sleeping enough. 28

Why don’t adolescents get adequate sleep? In addition to known environmental and social
factors, including work, homework, media, technology, and socializing, the adolescent brain is
also a factor. As adolescents go through puberty, their circadian rhythms change and push back
their sleep time until later in the evening (Weintraub, 2016). This biological change not only
keeps adolescents awake at night, it makes it difficult for them to get up in the morning. When
they are awake too early, their brains do not function optimally. Impairments are noted in
attention, behavior, and academic achievement, while increases in tardiness and absenteeism
are also demonstrated. Psychologists and other professionals have been advocating for later
school times, and they have produced research demonstrating better student outcomes for

28

later start times. More middle and high schools have changed their start times to better reflect
the sleep research.29

Figure 13.18 – If adolescents get too little sleep, their brain doesn’t function optimally. 30

Eating: Healthy Habits = Healthy Lives
The Dietary Guidelines define late adolescence, as the period from ages fourteen to eighteen.
After puberty, the rate of physical growth slows down. Girls stop growing taller around age
sixteen, while boys continue to grow taller until ages eighteen to twenty. One of the
psychological and emotional changes that take place during this life stage includes the desire
for independence as adolescents develop individual identities apart from their families. As
teenagers make more of their dietary decisions, parents, caregivers, and authority figures
should guide them toward appropriate, nutritious choices.

Some adolescents don’t have all the food necessary for proper development and may be food
insecure. Most people have access to fresh water in all except the most extreme situations; the

need for food is the most fundamental and important human need. More than 1 in 10 U.S.
households contain people who live without enough nourishing food and this lack of proper
nourishment has profound effects on their abilities to lead lives that will allow them to develop
to their fullest potential. (Hunger Notes, n.d.).
When people are extremely hungry, their motivation to attain food completely changes their
behavior. Hungry people become listless and apathetic to save energy and then become
completely obsessed with food. Ancel Keys and his colleagues (Keys, Brožek, Henschel,
Mickelsen, & Taylor, 1950) found that volunteers who were placed on severely reduced-calorie
diets lost all interest in sex and social activities, becoming preoccupied with food. According to
Maslow, meeting one’s basic needs is vital for proper growth and development. 32

Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
Maslow’s theory is based on a simple premise: human beings have needs that are
hierarchically ranked. There are some needs that are basic to all human beings, and in their
absence, nothing else matters. We are ruled by these needs until they are satisfied. After we
satisfy our basic needs, they no longer serve as motivators and we can begin to satisfy higherorder needs.

Figure 13.20 – Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.33

Maslow organized human needs into a pyramid that includes (from lowest-level to highestlevel) physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs. According
to Maslow, one must satisfy lower-level needs before addressing needs that occur higher in

the pyramid. For example, if someone is starving, it is quite unlikely that he will spend a lot of
time, or any time at all, wondering whether other people think he is a good person. Instead,
all of his energies are geared toward finding something to eat.34

Weight Management
Forming good eating habits and engaging in fitness or exercise programs will help maintain a
healthy weight and develop lifelong habits. Research says that the best way to control weight
is: eat less (consume fewer calories) and exercise (burn more calories). To maintain a healthy
weight, restricting your diet alone is difficult and can be substantially improved when it is
accompanied by increased physical activity.
The energy (calorie) requirements for preteens differ according to gender, growth, and activity
level. For ages nine to thirteen, girls should consume about 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day and
boys should consume 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day. Physically active preteens who regularly
participate in sports or exercise need to eat a greater number of calories to account for
increased energy expenditures.35
People who exercise regularly, and in particular those who combine exercise with dieting, are
less likely to be obese (Borer, 2008).Borer, K. T. (2008). Exercise not only improves our
waistline, but also improves our overall mental health by lowering stress and improving feelings
of well-being. Exercise also increases cardiovascular capacity, lowers blood pressure, and helps
improve diabetes, joint flexibility, and muscle strength (American Heart Association, 1998).
For long lasting change, it’s important to plan healthy meals, limit snacking, and to schedule
exercise into our daily lives.36

Diet Extremes - Obesity to Starvation
In this section, we’ll learn about the two ends of the spectrum (or extremes) of nutritional
outcomes.

Obesity
Children need adequate caloric intake for growth, and it is important not to impose highly
restrictive diets. However, exceeding caloric requirements on a regular basis can lead to
childhood obesity, which has become a major problem in North America. Nearly one of three

US children and adolescents are overweight or obese. (Let’s Move. “Learn the Facts.” Accessed
March 5, 2012.http://www.letsmove.gov/learn-facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity.)

Figure 13.21 - Obesity can affect self-esteem, energy, and activity level.37

There are a number of reasons behind the problem of obesity, including:
 larger portion sizes
 limited access to nutrient-rich foods
 increased access to fast foods and vending machines
 lack of breastfeeding support
 declining physical education programs in schools
 insufficient physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle
 media messages encouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods
Obesity has a profound effect on self-esteem, energy, and activity level. Even more importantly,
it is a major risk factor for a number of diseases later in life, including cardiovascular disease,
Type 2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and certain cancers.
A percentile for body mass index (BMI) specific to age and sex is used to determine if a child is
overweight or obese. If a child gains weight inappropriate to growth, parents and caregivers
should limit energy-dense, nutrient-poor snack foods. In addition, it is extremely beneficial to
increase a child’s physical activity and limit sedentary activities, such as watching television,
playing video games, or surfing the Internet. Programs to address childhood obesity can
include behavior modification, exercise counseling, psychological support or therapy, family
counseling, and family meal-planning advice. 38

Eating Disorders
Although eating disorders can occur in children and adults, they frequently appear during the
teen years or young adulthood (National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 2016). Eating

disorders affect both genders, although rates among women are 2 1⁄2 times greater than
among men. Similar to women who have eating disorders, men also have a distorted sense of
body image, including body dysmorphia or an extreme concern with becoming more muscular.
(Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007; Wade, Keski-Rahkonen, & Hudson, 2011).

Figure 13.22 –This image portrays anorexia. No matter how thin she is, she will see herself being heavier. 39

Risk Factors for Eating Disorders
Researchers are finding that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of genetic,
biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors (NIMH, 2016). Eating disorders appear to
run in families, and researchers are working to identify DNA variations that are linked to the
increased risk of developing eating disorders. Researchers have also found differences in
patterns of brain activity in women with eating disorders in comparison with healthy women.
The main criteria for the most common eating disorders: Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa,
and binge-eating disorder are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5)(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and listed in Table

Health Consequences of Eating Disorders
For those suffering from anorexia, health consequences include an abnormally slow heart rate
and low blood pressure, which increases the risk for heart failure. Additionally, there is a
reduction in bone density (osteoporosis), muscle loss and weakness, severe dehydration,
fainting, fatigue, and overall weakness. Individuals with this disorder may die from
complications associated with Anorexia nervosa, which has the highest mortality rate of any
psychiatric disorder.
The binge and purging cycle of bulimia can affect the digestives system and lead to electrolyte
and chemical imbalances that can affect the heart and other major organs. Frequent vomiting
can cause inflammation and possible rupture of the esophagus, as well as tooth decay and
staining from stomach acids. Lastly, binge eating disorder results in similar health risks to
obesity, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, heart disease, Type II diabetes,
and gall bladder disease (National Eating Disorders Association, 2016).

Eating Disorders Treatment
The foundations of treatment for eating disorders include adequate nutrition and discontinuing
destructive behaviors, such as purging. Treatment plans are tailored to individual needs and
include medical care, nutritional counseling, medications (such as antidepressants), and
individual, group, and/or family psychotherapy (NIMH, 2016).41

Drug and Substance Abuse
Drug use and the possibility of abuse and addiction primarily manifest as physical problems.
However, the effects of these substances are not only physical, but also have long lasting
consequences on cognitive development as well as effect social emotional development in a
variety of ways. In the next section we’ll learn about what drugs are, the different kinds of
drugs, and what the effects are of each.

Drug Experimentation
Drug use is, in part, the result of socialization. Adolescents may try drugs when their friends
convince them to, and these decisions are based on social norms about the risks and benefits of
various drugs. Despite the fact that young people have experimented with cigarettes, alcohol,
and other dangerous drugs for many generations, it would be better if they did not. All
recreational drug use is associated with at least some risks, and those who begin using drugs
earlier are also more likely to use more dangerous drugs. They may develop an addiction or
substance abuse problem later on.43

Figure 13.24 – Social norms and peers influence adolescents’ drug use. 44

What Are Drugs?
A psychoactive drug is a chemical that changes our states of consciousness, and particularly our
perceptions and moods. These drugs are commonly found in everyday foods and beverages,
including chocolate, coffee, and soft drinks, as well as in alcohol and in over-the-counter drugs,
such as aspirin, Tylenol, and cold and cough medication. Psychoactive drugs are also frequently
prescribed as sleeping pills, tranquilizers, and antianxiety medications, and they may be taken,
illegally, for recreational purposes. The four primary classes of psychoactive drugs are
stimulants, depressants, opioids, and hallucinogens.

Stimulants
A stimulant is a psychoactive drug that operates by blocking the reuptake of dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin in the synapses of the central nervous system (CNS). Because
more of these neurotransmitters remain active in the brain, the result is an increase in the
activity of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Effects of
stimulants include increased heart and breathing rates, pupil dilation, and increases in blood
sugar accompanied by decreases in appetite. For these reasons, stimulants are frequently used
to help people stay awake and to control weight.
Used in moderation, some stimulants may increase alertness, but used in an irresponsible
fashion they can quickly create dependency. A major problem is the “crash” that results when
the drug loses its effectiveness and the activity of the neurotransmitters returns to normal. The
withdrawal from stimulants can create profound depression and lead to an intense desire to
repeat the high.

A Closer Look at the Danger of Adolescence Use of Nicotine
Nicotine is a psychoactive drug found in the nightshade family of plants, where it acts as a
natural pesticide. Nicotine is the main cause for the dependence-forming properties of
tobacco use, and tobacco use is a major health threat. Nicotine creates both psychological
and physical addiction and it is one of the hardest addictions to break. Nicotine content in
cigarettes has slowly increased over the years, making quitting smoking more and more
difficult. Nicotine is also found in smokeless (chewing) tobacco and electronic cigarettes
(vaping).

A Closer Look at the Danger of Adolescence Use of Nicotine

Figure 13.25 – Electronic devices are now common ways to consume nicotine.45

Nicotine exposure can harm adolescent brain development by changing the way synapses
form, which continues into the early to mid-20s. Using nicotine in adolescence may also
increase risk for future addictions to other drugs. E-cigarette aerosol and cigarettes contain
chemicals that are harmful to the lungs and chewing tobacco.
In many cases, people are able to get past the physical dependence, allowing them to quit
using nicotine containing products at least temporarily. In the long run, however, the
psychological enjoyment of smoking may lead to relapse.46

Depressants
In contrast to stimulants, which work to increase neural activity, a depressant slows down
consciousness. A depressant is a psychoactive drug that reduces the activity of the CNS.
Depressants are widely used as prescription medicines to relieve pain, to lower heart rate and
respiration, and as anticonvulsants. The outcome of depressant use (similar to the effects of
sleep) is a reduction in the transmission of impulses from the lower brain to the cortex (Csaky &
Barnes, 1984).

A Closer Look at the Danger of Adolescent Alcohol Use
Alcohol is the most commonly used of the depressants and is a colorless liquid, produced by
the fermentation of sugar or starch that is the intoxicating agent in fermented drinks. Alcohol
is the oldest and most widely used drug of abuse in the world. In low to moderate doses,
alcohol first acts to remove social inhibitions by slowing activity in the sympathetic nervous
system. In higher doses, alcohol acts on the cerebellum to interfere with coordination and
balance, producing the staggering gait of drunkenness. At high blood levels, further CNS
depression leads to dizziness, nausea, and eventually a loss of consciousness. High enough
blood levels such as those produced by “guzzling” large amounts of hard liquor at parties can
be fatal. Alcohol is not a “safe” drug by any means.47
Short-Term Health Risks
Excessive alcohol use has immediate effects that increase the risk of many harmful health
conditions. These are most often the result of binge drinking (drinking 4-5 drinks during a
single occasion) and include the following:
 Injuries, such as motor vehicle crashes (1 in 5 teen drivers involved in fatal crashes
had some alcohol in their system in 2010), falls, drownings, and burns.
 Violence, including homicide, suicide, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence.
 Alcohol poisoning, a medical emergency that results from high blood alcohol levels.
 Risky sexual behaviors, including unprotected sex or sex with multiple partners. These
behaviors can result in unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases,
including HIV.
 Miscarriage and stillbirth or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) among pregnant
women.

Over time, excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of chronic diseases and other
serious problems including:
 High blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and digestive problems.
 Cancer of the breast, mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and colon.
 Learning and memory problems, including dementia and poor school performance.
 Mental health problems, including depression and anxiety.
 Social problems, including lost productivity, family problems, and unemployment.
 Alcohol dependence, or alcoholism.48

Figure 13.26 – Adolescent alcohol use poses many health risks. 49

Opioids
Opioids are chemicals that increase activity in opioid receptor neurons in the brain and in the
digestive system, producing euphoria, analgesia, slower breathing, and constipation. Their
chemical makeup is similar to the endorphins, the neurotransmitters that serve as the body’s
“natural pain reducers.” Natural opioids are derived from the opium poppy, which is
widespread in Eurasia, but they can also be created synthetically.

Hallucinogens
The drugs that produce the most extreme alteration of consciousness are the hallucinogens,
psychoactive drugs that alter sensation and perception and that may create hallucinations. The
hallucinogens are frequently known as “psychedelics.” Drugs in this class include lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD, or “Acid”), mescaline, and phencyclidine (PCP), as well as a number of
natural plants including cannabis (marijuana), peyote, and psilocybin. The hallucinogens may
produce striking changes in perception through one or more of the senses. The precise effects a
user experiences are a function not only of the drug itself but also of the user’s preexisting
mental state and expectations of the drug experience. In large part, the user tends to get out of
the experience what he or she brings to it. The hallucinations that may be experienced when
taking these drugs are strikingly different from everyday experience and frequently are more
similar to dreams than to everyday consciousness.

A Closer Look at the Danger of Adolescent Marijuana Use50
Marijuana (cannabis) is the most widely used hallucinogen. Until it was banned in the United
States under the Marijuana Tax Act of 1938, it was widely used for medical purposes. While
medical and recreational marijuana is now legal in several American states, it is still banned

under federal law, putting those states in conflict with the federal government. Marijuana
also acts as a stimulant, producing giggling, laughing, and mild intoxication. It acts to enhance
perception of sights, sounds, and smells, and may produce a sensation of time slowing down,
and is much less likely to lead to antisocial acts than that other popular intoxicant, alcohol.
Using marijuana—can have harmful and long-lasting effects on an adolescent’s health and
well-being.
Marijuana and the teen brain
Unlike adults, the teen brain is actively developing and often will not be fully developed until
the mid 20s. Marijuana use during this period may harm the developing teen brain.
Negative effects include:
 Difficulty thinking and problem solving.
 Problems with memory and learning.
 Impaired coordination.
 Difficulty maintaining attention.

Figure 13.27 – Marijuana is a commonly used hallucinogen. 51

Negative effects on school and social life
Marijuana use in adolescence or early adulthood can have a serious impact on an
adolescent’s life.
 Decline in school performance. Students who smoke marijuana may get lower grades
and may be more likely to drop out of high school than their peers who do not use.
 Increased risk of mental health issues. Marijuana use has been linked to a range of
mental health problems in teens such as depression or anxiety. Psychosis has also
been seen in teens at higher risk like those with a family history.
 Impaired driving. Driving while impaired by any substance, including marijuana, is
dangerous. Marijuana negatively affects a number of skills required for safe driving,
such as reaction time, coordination, and concentration.



Potential for addiction. Research shows that about 1 in 6 teens who repeatedly use
marijuana can become addicted, which means that they may make unsuccessful
efforts to quit using marijuana or may give up important activities with friends and
family in favor of using marijuana.

In some cases, the effects of psychoactive drugs mimic other naturally occurring states of
consciousness. For instance, sleeping pills are prescribed to create drowsiness, and
benzodiazepines are prescribed to create a state of relaxation. In other cases psychoactive
drugs are taken for recreational purposes with the goal of creating states of consciousness that
are pleasurable or that help us escape our normal consciousness.
The use of psychoactive drugs, and especially those that are used illegally, has the potential to
create very negative side effects. This does not mean that all drugs are dangerous, but rather
that all drugs can be dangerous, particularly if they are used regularly over long periods of time.
Psychoactive drugs create negative effects not so much through their initial use but through the
continued use, accompanied by increasing doses, that ultimately may lead to drug abuse.

Substance Abuse
Many drugs create tolerance: an increase in the dose required to produce the same effect,
which makes it necessary for the user to increase the dosage or the number of times per day
that the drug is taken. As the use of the drug increases, the user may develop a dependence,
defined as a need to use a drug or other substance regularly. Dependence can be psychological,
in which the drug is desired and has become part of the everyday life of the user, but no serious
physical effects result if the drug is not obtained; or physical, in which serious physical and
mental effects appear when the drug is withdrawn. Cigarette smokers who try to quit, for
example, experience physical withdrawal symptoms, such as becoming tired and irritable, as
well as extreme psychological cravings to enjoy a cigarette in particular situations, such as after
a meal or when they are with friends. Users may wish to stop using the drug, but when they
reduce their dosage they experience withdrawal—negative experiences that accompany
reducing or stopping drug use, including physical pain and other symptoms. When the user
powerfully craves the drug and is driven to seek it out, over and over again, no matter what the
physical, social, financial, and legal cost, we say that he or she has developed an addiction to
the drug.
It is a common belief that addiction is an overwhelming, irresistibly powerful force, and that
withdrawal from drugs is always an unbearably painful experience. But the reality is more
complicated and in many cases less extreme. For one, even drugs that we do not generally think
of as being addictive, such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, can be very difficult to quit using,
at least for some people. On the other hand, drugs that are normally associated with addiction,
including amphetamines, cocaine, and heroin, do not immediately create addiction in their
users. Even for a highly addictive drug like cocaine, only about 15% of users become addicted

355 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

(Robinson & Berridge, 2003; Wagner & Anthony, 2002). Furthermore, the rate of addiction is
lower for those who are taking drugs for medical reasons than for those who are using drugs
recreationally. Patients who have become physically dependent on morphine administered
during the course of medical treatment for a painful injury or disease are able to be rapidly
weaned off the drug afterward, without becoming addicts.52
People have used, and often abused, psychoactive drugs for thousands of years. Perhaps this
should not be surprising, because many people find using drugs to be enjoyable. Even when we
know the potential costs of using drugs, we may engage in them anyway because the pleasures
of using the drugs are occurring right now, whereas the potential costs are abstract and occur
in the future.53
In the next section we will be looking at various psychological disorders. Learning about and
supporting others seeking help when they have a substance abuse problem is just as important
as seeking help when one is experiencing negative physical and mental health problems.

Maintaining Emotional Health
Emotional regulation is the ability to successfully control our emotions, which takes effort, but
the ability to do so can have important positive health outcomes. Emotional responses such as
the stress reaction are useful in warning us about potential danger and in mobilizing our
response to it, so it is a good thing that we have them. However, we also need to learn how to
control and regulate our emotions, to prevent them from letting our behavior get out of
control.54
Stress may not be a disorder, but if it continues and becomes more intense and debilitating, it
may lead to a disorder. We experience stress in our everyday lives, including daily hassles.
People who experience strong negative emotions as a result of these hassles, exhibit negative
stress responses. Stress can be managed by using coping strategies and by becoming better at
emotional regulation. The best antidote for stress is to think positively, have fun, and enjoy the
company of others. People who express optimism, self-efficacy, and grit tend to cope better
with stress and experience better health overall.55

Disorders and Syndromes
A psychological disorder is an unusual, distressing, and dysfunctional pattern of thought,
emotion, or behavior. Psychological disorders are often co-occurring or comorbid, meaning
that a given person suffers from more than one disorder. Psychologists diagnose a disorder
using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). When diagnosed,
people feel that a mental disorder is a stigma, but mental illness is not a “fault,” and it is

various disorders that may affect children, adolescence, and adults.

Table 13.7 – Disorders and Syndromes56 and their Descriptions
Disorder/Syndrome

Description

Anxiety Disorders

Psychological disturbances marked by irrational fears, often of everyday
objects and situations. They include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
panic disorder, phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety disorders affect about 57
million Americans every year.

Dissociative
Disorders

Conditions that involve disruptions or breakdowns of memory,
awareness, and identity. They include dissociative amnesia, dissociative
fugue, and dissociative identity disorder.

Mood Disorders

Psychological disorders in which the person’s mood negatively
influences his or her physical, perceptual, social, and cognitive
processes. They include dysthymia, major depressive disorder, and
bipolar disorder. Mood disorders affect about 30 million Americans
every year.

Schizophrenia

A serious psychological disorder marked by delusions, hallucinations,
loss of contact with reality, inappropriate affect, disorganized speech,
social withdrawal, and deterioration of adaptive behavior. About 3
million Americans have schizophrenia.

Personality
Disorder

A long-lasting but frequently less severe disorder characterized by
inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, or relating to others that causes
problems in personal, social, and work situations. They are
characterized by odd or eccentric behavior, by dramatic or erratic
behavior, or by anxious or inhibited behavior. Two of the most
important personality disorders are borderline personality disorder
(BPD) and antisocial personality disorder (APD).

Somatization
Disorder

A psychological disorder in which a person experiences numerous longlasting but seemingly unrelated physical ailments that have no
identifiable physical cause. Somatization disorders include conversion
disorder, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and hypochondriasis.

Factitious
Disorder

When patients fake physical symptoms in large part because they enjoy
the attention and treatment that they receive in the hospital.

Disorder/Syndrome

Description

Sexual Disorders

A variety of problems revolving around performing or enjoying sex.
Sexual dysfunctions include problems relating to loss of sexual desire,
sexual response or orgasm, and pain during sex.

Paraphilia

A sexual deviation where sexual arousal is obtained from a consistent
pattern of inappropriate responses to objects or people, and in which
the behaviors associated with the feelings are distressing and
dysfunctional.

Depression

When symptoms cause serious distress and negatively influence
physical, perceptual, social, and cognitive processes. Teens with
depression were often dismissed as being moody or difficult. About 11
percent of adolescents have a depressive disorder by age 18 according
to the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A).
Depressed teens with coexisting (comorbid) disorders such as substance
abuse problems are less likely to respond to treatment for depression.
Studies focusing on conditions that frequently co-occur and how they
affect one another may lead to more targeted screening tools and
interventions. With medication, psychotherapy, or combined treatment,
most youth with depression can be effectively treated. Youth are more
likely to respond to treatment if they receive it early in the course of
their illness.

The Importance of Maintaining Mental Health and Wellness
Most people don’t think twice before going to a doctor if they have an illness such as bronchitis,
asthma, diabetes, or heart disease. However, many people who have a mental illness don’t get
the treatment that would alleviate their suffering. Studies estimate that two-thirds of all young
people with mental health problems are not receiving the help they need and that less than
one-third of the children under age 18 who have a serious mental health problem receive any
mental health services. Mental illness in adults often goes untreated, too.

Consequences of Mental Illness
The consequences of mental illness in children and adolescents can be substantial. Many
mental health professionals speak of accrued deficits that occur when mental illness in children
is not treated. To begin with, mental illness can impair a student’s ability to learn. Adolescents
whose mental illness is not treated rapidly and aggressively tend to fall further and further
behind in school. They are more likely to drop out of school and are less likely to be fully
functional members of society when they reach adulthood.
We also now know that depressive disorders in young people confer a higher risk for illness and
interpersonal and psychosocial difficulties that persist after the depressive episode is over.
Furthermore, many adults who suffer from mental disorders have problems that originated in

358 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

childhood. Depression in youth may predict more severe illness in adult life. Attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, once thought to affect children and adolescents only, may persist into
adulthood and may be associated with social, legal, and occupational problems. Mental illness
impairs a student’s ability to learn.

Figure 13.28 - Cycle of Depression: Negative emotions create negative behaviors, which lead people to respond
negatively to the individual, creating even more depression. 57

Self-Harm or Self-Injury
Adolescents struggling with their mental health may engage in self-harm, or thinking about
harming oneself. They may be distressed and have difficult feelings as well as the urge to hurt
themselves. Some unhealthy ways people may try to relieve emotional pain include cutting,
burning, or hitting themselves. These self-harm behaviors can be difficult to detect and are
usually kept a secret by covering the wounds with clothing or jewelry. Self-injury is a sign that
someone is struggling. People who are anxious, depressed, or have an eating disorder are also
more likely to turn to self-injuring behaviors.
Indicators of self-harm include:
 frequent unexplained injuries
 clues like bandages in trash cans.
 clothing inappropriate for the weather (long pants or sleeves when it’s hot)
It’s important when someone confides in self-harm to try to be as nonreactive and
nonjudgmental as possible. At this time there are no medications for treating self-injuring

behaviors. But some medications can help treat mental disorders that the person may be
dealing with, like depression or anxiety. Mental health counseling or therapy can also help.58

Figure 13.29 – Self-injury can be difficult to detect because it can be hidden under clothing. 59

Suicidal Behavior
Adolescence who feel like there is no possible resolution to their mental health struggles may
consider, attempt, or commit suicide. Suicidal behavior causes immeasurable pain, suffering,
and loss to individuals, families, and communities nationwide. On average, 112 Americans die
by suicide each day. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds and
more than 9.4 million adults in the United States had serious thoughts of suicide within the past
12 months. But suicide is preventable.
Warning Signs of Suicide
If someone is showing one or more of the following behaviors, he or she may be thinking about
suicide. The following warning signs should not be ignored. Help should be sought immediately.
 Talking about wanting to die or to kill oneself
 Looking for a way to kill oneself
 Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live
 Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain
 Talking about being a burden to others
 Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs
 Acting anxious or agitated
 Behaving recklessly
 Sleeping too little or too much
 Withdrawing or feeling isolated
 Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge
 Displaying extreme mood swings60

Introduction
During adolescence more complex thinking abilities emerge. Researchers suggest this is due to
increases in processing speed and efficiency rather than as the result of an increase in mental
capacity—in other words, due to improvements in existing skills rather than development of
new ones (Bjorkland, 1987; Case, 1985). Let’s explore these improvements.

Cognitive Development in Adolescence
During adolescence, teenagers move beyond concrete thinking and become capable of abstract
thought. Teen thinking is also characterized by the ability to consider multiple points of view,
imagine hypothetical situations, debate ideas and opinions (e.g., politics, religion, and justice),
and form new ideas. In addition, it’s not uncommon for adolescents to question authority or
challenge established societal norms.
Cognitive empathy, also known as theory-of-mind, which relates to the ability to take the
perspective of others and feel concern for others (Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer, & Aharon-Peretz,
2005). Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of
social problem solving and conflict avoidance. According to one longitudinal study, levels of
cognitive empathy begin rising in girls around 13 years old, and around 15 years old in boys
(Van der Graaff et al., 2013).1

Cognitive Changes in the Brain
Early in adolescence, changes in Dopamine, a chemical in the brain that is a neurotransmitter
and produces feelings of pleasure, can contribute to increases in adolescents’ sensation-seeking
and reward motivation. During adolescence, people tend to do whatever activities produce the
1

most dopamine without fully considering the consequences of such actions. Later in
adolescence, the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for outcomes, forming
judgments, controlling impulses and emotions, also continues to develop (Goldberg, 2001). The
difference in timing of the development of these different regions of the brain contributes to
more risk taking during middle adolescence because adolescents are motivated to seek thrills
(Steinberg, 2008). One of the world’s leading experts on adolescent development, Laurence
Steinberg, likens this to engaging a powerful engine before the braking system is in place. The
result is that adolescents are prone to risky behaviors more often than children or adults.

Figure 14.2 - A simulation of the risky behavior of drinking and driving.2

Although the most rapid cognitive changes occur during childhood, the brain continues to
develop throughout adolescence, and even into the 20s (Weinberger, Elvevåg, & Giedd, 2005).
The brain continues to form new neural connections and becomes faster and more efficient
because it prunes, or casts off unused neurons and connections (Blakemore, 2008), and
produces myelin, the fatty tissue that forms around axons and neurons, which helps speed
transmissions between different regions of the brain (Rapoport et al., 1999). This time of rapid
cognitive growth for teens, making them more aware of their potential and capabilities, causes
a great amount of disequilibrium for them. Theorists have researched cognitive changes and
functions and have formed theories based on this developmental period.3

Cognitive Theorists: Piaget, Elkind, Kohlberg, and Gilligan
Jean Piaget: Formal Operational Stage of Cognitive Development
Cognition refers to thinking and memory processes, and cognitive development refers to longterm changes in these processes. One of the most widely known perspectives about cognitive
development is the cognitive stage theory of a Swiss psychologist named Jean Piaget. Piaget
created and studied an account of how children and youth gradually become able to think
logically and scientifically. Because his theory is especially popular among educators, we focus
on it in this chapter.

Piaget was a psychological constructivist: in his view, learning was proceeded by the interplay
of assimilation (adjusting new experiences to fit prior concepts) and accommodation (adjusting
concepts to fit new experiences). The to-and-fro of these two processes leads not only to shortterm learning, but also to long-term developmental change. The long-term developments are
really the main focus of Piaget’s cognitive theory.
As you might remember, Piaget proposed that cognition developed through distinct stages
from birth through the end of adolescence. By stages he meant a sequence of thinking patterns
with four key features:
1. They always happen in the same order.
2. No stage is ever skipped.
3. Each stage is a significant transformation of the stage before it.
4. Each later stage incorporated the earlier stages into itself.
Basically this is the “staircase” model of development. Piaget proposed four major stages of
cognitive development, and called them (1) sensorimotor intelligence, (2) preoperational
thinking, (3) concrete operational thinking, and (4) formal operational thinking. Each stage is
correlated with an age period of childhood, but only approximately. Formal operational
thinking appears in adolescence.4
During the formal operational stage, adolescents are able to understand abstract principles.
They are no longer limited by what can be directly seen or heard, and are able to contemplate
such constructs as beauty, love, freedom, and morality. Additionally, while younger children
solve problems through trial and error, adolescents demonstrate hypothetical-deductive
reasoning, which is developing hypotheses based on what might logically occur. They are able
to think about all the possibilities in a situation beforehand, and then test them systematically,
(Crain, 2005) because they are able to engage in true scientific thinking.

Figure 14.1 - Teenage thinking is characterized by the ability to reason logically and solve hypothetical problems
such as how to design, plan, and build a structure.5

Figure 14.3 – Piaget proposed that formal operational thinking is the last stage in cognitive development.6

Does everyone reach formal operations?
According to Piaget, most people attain some degree of formal operational thinking, but use
formal operations primarily in the areas of their strongest interest (Crain, 2005). In fact, most
adults do not regularly demonstrate formal operational thought. A possible explanation is that
an individual’s thinking has not been sufficiently challenged to demonstrate formal operational
thought in all areas.

Adolescent Egocentrism
Once adolescents can understand abstract thoughts, they enter a world of hypothetical
possibilities and demonstrate egocentrism, a heightened self-focus. The egocentricity comes
from attributing unlimited power to their own thoughts (Crain, 2005). Piaget believed it was not
until adolescents took on adult roles that they would be able to learn the limits to their own
thoughts.

David Elkind: On Piaget’s Theory
David Elkind (1967) expanded on the concept of Piaget’s adolescent egocentricity. Elkind
theorized that the physiological changes that occur during adolescence result in adolescents
being primarily concerned with themselves. Additionally, since adolescents fail to differentiate
6

365 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

between what others are thinking and their own thoughts, they believe that others are just as
fascinated with their behavior and appearance. This belief results in the adolescent anticipating
the reactions of others, and consequently constructing an imaginary audience. The imaginary
audience is the adolescent’s belief that those around them are as concerned and focused on
their appearance as they themselves are (Schwartz, Maynard, & Uzelac, 2008, p. 441). Elkind
thought that the imaginary audience contributed to the self-consciousness that occurs during
early adolescence. The desire for privacy and the reluctance to share personal information may
be a further reaction to feeling under constant observation by others.

Figure 14.4 - This teen is likely thinking, “they must be whispering about me.”7

Another important consequence of adolescent egocentrism is the personal fable or belief that
one is unique, special, and invulnerable to harm. Elkind (1967) explains that because
adolescents feel so important to others (imaginary audience) they regard themselves and their
feelings as being special and unique. Adolescents believe that only they have experienced
strong and diverse emotions, and therefore others could never understand how they feel. This
uniqueness in one’s emotional experiences reinforces the adolescent’s belief of invulnerability,
especially to death. Adolescents will engage in risky behaviors, such as drinking and driving or
unprotected sex, and feel they will not suffer any negative consequences. Elkind believed that
adolescent egocentricity emerged in early adolescence and declined in middle adolescence,
however, recent research has also identified egocentricity in late adolescence (Schwartz, et al.,
2008).

Consequences of Formal Operational Thought
As adolescents are now able to think abstractly and hypothetically, they exhibit many new ways
of reflecting on information (Dolgin, 2011). For example, they demonstrate greater
introspection or thinking about one’s thoughts and feelings. They begin to imagine how the
world could be, which leads them to become idealistic or insisting upon high standards of
behavior. Because of their idealism, they may become critical of others, especially adults in

their life. Additionally, adolescents can demonstrate hypocrisy, or pretend to be what they are
not. Since they are able to recognize what others expect of them, they will conform to those
expectations for their emotions and behavior seemingly hypocritical to themselves. Lastly,
adolescents can exhibit pseudostupidity, which is when they approach problems at a level that
is too complex and they fail because the tasks are too simple. Their new ability to consider
alternatives is not completely under control and they appear “stupid” when they are in fact
bright, just inexperienced.8

Lawrence Kohlberg: Moral Development
Kohlberg (1963) built on the work of Piaget and was interested in finding out how our moral
reasoning changes as we get older. He wanted to find out how people decide what is right and
what is wrong (moral justice). Just as Piaget believed that children’s cognitive development
follows specific patterns, Kohlberg argued that we learn our moral values through active
thinking and reasoning, and that moral development follows a series of stages. Kohlberg's six
stages are generally organized into three levels of moral reasons. To study moral development,
Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to children, teenagers, and adults. You may remember one
such dilemma, the Heinz dilemma, that was introduced in Chapter 12:9
A woman was on her deathbed. There was one drug that the doctors thought
might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had
recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was
charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the
radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's
husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could
only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist
that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But
the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from
it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug
for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for
his wife? Why or why not?10
Based on their reasoning behind their responses (not whether they thought Heinz made the
right choice or not), Kohlberg placed each person in one of the stages as described in the image
on the following page:

Figure 14.5 - Kohlberg's six stages of moral development.11

Although research has supported Kohlberg’s idea that moral reasoning changes from an early
emphasis on punishment and social rules and regulations to an emphasis on more general
ethical principles, as with Piaget’s approach, Kohlberg’s stage model is probably too simple. For
one, children may use higher levels of reasoning for some types of problems, but revert to
lower levels in situations where doing so is more consistent with their goals or beliefs (Rest,
1979). Second, it has been argued that this stage model is particularly appropriate for Western
countries, rather than non-Western, samples in which allegiance to social norms (such as
respect for authority) may be particularly important (Haidt, 2001). In addition, there is little
correlation between how children score on the moral stages and how they behave in real life.

Perhaps the most important critique of Kohlberg’s theory is that it may describe the moral
development of boys better than it describes that of girls. Carol Gilligan has argued that,
because of differences in their socialization, males tend to value principles of justice and rights,
whereas females value caring for and helping others. Although there is little evidence that boys
and girls score differently on Kohlberg’s stages of moral development (Turiel, 1998), it is true
that girls and women tend to focus more on issues of caring, helping, and connecting with
others than do boys and men (Jaffee & Hyde, 2000).12

Carol Gilligan: Morality of Care
Carol Gilligan, whose ideas center on a morality of care, or system of beliefs about human
responsibilities, care, and consideration for others, proposed three moral positions that
represent different extents or breadth of ethical care. Unlike Kohlberg, or Piaget, she does not
claim that the positions form a strictly developmental sequence, but only that they can be
ranked hierarchically according to their depth or subtlety. In this respect her theory is “semidevelopmental” in a way similar to Maslow’s theory of motivation (Brown & Gilligan, 1992;
Taylor, Gilligan, & Sullivan, 1995). The following table summarizes the three moral positions
from Gilligan’s theory:

Table 14.1 - Positions of Moral Development According to Gilligan
Moral Positions
Position 1: Survival Orientation
Position 2: Conventional Care
Position 3: Integrated Care

Definition of What is Morally Good
Action that considers one’s personal needs only
Action that considers others’ needs or preferences but no
one’s own
Action that attempts to coordinate one’s own personal
needs with those of others

Position 1: Caring as Survival
The most basic kind of caring is a survival orientation, in which a person is concerned primarily
with his or her own welfare. As a moral position, a survival orientation is obviously not
satisfactory for classrooms on a widespread scale. If every student only looked out for himself
or herself alone, classroom life might become rather unpleasant. Nonetheless, there are
situations in which caring primarily about yourself is both a sign of good mental health and also
relevant to teachers. For a child who has been bullied at school or sexually abused at home, for
example, it is both healthy and morally desirable to speak out about the bullying or abuse—
essentially looking out for the victim’s own needs at the expense of others’, including the bully’s
or abuser’s. Speaking out requires a survival orientation and is healthy because in this case, the
child is at least caring about herself.

369 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Position 2: Conventional Caring
A more subtle moral position is caring for others, in which a person is concerned about others’
happiness and welfare, and about reconciling or integrating others’ needs where they conflict
with each other. In classrooms, students who operate from Position 2 can be very desirable in
some ways; they can be kind, considerate, and good at fitting in and at working cooperatively
with others. Because these qualities are very welcome in a busy classroom, it can be tempting
for teachers to reward students for developing and using them for much of their school careers.
The problem with rewarding Position 2 ethics, however, is that doing so neglects the student’s
identity—his or her own academic and personal goals or values. Sooner or later, personal goals,
values and identity need attention, and educators have a responsibility for assisting students to
discover and clarify them. Unfortunately for teachers, students who know what they want may
sometimes be more assertive and less automatically compliant than those who do not.

Position 3: Integrated Caring
The most developed form of moral caring in Gilligan’s model is integrated caring, the
coordination of personal needs and values with those of others. Now the morally good choice
takes account of everyone including yourself, not everyone except yourself.
In classrooms, integrated caring is most likely to surface whenever teachers give students wide,
sustained freedom to make choices. If students have little flexibility about their actions, there is
little room for considering anyone’s needs or values, whether their own or others’. If the
teacher says simply, “Do the homework on page 50 and turn it in tomorrow morning,” then
compliance becomes the main issue, not moral choice. But suppose instead that she says
something like this: “Over the next two months, figure out an inquiry project about the use of
water resources in our town. Organize it any way you want—talk to people, read widely about
it, and share it with the class in a way that all of us, including yourself, will find meaningful.”
Although an assignment this general or abstract may not suit some teachers or students, it does
pose moral challenges for those who do use it. Why? For one thing, students cannot simply
carry out specific instructions, but must decide what aspect of the topic really matters to them.
The choice is partly a matter of personal values. For another thing, students have to consider
how the topic might be meaningful or important to others in the class. Third, because the time
line for completion is relatively far in the future, students may have to weigh personal priorities
(like spending time with family on the weekend) against educational priorities (working on the
assignment a bit more on the weekend). Some students might have trouble making good
choices when given this sort of freedom—and their teachers might therefore be cautious about
giving such an assignment. But in a way these hesitations are part of Gilligan’s point: integrated
caring is indeed more demanding than the caring based on survival or orientation to others,
and not all students may be ready for it. 13

We’ve learned that major changes in the structure and functioning of the brain occur during
adolescence and result in the theories about cognitive and behavioral developments (Steinberg,
2008). These cognitive changes include how information is processed, and are fostered by
improvements in cognitive function during early adolescence such as in memory, encoding, and
storage as well as ability to think about thinking, therefore becoming better at information
processing functions.14

Information Processing Theory: Memory, Encoding, and Storage

Figure 14.6 – The brain’s developments during adolescence allow for greater information processing functions. 15

Memory
Memory is an information processing system that we often compare to a computer. Memory is
the set of processes used to encode, store, and retrieve information over different periods of
time.

Figure 14.7 – The memory process.16

Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system. Storage is the retention of
the encoded information. Retrieval, or getting the information out of memory and back into
awareness, is the third function.

Encoding (Input of Information to Memory)
We get information into our brains through a process called encoding, which is the input of
information into the memory system. Once we receive sensory information from the
environment, our brains label or code it. We organize the information with other similar
information and connect new concepts to existing concepts. Encoding information occurs
through both automatic processing and effortful processing. For example, if someone asks you
what you ate for lunch today, more than likely you could recall this information quite easily.
This is known as automatic processing, or the encoding of details like time, space, frequency,
and the meaning of words. Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious
awareness.
Recalling the last time you studied for a test is another example of automatic processing. But
what about the actual test material you studied? It probably required a lot of work and
attention on your part to encode that information; this is known as effortful processing. When
you first learn new skills such as driving a car, you have to put forth effort and attention to
encode information about how to start a car, how to brake, how to handle a turn, and so on.
Once you know how to drive, you can encode additional information about this skill
automatically.

Storage (Retaining Information in Memory)
Once the information has been encoded, we have to retain it. Our brains take the encoded
information and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent record of
information. In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass
through three distinct stages: Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term
Memory. These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin (1968).
Their model of human memory, called Atkinson-Shiffrin (A-S), is based on the belief that we
process memories in the same way that a computer processes information.

372 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

Figure 14.8 - According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory, information passes through three distinct stages
in order for it to be stored in long-term memory.17

Sensory Memory (First Stage of Storage)
In the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory
memory, storage of brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes. It is very brief
storage—up to a couple of seconds. We are constantly bombarded with sensory information.
We cannot absorb all of it, or even most of it. And most of it has no impact on our lives. For
example, what was your professor wearing the last class period? As long as the professor was
dressed appropriately, it does not really matter what they were wearing. Sensory information
about sights, sounds, smells, and even textures, which we do not view as valuable information,
we discard. If we view something as valuable, the information will move into our short-term
memory system.
One study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on shortterm memory storage. J. R. Stroop discovered a memory phenomenon in the 1930s: you will
name a color more easily if it appears printed in that color, which is called the Stroop effect.
The Stroop Effect describes why it is difficult for us to name a color when the word and the
color of the word are different. To test this out a person is instructed not to read the words
below, but to say the color the word is printed in. For example, upon seeing the word “yellow”
in green print, they should say “green,” not “yellow.” This experiment is fun, but it’s not as easy
as it seems.

Short-Term Memory or Working Memory (Second Stage of Storage)
Short-term memory is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory;
sometimes it is called working memory. Short-term memory takes information from sensory
memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long-term memory.
Short-term memory storage lasts about 20 seconds. Think of short-term memory as the
information you have displayed on your computer screen—a document, a spreadsheet, or a
web page. Information in short-term memory either goes to long-term memory (when you save
it to your hard drive) or it is discarded (when you delete a document or close a web browser).
George Miller (1956), in his research on the capacity of memory, found that most people can
retain about seven items in short-term memory. Some remember five, some nine, so he called
the capacity of short-term memory the range of seven items plus or minus two.
To explore the capacity and duration of short-term memory, two people can try this activity.
One person reads the strings of random numbers below out loud to the other, beginning each
string by saying, “Ready?” and ending each by saying, “Recall.” Then the second person should
try to write down the string of numbers from memory.

This can be used to determine the longest string of digits that you can store. For most people,
this will be close to seven, Miller’s famous seven plus or minus two. Recall is somewhat better
for random numbers than for random letters (Jacobs, 1887) and is also often slightly better for
information we hear (acoustic encoding, which is the encoding of sounds) rather than what we
see (visual encoding, which is the encoding of images and words in particular) (Anderson,
1969).

Long-Term Memory (Third and Final Stage of Storage)
Long-term memory is the continuous storage of information. Unlike short-term memory, the
storage capacity of long-term memory has no limits. It encompasses all the things you can
remember that happened more than just a few minutes ago to all of the things that you can
remember that happened days, weeks, and years ago. In keeping with the computer analogy,
the information in your long-term memory would be like the information you have saved on
the hard drive. It isn’t there on your desktop (your short-term memory), but you can pull up this
information when you want it, at least most of the time. Not all long-term memories are strong
memories. Some memories can only be recalled through prompts. For example, you might
easily recall a fact— “What is the capital of the United States?”—or a procedure—“How do you
ride a bike?”—but you might struggle to recall the name of the restaurant you had dinner at
when you were on vacation in France last summer. A prompt, such as that the restaurant was
named after its owner, who spoke to you about your shared interest in soccer, may help you
recall (retrieve) the name of the restaurant.

Retrieval (Finding Memories)
So you have worked hard to encode via effortful processing (a lot of work and attention on your
part in order to encode that information) and store some important information for your
upcoming final exam. How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it?
The act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is
known as retrieval. This would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously
saved on your computer’s hard drive. Now it’s back on your desktop, and you can work with it
again. Our ability to retrieve information from long-term memory is vital to our everyday
functioning. You must be able to retrieve information from memory in order to do everything
from knowing how to brush your hair and teeth, to driving to work, to knowing how to perform
your job once you get there.

Long-Term Memory Retrieval (Storage System): Recall, Recognition, Relearning, and
Forgetting
There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long-term memory storage
system: recall, recognition, and relearning. Recall is what we most often think about when we
talk about memory retrieval: it means you can access information without cues. For example,
you would use recall for an essay test. Recognition happens when you identify information that
you have previously learned after encountering it again. It involves a process of comparison.
When you take a multiple-choice test, you are relying on recognition to help you choose the
correct answer. The third form of retrieval is relearning, and it’s just what it sounds like, it
involves learning information that you previously learned. Whitney took Spanish in high school,
but after high school she did not have the opportunity to speak Spanish. Whitney is now 31,
and her company has offered her an opportunity to work in their Mexico City office. In order to
prepare herself, she enrolls in a Spanish course at the local community college. She’s surprised
at how quickly she’s able to pick up the language after not speaking it for 13 years; this is an
example of relearning.

Forgetting (It Wasn’t Locked In)
As we just learned, your brain must do some work (effortful processing) to encode information
and move it into short-term, and ultimately long-term memory. This has strong implications for
a student, as it can impact their learning – if one doesn’t work to encode and store information,
it will likely be forgotten. Research indicates that people forget 80 percent of what they learn
only a day later. This statistic may not sound very encouraging, given all that you’re expected to
learn and remember as a college student. Really, though, it points to the importance of a study
strategy other than waiting until the night before a final exam to review a semester’s worth of
readings and notes. When you learn something new, the goal is to “lock it in” sooner rather
than later, and move it from short-term memory to long-term memory, where it can be
accessed when you need it (like at the end of the semester for your final exam or maybe years
from now). The next section will explore a variety of strategies that can be used to process
information more deeply and help improve retrieval.18

Memory Strategies19
Knowing What to Know
How can you decide what to study and what you need to know? The answer is to prioritize
what you’re trying to learn and memorize, rather than trying to tackle all of it. Below are
some strategies to help you do this:
 Think about concepts rather than facts: Most of the time instructors are concerned
about you learning about the key concepts in a subject or course rather than specific
facts.
 Take cues from your instructor: Pay attention to what your instructor writes on the
board, mentions repeatedly in class, or includes in study guides and handouts, they
are likely core concepts that you’ll want to focus on.
 Look for key terms: Textbooks will often put key terms in bold or italics.
 Use summaries: Read end of chapter summaries, or write your own, to check your
understanding of the main elements of the reading.
Transferring Information from Short-Term Memory to Long-Term Memory
In the previous discussion of how memory works, the importance of making intentional
efforts to transfer information from short-term to long-term memory was noted. Below are
some strategies to facilitate this process:
 Start reviewing new material immediately: Remember that people typically forget a
significant amount of new information within 24 hours of learning it.
 Study frequently for shorter periods of time: If you want to improve the odds of
recalling course material by the time of an exam or in future class, try reviewing it a
little bit every day.
Strengthening your Memory
How can you work to strengthen your overall memory? Some people have stronger
memories than others but memorizing new information takes work for anyone. Below are
some strategies that can aid memory:
 Rehearsal: One strategy is rehearsal, or the conscious repetition of information to be
remembered (Craik & Watkins, 1973). Academic learning comes with time and
practice, and at some point the skills become second nature.
 Incorporate visuals: Visual aids like note cards, concept maps, and highlighted
text are ways of making information stand out. These aids make the information to be
memorized seem more manageable and less daunting.
 Create mnemonics: Memory devices known as mnemonics can help you retain
information while only needing to remember a unique phrase or letter pattern that
stands out. They are especially useful when we want to recall larger bits of
information such as steps, stages, phases, and parts of a system (Bellezza, 1981).
There are different types of mnemonic devices:
19

Memory Strategies19
o Acronym: An acronym is a word formed by the first letter of each of the words
you want to remember. Such as HOMES for the Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario,
Michigan, Erie, and Superior)
o Acrostic: In an acrostic, you make a phrase of all the first letters of the words.
For example, if you need to remember the order of mathematical operations,
recalling the sentence “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally” will help you,
because the order of mathematical operations is Parentheses, Exponents,
Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.
o Jingles: Rhyming tunes that contain key words related to the concept, such as
“i before e, except after c” are jingles.
o Visual: Using a visual to help you remember is also useful. Such as the knuckle
mnemonic shown in the image below to help you remember the number of
days in each month. Months with 31 days are represented by the protruding
knuckles and shorter months fall in the spots between knuckles.

Figure 14.9 - You might use a mnemonic device to help you remember someone’s name, a mathematical
formula, or the six levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.20

Chunking: Another strategy is chunking, where you organize information into
manageable bits or chunks, such as turning a phone number you remember into
chunks.
Connect new information to old information: It’s easier to remember new
information if you can connect it to old information, a familiar frame of reference, or
a personal experience.

recommended amount, most people should aim for six to eight hours every night.

Adolescence (A Time of Transitions)
Cognitive growth and a new found sense of freedom and independence makes it both easier
and more difficult for teens when making choices and coping with upcoming transitions and life
decisions.

Academic Achievement, High School Dropouts, and Gap Years
As Adolescents grow older, they encounter age-related transition points that require them to
progress into a new role, such as go to college, take a year off or Gap Year, or start to work
towards a career. Educational expectations vary not only from culture to culture, but also from
class to class. While middle- or upper-class families may expect their daughter or son to attend
a four-year university after graduating from high school, other families may expect their child to
immediately begin working full-time, as many within their families have done before.21

Academic Achievement
Adolescents spend more waking time in school than in any other context (Eccles & Roeser,
2011). Academic achievement during adolescence is predicted by interpersonal (e.g., parental
engagement in adolescents’ education), intrapersonal (e.g., intrinsic motivation), and
institutional (e.g., school quality) factors. Academic achievement is important in its own right as
a marker of positive adjustment during adolescence but also because academic achievement
sets the stage for future educational and occupational opportunities. The most serious
consequence of school failure, particularly dropping out of school, is the high risk of
unemployment or underemployment in adulthood that follows. High achievement can set the
stage for college or future vocational training and opportunities.22

High School Dropouts
The status dropout rate refers to the percentage of 16 to 24 year-olds who are not enrolled in
school and do not have high school credentials (either a diploma or an equivalency credential
such as a General Educational Development [GED] certificate). The dropout rate is based on
sample surveys of the civilian, non- institutionalized population, which excludes persons in

prisons, persons in the military, and other persons not living in households. 23 The dropout rate
among high school students has declined from a rate of 9.7% in 2006, to 5.4% in 2017.24

Gap Year: How: different Societies Socialize Young Adults
Age transition points require socialization into new roles that can vary widely between
societies. For example, in the United Kingdom, when teens finish their secondary schooling (aka
high school in the United States), they often take a year “off” before entering college.
Frequently, they might take a job, travel, or find other ways to experience another culture.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, spent his gap year practicing survival skills in Belize,
teaching English in Chile, and working on a dairy farm in the United Kingdom (Prince of Wales
2012a). His brother, Prince Harry, advocated for AIDS orphans in Africa and worked as a
jackeroo (a novice ranch hand) in Australia (Prince of Wales 2012b).

Figure 14.10 – Prince William.25

Figure 14.11 – Prince Harry.26

In the United States, this life transition point is socialized quite differently, and taking a year off
is generally frowned upon. Instead, U.S. youth are encouraged to pick career paths by their
mid-teens, to select a college and a major by their late teens, and to have completed all
collegiate schooling or technical training for their career by their early twenties.
In other nations, this phase of the life course is tied into conscription, a term that describes
compulsory military service. Egypt, Switzerland, Turkey, and Singapore all have this system in
place. Youth in these nations (often only the males) are expected to undergo a number of
months or years of military training and service.27

Adolescents and Independence: Career, Work Experience, and Driving
Adolescents in the Workforce
Many adolescents work either summer jobs, or during the school year, or may work in lieu of
college. Holding a job may offer teenagers extra funds, provide the opportunity to learn new
skills, foster ideas about future careers, and perhaps shed light on the true value of money.
However, there are numerous concerns about teenagers working, especially during the school
year. Several studies have found that working more than 20 hours per week can lead to
declines in grades, a general disengagement from school (Staff, Schulenberg, & Bachman, 2010;
Lee & Staff, 2007; Marsh & Kleitman, 2005), an increase in substance abuse (Longest &
Shanahan, 2007), engaging in earlier sexual behavior, and pregnancy (Staff et al., 2011). Like
many employee groups, teens have seen a drop in the number of jobs. The summer jobs of
previous generations have been on a steady decline, according to the United States
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2016).

Figure 14.12 – How many hours and the reasons why this teen works, will influence the effects of her job.28

The Working Poor
A major concern in the United States is the rising number of young people who choose to work
rather than continue their education and are growing up or continuing to grow up in poverty.
Growing up poor or entering the workforce too soon, can cut off access to the education and
services people need to move out of poverty and into stable employment. Research states that
education was often a key to stability, and those raised in poverty are the ones least able to
find well-paying work, perpetuating a cycle. Those who work only part time, may it be teens or
whomever, are more likely to be classified as working poor than are those with full-time
employment; higher levels of education lead to less likelihood of being among the working

poor. 29 In 2017, the working poor included 6.9 million Americans, down from 7.6 million in
2011 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019).30

Teenage Drivers
Driving gives teens a sense of freedom and independence from their parents. It can also free up
time for parents as they are not shuttling teens to and from school, activities, or work. The
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that in 2014 young drivers (15
to 20 year-olds) accounted for 5.5% (11.7 million) of the total number of drivers (214 million) in
the US (National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA), 2016). However, almost 9% of all
drivers involved in fatal crashes that year were young drivers (NCSA, 2016), and according to
the National Center for Health Statistics (2014), motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause
of death for 15 to 20 year-olds. “In all motorized jurisdictions around the world, young,
inexperienced drivers have much higher crash rates than older, more experienced drivers”
(NCSA, 2016, p. 1).
The rate of fatal crashes is higher for young males than for young females, although for both
genders the rate was highest for the 15-20 year-old age group. For young males, the rate for
fatal crashes was approximately 46 per 100,000 drivers, compared to 20 per 100,000 drivers for
young females. The NHTSA (NCSA, 2016) reported that of the young drivers who were killed
and who had alcohol in their system, 81% had a blood alcohol count past what was considered
the legal limit. Fatal crashes involving alcohol use were higher among young men than young
women. The NHTSA also found that teens were less likely to use seat belt restraints if they were
driving under the influence of alcohol, and that restraint use decreased as the level of alcohol
intoxication increased.
AAA completed a study in 2014 that showed that the following are risk factors for accidents for
teen drivers:
 Following cars too closely
 Driving too fast for weather and road conditions
 Distraction from fellow passengers
 Distraction from cell phones
According to the NHTSA, 10% of drivers aged 15 to 19 years involved in fatal crashes were
reported to be distracted at the time of the crash; the highest figure for any age group (NCSA,
2016). Distraction coupled with inexperience has been found to greatly increase the risk of an
accident (Klauer et al., 2014).
The NHTSA did find that the number of accidents has been on a decline since 2005. They
attribute this to greater driver training, more social awareness to the challenges of driving for

teenagers, and to changes in laws restricting the drinking age. The NHTSA estimates that the
raising of the legal drinking age to 21 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia has saved
30,323 lives since 1975.31

Figure 14.13 – This teen needs to have solid driver training and awareness of driving challenges.32

Wisdom and Risk-Taking
Whether it is a sense heightened of ability (we’ve learned a lot about the egocentrism, personal
fable, imaginary audience, or the lack of development of prefrontal cortex), or just poor
decision making, many teens tend to take unnecessary risks. Wisdom, or the capacity for
insight and judgment that is developed through experience, increases between the ages of 14
and 25, and increases with maturity, life experiences, and cognitive development. Wisdom
increases gradually and is not the same as intelligence, and adolescents do not improve
substantially on IQ tests since their scores are relative to others in their age group, as everyone
matures at approximately the same rate. Adolescents must be monitored because they are
more likely to take risks than adults. The behavioral decision-making theory proposes that
adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action.
However, adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than
do adults. Scaffolding adolescents until they show consistent and appropriate judgment will
likely allow for fewer negative consequences.33

Introduction
Adolescents continue to refine their sense of self as they relate to others. Adolescent’s main
questions are “Who am I?” and “Who do I want to be?” Some adolescents adopt the values and
roles that their parents expect of them. Other teens develop identities that align more with the
peer groups rather than their parents’ expectations. This is common as adolescents work to
form their identities. They pull away from their parents and the peer group becomes very
important (Shanahan, McHale, Osgood, & Crouter, 2007). Despite spending less time with their
parents, most teens report positive feelings toward them (Moore, Guzman, Hair, Lippman, &
Garrett, 2004). Warm and healthy parent-child relationships have been associated with positive
outcomes for the adolescent, such as better grades and fewer school behavior problems, in the
United States as well as in other countries (Hair et al., 2005).1

Erik Erikson – Theory of Psychosocial Development
Erikson proposed that each period of life has a unique challenge or crisis that a person must
face. This is referred to as a psychosocial development. According to Erikson, successful
development involves dealing with and resolving the goals and demands of each of these crises
in a positive way. These crises are usually called stages, although that is not the term Erikson
used. If a person does not resolve a crisis successfully, it may hinder their ability to deal with
later crises. For example, an individual who does not develop a clear sense of purpose and
identity (Erikson’s fifth crisis - Identity vs. Role Confusion) may become self-absorbed and
stagnate rather than working toward the betterment of others (Erikson’s seventh crisis Generativity vs. Stagnation). However, most individuals are able to successfully complete the
eight crises of his theory.3

Identity vs. Role Confusion
Identity vs. Role Confusion is a major stage of development where the child has to learn the
roles he will occupy as an adult. In adolescence, children (ages 12–18) face the task of identity
vs. role confusion. Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of fidelity. Fidelity involves being
able to commit one's self to others on the basis of accepting others, even when there may be
ideological differences. According to Erikson, an adolescent’s main task is developing a sense of
self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as “Who am I?” and “What do I want to do with
my life?” Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see which ones fit;
they explore various roles and ideas, set goals, and attempt to discover their “adult” selves.
Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to
remain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people’s perspectives.
When adolescents are apathetic, do not make a conscious search for identity, or are pressured
to conform to their parents’ ideas for the future, they may develop a weak sense of self and
experience role confusion. They will be unsure of their identity and confused about the future.
Teenagers who struggle to adopt a positive role will likely struggle to “find” themselves as
adults.4
Erikson saw this as a period of confusion and experimentation regarding identity and how one
navigates along life’s path. During adolescence, we experience psychological moratorium,
where teens put their current identity on hold while they explore their options for identity. The
culmination of this exploration is a more coherent view of oneself. Those who are unsuccessful
at resolving this stage may either withdraw further into social isolation or become lost in the
crowd. However, more recent research suggests, that few leave this age period with identity
achievement, and that most identity formation occurs during young adulthood (Côtè, 2006).5

James Marcia – Theory of Identity Development
One approach to assessing identity development was proposed by James Marcia. In his
approach, adolescents are asking questions regarding their exploration of and commitment to
issues related to occupation, politics, religion, and sexual behavior. Studies assessing how teens
pass through Marcia’s stages show that although most teens eventually succeed in developing a
stable identity, the path to it is not always easy and there are many routes that can be taken.
Some teens may simply adopt the beliefs of their parents or the first role that is offered to
them, perhaps at the expense of searching for other more promising possibilities (foreclosure
status). Other teens may spend years trying on different possible identities (moratorium status)
before finally choosing one.6
Marcia identified four identity statuses that represent the four possible combinations of the
dimension of commitment and exploration.7

Table 15.1 Identity Status
Description8

Identity Status
Identity-Diffusion status is a
status that characterizes
those who have neither
explored the options, nor
made a commitment to an
identity.

The individual does not have firm commitments regarding
the issues in question and is not making progress toward
them. Those who persist in this identity may drift aimlessly
with little connection to those around them or have little
sense of purpose in life.

Identity-Foreclosure status is
the status for those who have
made a commitment to an
identity without having
explored the options.

The individual has not engaged in any identity
experimentation and has established an identity based on
the choices or values of others. Some parents may make
these decisions for their children and do not grant the teen
the opportunity to make choices. In other instances, teens
may strongly identify with parents and others in their life and
wish to follow in their footsteps.

Identity-Moratorium status
is a status that describes
those who are exploring in an
attempt to establish an

The individual is exploring various choices but has not yet
made a clear commitment to any of them. This can be an
anxious and emotionally tense time period as the adolescent
experiments with different roles and explores various beliefs.

Identity Status
identity but have yet to have
made any commitment.
Identity-Achievement status
refers to the status for those
who, after exploration, have
made a commitment.

Nothing is certain and there are many questions, but few
answers.
The individual has attained a coherent and committed
identity based on personal decisions. This is a long process
and is not often achieved by the end of adolescence

The least mature status, and one common in many children, is identity diffusion. During high
school and the college years, teens and young adults move from identity diffusion and
foreclosure toward moratorium and achievement. The biggest gains in the development of
identity are in college, as college students are exposed to a greater variety of career choices,
lifestyles, and beliefs. This is likely to spur on questions regarding identity. A great deal of the
identity work we do in adolescence and young adulthood is about values and goals, as we strive
to articulate a personal vision or dream for what we hope to accomplish in the future
(McAdams, 2013).9
To help them work through the process of developing an identity, teenagers may try out
different identities in different social situations. They may maintain one identity at home and a
different type of persona when they are with their peers. Eventually, most teenagers do
integrate the different possibilities into a single self-concept and a comfortable sense of
identity (identity-achievement status). For teenagers, the peer group provides valuable
information about the self-concept. For instance, in response to the question “What were you
like as a teenager? (e.g., cool, nerdy, awkward?),” posed on the website Answerbag, one
teenager replied in this way:
I’m still a teenager now, but from 8th-9th grade I didn’t really know what I wanted at all.
I was smart, so I hung out with the nerdy kids. I still do; my friends mean the world to
me. But in the middle of 8th grade I started hanging out with which you may call the
“cool” kids…and I also hung out with some stoners, just for variety. I pierced various

is derived from one’s group memberships. Adolescents define their social identities according

Development of Identity and Self Concept: Who am I?
Developmental psychologists have researched several different areas of identity development
for adolescence and some of the main areas include:

Religious Identity
The religious views of teens are often similar to that of their families (Kim- Spoon, Longo, &
McCullough, 2012). Most teens may question specific customs, practices, or ideas in the faith of
their parents, but few completely reject the religion of their families.

Political Identity
The political ideology of teens is also influenced by their parents’ political beliefs. A new trend
in the 21st century is a decrease in party affiliation among adults. Many adults do not align
themselves with either the democratic or republican party, but view themselves as more of an
“independent”. Their teenage children are often following suit or becoming more apolitical
(Côtè, 2006).

Vocational Identity
While adolescents in earlier generations envisioned themselves as working in a particular job,
and often worked as an apprentice or part-time, this is rarely the case today. Vocational
identity takes longer to develop, as most of today’s occupations require specific skills and
knowledge that will require additional education or are acquired on the job itself. In addition,
many of the jobs held by teens are not in professions that most teens will seek as adults.

Gender Identity
This is also becoming an increasingly prolonged task as attitudes and norms regarding gender
keep changing. The roles appropriate for males and females are evolving. Some teens may
foreclose on a gender identity as a way of dealing with this uncertainty, and they may adopt
more stereotypic male or female roles (Sinclair & Carlsson, 2013). We will be looking more
closely at gender identity later in the chapter.19

Self-Concept and Self-Esteem
In adolescence, teens continue to develop their self-concept. Their ability to think of the
possibilities and to reason more abstractly may explain the further differentiation of the self
during adolescence. However, the teen’s understanding of self is often full of contradictions.
Young teens may see themselves as outgoing but also withdrawn, happy yet often moody, and
both smart and completely clueless (Harter, 2012). These contradictions, along with the teen’s
growing recognition that their personality and behavior seem to change depending on who
they are with or where they are, can lead the young teen to feel like a fraud. With their parents
they may seem angrier and sullen, with their friends they are more outgoing and goofy, and at
work they are quiet and cautious. “Which one is really me?” may be the refrain of the young
teenager. Harter (2012) found that adolescents emphasize traits such as being friendly and
considerate more than do children, highlighting their increasing concern about how others may
see them. Harter also found that older teens add values and moral standards to their selfdescriptions.

Figure 15.9 – An adolescent’s understanding of their
self is often full of contradictions.20

Figure 15.10 – Adolescents are more likely to
emphasize values in their self-descriptions.21

As self-concept develops, so does self-esteem. In addition to the academic, social, appearance,
and physical/athletic dimensions of self-esteem in middle and late childhood, teens also add
perceptions of their competency in romantic relationships, on the job, and in close friendships
(Harter, 2006). Self-esteem often decreases when children transition from one school setting to
another, such as shifting from elementary to middle school, or junior high to high school (Ryan,
Shim, & Makara, 2013). These decreases are usually temporary, unless there are additional
stressors such as parental conflict, or other family disruptions (De Wit, Karioja, Rye, & Shain,
2011). Self-esteem rises from mid to late adolescence for most teenagers, especially if they feel
confident in their peer relationships, their appearance, and athletic abilities (Birkeland,
Melkivik, Holsen, & Wold, 2012).

Development of Gender Identity
From birth, children are assigned a gender and are socialized to conform to certain gender roles
based on their biological sex. “Sex,” refers to physical or physiological differences between
males, females, and intersex persons, including both their primary and secondary sex
characteristics. “Gender,” on the other hand, refers to social or cultural distinctions associated
with a given sex.
When babies are born, they are assigned a gender based on their biological sex—male babies
are assigned as boys, female babies are assigned as girls, and intersex babies are born with
sex characteristics that do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies, and are
usually relegated into one gender category or another. Scholars generally regard gender as
a social construct, meaning that it doesn’t exist naturally but is instead a concept that is
created by cultural and societal norms. From birth, children are socialized to conform to certain
gender roles based on their biological sex and the gender to which they are assigned. 22

A person’s subjective experience of their own gender and how it develops, or gender identity,
is a topic of much debate. It is the extent to which one identifies with a particular gender; it is a
person’s individual sense and subjective experience of being a man, a woman, or other gender.
It is often shaped early in life and consists primarily of the acceptance (or non-acceptance) of
one’s membership into a gender category. In most societies, there is a basic division between
gender attributes assigned to males and females. In all societies, however, some individuals do
not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex.
Those that identify with the gender that corresponds to the sex assigned to them at birth (for
example, they are assigned female at birth and continue to identify as a girl, and later a woman)
are called cisgender. In many Western cultures, individuals who identify with a gender that is
different from their biological sex (for example, they are assigned female at birth but feel
inwardly that they are a boy or a gender other than a girl) are called transgender. Some
transgender individuals, if they have access to resources and medical care, choose to alter their
bodies through medical interventions such as surgery and hormonal therapy so that their
physical being is better aligned with their gender identity.

Figure 15.11 - This person identifies as genderqueer.23

Recent terms such as “genderqueer,” “genderfluid,” “gender variant,” “androgynous,”
“agender,” and “gender nonconforming” are used by individuals who do not identify within the
gender binary as either a man or a woman. Instead they identify as existing somewhere along a
spectrum or continuum of genders, or outside of the spectrum altogether, often in a way that is
continuously evolving.

The Gender Continuum
Viewing gender as a continuum allows us to perceive the rich diversity of genders, from transand cisgender to gender queer and agender. Most Western societies operate on the idea that
gender is a binary, that there are essentially only two genders (men and women) based on two
sexes (male and female), and that everyone must fit one or the other. This social dichotomy
enforces conformance to the ideals of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of gender and
sex—gender identity, gender expression, and biological sex.
According to supporters of queer theory, gender identity is not a rigid or static identity but can
continue to evolve and change over time. Queer theory developed in response to the perceived
limitations of the way in which identities are thought to become consolidated or stabilized (for
instance, gay or straight), and theorists constructed queerness in an attempt to resist this. In
this way, the theory attempts to maintain a critique rather than define a specific identity. While
“queer” defies a simple definition, the term is often used to convey an identity that is not rigidly
developed but is instead fluid and changing.24

In 2012, Sam Killerman created the Genderbread Person as an infographic to break down
gender identity, gender expression, biological sex, and sexual orientation.25 In 2018, he updated
it to version 2.0 to be more accurate, and inclusive.26

orientation.27

Gender Pronouns
Pronouns are a part of language used to refer to someone or something without using proper
nouns. In standard English, some singular third-person pronouns are "he" and "she," which
are usually seen as gender-specific pronouns, referring to a man and a woman, respectively. A
gender-neutral pronoun or gender-inclusive pronoun is one that gives no implications about
gender, and could be used for someone of any gender.
Some languages only have gender-neutral pronouns, whereas other languages have difficulty
establishing any that aren't gender-specific. People with non-binary gender identities often
choose new third-person pronouns for themselves as part of their transition. They often
choose gender-neutral pronouns so that others won't see them as female or male.28
Here is a table based on the Rainbow Coalition of Yellowknife’s Handy Guide to Pronouns:

Factors that Influence Gender Identity
Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have
been suggested as influencing its development. Biological factors that may influence gender
identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels and genetic makeup. Social factors include
ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other
influential people in a child’s life. According to social-learning theory, children develop their
gender identity through observing and imitating the gender-linked behaviors of others; they are
then “rewarded” for imitating the behaviors of people of the same gender and “punished” for
imitating the behaviors of another gender. For example, male children will often be rewarded
for imitating their father’s love of baseball but punished or redirected in some way if they
imitate their older sister’s love of dolls. Children are shaped and molded by the people
surrounding them, who they try to imitate and follow.

Gender Roles
The term “gender role” refers to society’s concept of how men and women are expected to act.
As we grow, we learn how to behave from those around us. In this socialization process,
children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex. The term
“gender role” refers to society’s concept of how men and women are expected to act and
behave. Gender roles are based on norms, or standards, created by society. In American
culture, masculine roles have traditionally been associated with strength, aggression, and
dominance, while feminine roles have traditionally been associated with passivity, nurturing,
and subordination.

Gender Socialization
The socialization process in which children learn these gender roles begins at birth. Today, our
society is quick to outfit male infants in blue and girls in pink, even applying these color-coded
gender labels while a baby is in the womb. It is interesting to note that these color associations
with gender have not always been what they are today. Up until the beginning of the 20th
century, pink was actually more associated with boys, while blue was more associated with
girls—illustrating how socially constructed these associations really are.

Gender socialization occurs through four major agents: family, education, peer groups, and
mass media. Each agent reinforces gender roles by creating and maintaining normative
expectations for gender-specific behavior. Exposure also occurs through secondary agents, such
as religion and the workplace. Repeated exposure to these agents over time leads people into a
false sense that they are acting naturally based on their gender rather than following a socially
constructed role.

Gender Stereotypes, Sexism, and Gender-Role Enforcement
The attitudes and expectations surrounding gender roles are not typically based on any
inherent or natural gender differences, but on gender stereotypes, or oversimplified notions
about the attitudes, traits, and behavior patterns of males and females. We engage in gender
stereotyping when we do things like making the assumption that a teenage babysitter is
female.
While it is somewhat acceptable for women to take on a narrow range of masculine
characteristics without repercussions (such as dressing in traditionally male clothing), men are
rarely able to take on more feminine characteristics (such as wearing skirts) without the risk of
harassment or violence. This threat of punishment for stepping outside of gender norms is
especially true for those who do not identify as male or female.

Figure 15.13 – Would girls likely pose this way for an image? What does this say about gender stereotypes?30

Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism, or the prejudiced beliefs that value males over
females. Common forms of sexism in modern society include gender-role expectations, such as
expecting women to be the caretakers of the household. Sexism also includes people’s
expectations of how members of a gender group should behave. For example, girls and women
are expected to be friendly, passive, and nurturing; when she behaves in an unfriendly or
assertive manner, she may be disliked or perceived as aggressive because she has violated a

gender role (Rudman, 1998). In contrast, a boy or man behaving in a similarly unfriendly or
assertive way might be perceived as strong or even gain respect in some circumstances.31

Socialization Agents During Adolescence
Adolescence is a crucial period in social development, research shows there are four main types
of relationships that influence an adolescent: parents, peers, community, and society.

Parents and Teens: Autonomy and Attachment
While most adolescents get along with their parents, they do spend less time with them
(Smetana, 2011). This decrease in the time spent with families may be a reflection of a
teenager’s greater desire for independence or autonomy. It can be difficult for many parents to
deal with this desire for autonomy. However, it is normal for teenagers to increasingly distance
themselves and establish relationships outside of their families in preparation for adulthood.
Children in middle and late childhood are increasingly given greater freedom regarding basic
decision making. This continues in adolescence, as teens demand more and more control over
the decisions that affect their daily lives. Teens believe they should manage the areas that
parents previously had considerable control over, which can increase tension between parents
and their teenagers. Their arguments often center on issues of a power struggle or conflict in
areas such as chores, homework, curfew, dating, personal appearance, and the right to privacy.

Figure 15.14 – Teenagers report more conflicts with their mothers. 32

As teens grow older, more compromise is reached between parents and teenagers (Smetana,
2011). Teens report more conflict with their mothers, as many mothers believe they should still
have some control over many of these areas, yet often report their mothers to be more
encouraging and supportive (Costigan, Cauce, & Etchison, 2007). Parents are more controlling

of daughters, especially early maturing girls, than they are sons (Caspi, Lynam, Moffitt, & Silva,
1993). In addition, culture and ethnicity also play a role in how restrictive parents are with the
daily lives of their children (Chen, Vansteenkiste, Beyers, Soensens, & Van Petegem, 2013).33
Having supportive, less conflict ridden relationships with parents also benefits teenagers.
Research on attachment in adolescence finds that teens who are still securely attached to their
parents have less emotional problems (Rawatlal, Kliewer & Pillay, 2015), are less likely to
engage in drug abuse and other criminal behaviors (Meeus, Branje & Overbeek, 2004), and
have more positive peer relationships (Shomaker & Furman, 2009). This means that both
parents and teenagers need to strike a balance between autonomy, while still maintaining close
and caring familial relationships.34

The Parent-Child Relationship
The relationship with parents may be a mitigating factor of the negative influence by peers.
Communicating family rules and parental style have been inversely associated to substance,
alcohol, and tobacco consumption during adolescence. This influence is essential for
adolescents’ development up to adulthood. Communication between parents and adolescents
emerges as a protective factor for alcohol, tobacco, and substance use (Newman, Harrison &
Dashiff, 2008).
Sen (2010) observed that family meals could lead to creating a closer relation between parents
and adolescents, by strengthening a positive relationship and avoiding certain risk behaviors,
such as substance use amongst girls and alcohol consumption, physical violence, and robberies,
amongst boys. These differences between genders may be due to a greater importance that
girls attribute to family activities but they do not reveal that boys are indifferent to them, only
that the relation between genders may differ. Huebner and Howell (2003) verified that parental
monitoring and communication with parents protected adolescents of both genders from being
involved in risk behaviors.

Parental monitoring can be defined as parents’ knowledge about their children’s activities, who
they hang out with and what they do. It has been associated to protection of various risk
behaviors throughout adolescence, such as substance use or sexual behaviors. The greater the
parental monitoring, the lower the adolescents’ involvement in risk behavior. It may vary
according to age, gender or ethnicity and it generally decreases with age (Westling, Andrews,
Hampson & Peterson, 2008).36

Relationships with Peers and Peer Groups
Peer Relationships
In addition, peers also serve as an important source of social support and companionship
during adolescence. As children become adolescents, they usually begin spending more time
with their peers and less time with their families, and these peer interactions are increasingly
unsupervised by adults. The level of influence that peers can have over an adolescent makes
these relationships particularly important in their personal development. Adolescents with
positive peer relationships are happier and better adjusted than those who are socially isolated
or have conflictual peer relationships.
Adolescents’ notions of friendship increasingly focus on intimate exchanges of thoughts and
feelings, which are important to forming friendships; these high quality friendships may
enhance a child’s development regardless of the particular characteristics of those friends. In
addition, peers also serve as an important source of social support and companionship during
adolescence.
The peer group may serve as a model and influence behaviors and attitudes and also provide
easy access, encouragement and an appropriate social setting for consumption (Glaser, Shelton
& Bree, 2010). Social Learning Theory suggests that it is not necessary for adolescents to
observe a given behavior and adopt it; it is sufficient to perceive that the peer group accepts it,
in order to be able to opt for similar behaviors (Petraitis, Flay & Miller, 1995).37
Peers can serve both positive and negative functions during adolescence. Relationships with
peers are valuable opportunities for adolescents to practice their social and conflict resolution
skills. But negative peer pressure can lead adolescents to make riskier decisions or engage in
more problematic behavior than they would alone or in the presence of their family. One of the
most widely studied aspects of adolescent peer influence is known as deviant peer contagion
(Dishion & Tipsord, 2011), which is the process by which peers reinforce problem behavior by
laughing or showing other signs of approval that then increase the likelihood of future problem
behavior.38

Peers may strongly determine preference in the way of dressing, speaking, using illicit
substances, sexual behavior, adopting and accepting violence, adopting criminal and anti-social
behaviors, and in many other areas of the adolescent’s life (Padilla, Walker & Bean, 2009;
Tomé, Matos & Diniz, 2008). An example of this is that the main motives for alcohol
consumption given by adolescents are related to social events, which usually take place in the
company of friends, namely: drinking makes holidays more fun, it facilitates approaching
others, it helps relaxing or facilitates sharing experiences and feelings (Kuntsche, Knibbe, Gmel
& Engels, 2005). Also, mimicking risk behaviors may be greater when consumption begins in the
context of a social event (Larsen, Engels, Souren, Granic & Overbeek, 2010).

Figure 15.16 - Adolescent boys drinking at a party.39

On the other hand, having friends allows to share experiences and feelings and to learn how to
solve conflicts. Not having friends, on the other hand, leads to social isolation and limited social
contacts, as there are fewer opportunities to develop new relations and social interactional
skills.
Friendship is also positively associated to psychological well-being (Ueno, 2004), Stronger
friendships may provide adolescents with an appropriate environment to development in a
healthy way and to achieve good academic results. Adolescents with reciprocal friendships
mention high levels of feelings of belonging in school; at the same time, reciprocity and feelings
of belonging have positive effects in academic results (Vaquera & Kao, 2008).
School is a setting where interpersonal relations are promoted, which are important for
youngsters’ personal and social development (Ruini et al., 2009); it is responsible for the
transmission of behavioral norms and standards and it represents an essential role in the
adolescent’s socialization process. The school is able to gather different peer communities and
to promote self-esteem and a harmonious development between adolescents, which makes it a
privileged space for meetings and interactions (Baptista, Tomé, Matos, Gaspar & Cruz, 2008).
Adolescents spend a great part of their time at school, which also makes it a privileged context
for involvement in or protection from risk behaviors (Piko & Kovács, 2010). Camacho, Tomé,
Matos, Gamito and Diniz (2010) confirmed that adolescents who like school were those that
39

399 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

more often were part of a peer group without involvement in risk behaviors; while those that
mentioned they did not have any friends reported that they liked school less and those in
conflict with their peers had more negative health outcomes.

Figure 15.17 - These teens are at a concert together.40

Despite the positive influence of the peer group during adolescence, the higher the
adolescent’s autonomy from the peer group, the higher their resilience against its influence.
This resilience seems to increase with age, which may mean that it is associated with
youngsters’ maturity; and girls emerge in several studies as more resilient than boys (Sumter,
Bokhorst, Steinberg & Westenberg, 2009).
Another factor that may be found in the influence of the peer group is the type of friendship,
which adolescents maintain with their peer group: if friends are close they have a greater
influence on the other’s behaviors (Glaser, Shelton & Bree, 2010). When the friendship is
perceived as reciprocal and of quality, exerts greater influence (Mercken, Snijders, Steglich,
Vartiainen & Vries, 2010). Another factor, which has been identified as a possible way of
decreasing peer influence, is assertive refusal. Adolescents that are able to maintain an
assertive refusal are less susceptible to the group’s influence (Glaser, Shelton & Bree, 2010).
These are only some variables identified as possible factors decreasing peer influence. 41

Peers in Groups
During adolescence, it is common to have friends of the opposite sex much more than in
childhood, peer groups evolve from primarily single-sex to mixed-sex. Teens within a peer
group tend to be similar to one another in behavior and attitudes, which has been explained as
a function of homophily, that is, adolescents who are similar to one another choose to spend
time together in a “birds of a feather flock together” way. Adolescents who spend time
together also shape each other’s behavior.

Crowds are an emerging level of peer relationships in adolescence. In contrast to friendships,
which are reciprocal dyadic relationships, and cliques, which refer to groups of individuals who
interact frequently, crowds are characterized by shared reputations or images (who people
think they are). Crowds refer to different collections of people, like the “theater kids” or the
“environmentalists.” In a way, they are kind of like clothing brands that label the people
associated with that crowd.42

Community, Society, and Culture
There are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture
than in human biology or cognitive structures. Culture is learned and socially shared, and it
affects all aspects of an individual’s life. Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and beliefsystem development, for instance, are all likely to vary based on culture. Furthermore, many
distinguishing characteristics of an individual (such as dress, employment, recreation, and
language) are all products of culture.

Many factors that shape adolescent development vary by culture. For instance, the degree to
which adolescents are perceived as autonomous, or independent beings varies widely in
different cultures, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. The lifestyle of
an adolescent in a given culture is also profoundly shaped by the roles and responsibilities he or
she is expected to assume. The extent to which an adolescent is expected to share family
responsibilities, for example, is one large determining factor in normative adolescent behavior.
Adolescents in certain cultures are expected to contribute significantly to household chores and
responsibilities, while others are given more freedom or come from families with more
privilege where responsibilities are fewer. Differences between families in the distribution of
financial responsibilities or provision of allowance may reflect various socioeconomic
backgrounds, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values.
Adolescents begin to develop unique belief systems through their interaction with social,
familial, and cultural environments. These belief systems encompass everything from religion
and spirituality to gender, sexuality, work ethics, and politics. The range of attitudes that a
culture embraces on a particular topic affects the beliefs, lifestyles, and perceptions of its
adolescents, and can have both positive and negative impacts on their development.

Development of Ethnic Identity
Adolescent development does not necessarily follow the same pathway for all individuals.
Certain features of adolescence, particularly with respect to biological changes associated with
puberty and cognitive changes associated with brain development, are relatively universal. But
other features of adolescence depend largely on circumstances that are more environmentally
variable. For example, adolescents growing up in one country might have different
opportunities for risk taking than adolescents in a different country, and supports and sanctions
for different behaviors in adolescence depend on laws and values that might be specific to
where adolescents live.

Figure 15.21 – These values of these adolescent girls’ families and communities will influence their development.46

Different cultural norms regarding family and peer relationships shape adolescents’ experiences
in these domains. For example, in some countries, adolescents’ parents are expected to remain

in control over major decisions, whereas in other countries, adolescents are expected to begin
sharing in or taking control of decision making . Even within the same country, adolescents’
gender, ethnicity, immigrant status, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and
personality can shape both how adolescents behave and how others respond to them, creating
diverse developmental contexts for different adolescents.47
Ethnic Identity refers to how people come to terms with who they are based on their ethnic or
racial ancestry. “The task of ethnic identity formation involves sorting out and resolving positive
and negative feelings and attitudes about one’s own ethnic group and about other groups and
identifying one’s place in relation to both” (Phinney, 2006, p. 119). When groups differ in status
in a culture—those from the non-dominant group have to be cognizant of the customs and
values of those from the dominant culture. The reverse is rarely the case. This makes ethnic
identity far less important for members of the dominant culture.
In the United States, those of European ancestry engage in less exploration of ethnic identity,
than do those of non-European ancestry (Phinney, 1989). However, according to the U.S.
Census (2012) more than 40% of Americans under the age of 18 are from ethnic minorities. For
many ethnic minority teens, discovering one’s ethnic identity is an important part of identity
formation. Phinney’s model of ethnic identity formation is based on Erikson and Marcia’s model
of identity formation (Phinney, 1990; Syed & Juang, 2014). Through the process of exploration
and commitment, individual’s come to understand and create an ethnic identity.

Phinney’s Three Stages or Statuses of Ethnic Identity
Phinney’s model of ethnic identity formation is based on Erikson’s and Marcia’s model of
identity formation (Phinney, 1990; Syed & Juang, 2014). Through the process of exploration and
commitment, individual’s come to understand and create an ethic identity. Phinney suggests
three stages or statuses with regard to ethnic identity:

Stage 1:
Unexamined
Ethnic Identity

Stage 2: Ethnic
Identity Search

Descriptions
Adolescents and adults who have not been exposed to ethnic identity
issues may be in the first stage, unexamined ethnic identity. This is often
characterized with a preference for the dominant culture, or where the
individual has given little thought to the question of their ethnic heritage.
This is similar to diffusion in Marcia’s model of identity. Included in this
group are also those who have adopted the ethnicity of their parents and
other family members with little thought about the issues themselves,
similar to Marcia’s foreclosure status (Phinney, 1990).
Adolescents and adults who are exploring the customs, culture, and
history of their ethnic group are in the ethnic identity search stage, similar

to Marcia’s moratorium status (Phinney, 1990). Often some event
“awakens” a teen or adult to their ethnic group; either a personal
experience with prejudice, a highly profiled case in the media, or even a
more positive event that recognizes the contribution of someone from
the individual’s ethnic group. Teens and adults in this stage will immerse
themselves in their ethnic culture. For some, “it may lead to a rejection of
the values of the dominant culture” (Phinney, 1990, p. 503).
Those who have actively explored their culture are likely to have a deeper
appreciation and understanding of their ethnic heritage, leading to
progress toward an achieved ethnic identity (Phinney, 1990). An achieved
ethnic identity does not necessarily imply that the individual is highly
involved in the customs and values of their ethnic culture. One can be
confident in their ethnic identity without wanting to maintain the
language or other customs.

The development of ethnic identity takes time, with about 25% of tenth graders from ethnic
minority backgrounds having explored and resolved the issues (Phinney, 1989). The more
ethnically homogeneous the high school, the less identity exploration and achievement
(Umana-Taylor, 2003). Moreover, even in more ethnically diverse high schools, teens tend to
spend more time with their own group, reducing exposure to other ethnicities. This may explain
why, for many, college becomes the time of ethnic identity exploration. “[The] transition to
college may serve as a consciousness-raising experience that triggers exploration” (Syed &
Azmitia, 2009, p. 618).
It is also important to note that those who do achieve ethnic identity may periodically
reexamine the issues of ethnicity. This cycling between exploration and achievement is
common not only for ethnic identity formation, but in other aspects of identity development
(Grotevant, 1987) and is referred to (from Marcia’s Theory: Stages of Identity) as MAMA cycling
or moving back and forth between moratorium and achievement.48

Bicultural/Multiracial Identity
Ethnic minorities must wrestle with the question of how, and to what extent, they will identify
with the culture of their surroundings, thus society and with the culture of their family. Phinney
(2006) suggests that people may handle it in different ways. Some may keep the identities
separate, others may combine them in some way, while others may reject some of them.
Bicultural identity means individuals sees themselves as part of both the ethnic minority group
and the larger society. Those who are multiracial, that is whose parents come from two or
more ethnic or racial groups, have a more challenging task. In some cases their appearance may
be ambiguous. This can lead to others constantly asking them to categorize themselves.

accomplish in those who are not monoracial or a single ethnicity.49

Media: Influences on Teens
Media is another agent of socialization that influences our political views; our tastes in popular
culture; our views of women, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community; and many other
beliefs and practices. In an ongoing controversy, the media is often blamed for youth violence
and many other of society’s ills. The average child sees thousands of acts of violence on
television and in the movies before reaching young adulthood. Rap lyrics often seemingly extol
ugly violence, including violence against women. Commercials can greatly influence our choice
of soda, shoes, and countless other products. The mass media may also reinforce racial and
gender stereotypes, including the belief that women are sex objects and suitable targets of
male violence. In the General Social Survey (GSS), about 28% of respondents said that they
watch four or more hours of television every day, while another 46% watch 2-3 hours daily (see
"Average Number of Hours of Television Watched Daily"). The media certainly are an important
source of socialization that was unimaginable a half-century ago.

Figure 15.23 – Daily television viewing time.51

As the media socializes children, adolescents, and even adults, a key question is the extent to
which media violence causes violence in our society. Studies consistently uncover a strong
correlation between watching violent television shows and movies and committing violence.
However, this does not necessarily mean that watching the violence actually causes violent
behavior: perhaps people watch violence because they are already interested in it and perhaps
even committing it. Scholars continue to debate the effect of media violence on youth violence.
In a free society, this question is especially important, as the belief in this effect has prompted
calls for monitoring the media and the banning of certain acts of violence. Civil libertarians
argue that such calls smack of censorship that violates the First Amendment to the
Constitution, while others argue that they fall within the First Amendment and would make for
a safer society. Certainly the concern and debate over mass media violence will continue for
years to come.52

Development of Sexual Identity
Dating and Romantic Relationships
Adolescence is the developmental period during which romantic relationships typically first
emerge. By the end of adolescence, most American teens have dated others and have had at
least one romantic relationship (Dolgin, 2011). However, culture does play a role as Asian
Americans and Latinas are less likely to date than other ethnic groups (Connolly, Craig,
Goldberg, & Pepler, 2004). Dating serves many purposes for teens, including having fun,
companionship, status, socialization, intimacy, sexual experimentation, and partner selection
for those in late adolescence (Dolgin, 2011). There are several stages in the dating process,
beginning with engaging in mixed-sex group activities in early adolescence (Dolgin, 2011).

Table 15.4 - Romantic Relationships in Adolescence
Age

Relationship

Early Adolescence

Romantic relationships often form in the context of these mixed-sex
peer groups (Connolly, Furman, & Konarski, 2000). Interacting in
mixed-sex groups is easier for teens as they are among a supportive
group of friends, can observe others interacting, and are kept safe
from becoming intimate too soon.

Middle Adolescence

By middle adolescence, teens are engaging in brief, casual dating, or
in group dating with other couples (Dolgin, 2011).

Late Adolescence

In late adolescence, dating involves exclusive, intense relationships
that are short-lived or are long-term committed partnerships, either
way their importance should not be minimized. Adolescents spend a
great deal of time focused on romantic relationships or lack thereof.
Their positive and negative emotions are tied to this intense interest
more than they are to friendships, family relationships, or school
(Furman & Shaffer, 2003).

Furthermore, romantic relationships are centrally connected to adolescents’ emerging
sexuality. Parents, policymakers, and researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to
adolescents’ sexuality, in large part because of concerns related to sexual intercourse,
contraception, and preventing teen pregnancies. However, sexuality involves more than this
narrow focus, for example, adolescence is often when individuals who are lesbian, gay,
bisexual, or transgender come to understand and define what their sexual identity is (Russell,
Clarke, & Clary, 2009). Thus, romantic relationships are a domain in which adolescents
experiment with new behaviors and identities.53

Violence by Someone You Know
Violence can be committed against someone that the victim knows well, referred to as an
intimate, in many ways: an intimate can hit with their fists, slap with an open hand, throw an
object, push or shove, or use or threaten to use a weapon. While we can never be certain of
the exact number of intimates that are attacked, the U.S. Department of Justice estimates
from its National Crime Victimization Survey that almost 600,000 acts of violence (2008 data)
are committed annually by one intimate against another intimate. 55
According to a fact sheet from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence that
compiled the results of several studies:
 In 2013, 35% of 10th graders reported that they had been physically or verbally
abused and 31% reported having perpetrated such abuse
 In 2014, 10% of teenage students in dating relationships reported being coerced into
sexual intercourse in the previous year
 In 2015, 20.9% of female and 13.4% of male high school students reported being
physically or sexually assaulted by a dating partner
 But only 33% of teenage dating abuse victims reported having ever told anyone about
it (according to a 2005 study) 56
A 2010 report by the CDC shows the larger pictures of intimate partner violence
 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 women have been victims of some form of physical violence
by an intimate partner in their lifetime
 1 in 7 women and 1 in 18 men have been stalked by an intimate partner to the point
that they were fearful for their safety57

Violence by Someone You Know
This topic is an important one because “domestic violence is prevalent in every community,
and affects all people regardless of age, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, gender,
race, religion, or nationality. Physical violence is often accompanied by emotionally abusive
and controlling behavior as part of a much larger, systematic pattern of dominance and
control. Domestic violence can result in physical injury, psychological trauma, and even
death. The devastating consequences of domestic violence can cross generations and last a
lifetime.”59

Sexual Orientation
A person's sexual orientation is their emotional and sexual attraction to a particular sex or
gender. A continuing pattern of romantic or sexual attraction (or a combination of these) to
persons of a given sex or gender. According to the American Psychological Association (APA)
(2016), sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions,
related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.
Some specific orientation is defined in many ways, including heterosexuality (attraction to the
opposite sex/gender), same-sex attraction (previously referred to as homosexuality, which is
an outdated term that many people find offensive because it was previously classified as a
mental illness), bisexuality, polysexuality, or pansexuality (attraction to two, multiple, or all
sexes/genders respectively), and asexuality (no sexual attraction to any sex/gender).

Sexual Orientation on a Continuum
Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey was among the first to conceptualize sexuality as a
continuum rather than a strict dichotomy of gay or straight. To classify this continuum of
heterosexuality and homosexuality, Kinsey et al. (1948) created a seven-point rating scale that
ranged from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. Research done over several
decades has supported this idea that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from
exclusive attraction to the opposite sex/gender to exclusive attraction to the same sex/gender
(Carroll, 2016).
A more contemporary look at sexual orientation as infinite variations of attraction. A closer
examination of The Genderbread Person v2.0 introduced earlier in the chapter illustrates this:

Figure 15.26 – A spectrum of sexual orientation.60

Development of Sexual Orientation
According to current scientific understanding, individuals are usually aware of their sexual
orientation between middle childhood and early adolescence. However, this is not always the
case, and some do not become aware of their sexual orientation until much later in life. It is not
necessary to participate in sexual activity to be aware of these emotional, romantic, and
physical attractions; people can be celibate and still recognize their sexual orientation. Some
researchers argue that sexual orientation is not static and inborn, but is instead fluid and
changeable throughout the lifespan.

Figure 15.27 – This teen couple is at a LGBTQIA pride event.61

There is no scientific consensus regarding the exact reasons why an individual holds a particular
sexual orientation. Research has examined possible biological, developmental, social, and
cultural influences on sexual orientation, but there has been no evidence that links sexual
orientation to one factor (APA, 2016). Biological explanations, that include genetics, hormones,
and birth order, will be explored further. Excess or deficient exposure to hormones during
prenatal development has also been theorized as an explanation for sexual orientation. Onethird of females exposed to abnormal amounts of prenatal androgens, a condition called
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), identify as bisexual or lesbian (Cohen-Bendahan, van de
Beek, & Berenbaum, 2005). In contrast, too little exposure to prenatal androgens may affect
male sexual orientation (Carlson, 2011).

Sexual Orientation Discrimination: The United States is heteronormative, meaning that society
supports heterosexuality as the norm. Consider, for example, that homosexuals are often
asked, "When did you know you were gay?" but heterosexuals are rarely asked, "When did you
know you were straight?" (Ryle, 2011). Living in a culture that privileges heterosexuality has a
significant impact on the ways in which non-heterosexual people are able to develop and
express their sexuality.

Understanding the Acronyms: LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQ+
The letters LGBT refer to a group of individuals that identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and
Transgender. This community includes a diverse group of people from all backgrounds, races,
ethnicities, ages, and socioeconomic statuses.
A Little History
LGB was used to replace the term, “Gay,” in the mid-1980s, but the acronym LGBT became
common in the 1990s. However, recently the term has evolved with the preferred acronym
to LGBTQ. The added “Q” means Questioning or Queer. The addition of “Q” as a term of
questioning includes people that are in the process of exploring their gender or sexual
orientation.
Additionally, the term, “Queer,” can be used as an umbrella term, as the community has
accepted this word to represent anything outside of the dominant narrative. Queer is not
specific to sexual orientation or gender identity and can be used to refer to the community as
a whole. While Queer was used as a derogatory term for decades, it was reclaimed by the
LGBTQ community in the 1990s with the rise of an organization called Queer Nation. As an
activist group out of New York, Queer Nation opposed discrimination of the LGBTQ
community and rejected the heteronormative ideals of society.
What does the plus sign mean?
Recently LGBTQ is also used as LGBTQ+. The plus sign, “+” accounts for many additional
identifications in the community, including transsexual, two-spirit, intersex, asexual,
pansexual, and gender queer. Gender Queer is an umbrella term that can be used for all
gender identities not exclusive to masculine or feminine, including gender fluid, agender,
bigender, pan gender, gender free, genderless, gender variant, and gender non-conforming.
The plus also includes allies or people in support of the LGBTQ community.
While LGBTQ+ or Queer are currently the most common terms, additionally the term,
Rainbow Community, may be used. The important takeaway is that the community will
continue to evolve, and the terminology will evolve with it.62

Open identification of one's sexual orientation may be hindered by homophobia, which
encompasses a range of negative attitudes and feelings toward homosexuality or people who
are identified or perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). It can be
expressed as antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion, or hatred; it may be based on irrational
fear and is sometimes related to religious beliefs (Carroll, 2016). Homophobia is observable in
critical and hostile behavior, such as discrimination and violence on the basis of sexual
orientations that are non- heterosexual. Recognized types of homophobia include
institutionalized homophobia, such as religious and state-sponsored homophobia, and
internalized homophobia in which people with same-sex attractions internalize, or believe,
society's negative views and/or hatred of themselves.
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people regularly experience stigma, harassment, discrimination, and
violence based on their sexual orientation (Carroll, 2016). Research has shown that gay, lesbian,
and bisexual teenagers are at a higher risk of depression and suicide due to exclusion from
social groups, rejection from peers and family, and negative media portrayals of homosexuals
(Bauermeister et al., 2010). Discrimination can occur in the workplace, in housing, at schools,
and in numerous public settings. Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and
misinformation. Major policies to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation have only
come into effect in the United States in the last few years.63

Figure 15.28 - This is an example of discrimination that is portrayed in a high school play. These students from
Mercer Island High School are playing Westboro Baptist Church protestors in the play The Laramie Project that tells
the story of the murder of a gay college student, Matthew Shephard. 64

Adolescent Sexuality
Human sexuality refers to people's sexual interest in and attraction to others, as well as their
capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. Sexuality may be experienced and
expressed in a variety of ways, including thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values,

behaviors, practices, roles, and relationships. These may manifest themselves in biological,
physical, emotional, social, or spiritual aspects. The biological and physical aspects of sexuality
largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual-response cycle
and the basic biological drive that exists in all species. Emotional aspects of sexuality include
bonds between individuals that are expressed through profound feelings or physical
manifestations of love, trust, and care. Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on
one's sexuality, while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others
through sexuality. Sexuality also impacts, and is impacted by cultural, political, legal,
philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life.
The Human Sexual Response Cycle: Sexual motivation, often referred to as libido, is a person's
overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. This motivation is determined by biological,
psychological, and social factors. In most mammalian species, sex hormones control the ability
to engage in sexual behaviors. However, sex hormones do not directly regulate the ability to
have sexual intercourse or to copulate in primates (including humans); rather, they are only one
influence on the motivation to engage in sexual behaviors. Social factors, such as work and
family also have an impact, as do internal psychological factors like personality and stress. Sex
drive may also be affected by hormones, medical conditions, medications, lifestyle stress,
pregnancy, and relationship issues.
The human sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that
take place during sexual activity. According to Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin (1948), the cycle
consists of four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

Societal Views on Sexuality: Society's views on sexuality are influenced by everything from
religion to philosophy, and they have changed throughout history and are continuously
evolving. Historically, religion has been the greatest influence on sexual behavior in the United
States; however, in more recent years, peers and the media have emerged as two of the
strongest influences, particularly among American teens (Potard, Courtois, & Rusch, 2008).
Media Influences on Sexuality: Media in the form of television, magazines, movies, music,
online, etc., continues to shape what is deemed appropriate or normal sexuality, targeting
everything from body image to products meant to enhance sex appeal. Media serves to
perpetuate a number of social scripts about sexual relationships and the sexual roles of men
413 | C h i l d G r o w t h a n d D e v e l o p m e n t

and women, many of which have been shown to have both empowering and problematic
effects on people's (especially women's) developing sexual identities and sexual attitudes.
Cultural Differences with Sexuality: In the West, premarital sex is normative by the late teens,
more than a decade before most people enter marriage. In the United States and Canada, and
in northern and Eastern Europe, cohabitation is also normative; most people have at least one
cohabiting partnership before marriage. In southern Europe, cohabiting is still taboo, but
premarital sex is tolerated in emerging adulthood. In contrast, both premarital sex and
cohabitation remain rare and forbidden throughout Asia. Even dating is discouraged until the
late twenties, when it would be a prelude to a serious relationship leading to marriage. In crosscultural comparisons, about three fourths of emerging adults in the United States and Europe
report having had premarital sexual relations by age 20, versus less than one fifth in Japan and
South Korea (Hatfield & Rapson, 2006).65

Antisocial Behavior in Adolescence
Bullies, Victims, and the Bystander
Bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves
a real or perceived power imbalance. Further, the aggressive behavior happens more than once
or has the potential to be repeated. There are different types of bullying. They are detailed in
the table below.

Figure 15.29 – Cyberbullying.66

The Bystander Effect
The discussion of bullying highlights the problem of witnesses not intervening to help a victim.
Researchers Latané and Darley (1968) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect.
The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to
help a victim or person in distress. Instead, they just watch what is happening. Social
psychologists hold that we make these decisions based on the social situation, not our own
personality variables. Why do you think bystanders don’t get help? What are the benefits to
helping? What are the risks? It is very likely you listed more costs than benefits to helping. In
many situations, bystanders likely feared for their own lives—if they went to help, the attacker
might harm them. However, how difficult would it be to make a phone call to the police? Social
psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation. Diffusion of
responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is
spread throughout the group (Bandura, 1999). Have you ever passed an accident on the
freeway and assumed that a victim or certainly another motorist has already reported the
accident? In general, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely any one person will
help.67

Antisocial Behaviors, Violence, and Child Abuse
Antisocial Behaviors
According to the American Academy of Psychiatry (2018),
Most kids will act up or become disruptive or defiant sometimes. Disruptive and
conduct disorders, however, involve much more severe and longer-lasting
behaviors than typical, short-lived episodes. Disruptive, impulse-control and
conduct disorders refer to a group of disorders that include oppositional defiant
disorder, conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania and
pyromania. These disorders can cause people to behave angrily or aggressively

toward people or property. They may have difficulty controlling their emotions
and behavior and may break rules or laws. An estimated 6 percent of children
are affected by oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder.68
Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD): There is a recurrent pattern of negative, defiant,
disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures. It is important to remember that
this is toward authority figures and not their peers. This occurs outside of normal
developmental levels and leads to impairment in functioning (Lack, 2010).69
Conduct Disorder (CD): Children with Conduct Disorder (CD) show acts of aggression towards
others and animals. Children with conduct disorder (CD) usually show little to no compassion or
concern for others or their feelings. Also, concern for the well-being of others is at a minimum.
Children also perceive the actions and intentions of others as more harmful and threatening
than they actually are and respond with what they feel is reasonable and justified aggression.
They may lack feelings of guilt or remorse. Since these individuals learn that expressing guilt or
remorse may help in avoiding or lessening punishment, it may be difficult to evaluate when
their guilt or remorse is genuine. Individuals will also try and place blame on others for the
wrong doings that they had committed.

Figure 15.30 - Children with conduct disorders show acts of aggression towards others and animals. 70

Children with conduct disorders (CD) tend to have lower levels of self-esteem. Children
diagnosed with conduct disorders (CD) are typically characterized as being easily irritable and
often reckless, as well as having many temper tantrums despite their projected “tough” image
portrayed to society. Conduct Disorder (CD) often accompanies early onset of sexual behavior,

drinking, smoking, use of illegal drugs, and reckless acts. Illegal drug use may increase the risk of
the disorder persisting. The disorder may lead to school suspension or expulsion, problems at
work, legal difficulties, STD’s, unplanned pregnancy, and injury from fights or accidents. Suicidal
ideation and attempts occur at a higher rate than expected.71

Violence and Abuse
Violence and abuse are among the most disconcerting of the challenges that today’s families
face. Abuse can occur between spouses, between parent and child, as well as between other
family members. The frequency of violence among families is difficult to determine because
many cases of spousal abuse and child abuse go unreported. In any case, studies have shown
that abuse (reported or not) has a major impact on families and society as a whole.72

Adolescent Child Abuse
Children and teens are among the most helpless victims of abuse. In 2010, there were more
than 3.3 million reports of child abuse involving an estimated 5.9 million children (Child Help
2011). Three-fifths of child abuse reports are made by professionals, including teachers, law
enforcement personnel, and social services staff. The rest are made by anonymous sources,
other relatives, parents, friends, and neighbors. Child abuse may come in several forms, the
most common is neglect (78.3 percent), followed by physical abuse (10.8 percent), sexual abuse
(7.6 percent), psychological maltreatment (7.6 percent), and medical neglect (2.4 percent)
(Child Help 2011). Some children suffer from a combination of these forms of abuse. The
majority (81.2 percent) of perpetrators are parents; 6.2 percent are other relatives.73

Does Corporal Punishment Constitute Child Abuse?
Physical abuse in children may come in the form of beating, kicking, throwing, choking,
hitting with objects, burning, or other methods. Injury inflicted by such behavior is
considered abuse even if the parent or caregiver did not intend to harm the child. Other
types of physical contact that are characterized as discipline (spanking, for example) are not
considered abuse as long as no injury results (Child Welfare Information Gateway 2008).
This issue is rather controversial among modern-day people in the United States. While some
parents feel that physical discipline, or corporal punishment, is an effective way to respond
to bad behavior, others feel that it is a form of abuse. According to a poll conducted by ABC
News, 65 percent of respondents approve of spanking and 50 percent said that they
sometimes spank their child. But in the U.S., the majority of mental health professionals, as
well as other professionals such as physicians and child welfare personnel, do not support the
use of physical punishment.
Tendency toward physical punishment may be affected by culture and education. Those who
live in the South are more likely than those who live in other regions to spank their child.
Those who do not have a college education are also more likely to spank their child (Crandall
2011). Currently, 23 states officially allow spanking in the school system; however, many
parents may object and school officials must follow a set of clear guidelines when
administering this type of punishment (Crandall 2011).
Decades of research have yielded more than 500 studies examining the impact of physical
punishment on children (Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016). Within the past 15 years, several
meta-analyses have attempted to synthesize this body of research. In a highly publicized
meta-analysis, Gershoff (2002) concluded that physical punishment is not only ineffective,
but also harmful. It may lead to aggression by the victim, particularly in those who are
spanked at a young age (Berlin 2009).
Debates about parental use of physical punishment have been ongoing in the USA for
decades. Calls to “move beyond” the research, or to “end the debate,” have become
commonplace (e.g., Durrant & Ensom, 2017; MacMillan & Mikton, 2017). Three questions, it
seems, sit at the center of these debates. Is physical punishment of children a Human Rights
Issue? Is physical punishment effective? Is physical punishment harmful?75

Emerging Adulthood: The Bridge Between Adolescence and Adulthood
The next stage of development is emerging adulthood and is characterized as an in-between
time where identity exploration is focused on work and love, which occurs from approximately
18 years of age to the mid to late 20s.

When does a person become an adult? There are many ways to answer this question. In the
United States, you are legally considered an adult at 18 years old, but other definitions of
adulthood vary widely; in sociology, for example, a person may be considered an adult when
they become self-supporting, choose a career, get married, or start a family. The ages at which
we achieve these milestones vary from person to person as well as from culture to culture. For
example, 50 years ago, a young adult with a high school diploma could immediately enter the
workforce and climb the corporate ladder. That is no longer the case, a Bachelor’s and even
graduate degrees are required more and more often—even for entry-level jobs (Arnett, 2000).
In addition, many students are taking longer (five or six years) to complete a college degree as a
result of working and going to school at the same time. After graduation, many young adults
return to the family home because they have difficulty finding a job.

Figure 15.32 – Emerging adulthood.76

This is a relatively newly defined period of lifespan development, Jeffrey Arnett (2000) explains
that emerging adulthood is neither adolescence nor is it young adulthood. Individuals in this
age period have left behind the relative dependency of childhood and adolescence, but have
not yet taken on the responsibilities of adulthood. “Emerging adulthood is a time of life when
many different directions remain possible, when little about the future is decided for certain,
when the scope of independent exploration of life’s possibilities is greater for most people than
it will be at any other period of the life course” (Arnett, 2000, p. 469).77
